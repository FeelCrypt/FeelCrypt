but not everyone can afford $30 fees to open and close channels
One of the best Reddit threads I've seen in my life. I hope this is pinned for a month...
Trolling is the only thing this sub is good at.
Someone pass the popcorn.
As long as most channels are not close to being empty I don't see the problem.
He must be referring to the fact that there are now more LN nodes than Bcash nodes...oh, wait...I'm mixing up my Latin prefixes again...
"It cannot implode because its always in 'beta'.  

But do ask yourself what does imploding look like to you for Lightening - if no matter what you see the answer is 'it is still in beta' - congratulations, you are a member of a religion..

I am a Bitcoin Cash supporter, but I know exactly what it would take for me to dump it in the trash.

1) Censorship becomes rampant

2) Fees rise

3) instant ""confirmation"" or 0-conf removed"
"There was one monumental screw up I remember in Bitcoin which was an integer overflow bug where someone generated 180 million Bitcoin's or something. This was fixed in a few hours but required first and only blockchain rollback.

Some bugs Sergio L raised but I don't think any were exploited on mainnet  and they were just DOS anyway by making block/TX verification take far too long.

Beauty of Bitcoin is that the protocol is so simple, and if you read the source (before crap and technical debt such as Segwit was introduced) it's pretty simple and comprehensible as the best ideas are.

Now this LN thing is something else, and you have to bare in mind that this is still the simple version with a crappy temporary routing protocol until they win the Nobel Prize and solve the routing problem that has baffled top scientists for decades.

Bug or not this is a serious product failure, Bitcoin in all its years has never been so responsible for losing money, the only people losing money on Bitcoin are:-

1) Those forgetting their keys (obviously)

2) Those sending to invalid addresses (generally programmers as most wallets have verification/checksumming)

3) Those programming with Bitcoin and forgetting to send extra output (the change) back to themselves so they send far too much to a miner.

I can't think of any other cases where people have lost Bitcoin."
Were you?
"The ideal blocksize doesn't exist. There is no reason not to increase it. As it is the Cote fork is just a testnet for Segwit and LN. 

As it is LN is horribly designed, and makes Bitcoin less user friendly, all while adding more problems while not really fixing the scaling problem.

So far LN has no trustless routing protocall, and so shouldn't have been started yet. It is like testing a house before designing the foundation."

"Every time a transaction is done, the state of the whole graph, by definition, changes, and needs to be communicated to the whole LN mesh network, so money routes can be recalculated and reevaluated. With. Every. Single. Transaction.

Sure there are all kinds of more of less sophisticated ways to ease the burden of route recalculation, but at the end of the day, users are always dealing with a graph in constant flux, where channel capacities can never be acertained."

You like  myth that larger blocks lead to centralisation don't you? So far no one has a legitimate explanation as for how it would centralise the network. They handwoven about storage, and ISP bandwidth, but both of those are cheap and plentiful.

+1. Never made another account to post there though.
"Funny, because the BCH teams are the only ones looking into effective scaling solutions. Thru are not just increasing the blocksize. They are looking at ways to compress the data before sending it to make scaling much more effective.

As it is BCH will likely scale faster than LN would be capable of. As it is LN needs larger blocks to scale as well."
LN imploded?  When?  How so?  Links?

"Yeah another r/btc/top post that is not actually about Bitcoin Cash.

"> implements LN, makes bitcoin core more centralized

Huh? Do you even know what lightning network is? 

Anyone can open a lightning channel, that means it's not centralized **by definition**."
Just let them dig their own grave. Only repercussions I'm worried about is once btc is toast, gov will make a huge fuss and ban cryptos outright
Can you explain what you mean by consensus about channel states? 
lol no you don’t understand this is “epically brilliant”
"down voted for saying what fee rate is working for me :)

"pretty funny

Hang on I want to buy this coffee but I need to spend 50 bucks on spinning up a LN node real quick

""Money of the future"""
"No.  Eventually your LN wallet will have access to your BTC on chain.  You will tell it to open a channel probably with a well known, well connected LN Hub with the amount of BTC you want to have readily available for a long period of time.  Note that your LN wallet will need access to your private key to fund the channel.  Once funded, it manages your half of a multi-sig address on the block chain along with your channel partner.

At some future point, if your funds run low, it can be replenished by either receiving BTC over LN from others (i.e. you got paid), or you can top off your balance from your BTC on the block chain.

> 50 bucks on spinning up a LN node real quick

This was a joke.  It's an exaggeration of the layer 1 fees and the layer 2 funding required to make small purchases.  "
What's faster than instant tx through 0 conf?
"You don't need a blockchain in the first place for off chain transactions. So off chain to replace on chain is retarded. You are first creating a problem that does not exist and then offer a solution to an entirely made up problem. 

"
Good for you. That is not the norm at all.
Can you show me SPV wallet for LN?
You can't receive money without being online. You can't prevent old states from settling without being online.
"> It requires the same online presence as regular bitcoin wallets that notify you when you get a payment. 

No. In LN, AFAIU, the holder of the keys needs to be online for any payment in his direction *to be made*. Both sides of the channel must be online simultaneously to exchange messages for any payment, in any direction, to happen.

In Bitcoin, I can receive a payment at any moment, unknowingly, and get online to see its notification whenever I want."
"well that kindof makes sense.  

> A guy walks into a bar.  Looks around and says, ""I don't want to drink in a shithole like this!""  Bouncer, promptly ejects him from the bar.


Actually makes sense."
"> The reality is that LN's ""always online"" is more like check in every day or so

AFAIU this can only be the case if the other side of your channel is permanently online. Meaning, it is a service, a company, like a bank. Very different from the fake idea they were trying to sell of ""Alice making channels with Bob"" (private individuals having channels among each other to bypass the need of banks)"
You forgot to mention that in order to make LN payment you have to run full node. Now tell me, how can you run full node with 150GB blockchain on a phone?
"A payment-only channel defeats the ""hub and spoke"" model of LN that solves all the scaling issues of BTC...

Oh, to be a big blocker."
I recently got permabanned from /r/bitcoin because I commented that I was accidentally in the sub and had no interest in being in their censored shithole lol.
">  50 bucks on spinning up a LN node real quick

you think this statement is true?"
Off chain transactions will always be fast
It seems questionable if light clients/SPV is compatible with LN, at least at this point in time they don't seem implemented. People are saying to just trust someone else's full node, but why not just use PayPal if you are doing that.
SPV wallet - this problem was solved in 2012.
If you want to receive, you have to always be online. If you want to ensure your channel is not closed prematurely, you have to watch the blockchain for channel closing transactions via SPV.
"Current mainnet implementations are like that. But its not a requirement to open a channel that you also have a full node. A channel is basically just a tx that you update with the other peer. Now if you just spend money on that channel you can never have an old state that is not in your favor, which eliminates the need to check the blockchain once in a while for guys trying to close channels in old states in their favor.

That makes LN possible as spending channels in a pretty simple mobile app - like eclair that I talked about. Try it if you don't believe me."
"Yes and LNs are completely fall back able to the regular bitcoin chain. LN is a phone call, bitcoin transactions are email. Both have their uses and their weakness. 

You need to go online around once per week to check for fraudulent transactions if you have any channels with old states that are not in your favor. But it's possible to pet a watch tower handle that check in return for a part of the penalty bounty you'd get if someone tries to defraud you."
"There's been a misunderstanding. I recommend to use an SPV wallet instead of LN.

SPV wallets are lightweight, only storing block headers, and query nodes for transaction information that they verify is in a block using the merkle tree."
I don't even need an exchange I have enough local people here I know that give me cash (CAD) for Bitcoin cash went needed. They even give me the money before I make the transaction because they trust me. 
Decentralized exchanges, for one.
I get the feeling they don't miss you either
"Exactly! There is no point to anything offchain right now. That's like being: Hey we have a great solution to a problem that exists right now (how to have electronic money without a third party involved) but lets not use it, instead let's solve a second problem! (one that does not exist). 

Onchain is going to work for the next 20 or 30 years. So why offchain, answer me that? 

Only people that don't understand the chain in the first place will mumble about offchain. "
"Except you don't need to show me the door when i am already walking out.  

Anyhow, fuck /r/bitcoin what I need is a way to ban them so I don't end up accidentally reading their propaganda again."
What the hell are you even getting at?
You almost sound like a shaman chanting some spell to rid the sub of this evil troll.
"You literally said (that you said):

> I commented that I was accidentally in the sub and had no interest in being in their censored shithole

So as /u/Churn put it, it's right.  You walked into the bar and said ""Oops, didn't mean to walk into this shit hole"", so they told you to fuck off and not come back then, makes sense really, if you walked into my house and said that you'd be firmly shown the door, whether you exit in the horizontal or vertical position is up to you (I'm a nice guy like that, really).

Remember this is reddit, we like to feel like it's all open and honest, but you're actually here at the pleasure (or allowance) of the sub admin/mods.  _Here_ that is Roger Ver, if he wanted to (or any of the mods), he could ban you too, or take the sub private."
Well, that's not wrong!
Off chain by definition is everything in the world not recorded in the Bitcoin blockchain. I am not to intresssted in Reddit comments not recorded on reddit as long as reddit works just fine. If ever we need to limit our comments to 12 words because reddit is out of money and everything now runs of one raspberry pi with 1 GB of disk space then maybe a off reddit comment system will be a solution. Until then I am just  going to type my comments directly on reddit and my bitcoin transactions in the blockchain. But feel free to leave me a offreddit reply. I can't promise I will ever read it though, it would be hard for me to find and I have better things to do then to look for reddit comments in places where one should not put reddit comments. 
"Payment-only channels can't solve all the scaling issues of BTC; payment-only means that the hub-and-spoke model doesn't work. Lightning Network is uneconomical if users can only deplete channels."
"More like ""Oops, I didn't mean to walk into this place, I'm leaving.""  

""Oh, yeah?  You aren't allowed in here, never come back!!!""

""Oh....ok."""
"There are several errors in your post.

1. Your LN wallet will **not** have access to your BTC onchain.
2. Your LN client will open several channels to several different nodes, some of which might be well connected nodes ie. hubs.
3. Your LN client does **not** need your private keys. It needs some private keys but you you can just generate a new address and send some of your coin there and let that address generate the LN channels.
4. A LN channel is not a multi-sig adress managed by two people. A LN channel is two separate time locked transactions and a trade of unpublished transactions with those locked funds where every new transaction contains the secret to unlock the punishment state of the earlier transaction.
5. LN channels can live for a very long time. Funding a channel is a one time fee. Currently fees are really low.

I don't understand what you mean by ""layer 2 funding""."
Throwing money at the clerk.
Off chain transactions eventually become on chain transactions though. Maybe
There is some merkle tree cryptographic verification going on, too. I wouldn't consider SPV simply asking multiple nodes and trusting if enough match, as being an accurate characterization.
No because LN is still in beta. Where are you going to move your goal posts once SPV LN clients are out?
there are light clients that don't download the whole chain. find something else to complain about perhaps?
"It requires the same online presence as regular bitcoin wallets that notify you when you get a payment. So the battery thing is not a real argument.

But yeah, if you go offline for a week or more (eg: going to climb mount Everest), then you may want to close your channels beforehand, at least until the solution is inevitably coded up."
Every SPV wallet ie every phone bitcoin wallet trusts other people's nodes. The key is to ask several different random nodes the same thing.
"You don't need that, especially if you only use the channel to pay - then there will never be a state thats not in your favor.

/u/adolfaberHitler you can check out eclair, its only on testnet still though, but it will give you a pretty good idea of how user friendly LN can be. Just get some testnet btc and send to eclair. Open some channels and try to buy some testnet coffees."
Nothing makes LN easy.  The whole idea is to make things difficult.  Don't worry the Department of Lightning Network will figure this out for everybody equally and very fairly.
LN requires an always online presence. Either you'll burn your mobile's battery, or you'll pay a watchtower.

Or, just pay cash or credit
You can trust a 0-conf transaction if you can trust the transaction makes it on the next block. Which it does.
It is for Core fees and what they consider a non-spam transaction amount. Core only wants to support people purchasing the stock for the store.
"Trust me, more people in /r/btc understand Lightning than people in /r/bitcoin.  

sure, there are many useful idiots in /r/bitcoin who think they understand LN, and will jump into any thread repeating what they've seen others say... but after one or two questions you'll always end up with, ""oh well I'm not an expert, that's the way I thought it worked...""  

See it for yourself next time there's an actual discussion in /r/bitcoin about how LN works... be sure to read a couple of comments deep, you have to get passed the standard canned responses that say all the amazing things it **will do** to get to the fact that they have no idea **how** it will do those things."

Store of Value, with IOUs, rate limited to 8 tx/s during a crisis.
"The delay is 1 - 3 seconds because of some dirty code that Bitcoin Cash inherited from core devs doing their best to make Bitcoin as slow as possible. Originally 99% of the network sees a tx in about half a second.  Bitcoin transactions have always been intended to be instant. Otherwise that is the fucking point. Satoshi writes in the introduction of his paper: 
>With the possibility of reversal, the need for trust spreads. Merchants must be wary of their customers, hassling them for more information than they would otherwise need

You really think Satosh designed a system that would take THIS hassle away and replace it with the hassle of seller and buyer having to wait 10 minutes? 

Even 5 seconds of wait time is already WAY to much. Technically speaking unless you are transferring huge sums of money a Bitcoin payment can be finalised in under a second with a lower risk at fraud then Visa and with lower costs. 

That's what it is all about. Otherwise what benefits can it possibly have to offer in comparison with traditional banking?

Imagine doing groceries and after payment everybody in the store goes and sits on a chair for 10 minutes ... orl longer .... waiting ... waiting ... waiting.

**""Oh hi Mark, no I am still in the store, yeah must be variance again ... man I am so unlucky last time I had to buy a bread the variance was like fucking 40 minutes, I am telling you we had a way better world when Visa was still around. Yeah man, I know you are to young to remember it but Visa was great. It would only take 2 seconds before the bread was yours and you could even pay when the battery in your phone was dead because the card would work without power.""** 

BITCOIN IS NOT ABOUT SOLVING PROBLEMS  THAT BITCOIN FIRST CREATED ITSELF THAT IS FUCKING STUPID.

@slbbb You are a sir and a legend for preserving such a calm and peaceful attitude. I wish there were more people like you in the world :) 
"To get back to those levels it would have to go up in price and popularity WAY more than it was than, because in meantime a lot of transactions started using SegWit and batching. Currently, BTC network can receive way more transactions that it could few months ago.
But that is not a point...point is that whoever tested LN did it worst way possible. One could wonder, is it on purpouse or just lack of knowlage."
"> look at mid dec and onward for the trend

Ridiculous. Look at the whole year 2017 for the trend of your cripple coin. "
Both methods of develpement have merits with pros and cons.  Too bad the camp you belong in engages in censorship which is reason enough to abandon the BTC project.
Redditor foundanotherscam has low karma in this subreddit.
"I don't know what to tell you.  Somehow they accidentally created a better coin that BTC.  Bitcoin Cash has 0-conf and near-zero fees.  Doesn't have the complexity of Segwith and LN.  So until I see flaws in how BCH works or if the roadmap goes awry, I don't see why I should knock it.

I hold BTC and BCH - either wins, I win.  don't be married to any one idea."
"What do you mean they accomplished nothing? They accomplished a new altcoin called bitcoin cash which they can milk now to make even more money with.  their propaganda was succesfull
"
And if price of BTC goes up, even 1 satoshi would be too much, and LN is offering solution for that in form of milisatoshies.
When we get a 200K TX backlog the fees can literally be anything from $0.00 to $0.02.  Agreed. 
Than eClair is bad wallet (using fees that are WAY too hogh for current state of network) or it was used wrong way. I didint use eClair as im perfectly happy paying 0.01$ fee with my Electrum + it let's me type in custom fee too and if i go too low, i can replayer it with higher.
So you really think someone spent north of a quarter billion dollars to inconvenience some bitcoin users?  And they literally accomplished nothing.
Because current boosted limit (SegWit, batching etc.) is not enough and fee would go up sooner or later if it would stop on that. It's always good to have multiplayer when you are playing big number games.
And this exactly why a compromise would have made sense.  We want 1MB, but you guys want 8MB? - okay how about 2?  BAM that alone would have kept the community together for another 8 months.
BTC will stop working as soon as the backlog grows.  BTC cannot handle lunch-hour at a medium sized university.  The fees will sky rocket if a backlog on BTC persists for a few days.  So BTC is broken and I certainly wouldn't base a business around something that breaks as it becomes more popular.
"Is ETHs scaling to move the ERC20 coins off chain...?!?

I think the closer analogy for BTC would be Satoshi's dice on the LN...which would be a good test case (comparable to the original effort)"
