"Don't get too excited.  Miner-dumpers are probably going to end up driving the price down.  This is the best thing that could ever happen to a guy with a large mining farm.

So much hashrate has moved to BCH, it's churning out a block every minute or two.  Assuming it remains profitable to mine it will hit 2016 blocks in a couple days and the difficulty will adjust sharply upwards.  What happens then?"

So not hostile to switch to Bitcoin Cash from Bitcoin if it is more profitable, but hostile to switch back if switching back is more profitable?  Is that correct?
Like intentionally pumping a coin right as the difficulty lowers?

Negative feedback means you feed back in the negation of the error signal."

"There gazillion of scrypt coins, and somehow miners have figured out how to mine coins without kicking in huge difficulty changes all the time.

I think once bcc Vs btc prices stabilise, hashrate will stop jumping so much every adjustment.

Frankly, I do hope that when reach the next adjustment, there will be no legacy chain to talk about."
">can you imagine if every miner always switched to the most profitable chain? 


Yes, but they won't. Miners' own determination of the short to long-term stability of a coin, personal factors and just general human inertia are going to cause much more gradual fluctuations."
Yes, to a 4x increase.
"> can you imagine if every miner always switched to the most profitable chain? 

That would be bad for *both* coins, and therefore not in the miner's interest.  Wildly varying confirmation times is worse for users, because they don't know how long something will take.  A stable average confirmation time is better.  Although finding blocks is a random process, you can at least predict the average time for, say 6 confirmations."
BCH is the ticker for Bitcoin cash
ok thanks. G'night. 
Odd then
No, but you're not the one paying for them either.
481387 on the core chain was 0.26KB. This doesn't prove anything.
"[Yes](https://www.amazon.com/Antminer-~4-73TH-25W-Bitcoin-Miner/dp/B014OGCP6W), you can buy mining hardware for less than that.  Whether the hardware would be *profitable* is a different question.  The one I linked to draws 1.25 kW, and if you are paying retail for electricity, it may not be.

Many people these days mine other cryptocurrencies (altcoins = alternative coins), which can often be done with standard graphics cards.  If you already have a suitable one, you can skip the hardware cost, but you still have to pay whatever the cost of running it is.  If you want one of the flavors of bitcoin in the end, the altcoin can be traded on an exchange.

My knowledge of mining is out of date, since I stopped in 2013, when my graphics card was no longer competitive.  Since then, I just bought bitcoins on exchanges or through personal transactions."
And it's up how much in the last few days?
It doesn't get back into equilibrium. It over shoots every time because it didn't take into account miners switching.
No
"Comparing it to trade volume does not make much sense. Especially if there are no or very low trading fees.

It's not the same. All the money locked up in payment channels, can't be in cold storage.
"It should, but can you imagine if every miner always switched to the most profitable chain? there would be very long periods of total freeze on one chain until the difficulty adjusts on the other.

Transaction fee's can alleviate the problem somewhat, because when many high fee's pile up, it can make mining a block on that chain more valuable. 

BC has an advantage in this situation, because it can add fee's from a lot more transactions, in addition to the other difficulty adjustment mechanism which doesn't have to wait 2016 blocks."
Yes, a factor of 4 (in both directions).
Notice that Bitcoin may need a similar fix.
I'm 5 and don't know what BCH is
This wont be an instant thing. Give it some time. The difficulty drop only happened an hour ago, it will take the markets some time to adjust. Go ahead and get some sleep, and hopefully in the morning wake up to piles of money.
iirc it's ~5% chance naturally
BCH doesn't have segwit right? I can't believe it if true but would like confirmation. Does this mean BCH will still have mallubility and not have micropayments?

Not to mention that the shenanigans between BCC and BTC are a big driver for alts.
low-tier... love it! lodl!
Ya its down 11% in the last 24 hours, so you have an inverted reality if thats what you call rising.
That should provide stability  tho. Both coins will find an equilibrium that they rest at. If one chain goes up or down in profitability, more miners will mine that network, until it gets back into equilibrium
So as stable as the price
Bubble theory at its finest
That's less than half of one percent of the daily volume. Also, I don't think all mined coins will be immediately dumped. The mystery miner(s) mined Bitcoin Cash at a loss for two weeks, so profit is obviously not #1 to them.
">Thing here is that BCH can adjust diff downwards quickly. 

The emergency adjustment only happens if there is an extreme lack of hashpower. Without miners manipulating it (e.g. by spoofing timestamps), it's very unlikely to activate ever again."
"It's definitely a possibility. However I think this swing will be the worst as nobody really expected BCH to take off so fast so high. So any swing mining swing in the future will probably be lower than this  as you'll always have more miners on bch as before waiting on that next increase in profitability.

"You are right to feel that way.  And many miners will feel that way as well.

Most profitable outcome for miners over time would be for Bitcoin to thrive while Bitcoin Cash also survives with a large marketcap.  They have almost no long term financial incentive to actively participate in killing the Bitcoin chain.  Some will switch some hash, but mass defection all at once would be malicious."
"You know nothing about me, yet you jump to conclusions regarding my motivations.

"> (1) Wildly varying confirmation times are bad for both coins. The optimal solution is for miners to split their hash power, either individually or as a group.

This is a tragedy of the commons. Even if it's best to be stable for the group. For the individual it's best to mine what's most profitable right now.

> (2) Mining farms have to pay their electric bills. Until places to convert Bitcoin Cash to local fiat are as widely available as for Bitcoin 1MB, they will have a preference for the latter. This is temporary, though.

It doesn't need to be widely available. A miner only needs one place where they can sell their coins. As long as that one place works, they're fine."
">Markets are inherently self correction.

not in all cases... to create a stable oscillation which does not damp you need a nonlinear feedback and a delay.  The price signal produces the former, the time between difficulty adjustments provides the latter."

Why do you think having both coins survive is optimal? I'm pretty sure having one definite Bitcoin that can scale is much better for market confidence.
Suit yourself. 
"> This is a tragedy of the commons. Even if it's best to be stable for the group. For the individual it's best to mine what's most profitable right now.

The majority of mining power talk to each other (witness the New York Agreement).  Thus they *de facto* form a cartel which can work in their common interest.  If they were completely disconnected, then what you claim might happen.

Historically, the tragedy of the commons, as in overgrazing common land, didn't happen that often.  The commons was shared land in a village, and the villagers knew each other and whose sheep or cattle were being grazed there.  They had agreements about how many and how long the livestock could graze, and violators could be punished.

It happens more commonly today with, for example, western ranchers overgrazing federal land.  The BLM staff are not as local and don't count the herds, so you can get away with it more easily.  Environmental pollution is also harder to track to the source, so people get away with it."
"They make the most money mining both.  I guess really whatever creates the largest combined marketcap.  You could be right that having only one would be best.  I definitely think it is important that there be only one ""Bitcoin.""  It will lose value as digital gold if there is too much confusion or if it appears easily to duplicate. "
"9mb total capacity better than lower capacity... especially if you favour big blocks.

LN is a better solution for tracking coffee purchases or dice roll bets."
The mining pool operators are not all the holders of mining power. Individual miners move at will between pools, including pools that were never a party to the agreement.
lol, for a second i was wondering what black lives matter has to do with grazing, but then I realized you meant the bureau of land mgmt.
(Â°.Â°)
You don't need 2 chains for LN. Though I don't believe LN will work for coffee or betting.
LN will work like a low fee debit card bank account, that you have the power to close at any time.  For sure, its best for small txs/ mobile wallets.
If it's only on testnet, it can't work great for coffee purchases. Why would a coffee merchant accept money they can't actually spend? Or if they just close the payment channel to spend your payment, why would you open a payment channel that's just going to be closed, instead of using a normal transaction?
"Why does that require 2 chains?

And no it won't. Because the recipient won't be able to spend the money until the channel is closed, the use cases will be very limited."
"It's on testnet because main net doesn't have segwit active yet, it's a few days away. 

And yes, even when it activates it will take some time for people to start using it, but it works and it's great! 

>Or if they just close the payment channel to spend your payment, why would you open a payment channel that's just going to be closed, instead of using a normal transaction?

Because most businesses don't need to spend your $2 immediately and since the money is guaranteed anyway why not allow you the convenience of low fees and instant purchases? 

Plus, because of LN routing, you don't even need to have a channel open with each business, so they can't even close the channel if it's not directly connected to them. "
any side can close the channel when they want.  it doesn't require 2 chains.  Non LN txs will still be a thing.
"> businesses don't need to spend your $2 immediately

If they don't spend my $2, they'll have to spend someone else's $2 from their payment channel?

> because of LN routing

I thought routing wasn't solved yet. Can you link to any new info about LN routing?

I have no doubt that LN can work technically. I just can't see if work economically, except for a few use cases. So testnet means very little to me since you can't test economic behavior on testnet."
"Didn't you bring up LN as a reason for why having both chains survive is optimal?

If your channel gets closed by the other party after one huge, it's rather pointless."
">>businesses don't need to spend your $2 immediately

>If they don't spend my $2, they'll have to spend someone else's $2 from their payment channel?

Keyword: _immediately_ 

Yes, eventually they'll need the money but why not let you use the channel for a month before closing it? It improves customer satisfaction with no added cost. 

>I thought routing wasn't solved yet. Can you link to any new info about LN routing?

I'm honestly not sure, but I think the issue is with dynamic routing like internet packets. Simply routing through a hub is simple enough. 

>So testnet means very little to me since you can't test economic behavior on testnet.

What economic behavior do you need to test for something like this? You either open the channel directly with the business or with a hub that takes a fee for allowing you to connect to multiple businesses without creating new channels for each one. 

More complicated use cases might be possible but these two are simple enough that I can't understand what economic issues you think might happen. "
"> Simply routing through a hub

A hub would have to lock up huge amounts of if its own money. Where are they going to get that money?

> What economic behavior do you need to test for something like this?

Let's say I want to send $2 to the coffee merchant using LN through the hub. If this is the first time the coffee merchant receives money through LN the hub would have to open a channel to them. The hub can't use my $2 in that channel because those are still locked up in my channel. So they would have to pay those $2 themselves. But it only makes sense to open a payment channel if you can use it many times, so It should probably contain at least $100-$1000. So now, because of my $2 payment, the hub is required to lock up $100 of its own money in a payment channel for the coffee merchant. This just doesn't make economic sense to me.

In addition, the hub would need to constantly create new transactions automatically, so all the private keys need to be in a hot wallet exposed to the internet. The risk is just not worth it."
"> A hub would have to lock up huge amounts of if its own money. Where are they going to get that money?

The same way every other business gets investment, I'd guess? The exchanges could probably open some hubs, BitPay a few others as well.

They would only have to lock up an amount equivalent to their throughput plus a healthy margin for usage spikes.

>  The hub can't use my $2 in that channel because those are still locked up in my channel. So they would have to pay those $2 themselves.

Yes

> So now, because of my $2 payment, the hub is required to lock up $100 of its own money in a payment channel for the coffee merchant.

But those $100 aren't locked up just for you, they can serve any of their other customers. So really they only have to lock up an amount similar to the transaction throughput they see.

> In addition, the hub would need to constantly create new transactions automatically, so all the private keys need to be in a hot wallet exposed to the internet. 

Is that really that much different from what exchanges already do? 

> The risk is just not worth it.

They can set their fees, so they can decide how much is worth the risk."
"> Is that really that much different from what exchanges already do?

Yes! Competent exchanges keep 95-99% of the coins they manage in cold storage.

> They can set their fees, so they can decide how much is worth the risk.

If the fees are too high, the whole thing becomes pointless. See how you can't test this on testnet?"
"> Yes! Competent exchanges keep 95-99% of the coins they manage in cold storage.

Yes, but it's the exact same idea, a hub can also keep most of their buffer in cold storage when the usage is low and bring it out when needed. Over time this can get more efficient as they learn the usage patterns of their users.

> If the fees are too high, the whole thing becomes pointless. See how you can't test this on testnet?

Fair point, but I don't think the risk is as high as you think to warrant very high fees. But you're right, we'll need to wait to know for sure.

"
">Though I don't believe LN will work for coffee or betting.

There's already an android LN wallet for the Bitcoin testnet and it's great for coffee purchases and such, it's instantaneous (~1sec) and completely secure!

It's called eclair wallet, PM me your address if you want some testnet Bitcoin's, you can then try LN transactions at the demo site 'starblocks'. 

It currently only allows payment via LN, not receiving, because for receiving to be secure you need to have the wallet periodically monitor the blockchain. If you are only paying you don't have to monitor the blockchain because if a previous state of the LN channel is broadcast you're actually paying less than you wanted to. "
"when I say ""dampen"" I mean, the overshoots get less and less.

Think if a pendulum swinging. It swings back and forth, overshooting the middle (""equilibrium point"") by a little less each time, until it finds equilibrium when it comes to rest.

The same will happen. Markets are inherently self correction. A point will be found where mining profitability is more or less stable for both chains. Until a material event happens to one or both chains, of course. But those are tough to predict."
They won't get tired so long as there is profit.

Not that odd. You'd expect it more than once per day even if another coin with the same mining algorithm hadn't just become 3x as profitable to mine.

"On the contrary. I care about the technology much more than my profits, especially that I don't hold that much bitcoins of any kind.

I believe that the natural death of the legacy chain will prove us once and for all that the increase in block size is what the market wanted and needed."
Why do you think it's dampened? It's possible miners get tired of switching but in a model where a fixed group simply mines the most profitable chain, I see no reason why it would dampen.

Next difficulty adjustment it will skyrocket and it will be more profitable to mine btc, everyone switches back and then BCC has s slow network for the next cycle.

"Difficulty will change (increase) often if most miners join. It might not be sustainable and might do harm to the BTC chain to switch. Depending on how miners estimate these risks, and how much BTC they hold, they might choose to stay on a currently less profitable chain because long term they believe it to be more profitable. 

In short: long term (days, weeks, months) profits are also part of the strategy, it is not only about current profitability. It does not have to be ideological to stay on a currently less profitable chain. "
Lower difficulty usually means lower price, not higher price, because it is cheaper to mine and more miners to dump. You can expect BCH $2500 BTC $3000 when hashrate of both networks is comparable, I don't think this is going to happen anytime soon.
"AT the rate of bcc block creation, the difficulty will readjust again in about 4 days, so they dont have too long to act.

Fuck Core.
The beginning of the end for Blockstream's settlement system.
When is the next difficulty adjustment?
I'm confused. Do I switch to investing in BCH or stick with BTC?
Probably not  a very smart question, but I'm not too tech savvy, but a miner. It still isn't profitable to mine BCC with CPU/GPU, right? You'd still rather use ASIC or mine altcoins and convert them, right? 
No wonder. Most of the blocks are not even the size of 1/1000 bitcoin's block. 
Can't wait!
Wow! Now BCC to the moon!
when will BCH difficulty adjusted UP ?????
Yay I wanna see some low fees! 
Won't lower mining difficulty in a volatile market....mean that the miners will mine more BCC, sell it right away, increase volatility even more and drive price down in a negative spiral?
Probably been asked a billion times and likely just begging for down votes but: How easy would it be for someone who wants to get started mining be? My very limited knowledge of bitcoin has me thinking its as simple as buying a mining rig and keep it running some form of software 24/7.

Up from $300 a few days ago.
Back to the moon from somewhere outside the moon's orbit.
How is it not? Have you seen it these past couple of days? What did you think it was rising for? It was rising for this because we expected it to happen.
Damped oscillation.
Why would it stabilize? As long as Bcore is alive miners may jump back and forth to the most profitable chain.
When the difficulty readjusts (in about 4 days), it will likely be significantly *higher* than it was yesterday. The block rate appears to be about one every 3 minutes right now. 
True but at this rate 100 blocks is going to go by in a little over an hour instead of the normal 16
Some of us are in it for the longer run
At this rate it is $7.2M per day.
Thing here is that BCH can adjust diff downwards quickly. BTC cant. So if too many jump ship and BTC blocks stop being mined, it'll slowly start crippling BTC. Do this a few times and as BCH shows its resiliency and BTC starts stagnating when miners leave, a winner will be finalized

I'd almost consider the miners hostile if they allowed the difficulty to drop after the 500% increase. The next adjustment will properly set the block times to the 10 minute average as it was designed to be. That 10 minute time is based on an assumed constant or growing hashpower and to manipulate it would be devious.
[deleted]
Don't make the same mistake everybody makes of confusing an increase with a multiplication. 4x is 300% increase, just like 1.5x is 50% increase.
There's a meeting up in BC soon, or did I miss it?
Sweet! We might get some relief from these high BCH prices so I can buy some more BCHs!
thanks!
I just don't get the celebration....I'm starting to think that people here believe that miners print USD everytime they solve cryptographic puzzles...
Lots of anger towards a group of people that give you their work for free and can't force anyone to run their code. 
"It leads again to a more profitable bitcoin cash.

The system will come to equilibrium eventually."
Isn't there a maximum by which the difficulty can be adjusted upwards or downwards? Or no?
"Indeed,

It might go to implement a per-block difficulty adjustment with the next HF smooth out the difficulty swings..

"
Wut? Another hard fork?
They should have made the EDA shrink in size after each cycle. Too late now, I guess.
BCH's mining difficulty just dropped _significantly_. It's now 170% more profitable to mine BCH than it is to mine BTC, barring transaction fees, though someone mentioned that most pools don't distribute the tx fees among the miners, only the block reward
"BCH mining difficulty keeps dropping, making it more profitable to mine than Bitcoin. 

And yet the mining power isn't switching over en masse like BCH pumpers expect, hence why the difficulty keeps dropping. 

That doesn't stop them from celebrating all the non-existant miners that are switching over to BCH. "
yeah when do the fireworks and marching bands start? Its getting late here. 
A lot of people saw this coming.  Which explains the run from 300 to 700+ over the last 72 hours.  
However if the books are thin you can actually loose on mining bcc Because if you can't sell those BCC for the stable price but a weighted to the bottom (say $300) it doesn't make sense. So miners won't massively come until price stabilises.
Seriously? How uncommon is that generally?
Sounds like exactly what they were hoping for...congrats?...
It would seem to me that it is more about credibility and proving the changes.  I for one, look forward to seeing how the network performs with more load on it. I think the benefits of removing RBF are understated. Mostly I look forward to segwit activation and seeing how the two networks compete over time. Speculators gonna speculate, but what we are learning analyzing this revolutionary technology in the wild is about much more than the money
"> If I buy 50 $ worth, could that be 500$ in two years?

Maybe. There are a lot of other coins that can go up in price like that as well."
"It's the same because exchanges also need lots of liquidity to handle their day to day and only go to the cold storage when that liquidity is low.

A hub would act very similarly, perhaps with a different ratio of liquidity/reserves but the principle would be the same. "
If you had BTC on Aug 1st, you now have both.  I recommend holding both, until sufficient wallets, exchanges, and merchant services are set up for BCH, to make it as usable as BTC.
Correct.
how much hashrate?
not hard to be faster than a coin that isn't released yet
"Are you saying that most bitcoin cash blocks are less than 1KB in size? Because they are not.

When that fictional 90% of hashing power that BCH pumpers keep talking about finally switches over. 
About 3.5 days, according to [http://fork.lol/pow/retarget!](http://fork.lol/pow/retarget)
"Higher difficulty will mean fewer miners mining, but more miners selling previously mined BCH to realize profit while hyped up crypto demand is there still there? Meaning price will drop.

I was recently at a dinner party. People who had no clue about investing talked about investing in BCT/BCH. The last time I experienced that (inexperienced people talking about investing in obscure things like it's a money machine) was in 2008/2009 right before the bubble burst."
Depends on how fast the 2016 blocks are mined. See http://fork.lol/pow/retarget
It wouldn't (shouldn't) be an awful lot of work for them to incorporate BCC if they've already got BTC running, but yes they'd have to launch a separate node and implement BCC separately.
Mining rigs, as in home PC with some graphics cards, was viable before 2014.  Today you need to buy custom hardware, which generally goes to mining farms (big professional miners) first.  The custom hardware isn't cheap.

"**Bloom filter: Algorithm description**

An empty Bloom filter is a bit array of m bits, all set to 0. There must also be k different hash functions defined, each of which maps or hashes some set element to one of the m array positions, generating a uniform random distribution. Typically, k is a constant, much smaller than m, which is proportional to the number of elements to be added; the precise choice of k and the constant of proportionality of m are determined by the intended false positive rate of the filter. To add an element, feed it to each of the k hash functions to get k array positions.

"It's generally considered bad form to ask someone's thoughts about an article without linking to it. Are you talking about [this article](https://www.coindesk.com/spv-support-billion-bitcoin-users-sizing-scaling-claim/) on scaling SPV to a billion users? That article is based on the premise that you need to read the block from disk once for every SPV client that wants to filter the block for transactions matching his addresses, which concludes that bandwidth is the critical property rather than storage. That assumption is false in several ways.

For one thing, you can cache part of the blockchain in RAM. Different nodes could advertise different parts of the blockchain that they have stored in RAM, and SPV nodes could connect to multiple servers and get their filtered blocks from them in parallel. It would even be possible to have a front-end node that receives requests from SPV wallets and then dispatches them to a cluster of back-end servers based on which block they depend upon.

Secondly, you can index the blockchain by address upon download, so that when an SPV wallet queries you for transactions matching a certain address or addresses, you can just read your address:transaction map database instead of the blockchain. This is the approach currently taken by the Bitpay/Copay wallet server and Electrum, IIRC.

Thirdly, you can serve multiple SPV wallets with the same disk read. Ultimately, the SPV block filtering process is checking an address's hash against a bloom filter. For this process, you take an address, hash it in [a special way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter#Algorithm_description) to produce a bitstring that is mostly zeros, then AND it against a bloom filter that is also a bitstring that is mostly zeros. If all of the ones from the transaction's bloom hash match the ones in the bloom filter, then the transaction is a match and you send it to the client. Almost all of the work there is in reading the transaction from disk, extracting the addresses, and computing the bloom hash of the transaction; very little computation is done in the bitwise AND against the bloom filter. It would make a lot of sense to compare against several different bloom filters at the same time. A full node could do batch processing of SPV requests, and could process around 100 bloom filters or more on a single block with a single CPU core in the same time as it takes to do 1 bloom filter, or 10,000+ bloom filters on a single block with a single GPU in the same amount of time.

So no, it doesn't require sophisticated hard drive management. It just requires not being dumb about your algorithm, and making a few straightforward optimizations as you scale the system to 1 billion users."
"OK I agree with your calculations. 

After reading Jameson Lopp article my takeaway was price per GB is not independent of block size. If block size was 8GB then you'd increase cost through needing sophisticated hard drive management. Your thoughts? "

"SSDs are overkill for storing the actual blocks. SSDs are useful for storing the UTXO database, but that's about 1/20th the size of the full blockchain. But whatever.

SSDs currently cost around $300 per TB, or $0.30 per GB. Repeating the calc with $0.30/GB gives around 0.3 cents per transaction for storage costs, so his 1 cent per transaction figure is still accurate within rounding error.

Given that you can get a 3 TB HDD for $60 nowadays, you could also argue that $0.02/GB is more accurate. Ultimately, pruning means that the calculation is inherently inaccurate, as only the storage costs for the UTXO database matter.

> My question being 5 cents per GB holds up today for what size blocks? 2MB? 8MB?

Price per GB is independent of block size. (More accurately, price per GB asymptotes at the stated figures as block size increases. If you're only using 1 byte of storage, that byte will be very expensive due to the lack of economies of scale. However, even with 1 MB blocks, we have a blockchain of around 200 GB, which is enough to get close to that asymptote.)"
"VPS servers and SSD drives cost more than 5 cents per GB. 

I'm not sure 5 cents per GB using a HDD scales when you cross a single hard disk drive. 

My question being 5 cents per GB holds up today for what size blocks? 2MB? 8MB?


"
Problem is sending the block to 8 peers.
"That should have been 4 cents per GB of storage. This was an error in the description, but not in the formula. The storage costs amount to only 

    .04*250/1000000000. * 45750. = 0.0004575

or around 0.05 cents ($0.0005) cumulative over all full nodes. And that's assuming that none of those full nodes prune. In other words, storage costs are insignificant compared to bandwidth costs using OP's assumptions, as they comprise around 4.6% of the total cost of running a node without pruning."

"> Bitcoin forks and we seem an INCREASE in value while drama increased ten fold. 

There was an unsolved problem that kept the value down.  There are now two different scaling solutions, and the odds of at least one of them solving the problem is good.  One would expect that solving problems would increase the value."
I love you.
I disagree some what. I believe that difficult adjustments that satoshi set forth are just as important as scarcity to keep the network together. We should have tried harder to push larger blocks through with better politics. This opens the door to other contentious forks in the future. I do have a boner for how much this disrupts shitstream/corea though.
Thanks!
My man. Godspeed.
I'm not related to bitpay anymore, but this has been their stance forever.
That's my point exactly. Difficulty is what keeps the network together during contention. Changing difficulty is cheating satoshi's vision just as much as locking in 10k blocks.

"Only because of the 2 way replay protection implemented by Bitcoin Cash. Without that, things would've been a lot messier; and by the looks of it, there will be no replay protection neither on SegWit2x nor on SegWit.

That and Bitcoin Cash's EDA ensured a much cleaner fork."
"The relevant measurement is accumulated difficulty. Even when Bitcoin Cash reaches the same block count, and even same difficulty, there will still be a little time where the SegWit chain will still be more secure according to the official measurement (even if that chain is no longer usable by then). 

If we wanna respect the white paper, we should not claim victory until accumulated difficulty is higher than the SegWit chain (victory might be guaranteed way before that, but while guaranteed, it will still take some time to actually happen according to the numbers)."
"> What will you do when 8 MB blocks are full?

Change the default values for the clients over time to increase, then mine them when they become necessary.

> Hardfork to 16? What if some don't want to?

That's like asking what if Republicans wanted to own slaves, despite being founded as an anti-slavery party.

If you don't want large blocks, you stay on Bitcoin.  The people who left were people who wanted to scale through larger blocks.  Since we've separated out the people who want small blocks, it's not particularly hard to get consensus for increases if needed."
"EDA was necessary to ensure the chain wouldn't tank; and it provides a benefit in the war of attrition as hashpower come and go."
It's not a bug, it's a feature.  We have a difficulty adjustment in an hour, and that code will no longer be necessary.
"I think it's listed on their website. 0% fees for small merchants up to $10k per year, 1% fees for larger merchants that process more per year. I don't see this as a bad policy, small merchants get hammered with credit card fees so it's a good incentive to consider taking Bitcoin.

The thing is back when the agreement was offered, the only alternative was letting Core win.
"Based on my (admittedly very limited) personal experience, I'm 50/50 on whether they can be trusted or not; I haven't used them much so far, but 3 attempts got refunded minus transfer fees for no apparent reason (waiting for the response from the tech support right now), and 2 worked just fine (and the very first time I used them it also got refunded but this one was because I didn't have everything ready before I started the process and when I finally figured everything out and sent the transaction it was a bit too late and the time ran out before the transaction reached them)."
Nothing wrong but the volume is highly limited and fees are very high.
Didn't they sign the NYA? So where is the fuss?
