After the activation any non-segwit node will see the segwit anyone-can-spend opcodes as valid.  It will accept those transactions.  It will also see that they are non-standard and will not be able to relay them.  If it tries it is forked off the network.  This is why it requires 95% to activate segwit.  All non-segwit nodes are unable to relay transactions.  You become nothing but a zombie node.  Basically just a SPV wallet with a full blockchain and transactions it accepts as valid but doesn't understand.
