You can say the same about fiat to bitcoin but it's happening. Switching from myspace to facebook has as cost but very little which is why the transition was rapid. It is harder for it to happen to bitcoin but it still can happen. The first movers will make much more than the laggards in the case of crypto. If it's happening, the early movers to altcoins have profited much more than holding bitcoin just like the early investors of bitcoin.
