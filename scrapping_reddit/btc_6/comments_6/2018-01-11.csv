"Well, a lot of first adopters are in it for the long haul, and they don't have an inconsiderable volume as it was easier to mine it back then. I am a little concerned with people who don't have a good knowledge of crypto and shout for government intervention or regulations to solve problems when cryptocurrency came into existence because centrally managed currencies have issues.

Back again to your point: Even if there's someone who's been into bitcoin a very long time, they may actually have no strategy involved in terms of buying and selling at a given price and are instead looking at it for the utility value of doing their business in the crypto. I believe a day will come when crypto is the predominant means of exchange. 

Learn about the technology first, and from there it's much easier, I hope."

Universal Basic Income is the concept that everyone should get a base pay, thus equalizing the playing field. [SwiftDemand](https://www.swiftdemand.com/?referred_by=sgibson12) is a digital currency based on this, giving everyone 100 swifts a day. It's not yet on any exchanges so its value is determined by whatever people decide is fair when trading. As it continues to gain tangible value it will hopefully be beneficial for all, including the disadvantaged.

Short poem"
Am I late to the party? :(
"It’s not even dependent on miners. ANYONE can spend multiple times before block confirmation with or without miner collusion. Bitcoin required confirmation when its fees were 0. 

You are spreading misinformation. Give it up. "
the specific transaction i spoke of before i let bread wallet on ios select the appropriate fee for me, and it chose that .000249btc one.
The expense for mining isn't the block size it is the difficulty algorithm.
They may fit specific niches, but aren't needed as replacement for p2p
"Yes but that's not what we're talking about here.

If 25 people buy a coffee and the merchant uses only one address then waits for those 25 purchases before moving it that's not 50 transaction rather it's 26 (25 to the address and 1 from when merchant sends the Bitcoin to an exchange).

Which also means if the merchant has an address with funds already in it that they were already going to spend then a client sending Bitcoin to that address doesn't mean that when withdrawing those Bitcoin from that address that there are two inputs rather there's one input out of the merchants address because both pervious transactions were consolidated under one address. "
"well, that's what i mean; centralizing."
Especially, counting that full node mines. I suggest to drop Blockstream narrative and tell people why they don't have to donwload the whole blockchain to use Bitcoin (non-mining nodes do almost nothing on top of that)
Temporary?
">We will scale blocks as long as needed or until viable second layer solutions are fully adopted

yeah just increase the blocks and wait for bcore to work up the second layer solution and then port it to bcash"
"""Bitcoin itself cannot scale to have every single financial transaction in the world be broadcast to everyone and included in the block chain.""

But it seems you know more about this stuff than Hal Finney, a well known computer scientist."
"Miners don't charge that; you're being forced to pay by the system the Core developers put in place."
You're already several levels of abstraction too far. Less than 50% of the population uses a smartphone. That's 1st world numbers.
My debit card was denied when I tried to buy a new computer, you must know someone always pays the fee, why the f*** would you want to put coffee buying spamtransaction on blockchain? There is cash for that!
"RemindMe! 2 days ""Is the comic still an exaggeration?"""
"Yeah, it is EXACTLY what we are taking about...  Example was not ‘exaggerated’, it is a real world example, I chose not to move the bitcoin because it would’ve cost over $3000. It is basically stuck until fees go down.  Another transaction I sent weeks ago never confirmed and was at a reasonable level of sat/b.

I am not going out of my way to highlight ‘an unusual or extreme example’, this was from my node, with lots of tiny mining inputs.  Anyone with similar mining or faucet inputs would face the exact same fee issue.

If you are so lucky to have acquired your BTC with very few input transactions then that is a wonderful thing for you, many of us are not so lucky and are basically frozen with no choices.

BTC has blocks with more fees than coinbase reward (12.5 reward and 13.1 in fees?!) that is absurd, as is ANY fee in the thousands of dollars...

Just broken.

But that’s not my 2c... it’s locked up by core."
"Here's a good example:

*""got $50CAD worth of BTC for christmas, and had to use a $25CAD worth of transaction fees. then after the fee LocalBitcoin takes, im left with $2.60CAD. im done forever with bitcoin. long live Bitcoin Cash.""*

Quit complaining and design a better system that is instant. Think the washboard turned into a washing machine by itself?
Because you aren't changing the block time.
"> If 25 people buy a coffee and the merchant uses only one address then waits for those 25 purchases before moving it that's not 50 transaction rather it's 26 (25 to the address and 1 from when merchant sends the Bitcoin to an exchange).

Yes, it is 25 in, 1+ out, regardless of whether those 25 transactions are to the same address or not.

> there's one input out of the merchants address because both pervious transactions were consolidated under one address

Not unless there is a previous consolidation transaction. Two inputs are two inputs, it does not matter if they are to the same address.

If there was a previous transaction that consolidated these inputs, you have already paid the extra storage fee.

Take a trip to a block explorer and you will get the gist of it.

"The difference is miners watch each other; they verify each other's blocks are valid before building onto them because otherwise they risk wasting electricity mining on a chain that will be rejected by the other miners."

Whatever floats your boat. I'm into a functional p2p payment system.
then you should realize it's an economic disaster
That's how it's been advertised for most of its tx's. But sure there's all this dubious talk about how everybody is magically connected to everybody through hubs and nobody ever has to close channels because of bidirectionality ala CSV, blah, blah, blah. But no, the economics of this is bullshit afaic. 
"If that's the case, how many iterations do we have to go through until it's in a final usable state?  From what I can gather it seems like we are doing make shift changes to try and keep an old beater running (I like both BTC and BCH, not trying to put either down) instead of building it the way it needs to be built and then adding features on top of it. It must be clear to more people than just myself that this is actually holding back progress the way things are being done.  Another analogy would be like if they created the internet with 256 ip addresses when they already know the whole world needs it.  Why not just build it how it should be built rather than build it for the next 2 years just to find out oops not enough of whatever I gotta fork again. (Pardon the layman's terms, I'm no expert)

Is there no IETF (internet engineering task force) like group that can help facilitate debate and consensus?  Or are we too early in the stage and will have a cyrpto engineering task force kind of thing when the fortune 500 companies really start getting behind this thing?"
"ok, so back to my question: do you have any background in science, engineering, software development?

another thing: there's all this dubious talk about how the Bitcoin Cash network will have ever increasing block size up to terabyte's of blocks. Do you really think this is a good idea? In software development and engineering, scaling done by layering."
"The BIPs were an attempt at a IETF-like process.

The problem was that the community was expected to achieve ""consensus"" while simple scaling solutions are censored on major Bitcoin communication channels. 

Your IP example is a lot like IPv6. That has yet to reach wide deployment: despite 20 years and running out of IPv4 addresses. If we were not so wasteful with network addresses: IPv6 should be enough address space for a pan-galactic civilizations."
Who cares what my background is. What matters is if I understand LN or more importantly whether you do. Let me ask you this : how long have you been in Bitcoin? 
No, it's misunderstanding of Satoshi's invention - of Bitcoin security model
Is it a valid CS principle to KISS? How about to stick with what's working before changing it with a 95% code rewrite of 4500 new LOC?
"it is really important because technical decisions should not be made by non-technical people. many software projects have failed because management and users wanted quick solutions.

i'm asking this because i see a lot of people on this reddit making technical claims without knowing the impact of these decisions.

it's weird you don't understand why i ask for your technical background. having an opinion on bitcoin scaling is not the same as having an opinion about what your favorite song is.

I've been following Bitcoin and related tech for more than 2 years now. Don't see how that would matter actually because the technology is not hard to understand for anyone with a technical background."
"KISS implies that you can make a simple change without giving up on something else. in bitcoin terms: adding an ever increasing block size is making concessions on infrastructure. more bandwith required, more disk space, ...

also, as an example: instead of running your database on a more powerful machine you should first optimize your code where possible. in biticoin terms optimize the code but also make sure that users are using the network in efficient manner (segwit, batching, ...)

another example: instead of running your big monolith on a more powerful machine you refactor into layers and scale some parts and not whole application."
"I find it frustrating That I can't really get IPv6 VOIP: the poster-child of NAT mangling. Tunneling is not a good option due to latency.

I think the only easy way to get IPv6 VOIP is to get ""voice"" on a 4G cell network.

Edit: I think the problem is incumbent ISP have become addicted to up-selling ""static"" IPv4 addresses. So they refuse to activate IPv6. Comcast only upgraded when they ran out of Private IPv4 addresses for addressing their customers' modems."
It's not hard to understand without a technical background. In fact since you are technically a newbie in this area, I'm here to let you know that Bitcoin is an intersection between technology, mathematics, economics, sociology, psychology, and game theory. It was invented to solve monetary problems in the world and uses the brilliant never seen before intuitions of Satoshi that are not solely technically based but depend on financial incentives that most assuredly are not taught in CS schools. So don't try to give me your bullshit appeals to authority. And FYI, I've been in Bitcoin since Jan 2011 and have understood enough to get in and Hodl this movement way better than most of the geeks around here including you. 
">in bitcoin terms: adding an ever increasing block size is making concessions on infrastructure. more bandwith required, more disk space, ...

how do you know 1MB is THE magic number for blocksize?  what is the optimal blocksize today given we've had this same limit for 9y?  given that tech has undoubtedly advanced in those 9y, it must be now >1MB, right?  so what is it?

>also, as an example: instead of running your database on a more powerful machine you should first optimize your code where possible. 

why not extend what has been working the last 9y when avg blocksizes were well under the 1MB limit?  there are many tech estimates out there right now that say the network is more than capable of handling 20MB today.  why aren't we simply raising the limit to that?  who says that will lead to centralization?  Greg?  sorry, i don't trust him.

>(segwit, batching, ...)

how does segwit save on bandwidth when all the same amounts of info need to be transmitted, validated, and stored (if you want to maintain full capabilities of bootstrapping new nodes, which you should)?

>another example: instead of running your big monolith on a more powerful machine you refactor into layers and scale some parts and not whole application.

Bitcoin isn't some simple experimental tech project.  we're talking about real money being invested here.  you guys aren't the only one's to be making decisions:  many a tech project has been ruined by overly engineered projects by geeks who never understood the economics of the project let alone user needs.  what segwit and LN do is create a Rube Goldberg contraption that no one will want to use.  money doesn't work that way."
Ah.  If you control the whole/most of infrastructure that your call goes through, mangling (for qos?) is useful.  Not sure why u would really want it though if you're not talking about big infrastructure. But we digress.
"I was saying i don't want mangling. NAT traversal is so complex that my POTS to VOIP adapter includes a router: that you are supposed to put outside your real router.

I actually forward the SIP ports to my PBX box, and point the VOIP adapter to that. On most routers, you have to disable the SIP ALG feature for it to work properly.

My point was those are exactly the problems IPv6 was supposed to solve: yet most VOIP providers don't support it (except for cell phone providers that don't even mention they are using it).
"
"Gotcha.  Though I think you are a perfect example of why things are the way they are in IP-land.  There is a workaround (even for the little guy, and with more solutions than one actually) to get the job done.  It's even more impressive in an environment that is so heterogeneous in the hardware side which you alluded to.

Now... If only it was like that in the land of crypto."
"In crypto land, the work-around when the incumbents refuse to upgrade is to fork.

That apparently requires a certain critical mass though.

That was why Bitcoin Cash had 4 implementations on launch: 3 of them were previous failed fork attempts.
"
A little bit like IP, but not really.  It's compatible with the old addressing space (as in they can coexist and arguably both have their own purpose, internet vs lan), it's been widely used for quite some time.  As a network engineer ipv6 had been deployed in every situation where it's needed to be deployed. Part of the problem with the slow adoption to ipv6 was that it was so easy to still make things work with ipv4.  That's surely not the problem were are seeing here.  The only problem I see is the lack of open and constructive dialogue between very smart groups of people that want to advance crypto do that everyone can and want to use.  Without that there will never be consensus and the big companies will end up making it their own.
"Non mining nodes can't change anything and can't enforce anything.  
If you decide to not follow the miners then you just don't get new blocks.  
Non mining nodes = Expensive wallet.  
As business we run some nodes to verify transactions and make sure they're confirmed by miners.  
We host a lot altcoins as well and there you've often hardforks, often we realize that there was a mandatory update when we don't get new blocks anymore.  
In such cases we just update the node and it moves on again.  
The centralization is BS as well.  
The more demand the more miners and the more businesses joining the network.  
Worked for years that way till the nonsense 1MB cap was reached."
"When Bitcoin was first released, people did not even know if it would work. That is one reason decimal place was chosen such that there are ""only"" 21 Million coins issued. If Bitcoin ever gains world-wide adoption, moving the decimal place such that the are 21 Quadrillion coins (2 decimal places instead of 8) may make a lot more sense.

Similarly, conservative block-sizes have been chosen to prevent spam transactions from overwhelming a network mostly maintained by hobbyists. Part of the blocksize debate is over whether it is still important for hobbyists to be able to participate. As the network grows, the average node will become more and more professional.

Bitcoin solved a pair of unsolved computing science problems: cheating the CAP theorem (eventual consistency in event of partition), and resolving the byzantine generals problem. Essentially by requiring proof of work, Bitcoin is able to convert the Internet into an unjammable communications channel.

Satoshi always expected that network capacity can scale fast enough to handle VISA transaction levels."
apparently you're simplifying it into a payment channel between 2 persons.
"the idea is the network wants the number of nodes to be high, the higher the barrier of entry the less people will run nodes. thats the philosophical view why core is choosing to implement scaling solutions before increasing the block size.

edit: changed ""you"" to ""the network"""
"Only for propagation on the network. You still need to transmit all of the transactions separately.

Graphene also apparently requires some kind of canonical transaction ordering as well."
"Yes, eventually we'll literally have tabs in BCH. This is okay.

So I would get a credit card that I pay for in BCH, but only once a month. I get the convenience of being able to pay for an item online and cancel the payment if the merchant doesn't deliver. But also I get the ability to pay bills or transfer overseas instantly without having to pay for wires.

There are use cases for reversible transactions, and irreversible transactions. Credit cards are not going away, fiat is not going away, but neither is crypto."
"This will never happen either.  
Each transaction would mean each transaction on exchanges and all services.  "
Why not? Internet pipes grow bigger constantly and now some can watch UHD online
1 sat per byte, then per ten bytes...
If you don't have to compete with other transactions for blockspace, it's not a market.
"> I am not going out of my way to highlight ‘an unusual or extreme example’, this was from my node, with lots of tiny mining inputs. Anyone with similar mining or faucet inputs would face the exact same fee issue.

Actually that's fair and I hadn't thought of it that way. I was thinking of the hypothetical person from the comic who has a few dollars or a few hundred or few thousand or whatever on a wallet with a single address on his iphone or android or whatever, and wants to buy a coffee. Just because that person might be the the most common or easy to imagine, doesn't make it so for other transactions or situations. It really did seem like you were going out of your way to load up a transaction with hundreds of inputs just to make it seem even more overblown. 

People are upset and frustrated with tx fees and times. I get that and agree with that, it's antithetical to the whole point and spirit of bitcoin and satoshi's vision. But running a contentious fork, where the mining is literally controlled by 2 or at most 3 miners, the 'face' of the coin is serial con artist roger ver, and the bungled and seemingly purposeful insider deal on coinbase was super gross, doesn't sit that great with me either. 

Something about this subreddit feels off. It used to be a place where people who were tired of shadiness over at the other btc subreddit would share info and talk, now all anyone wants to do is shitpost, shit on btc and cheer about bch. I posted a relatively positive experience i've had recently with transaction speed and fees and people here start to flip out like I'm lying and need to prove it or that i'm 'a paid troll' or shill or something. 

Also can I ask approximately what was the amount of btc you were trying to transfer or consolidate where the fee totalled .2btc?"

"> you want the number of nodes to be high

Not at all. Number of non-mining nodes is irrelevant: 0 or 1 mln

> less people will run nodes

Running a full node is a part of overhead of being a miner. Majority of people will never become miners"
"I feel you, I've actually been lurking for years and finally just got involved, don't know why I open my mouth sometimes!  The amount of fee was a significant turnoff.  The tx had ~280 inputs...

With 280 inputs, at 180b per input + 34 bytes for a single output address +- 280b for signatures (variable) = ~50,600 bytes.

As I write this 500 sat/byte  will get one confirmation in 1-7 blocks (10-70 minutes).  So, the cost for this would be 25,300,000 sats / 0.253 BTC, which is $3,795 with a $15k bitcoin.

To put this in perspective, iirc some large majority of all wallets have a balances of .001 or less, so even if someone had 280 mining payouts of .001 (You'd be thinking 'YEAHHH! $15 for EACH of those payouts, I'm taking THAT to the bank) but nooooo...  That's only $4200 USD with the same $15k coin... Leaving our poor pool miner with only $405 of their $4200 if they actually want to cash out.

The lowest fees that are above a 360 block confirmation time are currently 300 sat/b, so that's only 40% less than above, and highly risky... you can't double spend what you don't double have.  :|

I'm not a huge BCH fanboy, but it does seem to be solving the problem NOW, and with the larger blocksize that was only reduced to 1MB some 8 years ago to prevent spam with the intention that it grow as necessary.

I don't know that guy, or any of the personalities, I'm just evaluating use and cost.  With no other discussion than an apples to apples comparison, the same transaction on BCH, which is running ~5 sat/b would run one 0.0028 BCH, or $8.40 with a $3k USD BCH value.

This translates to:
$3795 out of $4200 for BTC = 90.35% lost to fees
or
$8.4 out of $840 for BCH = 1% lost to fees

Sad state in general, and I know which one I would pick.

I am in the real world boat of situation A above, and hoping that something, really anything comes through and will reduce the fees, but otherwise we sit and wait on the stream to be unblocked."
what's so hard to understand about it?
"Why is it unknown may I ask? Should this not be sized and built correctly there first time like visa/mc.... at a minimum? Was everyday use never actually the intended purpose of crypto?

I'm genuinely asking.  Regardless of whatever coin.  As an engineer myself... I'm having trouble understanding why it was built in such a unscalable way in previous iterations and current iterations of Bitcoin and Bitcoin cash and whatever else is out there that can't scale for Global use."
"you might not, but I believe that is the network's general consensus

the nodes work in conjunction with miners though.

the nodes double check the miners work, and help facilitate transactions. 

and if it costs a million to become a miner, and only miners have the capability to run nodes, and together nodes and miners craft new transactions - how's that different from a centralized banking system?"
Cashier accepting BCH doesn't wait for a confirmation. Even exchanges won't do it in the future
"Thanks for taking the time to chat back and forth with me. I don't know what the 'right' answer is, and I hate to speak for you but it sounds like you dont either lol. And that's OK. At least I know for sure that a few of us talking and trying to figure it out is a positive thing. 

The point about a huge portion of wallets only holding 'minuscule' amounts of btc really is a bummer I hadn't thought deeply about. Essentially every one of those wallets that has .001 or less, even though that translates to ~$15, is almost unusable. I can't imagine a world where i had or found $15 in US dollars in my pocket or something, and couldn't spend any of it on lunch or even depositing it into my bank because of fees. 

I hope this is just part of the growing pains for btc but I really don't know. As an anecdote, I do remember getting into an argument/discussion with a friend in probably... late 2014 or 2015? And he was complaining about block size and transaction fees, that because of those things bitcoin was completely dead. And even though those problems haven't gotten fixed or solved, btc is still alive, and crypto in general is growing. If it can make it through the last 3 years since my buddy called it dead, I really hope it makes it thru the next 3-4 years and figure it out."
"I sympathize with anyone who spent their Christmas money buying into a hype cycle.  This story suggests that the Crypto community should be doing a lot more to publish accurate fee information.  The Bitcoin community already publishes more information than any other crypto-currency community including: help guides, charts, indexes, books, videos, journals, news sites... but the problem with hype is that people buy the hype without knowing the product.  

Crypto currencies are very cool right now. The hype is still there. How much do you know about the product?

Since you're interested in Bitcoin Cash, I'm going to give you some information about fees that applies to both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash.  Bitcoin Cash was created by forking the Bitcoin blockchain and codebase and still shares >95% of it's code.

Bitcoin is complicated.  To understand Bitcoin fees you really need to understand Bitcoin.  

* Transaction fees are not a flat price.  Users specify how much they are willing to spend to include a transaction in the blockchain.  Wallets make this easier by giving you options like **""fast"" or ""slow' confirmation**.  If you don't pay enough miners will ignore your transaction.  If you pay for ""slow"" confirmation, usually a low but reasonable amount, your transaction will be confirmed at some point in the future.   If you pay for ""fast"" confirmation your transaction will be included in the next block (10 minutes).  If you pay too much, you'll get a next block confirmation but you're wasting money.  You get to choose.
* Bitcoin fees are based on the **number of bytes** you want to transmit on the network and not the amount of money you want to send.   
* The byte size of a Bitcoin transaction is based on the number of **inputs** and **outputs**.   The more deposits you're drawing from or people you're paying with a single transaction, the more expensive that transaction will be. (https://www.cryptocompare.com/mining/guides/bitcoin-transaction-inputs-and-outputs/)
* Bitcoin Fees are calculated and paid in Bitcoin (Satoshi's are the smallest unit of value in Bitcoin) and not CAD or any other currency.  Miners that pick up your transaction don't care about the CAD value of Bitcoin unless they happen to be in Canada and the chances of that are low.

https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/  lets you see how much people are spending to send transactions on the Bitcoin network right now.  It fluctuates and has been getting more expensive on average for the last two years.

Wallets are still estimating fees, or people are just too used to having to specify a more substantial fee.  We can break them of that habit eventually and save them money.

"What? That's a problem with ""gatehub"" not BCH."
I believe LTC is faster because of differences in POW resulting in faster confirmation times but don't quote me on that. Litecoin get's plenty of usage and in my experience it has been consistently the best of the higher cap crypto's in terms of transaction speed and cost but yes it's basically the same tech so they all have the same problems.
go page through all the blocks and transactions on that day. They were nearly all around the same fee and nearly all took between 5 and 20 minutes. Block 497777 if you want to look through it be my guest.

You can't predict it.  I can tell you what fee I'll pay for a BCH transaction 6 months from now.  1-cent."
"Sometimes if you pay a high enough fee you might get lucky and get in the next block; the thing is, no one can tell what ""high enough"" will be, and so there often is other people guessing higher than you and you get pushed back on the queue, and that can happen enough times that your transaction might not get in a block till the next day or even many days later, or possibly it will stick around the mempool for about 2 weeks before it gets dropped completely without ever getting a single confirmation."
The good old days.
By the time the block reward ends, the volume of transactions will be so big that even if miners just charge a little just of the the bigger (in bytes) transactions to be included, there will still be enough total fee to pay their expenses. By allowing most transactions be free, they make the coin more valuable by encouraging people to use it.
"By that logic, when news reports that the Ford Pinto had a tendency to explode, people who weren't grease monkeys wouldn't have warned their friends & family about that flaw, and more people would have died in flaming wrecks.

"Legacy Bitcoin is an obscure fork aka ""The real Bitcoin"".

For some reason the core developers did not want to break compatibility with it, so invented a very convoluted ""scaling"" solution called segwit. Bitcoin-segwit essentially lies when talking to ""The Real Bitcoin"" nodes: pretending the blocks are 1MB; even if the witness data is up to 4MB.

Bitcoin Cash avoids that problem by doing a clean hard-fork. This allows Bitcoin Cash to take advantage of selected segwit improvements, namely the quadratic hashing fix, on *all* transactions.

Would have been funnier if he was holding the cup the whole time 
Because I was speaking from the experience of the last transaction I completed. And I guess for that specific block and the rest of the blocks on that day were all similar. Obviously there are some days or even weeks that have spiked longer times or tx fees. At the time i didn't research or do anything different literally just sent a transaction and let the wallet select the fee.

"> How's it multiple inputs if it's to the same transaction? 

This sentence makes no sense.

When a transaction output is spent, it has to be signed individually as an input to the next transaction. Even though they may be from the same ""address"". This results in a huge transaction with a high fee.

""Addresses"" and ""balances"" do not really exist, they are merely an abstraction. Only transactions, and their inputs and outputs, are ""real"".

Reusing the same address does not help."

Unless the seller receives many transactions to the same address. Then when the receiver sends a transaction they are combining all those transactions into only one input and output, combine that with a Segwit address giving the receiver a 40% discount on fees and the sender would only need to pay that $20 fee or so for an aggregate of potentially hundreds of transactions so no need to change the buyer twice. Obviously no one will buy an onchain  coffee with Bitcoin, they aren't supposed to but that's asides the point.

Damn, what a crazy story that got even crazier.   Hopefully you get your access to your coins, mate.
"Both theft and fraud (possibly wire fraud) would be plausible charges.

The thief had *access* to the wallet, but not *ownership* of the assets in it. Sort of like a joint bank account - say I setup a joint bank account with my friend Dave. If I deposit $1000 and he deposits $10, but then next week he withdraws all $1010 and stops answering the phone, he's committed theft. The fact that he had *access* to the funds doesn't automatically mean he had legal *ownership* of all funds in the account. This real-world case comes up periodically, especially when couples separate and one absconds with all the money from their joint account.

Fraud is even easier, because that's one of the crimes that is defined by your *intent* more so than your specific *actions*. It wouldn't be hard to convince a judge or jury here that the sellers *intention* was to trick the recipient into depositing the funds in a wallet the thief could steal the funds from.

Most scammers go to great lengths to make sure their real world identity can't be tied to their online activity, precisely because hitting them with theft and fraud would usually be a pretty simple matter, in addition in some cases to more exotic charges like say the computer fraud and abuse act, wire fraud, or money laundering."
Of course it’s a crime, the intent was to defraud! 
"Source? 

Making up things on the internet is easy though."
"This wouldn't amount to theft, at least not here in New Zealand.

Per the Crimes Act 1961, s 219(3), ""In this section, **taking** does not include obtaining ownership or possession of, or control over, any property with the consent of the person from whom it is obtained, whether or not consent is obtained by deception.""

Rather, this would fall under [s 240](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1961/0043/latest/DLM330275.html) - ""Obtaining by deception or causing loss by deception"".

Note under subsection 2(c), deception includes ""a fraudulent device, trick, or stratagem used with intent to deceive any person.""

The maximum punishment for both theft and obtaining by deception in NZ is 7 years' imprisonment for sums over $1000."

The new Bilderberg.
We can argue over what exactly the difference is if you'd like?
I'm sure it falls under some fraud statute, but you're right it's probably not technically theft.
OP purchased a physical wallet from a scammer on eBay. The manufacturer of the wallet has a 6 month back order. OP received his wallet but instructions had been falsified to include a key that the seller (scammer) also had. Scammer went so far as to produce a scratch off key document that would make it appear more legitimate. As opposed to the real instructions that tells you to auto-generate your own unique key. Once OP deposited his currency the scammer accessed the wallet with the duplicate key and removed the currency. 
It's definitely fraud.  He deliberately mislead OP with intent to steal from him.  Even if it's not a crime that's punishable by law (it is, but even if it isn't) OP can still sue him civilly for his money back.  There's not a judge on planet Earth who would hear this story, and look at the evidence (the fraudulent recovery sheet), and conclude that nothing wrong happened here.
"wait.... Everyone?  

""You should go flush my toilet in case there's an invisible poo.""  
""Well, I erm.... I'm not supposed to leave the store during my shift."""
The thief couldn't change the setup procedure of the device. And why would you do recovery during the setup? That doesn't make much sense and would be too suspicious. So instead the thief already set up the device and the recovery words were just there to make it more plausible that the device was already set up.
There is a special place in hell for all of us that are finding some humor in all of this while the OP twists and turns as his life's savings hangs in the balance.
[deleted]
Wow, that's quite evil to have planned this ahead.
"If OP has the recovery words, why does resetting the Ledger even matter?  I mean he could use a new Ledger device, enter the recovery words, and have access to those funds, right?

He doesn't need a second device if he has the recovery words for his current wallets either.  Just enter the old recovery words, move the funds to the new addresses, enter the new recovery words, and he's good to go."
Isn't it the same as the one on the scratchcard?
But if you have the device, and you can log-in on your device using your password to see the funds, can't you transmit funds?  If so you don't need the actual 24 word recovery seed, just send the funds out to any other wallet you control.  That should be done ASAP.  (I'm assuming when you received the device you set a password, correct?)
My Trezor required me to generate a random seed when I got it brand new out of the box. I realize that Ledger might be different but i don’t see how anyone would be able to trust a hardware device that had a pre-generated seed. My thoughts were that the thief moved the funds to another account. Can it be proven that they didn’t just move the funds?

"keep in mind this is difficult to prove: we're talking about my understanding of the sentiment of evolving definitions over time, but i'll give it a shot.

[here's a popular search result for what is a cryptocurrency](https://blockgeeks.com/guides/what-is-cryptocurrency/), which incorrectly states Bitcoin was the birth of cryptocurrencies:

> After seeing all the centralized attempts fail, Satoshi tried to build a digital cash system without a central entity. Like a Peer-to-Peer network for file sharing.  
This decision became the birth of cryptocurrency. 

but supports my argument that the public does not have the same understanding as the cypherfreaks.  In the early '90s, arguably when the term 'cryptocurrency' was first coined (pun intended), the [NSA refers to the technology as 'digital cash' or 'digital currency' rather than 'cryptocurrency'](http://digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu/aulr/vol46/iss4/6/).

as the strongest indicator, if you [look at the google internet trends for 'cryptocurrency' since 2004](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&q=cryptocurrency&hl=en-US&tz=Etc%2FGMT%2B5&tz=Etc%2FGMT%2B5), the term didn't gain ANY traction until around May 2016, and didn't become popular until late this year, eight years after Bitcoin was created, and _fifteen years_ after the NSA was publishing research on it.

I'm not making anything up, and this wasn't easy to dig."
No you need the seed to recover funds. It's not just the password. When you recover your cryptocurrency to another wallet, you need your seed. The person that currently has the password to the ledger, can just transfer the funds to another wallet that would have brand new seed and pay the fee though and that way they have a new seed and the scumbag can keep the old seed..... What is weird though is if he sent it back, how would he know if he reset the ledger and can't access the funds? That makes no sense. 
Or restore through Coinomi/the QT wallets and resend to the original. I wouldn't want to re-compromise the Ledger at this point.

The seed on the scam recovery card is different to the one that was preinstalled, as that seed is a seperate account. Other option of course is to also give the thief my recover card seed, but the problem with that is if I release that here on reddit everyone here in reddit will have access to it.
"As a recovering attorney-convict, I’d argue that my experience coincides perfectly with your understanding (but, of course Ole Blabber Mouth has something else to say).

Suppose, OP, in this situation were to feel that they had obtained sufficient redress, relief and/or justice, after confirming the return and exclusive access to their coin/tokens - meaning OP didn’t want the person prosecuted.   Maybe OP promised he wouldn’t.  But the state or the US gov’t refused to dismiss the charges against the alleged perpetrator/s.  

What could OP do to remain true to the promise?  First, get expert legal advice from the best and brightest that you know and then ask them who they think the best and brightest are.  Second, ALWAYS appear for court when summoned and/or subpoenaed, preferably with a skillful attorney by your side.  Third, OP must be exceptionally skillful to successfully remain true to the promise and avoid testifying should the defendant be arrested.  And the defendant must trust that OP will do as promised.  If the defendant disbelieves OP they’ll likely enter a guilty plea, more than 97% of US defendants do.

But imagine if the thief trusted OP, and OP honored the promise?  And all of this was originally set in motion, how?  By greed,  BUT second and possibly interesting to redditors, cryptographers and the technologically-inclined is that this saga occurs cyber ecosystem.  Distributed Ledger Technology’s development and success requires that we TRUST IT.  And this demand is oxymoronic in the face of it being developed by humans, who are invariably untrustworthy. And that is consistent with what I have read, which is that computer scientists developed this blockchain technology, in hopes of accelerating our micro-evolution towards factual accuracy and trust?

Having a legal education AND getting out of prison in Nov. ‘16 on a 7 year bid, I can appreciate the complexity of story, interests, and tensions.  For me, there is a beauty in it - It’s not only super fucking interesting, it’s poetically ironic!

Post Script: And to the alleged defendant, if you do go to prison, invoke the same energy, innovation and observation skills used to take from OP and hopefully those efforts will allow you to leave incarceration whole. 

Best wishes to everyone.  May 2018 be your best year yet.

Please, this is my first reddit post, so go easy. "
I don't understand why the recovery sheet was included at all then?  The exact same scam could have been done without it.  Wasn't the whole scam centered around a person entering the compromised recovery phrase during setup and the thief having access to that same seed?
Of course he does (if OP's story is true), otherwise he wouldn't be able to steal OP's funds in the first place.
The thief has the private key as he used in the first place to taken the coins out.
I tried that last night and it did not work.
Ledger is a cold storage wallet. A USB device you can store cryptocurrency. Someone sold a ledger on eBay, kept the backup phrase to recover wallet and stole bitcoins by recovering seed to another wallet. You can google cold storage and ledger nano S if that helps. Stay safe. 
"You'd have to trace the sourcing of the funds in the account - X amount was deposited by person A, Y deposited by person B, etc. It could be either massively complex or relatively simple, depending on how the people in question use the accounts. 

Taking ALL of the money in a joint account is a dead giveaway; you'd risk getting in some trouble for that. In a more subtle case, if you took say 75% thinking that was the amount that was yours, but a more detailed account reconciliation showed you only owed 73.4%, you probably wouldn't get charged criminally with theft, though the other account holder could demand your return the other 1.6% and/or sue you for that amount."
"By having the correct seed words (unknown to OP), the thief can recover to *a different ledger* device.  Then he can ""press the buttton"" (buttons).  He also could recover to a non-hardware wallet, where no buttons would need to be pressed at all."
"Idk man, this was a pretty sophisticated scam if it's real. It's a quasi-professional operation. The Ledger docs inside look real, down to the correct font. And the box was shrink-wrapped and resealed. 

Anyone can get hacked/scammed, and he was trying to do the right thing by getting the hardware wallet. No need to kick him while he's down."

I would think any digital currency using cryptographic hash could be called crypto-currency.  Ripple could be called a crypto-currency, but it is not a distributed one like BTC, BCH, ETH, LTC, etc.
but again, xrp isn't a cryptocurrency, it's just a digital currency 
Greenbacks
In theory they are working towards decentralization. I'm giving them a shot because I do believe private companies can be successful in this game. This is capitalism people! Did all of you forget???
Umm, the majority of the coins have been placed into escrow, and are not to be released (via smart contracts) until predefined metrics have been met. Please [do your own research](https://ripple.com/dev-blog/explanation-ripples-xrp-escrow/), and maybe not spread any rumors?
Ok so if you want to be that way fine but xrp is helping bitcoiners whether they like it or not. Coins like xrp that don't have this crazy psuedo libertarian following are making cryptocurrencies mainstream and trustworthy to we plebs.
So what makes a something a cryptocurrency?

"> than it is to any cryptocurrency

Yes that makes sense. On one of the docs OP posted with it it says about a default pin of 5555. 
Many thanks for your kind words, it means a lot. Yes I am still kicking myself for what happened.
Yes, it makes a lot more sense of the circumstances. I was sure that the cards sent out were probably identical but OP apparently had funds in the wallet for a while before they were transferred off where you would expect an instant sweep if all the wallets were identical.
I thought OP entered the words from the recovery card as part of the setup...  If that's the case, then why would it matter what seed was preinstalled?

That is possible, I know there was a completely scratch off one somewhere on the internet but I cannot find it, it would be good to compare to see if you are right.
Its theft against OP and fraud against Ledger.
"Yeah, that surprises some people.

A joint bank account is really just an instruction to the bank to allow either of you to make deposits and withdrawals to that account. Being on a joint bank account with someone doesn't determine legal ownership stakes of the assets the same way that say a joint real estate contract or joint auto purchase would.

> what's even the point of having a joint account then?

If you want someone else to be able to make deposits/withdrawals to that account. Obviously you would only maintain joint accounts with someone you trust, and as long as they don't abuse that trust and steal your money, it works great. In the small percentage of cases where one joint account holder does drain it in bad faith, they've committed a crime and you can report it to police and/or sue them."
"Apparently not, if you believe OP.

Actually it makes some sense: probably all the seed cards he sent out are identical? They are cheaper to make that way."
I'm not sure that returning the coins will prevent this person from going to jail. 
"Read OP:

> the seed on this recovery card is not the same seed that was preinstalled on my Ledger when I purchased it"
"got me! I would argue when anyone says ""cryptocurrency"" they imply ""decentralized cryptocurrency"".  Bitcoin was the first decentralized cryptocurrency, and most coins listed on coinmarketcap, discussed in the news, asked about by your friends, etc. are derivatives of bitcoin, i.e. a decentralized cryptocurrency.

Ripple is not a bitcoin descendant.  it's very rare to find a discussion about cryptocurrencies that _does not_ imply decentralized context.

but, you're right, the portmanteau ""cryptocurrency"" has existed before 2009."
"cryptocurrencies are digital tokens that use a decentralized blockchain.  simply put, ripple doesn't use a decentralized blockchain. because of this, they forfeit benefits of decentralized governance.  Ripple _is_ the XRP governance structure.

- 100% premine (everything owned by Ripple)
- coins are not mine-able
- centralized authority
- escrow lock on supply to control price (the Fed of XRP)
- Ripple _must_ own 61%+ coins to back value

XRP is much closer to the dollar than it is to any cryptocurrency."
"> holder does drain it in bad faith

How do you even determine that objectively?"

It will almost certainly shift the odds in their favor: less motivated police, less motivated victim, and even if caught, much more lenient sentencing.

"> The person that currently has the password to the ledger, can just transfer the funds to another wallet that would have brand new seed

That was kind of my point.  I have a Trezor, not a Ledger, but I have never needed to use my recovery seed.  As long as you have the actual device and your password, you can log-in and send funds anywhere.  The recovery seed would only be needed if I wanted to recover my wallet on a new device.  I guess my point is, if he has his password, and can log-in to his ledger and see the funds there in his wallet, why can't he just use his password and transfer all of his funds to a totally new wallet (a wallet outside control of the scammer)?"

I suspect all the recovery cards the thief sent out are identical, so that wouldn't be a good idea.
I’m really sorry to hear about this. I have a lot of my life savings in crypto and I’d be devastated if I lost any amount. I’m just curious about the preinstalled recovery seed you mention. My Trezor required me to generate the initial seed. There was no preinstalled seed otherwise how would we trust Trezor? I’m making a big assumption because I don’t own a Ledger but I’d imagine they would do the same... no? I’ve been thinking about getting a Ledger myself as a second hardware wallet but there’s no way in hell that I’d buy one if it has a preinstalled seed. Are you sure you got that part right? 
"good answer

I suppose that all of us should ignore everything in the box and go to the website and download instructions ourselves."

Heck, you could probably just compare 2 random seed words and see if there is a match.

"It is absolutely theft.  If a locksmith sells you a lock, but keeps a key for himself, then later uses that key to enter your home and take your stuff, it's not a credible defense for him to say ""I didn't break in, I had a key!"".  That technicality doesn't matter at all.  The fraudulent recovery slip is all the proof that would be needed to show that there was an intent to defraud OP."

"The term cryptocurrency is fairly new and doesn't really have a very strict definition. The term was never used in the whitepaper and it was never used by the authors of many much older currency systems similar to Bitcoin, such as Wei Dai (b-money 1998) or DigiCash (David Chaum 1989). It seems to be a term that appeared sometime after Satoshi disappeared.

Chip and PIN credit cards make use of cryptography, SWIFT transfers use cryptography, and as mentioned PayPal requires you to use cryptography (negotiate a TLS session) in order to send funds. Indeed, even the founders of PayPal claim that a Bitcoin-style system was their original goal, before they got bogged down with regulatory issues.

Limiting the definition of cryptocurrency to a currency that only uses cryptographic signatures to transfer funds seems wrong. Bitcoin can be transferred off-chain from one Coinbase account to another without the use of a digital signature, does that mean Bitcoin isn't a cryptocurrency?

Probably the best definition is a currency that is better than traditional currencies and traditional money transfer systems in some way due to its use of cryptography."

**If I were**
but it is? 
The plot thickens. 
I don't think returning stolen property protects from prosecution and I'm pretty sure that typically criminal prosecution is up to the legal system not the victim. It can certainly make things better for them though.
Doubt the thief has the private key. I think that money has been lost now. 
Maybe it's another thief who wants to steal from the thief. Or it's the thief himself so later he can say he's been tricked.
He probably did it with his actual ebay account tied to his real name.
Or maybe the thief new you couldn't access the wallet...
This might help. https://iancoleman.io/bip39 otherwise I just don't understand the problem you are having.

It would suck to learn that the address was gone and the funds they tried to return might as well be on the other side of the universe. 
Don't you have to physically press a button on the ledger to sign and confirm transactions? Isn't that the whole point of ledger? I understand the fake recovery seed words but how would he finalize the theft without having the ability to press the button?
I don't get what happened?
"Am I reading this right? 

Recovery phrase A was pre-installed on ledger

Recovery phrase B was on the scam card

Recovery phrase C is what's on the ledger now

Previously, OP led us to believe he was using the ledger under recovery phrase B (scam phrase), but he was actually using it simply under ""A"", and ""B"" doesn't work? furthermore, he didn't save off ""A"" (or the private keys associated) for future proof that he was the owner of those keys/assets at some point?!

OP has B and C
whoever sold him the device probably has B
whoever took the funds has A and *might even be a separate scammer*?! (though probably not).

Please, please, /u/moodyrocket consult with some people you trust in the bitcoin community before you make any -- *any* more moves."
Damn this is a story I've been somewhat following but seems to have taken a twist. I commend the thief for trying to make things right but fear it was only due to fear of being arrested. Anyhow good luck to you OP I hope it all works out for you. I had a sort of similiar scary experience myself so I can kind of feel what you're going thru.
Why is it not a crypto currency? I have invested in hundreds of them with a bit of my insane BTC gains. I know a lot about Bitcoin but little about Ripple except that banks are signing up. Educate me please? 
If I'm buying a Ledger for the first time, it's probable that I'm unaware of that 
"It has to use a consensus algorithm. POW is just the first one proven to work well. 

Also it's not a stretch. The point of a block is to conceptualize a discrete update step. It doesn't really matter if 100 or 1 or even 0 transactions go in a block. BCH had some zero transaction blocks after fork."

I'm halfway of being very happy for you. 
Plot twist, thief cannot help op retrieve funds. Merry cluster of fuck to all.
If he returned the funds to your ledger, you actually don't need the real 24 word recovery seed to access the funds.  You need only your password.  I'm assuming when you received this ledger you created a password, correct?  If so, then just use your password to transmit the funds from your ledger to any other wallet.  Just get it off of that ledger quickly.  The real recovery seed you would not need unless you lost the actual ledger and wanted to recover the wallet on a new device.
If you have the old recovery words, then you should be able to access all the funds he sent back to you.  You can restore the Ledger to the previous state by using those recovery words.  I wouldn't wait for the thief to change his mind here, I would grab those funds immediately and move them to your new Ledger addresses.
"Ok smart guy, then how would you describe it.

Wow your reply is *so* helpful
Please leave your agenda outside.
The thief has good reason to believe that OP had reset the Ledger. So thief sends the funds back, waits a while, and then claims OP has taken the funds back while thief moves the funds away?
"My guess: He realized that he probably didn't have as perfect opsec as he thought (or, worse for him, *didn't* even think about), and would thus likely get caught and have a less than pleasant future in front of him. I helpfully provided a long (but still incomplete) list of ways that could get him caught in the previous thread, maybe he found it and realized he made a mistake somewhere :)

Returning the money before getting caught increases the probability that people (the victim, police) lose interest and either stop looking for him, or at least spend less effort, increasing the chance that he gets away, without the loot, but also without jail time and without getting the shit beaten out of him (either by a victim or some random guy who thinks he has a lot of coins).

Even if police continue looking and he gets caught, such a change of mind is tremendously helpful when it comes to sentencing, and may be the difference between a slap on the wrist and serious time.

Maybe he's also just a somewhat decent person and only now truly realized that he's not just pushing buttons and making money appear from the Internet, but actually affecting other real people."
It’s not about the money. It’s about sending a message.

"I'm genuinely curious as to what would actually happen to this ""thief"" so to speak. Theoretically he didn't steal the coins as OP sent them to an address that was compromised. The thief's intent was to steal, but did he actually commit a crime other than deceiving OP. I'm not defending this guy in any way, but from a legal standpoint I wonder if he actually committed a crime. Maybe fraud, but the way cryptocurrencies work I wonder if it actually is fraud."
I don't get what happened?
I wonder if the thief was selling these wholesale to resellers on eBay.  The thief doesn't need to sell the devices, he just needs them to end up in the hands of consumers somehow.  Hell, he could give them out for free and probably turn a huge profit.
"I bet if it's being resolved this quickly he did this all through an ebay account linked to his real identity. Very stupid.

At least set up a shell company and ""buy"" them from there so you have some plausible deniability..."
You can also reset ledger. I'm paranoid and bought direct from them and I just set and reset. Like when I go to the bathroom, I flush the toilet just in case there's an invisible poo?! And I tell everyone I meet to do the same. You never know....  Lol
Without sheet and an already set up device, the user would wonder how they could ever do recovery and would get suspicious more easily. The thief couldn't change the firmware if the device so changing the setup procedure was never an option.

"I'm not sure if your clarifying something I said or correcting me? I don't think anyone was under the impression that SWIFT was a crypto but it is good to specify its really just a communication system to augment our traditional and slow systems for international transfers.


My point, and yours I think, was that Ripple solves the issue of delayed settlement that banks are currently forced to work with today. So when I say Ripple has a good chance of replacing SWIFT I mean not as a communication platform but rather as the system of moving large sums of money between institutions. My point, and yours I think, is that Ripple will make our traditional methods of international  money transfers obsolete."
"So... let's start with the first thing XRP = Ripple.

XRP is Ripple.  In order to transfer funds, banks MUST purchase XRP tokens. The XRP tokens transfer over the ripple ledger to make the transaction. Then the bank sells their XRP on the other side to their desired currency. Or they could simply keep the XRP if they wanted.

XRP is the same as bitcoin. It's just a distributed ledger.  It's like saying people don't need Bitcoin to transfer money. They can sell the bitcoin as soon as they get it in their wallet. No.... that sounds stupid, right? You had to buy the bitcoin first to transfer it. It doesn't matter if you sell it later.

The next thing : 100 Billion tokens were created out of thin air, ***unlike other cryptocurrencies***. HAH. Plenty of established coins were premined, and Bitcoins distribution method is simply different. It may be more ""fair"" but bitcoins are also created out of ""thin air"". No one cares that you wasted electricity in order to produce it. I just farted hot air out of my ass, does that mean you're willing to pay for it?

I agree centralized owners is not a good thing if they control a large part of the currency, but that's a separate issue.

The only argument against XRB I can think of is the possibility of a pre-computed POW attack (since there are no fees on txs). I'd like to hear of more cons if anyone can provide any.
"Yes, a lot. Here are some: 

Pre-mined, centralized (VERY!), one company controlling the supply and holding 2/3 of it and peoples XRP holdings can be seized/frozen. Also everytime XRP is transacted, a small amount of the supply is destroyed, so you (the user) actually indirectly pays for the deflation which benefits those with the biggest XRP holdings. 
It is a blockchain for banks - which is fine for what it is - a more efficient way to settle money transfers between banks, but that is it. It has nothing to do with being a decentralized and trustless currency like Bitcoin/Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum etc. 
"
"IMO, anything XRB can do BCH can do. Instant txs? We have 0-conf (as well as improvements coming). Does XRB have a distributed development team? Zero fees? I think I can still afford 0.005c per transaction using PoW that has been tested since 2009, not to mention this will also get lowered.

BCH also has a top notch community of merchants, and participants, with more being added all the time."
No. There are, however, major arguments against shoehorning it into irrelevant conversations like this. 
XRB or XRP?

> It's not really a ""point of view"" ANYONECANSPEND transactions are striclty valid from a protocol point of view, and do not require a signature.

Exactly, but they still have a signature that is not part of the chain anymore.

Solid trolling. 9/10 for effort. 
"> but conveniently forget one of the fundamental rules, which would make your idiocy discarded as an orphan branch.

It has been rejected by the Bitcoin Core miners which have the majority SHA256 hashpower.  
That's why Core was able to retain the Bitcoin name and BTC ticker.  
And this is why Bitcoin Cash is named differently and has a different ticker.

> In other words, Bitcoin has so much hashrate it could eat Buttcash for lunch without breaking a sweat.

If it was that easy it would have been done."
"> Bitcoin testnet also matches, still not Bitcoin

It is Bitcoin testnet. It's not the btest altcoin.

> If it's not in the chain it's not Bitcoin

Exactly, that is why for many Bitcoin Core is not really Bitcoin. SegWit created an altcoin because it removes the signatures from the blocks.

> So the DB bugfix is, according to your ad-hoc logic, more of a consensus change than the max blocksize is? Bitch please

You said every coin that hard forks has no claim to the Bitcoin name.  
I just told you that Bitcoin Core hard forked years ago and thus by your definition would not have a claim.

Nodding in agreement, shaking in despair. We’re achieving such a small fraction of what we’re capable of.
"Why do you think Bitcoin Cash is decentralised? What makes Bitcoin decentralised in your opinion?

Lightning is not a real scaling solution. It only allows you to preload Bitcoin with an entity you wish to purchase from often enough to bother preloading with. It still has security issues that prevent it from starting.

The only way Lightning could facilitate faster transactions is if there was large centralised payment hubs that people would have to pay subscription fees in order to use. They would act like banks and charge you bank fees essentially. The exact things Bitcoin was invented to prevent."

"> Why do you think Bitcoin Cash is decentralised?

Centralized you mean? It's under the control too much of Jihan Wu and a certain mod on this sub.

It's still early days yet for lightning.

8MB is not nearly enough to compete with Visa. It would have to be at least 100 times bigger than that. Which would then make it even less secure.

"
"You’re confusing ownership of actual Bitcoins with control of the Blockchain. 

And where’s your source for this anyway?  

Satoshi, beloved on this sub, owns a million Bitcoins. "
"Actually Bitcoin Cash has several development teams. There is scaling solutions being developed other than just increasing the block size of course. That said having raised it has caused absolutely no centralisation.

It seems the myth that larger blocks cause centralisation of the network is based on some basic misunderstandings of both how how the network works, and how much more difficult it is to run a node with larger blocks.

First of all non-mining nodes contribute nothing to decentralisation of the network. They are only for personal confirmation of the transmission of a transaction to the network. They are most useful to those accepting transactions.

Second it is well within the capability of very cheap machines to run a Bitcoin Cash node anyway. Even if there was no limit to the blocksize the size of a block can only be as large as the transactions transmitted to the network. Blocks are not just the max size every time. If they are then the max size needs to increase.

Now understanding the second part let's you know that it takes mass adoption of Bitcoin in order for the amount of requested transactions to get that high. With that increase in adoption you see that much increase in desire to mine, and or run a node. So even as the difficulty to do so would increase the amount doing so would also increase.

So even with 1GB blocks which would allow competing with VISA, which has been tested, it would still be a decentralised network."
"Bitcoin was intended to be decentralized above all. Bcash is compromised in this respect.

Lightning in any case will blow BCH's meagre block size increase out of the water.

"I agree that most medicine won't work (and many chemicals are dangerous to human body) and there's lots of snake oil sellers out there.

We are not very good about thinking risk aversion. We let people do way crazier shit than use ineffective medicine. Like go skydiving and die. Besides it should be that safe is enough. Effective would be extra. Phase 2+3 are super expensive.

Think about the people who suffer from PTSD. If its proven that taking some amounts of MDMA in therapeutic setting is safe, in worst case they have a bad experience and that is all. 

For example cluster headaches are the most painful diseases known to man. LSD (or its non-hallucinogenic variant) have stopped them in some people. Maybe it won't work but I think as soon it has been prove physiologically safe, I think people should be ""allowed"" to use it. If you ask me, I think all medicine should be just marked safe or effective by FDA. If you want to buy snake oil, by all means, do it. People can have different utility functions (and thus risk-aversion).

"The real problem is not only that things that work are not allowed (marijuana, mdma, etc.) but that institutions like the FDA are nothing but an extension of the drug companies. This is why in the USA a bottle of Vitamin C, for example, must say ""FDA disclaimer: This product not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease"" if the manufacturer tried to say something like ""Cures scurvy"".

The FDA process for getting a drug (which is by definition a patented molecule) approved is to have two double-blind, placebo controlled studies that show a positive effect. The studies are done by the drug company, not the FDA. If the company pays for 100 studies that show horrible effects and no health benefit, they can ignore them. They only need to provide the two good ones. The average cost to get a drug approved is many, many millions of dollars. The patent on the drug lasts 7 years (or 10, can't remember), and when it runs out, other companies can make generics. Often what happens then is the drug companies tweak the molecule slightly in a lab, go through the approval process again, and claim it is ""improved"". This means another income stream for the next decade.

Meanwhile, supplements, micro-nutrients, things like MDMA, marijuana, etc. (things that actually cure diseases) are ignored. There is no money in them, because they can't be patented. The supplement company also has no way to afford all the studies needed to go through the approval process, and even if they did, again, there would be no benefit to them. FDA board members are a select few and have a lot of final say. Often times they themselves are or were drug company chairman/higher ups.

Fun fact: ~85%+ of drugs are plant molecules that were tweaked in a lab. These molecules usually have no side effects and are as or more effective than the end result drug in the first place.

Fun Fact 2: A large percentage of drugs inhibit stomach acid production, which means the person taking them absorbs less nutrition while they are on it, furthering the underlying problem in many cases.

All it would take is the same simple labeling you see on medications now (careful while operating machinery or driving).  A person who barely uses this med should **not** attempt to drive after taking.  A person who uses regularly has a tolerance and understands how the med affects them, if at all. 

Worst part is I **look** drunk if I do not take my meds since my muscles seize randomly and make it incredibly difficult to walk/control limbs well

I would pass field sobriety test with flying colors while taking my medication.  I will **not** however even come close to passing a blood test due to my tolerance/dose level/multiple dose methods

Edit: And before you ""but Bitcoin Cash only gets such and such percentage of miners"" please realize that miners will milk BTC chain into the grave, because it's more profitable to THEM to maintain it in even an undead state, for maximum profit.

Miners will transition to BCH in majority, when BTC will be illiquid, and that is when it will be impossible to transact the mining rewards. Which is total death. Before that happens, miners will mine it, AND KEEP IT ALIVE AS LONG AS THEY CAN."

Also, Intel introduced a third cycle of CPU development, mainly because they know that once they hit the 5nm manufacturing process, they are pretty much screwed... They're just milking the cow the best they can, because are nowhere near to substitute the current  traditional CPUs..."
IT will do that exact thing this May - increase the blocksize cap to 32 MB and start implementing the framework for dynamic blocksize cap adjustments.
"When base pairs with altcoins are replaced with BCH (or even BCH pairs merely added), this is the time BTC has a real, honest ""oh shit"" moment.

Fireworks will follow."
"""truth is annoying""

Yes and I totally agree, we hit a wall recently, but I still think that qualitative, not quantitative, jump is coming. Maybe I'm wrong, but from what I've seen in life, when you least expect it, there comes something cheaper, and better, in regards to computing.
"Are you retarded ? They did.

Core WILL NEVER, EVER increase the blocksize cap.

If you do not know this, you haven't lurked enough.

Lurk moar."
"You can add to the list that there is already a Brazilian company using ""Bcash"" and ""B!cash""."
"Changing your own opinion is what you do when new evidence is presented and arguments are further laid out. Sometimes it just takes a bit of time or a single crucial point needs to be refuted for somebody to rethink something.

I won't get into a debate about BTC/BCH politics. It just doesn't matter all that much to me. As I said, there are sincere people on both sides of the argument, but some of the arguments require a deep understanding of the technology that 99% of users on either subreddit don't have. Just look at all the same old arguments being repeated by either side. People defend LN without understanding it, people defend big blocks without having understood the issues of latency (speed of light), the current p2p overlay network and CPU verification taking too long."
"> Less donations for them. People won't be sending BTC with high fees so let them learn the hard way.

But they will send with low LTC fees, checkmate."
"> Nobody is attacking Bitcoin except Core. It'll all play out on its own.

I think you might want put down your pink shades, many people are shitting on this coin."
