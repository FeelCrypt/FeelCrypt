"that's just human interaction, that's how it works, you're deciding your future communication based on whether each word i say here strokes or critiques, manipulating people's communication behavior with incentives is *the only point of reddit*, allowing people to send money just allows some of that stroking to take the form of personal profit vs how reddit would rather it all be spectacle and ""gold"" and people feeling vaguely rewarded or acknowledged in cheap ways while reddit actually gets the money"
As does the voting system on Reddit as a whole, as does the moderation system on r/Bitcoin.  At least dissenting comments can be seen on r/btc.
BCH is still up since the fork and if you moved when the ratio was good, you are up 2-4x.  It may not always be that way, but even with the crash, I am still smiling.
So now people can only laugh at themselves? If you cant tolerate joking you might consider spending BTC on therapy.
Dude a. Miatas are gay as aids. And b. It doesnt matter if its assembled in america that money still goes overseas to a foreign country.
Touche
I kept all the BCH I got after the fork, but haven't invested in any more. I'm looking to HODL past this crash, but if there's a better option I can take it.
Whoosh

"To be fair, the tipping behaviour of ""good comments"" in r/btc is actually blatant positive behavioural enforcement, through monetary reward; ultimately encouraging continued communication and reinforcement of a certain, and distinct, narrative. "
Some dealerships have probably had clients with bitcoin though, and at least one accepts it.
So it makes no sense in  pro-bch sub to laugh at BTC being down, when BCH is down even more.

"I wouldn't mind being in a nice Fiat these last 2 days or so...

At least I could sleep, legroom notwithstanding."
Yeah... Cars, watches, I don’t get it. 
Actually some high end cars can be an appreciating asset. 
They buy them because they’re rich and they can. Also on an open road super cars are incredible fun to drive. I don’t understand people that hoard super cars to leave them in a garage but my assumption is it’s because they can so they do. 
The other thing to keep in mind is the constant maintenance costs. Buying the lambo isn't the hurdle. Keeping it driving is.
its pretty funny how not insulting that comment is
I can tast the salt from here
Scam how? 
What am I missing? I was trying to imply that being parked in fiat USD would have meant a lot more sleep these past 2 days than cryptos
THE TIP. Not a tip. O ya. Well supercalifragilisticexpialidocious to you too. I know what necrophilia is. Its what happens after ive kill't the pussy. R.i.p debra.
"> That would have been a fine reply to make. But that's not what you wrote originally, and isn't what I responded too.

It's not what I wrote immediately, because I was replying to a comment above, that in turn was criticising a comment regarding ""tippr not being as innocent as you think"". 

Somebody responded to that, saying it deserved a dumbest comment award, and so I replied stating why I thought that part of the comment deserved more attention. 

The monetary aspect was the operand of the whole thing. "
Since you gave her a tip, I'll give you one: less weed, more reading. Then perhaps you can understand big words like necrophilia.
"Obviously, I left it out intentionally to make the structure of the argument even more incredibly clear.

(That much should also be clear from context.)

In any case, your argument now appears to be that the positive feedback of microtipping may be even more influential than the positive feedback of voting. 

(In theory, sure, but in reality, at quantities this small, not really or meaningfully.)

That would have been a fine reply to make. But that's not what you wrote originally, and isn't what I responded too."
You mean oppressed. I gave her the tip first. She said no but really meant yes.
"> I would say that the meager amounts that people tip encourage the same amount of group think that regular upvoting does.

perhaps this is true. My hunch would be that it is not equal at all. An upvote is not valued outside of Reddit. When BCH first came and tippr was reborn out i got tipped quite a lot (as everyone was going tipping mad). I cashed out those tips at pretty much at the ATH (minus the Coinbase crap). I did quite well. You still think its the same as +400 comment karma?"
"did you just paraphrase a quote from me to support your argument, leaving out the objective statement in the sentence?

if you were not responding to the monetary part (which i thought you would have considering it was the operand), then i am pretty sure this is where things got mixed up. 

> The idea is that the patterns of voting themselves are a form of ""positive reinforcement"" 

i agree

but this is not what i was getting at. I was saying that the monetary incentive used to reinforce behaviour is a far more nuanced and ultimately shady practice. you are free to agree or disagree with this if you like. "
So youre a repressed homosexual but an outspoken necrophiliac? Very interesting. 
I would say that the meager amounts that people tip encourage the same amount of group think that regular upvoting does.  No one tips in r/politics but that might be the largest most single minded subreddit on this site.
"There isn't. The original comment is: 

""To be fair, the tipping behaviour of ""good comments"" in r/btc is actually blatant positive behavioural enforcement...ultimately encouraging continued communication and reinforcement of a certain, and distinct, narrative.""

The response is clearly in reference to this, not the ""monetary compensation"" part.

The idea is that the patterns of voting themselves are a form of ""positive reinforcement"" that ends up ""ultimately encouraging continued communication and reinforcement of a certain, and distinct, narrative.""

That much should be clear from context."
And your moms butthole.
No, sales is a direct attempt to manipulate people into thinking they need or want something that they essentially don't, or to make them believe they want more than they actually want. It is not a direct behavioural reward mechanism.

"money is just a particularly fungible form of value, or conversely any particularly fungible form of value is money, karma is of course valuable it's just not very fungible (you have to sell the whole account), reddit pushes people towards stroking one another with less fungible value just to keep value inside their system so that *they* can extract it in the form of money

normal IRL social interaction doesn't use money not because no value is exchanged but because money is *more expensive* than using informal credit, but the social networks we can form using social media are much larger than how large an informal credit system we can keep in our heads, i recognize your username but i have no awareness of your standing in relation to all the other people on this sub, so money is useful because it's more abstract, you can give this credit to someone else without them having to know who i am as opposed to having to say ""/u/mungojelly can vouch for me that i'm a person worthy of credit/trust"" $0.25 /u/tippr  "

"Hey man. I have you set as a friend on Reddit and have you listed as someone smart and knowledgeable on EOS. So I can see you have some bias that would make you think like that. I see EOS and to ETH as ETH was to BTC, so I have the utmost respect for Vitalik and the ETH team, and I'm still invested in ETH as it's good to diversify.

I'm just disappointed that you hold these opinions, as you must be a smart guy. Maybe you're right and Vitalik is the best scam artist I've ever seen, but all I've ever seen from him is intellectual honesty and regular ol' honesty and politeness. Nobody is perfect, and according to my research, the resources you've provided seem to be mixed with non-arguments or very small nitpicky of where ETH/Vitalik got it wrong, but owned up to their mistakes.

A lot of those links are old and the issues have been fixed.

As for the DAO fiasco, I'm glad to have the debate, but I don't believe code can be the ultimate law when there is the possibility of unforseen consequences. After all, who would want to invest in something where all of their money can be gone because of an unforseen bug? I think there needs to be some permanent fix for this fundamental issue, but for now, ETH is in its early stages and I appreciate they forked. One investor said that's how he knew he made a sound investment. 

You could question what the rules should be for when to fork, but I think it's going back to the fundamental issue that rules cannot be hard and fast because any case can be completely different than the possible scenarios you've envisioned when creating the rules. This is why most judges rule based on the spirit of the law and not the letter of the law.

I envision the future of smart contracts to include a provision that states any party can opt for an agreed upon party / oracle (one person or most likely a group chosen by a system like Augur) to have the final say in settling the contract. Even if we're able to fix coding mistakes with proofs, being able to envision every edge case scenario for a rule / law is a bit further down the road.

Onto security: I'm not fully aware, but has there been a major security flaw in ETH's code? I'm not taking about dapps or third party code. Maybe you'd say ETH could have been coded better to prevent third party code from being vulnerable, but hindsight is 20/20, is there something you can point to that was really egregious / foolish?

As for centralization, it hasn't been a problem for any cryptocurrency yet, and if it happens, the community can and will fork to keep it decentralized. I feel like the bigger issue crypto solved was how to incentivize open source projects. As long as a project is open source, it can be picked up if a carrier falls down. 

 TBH, I skimmed the link that claimed to show ""no ""legitimate"" developer respects Vitalik, as a lot of them I know of as Bitcoin maximalists, or who I like to say belong to the cult of Bitcoin Core, which I know is a fallacy, but I don't want to waste my time either, so if you feel one is particularly insightful, feel free to link me to it. Also, saying ""no legitimate developer"" is like the no true Scotsman fallacy. Even some of those links had praise for Vitalik, such as Greg Maxwell saying he's kind and polite, but he felt he was naive (I feel like Vitalik proved him wrong in the end, but maybe you'd say ETH is still on course for a crash, I'm not going to argue), and the Cornell professor also saying he has respect for Vitalik. I mean, you also linked to a thread that said people don't respect the implementation of ETH, not Vitalik. The link to the Monero dev I found interesting, but /u/vbuterin responded with points that made sense to me here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/tech/comments/3wgcrz/the_ethereum_computer_securing_your_identity_and/cxwubpw/

/u/fluffyponyza made an excuse, and not saying his reason wasn't legitimate at that time, but unfortunately never replied, which I hate, because I feel like debate is the only way we can figure out tough questions. I just think many people don't know how to debate properly and end up talking in circles or past each other which makes it seem like no progress can be made.

I have an open mind about this, and I'm open to seeing your side, and I hope you feel the same.

I'm thoroughly against ""maximalists"" who treat any crypto as a religion where nothing about their favorite platform can be impugned. I've been researching enough that I know this space is way to complex to be arrogant enough to be sure of anything, so I'm always open to new ideas and criticisms,especially for the projects and people I like, which is why I find it disappointing that you have this tone and attitude like you're 100% right that Vitalik is a bad person.

I feel like if Vitalik, Dan, and /u/ethereumcharles (the leaders in the ""platform space"" imo) were to have a weekly discussion on Reddit, with community input on what questions should be asked going forward, the space would be a whole lot better and more progress would be made. What ends up happening is some form of debate is tried, there's a difference of opinion, and one person ends up leaving to try and prove their idea right. I guess it's an okay way to solve problems, but not an efficient one. If people had an open mind, they can all work together as a community and progress the field 1000x more quickly.

Looking forward to an open and honest reply, if you'd like."
"> The genius Core devs took the opcodes needed to do smart contracts out of bitcoin

If by ""genius Core devs"" you mean [Satoshi](https://sourceforge.net/p/bitcoin/code/131/) ([here specifically](https://sourceforge.net/p/bitcoin/code/131/tree//trunk/script.cpp?diff=515630145fcbc978e39dbaa5:130)), you'd be correct.

If those aren't the opcodes you're talking about, perhaps you could enlighten us which ones *specifically* needed for smart contracts were removed by ""genius Core devs""."
"I just want to be *perfectly* clear.

You made the claim that the Core devs took the opcodes necessary for smart contracts out of bitcoin. Presumably for their own personal gain and/or to destroy bitcoin as banking shills.

I just provided you irrefutable proof that it was actually *Satoshi Nakamoto* that disabled those opcodes.

I presume you will now admit that you were wrong, update your comment, and never make that false claim again?"
Basically. In accomplishing its primary goals, Eth needs to have most (if not all) features that make a currency desirable. It's not all the way there yet (fungibility), but it does pretty well.
I see the bots are glitching...
.
"That doesn't make any sense. Satoshi clearly hated PoW and didn't think it was necessary, preferring to base cryptocurrency on 'social consensus' just like Buterin. That is how we know Vitalik ""embodies his spirit"". I have never heard of this unlikely 'Nick Szabo' character you mention. He must be a total poseur in the crypto world, some sort of a ruffian — perhaps even a highwayman. Why should we listen to *him* when we have Buterin? Next you're going to try to tell me that Satoshi didn't believe in forking the blockchain to edit out thefts, or some such nonsense. Pfffft!"
I see. Thanks for the info and not ripping into me :) 
/u/cryptochecker
"First of all, nitpicking so much wastes my time and makes _you_ look stupid. When profit do you get out of it? This kind of behavior is just irrational.

Obviously, you know I was leading colored coins project that time. So what I'm saying about it is based on first-hand knowledge and can be considered evidence by itself (i.e. witness testimony, if you wish). Obviously, I can back it with more material evidence, but what's the point? Do you think I'm lying about it? What would be my motivation?

Adversarial thinking is cool and everything, but this is a borderline paranoia. You should consider visiting a psychiatrist.

Second, you wrote: ""If it were true [Buterin tried to develop Ethereum on top of Bitcoin], you'd be able to point to specifically public communication where you attempted any such thing.""

This is _non sequitur_. An attempt does not always produce a public communication. In fact, it typically doesn't. So if you want to play a ""nitpicking anal nerd"" game, you already lost it. Your logic is not sound.

Another problem with you is that you based your accusation on what a 3rd party wrote rather than what Vitalik wrote himself. This is a gross offense. Imagine I'd accuse you of being a liar based on what Roger Ver claims you said. How would you feel about it? This is a very shitty thing to do, don't you think so?

But anyway, we can actually prove that Vitalik isn't a liar. To do this, we need more precise definitions of ""attemted"" and ""any such thing"":

1. ""Attempted"". Obviously, a bad decision can be ruled out at a very early stage. So a sketch of a design and a consideration should suffice.
2. ""Any such thing"". Does it have to be a project called ""Ethereum""? Or should we threat it more openly, as design can change over time? This is up to an interpretation.

For example, I'd consider ""any such thing"" an attempt to implement functionality which is present in Ethereum but not present in Bitcoin, on top of Bitcoin (that is, using Bitcoin blockchain). This is a reasonable interpretation because obviously a project can get features over time, what shows an effort is initial significant feature.

And if we say that a ""decentralized exchange for user-defined tokens"" is such a feature (after all, that's basically how Ethereum is used now), then Vitalik definitely made such an attempt within colored coins project, for example. He wrote more than test script, as a former leader of colored coins project I can tell you that as an authority.

If you define it more tightly as a project with programmable contracts which can own assets and release them when a condition is met, he did that with his proposed Mastercoin extension.

Finally, looking at what Vitalik actually wrote:

> Not Bitcoin because the OP_RETURN wars were happening at the time and given what certain core developers were saying at the time, I was scared that protocol rules would change under me

The concerns about Bitcoin developers being unsupportive towards protocols built on top of Bitcoin blockchain are very well documented.  They were very well known and understood among people involved in colored coins project, as well as metacoins like Counterparty and Mastercoin. For example, I designed EPOBC protocol to avoid OP_RETURN because there was real concern that this feature will be disabled. Vitalik was definitely aware of all these issues as being a person in charge of writing colored coins specification, as well as consulting Mastercoin people, etc. So to any reasonable person it's clear that what he said is true.

As for what OP_RETURN has to do with Ethereum, any kind of a protocol can be built on top of Bitcoin blockchain by embedding its transaction data into Bitcoin transactions (e.g. with OP_RETURN) and thus obtaining consensus over ordering of such transactions. Ethereum functionality can be implemented as a metacoin.

Finally, we actually have a very interesting chat logs which pinpoints exact moment when Vitalik started considering Ethereum rather than ""Super Mastercoin"". Chat log was posted by Yanislav Georgiev Malahov [here](https://medium.com/@yanislav/king-of-bitcoin-godfather-of-ethereum-a9af9ecf56d5). The relevant part (timestamps stripped for clarity):

     [17.11.13 01:05:01]
     Yanislav: if msc could encode itself in the bit coin block chain… that would be cool!!
     Yanislav: i mean: if algorithm changes are also embedded into the block chain… 
     vbuterins: okay, that would be cool
     vbuterins: although I would rather exploit an altcoin for that
     Yanislav: can we do this with the xpm block chain please?
     vbuterins: xpm maybe
     Yanislav: (y)
     Yanislav: let’s work together on this
     vbuterins: so, mastercoin on xpm with superadvanced features and source code updates in chain

So the idea which differentiates it from Super-Mastercoin is that the script code can implement the base protocol rather than just contracts which control assets. Yanislav proposed using Bitcoin blockchain for this and Vitalik considered it and said that an alt-coin would be better. Yanislav proposed Primecoin.

So we have direct evidence which 100% confirms what Vitalik wrote.

Is this enough for you, or are you going nitpick further, using obscure interpretations, playing dumb, etc?

And I gotta say I was considering alt-coins more friendly targets too, since Bitcoin has all this drama, politics, fanatics, etc..."
In fact only blockstream are setting the direction of protocol and that is a stupid direction (LN is prepaid card, a failed practice decades ago in finance industry). Honey badger didn't give a fuk since now its name changed to BCH, while the original bitcoin is infected by segwit virus and on the long path of death
If devs are not important, please fire those devs who prevented scaling and invented segwit virus, then bitcoin will rise 10x in value soon
If you are not able to see the truth, then consensus for you is just propaganda and politics because those affects most amount of people. Unfortunately, that is the status of majority of the people on this planet, so what? You admit politics is more important than facts or admit segwit coin is not bitcoin, your choice
"The separate blockchain for a premine allegation is also bizarre. The first distribution model I recall was a quarkcoin style with most of the supply mined over a three year period. I don't even recall a founder's pool in that discussion. 

The premine discussion itself lasted months and it was brutal with iteration after iteration trying to make it fair and transparent. But still the maximalists never seem to be pleased or even acknowledge legitimacy. "
"And what does any of this have to do with the Bitcoin project?  Recall the thread, the claim was he attempted to ""do ethereum"" on bitcoin but was prevented by developers.  Writing a colored coin test script once doesn't seem to have anything to do with that claim as far as I can tell... what am I missing?

>  People typically do the most important part of the work in their head.

Seems that some also have fights with Bitcoin developers in their heads too.  "
Hello. You are literate. I like it.
this stopped my crypto panic. i'm in the right place of maturity, while /u/nullc whines like a bearded baby.
I remember being struck by the vitriol with which the project was met by Greg, Gavin, Peter and others. What struck me was not the objections themselves (concern for UTXO bloat was perfectly reasonable, and was shared by the Mastercoin team as well), but the aggressive, demeaning and insulting manner in which they were put forth. The attitude alone was more than enough to push innovators away. And away they went. Just have a read through this thread: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=284178.0

"no he doesn't, Vitalik has more in common with other ~70% centrally premined bitconnect, bytecoin, onecoin, ripple and other projects that decided to [throw away decentralization](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereumfraud/comments/6bgvqv/faq_what_exactly_is_the_fraud_in_ethereum/) as the very very first thing they do for personal profit. 

* vitalik has zero credibility in blochain tech outside of his censored subreddits, even his previous project was as much of a scam as ethereum - [quantum computer simulation to break sha 256](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereumfraud/comments/760gmb/lead_developer_of_ethereum_raised_money_by/). Wish I was kidding.

* satoshi didn't premine 70% of his coin, and create the most centralized project with only history of security failures

* vitalik [constantly](https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/897846425593294853) takes credit for things he didn't invent and not citing, [eth has NEVER innovated](https://medium.com/@nextlevelcrypto/whats-the-story-with-smart-contracts-and-ethereum-c0d771fd9eb9).

* satoshi would never suggest using premined distribution for the horrific [Casper to make worlds most unsecure PoS](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereumfraud/comments/7djclm/casper_masternode_pos_variant_to_use_70_premined/) 

* satoshi cared about security, vitalik has never once sounded like he cared about security. their rushed last minute updates, failed soft fork, chain splits from implementation chaos that satoshi specifically warned about, unsecure contract code that caused several global attacks on network itself, centralized bailout of his own investment, confiscating money bc 3rd party wrote bad code that even stated any code they write set the terms and conditions. I don't get how it gets more obvious than 0% centralized premine being altered to 70% centralized premine.

* [no legitimate altcoin developer outside of chain of liars and thieves respects vitalik on technical grounds](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereumfraud/comments/7pe8ot/virtually_all_crypto_devs_and_experts_spoken_out/), for what seems like the same exact reasons people have against onecoin.

"You've got to be kidding me, I feel like I'm arguing religion here.  There's no debating the likes of you.  It's either your truth or conspiracy and politics.  You should consider joining church of Scientology or something.    

Edit:  Here, a conspiracy for you about lightning network currently being implemented (actually working, i know it goes against everything here, try not to pull your hair out):  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBHYWtd-b9g&feature=youtu.be&t=1m26s

Bitcoin will use blocksize increase as a last resort when it's actually warranted, not off the whim of someone who knows nothing about coding and developing, let alone efficiency and bandwidth issues, etc.  You want to let the angry farmers run the nuclear plant, be my guest.  But the amount of twisting and brainwashing going on here claiming a copy and paste with one variable change, already old and inefficient code is the ""real bitcoin"" or real Satoshi vision, you've got some nerve!  How in the world an upgrade to the code with segwit makes it not the real bitcoin is mind blowing, open your eyes man you've been brainwashed beyond repair.  
You must have been fuming at the thought of Tesla overhauling our electric power system so we're not in the shadow of an infinite number of power lines right above our heads, huh?  "
You're right, my memory is weak. Corrected.
"Ethereum rose 20x twice just after the segwit announcement DEC 2015 and its activation AUG 2017, do you think that is a coincidence? I really hope the name matter a lot. But after segwit virus infected bitcoin, bitcoin has dropped its market share from over 90% to less than 35%

It will be difficult for BCH to grow from the virus infected coin shadow, but some other coins who do not have such virus at all will grow strong"
Part of the argument (conditions?) for the dao fork was the timeline of the project and the percentage of funds affected. The hack was a huge amount of the total supply at the time, and while other hacks/bugs have cost more in nominal terms, not a single one has been *close* when measured as a percentage of circulating supply. I'd be interested to see the gox hack vs dao hack as a percentage of supply at the time.

They don't, it's a pipe dream."
If you are not able to see the truth, then you already fall for the LN religion. I managed projects with thousands of devs and I don't need more than one minute to see if an idea has been implemented before. LN is prepaid card, some old finance technology from 1940s, once used widely at telecom, but almost abandoned by operators today
"LOL, really?

[Here's](https://github.com/killerstorm/BitcoinArmory/commit/9fd7764edaf64188f5bf81393fc28e8da9e07da2) Vitalik's commit to ArmoryX, which was [a decentralized exchange prototype](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/16w5vp/colored_bitcoins_armoryx_p2ptrade_gui_is_here/). I.e. it allowed to trade user-defined tokens for bitcoins.

Vitalik also made an attempt to write a colored coin specification, in fact he was doing it in parallel with his work on Ethereum AFAIK. [Here's doc he made](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AnkP_cVZTCMLIzw4DvsW6M8Q2JC0lIzrTLuoWu2z1BE/edit).

His work on Mastercoin extensions is probably less public. The only thing I remember is him mentioning that ""metacoin"" approach is superior to colored coins since it allows more complex functionality like smart contracts. (I think it was in a reddit comment so it should be possible to find it but let's not waste time on this, OK?) This implies he was considering implementing Ethereum-like smart contract functionality on a metacoin.

I'm not sure why you require work to be publicly visible. People typically do the most important part of the work in their head. Even if it goes beyond that, a lot of information stays in private repos, private mails, etc. For example, I described CoinJoin in August 2012, that is, 1 year before you did. But I described it in a private wiki which was lost. Would you call me a liar too?

But anyway, there's evidence of Vitalik's work on Mastercoin extensions. [Here's](https://vitalik.ca/general/2017/09/14/prehistory.html) Vitalik's article describing Ethereum prehistory. From that you get to [Ultimate Scripting: A Platform for Generalized Financial Contracts on Mastercoin](https://web.archive.org/web/20150627031414/http://vbuterin.com/ultimatescripting.html). 

You can see many similarities with Ethereum:

 * contracts escrow assets
 * contract is identified by txid
 * contract functionality
 * proposes use of 256-bit integers

If you don't trust Vitalik's word on when this was posted, perhaps contact Mastercoin team to check with them."
"I mean I haven't seen that many sources either way. I don't think they're necessarily wrong in what they say. I might be completely wrong though, so I fully accept criticisms.

the 80 > 40 > 0 thing is true for both sides. I can see where Vitalk is coming from and the nullc guy. Vitalik claimed he felt opposition so didn't build on Bitcoin and nullc said Vitalik never tried - both true.

See where I'm coming from? I hope for transparency as well, and everyone seems to claim that nullc is literally Hitler with sarcastic quips everywhere...it is hard to follow conversation with all those damn quips."

just keep your key safe! keep your seed safe. and have all security features on your wallet enabled (fingerprint, sending password etc..)
If you have a spare USB key, you could make a bootable USB with a fresh Linux install, and load it with an open source paper wallet generator. You could then boot from this isolated OS, without Wi-Fi enabled, create your paper wallet offline, then shut down the computer and smash the USB key for artistic flair/style points.
Paper wallets are free. 
"If they get hacked the hackers will have a encrypted wallet. If then they get your password they get your coins. Having the wallet exist only on your own computer makes you a way smaller target. This again is the difference between central systems and decentral systems Blockchain.info is a central point to attack all coins at the same time. For somebody to target you they first need to know if it's economically feasible. Storing a little bit on blockchain.info is very handy .... but storing everything on them is stupid.

You have the tools to be your own bank now! Why rely on a blockchain.info bank? "
"Yes, unless you're like me and you don't bother with proper information security at home. Then I'd rather trust HTTPS and a simple virus scanner on a private network over keeping my entire life savings at the mercy of bits on one or two pieces of hardware and some keys  that I can lose more easily. And if that gets hacked, there's nothing legally to protect me or help me get my money back.

(this is of course a very subjective decision too -- I just pointed out how Coinbase today has some insurance for the sake of sharing relevant information)"
I guess you missed the memo about no politicizing 
1. People shouldnt have their bitcoins in LN at the moment. 2. You can close the LN channel anytime you want.
Your 24 word backup is the seed which your private key is derived from.
If you have a ledger nano S, you don't need to know. Alt you need to do is keep your *seed phrase* in a secure place (places).
If you need to move your bitcoins in a hurry then make sure you have the correct fee and you will be confirmed in the next block. If you have put the tx through with a low fee and its stuck in mempool, then you could use the RBF function if your wallet supports it.
"We should all be banning together like we did in the begining... Remember when crypto was going to change the world? Well it's happening now, we could be so much more effective if we stopped the infighting and got back to spreading awareness. 

I remember how welcoming crypto community was in 2011-12. I knew a little programming and was very excited at the possibilities. The community was always helping each other, now we have divided and conquered ourselves by fighting over which coin will rule them all. "
"And I do go on less than reputable sites from time to time 😔 

This is probably stupid but Mac's are also susceptible right? I remember hearing they don't get viruses but I believe that is not 100% accurate. "
"Two potential points of failure:

**1) The computer you use it on**

* Viruses, malware, keylogger, clipboard copiers, OS version vulnerabilities, hardware (things like Meltdown and Spectre)

**2) Exodus software/updates**

* Security vulnerabilities, server hacks, email hacks, fake new versions

If we discount point 1, which we shouldn't as it is probably the most vulnerable point, is Exodus safe?

It seems to be. But that doesn't mean it always will be. Keep an eye on the patch notes, the twitter, Reddit, regularity of updates. Ultimately no software is 100% secure and it is up to you to choose responsibly and change if you have to.

But yes, you control the keys with Exodus."
 Fair enough. Now realize the exchange can make those withdrawal fees higher any time they wish. Or they can suspend withdrawals any time (and do).

"> really surprised at all the downvotes

NEVER store your coins on an exchange, insured or otherwise. The insurance would cover the fiat amount at the time of the loss, not the amount the coins may end up going up to. That's what Bitfinex did, and people lost an enormous percentage of their cryptocurrency, and they were out their money for a long time. Besides, it's beside the point anyway. It goes against the very nature of cryptocurrency, which is to be your _own_ bank. You should never tell people things that make them feel like it's ok to store on an exchange. And If they can't store their own keys responsibly themselves, then they shouldn't be in this to begin with."
if you can simply switch out the drive in something and just store it
Use an offline password generator or even excel to generate a paperwallet. Print paperwallet. Send coins from exchange to the paperwallet. Make backup on usb stick. Store both safely. Done. Just dont be to lazy.
"just buy a hardware wallet like Nano Ledger or Trezor. Although they're not ""BCH-friendly"" they're great hardware wallets. 

the information about installing linux and such are for safekeeping your coins EXTREMELY "
"It really depends on how paranoid you want to be with your coins. (Which probably depends on how many you have)

At a basic level you can just download Electrum/Electron Cash, encrypt your wallet with a password, back up your private key and/or recovery phrase, and send your coins to it and be good.

However, your private key could be leaked at the time of creation or anytime you input your password if your computer is compromised. So if you're dealing with a decent amount of money you'll want to take additional steps.

For dealing with the long term storage of no more than a few thousand dollars worth of btc/bch, this is what I'd recommend if you don't want to fork over cash for a separate computer or a hardware wallet (or reading other comments, you just can't get ahold of a hardware wallet yet):

1)Create a Linux live CD/usb, preferably with a Bitcoin wallet pre installed. I'd personally recommend Electrum/Electron Cash, but there are many suitable modern wallets. If using a USB, make sure that you don't have the option on that allows files to be stored in it's filesystem. You want a clean slate every time for maximum security.

2)Boot in to the CD/USB, and create a wallet. Back up the recovery phrase with a pen/paper (anything non internet connected is fine, a typewriter would be perfect if you have one lying around or you could even etch it into stone/metal). I'd also recommend including at least the name and version number of the wallet sofwate that you're using. Deposit a small amount of btc/bch at an address generated from this wallet.

3)Reboot the computer and boot into the live USB/CD again. Use your recovery phrase, and ensure that your small deposit shows up in your wallet. If so, you're golden! Testing your backup before you add significant funds is extremely important because any typo could result in a total loss of funds. Make (non-digital) copies of your wallet backup, and ideally you should test restoring from them too.

4)Find suitable physical locations to store your wallet backups. This is harder than it sounds, because while more is better, quality of location is also just as important. Anyone with access can completely wipe you of your bitcoins if they know what they're doing. This is essentially cash under the matress, except that losing security over even one of these can lose you everything. You also really want at least 2 completely different locations in case of fire or similar disasters.

Past that, I'd look into multisig wallets. This will greatly help with the physical security aspect of keeping your backup because now you don't have to trust any 1 individual or point if failure. If you make a 2 of 3 multisig bitcoin wallet for example, that means you need any 2 of the 3 keys to access your bitcoin. So with a 2 of 3 multisig wallet then you can keep 1 on your person/in a fire safe, 1 at your parents or close friend, and 1 in a bank safety deposit box. This is mildly inconvenient, but worth it because now you can't be robbed, your friend can't steal your Bitcoin, a rogue bank employee can't steal your Bitcoin, etc.

Keep in mind that you can always deposit to the address at your own convenience as you accumulate more coins, you only need to restore the wallet to actually send the coins somewhere.

I hope that helps, I'd be happy to give further advice if needed."
Coinbase, Xapo. 
"I switched from two full nodes to a ledger because it was eating away my data limits. It was super easy to setup and feels really solid. I'd highly recommend them to anyone that wants to ""physically hold"" their coins."
Exactly this. Noobs who signed up for Coinbase in 2012 and just hodled in their Coinbase wallet could be millionaires now
"*  Don't be TO paranoid. At some point you will have to trust SOMETHING or you can't live your life. 

* Use linux and keep your linux up to date. 

* Don't install linux programs unless they are from a trusted source and you know what you are doing. (if they need sudo you better make sure the program can be trusted!) 

* backup your seed on a piece of paper (maybe on two) 

* Keep your seed in a save place where nobody will look or if there are a lot of coins on it get yourself a real safe. If more then half of your savings are on this piece of paper better keep a copy of it at a separate place like a deposit box at a bank. 

* if there is no seed print of your encrypted wallet file and save the password to decrypt the wallet on a piece of paper. Don't ever rely only on your memory. If you don't use a password or passhrase for a  couple of years YOU WILL FORGET IT. 

* Don't forget that Bitcoin usually sends the chance (if you send less then a 100% of the balance on a address) to a change address. You better have this address backed up if it's not part of the seed!!!!! Lot's of people have lost coins because of this, don't let it happen to you! 


* [use the 3-2-1 backup rule](https://medium.com/meet-lima/the-3-2-1-backup-rule-d62b78f94238)



* Test you backups every month. A non tested backup is no backup. 

* Every couple of months move a tiny bit of your cold storage coins around just to check if everything is still working. The network also always changes a little bit, so keep up to date! (but don't get worried about every little detail and story, Satoshi knew what he was doing better then anybody else) 

* If you have coins in a wallet file or on an address that you cannot afford to loose then never expose the private keys to a computer system that is hooked up to the internet. This concept is called cold storage. You can sign transactions on offline machines (airgapped) and then manually copy them on to a online machine where you can broadcast to the network.

* When in doubt ask your questions here and learn how to recognize the trustworthy people on /r/btc 

* If you are holding a significantly sum in crypto then don't let anybody know how much crypto you are holding ... don't make yourself a target! 

* If you are using crypto exchanges make sure to enable 2FA over 2 separate devices (like laptop + phone) 

* Relax, 100% security is impossible but if you are willing to learn, even if you don't know computer to well it possible to  safely secure your own crypto.

Why is the tribalism there I wonder? Purposeful tactics? Maybe.
"> For somebody to target you they first need to know if it's economically feasible

No they don't. All they need to do is design their attack so that each additional attack is a low addition to total cost (which is the case with most malware). They can infect one million computers with little additional cost. They only need one fool to keep their wallet on an internet connected machine to make their attempt worthwhile. "
"For that reason we ( btcpop.co ) made our cold wallet address public and signed a message with it and the balance covers already close to 4x the user balances :-)  ( BTC )
We need to do that for Bitcoin ( BCH ) as well.  
We offer legit investment options where the money doesn't come from some secret ""algos"", those bad players makes it harder for the honest players as well but for us its okay if users withdrawal all.  
When BTC spiked close to $20k a lot coins was withdrawn and except that we had to pay crazy fees for hot wallet refills there wasn't any issues :-)
"
"Keeping cash in your physical wallet isn't ""stored away"" any more than keeping cryptocurrency in a digital wallet is ""stored away"". *Most* cryptos are designed to be spent directly from a user's wallet and if this isn't possible with a particular coin I would seriously reconsider if I even control those coins in the first place."
Read the fine print.  If someone hacks your account and withdraws your coins, the insurance does not cover that.
Just because one company (lloyd's) has sold insurance to another company (coinbase) **doesn't mean that you are controlling your bitcoin**. Which is the entire point of the post.
actually a lot due to hard drive crashes or forgetting their password. 
It's not a fight most people wanted, it's that not everyone wants to follow the core agenda.
"*you* made it political right here:

> Are your coins locked in a timelocked contract? While they're technically still in your possession, you've relinquished control - you don't control your Bitcoin if you can't actually move them onchain when you need them.

this is only technically correct - distinction between ""under my control"" and ""my property"" is largely irrelevant and makes your post an obvious jab against LN, which in itself makes it political.

when you enter your car and go on a highway - you're not considered ""detained"" just because you can't leave immediately. you're still in control of what is going on with your freedom."
I guess.  But why? I want to see people utilizing crypto currency .  If they store it away then what’s the point? 
You're the one who made it political by including a thinly-veiled attack against LN in a post of otherwise-good and politically-neutral points.
"The issue is you could get a virus and then you’re screwed. Online wallets can be phished.

"
Generating them *securely* when you don't trust your computer is not easy.
As secure as any other file on your computer. If you get any virus/malware it could wipe your funds.
If you have the seed phrase written down you can restore your wallet on another device.
What if my device gets broken somehow ?
It's not just about the core agenda. Tribalism is rife throughout crypto. 
Thank you :) I’ll do that as soon as I can 🙂

I think hardware wallets are unnecessary for most newcomers. A lightweight client like Electrum where you hold your private keys (seed) is enough for them, in my opinion.

how many ppl have lost their coin b/c they forgot the password? or lost their computer?
Lightning Network is not the only use of time locks
Also use linux over windows and you are a way smaller target. Linux is also FOSS and goes hand in hand with Bitcoin Cash. Same type of people. I use Linux Mint with Electron Cash and I feel more then save enough. I could never trust windows like that. Even though I know how to keep my windows save ... it's not worth the gamble.

"Macs can get viruses. They have less market share and thus there are less viruses targeting them by they are by no means ""virus free""."
"no. i think its human nature. Money is inherently linked to survival (for the most part you need it for pretty much everything - shelter, heat and food for example). 

People understand that the more people use and value their preferred currency - the more valuable it is; the more money they have; the more they can purchase with it.

so long story short - it's a survival mechanism.   "
"Tinfoil hat time, but it wouldn’t be TOO crazy to think that Big Banks and Governments purposely foster those divisions.

"You are correct. Any browser app that works clientside (decrypts wallet clientside in browse) is way better then an exchange. But you are still trusting a website instead of your own computer. I would not store bitcoin cash worth more then 1000 CAD on blockchain.info.

It's just to risky. And what if when the price tanks and you want to sell suddenly blockchain.info website is down? Not to many people have a copy of their JSON encrypted wallet. "
Appreciate it, that's what I thought. 
I agree for the most part, it could be two fold though, manipulating peoples opinions and discussions on top of that underlying survival mechanisms most humans inherently have.
Very true haha, it seems unlikely that it'd somehow be a huge conspiracy to undermine crypto, but it's not impossible. I agree with your second point as well, it's hard to find the truth and sometimes it just boils down to whichever philosophy you agree with more.
If your using an online wallet use blockchain.info but use the tor link you can make a wallet and then they give you the 12 words make you type them in to verify you wrote them down then go into electrum and make a new wallet and click you already have a seed and you can enter the one from blockchains wallet thats what i did 
"I don't have much BCH, is the bitcoin.com wallet good enough? 

How do I know if a wallet is a hosted wallet? Or if I'm the one who only know my private keys?"

Where can I keep my alt coins like the newer ones . My Trezor doesn't hold them and I want them off the exchange 
Probably should make this a sticky!

Thank you for posting this!
Great post man... I grow weary of the politics... let's just help people regardless of their beliefs.. I'm a BTC guy btw... but I can respect a good post..
Is the value in a Bitcoin UTXO less than the transaction fee? Then you don't control your Bitcoin because Blockstream has deemed your Bitcoin not valuable enough to be able to spend. 
"You can generate a paper wallet here: https://cashaddress.org/
If you believe your computer may be compromised, you can download a Linux operating system that runs on a USB flash drive here: https://tails.boum.org

You can verify your paper wallet contains your coins by plugging in your public key into a block explorer such as: https://explorer.bitcoin.com/bch

When you want to extract your bitcoin, you can import your paper wallet into software such as electron cash and send it off to an exchange or wherever"
Wait so what should I do?
Really commendable thread. This is what we need more of.
"I've been wanting to move my coins off of exchanges for a while but every time I try to research how to safely do it, the information seems scattered and overwhelming. 

Do I really need access to a new laptop I use for nothing else, a clean install of Linux, etc etc or is there a middle ground for people who don't have an extra laptop laying around?

I've tried searching but if anyone could link to a helpful post with instructions that would be dope too"
Can you give an example of a hosted wallet?
Are people ready to control their coin? do they backup their machine can they remember their password do they know if they forget(or get incapacitated) the password they lose all their coin forever? maybe for some its safer to store their coin in coinbase?
"A good strategy that is easy to understand and execute is:

1. Buy a cheap brand new android smartphone

2. Connect to safe WiFi.

3. Download Jaxx and/or Breadwallet 

4. Write down back up seed on paper and store in safe place.

5. Put password on wallet and/or lock screen on phone. Also put this password on paper with seed.

6. Transfer funds to wallet.

7. Turn off phone and store safely (in a 
separate location from back up seed). 

Edit: slight change to order as per /u/Spire"
"The first 4 points are cases where your money might get stolen by somebody else if they don't fulfill their promises. And absolutely right, in those cases it's not your Bitcoin, it's someone else's Bitcoin.

The 5th point appears to be a cheap shot consistent with jessquit's apparent agenda against Lightning Network."
So when the mempool is backlogged and I can't move my coins when. I need them I don't control them? 
Blockchain.info wallets are good as well. You have access to the private key as well...
Reminder:  Limited block space pushes people to do the exact things they aren't supposed to do like leave coins on exchanges due to high fees.
"this is false. coinbase rewards are for all intents and purposes property of miner that found the block but they aren't ""ready-to-transact""."
But it's not ready to transact because the BTC network has random periods of multi day confirmation times...
Ok, with that in mind, what are the best options to buy and sell cryptocoin?
are your coins in LN blockchain ? You don't control those coins.
The only reason why Im Not doing this is that I don't trust my PC. I will lose it, it will break or get stolen or will have a virus. And I'm still not even with my initial investment so I'm not buying a hardware wallet.
My wallet is so far behind it's taken two days to sync, so it's not ready to transact, but I would suggest I still control those coins.

Does this mean that android app wallets more vulnerable?  Should I Be Investing in an offline wallet? How do i prevent getting scammed with a offline wallet? Im still vety new to this and have been listening to the princeton crypto lectures to try to understand it a bit more. I figure storing bitcoin in the most crucial aspect
"Coffee... 3 dollars plus 70 dollar transaction fee on block chain.

Fwiw, I have a ledger Nano s and have no idea what my private key is or how to control it. 
You cant move your coins on chain when the mempool is few hundred thousand transactions deep. Doesn't mean you dont own those bitcoin. Lol

"Thing is, if he ever intended or had any ill feelings against Wall Street and banks, he could've and would've proved it by simply going into the subject. Because anything on the subject for the listeners hurts the corruption.

The corrupt politicians won't talk on the subject they're corrupt on, they'll just buzzword on the subject. Trump is just like Hillary, just like Hillary said about Wall Street, ""I will tell them to cut it out"", lol."
Different camps. Like eveything else it's complicated
"Dude, what? Trump called out Wall St and the banks like every speech. Did you ever actually listen to his speeches firsthand? And no, bitcoin is a system of government - taxes as we know them will not exist under a nation that is based on crypto ... unless you are corrupt socialist dictatorship Venezuela, then you probably hardcode taxes into the blockchain to pay to ""The Party"" "
Another possibility: They can both be wrong.
"Are you saying, with a straight face, that Bernie Sanders *doesn't* want the government to control more of the economy, and to forcibly determine where more of individuals' money ought to go?

Anyway, I would agree that there are two facets distinct facets to Bernie's proposals:

He advocates for both socialism (such as in creating a nationalized monopoly on health care) and fascism (such as in heavily regulating industries that remain under private ownership, thereby leading to further consolidation and barriers to entry, whether he intends to or not.)

Practically nowhere does he advocate for increased freedom over what we already have.

And obviously, his policies would require running the printing press full blast at all times, just as all developed nations are currently doing, and as Trump will have to do as well.

Sanders would just have to do it even faster and even more destructively, as he proposes spending *even more* money that the government doesn't have and won't reasonably be able to bring in through taxation.

People like Trump and Sanders (and practically all politicians, really) are exactly why Bitcoin was created. Do you think the quantity cap was an accident?"
"Dude, I don't think you've ever listened to anything he said beyond the sound bites and edited fake news shit, he literally turned establishment finance into his enemy with his speeches and rhetoric. Remember the Wall St people crying about the tax cuts saying how bad they would be?? You've already made the *choice* to believe otherwise though, so I doubt you will change your mind. 

Hillary had Goldman Sachs paying her like 250K for a dinner function... come on dude, it's very clear from the slandering he received in media that the establishment (big money and big media) were against him. 

"
"Uh-oh. Lots of socialist and statist support here in the r/btc sub as well. That does not bode well.

The whole point of Bitcoin is to take the power of the printing press away from governments, and to limit their ability to inflate, regulate, censor and tax.

Of course, when you do this, you also destroy the corrupt cronyist system that is modern banking, which requires government support and bailouts to go on existing. And that's a good thing. But the corrupt banking system is an outgrowth of a corrupt state, not the other way around.

Seriously, if socialists think Bitcoin is a good idea, that's scary. They'd probably want to nationalize it and regulate it and subvert everything it's supposed to do.

Bitcoin is supposed replace government controlled money with a free market alternative. There is absolutely nothing about that that jives well with socialism or even so-called ""social democracy"". The two ideas are incompatible and mutually exclusive."
Oh no! A lying womanizer in the White House??? What are the odds??
Don't worry pede, I got your back 
I read to here and loled. I'm thinking the whole time, hey wait, aren't these two guys arguing the same side. Oh internet, don't go changing.

"> If you don't know who the earliest adopters and proponents of Bitclin were and what their reasoning was for supporting it, try Google sometime. It's this new website where you can look up commonly known information. 

Lol. I've been in bitcoin full-time since 2012, I know who the early adopters and proponents were. They were cryptographers and cypherpunks. I suggest you take your own advice. Or redefine what you meant by 'started' if you want to backpedal to talk about the people who got into the market after 2 years.

Alright, state owning the means of production isn't what I'm thinking when I'm talking about socialism. This is what I'm thinking:

* a system or condition of society in which the means of production are owned and controlled by the state

Where the difference is that that's not the entirety of production. Rather, for example: healthcare, or school tuition, or basic income

Your definition doesn't seem particularly conventional, considering what socialism really is in countries with regular western socialized policies (in other words, not Venezuela, lol).

> All socialist nations to date have controlled and manipulated the money supply, and need to do so in order to manipulate and control markets and the population. Lenin specifically advocated for this, among others.

> The Scandinavian countries are NOT socialist. They are, relative to the rest of the world, very free market economies with a giant bloated welfare state they can barely continue to afford.

If we go according to your conventional socialism, then yes I fully agree. I'm not really sure how the discussion came to this though? Bernie Sanders is *definitely not* socialist by your conventional socialism, so where are we even going here?

> In general, they mean a system in which people say ""I want the government to control more of the economy and tell people I don't like what to do and where their money has to go"".

> That is precisely what Bernie Sanders supports. The man is no voluntaryist, minarchist or libertarian, obviously.

"You also don't have to _like_ every position you care _about_. Language can be tricky in this sense, because it's contextual. I don't care _""for""_ bad ideas, but I need to _""evaluate""_ ie take them into account.

"Stock market was going up under Obama too. So-called ""unemployment"" was going down too.

"> No, Bitcoin was started by libertarians, voluntaryists and anarchocapitalists

Source.

> to take the power of the printing press away from governments, and to limit their ability to inflate, regulate, censor and tax.

Yes, I agree. That doesn't mean bitcoin removes taxes entirely though, does it?

> But the corrupt banking system is an outgrowth of a corrupt state, not the other way around.

As it's clear Bernie Sanders understands too.

> Seriously, if socialists think Bitcoin is a good idea, that's scary. They'd probably want to nationalize it and regulate it and subvert everything it's supposed to do.

Why? What kind of socialists are you speaking of here?

> Bitcoin is supposed replace government controlled money with a free market alternative.

> There is nothing about that that jives well with socialism. The two ideas are incompatible and mutually exclusive.

Why does socialism have to have something to do with monetary policy for you?

> Where there is freedom, there is no statist socialism, and where there is statist socialism, there is no freedom.

No freedom? .... Let me ask my fellow Scandinavian friends how they feel their freedom compares to a country like the US. You did say *statist* socialism though, not sure if you mean that as an adjective for a part of a spectrum of socialism."
"Incorrect. Obama did not promise marriage equality. He was against it when he ran.

Also: Anyone who thinks that Federal so-called ""consumer protection"" power is a good idea should get as far away from Bitcoin as possible.

All the government is supposed to do in that arena is to offer recourse against force and fraud through the court system.

And please tell me: How the hell is a comment criticizing a president for needless warmongering getting *downvoted* on a *Bitcoin* subreddit?

If you think bombs are great as long as it's your ""team"" dropping them, then Bitcoin doesn't need you."
"I'm no Trump fan, but the amount of support in this thread for Bernie Sanders and statist socialism in general does not bode well for Bitcoin.

Great, let's see if he actually does it, don't act like he's actually done all of those already.
"How any Bitcoin supporter could be for so-called net ""neutrality"" if they've ever actually studied the issue in any real depth from both sides is beyond me.

It's like ""great, let's fix the problems of too much government regulation by adding more government regulation"".

No thanks.

The levels of cognitive dissonance required to believe that and believe in Bitcoin at the same time would be far too much for me to bear."
Someone please explain the downvotes on these comments.
"Sure, one should be *aware* of what others think. But being *aware* and *caring* are two totally different things.

Trump is going to spend almost 1 trillion on infrastructure and tackle the opioid epidemic, and make prescriptions cheaper.... *while also cutting taxes* 
"1. If you don't know who the earliest adopters and proponents of Bitclin were and what their reasoning was for supporting it, try Google sometime. It's this new website where you can look up commonly known information. 

2. Bitcoin by itself does not prevent taxation, no. But it cannot be seized by tax authorities in the same way more conventional assets can be, which was one of its key selling points.

3. Socialism, as conventionally defined, means a system in which the state (which is the organization that has a monopoly on the use of legitimized force within a society) owns the means of production (meaning businesses.) That is what I am referring to.

4. All socialist nations to date have controlled and manipulated the money supply, and need to do so in order to manipulate and control markets and the population. Lenin specifically advocated for this, among others.

5. The Scandinavian countries are NOT socialist. They are, relative to the rest of the world, very free market economies with a giant bloated welfare state they can barely continue to afford.

(And which they are finally starting to reduce in size because of how much of an impediment it has been since it began in the late 20th century, long after they created so much of their wealth through markets.)

They vary in their degree of market freedom, but like the US, they are effectively ""fascist"" in the economic sense. (Meaning a system of private ownership under state direction.) Many of them however, have freer markets than the US though, and all are among the freest markets in the world, currently.

(The world could do a lot better in regards to economic freedom, obviously.)

Anyway, theoretically, you could have a smaller voluntary socialist society within a larger libertarian society. But 99% of the time, that is not what anyone--supporters or detractors--mean by ""socialism"". 

In general, they mean a system in which people say ""I want the government to control more of the economy and tell people I don't like what to do and where their money has to go"".

That is precisely what Bernie Sanders supports. The man is no voluntaryist, minarchist or libertarian, obviously."
A politician not following through on their promises??? Why, I never. What is the world coming to?
cuck
Bitcoin might be loved by libertarians but it's not just your personal Jesus.   
None of those make any sense, you're talking out your ass. I can see a non government controlled bitcoin in a socialist style environment. The government doesn't have to control everything for a socialist. Banks and money always have power regardless of if there is a government system in place or not, that's how it had worked for years before democracy was even a thing, socialism doesn't have to fit within your cookie cutter definition, I'm sure someone fed you.
That's funny. I guess it didn't work :)
"> Trump called out Wall St and the banks like every speech.

Yeah, a quick mention of them in order to lay that at rest and get more votes. At no point did he give any details or talk about their corruption. Had he actually meant it he would've at the very least at some point actually talked about it rather than just have it as a buzzword mentioned in his speeches. This was clear to anybody serious about the subject.

So what about sales taxes?"
