There is no doubt that decentralization is the future technology that will be as popular are useful as internet, everything that is new takes some time. Ethereum and XRP both are totally different and also unique in their usability. They are developed to solve different purpose. It doesn't matter who is at the top in terms of market cap rank.
No idea what that even is or how to do that
Yes. So true. They needed their thin air tokens to fund their company Ripple
There are alternatives to cmc.... stuff like enroyd.com or moonstats.com
"Oh my god. This is by far one of the best compliments I have ever received from a fellow redditor.

Shill in a camouflage.  You see, thatâ€™s why I also study PUBG to learn more about hiding and sniping. "

Well, that's a great news!!!
The only useful dapp is an illegal one.  And once(if) an illegal ETH dapp comes online - it would be trivial for the centralized ETH influencers (EEA) who just recently lobbied their way out of being ruled a security to be pressured by the government to censor it.
How did you say so?
It's almost as if market cap is a really poor indicator of just about anything.

I have reviewed your contributions to this and other subs for the second time and updated my judgement.

Altcoin Camouflaged Pumper Shill (ORANGERED).

Subspecies: *Shillus substitutus celatus*. This is a rather rare subspecies of the Shill family, with differently built digestive tract. Surprisingly, it possesses pretty good camouflage skills."
Thatâ€™s when I tend to buy.

RES-tag info: Core Elite Shill (RED), subspecies *Shillus grandis*. This subspecies often wields leadership and observer functions in the packs of Shill species. This particular specimen is also old,  additionally experienced and should not be underestimated.

Recommend further study."
They aren't.. Banks aren't actually required to use XRP in their partnerships.
But the market price is partly driven by the circulating supply. I'm pretty certain if the circulating supply increased the escrow amount the market price would go down as well and the overall market cap would be somewhat the same. 
CSW chill? Lol ðŸ˜‚

Change that to top 10 (since it's still very early days) and also have a minimum age (at least one year old, perhaps?) and a minimum threshold of average trading volume.

the price is not even relevant. The XRP exists. Should we stop counting all the ETH/BTC/etc that GBTC holds in storage? Or anyone else doing long-term custody? Or even the exchange cold wallets? Or anyone else for that matter. If i lock away some tokens, should CMC stop including it in the overall market cap?

"> Vitalik also says he doesn't want Ethereum to be about him

Ugh, don't let this be the metric we use to judge leaders in the crypto space. CSW says the exact same thing.

Actions speak louder than words."
XRP doesn't qualify as a cryptocurrency. Its completely centralized so the comparison isn't even really fair.
Just bought a handful 
Let's make our perception over here equal. Don't be so judgemental either vitalik is adhering a cult or he's just doing his best this year.

Why don't they just reconfigure XRP's marketcap to only reflect the coins that are actually in circulation?

No. Altcoin Camouflaged Pumper Shill.

I misread you before, because you camouflage pretty well. This will not happen again.

I shall seek and tag all of you fuckers.

Now, get off my lawn."
