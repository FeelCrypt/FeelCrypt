I was j/k
At least you can share your opinion on this subreddit.
The blame is for unwillingness to compromise 
Im an ETH guy too, wasnt involved in crypto until 2016 and never held BTC/H. I read these boards just because bitcoin has such an effect on the rest of the market. As an outsider reading there is just so much toxicity here, and its really difficult to predict various outcomes, it moves so fast and is confusing as all hell. Bitcoin is by far the worst aspect of the crypto space. That said bitcoin cash appears to be the lesser of the bitcoin evils, at least they're not outright censoring dissenting opinions.

Probably. 
Yes.
AXA here represents the powers at the helm, and basically by not losing their money-printing powers.
Not right now, but they might be behind a few major Lightning networks.
From a debt based economy. Plain and simple, Bitcoin rewinds world valuations 30 years. Or fasr forwards it 30 years. Either way, its a game changer for debt based societies, of which AXA is probably near the very top.
Maybe they get the miners fees?

Gavin is embarassed that Craig is seeing all these disappointing developments after Craig handed Gavin the reins.
Core has completely defanged Bitcoin. Established banks and credit card companies are never going to be threatened by $5+ fees.
"I explain why extreme fee volatility is a natural consequence of small blocks here: https://twitter.com/badslinky/status/901160705822384128

Supporters of small blocks should have been able to foresee that this is a major cost to their scaling strategy."
Even with a 2 MB increase the hard fork would have happened. At the latest when 2 MB blocks were full.
I don't think a big block fork would have harnessed enough support to succeed in an environment of reasonable compromise. 
"As an ETH guy, I'm loving this discord. Cue michaeljacksonpopcorn.gif.

From someone who has $0 invested in BTC or BCH, I'm definitely in the BCH camp. Everything BTC/Core does makes me shake my head. Why pay $10 fees when you can pay $.10 fees? There is literally 0 competitive advantage to using Bitcoin other than legacy infrastructure which can change in a heartbeat. 

While I can appreciate BTC's slow and steady approach to development, you simply cannot survive when you have the smartest people in the world working on competing protocols that offer more utility and better governance and scaling solutions. 

Hope BCH makes it as at least you guys seem to be open to innovation and what's best for the currency, not trying to get a vice grip like control on the protocol. BTC will wilt and die.

"
[deleted]
Bitcoun doesn't have > $5 fees. Bitcoin Segwit does. Bitcoin fees are very low right now.
Bcore didn't let it happen. They made it happen. The fee market is exactly according to plan.
"There were plenty other solutions discussed, including adaptive ones. Forgot?

But lately (long after HK agreement) we find out that experts consider 1MB to be enough /s"
"I think OpenBazaar could really take off if they enable Bitcoin Cash.

Same with Steam and Bitcoin payments - who is willing to pay current high fees. It makes little sense for merchants to support Legacy Bitcoin under current circumstances."
Luke said we should wait for LN
"Well, I don't care about ""other coins"", I just want a Bitcoin cash version.

Actually, with Bitcoin cash as the base currency, all other can work over ShapeShift because of those tiny fees."
We really need support for Bitcoin Cash because it's cheap and scalable. It would be good for OpenBazaar as well. Right now, paying with legacy bitcoin is definitely not feasible when I am paying over $20 transaction fee. It's so stupid.
Please do, so I can use bitcoin AND OpenBazaar again! 
It doesn't need multiple coins. It needs cash.
I am willing to pay you $100 for those 5 mins. Choose your currency: BCH, ETH, DCR, XBC
As others said, it might be more work to release a version that supports multiple coins simultaneously, but much less work to just release multiple forks that swap one coin for another. Will be pretty happy with that.
Just a thought, but to be honest problems with BTC have been on the horizon for years. Given that crypto currency is so young, and the landscape continually changing, I would imagine it is in many businesses interests to remain as flexible as possible with coin acceptance. You never know when one of them might become useless or even compromised (e.g. bugs found) - although in the case of BTC, the warning signs have been somewhat more obvious.
"That is basically bullshit by some zcash person, pathetic really.

I would like if they are using it but I'm not quite a dark market user... 
"Thanks for being open to this option - that is awesome!

Right now there is a big opportunity in adopting this currency.
It's in the hands of countless Bitcoin holders already.
Money that clients could otherwise spend on goods is being hoovered up by network fees.
Small outputs become uneconomical to spend. All that is unlocked on Bitcoin Cash.

NOTE: _Of course, Bitcoin Cash users currently need to take into account when transacting that it does not yet have the privacy features and fungibility that some other coins do._"
I think those kinds of things are better suited for private coins such as Monero. 
dat you, trump? 
"Realisticly for them bitcoin is still the chain with the most potential to become the ""winning"" chain in the future. They haven't lost the ""fight"" yet (and should not give up). For open bazaar that doesn't matter though. A coin with low fees is best for merchants and customers. Not the market cap but the number of transactions on the  bazaar ads value. Low fees help with that."
"Luke also said 56GB per year outperform technology growth and thats why we need smaller blocks.  
He is right there!  
It would really be terrible to have my 2TB HDD full in less than 40y! :-("
"BitPay is stupid. With x2 the fees will go down to $10 and confirmation time will go down to maybe 1 day. Still completely unusable.

One can really hope that BSCoreCoin and BitPayX2Coin destroy each other in that fight. That would be good riddance, because both are fake Bitcoin. In the meantime miners should steal as much SegWitCoins as they can to buy Bitcoin cash."
Most of the so called privacy coins are nothing of the sort including Scamero.
Hmmm, not going to mention names, but that is the job of an anonymous crypto.
Dude use that honeypot scam if you want. Dont say you werent warned.
Monero?
ok, this is yuuuuuge!
"Well, for Stephen Pair / BitPay / Garzik this is not about the better or more secure version, they want to prove to the world that they can beat BSCore.

While a congested network might be better for all those exchanges that prefer some weird version of SegWit, it is actually BitPay that needs a working network and should actually fight for Bitcoin cash.

But sadly Stephen Pair ignores Bitcoin cash, because all he cares about is winning that silly dick measuring contest against BSCore."
Daamn not pulling his punches there.
We also just added Segwit support for the OpenBazaar SPV wallet. We're trying to adopt whatever technology we can to give users the best ecommerce experience possible on a decentralized platform.

"It's not an ad hominem to point out that you're misreading something.  

You ***are*** coming across as kind of stupid though, so your goal is obvious."
">I don't see an 8MB block as a tremendous improvement over 1MB blocks, especially if we are expecting mass adoption and continued growth.

mass adoption is what should be happening now.

80% of the market for mass adoption earn less than $10 per day. 

Bitcoin is designed to subsidize transaction costs by almost 100% to facilitate this mass adoption. - this subsidy will only be effective for the next 6-20 years, why squander it. 

Limiting transaction capacity to 1MB is forcing users who volunteer to adopt this new technology to big against each other forcing the cost to transact above the daily wage of the potential market. 

take a $5 investment in 2011 it would result in a $20,000 return today. 

in contrast a $5 investment in BTC is not disposable it's the average cost to transact.

both transactions take up the same space, why prevent $5 investments in bitcoin? 

>What's next?

lets get more adoption first - nothing changes why not limit at 16MB blocks? 

>What is the plan for visa-level scaling?

Lightning network! it doesn't need to be subsidized by limiting on chain transactions, forcing users to adopt it!"
If I had only become a pitchfork salesman. (sigh)

ps you have avoided answering the question, an opportunity to explain your position. 

>Why do you think everyone is wrong? more over lying?

"
"That reads an awful lot like ""There is no plan."""
It really strains credulity that core shoved this shit sandwich out in the first place.  Any first year maths student at a respectable university knows that LN is unworkable.  Has no one from core ever encountered an at least marginally educated person?  How else could they be sincere?
the plan in the white paper takes us 100 years into the future. what do you want a central authority to deviate and lead you with propaganda and censorship? 
"Of course there's not. How could there be? There's a short-term plan of scaling on-chain for as long as that is easy, and being open to other solutions in the future, including the dozens or hundreds of potentialities for off-chain scaling. That's all anyone could have if they're being honest.

To demand a plan for something so complex and so far off is to kill it before it even happens. Just because you can't imagine it doesn't mean those potential futures don't exist."
"Should Henry Ford have been selling the model-T by saying, ""don't worry, in a hundred years we'll have roads that look like [this](http://i.imgur.com/KQ2FmsH.jpg).""

It was perfectly fine for him to say, ""check out this cool shit, it's like a horse but better."" Right now banks are the horse-and-buggies, and bitcoin cash is the model-T. Bcore is trying to sell you [this](https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/madeinholland6.jpeg)."
"Lightning can be added to this increased block size also, reaching levels of visa scaling - No need for shitwit

Plus the problems of scaling are overcome when it is nearer the time to. This is the same evolution as the internet"
"That not right. Burden of proof is on whoever makes the claim. If it's ""common knowledge"" it's just really trivial to prove, so most of the time people don't bother.

**All** claims require evidence. Who makes what claim first is irrelevant. So is who makes the wildest claim. Just provide evidence when you make a claim. It's not that hard.

The guy being downvoted is actually correct. The other poster should have provided sources for their claims. Since they didn't, there's nothing for him to refute, and therefore no evidence to provide.

That said ""OP is a liar"" is not the way to ask for evidence. The correct way to say it would be ""OP provided no sources, so you should not consider anything they said to be more than opinion."""
planing is very different from limiting assess to the blockchain and forcing users to bid against each other to transact on a network where all transactions are almost 100% subsidized, is one sure way to kill adoption and growth.

"> BCash

Bitcoin Cash *"
Sorry, thought I was on /r/bitcoinmarkets.
"Well, that was my understanding too, but I've learned a bit from some of these replies - including what ""support"" actually means.

It turns out there are two kinds of ""support for SegWit"". Well, three, including the ""don't care don't upgrade"" path, but that comes with new caveats (later).

The first kind is the ""P2SH Wrapper"" kind and it wraps the witness hash in a dummy P2SH (""3"") address. Non-upgraded nodes see these as ordinary P2SH addresses and can treat them as such with no problems. They afford a marginal byte overhead against their P2PKH (""1"" address"") equivalent, but that is offset by the fee weighting system yielding a small fee savings (byte-for-byte vs. P2PKH).

The second kind is ""true SegWit"" and it's a whole new animal. They start with the actual ANY_CAN_PAY script operation which is now OP_SEGWIT. Old nodes will still view these as technically valid but nonstandard transactions and will be able to process them but not interpret the address, while fully supporting nodes will be able to validate the segregated witness data and decode the address. They take a new address encoding (appears to be another ""cool for cool's sake"" design: ""Bech32"", a special base 32 representation that has some error correction algorithm applied to it) and use a new prefix ""bc1""/""tb1"" that won't validate unless the software is updated to recognize the new Bech32 format. They offer a marginal transaction byte overhead savings against ""wrapped"" addresses because the wrapper is omitted.

Note that I said ""fully supporting"" earlier - this is distinct from ""supporting"". If you support the new ""wrapped"" addresses (and for validating software, this means witness validation), you support SegWit. This means a lot of non-validating services, or ones dependent on Core software validation procedures, were able to do nothing and claim support! However, what is unclear is how widespread ""full support"" is - meaning, the ability to interpret, validate, and process bc1 addresses. A wallet can support SegWit without providing SegWit, and that's a huge distinction that is very easily blurred."
Ahem.... Larger block size provided an IMMEDIATE RELIEF, these Core people are complete sellout twats... and the people listening to them? Wow, just wow.
This. The roadmap was quite clearly defined for bitcoin to remain as it was for long after we're all dead.
"""Even after SW activates, users will have to create new SW compliant wallets, move their coins into them, (spending a ""normal"" fee first), and then finally use them again to gain the benefit"".

OR, they can just sell all their BTCs and swap to BCCs"
"The ""normal"" fee required to move most wallets to Segwit addresses won't be what most people consider normal.  It will be huge.  The reason is that all of the UTXOs in the old format have to be spent to produce new Segwit output(s).  Take a look in your wallet and see how many UTXOs your funds are divided among.

I noticed how many UTXOs I had the other day when running the Trezor BCH claiming tool to claim my pre-August 1 BCH.  The transaction was huge, but because BCH has low fees it wasn't an issue for me.    *If I had been making a Bitcoin Core transaction to convert my outstanding coins to Segwit format the fee would have been well over $100 USD.*  WTF!"
just think of it as a penalty for all the would-be tax evaders. I wonder if core has ties to IRS?
Miners playing games again, mining empty blocks to keep the me pool full and the network congested for higher fees... This is why Tezos will be so successful... No miners! 
"Why do you think everyone is wrong? more over lying?

"
"I feel your pain RE: explaining why SW doesn't fix things. I did the same. It's factual information, yet still people argued like it was some opinion I had. 

You are spot on about LN. Siphoning fees off chain just reduces security as there is less profit for miners so they go do something else. I hear that mining equipment can be used for Bitcoin Cash! ;) 

You've also hit the nail on the head with fees, everyone focuses on $value of fees. Long term its about getting satoshi/byte down so it remains usable, at much higher coin valuations. 

This is why fees replace the block reward, because in large blocks, many thousands of tiny satoshi amounts can add up to just a few mBTC by which time BTC value is so high that in dollar terms those mBTC in fees are *very* valuable."
I shouldn't feed the trolls, but original statement or not the burden of proof is on the one making the extraordinary claim.  Since that's you, please provide the proof.
What.
