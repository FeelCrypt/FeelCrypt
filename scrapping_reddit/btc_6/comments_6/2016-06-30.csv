It's usually not a good idea to reveal one's attack plans to one's enemy.  Too much has probably already been articulated.
You could care less but still giving your opinion? What gives?
Why should they? They have been backstabbed by core simple. Anyways action speaks louder than words. Be patient.
"They gave their word and were holding to their side of the bargain. They were also assured 2MD hard fork by July. This is why they went into the agreement. They could satisfy both Classic and Core and kept all Devs rowing the same boat. 

Core renege on the 2MB part of the deal. This made them lose face big time. They did ask the community to give the Core devs a few more months then. Core left them holding their pricks in public. 

Something like this would have been signaled to the Classic team."
None yet. 
There are multiple implementations of the bitcoin software, Bitcoin Core being the main one used by miners right now allowing only 1mb blocks. There is also Bitcoin Classic (which is coded to fork to allow 2mb blocks), Bitcoin Unlimited and Bitcoin XT which also support bigger blocks. The market in general but more specifically miners need to get consensus over which implementation they want to run to avoid a split of the blockchain and now it seams they have agreed to switch from Core to Classic. If that happens, Core will be incompatible with Classic as soon as Classic starts generating blocks above 1 mb.

"Why not just sell your coins? Selling creates price pressure, which directly hurts the miners. Much more effective than ""voting"" (it's actually more cheering than voting) with full nodes.

If nodes are supposed to be voting instruments, we need an actual mechanism that enforces the voting results. And if nodes are critical for the network, they should get paid."
[deleted]
A decentralized market leads to an aggregate equilibrium, whether that is price in a trading market or hash rate in an algo. There can be organization without centralization. 
"I'm the opposite of an authoritarian. 

It is market driven. And miners themselves are also economic dependent nodes by themselves. If you want Bitcoin to be the most valuable, you should favour the economy making economic choices.  Which also allows Bitcoin to split and serve different goals. 



"
This is generally true but the environment that Core has created makes it politic to give the individual node owners a say (which, of course, they could have anyway if they wanted). BU is just a judo move on Core FUD.
"The cost of upgrading the limit affects the entire network, not just miners. Miners can still vote, but they need to represent the entire economy. 

Exchanges, payment processors are pretty silent in regard to the blocksize-limit and hardforking. Therefor it is not really fair to blame miners for their reluctance to choose classic over core. 

"
By all? By some accounts it is a hoax. This sub wants to believe it of course.
:)
I'll be following the miners are long as they are supporting my interests. The developers can release whatever shit they want. It doesn't mean anyone has to follow them.
All  major exchanges have been vocal with supporting bigger blocks. Miners making a move will make that happen.
what if the miners had not been representing the majority of the community, as the community has been shouting for 2+ years, and this *IS* the slow, careful, delayed reaction from miners after waiting for so long? The hypocrisy is really in full swing today.

"I agree. That would be my preference as well.

But I worry that the core shills have poisoned the well so effectively that we will never see a truly unlimited block size."
agreed, but baby steps, change one variable at a time. The biggest hardcoded variable to change right now isn't the 1MB limit, it's blockstreamcore.
Lets fork away from blockstreamcore first, then we can discuss the future.
2 MB hard fork is a simple quick capacity increase, hence can be implemented really fast. Segwit would then have the time to get properly tested (as a more complex solution).
A small price to pay.
Yes. A page in Chinese from unverified sources is more credible.
"its not about capacity increase. i am all yours regarding the 2MB or even more. no issue with that!

what most folks here are not getting are the consequences. 

what happens if the miners are forking? do you expect core to stay silent? of course not. they will immediately change the hash-algorithm, which means we have 2 or maybe even 3 versions of Bitcoin in no time. and dont expect everyone to choose the side of the chinese miners, i see alot of folks in the community who will refuse to go that way.

and now imagine how the media will play all of this mess? and how merchants will react as soon as they learn that now there are different versions of bitcoin and everyone says ""I am Bitcoin!""

seriously, even if you are in favor of 2MB learn to view things rational. 

prices would crash hardcore.

edit: its funny how you folks here have your own little echo chamber and are constantly confirming each other to be 100% right. as soon as someone comes with a different opinion your are all running around and giving downvotes to oblivion. :D"

You may want to re-evaluate your understanding of the market.  At least if you have more than a minor investment.  Nothing you said was accurate.
I was replying to a comment about some plan the miners apparently have to ensure 90%...
You can't measure 51%. You might hit 510/1000 blocks with only 45℅ and then trigger an unsustainable and very messy hard fork. 750/1000 blocks is very safe though.

">If classic we'll have to go thru this entire pain again to get off of 2mb in a year or so.

I'm sure a second time would be less painful. We'd have data and practical experience, which would increase confidence and make it less of an issue to fork for a permanent solution."
Maybe to whoever bought his principles.
Who cares? This is exactly what you've been asking for on the gold thread, and now you are getting it!
Because a 90%+ threshold is the same as giving a small self-interested minority veto power over a fundamental change. Whereas as, to block a change with a 75% threshold requirement requires a quarter of overall users (measured by hash power) to veto it.
Well the threshold is 75%.. Deal with it,
Personally, I would have preferred a threshold of 51%. 
"because 75 % is more than enough .

but blockstream core wanted to stall , so they sold this notion that 95 %, or 98 % or even better more than 100 % is the only secure way to do it . which is bullshit .

"
Nothing has happened yet besides an announcement from an unclear source.
After the fork activates there is still a grace period in Classic's code to allow other miners to change.
"The Classic hard fork mechanism has a built-in, non-reversible ~~2~~ 4 weeks ""grace period"" once 75% is hit. "
BTCC is the only one we are not sure now, people are trying to persuade them join
If actions of miners don't represent the will of the majority of community (as opposed to very vocal minority) or economic majority (?), developers can hard-fork to slightly different POW. Having all hashpower doesn't mean you own Bitcoin (Bitcoin network).

I couldn't disagree with you more. If people are so stupid that they didn't realize how much damage a 1MB blocksize restriction would do to this network, or if they are so gullible that Blockstream Core was able to fool them into not realizing it, then they should swiftly leave bitcoin and not look back. They can return when the price is over $1million/BTC, all of the central banks around the world are dying out, and the strength and position of this network as the backbone of world finance is secured for the next millennium. To a project such as this nothing is more dangerous than a bunch of easily-fooled useful idiots.

"That's very fuzzy. A prediction market would be much better, or letting coins split and making sure both can be bought and sold. 

But if we don't have this then miners need to gauge economic support and each should decide by themselves to the best of their ability and vote accordingly. So everyone has a different view who is important (and how much so), but regardless you will get a majority in the end. 

The problem is that most people who are into Bitcoin still want someone to tell them what to do. And doing nothing seems safer and more conservative.

No...it was a limit...effectively. By design. 

> Increasing the blocksize simply changes the economics of bitcoin back to what it was for most of it's history.

No it doesn't. In fact, it completely goes against the economics of bitcoin, i.e. **fee's going up to pay miners**. Something planned and acknowledged from **day one.**"
"Just to be clear, I do not think that the network will collapse if blocks are 2MB. The issue is that if miners, and only miners, switch to another implementation their blocks will be invalid in the view of all other nodes, resulting in a chain fork. If miners are stupid enough to stay on this (forked) chain, it will become worthless because no parties of the economic majority accepts their blocks. Additionally, if miners stay on their own chain the chain that the economic majority is on will slow down enormously unless the POW-algorithm is changed.

Having one fork with miners and one with the economic majority will arguably kill Bitcoin, as the security guarantee that miners provide no longer exists. There is also no way that transactions will be processed, unless the POW-algorithm is changed. In such an event, the Bitcoin-price will almost guaranteed tank massively and kill off (not literally) miners, users, exchanges and businesses. 

The issue at hand is that the proposed hard fork by miners is not supported (AFAIK) by the economic majority and will hence result in major losses and be unsuccessful. "

Which means miners wouldn't be creating 2Mb blocks in the first place if no one will accept them.

thats retarded there is no business what a block size is except the miners otherwise then you have all the nodes and people deciding and it never goes up and it should go up. listen to the economists if you have a line at starbucks you dont ask people oh do you want another starbucks you let starbucks make that decisions
It was effectively not a limit though as it was only constraining the supply in the event of a DOS attack, not a general use limit. It is currently being applied as a general use limit. Increasing the blocksize simply changes the economics of bitcoin back to what it was for most of it's history.
"I still don't see the connection between blocks being 2MB and the network collapsing. Are you implying that people 'on the wrong side of the fork' are going to lose their bitcoins and just walk away? I don't see how else the network would collapse from your view without the users simply walking away and there is no valid reason why anyone would just walk away after a simple hard fork event of increasing block size.

We're not talking about massive changes to the protocol or a hard fork that suddenly invalidates certain coins, obviously those kinds of hard forks can certainly be very dangerous."

Consensus is the biggest dirty word to come out of this whole fiasco. There doesn't need to be consensus! Miners vote with their hash power to better their economic position. Users vote with their wallets (by running Bitcoin, or another coin that suits their needs). 
You're probably right. It's just been extremely frustrating watching users like Feri22 be completely wrong about just about everything thanks to successful manipulation by blockstreamcore and theymos. Then they come here with their ignorance and start shouting bullshit.

Irrelevant. Pardon the all caps, but, THERE IS NO VALID TECHNICAL REASON TO EVEN HAVE A BLOCK SIZE LIMIT AT ALL. End of story. 
"I completely agrees with your goals but let me repeat this:

>If bitcoin become so centralized that banks or government can fuck us, there will be plenty of alts waiting to do the job you're looking at.

There is no need to steer back bitcoin because of that. Bigger blocks and forking was envisioned from the whole beginning by Sathoshi. Let bitcoin grow and become what is meant to be.  I very doubt bitcoin will become centralized though because there is no incentives for that. "
"""Bitcoins will be worth millions."" - i think right there is the difference between us, i am not in it for it's price, but for philosophical reasons...I think small blockers are here for cypherphunk/fuck you banks and governments ideals and big blockers are there for the price/get as many users as fast possible or some other coin will take them ideals...and also, the scalibility is being worked on, it will be reality, just not immediately...bitcoin won't die because of temporary higher fees...and that is the whole point...you are seing things only from the ecomomic incentives..bitcoin is not / shouldn't be that...we have stocks and banks for that..."
The blocks are that size because no one can *use* Bitcoin. Transactions are routinely stuck in mempool, and I am sick of seeing so many posts from newbies to all the time asking why their transactions are stuck. 
Stop being so scared of bigger blocks. If bitcoin become so centralized that banks or government can fuck us, there will be plenty of alts waiting to do the job you're looking at. Meanwhile, bitcoins will worth millions.

the average size of blocks in last 7 days was around 0.8 MB..

i agree we have to work fast, but there is still some time left for core to solve it by expert-skill coding...if you are scared that every user will run away from bitcoin because of slower network and higher fees, i won't...still better to use slower decentralized and immutable blockchain than faster paypal 2.0...it is fundamental question and i think you are for paypal 2.0 more than for what bitcoin was created for -> no government or central bank can fuc* us"
"> Without exchanges/payment processors Bitcoin would almost have any value.

As I said, they measurably and significantly add value to the Bitcoin economy by allowing willing traders to more cost-effectively find one another and engage in trade than they presumably otherwise could. This has no bearing on their insignificance in the Bitcoin economy.

> And they are all significantly invested. 

They may well have. However, they will not have done so in the capacity of an exchange, but as a business.

> Well I disagree.

That is inconsequential to the fact I described. It is fact that an economy cannot exist if its only constituents are facilities of exchange. And it is thus fact that facilities of exchange bear no economic significance.

> Btw, economic**ally** dependent nodes is a term coined by Adam Back I believe.

Yes. And its definition equals that of the economic actor, or agent; an entity influencing the economy through the act of producing, buying or selling. It does not describe the role of an exchange."
If Core was so popular then perhaps they wouldn't be routinely issuing threats about changing the PoW algorithm, etc., or pretending that  SegWit (soft forked, by the way, because consensus, right?) is a blocksize increase. 
core has an overwhelming majority of hash and full nodes, hence you should not be worried, right?
The hate is stronger here because our concerns over Core road map have been muted and ignored for too long now. There are real economic and market dynamic concerns over blocks being full and blocks capped to 1mb.
"Well I disagree. Without exchanges/payment processors Bitcoin would almost have any value. And they are all significantly invested. What weight their economic vote should have is still debatable. But it is definitely not zero, that's for sure. Although their power is derived in part from effectively being a gate-keeper. 

Btw, economic dependent nodes is a term coined by Adam Back I believe.

I get the point that Core devs listen to no one but themselves and the miners are getting pissed off and getting rid of them for good reasons.

"Those that are economically important in the Bitcoin economy engage in trade within it. Exchanges and payment processors do not engage in trade; all they do is facilitate it.

They add value to the Bitcoin economy through this service (because presumably through their being used they offer a more cost-effective method to exchange than alternatives can, and therefore allow trade between various market participants to be more appealing), sure, but they bear no economic significance as a result."
Exactly!  A soft limit can be whatever miners want it to be.
"Haha. This was a fun exchange.

"Fuck off with your manipulation and half-truths 

>No...it was a limit...effectively. By design.

The 32MB limit was not put in place. It was a result of the max message size AFAIK. This was intended to be fixed later. Satoshi then (very early on) implemented a real limit of 1MB specifically with the purpose of blocking DOS attacks and with the intention of removing/scaling the limit at a later date. 

> . fee's going up to pay miners. Something planned and acknowledged from day one.

Right, by increasing the number of transactions, not by increasing the cost of each transaction.

Seriously, you need to stop believing the bullshit being pumped in the new r/bitcoin."
"If you are right that the economic majority would not follow the miners, the value on the new chain will likely tank, and the miners would likely return to the original chain. It wouldn't even require a code change, just a setting to not create larger than 1MB blocks. Temporary disruption at most.

If however, you are wrong, and the economic majority accepts larger blocks, then we all roll merrily along - bitcoin user unaffected.

Are you arguing that people should be forcibly prevented from making a choice of their own?"
"Could always have them vote for whether they want that.

I don't see why we just don't cherry pick the good bits of Segwit (of which it seems most actually aren't going to make it into this release) and leave the chaff on the floor. Bundling is a disgusting tactic."
">If Classic rebases on Core 0.13.1, they will run it.

lol, you just dont get the point dont you? 
">Are you arguing that people should be forcibly prevented from making a choice of their own?

Of course not. All I'm saying is that it is incorrect to believe that miners control Bitcoin, as so many here (and in the general Bitcoin-community, too) believe. Miners are simply record-keepers and in order to sustain their operations will have to follow the economic majority's choice. "
"why dont you pick then just one of my points i made above and argue against it instead of just writing ""doomsday scenario""? lol"
"yeah exactly what i wrote. everybody will shout ""I am Bitcoin!"" how do you think investors will react to such a mess when everybody shouts they are now Bitcoin and everybody else is a scam?

core will do the exact same and will give interviews on NYT, CNBC and whatnot and declare that its just a miners cartel that seeks power and nothing else than an ""Altcoin"".

you got to be completely immature and inexperienced in finance to not understand how that will shatter confidence to the ground.

"after all we know about gmax,luke and others do you seriously expect a ""reasonable approach"" of them??

they would without a doubt change the hash algo.

>The scenario you are describing is likely to lead to a price drop to zero..

not zero but expect 1xx"
2 MB fork wouldn't get activated until they get the support of economic majority. Miners wouldn't act reckless as you think.
Well then Core will simply become an altcoin. I see no problem with that. 
">what happens if the miners are forking? do you expect core to stay silent? of course not. they will immediately change the hash-algorithm, which means we have 2 or maybe even 3 versions of Bitcoin in no time. and dont expect everyone to choose the side of the chinese miners, i see alot of folks in the community who will refuse to go that way.

Or they just move along accept to compromise and patch core with 2MB,

I think that all big exchanges and payment processors will side with miners on this. Core can change the PoW on its altcoin then.

3. The halving is not going to happen in a few days (9 to be exact)
4. The fundamentals like daily volume and user base growth are not getting stronger

What a delicious situation! Which one of those points would you like to tackle first? :D"
It's not actually LOCKED IN yet :-)
You're right, my bad.
Just wait to see, deadline is the end of This month
"I think there is some cultural sense of ""western imperialism"" of US/Euro VCs telling Chinese miners what to do. They have acted unilaterally and will continue to do so."
Well, they can give the miners and nodes what they want.
"$50 +- can do any single speculating entity with a few million $. You can't guess what ""economic majority"" is thinking from price movements.

For example - one angry early adopter can completely overshadow the thinking of million of Bitcoin users by dumping 100000 BTC at once (& triggering panic).

Welcome to the no-win situation that is any kind of discussion with small blockers. You literally just called us crazy for advocating moving away from a system that, clearly in your description, is completely blackmailed and controlled by core developers. Congratulations. Maybe you prisoners could also patrol the walls and man the spotlights here at the prison camp? Maybe turn in anybody that tries to escape Core?
"i am regular user, hodler since start of 2013...i am not for bigger blocks...does that mean my vote means shit? Are you really trying to let people with money incentive decide the future of bitcoin? Exchanges and miners are thinking only for profit...do you think it is possible that core devs are thinking pro decentralization and immutability and all the money incentived people are just following their greed? If this happen, bitcoin has lost the battle against greed and politics, because me, regular user don't want blocksize increase...my vote means nothing to you? If not, than you are hypocrite for being against core just for ""ingnoring"" another opinions...clearly there is no consensus, there is no consensus between miners, between users, between devs, between all exchanges...the hard fork should simply not happen...look on the data of nodes and hashrate...the classic numbers are/were decreasing and core increasing...it was about 5% for classic...where is your consensus for hard fork...you are blindly supporting brutaly enforced take over"
It's also not a good idea to bring about radical change to a financial system out of the blue, assuming you care how the market will react (on the whole markets don't like surprises).
Welcome to the Internet.
Assuming that Core does not subsequently acknowledge the new reality by implementing 2MB blocks as well. Which may be suicidal, should 2MB turn out to be the true desire of the economic majority.
I thought that for anyone who has a lot of bitcoins, it's worth running a node, so you can validate your transactions.
"I get what you're saying. It is not in your best interests from an immediate cost effectiveness standpoint. Tru dat.

You would only want to do it or not it because you want to or to  express(vote) your opinion with the tools you have. Might it be economically justifiable to temporarily run a fully validating node from a long term perspective if you believe a change would help  bitcoins health?"
"you can pay someone else to run a node its not too expensive except dont use classic-cloud.net they are a RIPOFF THEY TOOK MY MONEY

anyone who knows where they are and how to get my money back please contacting me"
"Ok I'll admit it, I don't know what economic dependent means. It just sounds like a term made up to divide the community.

Maybe you aren't an authoritarian. I'm sorry for jumping to conclusions.

And I love you even if you are an authoritarian..."
exchanges and payments have no need to worry about block size it is none of their business this is basic economics 101 
Yes definitely. 
"I mean he should sell his Bitcoin and move on.

That's exactly what he told us, right?"
So don't tell reddit about it.
In any case, we'd better make sure any split is not messy. Ideally, futures trading should be available so that everyone can have a reliable preview of what's coming.
Hmm, I'm more newbie than the average person. So you're telling me that there are 2 versions of BTC? How does that work?
You completely misunderstand the incentives behind bitcoin. Your doomsday scenarios are nothing but fantasy.
Or, better, make it several less-complex solutions.
"That's how I see the shitty fan spinning.  HF change vs. POW change puts everyone except the hardened core on the side of HF change.

Bigger disenfranchised holders dump, pro free market forces buy, non-ideological development talent shifts course, bitcoin continues as SHA-256"
The price was steady at 330, then the jump was minutes after the story showed up on the front page here and r/bitcoin (before it was removed). I don't believe that's a coincidence.
Do you have inside information?
Please keep us updated :-)
Well it's ultimately the coin holders that should be telling what miners should do. Unfortunately that did not happen.
They can offer the upgrade in core. Sure. But miners can run or not rub whatever they want. 
"Sure. And the single speculating entity is spreading out its buying over multiple exchanges in different countries and many many transactions over several hours just to remain undiscovered. Right?

Or ... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor"
"> i am not for bigger blocks...does that mean my vote means shit? 

No. It means merely that you may be out-voted."
"> Exchanges and miners are thinking only for profit

Bitcoin is money, show me who isn't."
"So, let's get this straight, you think that Bitcoin should exist without greed or transparent incentives? That it should just be some kind of idealized and imaginary system that automagically becomes ""decentralized"" just by saying that it is (even though Bitcoin development has been heavily centralized for quite a while, now) ? I prefer a system of checks and balances where the power of the core developers is checked by the power of the minors. You are not witnessing the development of an imbalanced system. You are seeing the system quite correctly begin to balance itself and the miners begin to band together against the overt corruption of the Core Developers."
Lol, you weren't even around when we hard forked in 2010, as well as 2013. You know not what you speak of.
"Takes time. Meanwhile there are tested 2MB solutions already deployed.

SegWit can be added on to them later."
"> Exchanges and miners are thinking only for profit

This is literally the entire basis for the system. Literally every point you made is either inaccurate or wrong.

Edit: I'd like to remove the aggressive first sentence. It was unneccesary. I apologise."
"My vote for bigger blocks have been ignored for more than a year. My vote doesn't count? Big blockers have been compromising from XT to a simple 2mb bump. Small blockers haven't comprised a bit to achieve consensus. Now is the time to eject the toxic people unwilling to compromise to achieve consensus. 

BTW bitcoin is market driven with economic incentives and markets are driven by greed and fear. If you didn't get that, then you didn't get how bitcoin actually works. "
Thats an interesting point, but do futures matter in the case of a fixed supply and fluidly transferable commodity like bitcoin?
"Economic dependent nodes is a term used to describe nodes which are economically important. So that would be exchanges, payment processors etc. 

Consider that miners create 2Mb blocks, but no exchange accepts these blocks. This basically means the reward the miners get cannot be sold on exchanges and is worth nothing. 

"
"> exchanges and payments have no need to worry about block size it is none of their business

They don't need to worry *because it's 2016 and technically there's no problem to safely the increase the block size.*

Not because ""it's none of their business"" - Bitcoin is their business too!

They have been silent because they didn't want to pick sides since the decision *should* have been a technical one, but running into full blocks also makes it economic."
I like all the value they're driving into alts personally.  These Litecoin blocks are sooooo full it hurts!
Me play nice. Me advice. One be censor proof. One be hype. 
There was **always** a blocksize genius. It is 32 MB, and is because all clients cannot send/handle any datastructure bigger than 32 MB. You people show how little you know about things more and more each day. 
"> This is a fucking joke. If miners unilaterally decide decide to fork to a different implementation than the rest of the network, that will kill Bitcoin. If this actually happens, I hope you guys are proud of yourselves when everything collapses on itself.

Hearn's piece supports /u/Twisted_word's statement: the Bitcoin-network *will* collapse if the miners unilaterally change to a new implementation. Hard forks are decided on by the so-called economic majority, not miners, so his statement is as true as it comes. Read these excellent pieces by Emin Gün Sirer:

Oh, no.  Don't use that.  [Corexit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corexit) is that nasty dispersant they spray on offshore oil spills.  There's probably a shit ton of it still sitting on the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico after the Horizon spill.  They just pronounce it differently co-rex-it (corrects it).
It also shows the miners that they will make more money from both ends, more transactions and a higher price.
"Corexit.. ""Corrects It"".. My God."

Classic doesn't support segwit though. (will? Maybe. Preferably  Not in  the current form, which WILL get activated and force classic support) 
[deleted]
may be the start of a beautiful thing...
I'm gonna turn on my miners again just to support this. 
"These guys have been all talk & no action for many months now. I'll happily change my tune if they would actually... you know... *do something* instead of writing angry letters.

Man up and make the switch for heaven's sake. If the result is such a disaster (how, I have no idea), by all means switch back to the Core implementation. However, with 99% probability, the fallout will amount to nothing. It will bring active benefits too by humbling the Blockstream junta. Greg, Adam, Luke & company are worried because once they lose their grip on the miners, no one will ever trust or go near them again."
"Holy shit!!

If true that was be awesome!"
Holy crap, I might have to think about buying bitcoin again.
"Is there _any_ information about who's behind this? 

Is there any indication that this is NOT a random user who just post these claims without any support from miners?"
"If I read this correctly, pools and miners representing >75% hash power had a meeting. They decided to designate one pool (not disclosed which, referred to as ""pool xx"") as Terminator. Participating miners except the Terminator will switch to Classic within 30 days. When the Classic hash power exceeds 75%, the Terminator pool will switch as well, immediately bringing total Classic support to >90%, essentially killing off the Core chain and preventing a split chain.

Note that this means outside support is still required. The Terminator pool is part of the >75% represented in the meeting, but won't switch until 75% are reached without the Terminator. That means any pool in the world with >10% hash power can veto the change.

I'd really like to know who signed on to this and how reliable this post is. Would take it with a grain of salt until confirmed by known pool representatives."
This is important.

Miners should not decide what bitcoin should look like...We all should...And right now, not all of us want hardfork to 2MB, so this change would be very controversial and thus wrong...we have DAO and ETH for controversial changes and forks, Bitcoin should be better than that after 7 years!

We can't afford to sit at 2MB blocks for the next four years. Ideally there would be another hard fork within a few months to either Bitcoin Unlimited or adaptive blocksize.
That is actually the most sane thing I have ever heard
Well there shouldn't be any block size cap to begin with.  Let the free market sort out appropriate block sizes, there's no reason to artificially limit it anymore.
It does not strike me as reasonable that there should be a block size cap at all, as such.
Looks like it.

That's the opposite of what Bitcoin unlimited does. BU gives the power to economic dependent nodes, miners need to fall in line with whatever they decide.

"This is because I believe Core will drag its feet in releasing SegWit.

Their best solution would be to agree on a date; if Core ""individuals"" do not release the code they promised and/or Core do not release SegWit HF, they proceed to HF with Classic (or whatever they choose to follow).

I know that I have you tagged as a borgstream shill.
but ... but ... drama?
Yeah who is this guy? 
Is it true that Unlimited is best as a node client? While Classic services miners better, as it creates more predictability than Unlimited would? 
Is unlimited still being maintained? Does it have segwit?
Agreed. Show me the hash. 
if its 75% of the hashrate then f2pool and antpool for sure
I can see it.
it confirm this must be good news !
Because Bitcoin miners have nothing to do with Bitcoin!
"Can't wait to see what happens in TheymosLand™ if Classic or Unlimited actually gets adopted by miners.

Will every post there be censored? According to Theymos, at that point ""Bitcoin"" won't be bitcoin."
Bifurcation by the mineral pools. 
Shouldn't require a hard fork.

**HELL YEAH !**

https://i.imgur.com/thhyYae.gif"
This is gentlemen.  Both sides have partial victory, remember that we started at 20MB? Shit so much has happened I can't even remember.  This strikes a good balance.  The downside is we don't get data for each in a vacuum, oh well, let's moon now.
It strikes me as reasonable that the block size should increase with every halving. 
Is this already banned on r/Bitcoin ?
"yada yada yada

mine classic blocks or GTFO"
Way to go miners. I've got my BU node waiting for larger blocks for a while now.
Peter Todd said on Twitter this is a hoax.
this is why everyone should just run unlimited the only people who should be deciding block size should be the miners
I've heard that before
It is wrong for this not to be on /r/bitcoin.
"2M hard bifurcation! (love google translate ;)"
I hope, but I'll believe it when I see it.
So miners decided to grow some balls? I'll believe it when I'll see the hashrate. 
If I understand the Google translation correctly, the 2nd prerequisite is that want Classic to release a new version that includes Segwit and the 2MB increase.  It could be a while to code, test and roll this out yet.
Who exactly is revolting? I see a proposal by someone I don't know.
Is there any evidence this is anything but talk?  What actions would we see to indicate that this is occurring?
"I'm skeptical

who's this round-eye Tom Ebel and why hasn't he spoken up to the west if this is more than a random proposal?

edit: reading the google translate of the responses in that thread, this totally looks like a discussion about a proposal"
Doesn't surprise me. They would have bankrupted themselves running Core. This is a pure business decision that keeps them relevant in the mining game. The best thing for BTC of course would be Unlimited.
"Bitcoin miners forcing decentralization of development = new price $10K.

Development capture is the one thing that could hold Bitcoin back.

When we demonstrate that Bitcoin *cannot* be captured by a development bloc, we have demonstrated something truly wonderful, methinks."
I will believe only when I will see the blockchain flooded with Classic or Unlimited blocks. Chinese miners have no balls.
**Who is the OP?**
"I see no miner announcement.
It looks more like some unknown persons proposal or BS."
"I believe it when I see it. This is so far only stern words. A >1MB block on the network, ok.

Anything else is cheap talk. And we had waay too much of that already. 
"
Talk is cheap.
Can anyone say who is on board with this plan?
No longer a cross-post, deleted from /r/Bitcoin.
"According to the Chinese translation, summary:

1. Core defaulted on HK consensus and doesn't honor 2M increase.

2. Chinese miners to unite to implement Classic which supports 2M increase and SegWit

3. Urge all miners to unite to support the Terminator Plan - ( i think it implies to terminate Core's 0.13.1 which doesn't honor HK consensus).

This is truly a war by miners against CORE."

Expansion of the dispute ""Terminator Plan"" proposal 
38 3324 2016-6-30 11:36:38

Posts by water, no soul in 2016-6-30 11:38 edit


Prerequisites:
1, core version 0.13.1 released in July, including the miners activated segwit (isolation witness) are available;
2, classic releases new version is based on core 0.13.1 version, including for miners active segwit (isolation witness) and 2M hard bifurcation;
3, core violation of the Hong Kong expansion consensus agreement, not in August 1, 2016 release includes new versions of 2M hard bifurcation.


Making process:
1, over 75% of the mine pool owners and operators of power miners Optional Optional day expansion of convening the meeting;
2, the meeting reached a consensus: all participants ore miners in pools or expansion route choice will work hand in hand;
3, select a pool of mine as ""Terminator"";
4, released ""Terminator Plan"" content.

Program content:
1. Participating mineral pool, miners reach consensus on expansion: 90% or more operators to activate 2M force bifurcation hard to count more than 95% of the force activation segwit (isolation witness);
2. Participating mineral pool, miners to achieve consensus on the expansion, will be unified planning, unified action, act in unison;
3, select XX meeting mine pool to ""Terminator"";
4, in addition to the ""Terminator"", the participants all mineral pools, within 30 days the miners core program switches to the latest version of the classic, complete 2M hard bifurcation, segwit (isolation witness) Operator support force;
5, if and only if more than 75% of the operator support 2M hard on finalizing the diverging after ""Terminator"" complete support for 2M hard bifurcation as soon as possible to ensure that there are more than 90% of the force operator support 2M hard bifurcation;
6, when the 2M hard fork is activated, the 28-day grace period, the pool of participants ore miners will do everything possible to inform all the miners, exchanges, wallet developer / company, core wallet users, other start-up companies and other completed core switching procedures to ensure the smooth progress of the bifurcation hard, to avoid unnecessary losses generated;
7, activate segwit (isolation witness).






Description proposal:
1. The proposed plan is valid only after three preconditions occur;
2, which is a majority of the miners to mine the main pool of the proposal, there are different opinions may ignore this proposal, will be idle, bored when I was nonsense;
3, expansion of the dispute has been debated for too long, both parties after a long discussion over, except for a few extreme person, most people agree that the following points:
(1) We need to 2M hard bifurcation, but requires enough force to support the operator to ensure that Bitcoin will not be split;
(2) We need to isolate the witness, in order to achieve Bitcoin kernel better scalability and compatibility;
(3) We need lightning network, in order to achieve Bitcoin-second transfer capability.
4. Select the Always use classic classic does not mean that later, if the core in a subsequent compatible version adds support for the classic, the miners can then select the core;
5, core and classic are open source projects, developers fate is freedom, when the miners selected classic, I believe there will be many core developers turn to classic provides code;
6, the battle line expansion, isolation witness, 2M hard bifurcation debate lightning network has been trouble for too long, please do not argue with me here their advantages and disadvantages, and I do not want to waste time on these topics and the energy;
7, one of the core design of bitcoin miner is considered the future direction of the force decided to Bitcoin, ""talk harm the country"", the expansion of the dispute has been debated for too long, continue to argue it is empty. ""Hard work and prosperous,"" better than a perfect plan executed powerful miners was time to act to end this dispute it!

"Hope this will become true

"So...is this it? Have we won?

The goal was to get the Chinese miners, which represent most of the hashing power currently on the network, to adopt and run Classic. It appears that this is what this post means.

Should I start blowing up balloons?"
finallly
Is this for real or a hoax? Which miners have agreed to this?
Totally irresponsible that this is censored over at the other subreddit. If potential forks are censored doesnt that put the whole project at risk? 
They could only be misled so long. If this really happens this will big step in the right direction.
Wish this was to a scalable block size rather than just 2MB.
i'm wanting that to happen so hard, to finally see back of adam back and other nwo crew which only mission is to destroy bitcoin.

Censored on /r/bitcoin??? Who would have thought?
I guess BlockstreamCore will need a few more $75M to continue trying to prevent Bitcoin from happening.
[deleted]
while they are at it why bother limiting Bitcoin to 2MB why not jump to 8MB or 20 for that matter. 
Chineese miners were always pointed to as a major reason for 1Mb blocks. Now it looks like they'll be a major reason we no longer have them. Either way, China is a major player, and this seems like another reminder.
This is great news!! Do it Jihan!!
From the rough Google Translation of the initial post, it seems to me this is more of a proposal. Have any mining pools actually signed off on this yet?
Meanwhile, total information blackout on the other sub.
Core will threaten to change the proof of work - but I think that would only speed up the switch over to Classic.
Appears to be a hoax.
Classic takes a month to activate after 750/1000 blocks are mined. If all miners switched to it today it wouldn't activate until August. 
"If you want to say O(n^(2)) instead of O(n^2), put parentheses around the exponent, like this:

"Its funny how small blockers change their tone when things did not go their way.

"They were not there representing core, they were there representing Blockstream - that was made clear because Adam tried to change the signature line and got his hand slapped so he changed it back to ""CEO Blockstream""."
"It takes me 30 minutes to sync with the git repository and compile new code on my Odroid node.

I would do it in a heartbeat if we saw a 2MB block size (I'd prefer 8) and hard forked segwit done cleanly without the gregonomic discount."

"Different culture and different memes need to spread to influence them.

They were willing to work with core, to give them the benefit of being the incumbent and taking their concerns seriously.

The public rebuke of the HK by core members would have deeply offended many of them , Greg's statements shamed them publicly as fools and that is literally the worst thing they could have done.

yeah post seems like total BS, and people here are thinking it is real (edit: post itself I think just 'urges' miners to implement this random terminator plan, but no indication that any miners actually met to discuss this. so it is just some random guy posting what he wants miners to do).
Segwit can be rebased on a 2 MB hard fork.
">not all of us want hardfork to 2MB, so this change would be very controversial and thus wrong

So, do you want a +99% agreement threshold then?"
4 MB of full blocks would be too large at the current status of adoption, agreed. But we'd be way below 2 MB at this point even if the blocks were open.
"You're in denial.

After that, you can expect anger, bargaining, depression and finally acceptance."
"""...economic dependent...needs to fall in line"" <-- found the authoritarian"
miners should be deciding, block size limit should be lifted completely and it is a decision for the miners
Remains yet to be seen, but by all accounts it's not a hoax.

Miners were always in charge and will always be and it's in their best self interest to best serve the market, not a bunch of sociopath devs. 
I bet you get tagged 'sockpuppet' a lot.
Don't know about 'best' for you. BU is best for me, so that's what I run. I wish more would.
No, but some may market it that way.  If classic we'll have to go thru this entire pain again to get off of 2mb in a year or so.  With BU block size is no longer consensus critical. 
Been tagged as FUD. hahaha
"Yes, still maintained (probably going to come out with a rebase onto latest Core soon).

No, it doesn't have SegWit - there will need to be a vote on that."
that was the 2nd one. which just got deleted. 3rd will probably pop up soon
/bitcoin may just become dying place where less and less people will visit... just like Church where I live. On the trend start to abandon something it's extremely hard to reversed...
Gone!
No then core would be the altcoin and he will have to censor posts the are NOT about classic. 
He should sell it and move on.
"We're goin to lose more relay and validation nodes with SegWit.

Research on node propagation through the Great Fire Wall of China using Xthin that's been implemented and up and running on Bitcoin Unlimited suggests if their was demand for a 20MB block it would cause a problem.

It's worth noting that until now it hasn't been the hard limit that's determined block size and it's not doing what Core developers think it's doing."
Maybe /r/bitcoin will become the last bastion of the One True Bitcoin rebellion against the Big Block Usurpers, with theymos rallying support for the brave warriors of Core who in a heroic effort will get the chain forked to 1mb blocks again, once again preserving the future of bitcoin for real people, who run the real bitcoin on real raspberry pi's on a wireless ISP somewhere in the boonies
"""No more Core discussion because it requires hard fork against overwhelming consensus"""
If it is unilateral the fork won't work.
Aww, look who's bitter. 
sounds like someones salty about losing money if bitcoin becomes more technologically sound. im guessing you would be all for it if you weren't holding any corecoins
Found the guy that doesn't understand how a hard fork works.
Agreed. Miners CANNOT determine what occurs in a hard fork. If that were the case, ask yourself then why all the miners don't get together and simply activate a fork that gives them 100 bitcoins as a block reward? The nodes will reject those transactions as invalid. Miners thinking they can 'impose' a hardfork is NOT how bitcoin is supposed to work.
"At this point, as far as I'm concerned this is just a rumor.
Until verified, it could be some kid doing it for the lulz and if so, he succeeded. Price is up 5% on what is still just an unverified rumor. That's almost **half a billion dollars** in market cap. If this proves to be untrue, it shows the BTC price is too susceptible to manipulation.

"
Why Classic didn't have a 90%+ threshold to begin with rather than having miners do this, is beyond me
Well, no one could argue that they didn't try literally everything to prevent this..
If that's what it sound like they're doing it without a grace period, which, like Core's soft forks, puts pressure on other miners to upgrade, because the last 10% to upgrade is going to get their blocks orphaned, and nobody wants that to be them.
Or the top 3 miners aren't selling coin today... to promote their silly idea.

I will belive, when I see 75% of classic blocks. Until then it's just a rumor
Perhaps themes of unity would be more appropriate right now.  Don't mean to be a downer, but if this development is true we really need the community to come together.  Not a good time for one side to spike the football in the end zone.
Miners have gathered and agreed by a super majority to switch to classic because Core devs failed to meet the HK agreement. It means we'll get 2 mb blocks soon enough. 
Hard Forks are hard to do. 2MB is hardly a solution. If you think it's a problem soft fork the network down to 2MB after Moving it from the consensus layer.
I know I'm realy short on popcorn now what with the meltdown of the Uk political parties as well.
Corexit
"No.  I'll believe this when they actually start mining blocks.

Even if they wanted to start mining blocks immediately, it's not a simple procedure.  These are multimillion dollar businesses and losing just one block to a bug costs the owner a car.  It's going to take some time before we see the outcome of this."
because this is total bollocks drawn from one post by a nobody?
Because important conversations only happen in English on reddit (specifically /r/Bitcoin), right? Because only your ideas matter right? 
I believe they honestly believe in their business model which doesn't like 2 MB blocksize limit.
I dunno, really? Would I destroy the btc network for $1MM? $100MM? At some point  probably. I get paid and another crypto would take its place, so it seems like a win win. 
and you're blind. don't you see how much money is involved with bitcoin suffocation policy. and it's paid by whom?
"> which only mission is to destroy bitcoin

you are crazy"
Come on - not the time to be divisive.  They honestly believe their solution is best.
How I miss year innocent
"2MB base size means a potential 8M max block size once SegWit activate. 

I don't mind going beyond that but no current implementations (not even Core's SegWit) have solved the O(n^(2)) hashing issue, though.
 
edit: fix big O notation, thanks /u/ShatosiMakanoto"
"Ask the Cornell researchers - they are the *only* ones who have done any research on centralization impacts from a blocksize limit change, even though core goes on about it so much and that's clearly the market classic needs to convince. 

They determined that 4mb was too large, at which point you'd lose nodes. However, they didn't take into account the opportunity of all potentially new nodes operating if price rises and businesses and new users start running them. 

But that's the reason why not 20mb."
"That's all the more reason why we need code that does *not* hard-code some stupid ""max blocksize"".

Having a hard-coded ""max blocksize"" makes the code fragile.

"
"I agree, but if they fork at all it will set a precedent that will make it easier to fork in the future. Blockstream is/was the last gasp of usury-capitalism. 

Let us not mourn the corpse of Mammon! Instead, let us watch it turn to fungus and flowers! "
Assuming this is even true, the motivation will be to take a proven and stable codebase (Classic) rather than try something else new. Chinese miners have proven themselves quite conservative in the past.
Morally wrong.
Your mom's an idiot.
A turning point.
"Incorrect. 

[btcd's implementation of segwit caches the hashing mid-state, eliminating the n^2 `SigHashAll` hashing complexity](https://github.com/btcsuite/btcd/pull/656/commits/7710001863f99f5b43ae48c1767c9781bb55f5a7). We call it the [""HashCache""](https://github.com/Roasbeef/btcd/blob/segwit-final/txscript/hashcache.go) (credit goes to Tadge for the name). 

I was speaking to the author of [bcoin](https://github.com/bcoin-org/bcoin) the other night, and he informed me that he has also implemented a similar data structure.

[Bitcoin Core has a pull request which is being reviewed that implements hash caching](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8259). 

EDIT: add bcoin

EDIT^2: typo fix"
so blockstream core would just need to create a pool with > 10% of the hash to block. terminated.
If the Terminator is a pool, people could switch away from it to reach 75% sooner.
"the terminator pool would have about 15% right? So that would be either:

- antpool
- f2pool
- bw.com
- BTCC 

If they want to have 75% before the terminator pool trigger, all of the other would have to join in... so the only one not participating is probably the terminator pool..."
"Nice plan :)  That's what you get for underestimating the Chinese.

I think Core are reaping what they have sown here."
"Did not hear you saying that when Blockstream hijack bitcoin. 

Crying wolf much?"
"They already have.

In 30 days, you will see a change."
ummm. they are and should be acting in their own interest. whether that is long-term or short-term interest is up to them.  
"Actually, they also care about Bitcoin, Bitcoin's users, Bitcoin businesses and the approach that wants bitcoin to be ELECTRONIC CASH without middlemen. Check the white paper. It's the first sentence.

Edit: a settlement network just for Blockstream is the selfish path."
Dipshits are the Blockstream gang. This is the best chance bitcoin have to survive. 
"you and I will be miners in the foreseeable future, thanks to commodization.

the blocksize was always in the hands of the miners."
Yeh look haw bad it's crashing.  Oh no please don't go up any more!
