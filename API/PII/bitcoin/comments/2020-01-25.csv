No, it's a way bad people trick you out of your money.

You should only consider mining if you have access to *extremely* cheap electricity, somewhere to put hot & very noisy ASICs, and a decent grasp of the technical requirements. If you are missing any one of these, you will just lose money.

"An address is either a hashed public key or a hashed script (presented with a checksum in a textual form). Each public key is generated from a distinct private key. (`Q = d x G`), where `Q` is the public key, `d` is the private key and `G` is the generator point of the elliptic curve. `x` here means elliptic curve multiplication.

Each private key `d` is essentially a 256-bit random scalar. Your wallet needs to store each private key it uses, or be able to regenerate them deterministically. The public keys can always be regenerated from the private key, but they're usually cached by the wallet too.

The deterministic approach for key generation usually follows [BIP32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki), where a single *master* private key and chaining key are remembered, and from this, a hierarchy containing any number of other keys can be generated using a deterministic key derivation function.

In terms of linkage. The public keys are usually entirely distinct and cannot be matched up by an observer, but BIP32 supports a form of ""unhardened"" public keys, which allows anybody knowing the public key and chaining key (known as the xpub) for a parent public key can themselves regenerate all of the child public keys of that parent. This is designed so that some accounts can be auditable without revealing private keys.

Aside from the actual keys themselves, the usual way that addresses can be linked is when multiple UTXOs are used in a single spend - and an observer can assume they belong to the same person, although this is not necessarily true - and also they can usually assume one of the outputs of a transaction are *change* addresses, and use it to probabilistically trace your transaction activity if they're able to link some other keys to your identity. There's no easy way to fix this - but coin mixing techniques can make it difficult for observers to trace your activity if the anonymity set of the mixes are sufficient.";2;0;False;WittyStick;ffj0f4s;Technical (but in english) explanation of addresses?;etwdye;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/etwdye/technical_but_in_english_explanation_of_addresses/
"No, the addresses cannot be linked just by examining the addresses themselves. However, your use will most likely reveal which addresses belong to you as the transactions are all public and chain analysis companies have gotten quite good. And the moment one address is linked to you, most will get linked to you as well.

This is even more true if you don't use your own node. In that case you pretty much tell the wallet devs which addresses belong to you.

It's a long story, but bottom line is don't use bitcoin for illegal shit thinking it's anonymous, it's not. If you want to learn privacy on bitcoin, learn to run your own node (like Bitcoin Core), get a mixing wallet, say Wasabi, and learn coin control!

"Valid questions, and valid goal to use BTC like Cash.

Yes, the addresses you're using are generated from that wallet; someone once did the numbers on it and an accidental address collision is a Once-in-39-billion-years-event (that's almost ten times the age of earth in scientific view and about six million times from ""First day"" to ""Now"" in fundamental christian view). Chances are that if you're struck by lightning twice within five minutes and score the lotto jackpot two months in a row, you might want to think about moving all your funds to new addresses ;)

If using the major wallet apps right, you're not going to expose your other 39 addresses by using one address, yet you might want to read up on the Dusting Attack - in a nutshell: People trying to link Bitcoin addresses send tiny (real tiny) amounts of Satoshis to active addresses to see if someone uses these ""unspent amounts"" to bundle up for one bigger transaction -> [http://www.publish0x.de/cobo-vault/everything-you-need-know-about-dusting-attack-xmrkym?a=joQeZJepZV](https://www.publish0x.com/cobo-vault/everything-you-need-know-about-dusting-attack-xmrkym?a=joQeZJepZV)";1;0;False;PapaAlpaka;ffj110i;Technical (but in english) explanation of addresses?;etwdye;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/etwdye/technical_but_in_english_explanation_of_addresses/
"The one-way nature of sha256 hashing ensures addresses are not linked to each other even within a single wallet. But - your use of addresses can link them together. When you spend a ""coin"" it must be fully used and so the remainder (""change"") is spent back to your own wallet (usually on a new address). By tracking these change values and when they get spent in another transaction analysis can associate addresses and combine them into a ""view"" of a wallet. There are various techniques you can use to minimize this. You also add identity info during many use cases - like when you buy/sell on an exchange, or when having items shipped to you or with online account info.

"> where fees are less and there’s no hold on your bitcoin for x amount of time.

Well, assuming your in the US, the holds are really a product of our banking system.  If you ACH money to an exchange, the transfer is usually free, but 100% reversible by you, basically forever.  This puts all the risk of getting ripped off on the exchange.  The hold is there to ensure that your not trying to issue a charge-back.  Although ACH txns can be reversed forever, most banks make it harder if funds have settled for a few weeks.  The exchange actually gets the money the very next day.

If you use a wire (FedWire) these are much more difficult for you to reverse and represent much less risk to the exchange.  All that being said, if your only buying $200 your cheapest option would be to use a FedWire to Gemini and pay the $0.50 transaction fee.  The wire-in and BTC withdraw are both free(ish).  If you use a ""modern"" bank like Fidelity, your outbound wires are free as well.

Binance is cheaper to buy, but has a $4 withdraw fee.  Kraken is also cheaper, but has a $5 deposit fee and a $4 withdraw fee.  So Gemini is probably your best bet.

KYC Exchange Buy/Sell (maker) fees:

* r/Binance - 0.10% + 0.0005 BTC withdraw fee
* r/Kraken - 0.16% + 0.0005 BTC withdraw fee
* r/Gemini - 0.25% + 10 FREE BTC withdraws (quoted fee requires ""ActiveTrader)
* r/Coinbase - 0.50% + FREE BTC withdraw (quoted fee requires ""Pro"")
* r/CashApp - 1.8% + FREE BTC withdraw

I'm not following your logic here.

Which may not have anything to do with whether the hardware wallet is closed or open source, since you can just swap the pcb board for his custom board with preloaded cloned but malicious firmware.

"you could argue reverse engineering and finding a usable exploit in a closed source product is an order of magnitude more complex then reverse engineering a open source wallet, as there is no map with a closed source product.

It's the difference between hiking through a forest without a map or with a map.

Actually the concept of the blockchain isn't new, but private companies wouldn't see the necessity for such a data structure. If there should be a revolution, it would have to come from the legal side - if the laws would *require* that such a data structure would be used to ensure immutability. Whereas a complete chronological accounting is already a legal requirement basically everywhere, there's no obligation yet to use a certain data structure.

"I know this isn't the popular opinion.  But, my advice to people that want that level of ease, and are willing to trade away owning their own keys for it, is to store them with someone regulated that will pay them interest.  Though they should definitely do so knowing what that means.  Why would I keep my coin with Gemini or Coinbase when I can transfer them over to Celsius or BlockFi (which have insurance, store with regulated custodians, and do over-collateralized lending) so I get interest?

I keep a percentage of my BTC this way for 2 reason.  

1)  I have been in IT for over 2 decades and, even though I know I am better than 99.999% of people at holding my own keys, I don't ever %100 trust myself.  Having some Bitcoin that is outside the reach of my own natural human stupidity and can only be moved by proving my identity to a trusted 3rd party has some value to me on it's own.

2)  I want the companies that are building the bridges to traditional finance to succeed, so why not try out the financial products of the companies that are going through the trouble of building those bridges when it is a service that you find useful?

&#x200B;

I would never recommend keeping more than half your BTC this way (and even then would want it spread through the few trustworthy ones I find), but it's way better to me than parking it on an exchange because you don't want to deal with the techie side (ie. a hardware wallet and private seed phrase), especially if that tech side feels way too difficult and you don't have enough time to really educate yourself or enough coin to make a hardware wallet worth it.  Not your keys not your coins, doesn't mean that you never extend trust to anyone else ever.

"Keeping your bitcoin or other cryptocurrency on an exchange like Coinbase is fine for small amounts or if you plan on trading with it/selling soon. But if you want to have complete control over your bitcoin, you will need to withdraw to a wallet where you own the private keys that store your bitcoin. These wallets are called “non-custodial” wallets because there is no custodian (middle-man) holding your money for you. 


Non-custodial wallets provide you with a 12 or 24 word “seed phrase” that acts as a backup for your entire wallet. Good choices for wallets can be found at https://bitcoin.org , and if you ever need to recover your wallet in a different wallet app/program, go to https://walletsrecovery.org for assistance if it doesn’t work the way you expect it to.

Wallet apps are available for Windows, Mac, and Linux PCs as well as iPhone and Android devices. There are even dedicated cryptocurrency storage devices called “Hardware” wallets.

"That would work but keep in mind the seed words that you are presented when setting up the wallet are all that’s needed to access your funds.

If those are compromised (due to your Opsec being bad) then your money is also at risk.

The best solution is either to become technically proficient enough to use an air gapped live boot Linux environment and create your wallet/seed that way, or just buy a trezor or ledger hardware wallet.

Hardware wallets plug into your normal computer and have a secure chip from which the seed cannot be pulled off of, but will provide you with the seed directly.

Again in all situations it’s important to realize that if you are taking custody of your coins, the seed is the key to them. If that gets compromised, your funds are as well.";2;0;False;ElephantGlue;ffik21w;I had bought BTC last year and set up an acct?wallet? On Coinbase.

Oh one more final piece of advice. You are far better served asking these sorts of questions to a tax professional, in person or on the phone only. Tax evasion is almost 100% about criminal intent. Forgetting or not understanding the tax code happens and you generally pay a penalty and what you owe. Intentionally misreporting elevates it to crime and you do not want to fuck with that.

"What you are suggesting is entirely illegal, just want to be clear. You are not allowed to try and hide the transactions. In fact doing many small transactions is probably worse because it will make calculating taxes extremely difficult.

"The real take away from this, that I think that not everyone commenting on this post gets, is that this creates competition between countries.

You can now get on a plane and take it to Croatia, go through customs with your empty, factory reset phone, download your wallet once you are there and start converting your Bitcoin to local currency.  Not sure about the fees, but it may be cheaper than converting USD into local currency.

What's more, if you have $10 in BTC or $10million in BTC you can take it with you without customs and border patrol hassling you about it, and fuck banks and bank fees.  The government does not want me taking my gold, or tens of thousands of dollars of my dollars across a border.  No problem.  I won't need to when it is on the Internet.

If Croatia has made this easy and without limits or with high limits, then this is attractive to people who want to go to Croatia for work or leisure or tourism.

Even socialist and communist countries like to compete with other countries for world wide money and rich travelers.

To anyone who has had to enter the US or another country and go through their customs searches, or wire money, or sent money to another country or exchanged one currency for another, you know what a violation feels like, and with this method, done right, is smart and competitive.

Other countries similar to Croatia will be doing the same thing just to stay competitive.

"You're probably best served by looking up some youtube videos on how bitcoin mining works.

The real thing to understand is how a hash function works. 

The answer to your question is that the mathematical problem consists of taking a bunch of unconfirmed transactions from the mempool, and building them into a block, according to the bitcoin rules.

Then, a random number is added to the block before it is hashed. In order for the block to be valid, the result of the hash has to contain a certain number of zeros at the beginning, which is determined by the difficulty that bitcoin mining is set to by the network.

If the required number of leading zeros is insufficient, then the block is not valid, and the miner has to repeat the process again using a different random number. That random number is called a nonce btw.

This process repeats trillions of times until a miner finds the unique combination of transactions built into the block, and the nonce to create a hash of that block that contains the required number of leading zeroes.";26;0;False;LiveCat6;ffi0p6f;Where do miners get the problems that they solve?;etquy5;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/etquy5/where_do_miners_get_the_problems_that_they_solve/

"No. Not a random number.

They take all the pending transactions they know about package them up into a block, add a number to that(called a [nonce](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Nonce)) then run that block of data through an algorithm( called double sha256 [hash function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function)).

-the format includes the hash of the last block

-the format includes some fields, which are called nonces, that can be set arbitrarily

Roughly:

* people spend Bitcoin, their wallets broadcast 'transactions'
* miners listen for those transactions and keep a list of them
* each miner creates a 'block' of new transactions (a few thousand transactions)
* the miner adds a timestamp, the 'id number' of the previous block (no matter who mined it), and then guesses a 'lucky number' and adds that to his new block
* the miner runs his new block through a **cryptographic hash function**, which  'crunches' the block down from millions of ones and zeroes into a string of just 256 ones and zeroes
* the 256 bits represent a whole number (0, 1, 2, ..); if that number is less than the current difficulty target, the miner 'wins' -- that miner has 'solved the math problem'
* typically, the result of the hash function is greater than the target; the miner updates the timestamp, guesses another 'lucky number' then tries again, and again...
* the target number is low enough that it takes all the miners in the world working as fast as they can about ten minutes (on average) until one of them gets lucky and 'wins'";9;2;False;Mark_Bear;ffi1pbc;Where do miners get the problems that they solve?;etquy5;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/etquy5/where_do_miners_get_the_problems_that_they_solve/
"You're thinking there's a set problem with one answer. That's not how it works. 

It's a set of rules and anything that follows the rule is a solution.

The rules that pertain to mining are just that the block contents have to hash to a value with a certain amount of leading zeros. (The exact number of zeros is determined by difficulty, which is calculated by looking at previous blocks). Hash values are completely unpredictable, so getting any amount of leading zeros is just luck. For example only 1 in 256 will have two leading zeros (in hex). Only 1 in 65536 will have 4 etc. It follows that if you have ten leading zeros, you must have tried a lot of times before you found it, hence it's proof you did a lot of work.";5;1;False;jmw74;ffi51ut;Where do miners get the problems that they solve?;etquy5;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/etquy5/where_do_miners_get_the_problems_that_they_solve/

"> Why isn't the process reversed in some way where the receiving wallet can control the fee?

Technically, that is an option to you.

it's called ""child pays for parent"" (CPFP) fee bumping.

If you send a transaction and the fee was too low, you can spend the ""change"" transaction but double up the fee required. This will cause the miners to look at both transactions as a set, and the combined fees should then be high enough to get both confirmed.  CPFP also can be done if you are the recipient of the funds.

"It sounds like badly designed wallet software is your issue. If you're not seeing an easy way to send all w/fee then I agree it's a problem.

The idea for receiving wallet to control the fee is just not compatible with how Bitcoin works. The protocol itself doesn't even have a concept of wallets. The fee has to come out of the inputs to the transaction. Although as someone else mentioned, ""child pays for parent"" could be considered an approximation to what you're talking about since it does allow the receiver to contribute extra fees if the original is too low.

A standard approach for how merchants use Bitcoin is still (IMHO) an immature space but they certainly \*can\* opt to do it basically how you suggest if they're willing to subtract the fee from their cut.

I never said doomsday anything. The current economic system based on borrowing is broken. centralized economies are broken. You see more credit card commercials than anything. They don’t want you saving and investing they want you borrowing because that’s how they make money. So much emphasis on credit scores now a days but what does that mean? You’re good at owing the bank money, you’re good at paying the bank back on time. Borrowing wouldn’t be necessary if the wealth gap wasn’t so huge, it wouldn’t be necessary if we weren’t payed near the same minimum wage as decades ago when the cost of living was half. Bitcoin wouldn’t be necessary if there wasn’t an upper class that preyed on the lower and middle classes and try to make everyone as poor as possible while getting as rich as possible... and doing it in a way that you thank them for doing it and then go around shilling their system that has been designed to oppress you. So many people I know in debt with credit cards or other loans won’t get them paid off until their 40s and finally start saving for retirement, because they were lied to and told it was more important to have a good credit score than it is to find financial independence and put away your money for the long term.;2;0;False;RondyDoneDidit;ffioexs;Tick!

"Its interesting to me that so many people think of Bitcoin as digital ""cash"" - when I came into the space I never thought of it like this. I think dollars (digital/paper/whatever) work fine in all aspects but scarcity. Like, if you're storing dollars for the next month to buy coffee, use fiat. If you're storing it for the next decade to retire, use Bitcoin. I came into it from the perspective that its the first thing ever where, if humans want more of it, too bad. We can build more mansions, we can mine more gold, we can start more companies. But if you want space on the blockchain you gotta buy it, at whatever rate the market lets you. Whoa. 


So many people buy stocks and bonds and houses in London and all kinds of nonsense just to store their wealth and keep it safe from inflation. I think Bitcoin is going to soak up a tremendous amount of that kind of investment just from the perspective of scarcity.


The whole prospect kind of fails if there are a bunch of competitors though. I think this is the most logical argument against it, that you can ""just make up another Bitcoin."" So far I don't buy it. Hash rate matters, adoption matters, brand matters. Lots of similar arguments for gold even though platinum is scarcer. I think the next big test will be when the fees get high again. Does Bitcoin push through with people moving to lightning, or do other speculative side chains start to pump? If the second thing I'll probably take profits and watch from the sidelines. If not, its such an obvious hodl outcome. Can't wait to see.";3;1;False;zenethics;ffj08wx;Tick!

"Fiat money is a currency without intrinsic value that has been established as money, often by government regulation. Fiat money does not have use value, and has value only because a government maintains its value, or because parties engaging in exchange agree on its value.[1] It was introduced as an alternative to commodity money and representative money. Commodity money is created from a good, often a precious metal such as gold or silver, which has uses other than as a medium of exchange (such a good is called a commodity). Representative money is similar to fiat money, but it represents a claim on a commodity (which can be redeemed to a greater or lesser extent).[2][3][note 1]

"DO \*NOT\* USE [BITCOIN.DE](https://BITCOIN.DE)

They are a crappy exchange who require you to show them your ID via video chat \[1\]. After that they will know everything about you, including your address, your unique ID number and have a bio-metrical photo of you.

In addition to that they do not hesitate to give out your private data to anyone who is asking them. Even if they are not legally forced to do that \[2\]. Who knows where your data might end up?

Instead I recommend you using an offline ATM like [shitcoins.club](https://shitcoins.club). They own at least one ATM where you can exchange your Euros to BTC and vice versa completely anonymously. If you click on ""locations"" on their website you see a map with all addresses where you can find their exchange machines.

"Here are my beginner tips:

1) The name ""Bitcoin"" isn't trademarked, so there's a lot of fraud out there pretending to be Bitcoin. For example, Bitcoin dot com is a phishing site that attempts to sell something called ""Bitcoin Cash"" which isn't Bitcoin at all.

2) Don't give your private info to any service online associated with Bitcoin. For example, there's a site called Coinbase (also known as Con-base) that happily gave away the user's private data to the government. Avoid those services, and protect yourself from fraud, theft, or even worse.

3) Since the inception of Bitcoin, many scammers have found that a large percentage of people don't care about the principles of Bitcoin and only look at it in terms of ""getting rich"". These scammers have created things called ""Alt coins"" and ""ICOs"" which are essentially scams. Don't fall for the junk. There's plenty of hard evidence why they are junk.

4) Along the lines of scams, a very popular one is where you give someone some Bitcoin in promise of ""doubling your money"" or basically getting back more Bitcoin in return. That is 100% a scam. Don't fall for that either.

5) Treat Bitcoin as a 100% volunteer effort, because it is. Unlike Apple or Google, which has billions of dollars of investment capital, engineers, marketing, and customer service, Bitcoin is more of your uncle's clunky contraption built in a garage. But of course, it's incredibly brilliant and secure if you know what you're doing. It's a challenge to learn though, and you have to be patient with it. It's not like a polished commercial product that's designed for Joe Simpleton to use. That being said, anyone can learn Bitcoin if they have an honest curiosity. You don't need to be a genius or even technically adept. Just willing to be patient and willing to learn.

6) Be skeptical. That is a foundation of Bitcoin - it is build around the idea that you can't trust anyone but yourself. A node is designed to run on your machine, not on others, and mathematically secured such that nobody can perpetrate fraud (if you use it correctly). That is a groundbreaking concept, and it starts with skepticism. Verify the information you get, just like nodes verify mathematically the blockchain information it receives.

7) Use Bitcoin. Play with it, in small, trivial amounts. Try buying something cheap. Try earning some Bitcoin. If you get into Lightning, you'll be able to do this in sub-penny amounts that you don't have to worry about experimenting with large amounts. Play with creating a wallet, making a backup, then destroying the wallet and seeing if you can recover the $0.01 that you had inside. You will learn a lot, from experimenting.

8) Ignore the price talk. A huge chunk of time and money is being wasted on speculation about the price, again, mostly due to greed. There is only one investment strategy you need to know, and that is, to hold long-term, and to buy slowly over time (DCA). You will beat 99.99999% of ""traders"" with this old, boring, time-tested strategy. It's not exciting, you will not get rich overnight, but again, Bitcoin isn't about the price at the end. It has to be useful, to have value.

9) Understand that we're all new to this, because Bitcoin itself is a baby. Again, Bitcoin isn't a commercial product, so it isn't going to reach fast mainstream popularity the way say iPhone or Pokemon Go did. It is more like Linux - slow and steady, a bit technical, free, and secure. And what you learn about it now, someday, you may not even need to know it because it will become so integrated into other things invisibly that it's like how Android phones all over the world are now powered by Linux without people realizing it.

10) Take a break from it every once in a while. Bitcoin is a deep rabbit hole and you need to get some air sometimes. :)";18;1;False;anon517;ffhtomw;How do I start on a good note with Bitcoin?;etnok0;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/etnok0/how_do_i_start_on_a_good_note_with_bitcoin/

"> new to Bitcoin

You should avoid words like ""inevitable"" until you know what you're talking about

> I don't think it's an issue but more of a deliberate design

No, the block size limit was not part of the original design, was added some time later in response to resource overload. It would be more accurate to say that limiting the block size is a necessary part of the design, because of resource constraints

> Doesn't the very design simply suggest a sidechain that serves as a master keychain feeding all downstream nodes

No it does not. The proposal in your paper is centralized. The design of Bitcoin avoids centralization - because we have that already, it's called Visa  

Your paper would have been much shorter if you'd followed a logical track from your Uber demand-pricing analogy. Uber prices increase during high demand, encouraging more supply  
In January 2018, when people were paying $15 transaction fees and waiting 3-10 days for transaction confirmation, there was block space available on Litecoin. Real Bitcoin users (day-to-day spenders, not speculators) switched to Litecoin for 5 weeks and had tiny fees and 5-minute confirmation  
Two years later, Bitcoin's real transaction volume (excluding all the fake volume in the speculation market) is well below 1MB per 10 minutes. If the capacity ever fills up, any user can choose Litecoin

"Thanks for insights. The paper posits the supply constraint leads to this as a consequence. It can be shown mathematically for a price to clear or equilibrate supply must match demand. Supply is fixed, therefore demand must respond. When supply is fixed and demand falls, we move down in price (for transactions that is). That’s the cause and effect mechanism.

"I mean general sentiment that Bitcoin could yield significant gains as a speculative investment.  Let's not kid ourselves.  Most people are in this space to make some money, whether they are expecting to ""cash out"" and convert back to fiat later or to transact with Bitcoin later and ultimately that the money they put into it previously now fetches more value.  The tech is awesome, but you have to face the reality that the prospect of crypto growing your wealth is what draws most people here.  When I said ""the end"" I was talking about a turning point at which somebody concludes ""this is not going to grow my wealth 10x or by X percent in my lifetime, or perhaps ever."" and likely ""I'm pulling out and not coming back"".  We have to accept that our own gains are had by others entering the space, and when we run out of reasons why we will have these parabolic runs up, that brings people to conclude that there isn't enough to entice the crowds that are necessary for us to get those gains.

Also, I have to disagree and I do think there are a lot of people that expect parabolic gains after block reward halving each time, reliably.

"I agree with that. I'm expecting the disappointing result of the halvening to be kind of the final shakeout for this bear market. But it will take 6-12 months for that shakeout to fully take place, since even the halvening hopefuls aren't expecting an immediate surge to ATH's after it occurs. That places the inflection point for a bottom (not necessarily in price, but a bottom for hope) at early 2021. 

It's not out of the wood even at that point. From there I expect quite a long period of meandering despair as the market reconciles with all the failed hope from the last few years. It will probably wobble around throughout 2021 and into early 2022 as those who remain half-heatedly grasp at hope. Self-deprecating holders joke with each other about their delusions for ever getting to ATHs again, going on 4+ years since the last peak now. Things become lighthearted as nobody takes themselves too seriously anymore in the space. But something tells them if they've come this far, they might as well go a little further.

Finally the market picks up steam on a *new* hope. A new storyline. New faces. Optimism is reigned in as it rallies in late 2022.

"> Anyone who's been DCA'ing for at least a couple years is already up in money, even though it's been a bear market. 

I'm not saying DCA isn't a fine approach, but you are still cherry picking. What if someone decided to start DCA'ing 6 months ago?

> It's pretty though to lose money in bitcoin and not so easy to find alternative investment that are as good/better. 

It's hard to find alternatives that *have* been as good. As far as going forward, that's just your opinion. It's very possible that from this point forward, it will be a completely disastrous investment. And it's almost certain to be a volatile one which is inherently bad for people.

> Don't really see a reason for selling. 

People often have unanticipated spending needs. They also get uneasy about the volatility, not realizing how it actually feels to constantly be swinging up and down in value month after month. They also worry about something going wrong with their wallet/backups/custodian and may just not want to think about it anymore. There are certain to be countless other upcoming investment fads that may tempt them, to the point where holding value in a downtrending/flat bitcoin feels like a wasted opportunity.

To all this you probably think ""Well whatever, those people are short-sighted. Those aren't reasons *I'm* going to sell."" Which is all fine and great, but isn't the point of my comment. Whether you agree with the reasons or not, if we go another year without decisive movement up (implying the halvening to be underwhelming as well), a LOT of people will lose patience/faith and give up.";2;2;False;panduh9228;ffi9sv4;Waiting patiently;etiyq7;https://i.redd.it/02e7q9aaftc41.jpg

So I had this realization that when I look at coinbase and see that bitcoin is trading at $8,337 a coin it has a market cap of $151 billion. If somehow bitcoin were to reach roughly $55,000 that would put the market cap at $1 trillion. Just out of curiosity how much do you think that would fuel even more growth assuming the media is talking about it before, and after reaching the trillion dollar mark. That would be a market cap as big as roughly 1/20 or what ever the us national debt is which would be a big deal? Correct me if im wrong but we have been seeing more then double all time high's from time to time? I have been searching to find those charts that sometimes people post with like the year by year all time low or high's. If that were the case, it hit 20k and if it did a bit over double that it hits the trillion cap.

There's nothing you can do to actually stop sim swapping itself from occurring because the issue is a social one. First, good practices are not in place to ensure your identity before switching providers. I experienced this first hand when I swapped providers one time - little information was needed.


Second, the bigger problem is even if good practices are in place, they cannot be guaranteed to be followed by employees who then become the exploit.

"> How to protect yourself from SIM swapping?

1. Simply avoid SMS based 2FA if TOTP (Gauth) or U2P (Security Key) based 2FA are offered.
2. Use a VOIP number so you are not trusting a cellphone provider.

That's about it.  Most of the ""safegaurds"" the cell providers offer are just superficial.  I wouldn't trust them.  If your forced into using SMS based 2FA, simply accept that SIM swapping is a very real risk.  VOIP can help, but then you are just transfering the custodianship from AT&T (\*hiss\*) to Google or Microsoft.  The tech companies may be ""better"" than AT&T, but they are not bullet proof.

The **ONLY** secure 2FA is U2F (security key).";2;0;False;brianddk;ffhkjlk;How to protect yourself from SIM swapping?;eticvd;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/eticvd/how_to_protect_yourself_from_sim_swapping/

"I can recommend no problem using their visa prepaid card if you're resident in the EU since you accumulate sats back on every in store purchase for everything. It works that they give you a EUR account linked to the prepaid visa, you fund that account how much you want by funding it from your standard bank account, and you spend those EUR and they give you sats.

Well ""debit cards"" rely on the very banks that the unbaked were ""un""ed out of.  All bitcoin needs is a smartphone and a cell-data plan.

I agree with you, but it’s a law that all businesses must accept USD to settle debts. I’d argue that if a shop cannot accept my USD cash, then it’s not following that law. This would only apply for settling a debt (restaurant) but not when you prepay for goods (store). I think this is probably one of those “I don’t like government overreach, but it’s not far off from an existing law, so it’s ultimately not hurting, and it doesn’t restrict choices” situation. If it were the opposite, where it expressly allowed shops to reject cash, I wouldn’t be in the same boat, as they’re removing choices/options. That all said, I can definitely see where you’re coming from, and is probably what I’d ultimately prefer. If customers want to pay in cash, they’ll shop elsewhere. If stores want to pay more of their profits in fees, they’ll stop accepting cash.

Not so.  If the banks go down, they will either get bailed in or bailed out.

We could have bail-ins in the US.  Don't kid yourself.  It depends on how far underwater the banks are.  If it's hundreds of billions, sure, maybe they just get bailed out again.  If it's trillions?

As said above, Lebanon has its own currency, but it’s pegged to the USD and the de-facto currency used every day is the USD, printing more money wouldn’t help because the LB lira isn’t worth the paper printed on and the LB central bank used people’s USD deposits (that it borrowed from private banks, paying up to 20% on its bonds sometimes) to maintain the peg and the exchange rate at 1507lb lira/ 1$ for more than 20 yrs. it’s fucked up.

>If a divorce was around the corner her withdraw would be on record and the bank should be able to recoup funds withdrawn under false pretenses.

Why would the bank need to recoup funds? They didn't lose anything... If your former spouce calls up and gives a sad story that convinces a teller, it's not the bank's money that gets handed over, it's yours.

This isn't a hypothetical scenario. It happens all the time, along with dozens of other sorts of low-level personal fraud. As a result there are strong laws in place that prevent banks from permitting access to funds without authorization.

>What is the point of security if it prevents you from accessing your own wealth, especially in a time of need?

It doesn't. You always have access. Even from your deathbed, through those you have designated either through joint account access or a durable power of attorney. The problem comes about when you've made no arrangements as to who can access your funds in the case of your incapacitation.

My (now) husband and I oddly benefited from the fact that we couldn't legally get married when we were younger. We had to set up all of our mutual access to funds, medical proxies, wills, etc. to try to approximate some of the legal protections that marriage affords. But in so doing, we set up many provisions that married couples all too often fail to establish and suffer for.

Once, he was unexpectedly hospitalized and I was able to continue our financial lives as normal. But married couples often discover to their shock that they have funds tied up in accounts that aren't held jointly, only too late.

***What everyone should learn from this***: get to a lawyer when you get married and get all of the details of how you want to deal with your mutual affairs in writing. Medical proxies, living will, etc. Too many couples find out at the worst possible time that they should have done this!";2;0;False;Tyler_Zoro;ffho8yp;Found on another thread.

"Ah, totally didn’t realize it was a credit union! LOL sweet, I’m an ass and was totally making the assumption that OP was talking about a mainstream bank.

To address your point about credit unions - I don’t actually think that’s right. Credit unions are more constrained than larger banks are in what they can provide, but they also don’t nickel and dime the average consumer.

How does somebody come up in a world where every dollar matters, but they *direct deposit* or a high minimum average *daily balance* in order not to get charged the $10-15/month service fee? Even savings accounts aren’t free.

I get that banks are a business, but they make money off of lending many times the deposit amount they have on their books. So they literally make money off of money deposited in the bank and off of fees. The rich person is waived of fees across the board while the poor person bears the cost - service fees, higher interest rates. These things don’t phase the wealthy if they had to pay, but they also don’t have to pay because the bank gives them the perk of no service fees.

At least at a credit union, the accounts are typically free. So even if you’re hurting and have $1 to your name, you can *at least keep your account open.* If you’re at any major bank, you go negative and they eventually close your account if you don’t meet minimums and don’t pay that negative balance after the fee.

Credit unions are less predatory than your typical large bank IMO.

"My renter makes deposits to my account to pay his rent.  Why the fuck would the bank give him access to my money based on that fact?

Also a 30 year marriage does entitle you to some of the money in a divorce, and all of the money when he dies.  But that requires legal settlements, not just begging at a bank.  While he’s alive and not court-ordered to pay his his wife, legally it’s correct to prevent the wife from access to money not in her name.  Otherwise far more marriages will never end in divorce and just the wife emptying the bank account and disappearing.... 

This is a terrible example because it’s not realistic, either the husband is trusting and they have a joint account, or he can just click a button on his bank app on his phone to send money directly to her account, or send a check to any address to pay any bill.

But come up with a one time pad, A.  It's a random sequence of bits (truly random, from a hardware random number generator, or at least a cryptographically strong stream).  So now you can give friend 1 A and friend 2 A XOR P.  Neither has P.  But if they bring their secrets together, they get (A) XOR (A XOR P) and that's P, right?

It won't require user intervention to use; it only needs wallet software that has Taproot support integrated. It is not something that we may discover didn't work, when studied in isolation. We can prove that strictly less information is revealed with this scheme.

"I appreciate your perspective. But I believe there's some form of miscommunications or misunderstanding going on here... Contextual bias implies that it only works ""if...(insert constraints)"" but that would be going against the literal definition of fungibility.

To extrapolate, Merriam Webster lists the following definitions for Fungibility:

1.  being something (such as money or a commodity) of such a nature that one part or quantity may be replaced by another equal part or quantity in paying a debt or settling an account

2. capable of mutual substitution

3. readily changeable to adapt to new situations

(I'm leaving out the secondary section that defines it as a noun because it ultimately isn't applicable to refer to the fungible goods in question literally as ""fungibles"" here...)

This leads me to define it accordingly:

1. Any unit of a specific denomination is worth the same as any similar denomination (AKA, $1 can be exchanged at any time for any other $1 without consequence or loss of value in said transaction. i.e. you and I each trade $1 bills; neither of us lost anything in the trade). Subsequently, any combination of said denomination can be combined or divided (if/when possible) into similarly quantified denominations (AKA, a stack of 20 $1 bills can be exchanged for a $20 bill without loss of value, and vice versa).

2. Honestly, other than reinforcement of the idea that something that is fungible should be completely interchangeable, I cannot decipher why they chose to separate 1 and 2, as they appear to be incredibly similar... Again, I think it's only to emphasize the interchangeable part...

3. Ironically, the definition of fungibility is not flexible; but it is that part which describes that its value must be applicable to any necessary goods. And that the value of said goods must scale properly to the medium of exchange. (AKA, you can buy virtually anything you might need with the denomination. i.e. a gallon of gasoline is sold for $3.49, and a gallon of milk is nigh the same price. As a community, we decided that at minimum wage, someone would have to work approximately a half hour to buy either of those two things. And while we gripe about high costs and whatnot, we still fork over the $3.49 without too much complaining. And the value of what is bought in these transactions scale fairly).

Now, the reason I say that cash and gold are acceptably fungible is because of the following: 

I can walk into a bank with 50 $100 bills and ask for change in only $1 bills. Providing extenuating circumstances don't apply (i.e. they don't have that many $1s on hand...), they will give you 5000 $1 bills. In this transaction, no value was exchanged. 

Gold can be treated similarly, 1 Troy Oz is worth as much as any other single Troy Oz (providing one isn't a good cast of something and the other is standard bullion or whatever). Albeit your local pawn shop owner is going to give you funny looks if you asked for a 1:1 swap; after verification that there's no evidence of forgery or foul play of quality and quantity, there'd be no question that they aren't worth the same. 

Digital fiat is just not fungible at all. Anyone who wishes to make sure their ill gotten wired funds are ""cleaned"" would have to bounce and wash the funds for a good long time before it's usable. And while at that point, after the tumbling, it'd be worth equal to what it is, so much time and money would have to be spent to make that usable, that compared to the original value $1 =/= $1...

Bitcoin, however, is a different animal. If I were to offer you a 1:1 trade of the Bitcoin you own for the same amount from me, would you hesitate? Or would it be possible I could take your ""clean btc"" fresh from coinbase and in return give you some ""tainted btc"" I got from selling meth on the darkweb (for examples sake, obviously I'm not selling drugs). Or you could be an honest business owner, peddling your wares for (bit)coin. A passerby decides to procure some of your goods. They leave your stand with the goods and you receive the payment. All is good. Until the boys in blue show up to ""Civil Asset Forfeiture"" your fairly earned funds because the guy you sold your products to got that coin from his buddy that stole it from someone else. Suddenly, you've got the shaft end of a raw deal with virtually no legal recourse...

With Bitcoin, that kind of ownership history is both easily linkable and easily associated with whomever received it. And inherently, tainted Bitcoin is worth significantly less than clean coins. Which means it'd be impossible to say that Bitcoin is fungible. There isn't much contextual flexibility about that. The risk is always there, regardless of the situation or context.

And that's ok. There are certainly loads of reasonably understandable use cases that would be ideal for. But lacking fungibility is not a property that Bitcoin can have properly. Because cryptocurrency is a whole different animal, you need extremely well implemented privacy features to achieve a usable function of fungibility. 

Because the history of each coin is so easily traced from its origin to the current point in time, it's important that said history is kept from prying eyes. Privacy features are incredibly important for other, more practical reasons as well. You're probably not likely to do too much business with big time drug dealers. In a more practical scenario, you wouldn't want everyone you send and receive money to and from to have the ability to see your complete transaction history and an up to date count of exactly how much cash you have on your person at that moment, do you? 

Anyway, sorry for the longer than I anticipated reply. Obviously I feel compelled to help others realize the importance of privacy features and their ability to provide proper fungibility.

"> Instead of using Coinjoin can you just use a big reputable exchange where you do not have to do KYC ?

It's not ""either or"" question, you can do both (no-KYC and coinjoin) ;)  

KYC does play a big part in hurting the privacy of bitcoin users, but it's not the only part. There are companies like Chainalysis, Elliptic, Crystal (by Bitfury) and others that are not only work with KYC compliant companies, but also do analysis on their own. You can improve your privacy by a lot when using coinjoin for at least a portion of your coins, even when you manage to avoid KYC services.";1;0;False;TheGreatMuffin;ffgo08k;Need help with anonymizing my Bitcoins;et82ak;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/et82ak/need_help_with_anonymizing_my_bitcoins/
Let me say something. I use Wasabi to loose my name from tracking. After coinjoin  you should  never enter centralised exchange again like binance. You are risking loose your coins. They want money! They will confiscate your bitcoin and say something like they are tainted, government is real criminal here. They want to take your coins anyway ( enormous taxes and will say illegal) that's why people use wasabi and coinjoin. It's for reason. As long bitcoin wont implement something more secure we will use coinjoin or monero. It adds peace of mind.  And of the day de-centralised exchanged, p2p are king and will be more in future. You can sell coinjoined coins to cash any day any time on Bisq.   BISQ hands down!

Instead of using Coinjoin can you just use a big reputable exchange where you do not have to do KYC ? Some big exchanges give you a limit of 2 BTC for example with no KYC. So for example you use a VPN and open an account at the reputable big exchange with no KYC. Then you send 1 BTC to the exchange and wait for it to appear in your account. After that happens, you can withdraw 1 BTC (minus withdrawal fee) to a brand new public address that is new and anonymous. Yes the drawback is you have to trust the big reputable exchange but you don't have to trust the Coinjoin.

Bitcoin transactions work the same way essentially, but you have inputs (and outputs) instead of physical coins. The more inputs/outputs a transaction has, the more blockspace it takes up.

This is one big step of trickle down money theory,  this money flows down from central banks to big banks to hedge funds to VCs and startups. The bigger and grandiose your story, the more money flows that direction. 

There is definitely some usefulness out of this but this is also one big reason for economic inequality. People who are closer to the source of money figured out a way of enriching themselves constantly telling such stories about grandiose future. 

Bitcoin does not allow borrowing from future. There will only be 21 million bitcoins for ever. If something is so good for humanity, let people vote for that technology with their own money instead of a small group of people choosing to create money for such futuristic purposes.

"> Just because you would be up 30% if you did DCA every year, doesn't mean you get 30% returns every year.

Correct.  I made a table that does the [factoring in APR instead](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/enesw7/a_theoretical_look_at_the_last_1000_days_of_dca/).  As you hint at, DCA is a way to limit risk, not increase profit.  Max profit requires max risk.  It's also how you can realize max loss.  DCA reduces both your profit and loss by reducing your risk.
