Why don't you ask them? OR just get a wage like normal and then buy BTC with it yourself instead of having a company do it for you;3;0;False;homad;ffss69u;BITWAGE.;euzbko;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/euzbko/bitwage/
Can you explain a bit about what it is?;1;1;False;djhatrick12;ffshg86;BITWAGE.;euzbko;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/euzbko/bitwage/
"You can have part of (or all of) your earnings converted to bitcoin.  BitWage lets nearly anyone who receives pay from their employer via a bank transfer to use some or all of those wages to buy bitcoin.

There are two varieties:

- where the [employer signs up with BitWage](https://www.bitwage.com/for-companies) to offer to employees partial or full payment in bitcoin, or
- where the [gig worker](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ce95xt) (e.g. Uber) or employee [signs up with BitWage](https://www.bitwage.com/for-individuals) to receive a virtual bank account number from BitWage, and that is the bank account where the employer's bank transfer sends the employee's pay on payday

If you sign up as freelancer/individual, the entire ""direct deposit"" goes to BitWage, but then you can have them convert $N (or X%) to BTC, and relay the balance to your bank account.  You don't even need to be in the same country as the employer.   BitWage does charge for this, ... even the fiat relay.  So it might be a better deal for you if your employer uses BitWage, and you get just the BTC portion through BitWage. 

I think the fees are in the 5% range on the bitcoin (i.e., poor exchange rate), ... just a 1% on the fiat relay.    Up to two withdrawals per month.  Otherwise if you get paid weekly, and you want to withdraw weekly, also add $16/month fee for ""premium"" service.

So as an individual .... with $600 earned per week, and you want 25% ($150) to go to BTC, you pay ~$7.50 in fees for the bitcoin plus $4.50 on the fiat relay.  So each pay period where you earn $600:

Bitcoin: $142.50 worth
Relayed to your bank: $445.50 
Fees, $12

But again, you can only ""distribute"" to your bank twice a month, .. so you would skip every other one, ... giving you $891 to your bank every two weeks.   Or pay another $16/month in fees to get the $445.50 each week.

"The big banks have already fixed it themselves, but customer uptake is slow.

It looks like all the blockchain.com BTC-wallet receive addresses are legacy (P2PKH) addresses, shame. If I already have funds in a blockchain.com BTC-wallet, can I send those funds to a BTC-segwit (P2SH-P2WPKH) or a BTC-bech32 (P2WSH) address?

What would happen to those funds if I tried?

"Talk to an accountant. But just so you know, if your losses are in a different year than your gains you can seriously fuck yourself. 

I doubt you made a lot in profits though, maybe you’re just not reading it correctly? There are websites like cointracker or bitcoin.tax which can read the data and help you file your taxes but you sound super lost so an accountant isn’t a bad idea. You’ll basically owe whatever the final number is after you take all your gains and subtract all your losses from 2019 but there are a lot of ways to interpret that which an accountant can help with.

I really doubt you fucked up that bad if you kept trading and were at a loss at the end of the year though.

But seriously, don’t get into trading without considering the tax consequences! I know someone who had to pay six figures in taxes for Monero<->BTC trading and then their monero tanked but they had all these paper profits from the prior year. Luckily they made a six figure income and had enough in savings to pay it off, but if you don’t you’re gonna be up shit creek.

I’ve paid five figures in fake gains on crypto before too from contributing to an ico with bubbled priced crypto.

"Haven't seen that form before, but it doesn't sound like I traded at the volume you did. Was that $1.9M in total trades? Obligatory ""I'm not a CPA"", but I'm pretty sure you're only taxed on your profits \\ losses. The fact that the total volume is that high doesn't matter. On the other hand, I've heard you have to fill out a form to document each trade, so that might be a pain in the ass.

"Keep laughing—while you can. The interest you get comes from loaning your bitcoins to short sellers. They sell your bitcoins and then drive the price down hoping to buy them back lower. This has worked well for them the last 2 years. 

HOWEVER, if the price of bitcoin should increase suddenly then they won’t have $ to buy back lower. They will go out of business and won’t be able to repay BlockFi, which in turn won’t be able to give the BTC back to you. 

Once you deposit your bitcoins in BlockFi they are no longer yours. Sleep well.";4;2;False;bjman22;ffs9kgb;Why We Must BOYCOTT BlockFi!;euxa2w;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXIZBvmHfsQ
A loan can function perfectly to take a low leveraged long too. I took a small USD loan with BTC as collateral (not at blockfi, but another lending platform) and bought more Bitcoin. I only do it with a fraction of my BTC, because I want to HODL most of my BTC myself and what I use as collateral I am willing to risk.

Do as much personal research into Bitcoin as you can before you buy. E.g. learn about what it is/ how it works/ what's happening in the industry etc. The more you learn, the better informed you'll be when it comes to making decisions. :);1;0;False;coincornerjo;fft2exo;Question about buying bitcoin.;euvupu;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/euvupu/question_about_buying_bitcoin/
"Nobody knows the future price.

What you could do is follow Dollar Cost Averaging. That's where you spread your buys over a certain period of time. e..g, 6 months, you buy $50 each month, to get you investing your target of $300 (for an example).

If the exchange rate goes down from here, great, your average price for your position will be less than ~$9K per BTC. If the exchange rate goes up from here, great, you got at least some at ~$9K per, which you wouldn't have gotten had you sat on the $300 for six months and bought all at once then.

There's still the risk of it going down after you purchase, but this strategy is one that works for many who struggle with FOMO or who stress over trying to time the market.

Basically, how do you create a payment system where a 3rd party wouldn't have the power to steal any money or control the system - that is, no centralization? Blockchain does this, with something called proof of work.

"Bitcoin was conceived to be scarce, secure (from government attacks) money first and foremost.  The blockchain is merely an implementation detail, one of several software designs in Bitcoin necessary to create money.

The blockchain has a single purpose in Bitcoin: to enable a decentralized network to reach consensus around a single history of events.

Why store events in linked blocks unless you want to allow anyone in the network to be able to propose a block and need to order them?

How do you decide which blockchain is the true one without a monetary incentive to run proof of work/stake?

Yea, we are in agreement. This post was just my response to somebody in a different thread. Was trying to show, through question and answer, how one could realize that the application of blockchain technology to a process that is controlled by a centralized entity (like a company or a hierarchical organization) would be completely pointless.;1;0;False;anon2414691;ffs0ihq;Is this the logic that explains why blockchain wouldn't be an innovation for anything other than money?;eusu9x;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/eusu9x/is_this_the_logic_that_explains_why_blockchain/
"> A blockchain could be used to identify citizens or staff, to secure voting processes, or to keep government and business records honest. 

None of those are tied to incentives to secure it, though.  At that point you may as well just use a conventional database with a central authority, and require that each record be cryptographically signed.

It's like the whole ""oh we'll just put real estate records on (((THE BLOCKCHAIN!!!)))""  Yeah, so what?  When some court orders a transfer, you're either going to update that blockchain to comply with the court order or you're going to go to prison for contempt of court.

Blockchains work for a very limited number of things.  Money is one.

"If fees are your primary concern, .. then can you beat ""negative fees""?

With a P2P exchange, you can create a Buy ad and set your own price (e.g., 4% below spot).  You are competing with other buyers, so if you want to find a seller you'll have to offer a fair price, but most trades there that happen from a seller taking a BUY offer result in the buyer (i.e., you) paying below spot.  That's sometimes referred to as ""negative fees'.  If you are needing your coins sooner, you can always take a seller's ad, but in that instance you are the one paying the premium, and the seller benefits from ""negative fees"".

"**Murray Bookchin**

Murray Bookchin (January 14, 1921 – July 30, 2006) was an American social theorist, author, orator, historian, and political philosopher. A pioneer in the ecology movement, Bookchin formulated and developed the theory of social ecology and urban planning, within anarchist, libertarian socialist, and ecological thought. He was the author of two dozen books covering topics in politics, philosophy, history, urban affairs, and ecology. Among the most important were Our Synthetic Environment (1962), Post-Scarcity Anarchism (1971), The Ecology of Freedom (1982) and Urbanization Without Cities (1987).

***

**Communalism**

Communalism usually refers to a system that integrates communal ownership and federations of highly localized independent communities. A prominent libertarian socialist, Murray Bookchin, defines the communalist political philosophy that he developed as ""a theory of government or a system of government in which independent communes participate in a  federation"", as well as ""the principles and practice of communal ownership"". The term 'government' in this case does not imply acceptance of a state or top-down hierarchy.This usage of communalism appears to have emerged during the late 20th century to distinguish commune-based systems from other political movements or governments espousing (if not actually practicing) similar ideas. In particular, earlier communities and movements advocating such practices were often described as ""anarchist"", ""socialist"" or ""communist"".Many historical communities practicing utopian socialism or anarcho-communism did implement internal rules of communalist property ownership in the context of federated communalism.

"All systems that have more than one individual in them have governments.  Government is how decisions that affect more than one individual are made.

Families have governments. Corporations are governments.  A bunch of people walking down the sidewalk are a government.

The thing is that there are three basic types of government, totalitarian (top down), democratic (bottom-up and top down), and decentralized (bottom-up).  Most of the larger systems need to be decentralized, while smaller, more voluntary groups (like families and communities) can be democratic.

"""Educated consumers"" is the operative term. Most consumers have no clue what any of these terms mean. And in my experience, many people that consider themselves educated consumers have truly no idea what GMO actually means, they only know that they don't want them.

This is actually not that big of a problem because we're not going to have a public health emergency because people eat non-organic or GMO foods. But with some foods, and especially medications and drugs, this could be a huge problem. If the consumer had to rely on figuring out which of these private-FDAs that are certifying drugs they can trust, and which are blowing smoke up their ass, there could be mass misinformation. The anti-vax movement is a prime example of just this. Except, imagine a scenario where a private-FDA company were empowered to join such a movement, claim to be a good actor and expert in the field, and push the same misinformation.";4;0;False;Yankee9204;ffs73yt;This is why we need the decentralization for Bitcoin;euqxq4;https://v.redd.it/jxxdukh8ucd41

I think a lot of places around the world have people who are not seeking to exploit a system for money and power through corruption as aggressively as others, and then people say, ""oh the system is good"". But there is an unspoken agreement to do things the right way. A moral code.

I think places that are struggling the most, have the worst moral code.

Who exactly is going to determine that the drug was responsible for killing people? This is not a straightforward thing to determine by any means. The FDA has a rigorous process to determine this. They are given access to a plethora of proprietary information about the drug and  conduct a series of clinical trials. If a problem is found, they have high legal latitude to investigate, and they can get a judge to subpoena information. 

In your system, what is the process by which a company that is accused of killing people with their drug will submit to review by one of these private-FDAs?

Thays not it at all. If someone eats food that makes them sick then private entity can be held accountable through civil law suit.  If the fda makes a mistake you can't sue them.

"Here's the problem with the free market.
You assume it's a natural occurance and it isn't it's man made. Markets are a tool, a tool to provide competition in a given framework. This tool and these frameworks are man made and man regulated.

You assume that opening a market allows for solutions to flow through and eventually the best solution wins 

Take this for example.

You found your country, you define a market for roads and under your rules the market decides
I am not a resident to your country just an investor.

I build what I find to be the best route for a road connecting point a and b. Pay for it out of pocket and am allowed to collect tolls in your country for passage on my road. 

Someone thinks they can provide a better road along the same path, at a lower cost then my road so he builds it.

There are now 2 roads serving the same purpose. If everyone wants a piece of the pie who is to stop a 3rd 4th or 5th person from building concurrent roads to outcompete. 

Under pure free market here is no disinscentive to stop building roads if you think you can do it better.

On top of that instead of taxes any passers by is forced to pay a cost for every road use. Because no person will be able to take a road for free.

I only built a road from point a to b. B and c need to be connected but C has low volume of cars and carries no incentive to build there meaning, 1 of a few things.
A) the b to c route is under servered forever because there isn't enough capital or recources around c to justify a road.
B) the road is built at a loss to a or a group of individuals because they expect revenue and can't get it meaning actually the road is never built
C) there's no greater support from your nation, meaning the people around c are exclusively responsible for the building of the road. Your citizens are left under served because your framework doesn't collect and redistribute wealth proportionately.

Where as the current system. We agree there needs to be a road. Our representative government raises tax capital to build.the road. And the community to sponsored the road, every tax payer of your country, now gets access to a road without people competing and at a modest price of whatever % my tax is used for roads and my fee for car registration is what I pay for roads. Comes.out to.be about 500 a year on roads for my country the US.

Can you asure me under your system of government that I will be able to traverse the the entirety of your country for under 500?

Probably not when on the east coast it's 1.50 for a one way trip drop a strip of private highway only 15 miles long.

Main take aways 
1) where do the roads stop? If any person with a subjective opinion is allowed to build a road anyone who wants to can

2) how do you ensure that areas economically unviable and underserved under normal market conditions, your citizens, are entrusted with the same services as those areas that your richest areas have.

3) how can you compete against price racketeering and gouging for basic services?

While our current system isn't perfect we put regulations in place that prevent unnecessary and repetitive services

We ensure that there is incentive to build where conditions might not normally be viable

We ensure through enforceable laws that racketeering cannot be practiced without retalliation in markets that have boiled down to polyopolies that contain the ability to racket.

That's just on the note of taxes and the free market.

"I didn't say outperform, I said outcompete. As in natural selection.

We don't have to lift a finger to do it. Bitcoin's superior properties have already convinced millions of people to use Bitcoin as a value storage asset on its own. As time marches on, those people trust it more and convince their friends & families to do the same. The price isn't driving this; the trust in it over time growing is... But the rising price will continue to compel more and more people into it at an increasing rate.

Meanwhile, the experiment with a purely fiat money, circa 1971, is coming to an end, and everyone on wall street knows it. As inflation turns into hyperinflation, \*all\* economies will turn horrible, and all the smart people will already be holding their savings in bitcoin, not any fiat currency. As that spirals down over the next decade or two, it will become impossible to keep savings in fiat, so bitcoin will literally be the only working currency left standing.

And yes, Central Bank Digital Currencies are still fiat. They'll hyperinflate unless backed by something like gold, but Bitcoin's already well on its' way to outcompete gold.

Yes, the IMF and all commercial banks (Central banks will lose control and die at some point, but commercial banks can always embrace bitcoin) will be in the same boat. Passing laws to outlaw crypto won't help them for long... Even the senators who pass the bills won't be able to store value in a declining currency.

">Here's the problem with the free market. You assume it's a natural occurance and it isn't it's man made.

It's as natural as two neanderthals meeting in the woods and trading a pelt for some fish. VOLUNTARY trade is natural. Taking taxes and making restrictions on trade is unnatural. Coerced, even. Markets are not a tool, they are a series of exchanges like that neanderthal's. And they happen to be the only way man has ever discovered to find a good, honest price for goods and services.

&#x200B;

>You assume that opening a market allows for solutions to flow through and eventually the best solution wins

Not exactly. Less than optimal solutions sometimes win out too in a free market, but the fact is that a regulated market causes and protects monopolies that cannot be overtaken by forces normally present in a free market.  (i.e. competition) So the free market is always better.

&#x200B;

>You found your country, you define a market for roads

Already off on the wrong track. Free-to-use smaller roads emerge on their own in free markets throughout history. Hell, deer can make roads. I've made a road. It wasn't hard, I just made a flat place and poured some stuff on it. If you own a property or a business, you'll need other people to use some road to get to you.

It's only the multi-billion dollar freeways, which take major investment, that would become toll roads. Acquiring those miles of end-to-end real estate is an extremely expensive and time-consuming task... Likely a multi-generational task! There will be no toll freeways side-by-side competing in that way. It's just way too impractical.

&#x200B;

>Where as the current system. We agree there needs to be a road. Our representative government raises tax capital to build.the road.

How fitting that you just left out the most noteworthy part... The one that has absolutely no place in civilized society: They literally steal property from citizens without recompensation in order to build those roads. Sometimes at Gunpoint.

And you actually defend this behavior?

&#x200B;

>how can you compete against price racketeering and gouging for basic services?

Governments are the biggest racketeers in history; I hope I don't have to explain that one to you. Meanwhile, price gouging is the ugly face of free markets, but it is the most ethical option available in high-scarcity situations.

Have you considered how stupidly harmful the alternative is? Destroying the free market, especially in disaster areas, guarantees that more people go without. Forcing merchants to come into a disaster area and sell stuff at an unprofitable price is both slavery and theft to that merchant.

"1. No, not 100% sure.  Some of the older address formats (P2PK, P2IP) are no longer used.  For those address formats you may need to search for a bit to find a wallet that supports them.  Since most paper wallets use what is called `Legacy` addresses (P2PKH), it is imaginable that there may be some future, be it 10, 20, or 100 years away where P2PKH fall out of use in favor of bech32 addresses.  Very unlikely, but possible.  So not 100% grantee, but likely a 90% confidence.
2. It's not totally different.  A BIP39 seed is just a different kind of secret.  Similar in many ways to a WIF key (paper wallet).  You could make a ""paper wallet"" out of a BIP39 seed just as easily as you could a WIF seed.
3. Well kinda.  `market-cap = total_supply * spot_price`.  Since `total_supply` increases ever so slightly every day it does skew the math by the smallest fraction.  But in principle yes, if `market_cap` doubles, then `spot_price` doubles as well.

"> What's so bad about a 51% attack?

Not much, but also it's something  
See the recent Bitcoin Gold 51% attack for reference  

On 2 separate days last week, an attacker spent about $800 per hour for 2 hours shadow mining Bitcoin Gold at a hash rate higher than the network, and then replaced the most recent 13-15 blocks with 12-16 blocks that double-spent about $70000 worth of coin purchases on the Binance exchange  
How? The attackers bought some coins on Binance, mined a bunch of blocks for two hours where those purchase transactions were replaced by send-to-self transactions. The shadow-mined blocks had more total work in them, so they replaced 2 hours of blocks mined by normal miners  
Binance has a 10-block confirmation delay for Bitcoin Gold. The replacement chain tip was greater than 10 blocks long. The attackers got to keep the coins they purchased on Binance, and they also got to keep their Bitcoin Gold  

What's so bad? Binance lost $70k - who cares?  
What's bad is that now Binance and other exchanges will increase their Bitcoin Gold confirmation delay to (maybe) 20 blocks  

If the OP's ""nation state attacks Bitcoin"" hypothetical was possible, if a single country was able to 51% attack Bitcoin for 1000 blocks, then Bitcoin confirmation delays would have to increase to 1100 blocks or more so that exchanges and merchants could be certain that their customers were not exploiting the 51% attack with send-to-self double-spends  
An 1100 block confirmation requirement would destroy confidence in Bitcoin. Most people would stop using it  

> Chain splits are a natural and expected to happen. The ""measure"" in place is the rule that the longest chain is the valid chain

That's correct, but if a 51% attacker has enough hash power to shadow mine 1000 blocks with more work, then their 1000 blocks make a longer chain and will replace the most recent 1000 blocks, invalidating any transactions which are missing from the shadow chain, and allowing the transaction senders to keep the Bitcoin they spent in the deleted 1000 blocks  


Of course, it costs much more than $800 per hour to 51% attack Bitcoin. Also, the logistics make it impossible. All the manufacturing capacity for SHA256 ASIC devices is pre-sold to legitimate miners. There is no spare capacity for the government to acquire the same amount of hashing power as the current network, no buildings to install that many devices, no spare power supply to power them, and no idle technicians waiting to perform the installation and commissioning work  
And then, even authoritarian governments answer to the people for their financial competence. No government would ever waste the billions it would cost to launch such an attack, with so many more important demands on the taxpayers' purse - hospitals, schools, trains. In 1958-1961, Mao starved 38 million people to death for a failed industrialization campaign. The current leaders carry the lessons of Mao's greatest failures.

As an exchange, I think they'd err on the side of caution. You did a trade worth $5k. (Is it common for Russians to speak in $ as opposed to rubles?)

Also, nitpick: You *are* using RPC when you use `bitcoin-cli` locally, so you *can* use RPC, you just cannot use it over the LAN, possibly because of some setting in your RPi, most likely the firewall, but also possibly some of the `bitcoin.conf` settings in the RPi.;1;0;False;almkglor;ffsyzkk;Mentor Monday, January 27, 2020: Ask all your bitcoin questions!;eumhm3;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/eumhm3/mentor_monday_january_27_2020_ask_all_your/
"The *normal* non-RPC interface goes through Tor so you do not need that interface to be allowed through.  It seems plausible to me that you need `ufw` to allow the RPC port through.

The **normal** non-RPC interface is port 8333, so you should keep that blocked in your firewall.  The RPC interface is port 8332.  With a Tor hidden service you do ***not*** need to let port 8333 through, because Tor hidden services do not use IP.  The RPC interface has to be let through in your firewall because you are using IP to access it in your LAN.

***Of course***, this does require that your Internet-to-LAN interface (typically a combined router + wired LAN hub + wifi LAN hub provided by your ISP, but could be something else, depends) have a firewall that blocks incoming ports.  Almost every such, when installed by your ISP, will by default block ***all*** incoming ports, especially if all your computers installed are not using Windows systems, so usually you are fine, but if you set up port forwarding be very careful as well with the firewall on each machine.  So allowing 8332 through in `ufw` risks someone entering your LAN accessing your `bitcoind` RPC interface, possibly stealing funds and disrupting its operation.";1;1;False;almkglor;ffsypqb;Mentor Monday, January 27, 2020: Ask all your bitcoin questions!;eumhm3;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/eumhm3/mentor_monday_january_27_2020_ask_all_your/

Install `nmap` on the AMD64 system.  If it is a standard Linux  distro, it should be available using standard installation /package system (`apt install` on Debian/Ubuntu derivatives for example).  This is a tool which tests ports.  Try `nmap -p8332 ${RPI_IP_ADDR}`.  This scans if port 8332 is responding to external network.  It could be that the bind is limited to local (binds only `127.0.0.1`) so it might not be exposed on the LAN interface.;1;1;False;almkglor;ffsya4g;Mentor Monday, January 27, 2020: Ask all your bitcoin questions!;eumhm3;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/eumhm3/mentor_monday_january_27_2020_ask_all_your/

I like using a Tor hidden service myself, because of the free NAT-traversal it gives you.

"**Eastern Bloc**

The Eastern Bloc, also known as the Communist Bloc, the Socialist Bloc and the Soviet Bloc, was the group of communist states of Central and Eastern Europe, East Asia, and Southeast Asia under the hegemony of the Soviet Union (USSR) during the Cold War (1947–1991) in opposition to the capitalist Western Bloc. Generally, in Western Europe the term Eastern Bloc referred to the USSR and its satellite states in the Comecon (East Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and Albania); in Asia, the Soviet Bloc comprised the Mongolian People's Republic, the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, the Lao People's Democratic Republic and the People's Republic of Kampuchea, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the People's Republic of China (before the Sino-Soviet split in 1961). In the Americas, the Communist Bloc included the Caribbean Republic of Cuba, since 1961.Soviet control of the Eastern Bloc was tested by the 1948 Czechoslovak coup d'état and the Tito–Stalin Split over the direction of the People's Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the Chinese Communist Revolution (1949), and China's participation in the Korean War. After Stalin's death in 1953, the Korean War ceased with the 1954 Geneva Conference.

"It's all perspective. Bitcoin is a paradigm shift in that its the first time someone truly thought about money, it's uses and its best properties and just made something that has those things and nothing else. The best money ever invented. Apolitical non sovereign permissionless and super portable and transferable with a non-rejiggable monetary policy that was set in stone and everyone can depend on it from here til the last bit is issued in 2134 and yonder. 

If being right is measured by bitcoins price then anyone who today feels right, tomorrow will 'be proven' wrong until the next carousel go-round. 

Its philosophy and way to view the world, and the ability to for the first time ever OPT OUT with your money and into a transparent currency not controlled by fallible human beings is what this is all really about.

> Don't overestimate the publics interest of the *currency* component of crypto. The world has little interest in it yet. Look at BCH, noone uses it and it has cheap fees.

This is the heart of the SoV vs currency disagreement we share. As you put it, I perhaps am overestimating the currency aspect of crypto while you may be underestimating it. Also, know that 50% of my holdings are in BTC and 50% in Monero. I do love both (though Monero more).

I see where you’re coming from though, in that a transparent ledger like BTC offers a quicker path to regulatory approval. However I continue to believe that the heart of crypto is its decentralized nature, and the real benefit of decentralization is *censorship resistance*. What was the *only* popular decentralized software in the world pre-crypto? It’s bittorrent. Decentralized file sharing. And what is it used for?

Nor did I have knowledge of how derivatives and fiat currency have an underlying problem that will undoubtedly yield negative repercussions.

"A USB stick is only highly secure if it is a bootable linux distro. You ONLY boot it when not connected to the internet so it's an offline system. No method is 100% secure but this gets very close for minimal cost and effort. 

Using a USB stick with Electrum and plugging it into your desktop is barely any different than just having it on your system. As soon as you plug it in any malware can immediately find your wallet and relay home. With a keyboard logger it can gain your password and send that.

Read up on using Electrum offline. With a bootable USB stick you (1) boot on it to create your wallet while disconnected. Write down the seed words. (2) Save the xpub (master public key) and take that back to a normal desktop install of Electrum. (3) Use the desktop Electrum as watch-only wallet to monitor and create txs. (4) Save unsigned txs on USB and only open and sign them on your offline boot (while disconnected). (5) Broadcast the tx back on the desktop wallet. Making sure the offline system never connects to the internet again (mostly) ensures any malware on that system cannot relay data back home even if infected. 

A hardware wallet is very similar but more convenient (no rebooting twice). If you are holding a significant btc value and plan to do txs fairly often then it is worthwhile. I used the USB boot method for years and found when I got a Trezor that a mental barrier was dropped to spending/using btc but for simple long term hodling a usb boot stick is your next best thing and is pretty much free.";4;0;False;jcoinner;ffufw4t;Just got hacked and BTC stolen.

"You don't necessarily need a hardware wallet, as some suggested, but I also strongly advise against storing everything on a single USB stick. USB sticks can break or be stolen. A cheap, secure solution would be to store a backup of your seed on 2 different USB sticks or pieces of paper, stored in different locations.

Whenever you need access to your money, download the light wallet of your choice and use your seed and you will have instant access to your money. I recommend the Jaxx light desktop wallet (NEVER use a smartphone wallet) - it has selectable transaction fees, supports a wide range of cryptos, has been around for years and you can further secure it with a password. The source code is publicly available for review, ensuring nobody at the company ever sees your keys or has access to your money.

The most common way crypto gets stolen is if your computer (or phone, if you want to make extra-sure someone steals your money) is compromised with a keylogger or virus that sends your files in the background to a hacker. This is why you should use a good anti-virus, like Kaspersky Internet Security. You could also just use a different computer whenever you want to send money, a computer that is used for nothing else, ensuring your chance of getting hacked is almost non-existant. Any cheap piece of shit $150 computer will do for this purpose.

If you do get a hardware wallet, always remember to back up your seed. It can break or be stolen, just like the USB.

EDIT: You mostly can't keep the wallet software on an USB stick and have it function on different computers unless the wallet is designed to be portable.

Most open-source phone wallets are actually very secure. Look into Samourai and Whirlpool if you are concerned about privacy and get a hardware wallet for your cold storage. I personally recommend Coldcard and Trezor. Also learn how to use TAILS and the Electrum wallet that is included with it.

Be more skeptical and don't trust; verify. Do a lot of research and understand how things work before staking your money on it. Don't put trust in a single person but if don't understand something, find out what other people are saying about it. If it isn't at least somewhat popular amongst the most educated people in the space, don't use it.

Practice a lot before staking a lot of money or doing something sketchy.";7;1;False;Dizz14;ffuazbe;Just got hacked and BTC stolen. Need advice on new storage.;ev95k7;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ev95k7/just_got_hacked_and_btc_stolen_need_advice_on_new/

"If you are looking to Buy bitcoin with fiat money, then the methods available will differ based on a few factors:

- Where are you located (country)?
- How much are you looking to buy?
- What payment methods do you have available?
- How soon do you need access to the proceeds?
- Is financial privacy important?

You indicated that you wish to maintain your financial privacy (i.e., by not revealing your SSN nor your age.)

You can purchase online using a No-KYC online store, paying by depositing cash in a bank account or through Moneygram/Western Union:

- [BitQuick QuickBuy](https://www.bitquick.co/quick-buy) [**NO-KYC** (when trx amount is under $400)]

There are physical locations where there are Bitcoin ATMs and other vending/voucher methods.  For example, in the U.S. there is:

- https://coinatmradar.com  <-- Some will require Identity verification/KYC, others just a phone number (e.g., CoinFlip ATMs, when $900 or less), or nothing at all
- https://www.coinstar.com/bitcoin (with [2,200+ locations in the U.S.](https://coinme.com/kiosks))  <-- Identity verification/KYC
- https://libertyx.com/a/buy/locations  <-- Cashier (cash), and/or Kiosk (debit card)
- https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/dabf2m  <-- Some will require identify verification/KYC, but not all will.

Otherwise, an in-person cash trade or an online trade using a P2P trading exchange may possibly be your next best option.  There are No-KYC payment methods that include in-person cash trades, cash deposited in the seller's bank account, cash-in-the-mail, postal money order,and prepaid gift card.  There are sellers on these P2P exchanges who accept these payment methods.   Gift card will be the more expensive methods to buy bitcoin because they are risky for the seller to accept. 

*P2P Trading exchanges*

- [Person-to-person (P2P) Trading Exchanges](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/dyclf8)
- https://exchangerates.pro  <-- Choose country and/or Payment Method

Using gift cards, there is [CardCoins](https://www.cardcoins.co) for paying with a non-reloadable, prepaid GIFT card (VISA/Mastercard/AMEX/Discover),  [CryptoVoucher.io](https://cryptovoucher.io) for paying with gift cards for numerous brands, [Redeem](https://www.redeeem.com/gift-cards), and [BitOf](https://bitof.io/) for paying with Amazon UK gift cards).  Most of these methods will require identity verification/KYC though.

First time buyers may like the convenience of an online store that sells bitcoin and accepts debit and/or credit card. I do not know which ones require ID verification/KYC beyond those marked as such. (e.g., [Switchere](https://switchere.com) [**NO-KYC**], [Rebiton](https://rebiton.com) [**NO-KYC**], [Bitsell X](https://bitsellx.com) [[💳](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card)] [**NO-KYC**], [CoinCorner](https://coincorner.com) [[💳](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card)] [**NO-KYC** when £900 or less], [CEX.io](https://CEX.io.com), [Coinify](https://www.coinify.com), [Paybis](https://paybis.com), [Jubiter](https://app.jubiter.com/neworder/buy), [Bittylicious](https://bittylicious.com), [BitIreland](https://bitireland.ie), [Kuna.io Money](https://money.kuna.io), [LiteBit.eu](https://www.litebit.eu/en/buy), [Conio.com](https://conio.com) App, [CryptoVoucher.io](https://cryptovoucher.io), [GetSatoshi.org](https://getsatoshi.org) ([⚡](https://lightningnetworkstores.com/wallets)), [Cash App](https://cash.app/bitcoin) and CoinMama). You can buy BTC on Cash App without ID but you won't be able to withdraw them until you are KYC verified.


Here's a useful comparison of exchanges in which you can filter on payment method.  Most of these methods will require identity verification/KYC though.

"**Credit card**

A credit card is a payment card issued to users (cardholders) to enable the cardholder to pay a merchant for goods and services based on the cardholder's promise to the card issuer to pay them for the amounts plus the other agreed charges. The card issuer (usually a bank) creates a revolving account and grants a line of credit to the cardholder, from which the cardholder can borrow money for payment to a merchant or as a cash advance.

A credit card is different from a charge card, which requires the balance to be repaid in full each month. In contrast, credit cards allow the consumers to build a continuing balance of debt, subject to interest being charged.

"First off, how much do you pay for electricity?

At something like ~$9K BTC/USD, the bitcoin miner's equilibrium is about $0.07 per kWh, using an Antminer S9 and today's difficulty level.  This means if you pay more than ~$0.05 per KWh, unplug your ASIC miner and sell it -- it's cheaper to buy bitcoin than operate a bitcoin mining rig.  You are competing against professional miners who earn a decent profit by paying just $0.03 to $0.04 per kWH.

And that equilibrium fluctuates based on difficulty and the exchange rate, so don't count on $0.07 equilibrium lasting.  It could easily drop to $0.05 or much lower even in the next year.  And with [halving](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/cejo72) coming in May, your BTC revenue will drop by nearly half.

99.9% they're trying to scam you.

Skip the escrow, get them to send you to coins directly to a wallet private key you have generated yourself (do not accept some scammy web wallet with a fake balance but wont let you withdrawal using KYC verification or you need to deposit 0.2 bitcoins to withdrawal)

GreenAddress for android would be suitable.  Make sure to record your mnemonic seed words safely, then generate a public key, then send your ""buyer"" instructions to deposit the bitcoin there.  Wait 6 confirmations before completing the trade. (About 1 hour)

Which is why I never referenced or recommended Samurai. If you have a source showing xpub leaks with Wasabi, please do provide them. Regardless, the issue being discussed is that you claimed your xpub is only leaked when explicitly given, and that is clearly not the case with most wallets. Select your software accordingly.;0;0;False;HiFi24Seven;ffuihzm;Yet another reason you should be running your own full node..;ev37wd;https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/1221439283925594112?s=20
You don't have a choice, bud. Most wallets leak xpub automatically when you use 3rd party servers in order to verify the transaction. This is not something you have control over. There are only a handful of privacy-focused wallets that don't do this - Wasabi being the most popular. This is why if you use a hardware wallet like the Ledger Nano S, it is advised that you setup a separate pin with attached passphrase for use exclusively with Wasabi and to NEVER use that pin when logging into Ledger Live or every transaction associated with that seed will be linked together. This is because, like most wallets, Ledger Live leaks xpub to 3rd party servers, and there is no way to prevent this from happening. The only alternatives are to run your own node and use wallets that can be configured to connect exclusively to that node. This is literally the reason that Electrum Personal Server exists for Electrum users.;0;1;False;HiFi24Seven;ffucsgr;Yet another reason you should be running your own full node..;ev37wd;https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/1221439283925594112?s=20
"Source? Ledger Live is open-source software. Could you please point me to the line of code where this is coded into the app?

From Ledger's documentation (which I write, as I happen to work at Ledger):

>**Your xpub is never sent to Ledger's servers.**

Electrum only sends hashes of addresses to it's servers, not any mpk. I think it's still better to use your own node with Electrum but at least it's not sharing master keys or addresses. Granted, a hash of an address is not so much better - modified server code can always link address to hash and reverse the lookups.;2;0;False;jcoinner;fftdet0;Yet another reason you should be running your own full node..;ev37wd;https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/1221439283925594112?s=20
"The Wasabi developers, along with quite a few others that are active in the community, seem to think otherwise. Perhaps you could start a discussion on their subreddit to discuss this further. If their information is inaccurate, it would be to everyone's benefit to know that.

As I mentioned in my other response to you though, whether Ledger is innocent of these claims or not isn't really the point.

It depends on the software interface that the hardware wallet is connected to. If you're using a Ledger Nano S, for example, and are connecting it to Ledger Live, you're leaking your xpub to their servers and there's nothing you can do to configure otherwise. If you connect your Nano S to a privacy-focused wallet that's specifically designed to not leak xpub to 3rd party servers (i.e. Wasabi) or are using a wallet that's configured to connect exclusively to your own node, then you're fine.;2;1;False;HiFi24Seven;fftzw58;Yet another reason you should be running your own full node..;ev37wd;https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/1221439283925594112?s=20
">but I disagree that it's related to keeping HD details (xpub, chaincode) secret & avoiding address reuse. That can all be managed by a hardware wallet without revealing anything to a node, right?

">Well, you probably just should skip sharing your xpub which is also good for privacy should you decide to stop trusting a node and you don't want to abandon the account.

I figured that the point was that if you've shared it once in the past then it's always considered vulnerable, at least as far as this possible attack vector goes.

"Concepts from complexity science, econophysics, and scale-free theory were used by a group of scientists. Research on the nonlinear models giving theoretical underpinning to equations representing mirror markets as complex dynamical systems has been done. Also, the “herding behavior” literature in finance marks a significant recognition that interdependent trader behavior may result in deviation from normal distribution of returns, as does “chartist” trading. Using simple J-statistic based on the moments defined by the orthonormal polynomials associated with the geometric distribution, this new approach tackles most of the drawbacks usually associated to duration based backtesting procedures. First, its implementation is extremely easy. Second, it allows for a separate test for unconditional coverage, independence and conditional coverage hypothesis. Third, feasibility of the tests is improved. Fourth, Monte-Carlo simulations show that for realistic sample sizes, our BTC test outperforms traditional duration based test.

"> Most libertarian believe that there is very little you need federal government for. Something like basic military, environmental protections, and a supreme court to uphold the constitution.

I somehow ended up a (pseudo-)libertarian without knowing what the word means or that there was such a school of thought or whatever it is. I just used to think ""why do we have to follow (((their))) rules, why do they dictate everything, taxing everything you earn, taxing everything you buy, making arbitrary rules like throwing people in jail for one plant, while letting corporations get rich off of a much worse plant etc.""

But I've given this kind of thinking (decentralizing government) much thought, especially after discovering bitcoin, and then again after reading the ""Libertarian Police"" copypasta here:  
https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/7iqxko/libertarian_police_department/

I thought how could it world work if there was no government. Would we ever be able to wrestle control away from them by decentralizing money?

And my conclusion is that... it can't work.

Eventually, power will be concentrated somewhere. Whether it be a private corporation that sells security/police services that have the biggest private armies or strongest weapons, or if democratic countries go fully capitalist and privatize everything, while communist countries remain authoritarian and thus keep their centralized powerful governments, then who would be able to contest them?

And the only logical conclusion is that they (whether they are a corporation or a country) will try to gain MORE POWER. The most powerful entities/groups in the world always try to gain more power. Just look at all the world conquest attempts in history: 

- Alexander the Great, 
- Genghis Khan, 
- the Roman empire, 
- the Persian empire
- ... even the Chinese dynasties tried to conquer and unite ""all under heaven""  
(Tianxia/天下), etc.

The United States is the greatest power right now, and they are not exempt from this. They are trying to keep it that way, whether it be by the petrodollar, controlling the Middle East and their oil, giving sanctions to other countries etc. But countries like Russia and China know they have a fighting chance and you can see them doing any possible action they can to increase their chances of gaining that power, like stockpiling gold, after seeing cracks in the all-powerful petrodollar:

"The point was to get the OP to think about what a 51% attack actually is, since he was just talking out of his ass and shouting ""51% attack"" without knowing what the problem was.

>See the recent Bitcoin Gold 51% attack for reference

So there you go, you cite an actual problem: double spending. Yes a 51% attack could result in double spending. Yes, that is bad, but not as bad as it originally sounds. As you note, only one party was affected: Binance. Every other user in the ecosystem was unaffected. Typically exchanges are going to be the ones who are at most risk, since they hold all of the fiat. Its extremely unlikely that a nation state is going to try to double spend against a normal person, or a small business merchant. But even if they did, it can be combatted. You mention one solution, just wait more blocks before considering your txn settled..

> If the OP's ""nation state attacks Bitcoin"" hypothetical was possible, if a single country was able to 51% attack Bitcoin for 1000 blocks...  
An 1100 block confirmation requirement would destroy confidence in Bitcoin. Most people would stop using it 

However, your solution is simply unrealistic. First of all, to continually attack bitcoin for 1000 blocks is going to cost a fortune (lets say billions). Second, even if they somehow decide that its worth it (which it isnt), then they have to build or buy the computing power without word getting out (as you mention). If they accomplish that, they can only do it one time. Once the network is aware of someone with the capability of a 1000 block reorg, the community will just decide to hard fork and change the PoW, which renders their billions worth of machinery immediately useless. So they spent all their time and billions of dollars, to accomplish 1 reorg, and then the community forks and we start over. Yes, the network will certainly take a hit, and market price will likely drop in the meantime.

So all in all, if the answer to ""whats so bad about a 51% attack"" is ""coins can be double spent"", I'd say the risk isn't as large as it initially seems.";1;0;False;buttonstraddle;ffth6zp;What stops a 51% attack on Bitcoin;eupup7;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/eupup7/what_stops_a_51_attack_on_bitcoin/

They are beginning to do so. You know what is doing? It's creating wild market fluctuations. The bull runs and bear runs are fueled by speculative investing and ruins Bitcoin's value as a stable currency. Value comes naturally when it facilitates trade. Right now we have tons of people putting their money into the market to pump and dump like stocks. A currency thrives under stability, as the price is ultimately a number. You'll still need the same buying power no matter what the number behind it is measured in. As long as investing occurs without a justifiable volume of transactions these bubbles will continue to burst. The only ones really using your anonymised currency using distributed computing for mass transacting is the folks on the dark web who protect their anonymity through distributed networks. That's the only true economy that uses Bitcoin and that's the face of Bitcoin like it or not. Trying to make Bitcoin 'appeal' to deep pockets is what brought about price instability and a decent sized exodus to Monero, a coin with the frequent slogan, 'Don't buy Monero. ' Bitcoin doesn't fit in, and the only people truly using it don't fit in so trying to make it fit in to the masses through appeal will never work. Bitcoin has always thrived from action not word. It is a coin that has withstood attacks and no one can take down. It facilates transactions without government consent or using exchange rates. If people are drawn to Bitcoin as a transacting currency it is going to be through what it can do. The more we develop the technology and facilitate trade and payment with the currency online, the more true and non speculative adoption we will have and that's the how we can break into the mainstream. The bitcoin craze didn't begin because of how well people hodled. The bitcoin craze began when someone made that first trade of 10,000 Bitcoin's for two pizzas.;1;0;False;TogetherWeStand;fftt01i;Girlfriend just got me this for my birthday!

You're welcome, buying on [Coinbase.com](https://Coinbase.com) is quick and painless so it's a great way to get new money into Crypto, but the fees will soon add up. Be sure to do a little research and watch a few YT videos, then come back to Reddit if you have questions.;2;0;False;bullett007;ffuwgsi;Finally Own A Small Piece of BTC;eu7ibz;https://i.redd.it/oxuqa90zx4d41.jpg

You both agree when you accept the deal. If the deal is for you to send me 2 btc then that means the Bitcoin chain is the one we both must be on. The Bitcoin chain is the longest one with the most cumulative proof of work. So if you send me 2 btc and I'm not on the Bitcoin chain it's not your problem. I have the private key to the address I gave you and I can spend the btc once I catch up with the real chain. So your part of the deal would be done.;1;0;False;Kalin101;ffuwen6;How to make sure the recipient is on the same chain?;eu7jiq;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/eu7jiq/how_to_make_sure_the_recipient_is_on_the_same/
