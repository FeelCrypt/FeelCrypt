"Recovering funds without Trezor device

In case your Trezor device gets lost or damaged, you can access your funds using your recovery seed and Electrum.

WarningThis should be used in emergency situations only. To keep your funds safe at all times, we recommend getting a new Trezor device to recover your funds (see Recovery) and not revealing your recovery seed to any third party. If you do decide to reveal your seed to a third party, send the funds to a new Trezor-secured account as soon as possible.

To recover your wallet in Electrum, follow these step:

1 Open Electrum and go to File > New/Restore.

2 Enter (any) name for your wallet.

3 Select ""Standard Wallet"".

4 Select ""I already have a seed"".

5 Enter your recovery seed. Separate the individual words using spaces (e.g. tree, all, hazard).

6 Click on Options and check ""BIP39 Seed"".

7 Unless you use a passphrase, do not check ""Extend this seed with custom words"". Click on Next.

8 If you used Trezor Wallet before, select p2sh-segwit (or legacy) account.

9 Set up a password or leave the fields empty.

It's safe unless they have physical access to it, and then they need to know how to do it. You will mostly have enough time to move your funds using your passphrase before they even figure out how to do it.;3;1;False;Burns__;fgmhrus;Curious about wallets;ezcfg0;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ezcfg0/curious_about_wallets/
"Trezor (along with every hardware wallet) was originally designed to secure Bitcoin that would be frequently accessed on any computer, without risk of being hacked via malware or keyloggers, etc... They weren't really designed for cold storage although that is their main use case now. 

When you setup a Trezor, it will generate a 24 word seed, it will then ask you if you want to generate a passphrase, which acts as the 25th word of your seed. This should never be written down and should only be memorized (my opinion). Even if a hacker were to gain physical access to your Trezor, they would have to have your passphrase to steal your funds. Other wallets are closed source and most likely vulnerable to other hacks, so nothing is truly safe from hacking.";3;1;False;sreaka;fgmil5a;Curious about wallets;ezcfg0;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ezcfg0/curious_about_wallets/
"It depends on your threat model and alternatives that you may consider. The attack you are probably referring to is the one Kraken posted about in their blog [https://blog.kraken.com/post/3662/kraken-identifies-critical-flaw-in-trezor-hardware-wallets/](https://blog.kraken.com/post/3662/kraken-identifies-critical-flaw-in-trezor-hardware-wallets/)  
To successfully execute this attack and extract your keys the attacker must get a physical access to your Trezor and take it apart, posses a specialized equipment and have some time to run an attack (Kraken reports 15 minutes), so it's not instant. In the most likely scenario your Trezor needs to be stolen first.   


You should understand that you only need to use a wallet when you want to spend your Bitcoin. When you setup a wallet (true for any wallet) it will generate a SEED phrase (12 or 24 words). From that SEED your keys are generated together with your addresses. This process is deterministic, meaning any wallet or software for that matter that knows how to do it can get access to your coins if it knows the original SEED. This is why you always need to write this SEED down and protect it to the best of your abilities. If an attacker get access to your SEED even for 1 second when they can take a picture of it they won't need to hack your Trezor anymore. 

One way to mitigate this Trezor attack would be to erase everything from your Trezor after receiving your Bitcoin. When you need to spend it, you will have to type in your SEED in your Trezor first. 

Another option to protect your Trezor, as recommended by the Trezor team [https://blog.trezor.io/our-response-to-the-read-protection-downgrade-attack-28d23f8949c6](https://blog.trezor.io/our-response-to-the-read-protection-downgrade-attack-28d23f8949c6), would be to use a passphrase together with your SEED. The passphrase is not stored on Trezor hence it cannot be extracted from it. On the other hand, to recover your Bitcoin in case your Trezor is not accessible for you you will need both, the SEED and the passphrase.

If you choose to use a software wallet (mobile or desktop) you open yourself to a possibility of a remote attack since your keys are stored on a general purpose device with large surface of attack and connected to the internet. So even with the know vulnerability Trezor is way safer than any software wallets. On the other hand, if an attacker sees your Trezor, they know you probably have Bitcoin and thus you become a potential target. If they see your phone it doesn't say anything specific about you, unless you wear a hat with a Bitcoin logo on it.

this can be done over a 1 month period by memorizing first 4 words before bed time, then 6, then 8, then 10 etc

only add more words to your memory until you get the first orders/words right (you will have to revisit the written down seed words to confirm they are correct).

target close <-easy, think of a spitfire/pilot

audit barely <- naked accountants

frost gown <- Elsa

myself favorite <- self love, yo

visit summer <- your favorite summer vacation destination

click shift <- starting your lambo

mask predict 
donkey topple <- floating black mask oracle with a donkey falling over 

speed moon 
spell blood <- bitcoin rollercoaster guy to the moon which has blood spelt on it in blood

tent park <- tent city

medal wisdom <- metallica

the idea is to use your own visualized/association ideas that naturally occur within your creative mind when you read the words. associate those visualization with the words and practice repeating them in your head as often as possible (never out loud).

you should be able to do this within a few weeks and then be able to start ryhming back the words in your head easily. eventually the associations will fall off in your mind, and the words will just be there on after the other.

"Here's a presentation I did the other day called ""Getting Started With Bitcoin"".

I usually do more technical talks, but thought it would be useful to do an introduction to Bitcoin for beginners.

Here are the topics I covered:

* What bitcoin is.
* How bitcoins works.
* How to set up a wallet.
* How to make a transaction (and how they work).
* How to check your transaction in a blockchain explorer.
* How to keep your bitcoin secure.

I realize this is below the level of most people here, but thought it might be helpful for anyone who is completely new and looking for an all-in-one walkthrough.

It's just over an hour long, but it should save you some time in the long run if you're new (and there are timelinks if you want to skip to a specific section).

Yeah, it's a little different though because banks can actually print dollars out of thin air.

"Just to clarify, it's not ""my"" list, as in I've not written it nor do vouch for the opinion expressed in it. It's just a list I've found useful when comparing wallet features.

The rating with colors and certain wording (""shitcoins"", ""SX2"") is obviously based on the authors' opinion/bias and should be taken with a grain of salt. You can come to your own judgment/conclusions based on the features you want obviously.

For Trezor's case I think they are judging the software side of it (in browser: see ""Web App"" feature), not the hardware wallet itself (and its firmware). Their web platform does have some shortcomings compared to the competition... mainly it is web-based. I can understand why the author would rather recommend using Electrum or Bitcoin Core with your Trezor hardware wallet for example.

Coinbase (on exchange) is clearly custodial and they don't seem to recommend any custodial wallet, they don't seem to talk about Coinbase Wallet (mobile app) which isn't custodial (but not open-source).

"There is an inherent higher level of trust when you cannot review code that you're running. You base it on the reputation of your vendor at this point... so you're the only one who can decide that level of trust.

Ledger as a relatively good track record in this space in terms of reputation/support and have always had the same policy regarding their code as far as I know (for the closed source part). It's not like they have changed their license from open to close source without any announcement, or stopped releasing code out of the blue.

I don't know Exodus well enough, they don't seem to score very high in the comparative chart I've linked at the bottom of my post. Maybe looking for an alternative that is more open wouldn't be a bad idea, there are plenty of options as you can see.

As pointed out somewhere else in this thread, just having open source and public code isn't enough either. Actual independent audits and reproducible builds (so you know the binaries do match the code that was reviewed) are what's the closest to being trustless. To my knowledge Bitcoin Core would be the safest in this regard, but it's also a more demanding type of wallet (full node).

But in a space filled with software developers, even without formalized independent audits/reproductible builds I would still tend to be more favorable to projects that are open-source with public repositories. If those project get some usage it's highly likely that other software developers have looked at the code before building/running it. Comapred to code that was only ever reviewed internally and most likely never looked at independently, it feels like a more sound security model.";2;0;False;joeknowswhoiam;fgm7dor;"PSA: Bitcoin.com's Wallet new releases do not currently have any publicly available source-code.

There’s been a lot of bad actions on both side. On one hand I understand the issues that BCH folks have with core and the censorship in the subreddits and forums. On the other hand, I don’t think that gives them a right to act the way they do now and take the actions to try to trick noobs into buying their coin by calling it bitcoin. Now I know that isn’t their main intention but it’s definitely a positive to how they have operated. Lots of mud slinging on both sides but I tend to move toward btc side bc spending time in /r/btc with an open mind can be a tough experience. Be prepared to be berated at some point for having any positive karma in /r/bitcoin.;3;0;False;GrilledCheezzy;fgmit7e;"PSA: Bitcoin.com's Wallet new releases do not currently have any publicly available source-code.

The first intuition of many people new to Bitcoin is to mine coins. While it's a great way to understand more about Bitcoin it's not economic to do so anymore at small scale. 

Set up a bitcoin core full node instead to get your feet wet and support the network. 

Spend time to think about how to buy and hodl Bitcoin in a wallet of your choice, with security in place: Verify wallet downloads, avoiding getting coins stolen through malware, getting seed backups done, where to store them, recovery tests...

"No. You misunderstand the theory. The theory does not require everyone to know everything. All it says is that the market price reflects all the information available in the system (ie the system of people who are aware of and potentially willing to buy or sell the particular asset in question). It means that the price represents our collective best guess about what the value of something is / will be (taking into account the time value of money and the time value of the asset). 

I think the best way of thinking about this is that the market is usually and nearly efficient, but not always, since you can clearly beat the market by having information sooner than the rest of the market. However, even this may not contradict the efficient market hypothesis since once you trade, that information will theoretically be taken into account. What i think is missing tho, is the fact that everyone has limits for how many eggs to put in one basket. Even if your 99% sure Bitcoin is going to the Moon soon, you still probably don't want to put 100% of your money into it. This hold back and the fact that the people with the best information may not have enough money to push the value to the ""correct"" level, means that there is some inaccuracy in the market price, but only to the degree that the inaccuracy (in the form of inaccurate information) pervades the market participants.";2;0;False;fresheneesz;fgmh6lb;Paraphrasing a line attributed to Warren Buffet on the dogma of Efficient Market Theory: “The markets are almost always efficient, but the difference between almost and always is $80 billion to me.”;ez7f71;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ez7f71/paraphrasing_a_line_attributed_to_warren_buffet/

"I agree with you that the stock market is not perfectly efficient, but I'm being pedantic since your assertion regarding advertising is not the way to support the case. 

Stocks are priced in a directly decentralized fashion, goods and services are not.  When a good or a service hits sufficient fungibility and liquidity, we call it a commodity. Inefficient markets require advertizing, efficient markets do not. 

The efficient market theory states that ""all available information is represented in the price.""  No such mechanism applies to the price that a company \*sets\* for their products. 

Stocks are priced on an anticipation of future cash flow or price appreciation. Efficient market theory states that the wisdom of the crowd is the most effective tool for estimating value. It's a way to approximate EVERY possible future, weighted for all perceived risks, and coalesce it into 1 figure.

In other words, you don't need to calculate the price of a stock yourself. You can trust that the price of a stock is a representation of all publically available information. 

The price you pay for a wall-mart toaster or a gucci belt has no such mechanism driving the price. It's an element of advertising, supply-chain costs, logistics, convenience, level of urgency, etc etc etc. The price of a wall-mart toaster has nothing to do with how a stock is priced. 

If you can figure out how to buy a toaster 50% lower than market value, that's not that unusual. 

If you can figure out how to buy a stock for 50% lower than market value, you buy it immediately.";1;1;False;GabeNewell_;fgmg4gn;Paraphrasing a line attributed to Warren Buffet on the dogma of Efficient Market Theory: “The markets are almost always efficient, but the difference between almost and always is $80 billion to me.”;ez7f71;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ez7f71/paraphrasing_a_line_attributed_to_warren_buffet/

It is less difficult now to purchase and spend BTC then it was in the earlier days. Case in point. I gave my kids BTC gift cards for Christmas. The eldest downloaded the btc wallet (rise) and proceeded to connect her bank account through another app (Shakepay) to purchase fiat and then convert to BTC. I was surprised at how seemless it was for her.  If you are only buying BTC there is not much to know as an investment. Accumulate daily, weekly or monthly and take advantage of dollar cost averaging. If you want to know the tech behind it and understand crypto and block chain then of course you have a deeper dive.

**Minecraft Players Can Win Bitcoin on New Treasure Hunt Server**

[https://www.coindesk.com/minecraft-players-can-win-bitcoin-on-new-treasure-hunt-server](https://www.coindesk.com/minecraft-players-can-win-bitcoin-on-new-treasure-hunt-server) 

 

**A new Minecraft server allows players in the blocky universe to compete against one another to find hidden treasure and receive a bitcoin reward.**

Known as [SatoshiQuest](http://allaboutbtc.com/SatoshiQuest.html), the challenge is to find the hidden loot within ""vast Minecraft landscapes."" Users pay $1 in bitcoin for an in-game life. Entry fees are collected and most will go towards a specific treasure wallet address, which is awarded to the player who finds the loot first.

In order to participate, users set up their own in-game wallet they can use to pay for lives and receive their winnings. Should they wish, they can also connect an external wallet to the Minecraft game server.

More than 180 million copies of Minecraft have been sold since late 2019, making it the single best-selling video game in history. It allows users to create their own worlds on their own servers. The game has already featured bitcoin, with the [BitQuest](https://www.coindesk.com/minecraft-bitcoin-economy) and [PlayMC](https://www.coindesk.com/kid-friendly-minecraft-server-launches-bitcoin-economy) servers, from 2014 and 2015 respectively, which both integrated the original cryptocurrency to test and educate users about digital currencies.

The first round of SatoshiQuest began on Jan. 26 and the game resets once treasure has been found. The server checks the bitcoin spot price every 15 minutes, automatically updating the participation fee to keep it at $1.

The project is open source, with the code available on [GitHub](https://github.com/BitcoinJake09/SatoshiQuest).

"> How common or realistic is the abuse of ~~RFB~~ RBF?

Common in a specific type of scam promoted on Twitter and Telegram, very realistic. The examples I've seen are usually around $1000  

If the mempools are uncongested, most transactions are confirmed in one or two blocks, making RBF unreliable for the thief. The people doing this as a scam will wait until the transaction backlog is over 10,000 tx  

Also, the recipient has an option to race the RBF replacement transaction with a child-pays-for-parent (CPFP) transaction. CPFP is useful in a restaurant transaction (for example) where a low-fee transaction might be delayed one or two hours. The restaurant can boost the fee with CPFP and avoid asking the customer to wait too long for confirmation. Then if the customer is a thief and the RBF transaction wins the race, demand cash";2;2;False;igadjeed;fgl3125;How dumb would it be to consider a transaction verified with 0 confirmations once it's already been broadcasted to the network for an amount like 50$?;ez3ckk;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ez3ckk/how_dumb_would_it_be_to_consider_a_transaction/

Businesses dealing with credit card payments also have to do risk modeling. Dishonest customers are just a fact of life.

Anyway if you would accept zero-conf you may want to require that the transaction doesn't opt-in to RBF.

This is inline with I'm thinking, though it just doesn't satisfy my itch. If the transaction were for say 1 or 2$, but could be repeated infinitely, could someone benefit from abusing RFB rather easily by repeatedly sending double-spend transactions to a merchant who accepts a payment as soon as the transaction is broadcasted even if it has 0 transactions? Would the hassle of attempting to abuse it be worth a measly 1 or 2$? or does it take too long to attempt multiple times in this fashion? I guess what I'm asking is at what monetary value would it be considered unsafe due to becoming a target of abuse, at what point does  attempting double-spending become more lucrative than say, filling out internet surveys?;1;2;False;ThatSocio;fgkz9s5;How dumb would it be to consider a transaction verified with 0 confirmations once it's already been broadcasted to the network for an amount like 50$?;ez3ckk;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ez3ckk/how_dumb_would_it_be_to_consider_a_transaction/
"Excellent response, I can't believe I didn't think of something so simple! after reading up on it a bit you are right apparently it does in fact have an opt-in, it shouldn't be hard to check it's state in a transaction.

This pretty much kills the easy version of this abuse theorized in OP thus making things relatively safe for a 0 confirmation, in my opinion.

"> could someone benefit from abusing RFB rather easily by repeatedly sending double-spend transactions to a merchant who accepts a payment as soon as the transaction is broadcasted even if it has 0 transactions?

Real case: https://coinnounce.com/bitcoin-atm-fraud-four-canadian-men-declared-wanted/  
These are not $1 thefts, but the point is that the victim did not monitor transactions closely enough to prevent the theft being repeated more than 100 times over 10 days. Best practice for a zero-conf merchant would be to detect every double-spend and instantly suspend zero-conf. Also (obvious in hindsight), a Bitcoin ATM operator should not accept zero-conf for Bitcoin -> cash transactions  

> at what point does attempting double-spending become more lucrative than say, filling out internet surveys

"It's hard to explain to people sometimes that:

* A stock split doesn't mean you doubled your money.
* Cutting a cake into two pieces doesn't mean you get more cake.
* A stock at $999/share isn't necessarily a more highly valued company than one at $1/share, nor vice versa.
* Receiving a tax refund is not a good thing - it's better to receive $0 if taxes were collected accurately.
* Just because someone calls something a thing, it doesn't make it such:
   * ""Democratic People's Republic of North Korea"" (?)
   * ""Patriot Act"" (?)
   * ""Democratic Elections"" (?)
   * ""XRP CryptoCurrency"" (?)

I really don’t even know. I put $165 in my coinbase account from my bank account. I bought $115 of ethereum and sold it later that same day. I also bought some amount of bitcoin that same day and sold it again that same day. I was just sort of playing with it to try to see how it all works, but the ETH just disappeared, it showed where I bought it and where I sold it but the money never came back into my account, I was left with $48.xx in my account after selling the bitcoin, I messaged coinbase support and their first reply just said case # xxxx closed. But my money was still not there so I messaged them again and they proceeded to lock my account. I had already withdrawn all of my money before they did this because it was obviously already pretty sketchy so I wanted my money back before they got anymore. Also they made withdrawals from my bank in weird increments in order to get my original $165, my bank statement showed it being like 2 separate payments of $40, then 1 payment of $80 and then one payment of $5, or something like that, and yes I know for sure it was the real coinbase not a phishing site;1;1;False;fuxwidyahard;fglvtf8;Cash app for bitcoin?;ez1w3p;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ez1w3p/cash_app_for_bitcoin/

"On the other hand, the competition remains paltry with their ranges lower than Tesla’s 2012 model(!). Competitors are not even close to selling at the volume of any of tesla’s models. 

Tesla has an advantage in avoiding costs, such as advertising and dealership middlemen, and also has unique vertical integration (ex: making their own batteries and software). This not only leads a superior cost structure but a better product. Their competitors on the other hand outsource their batteries and drive train. 

Tesla’s chips and scale of data collection are miles ahead, helping them get closer to a reliably safe autopilot. They have an exciting pipeline of products and services that competitors aren’t even working on yet. 

They also are expanding their manufacturing at an fast clip, building a factor in China in under a year, and Germany soon to be next.

ATM and private party can be, but Exchanges usually take time to do account setup.  Also realize (depending on where you live) transferring money to an exchange isn't always instant, so read the fine print.  Also, the more ""instant-ness"" or ""privacy"" you get, generally, the more the transaction costs.

"Bitcoin itself is incredibly fast.

And then after they transcribe your letter to digit format, they send it over the internet which takes 0.0001 seconds.

Email is extremely fast. But handwritten-letter-to-digital-email-transcription is extremely slow.

The old system of money that uses Banks and Checks and Credit Cards is a system chock full of bloatware, crusty old tech, regulations, policies, and other utter nonsense that is not much different from hieroglyphs.

So you need to expect that the process will be hell.

"The first step is to study the market. Since the price of Bitcoin is extremely volatile, it’s important to check its conversion rate in real-time. This will ensure you don’t end up buying or cashing in at the wrong moment.

So the first step is to ensure the timing is right – and that’s where a Bitcoin calculator comes into play. This is essential since Bitcoin calculators show they how much Bitcoin you’ll get for your money. Second, you need to choose the right Cryptocurrency exchange. Important is to find an exchange that supports your chosen Bitcoin trading pair.

On for example [https://www.bitcoin-converter.com](https://www.bitcoin-converter.com/) it is easy to calculate the current Bitcoin price and follow price movements on all major bitcoin exchanges.

Once you’ve selected an exchange, you can sign up for an account with your details and proof of ID.

The next step is to make a deposit into your exchange account. On most exchanges, you select the deposit button, choose your currency, amount and way of transfer the money.

"If you check the price a lot, you will lose money.

Not cause-and-effect, but rather a symptom of a problem. The problem is that if you care about price enough (either in terms of wanting big gains, or afraid of big losses) then your attention and focus is extremely high on ""trading"" more than other activities such as simply spreading awareness of Bitcoin, researching and learning about Bitcoin technology, and other very important things.

Emotionally, you're more likely to be affected by large swings and thus more likely to make trading moves based on them as well. This bodes very poorly, as almost nobody can out-play the market. But many people believe themselves to be the exception to the rule. Casinos love to exploit this overconfidence. The reality is, even if today, you call yourself a committed holder, you tempt yourself unnecessarily with price checking. It's the same as a guy who quit smoking, but leaves a bunch of brand new cartons of cigarettes laying around the house that he looks at every day. Perhaps today he has the discipline. But what about tomorrow, or the next? Perhaps it's just a matter of time, before he breaks. Better to get rid of the cigarettes.

If you really want to be a good HODLer, you'll want to help your own psychology and acknowledge your biology rather than rely on pure discipline. You're human, so there's value in getting rid of temptation.

Over time, with your energy focused on all the millions of reasons why Bitcoin is so great (other than as an investment), you will become so CONFIDENT in Bitcoin that you don't have any reason to check the price.";1;0;False;anon517;fgl4uqu;Checking price;eyxlml;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/eyxlml/checking_price/

"The market doesn’t actually need a nation or any external actor to assign a system of value to it.  The market sells goods and services for whatever people agree upon within the market.

Governments, on the other hand, are basically a meta-market with only one product: themselves.  “We provide the following framework upon which to build your part of the market, at the cost of this many taxes.”  

The only thing that *needs* to be denominated in government dollars is what kind of government you’re buying into.  ‘Goods & services’ and ‘governments’ *should* be two discrete and incompatible markets.

So, as to why bitcoin *can* solve all this on its own?

The sellers of goods & services will decide their preferred method of payment.  In an era where all commerce is increasingly being conducted on the internet across international borders, it’s an easy guess which money they will converge on.

Regarding the other financial goals you alluded to, all you need to do to achieve them is store value in bitcoin. 

>	you need to work for bitcoin, pay tax in bitcoin

You can work for whatever currency is being used where you’re working and paying taxes. Hell, if it’s a leaky debt-based currency like any fiat nation today, it’s better for you to pay your taxes in their currency.

After you spend what you have to to cover your immediate needs (food/clothing/shelter/transportation/entertainment), as long as you save any surplus by converting it to bitcoin, everything else is handled *by* the bitcoin.


>	have pension and 401k in bitcoin


The allure of the stock market comes entirely from the fact that fiat currency constantly loses value, so saving unspent money is not an efficient use of it.  The only way to hit escape velocity away from leaky savings is to participate in someone else’s *selling things for profit* and hope that they continue to figure out how to sell more things every year forever for you to get a part of their profit forever.

Instead of plugging the leak in your savings bucket, you’re willing to ignore it if you can find a flow to replace the amount lost.  You’re ignoring where it’s leaking *to*, though... and that is important.

Bitcoin is really backed on ‘the whole of economics’, which I can expand on in greater detail... but it boils down to: any currency is backed by its monetary base, and the monetary base itself is backed by the goods you can buy with it.  The monetary base has been gold for 5,000 years because it was the best physical thing we had to consistently represent value.  All national currencies used to be based on gold, and that meant that the share of gold you controlled allowed gave you a good sense of how much you could by with it.

But today they aren’t backed by gold, they’re backed by a printer.  When the amount of goods & services available remains constant but your currency is backed by a printer who’s promising not to print any extra for themselves, you have no idea how exactly much your pre-printed currency can buy, but you KNOW it will be less than the person with their hand on the ‘print’ button.  

When your bucket is leaking, it’s the person with their hand on the ‘print’ button that it’s leaking to.

Their ability to profit comes directly as a result of the imperfect coupling between the monetary base and the amount of currency in circulation.

Bitcoin, on the other hand, obliterates this flaw by functioning as both the currency and the monetary base at once.  Ergo, bitcoin is the first currency to be directly backed *by* the goods it buys.  

Temporarily ignoring the fact that we are still in the supply curve and new coins are being mined, this is how the value of bitcoin spontaneously increases any time something new is created:  

I spend time collecting materials and creating something that didn’t exist before.  Something more exists now that can be bought with the same amount of bitcoin that everyone already has.  If everyone created one thing a year, after each year there would be another 7.5 billion things to exchange amongst one another, using the same number of bitcoin... forever.  

You don’t need a pension in this kind of economy because having savings itself is a measure of the surplus value you’ve contributed to society.  And if there’s no more inflation, then technological advancements simply mean things get cheaper over time.  If things get cheaper over time, then a fixed-sized ‘nest egg’ of savings  *is* growing relative to them.";1;0;False;ritmusic2k;fgmm4y8;Find some reasons why bitcoin is needed in this infographic.;eyuyux;https://i.redd.it/phcxxnrteye41.png

**Bitcoin is needed to keep Governments from spending your wealth without permission.**

1. They steal wealth/value from everyone each time that they print more extra dollars... Those ""free"" dollars actually watered the old dollars down a bit, and caused ""inflation""... You know, that pretty word for ""we stole your wealth... but NBD... we only stole a tiny bit from everyone.""
2. Without REAL and proper funding, they are just writing blank checks, burying us in deficit, and mortgaging your future, your children's future, and on and on....

Make the world run on Bitcoin and Noone can ever again do these specific cons on the populous of the world... I'm sure someone will come up with a new con...

"Corporations also have hired record amounts of people recently, because they can afford to do so. So really, there’s a lot of that money going into consumer’s pockets. 

Inflation occurs because more money is printed, further diluting the value of the dollar. It promotes spending now rather than later because your money is worth less in the future.

I know that some of these addresses belong to exchanges and may hold funds that belong to many people.

My point is that I'm not sure if the world will be willing to widely accept a currency 80% of which belongs to 100k people. Some of these guys, who got their 10000 bitcoins for a price of a pizza back in the 2010, would own like 0.05% of GLOBAL wealth which makes them as rich as, say, Zuckerberg or Brin.

"All of the mechanisms for bitcoin to protect itself are based on the idea that miners won’t shoot themselves in the foot because it would result in them losing their investment for some short term profit.  But that assumes there aren’t outside forces...just like the xkcd thing where it doesn’t matter how good your password is if you can threaten someone with a wrench into telling you the password, it doesn’t matter if it wouldn’t make sense for a miner to risk or break everything for some dumb double-spend, if his choice wasn’t internal to bitcoin but between harming bitcoin and going to prison in China or risking the lives of his children or something equally horrible, one could easily imagine someone becoming a ‘bad actor’.  Similarly, if one were rich enough, you could afford to ignore the downsides of a poor outcome if someone within bitcoin passed you off.  The fact that it only takes a handful of people to join together in some kind of threat or promise of greater rewards is bordering on ‘worse than fiat’.  

And 51% is just the threshold, not sure how you think it would be so easy for 49% (or significantly less) to just join up and branch off with no problems.  To some extent it doesn’t even matter if they shifted away relatively unscathed, the actors would still be there with a crapload of processing power and no real way to prevent them from using the new software and doing it again, by which time it might not matter, since it’s the impression of stability that adoption relies on, and something that ‘can’ be taken over doesn’t inspire that.";1;1;False;dnick;fgl4f9y;"""Then strong encryption became available to the masses, and trust was no longer required.

For a simple comparison using the Cash App

OP’s $1 daily purchases for 500 days, with a budget of $500... vs. $10 increments vs. $100 increments.

$1 purchase every day at 10¢ fee = $1.10. Total fees paid for 500 days, $50: 10%

$10 purchase every 10th day at 50¢ fee = $25. Total fees paid for 50 transactions, $25: 5%

$100 purchase every 100th day at $2.23 fee. Total fees paid on 5 transactions, $11.15: 2.23%


Next, a snapshot is a send from Ledger Nano S to a phone wallet address, the same Native Segwit address at the same 10 sat/byte network fee.

"Just posting this here to let folks know I'm working on Orange, a Bitcoin blockchain explorer for Bitcoin Core.

Bitcoin Core provides blockchain exploration through a command line interface. Orange provides a GUI for that command line interface. The goal is to allow a user to download Orange and use it with their Bitcoin Core full-node to explore the blockchain without having to go on a website.

Orange is built with TypeScript, Electron, and React. There are major security concerns with this tech stack. But I believe this is fixable and very strong security can be achieved.

Please note Orange is not meant for public consumption yet. The software is limited, buggy, and hasn't been thoroughly tested. It's going to take awhile to fully build so I wanted to give folks a heads-up of what's in progress. And I would appreciate contributions whether with code or testing.

"Not quite. The price increase happens because the last person that bought a bitcoin (no matter what amount) paid a price for it that was higher than the person before him/her. It is not more than that: the last price someone has paid for a coin.

It is for this reason that volume is also an important factor in evaluating the significance of a price break out. In principle, if you were willing to buy 1 satoshi at a price of 1.000.000 dollar, you singlehandedly brought bitcoin to the moon. Congratulations.

"when more people are trying to buy than sell, The buyers will buy up all the bitcoin at the current price, and a new seller can set there price slightly higher because they know someone will buy it.

Say right now the price of 1 bitcoin is 9650, There are people setting sell orders for bitcoin at 9700, and if all the sell orders cheaper than that one get bought up, the next buyer if he wants it has to buy at 9700, and then a new seller wants the most he can get so he will put a sell order for maybe 9705.

Also, if you use Electrum you should run your own Electrum server. Most (or at least a lot) public Electrum servers are run by chain analysis companies, when you connect to them you expose all your Bitcoin addresses and IP-address. Your Bitcoin is safe, but you lose your privacy completely.;3;0;False;thatcryptoto;fgncakb;Curious about wallets;ezcfg0;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ezcfg0/curious_about_wallets/

When you type in your passphrase, your private key is in plain text on your computer and can be stolen. This is exactly why you need a hardware wallet, it keeps your keys and never shares them with your OS.

"Well considering the reputation/track record of Coinomi and the fact it isn't a custodial wallet (you control your keys) your funds are not at a high risk right now.

But they are on a closed-source wallet, which means that the coders of this wallet are the only ones reviewing/auditing the source code. They could have left intentional/unintentional ways to leak your private keys and only them would know about it.

It is an inferior security model because way less independent people are able to verify/audit the code. Open-source wallets which are not custodial are preferable in general.

Given they run the NYSE and Bakkt, I imagine they’re making a push to compete with Amazon by running their own exchange where people buy and sell goods to each other rather than relying on a central distributor like Amazon.

Would be pretty positive in my opinion, especially if they move away from the auction model and implement something closer to how exchanges work with people listing buy and sell orders.  Would be much more costly to try and edge their way in to online retail than to just buy one with the infrastructure set up.  

The one big hole in online retail is the user can’t list a price they will buy something at and have it fulfilled by someone willing to meet that price.

Since you say you are long term, treat the sale like a mistake.  Fix your mistake, which will cost you since the price has moved up, but that is easy to swallow if you think of it as a cost of the mistake.  Waiting and wishing is making your mistake worse.  You might get lucky, but now you are deliberately making the same mistake (i.e. Not holding BTC when you think it ia good to hold.);2;0;False;Adamsd5;fgn543q;Daily Discussion, February 05, 2020;ez5imh;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ez5imh/daily_discussion_february_05_2020/

It's not anonymizing and attempting to spend your ill-begotten Bitcoin you will have to worry about for the rest of your life - it's the creditors you burn. They're not going to go out of their way for the sake of say 20k, but with any significant amount of debt you become an important and valuable asset to the lender. They will find a way to recoup their investment. As a wise man told me once in my moment of confusion - at the end of the day it's a matter of how much you are attached to keeping both of your kneecaps facing in the same direction.;5;1;False;gdmfsobtc;fgmx03d;Daily Discussion, February 05, 2020;ez5imh;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ez5imh/daily_discussion_february_05_2020/

"how long do you plan on hodling this bitcoin youre about to buy? 

Short term hodling is basically trading. You are spinning the roulette wheel. Hopefully you will get lucky. But this type of scenario is extremely disadvantageous as any type of strong-ish correction or a turn in general sentiment/ bad headline streaks will make you panic and you will sell at a loss. 

&#x200B;

Long term hodling will certainly pay off for you in the long run, purchasing more will make you more committed to learning more, understanding better, and make you more excited about the fact that you are coming in early to the next big revolution happening in the world. Corrections will suck, but wont make you panic sell. 

&#x200B;

Based on your question I presume you have not really thought about how long you plan on hodling. Answer this question to yourself. Otherwise you are taking an action without understanding really why you are doing it, which will not be good for you. This applies really in any area of life.";7;2;False;vitaminBTC;fgmubri;Daily Discussion, February 05, 2020;ez5imh;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ez5imh/daily_discussion_february_05_2020/

Another thing to have in mind is the inevitable fail of fiat as an accounting system or the end of a trusted reference to know exactly how much value does every person/entity own. When people stop believing that the economy is expected to grow in the following years, and it will happen sooner or later, then there will be no way to know what percentatge of credit will be repaid  and no way to respect fiat as a concrete measure of wealth.;2;1;False;nuriaplajas;fgmwj54;Find some reasons why bitcoin is needed in this infographic.;eyuyux;https://i.redd.it/phcxxnrteye41.png
"The fact is, the fed has already prepared their response to this.  They are doing QE4 / ""QE forever"" but hiding it in the repo market.

In order words, they've successfully numbed us to the notion that economic cycles used to be a thing (where growth was the 'good' period in an economy and contraction was the 'bad' thing).

Now, they've effectively pushed the scale so that 'growth at the nominal rate of QE' represents a flat economy and 'growth exceeding the rate of QE' represents an actually growing economy.  Interestingly, with this re-pegged scale, you can measure *actual* economic contraction as 'slowed growth'.

It took way longer than expected and, of course, I was being asked every time why I say that, especially that these two are different type of scams, but either way I'm glad to see more and more people consider BitPay is shit.

Short explanation:

\- Bitpay are Segwit2x signers, thus ANTI-BTC. They also create countless problems for normal, honest users, trying to use their services. You don't have to believe me, just check on google stuff like: ""I have a problem with Bitpay"" or "" I can't pay using Bitpay"" and so on.

\- HitBTC are running on fractional reserve and asking for documents that are impossible to provide in order to lock your account and take all you have claiming that you don't meet the KYC requirements.
