You are replying to a comment that's two days old. This comment bothered no one. And, it was pretty neutral. You on the other hand are behaving like an off kilter shitty day fairy. Nobody was talking to you. There's no reason to be verbally abusive. ;0;0;False;Znees;dq3wfoj;This is why I want bitcoin to hit $10,000;7dpypn;https://i.redd.it/fhzsxgcv9nyz.jpg
Follow proper etiquette. That's it. Quit being a fucking political shill. Nobody cares who you voted for. This is about Bitcoin. Keep it that way.;1;0;False;;dq3rtlz;This is why I want bitcoin to hit $10,000;7dpypn;https://i.redd.it/fhzsxgcv9nyz.jpg

It pretty much is the ultimate limit of divisibility offered.   There are theoretical ways  the protocol's transaction structures could be re-designed to provide more depth in terms of transactable units per BTC,   but it would be a major project requiring breaking changes to the protocol, and a ""flag day"" as it were, to say the least;   afterwards your protocol is fundamentally different from the Bitcoin protocol definition.

It is not likely,  because you're literally talking about a change in the unit of account for BTC.      Such a change would require a complicated hard fork,    since the result would be  a change to transaction entries that is neither forward nor backwards-compatible,  particularly if the number will change from a 64-bitT to a 128-BitT Value,  and old nodes and clients could no longer even read new blockchain entries.

All the Wallets, Nodes, and Miners,   every piece of software would have to be touched   in  a manner that would also be prone to induce bugs  (thus requiring much testing).

To essentially shift  what a   Satoshi means to a smaller fraction of a BTC,   e.g. to make  1 Sat  1/(10^16)  instead of 1/(10^8) .


So you could say in a theoretical sense  it is possible,  BUT in a practical sense,  it  is probably infeasible,  even if there were significant demand.

Have you taken a look to see if I'm still the only problem? Great idea, let's ambiguously bring politics into everything so that nothing gets accomplished. Bravo sir, bravo.;1;1;False;;dq3p9ee;This is why I want bitcoin to hit $10,000;7dpypn;https://i.redd.it/fhzsxgcv9nyz.jpg
Good job, you fucking idiot. Quit bringing politics into fucking everything. Keep that fucking trash where it belongs. Look at what you've done to the whole conversation. You people blow my fucking mind that you cant just follow some simple etiquette and keep your fucking opinion where it belongs.
