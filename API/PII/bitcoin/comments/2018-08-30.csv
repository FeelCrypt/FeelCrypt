"it's mostly used in speculation and as an store of value. usage for daily purchases is very low. some accept bitcoin already though, for example to buy computer games. but adoption is increasing. we are still in the very beginning.

the usual way to get bitcoin is buying it through an exchange. For example localbitcoin, coinbase (US/EU) or gemini (US). after buying more than just for a few bucks to play with, you should use a hardware wallet (Trezor, ledger nano s). Otherwise you can use a less secure hot wallet on your smartphone.";2;1;False;Hanspanzer;e52zwds;Cheers!;9au41d;https://i.redd.it/hmzbd5az5qi11.jpg

History suggests that's a very silly thing to believe

I wasn't saying that it's usable everywhere. I was saying that's it's clearly accepted at some places, unlike the person I responded to who said it can't be used anywhere... ffs, there's an area between no use and full adoption, quit being dense.;0;1;False;;e53h9yl;Cheers!;9au41d;https://i.redd.it/hmzbd5az5qi11.jpg
"As I said above, the point is that 
it's usable at some places, unlike what the person I was responding to was saying. I wasn't trying to illustrate that you can live 100% off crypto, just that it's not wholly useless for payment like the deleted post said. Also, CBD doesn't get you high...";1;0;False;;e53he8k;Cheers!;9au41d;https://i.redd.it/hmzbd5az5qi11.jpg
You said he lived in 2016 because he didn’t know bitcoin could be used at newegg and some Chinese place near you. Don’t tell me to not be dense lol;1;0;False;1wildone1;e54clen;Cheers!;9au41d;https://i.redd.it/hmzbd5az5qi11.jpg
Oh OK thank you. Is it mostly used for gaming purposes at this time or something else? And how do you go about buying this bitcoin? ;1;1;False;amanda0369;e52zhjl;Cheers!;9au41d;https://i.redd.it/hmzbd5az5qi11.jpg
