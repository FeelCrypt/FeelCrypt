"You keep asserting my age but you haven't provided any proof or even explained why it's relevant, not only that but I actually admit my age in some of posts. You're just a typical reactionary with your thumb up your asshole. Then we have the typical ""this is the internet, therefore anything I say goes- even if I contradict myself and admit I'm wrong. Fuck values and logic""";1;1;False;DrRakdos;domlyjs;Bitcoin breaks $5500, less than one day after it broke $5000.;761ri4;https://i.redd.it/f2p8tajk9irz.gif
That's like if you use the n word and i point out it's racist that therefore implies I'm black, or if you call someone a f*g that therefore means I'm gay. It sounds more like you're the young one here , because your critical thinking skills aren't very well developed.;1;1;False;DrRakdos;doml6gz;Bitcoin breaks $5500, less than one day after it broke $5000.;761ri4;https://i.redd.it/f2p8tajk9irz.gif

"Lol. That's the joke. You people don't understand Marxism so we mock you people by mispelling marx, implying you people do it or wouldn't know the difference. And you got pretty upset about it. And also allow me to say, when you say ""what's it like being 14"" that implies you've never been fourteen, therefore meaning you are younger than 14. Kind of puts a damper on the whole ageism thing, dunnit?";1;1;False;DrRakdos;domkhib;Bitcoin breaks $5500, less than one day after it broke $5000.;761ri4;https://i.redd.it/f2p8tajk9irz.gif
You're proud to act like a dumbass. Also, I'm still waiting for your argument and proof. You just asserted something and left it at that without explanation.

Having only a few full nodes seems less bad than not being able to transact.
