"Yeah, hmm.
But what do you mean by power ?   
For instance, muncipalities in my country would very much like more rich people to pay taxes and invest in the local economy and corporations.   
And because of that, the muncipality would do a lot to get them there, overlook laws, let them come in front of others etc.      
And why would corporation spend money on lobbying, if they dont have to?   
Also organizations etc. spends money bribing leaders of countries to great successs.    
I think you have an interesting perspective(and pretty new to me), and would like to learn more about it, do you have any documentaries or books to recommend?    
   
I also dont get why lots of money dont create more money, for instance today, it almost doesnt matter where you put your fiat, almost everything goes up compared to fiat.   (assets/stocks/funds/bitcoin/etc.)     
And the more you have, the more fiat-gain from the investment, but if bitcoin became the world currency that would probarbly change a lot.

And yes, bitcoin will kill stocks and the stock market, if it becomes predominant. What you are not realizing is that big companies are hideously inefficient, and without regulatory and financial moats trey would be eaten alive by smaller competitors.

That's simply not true. Lenders wouldn't lend btc accounting for it's usd value, they would be paid back in bitcoin, so any price swings would be irrelevant, as they would affect your money if you held it instead of lending it.
