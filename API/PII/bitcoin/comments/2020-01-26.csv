So, if the price reaches a certain point, you'll take out a certain amount, make it so that you cash out gradually, whilst also leaving some for future growth potential.

"1) No disagreement!

2) Use a hardware wallet. I would never trust my bitcoin to a third party, and you are right to be wary of them.

3) It all depends how narrowly you define 'use'. Though I personally encourage any/all use paradigms, I feel we are unlikely to see Bitcoin in use as a day-to-day general currency (outside a few niche cases) until robust layer two solutions like LN are mature. And even then, maybe not until a critical mass of the population are also onboard (presumably attracted either by other use cases, or future potential).

"It's fairly straight-forward. The price in a free market is based on supply and demand. Supply is created by people with bitcoins that want to sell them for euros. Demand is created by people withoit bitcoins that want to buy them for euros.

Demand, people wanting to buy, pushes the price up. Supply, people wanting to sell, pushes the price down. 

Now, miners spend electricity and get coins in return. 12.5 coins every 10 minutes, to be precise. Because the miners spent a lot of euros on electricity, they will want to sell some of those new coins.

They provide supply to the market. So they push the price down. Every halvening, the amount of bitcoins the miners get is halved. This also halves the potential supply the miners bring to the market. Which mean that the miners have less pushing power to push the price down.

Which means that, if the demand (i.e. pushing power upwards) stays similar than before the halvening, with less pushing power downwards, the price goes up.";72;5;False;sroose;ffnelqu;ELI5 why does Bitcoin get more valuable after a halvening?;euaql1;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/euaql1/eli5_why_does_bitcoin_get_more_valuable_after_a/
Lol. You gotta be stupid to be a miner. Shit is hard to turn a profit. So, we just stack sats and float the electric bill every month.

Oh. And by the way.  Fiat currencies are always getting inflated.  It's literally the stated goals for the central banks.  There will always be more and more currency chasing fewer and fewer (coins are fixed in overall quantity and get lost over time) coins.  The price of a Bitcoin in dollars is destined to increase forever as long as anyone cares about them at all.;2;0;False;uTOxiOnSOm;ffny59n;ELI5 why does Bitcoin get more valuable after a halvening?;euaql1;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/euaql1/eli5_why_does_bitcoin_get_more_valuable_after_a/
"Um.  All things aren't equal though.  The protocol adjusts the difficulty to adapt to the amount of mining power available.  The goal is to keep blocks getting found at a rate of around 10 to 15 minutes.

Less money coming in?  Miners quit mining.  Difficulty drops.  Remaining miners see their profits go up.

Am equilibrium is maintained mathematically.  In the end, those with the most efficient rigs and cheapest electricity prices will remain profitable while everyone else drops out.

If it always gets more valuable after a halving, it would get more valuable before the halving until it matches the value after the halving. So if it always gets more valuable after a halving, it doesn't get more valuable after a halving. So we just proved it doesn't always get more valuable after a halving.;-1;1;False;sumBTC;ffo39hp;ELI5 why does Bitcoin get more valuable after a halvening?;euaql1;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/euaql1/eli5_why_does_bitcoin_get_more_valuable_after_a/

Miners are the ones who earn half of the Bitcoins after halvening, which doesn't necessarily mean, that the price will double. If people say, the supply halves, they are wrong, because not only miners sell their Bitcoins. What can also happen is that some miners shut down their mining operation cause of a loss of profit, which in turn will lower the difficulty.;0;1;False;DeathThrasher;ffngnlo;ELI5 why does Bitcoin get more valuable after a halvening?;euaql1;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/euaql1/eli5_why_does_bitcoin_get_more_valuable_after_a/

Miners works just as hard for half the reward. It's simple supply and demand. The supply of newly minted Bitcoins is cut in half. If demand remains the same, then there is less supply and thus and increase in price.;2;0;False;sreaka;ffns3r3;ELI5 why does Bitcoin get more valuable after a halvening?;euaql1;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/euaql1/eli5_why_does_bitcoin_get_more_valuable_after_a/

"Now, 1800 BTC is created every day, a lot of which is dumped on the market. After the halving, only 900 BTC will be created and dumped on the market every day. Supply & demand. Or another way to look at it is that there'll be less sell pressure on the order books, so the buy pressure will build up and lead to a new, higher equilibrium.

You'd *expect* the market to price this in gradually and long in advance, but historically it hasn't done so. The price increase after the halving has also tended to happen *some time after* the halving, not immediately.

Since this reduction in daily supply is 900 BTC/day instead of last time's 1800 BTC/day, some people think that the effect will be reduced or non-existent. I tend to think that we'll still see something. Monetary inflation moving from 3.7%/yr to 1.8% is far from nothing, and mined BTC is probably a big chunk of *actively-traded* BTC. On the other hand, the market is more liquid now compared to the last halving, and there are now ways to trade BTC derivatives: you'd expect these changes to make the market more efficient and less volatile. (For example, if you ""know"" that BTC will be much higher a few months after the halving, you could buy call options now, and if lots of people do this, it'd tend to cushion the final effect.) So maybe this time the supply decrease *is* already mostly priced in, unlike in previous halvings. We'll see.";22;2;False;theymos;ffnpqhk;ELI5 why does Bitcoin get more valuable after a halvening?;euaql1;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/euaql1/eli5_why_does_bitcoin_get_more_valuable_after_a/

I fully agree that BTC is here to stay, it's the value and it's use as an investment that I don't believe is guaranteed to stay.  There's no proof it will hit $50k, $100k, $1m, it's all speculation.  A new form of crypto may come out that truly overtakes it in the long run.

Bitcoin shouldn't be your entire savings, or even a large percent of it. It should be a small amount of a diversified investment portfolio. Like 25% at most honestly.

Diversify (not in shitcoins). I had a simple strategy for spending and saving when I was younger. Every time I bought something (other than essentials), I would invest an equal amount in that company. So if I bought an iphone for $600, I would invest $600 in Apple stock.

Agreed, most stocks sand ETFs have done well. But all depends on your strategy. Bitcoin is more unpredictable so taking profits becomes harder. I was way up when it hit 14k last year but about even again now. I didn’t cash our because I took the stance to be patient and HODL until it moons and I double my original stake. Not the best strategy, but works for me and keeps me from losing my mind trying to catch every little run.

The down side to that is the port is open publicly. That adds some risk. You can configure port knocking as one way to keep it closed when not in use. But another way is to use an ssh tunnel. Then you open just one port for that and use it's security (key based login) to tunnel any other ports/applications as needed. Many tutorials out on google.

Ultimately for security you can use a VPN or reverse ssh tunnel to keep public ports closed but allow access only to yourself outside (with some configuration). I use a reverse ssh tunnel so my web server (at a hosting co) has use of my bitcoin node at home.

">How to make sure the recipient is on the same chain?

""Same chain"" effectively means same coin. So as long as you send ""Bitcoin"" from your ""Bitcoin"" wallet to your counterparty's ""Bitcoin"" wallet, you are both on the same chain. Even if a reorg were to happen, it's unlikely to be very deep, that's why you wait for 6 confirmations. And in such case the transaction never happened, so there is no need to worry that you'd send your coins and the counterparty would not receive them. Consensus means that everybody can agree where the coins are - either in your wallet, or in your counterparty's wallet, nothing in between.

Now of course, if you go to ""bitcoin.com"" and get tricked into sending ""Bitcoin"" into ""Bitcoin Cash"" wallet, that's a problem. Because the rules are different, blockchains are different, but your sending wallet has no way of knowing whether somebody holds the private key to the receiving wallet. That's why non-hostile forks also change the format of their addresses, so it becomes impossible to make such mistake.";1;1;False;zzanzare;ffmasws;How to make sure the recipient is on the same chain?;eu7jiq;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/eu7jiq/how_to_make_sure_the_recipient_is_on_the_same/

"Also-- you aren't necessarily sending anyone anything. You're moving bitcoin from address to address. That requires zero effort of the ""counter-party.""

"Sorry to have to be the one to tell you, but TA is just bullshit, worse than useless...  

&#x200B;

First, TA is subjective. As opposed to math or science, with TA everybody gets his/her own ""answer"". It's more like reading tea leaves, palm reading, or visiting a ""psychic"". Of course, the people who pay to visit the psychic will swear that the psychic is real, but it isn't real.  

Second, TA is firmly rooted in bullshit, by professional liars -- desperate stock brokers trying to generate ""**churn**"" (to earn fees) by tricking gullible people into believing that the broker has special knowledge, tools, abilities, etc. Think about it: IF the broker had some sort of advantage, they could quickly become excessively wealthy, but there they are... trying to generate ""**churn**"" to earn fees to pay their bills. I guess they DON'T have a special, market-beating advantage after all.  

Third, TA presumes that tomorrow's price direction depends only upon recent price changes. That presumption is false. Tomorrow's price depends upon tomorrow's supply and tomorrow's demand, which are partly influenced by recent price changes, but mostly influenced by events - events which have nothing whatsoever to do with recent price changes. For example, the leader of a country decides to make a tweet, or some other government announces a new law/policy dealing with Bitcoin and or economics... or a central bank decides to make an announcement about interest rates, QE, etc.

there's a lot of nuance to sarcasm that's visual like eye, facial or hand/arm expressions.  It's really difficult to detect sarcasm in just text form sometimes.

I agree about the nuance, but for me that's part of what makes skillfull deployment of sarcasm so delicious. Smileys, when used to clarify, are in some sense an expression of defeat. Sure they make the intention clear to a wider audience, and that's not a bad thing in isolation, but they're an admission that the resolution of any given interlocution is too potato accurately to convey the desired level of nuance.;3;1;False;Manticlops;ffmpxop;I finally reached my first goal of owning 1% of a Bitcoin;eu6sl9;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/eu6sl9/i_finally_reached_my_first_goal_of_owning_1_of_a/

"Not a lot of chatter here today. Figured I'd add something to discuss. 

Not sure what to make of the market. Anecdotally, I think we'll be moving up pretty soon. 

I honestly think we're too close to the halving for there till be any bearish sentiment, there are more miners than ever and the mining reward is literally going to get cut in half in may-ish. 

So, cool. We're at a healthy 8k. I think those who bought the bottom are not satisfied until after the halving and those who bought at the top already left the space or are waiting for their return. 

So the bottom buyers are happy and the top buyers are gone or patient. I think we had a number of buyers in the 12k range who got excited will be looking for a bitcoin-like return since the bulls are calling for 100k. Maybe we'll get there. Maybe not.

I'm not waiting for a price target but an emotional target. At 16k I think we'll start to see more news coverage etc, we'll break 20k and we're off to the races. 

At that point I think I'll DCA out in the same way I DCA'd in during the bear cycle. I'm just waiting for sentiment to change. Right now, you're still the weird guy that won't shut up about bitcoin - around the halving you'll be that guy that everyone asks for advice about bitcoin - that's when I'll finally shut the fuck up and start taking gains. 

The market will probably get a little wild and it might exceed your own expectations. Which is why its important to DCA. Remember to hold a core hodl position regardless of the sentiment of the space just in case we hear of economic turmoil or war. Remember the real reason for a peaceful global currency. 

But the market will go up - and it will go down. 

Wait until some people get burned. Wait until you're told you're an idiot for believing in bitcoin. Then start buying again. 

The next cycle will be less volatile. We'll have more believers and a more substantiated space. The utility of bitcoin will appear more evident to those who began to research it during the last cycle.

I think we can all agree the bitcoin is an unrealized industry. I can't imagine what kind've services will be built on it (and ethereum). The tech heads know what is possible with bitcoin as a technology - your mother, your boss, your roommate, your girlfriend, everyone you see at the mall, every person you drive by on the road - they have no clue. 

I think we'll eventually see users trading their time in some sortve data mining application (like a video game or something) in exchange for crypto. I'm waiting for some fortnite-like craze where kids are now making money for their passtime. The data collected will be worth more than the currency distributed.

Not sure if it will be btc or eth or some samsung currency or what but, it's safe to say btc will be the most exchangeable and substantiated out of them all. 

Right now the most valuable commodity is data. So we're seeing all the data companies cross into trillion dollar valuations and because that value is not being passed on to the consumers.

Millennials and Gen Z are growing up with a healthy awareness of how valuable their personal data is. We'll eventually see companies who are willing to operate as billion dollar valuations to pass the value back to the consumer. You'll eventually be paid for performing what people consider pastimes now. Crypto makes all of this possible without someone needing to cut a check. 

It'll change the world in an internet-like fashion. Competing currencies will ensure bitcoin never has a return like it once did, but I do believe it will be regarded in the same way gold is to paper money.

So anyway that's what I think. Let me know if I'm totally off base, not entirely original but I think it's pretty rounded. Thinking about starting a channel to cover some of these ideas in depth. I'm just afraid I'm not knowledgeable enough.";20;3;False;doobur;ffn6zim;Daily Discussion, January 26, 2020;eu5zzk;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/eu5zzk/daily_discussion_january_26_2020/

"A ""blockchain"" is just an awkwardly structured database, if it doesn't come with cryptography, economic incentives to mine the blocks (which keeps it secure), incentives to users to use it (or giving it value by holding the actual coins etc), for developers to contribute for whatever reasons (monetary, ideological, ""for fun"" etc). It's also worthless if its contents are not easily verifiable by anyone wishing to do so (f.ex if the costs for verification are very high).

IMO there are a very large number of people who use the term without understanding what it is. For bitcoin, it is a large merkle tree structured, cryptographically secure, distributed database, secured by a proof of work algorithm with built in economic incentives for distribution of wealth to participants working to verify transactions.

This eliminates middlemen in the sense that people no longer need banks to store, secure, and transfer their wealth, but that’s where it ends.

Bitcoin is wildly successful because it has shown to work for that specific purpose, a purpose that the first ‘blockchain’ was specifically built for.

No blockchain has shown efficacy for any practical use other than value transfer thus far. Right now your understanding of this technology is in line with most people who only have a cursory understanding of it.

"I was recently reading a debate about the rise of job agencies or recruitment agencies having a detrimental effect on real wage growth because jobs controlled by them also mean wages controlled by them.

Basically companies who recruit staff through said agencies pay a premium and the agencies charge a fee for finding the candidates for the job roles advertised.

Go back 15 years or so and companies advertised direct for the staff, so we are IMO living in a world where middle men companies have become a tool that in reality are not needed but for some bizarre reason have become accepted.

If you can take away their role as middle men the employer and employee can become better off by eliminating their percentage.

Also if you look closely at other industries there is a real need to eliminate middle men blood suckers for the good of society.

My overall view is maybe Blockchains in some form can not only do that but if also crypto is used as a payment settlement on those fees or wages to employees this could be a great move going forward.

"But this isn't exactly the question of OP - he would want to know how many dollars have actually been paid for all bitcoins minted already, without having been paid back. The cost of the miners wouldn't be relevant for this question, and those bitcoins which have been minted but not yet sold by the miners would have to be excluded as well. 

If a miner sold a bitcoin for 8k, and the buyer still has this bitcoin, the 8k are still bound in the bitcoin market. Now if I got the logic right (and looking at what you said) all the transactions of the same bitcoin would be irrelevant except the last one: Regardless of whether the next guy would buy this same bitcoin for 10k, or for 6k, this last amount would be the money bound in the crypto market. This would ""simplify"" the task, it's only necessary to find out the last amount of money paid for each bitcoin. It's a really important difference to the market cap, because all bitcoins never sold, especially the first million and all those still held by miners, are not counted. And, all bitcoins held after having been bought have to be valuated with the historical price which has been actually paid.

TL;DR: So the theoretical approach is in my last sentence: To summarize the actual money bound in the bitcoin market, it would be required to identify the last amount of money paid for each single bitcoin.

"Good Analysis. One concrete question though:

Assume Alice buys 1 BTC for 8k from a miner. Then later she sells it for 10k to Bob.

--> Does this count as     
(a) 8k+10k=18k,     
(b) 10k, or    
(c) 8k still?

The OP seems to think of (a), you think of (b) which I think is more meaningfull. But also (c) has its justification, because it only counts the initial purchase and hence the fiat money flow into the real (miner-) economy and all later exchanges are neutral.

To make this clearer, assume Alice who bought 1BTC for 8k from a miner sells 1 BTC for 10k to Bob. One week later Bob sells the same BTC back to Alice for again 10k.

Now depending on the evaluation philosopy we get:     
(a) 8k+10k+10k=28k,     
(b) 10k still, or    
(c) 8k still.

For (b) one may ask ""why"", because the two last transactions cancel out each other, but without those it would have counted as 8k, so why not still count it as 8k, which would come down to (c).";2;1;False;Amichateur;fflkfqx;How can you find out how much fiat money has been exchanged for cryptocurrencies in total?

">If a miner sold a bitcoin for 8k, and the buyer still has this bitcoin, the 8k are still bound in the bitcoin market.

How so? The 8k will be out of the Bitcoin market and with the miner. It is not bound to the Bitcoin market at all.

In a sense, total of all bids in all exchanges can be said to be bound to the bitcoin market. After considering stops and liquidations, this figure can be meaningful.

Cell phones? Remember carrying around a brick? Now you can buy a decent phone for $200 that has more processing power (way more) than the first space shuttle and you can access any piece of information in the world you want... and it's in your pocket.

Computers? Clunky valves, to ones that filled a room, to old two colours, now we have 144hz+ UHD widescreen with so much processing power that they are used to solve various diseases among other things.

Eftpos/electronic card terminals. Can you remember taking a credit card imprint to being able to 'tap' a card anywhere in the world and have the transaction approved in seconds taking money from your bank in another country.

"All of these worries are things that grow only in the absence of information. So whenever you start thinking e.g. 'why has this thing not caught on completely yet?', a mental dialogue box should pop up, saying something like 'woah there, we're 11 years in, and people are paying over $8k for strings of numbers'. Eight fucking K though!

Not that the price is even the right way to understand the situation. Once you have a good understanding of the technical & social underpinnings, none of the problems/threats you perceive & list seem remotely relevant.

Joe Schmo says whatever he's told to say, and feels clever for doing so, but he has no actual dog in the fight. When he's told to get some, he will, with no memory of his previous antipathy. He'll think 'boy, am I smart to be buying bitcoin. Everybody else is doing it, so it feels right'.

Few businesses accept it, but honestly, Bitcoin is not ready for anything more until robust payment layers exist. ATMs are a stepping stone, again, not reflective of anything close to Bitcoin's final form. MFs might dump it, but you've been hodling for a long time. You know what happens next.

If something better comes along, we'll recognise it instantly (Bitcoiners are not pushing a fantasy like altcoiners have to, we are clear-eyed about the benefits of competing tech), and steal it. Many orders of magnitude easier to do that, than for the new tech to initiate a userbase the size of bitcoin's. Network effects are particularly strong in monies.

I'm not certain Bitcoin will make it. There are non-trivial hurdles ahead for sure (e.g. scaling, or keeping the users sufficiently defensive of Bitcoin's properties that they could resist a better-worked, government-backed, bcash-style putsch).

But I am sure Bitcoin is the only thing of its kind, and no competitor can win if Bitcoin doesn't.

"The breakeven cost of the electricity alone on an Antminer S17 is under about 15 cents per kWh.

For an S15 it is under about 10 cents.

For an S9 it is under about 5.5 cents.

So if you have an S17 miner and electricity at 10 cents per kWh the mining cost is about $5-6,000.

If you have an S9 and your electricity costs 10 cents per kWh the electricity cost per bitcoin is about $15,000 or twice the value of a bitcoin.  You go broke.

If your electricity is 10 cents per kWh you will need a very efficient miner to break even, for example an S17.  You will loose money with a cheapish miner.

"Is NOT paywalled:

> In narrow terms, the economic sanctions imposed by the United States on Iran in the last two years have been effective, shrinking the Iranian economy by 10 to 20 percent. But they have also accelerated Iran’s use of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, which are increasingly used by the Iranian government and public to evade legal barriers. This has led to an attempted crackdown on bitcoin by international regulators—but the cryptocurrency industry is proving more nimble than the enforcers of sanctions.
> 
> The Iranian government has long had an interest in using cryptocurrencies to support international trade outside of the traditional banking system. In July 2018, President Hassan Rouhani’s administration declared its intention of launching a national cryptocurrency; one month later, a news agency affiliated with the Central Bank of Iran outlined multiple features of the national cryptocurrency, stating that it would be backed by the rial—Iran’s national currency. Multiple blockchain projects—developing the underlying technology for cryptocurrencies—were revealed by the central bank at a digital payments conference last year, one of which is reportedly already being tested by four Iranian banks (three of which are under sanctions).
> 
> Cryptocurrency transactions are already popular with the Iranian public, according to various reports. In some interviews, people have described bitcoin as the only way to get money out of Iran. Cryptocurrency mining activity, which is a heavy computational process that generates, or “mines,” new cryptocurrency, is also significant in Iran. Lured by the cheap cost of electricity in the country, and the devaluation of the Iranian rial, several bitcoin miners set up operations in Iran in 2018. In 2019, a survey conducted with 1,650 Iranians using bitcoin showed that 25 percent of respondents made $500 to $3,000 per month working with cryptocurrency. The Iranian government also appears to have recognized the value in mining as an economic sector. In August 2019, after a month of harsh crackdowns on mining activity for abusing cheap electricity, the cabinet issued a regulation that recognized mining as a legal sector in the economy.
> 
> Interestingly, Iran also appears to have attracted interest from other countries willing to collaborate via blockchain platforms. In 2017, Sweden reportedly authorized a local start-up to invest in firms on the Iranian stock market by using bitcoin. In November 2018, Iranian and Russian blockchain industry personnel signed an agreement for cooperation in developing Iran’s blockchain industry, with a stated aim to address challenges arising from sanctions. In 2019, Iran’s Trade Promotion Organization conducted negotiations on the use of cryptocurrencies in financial transactions with representatives of eight countries, including Switzerland, South Africa, France, England, Russia, Austria, Germany, and Bosnia-Herzegovina. In 2016, as per the Iran nuclear deal, the United Nations and European Union lifted sanctions on Iran. The EU recently launched Instex, a transactions channel between Europe and Iran.
> 
> Multiple obstacles still exist, however, before Iran can fully harness the power of cryptocurrencies. The room for anonymity is steadily shrinking for cryptocurrency transactions as formal identification of customers through “know your customer” (KYC) compliance rises globally. In 2018, the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control added two Iranian individuals and their bitcoin addresses to its Specially Designated Nationals List. According to forensic analysis by the Treasury Department, more than 7,000 bitcoin transactions valuing millions of dollars had been processed by these addresses. Apart from other criminal activity such as the Silk Road case and numerous scams, cryptocurrency usage by regimes such as Venezuela and Iran has been one of the driving factors for heavy regulation of the sector.
> 
> Apart from country-specific regulations that mandate financial compliance, the Financial Action Task Force’s standards were set in 2019 and are now enforced across 37 member countries. These standards impose full KYC compliance at the level of virtual asset service providers, as well as a “travel rule” that requires both originators and beneficiaries of cryptocurrency transactions to identify and report suspicious information. These regulations effectively exclude Iran from major cryptocurrency exchanges. This has tilted the Iranian cryptomarket toward local exchanges, where price premiums on the currency are higher. Iran is thus losing out on its competitiveness in mining compared with other jurisdictions. While electricity costs are lower, other costs related to mining, such as hardware and operations, are much higher in Iran. Meanwhile, there is still regulatory uncertainty over the future of cryptocurrency within Iran.
> 
> Despite these challenges, there are new developments in the world of cryptocurrency that may open up new possibilities for the Iranian government and people to evade sanctions. One significant development is the rise of central bank digital currencies, which are the governmental take on cryptocurrencies—central banks issuing natively digital money. China and Russia have notably been working on these projects for some time, and the Chinese sovereign coin, or “digital yuan,” is expected to be launched this year. The implications for international sanctions are vast. First, these projects inevitably run on private blockchains that provide no traceability to outside countries the way a bitcoin network does. The second is that these instruments are completely outside the purview of current U.S.-led global financial architecture. Countries that are still open to cooperating with Iran could easily explore avenues through the use of such sovereign coins.
> 
> Another more significant industry-led development is decentralized finance. Popularly referred to as “DeFi,” this rising class of cryptocurrency projects aims to provide traditional financial services such as banking, lending, and trading over decentralized networks and without intermediaries. These expand significantly on the financial options available for ordinary citizens to services beyond just payments, which is what bitcoin currently offers. For example, Iran has been facing record-high inflation since 2019, but by using DeFi, Iranians can borrow from global markets at rates much lower than those inside Iran. Leveraging decentralized exchanges can also help the regime convert cryptocurrencies to fiat through channels that cannot be effectively controlled by outside regulators. The decentralized nature of these platforms makes them difficult to regulate as effectively as centralized exchanges.
> 
> DeFi still offers challenges for would-be sanctions evaders. These channels cannot offer very high liquidity as compared with large centralized cryptocurrency exchanges. The entire outstanding market cap for DeFi is estimated at around $430 million, and handling trades of $10 million to $20 million becomes challenging through these platforms. The Iranian regime might also deter access to DeFi for citizens by imposing harsh punishment, as it can pose a significant capital flight risk for the economy. On the industry side, the DeFi community leans heavily toward transparency, and all transactions are recorded in a blockchain, which can be subject to forensic analyses similar to bitcoin. Most service providers additionally undertake significant checks from their side to limit illicit activity through their platforms and avoid regulatory noncompliance.
> 
> Iran has clearly understood that cryptocurrencies are among the ways to challenge and subvert the U.S.-dominated financial architecture. Closing off these channels effectively will take global coordination and cooperation with cryptocurrency service providers; both global and Iranian regulations will determine the degree of access to these avenues. In the meantime, as long as holes in regulation exist, they are sure to be exploited by the Iranian regime and people.";6;2;False;simplelifestyle;ffkf8cb;Iran Has a Bitcoin Strategy to Beat Trump's Maximum Pressure;eu1vt4;https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/01/24/iran-bitcoin-strategy-cryptocurrency-blockchain-sanctions/

I would recommend that you use Paxful. It’s more expensive because you’re not giving away your identity and it’s anonymous, plus you have several methods such as debit/credit card, Amazon Gift Card, in person exchange, etc. I would recommend to withdraw cash from an ATM and buy Amazon Gift cards to buy BTC in Paxful. Do not buy the gift cards using credit or debit card since that gives your identity away and no one will accept it. When you use Amazon Gift cards it is anonymous and safe but is 20% more expensive. However, BTC is deflationary so you’ll just have to wait a little longer for the price to accommodate to the value. You’ll have the benefit of owning BTC without any exchanger knowing your identity which is priceless.;2;0;False;juls89;ffjq0s7;Apps for buying BTC?;etzlxp;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/etzlxp/apps_for_buying_btc/

It is 2048 words so the number of trials needed is approx. 2048^N where N is missing word count. The last word partially holds some check bits so missing it is less important.

Most hw wallets use 24 words but you can and should add a passphrase to that. It can be anything (not just from word list) and the more complex the better. Each passphrase added will create a different wallet so you can have many including <blank> which is the same as not using one. A passphrase actually changes the generated wallet key list.

"Read the other comments. The word list is standard, with options for several non-English languages

> I'm just trying to figure out how to safely store crypto

Your wallet probably has a 24-word seed phrase and an option to add a ""25th word"". See this document: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki  
Scroll down to ""From mnemonic to seed""  

> A user may decide to protect their mnemonic with a passphrase

This passphrase is sometimes referred to as ""25th word"". It should be a multi-word passphrase, not a single word. Use a technique like [Diceware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diceware) to generate a 7-word passphrase. Write down the 24 word seed phrase. Memorize the passphrase. Do not write both phrases in the same place. If you trust your memory, do not write the passphrase anywhere

"Well. There is no hardwarewallet I know of which gives you the standardized option of having a 22 or 25 word seed. 

Afaik any reputable hardwarewallet has a 24 words seed, following the rules of BIP39. Basically there's a list of 2048 words of which your seed is made of. There were and are some wallets which also let you use a seed length of 18 or 12 words but creating 24 words seeds today is state of the art.

Your way of improving the security by leaving out a certain number of words to be written down works but is not really effective in fact it can be quite vulnerable. Depending on what exactly you did there it's more or less easy to script-guess the missing words in case somebody finds your seed. I recommend you to look into the option of adding a passphrase to your seed, the so-called 25th seed word which actually isn't really a seed word.

It can be chosen completely free and doesn't have to be part of the actual 2048 wordlist. Nevertheless adding the passphrase to your seed is also a standardized option defined in the BIP39. If you look for [Ian Coleman's BIP39 Tool ](https://iancoleman.io/bip39/) you'll find there's a passphrase field where your passphrase of choice can be added. Ledger wallet for example also supports adding a passphrase and thus alters security dozens if not hundreds fold.

This way you would have to write down your 24 seed words and remember or write down *separately* your freely choose passphrase. Both of them are practically worthless when having them alone. You'll have to have  both, the 24 word seed *and* the passphrase to gain access to the stored funds.

But you have to understand: Adding a passphrase to a 24 words seed creates a *completely different set of keys*. It's a whole new wallet when the passphrase is added. This security can hardly be beaten, in any case not by your method of leaving some words out to be written down. Don't do that. It's a method poised to fail and to be running into issues. Just add a passphrase (remembered or written down separately) and that's it.

For more information on this topic look into the videos of /u/crypto-guide, especially into [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5nejoEGWFw) to understand a bit more about seed phrases/mnemonics/24 words and into [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6jvThGHVzc) for in-depth view into using an additional *secure* word as passphrase.

The only difference is that half a seed phrase might have 12 words, whereas if they have one entire seed phrase of two they're going to be missing 24 words. Otherwise there is no difference at all.

"First, TA is subjective. As opposed to math or science, with TA everybody gets his/her own ""answer"". It's more like reading tea leaves, palm reading, or visiting a ""psychic"". Of course, the people who pay to visit the psychic will swear that the psychic is real, but it isn't real.

Second, TA is firmly rooted in bullshit, by professional liars -- desperate stock brokers trying to generate ""churn"" (to earn fees) by tricking gullible people into believing that the broker has special knowledge, tools, abilities, etc. Think about it: IF the broker had some sort of advantage, they could quickly become excessively wealthy, but there they are... trying to generate ""churn"" to earn fees to pay their bills. I guess they DON'T have a special, market-beating advantage after all.

Third, TA presumes that tomorrow's price direction depends only upon recent price changes. That presumption is false. Tomorrow's price depends upon tomorrow's supply and tomorrow's demand, which are partly influenced by recent price changes, but mostly influenced by events - events which have nothing whatsoever to do with recent price changes. For example, the leader of a country decides to make a tweet, or some other government announces a new law/policy dealing with Bitcoin and or economics... or a central bank decides to make an announcement about interest rates, QE, etc.

Nobody will build or use second layers if the blockchain isn't secure. Bitcoin will not be worth anything, because it doesn't work anymore.

So holding bitcoin comes with a liability, a constant & expensive burden that must be fulfilled? No, it would quickly become 'proof of stake' in such a situation, and that does not provide the same assurances as PoW, while introducing a number of new attack vectors (not going to get into this here, dyor).

There may be a way around it, but nobody has found it yet. Until they do: Fees for on-chain tx will need to step in & replace the block subsidy, or Bitcoin will cease to exist.

It's not a bad thing, but an intended part of the design. This early stage of handing out newly minted bitcoin with every block is just priming the pump, a way to get the system kick-started.

"Whenever a block is found, approximately every 10 minutes, the miner who finds the block gets to add an extra transaction to the block that gives themselves some bitcoin, which is their reward for finding the block solution.  This is the mechanism  for how bitcoin is  created. Originally this reward was 50 BTC per block.  Every 210,000 blocks the reward gets cut in half.

Well done for getting you coins off an exchange .

However please make sure you understand your new wallet . If it has a 12 or 24 seed password please keep that very safe and never show it to anybody or enter it into a website . As anybody who has that info can steal all your money . Do not lose the seeds words as there is not forgot password option with a wallet.

As you are new a nice and easy wallet for you pc is exodus wallet. Plus it holds many other coins like lite coin and etherum

"Yes. The only thing that changes is that you may lose a small amount for each transaction (usually less than 5 cents worth of bitcoin per transaction depending on how quickly you want it to be confirmed). This is due to miners fees, and is usually determined by whichever exchange or service you are receiving bitcoins to your wallet from. Some services might allow you to set the miner fees to be lower, but it will take longer for the transaction to confirm.

Other than that, a bitcoin is a bitcoin is a bitcoin; the price is only determined by whichever exchange or service you are buying or selling it with; transferring it to a wallet does not change the inherent value.

If you've never actually transferred bitcoin to a wallet you own before, try transferring a small amount as a test to make sure it goes smoothly and to make sure you've entered your address and other information in correctly.

And of course, make sure to follow good practices with your wallet; keep your secret backup phrase recorded in a safe place in case you lose the device you are using as your wallet, don't install any sketchy apps or software on said device, use encryption, etc. If you are holding large amounts of bitcoin (ie: more than a couple of hundred dollars worth), avoid using a wallet app on a smartphone or computer connected to the internet , and instead invest in a dedicated hardware wallet.";-1;0;False;SlapDashSassafras;ffjbj6c;If I transfer my bitcoins from the exchange to my wallet will the value still fluctuate with the price of the coin?;etxzlg;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/etxzlg/if_i_transfer_my_bitcoins_from_the_exchange_to_my/

"I understand where you are coming from but saying what you are saying is like asking people in 1910 to stop measuring car performance on Horsepower.

The point of USD is also to make transactions and it has become the world's most-used currency. Bitcoin is money and as money, its value is measured in various markets so people know how much it is worth during an exchange.

It's great that many people are most interested in development. Sometimes these people seem to get annoyed by some vocal investors who get their excitement from the price fluctuations - then we get posts like this.

But in their complaints they forget that Bitcoin is a currency with a value to be measured and a limited total supply that results in an overall increasing price as adoption approaches maximum.

This attracts speculation and excitement as well as the opposite and because we are all human, we get market cycles in Bitcoin because of human psychology. Anyone who thinks we would have a straight line slowly going up or static price is a fool. Only in the result of actual mass adoption would we have a stable Bitcoin. Unless everyone uses it (in an area) you need a sense of value. You want to know Yen in USD because you don't use Yen. But if you moved to Japan, you'd start to think in terms of the prices you see everywhere.

So who cares? Everyone. Speculators care because they trade it vs USD. Investors care because they are invested in it. Shop owners care because they need to have a sense of value. Customers care because not much is priced in BTC.

When I see people posting regarding price, I've never thought that they were measuring its success. I've always thought they were measuring their investment success. And that is a segment of the Bitcoin users.

We can make a fair comparison to the tech bubble. This was a bubble caused by over-excitement towards new technology. You could ask the same questions about that and they would be more valid. More valid because unlike those technologies, Bitcoin is itself money but not only that it is also an extensible way of building money services. You cannot separate this like you can separate technology stocks from technology or you end up with a closed view on Bitcoin's abilities.

I guess my point is not everyone is you. Everyone is here for a different reason. And all those reasons are valid!

"> using a stablecoin just moves the counterparty risk to the stablecoin provider

Yes indeed, that's what's great about it. You as someone selling bitcoin wouldn't need to worry about that risk, and it would make the process a bazillion times faster (since you don't have to wait to see if your payment method gets charged back or revoked or whatever). 

Obviously I'm not telling people they should store any value in a stable coin for long, but doing it for the period of time it takes to make a trade is absolutely practical. Its also unlikely that the stablecoin provider just suddenly refuses to honor the contract of those stablecoins.

"You need to look into bitcoin's history and pick for yourself the flavour of bitcoin you want to support. In other words: what is to you the real bitcoin. For different people that will be a different answer. Don't go for personalities. Go for ideology: what is to you the most important thing. Do you support Bitcoin being a privacy coin? Are you okay with scaling off chain? Many factors should come into play.  


Also, If you're gonna have much more than $100 invested, consider getting a ledger or a Trezor. Do not leave your money in exchanges. Learn/understand what is a private key, what is a seed, what is a hot/cold wallet. And then make the decision for yourself. Don't jump on bandwagons or we'll have a brainless bitcoin going in just about any direction. Developing without economic purpose. 

Plus if you leave your money on an exchange, if further forks or distributions happen, you're very likely to get 0. You're very likely to at some point see zero balance and you're very likely to see your funds seized by some government since that's technically a security.

I don't think this is true and would be interested in some statistics examining it, but closed source projects don't release the data necessary for comparison. Open source projects get much more eyes on them than closed sourced one's do. It's sadly not uncommon for closed source projects to include vulnerabilities which would be caught on basic code review or audit, the kind of vulnerabilities which are frequently found by an interested public or crowdfunded professional audit - the kind a company can't be bothered to pay for or organize. As a general rule of thumb large FOSS projects have to be more organized and diligent than large closed source projects which often end up under funded monolithic messes.

There are more and more methods to test chips against common faults that have been handled by smartcard chips for over 40 years (for example https://github.com/newaetech/chipwhisperer for side channel analysis, https://github.com/Ledger-Donjon/scaffold for fault attacks) that let you verify that general purpose chips will be vulnerable to those attacks while smartcard chips aren't. You can conclude something else from those tests if you want but that'd be pretty much just your belief.

> 
I don't get your point. Are you saying Ledger use multiple manufacturers (of, for example, the secure element)?

I'm saying that usually a company designs a product, and gets it manufactured by third parties. Typically nobody designs its own PCB, and as you grow you delegate more and more parts. Using a chip that guarantees a root of trust to the manufacturer let you do that in a flexible way without compromising the software integrity.

> It is not ideal, but doesn't mean it wouldn't work.

In this specific case it didn't really. See issues 5 and 8 on https://trezor.io/security/ - it's just whack'a'moling around the problem.

"It depends on why you bought bitcoin.

If you bought bitcoin because you're mad about banks, then you're just using coinbase as yet another bank.

If you bought bitcoin so you can safely make anonymous purchases, coinbase is probably tracking at least the next couple of wallet addresses you send that bitcoin to.

If you bought bitcoin to speculate on its price, and you understand that like any other exchange like Bitfinex, QuadriagaCX, or Mt Gox you run the risk of this business suddenly becoming insolvent without warning, then yeah feel free to keep your bitcoin there as long as you understand the risks, or take steps to mitigate risk by storing a portion of your bitcoin in a personal wallet you've created with private keys you control.

If you go this route, I'd recommend a cold storage option. This can include:

* An air-gapped Linux PC that has Electrum wallet installed.
* Paper wallets that have been generated by a similar air-gapped Linux PC.
* A hardware wallet.
* Using physical dice to generate your own private keys.

"Half-baked  
The node network is too big and too sleepy to respond quickly to any emergency. There's no way any fork could be implemented in under 3 weeks, and 3 months would be more likely  

Here's a more interesting half-baked idea  
Implement 20 hashing algorithms in parallel, each one with it's own difficulty, so that miners in each algorithm are competing to find a hash, and each algorithm is competing with the other 19  

Then you could have CPU miners, GPU miners and ASICs all with different amounts of hashing power, and each algorithm with the same chance of finding a block  

Not an emergency proposal, this fork could be implemented in the normal course of Bitcoin improvements

But not turn by turn?  
It would be simple to number the algorithms from 0 to n-1, calculate modulus-n (prevhash), and use the result to choose the algorithm for the next block  

Or, have all the algorithms hashing in parallel, in competition, but with a rule that the same algorithm can not win 2 blocks in a row. Then the winning algorithm is determined by the same pseudo-random process as the current single-algorithm mechanism.

"Gonna risk showing my ignorance here, but here it goes...
 
The money our (USA) govt borrows from the FED doesn’t exist until the moment we borrow it; it’s printed into existence and backed by nothing. We owe all of that money back, including the interest, except that the FED never printed any additional money to BE the interest. That extra money as interest comes from the nation itself, the people in it, our possessions, etc. so it’s a scam to funnel money out of the nation into the hands of the elite banking institutions, whoever that happens to be. 

Having said that, it seems to me that a negative interest rate wouldn’t hurt these people, not really. Imagine if the US borrowed 1 trillion, and only paid back 1 million of it. That’s still a million bucks for doing nothing except turning on a machine and letting it run for a few days while reserving the right to be the only person/people in the world who are allowed to turn it on in the first place. So that’s what? A negative 99.9999% interest rate? Something like that. 

So is the problem just the inflation caused by such an arrangement? The fallout of debt forgiveness that massive? What am I missing here?

"**Stall (fluid dynamics)**

In fluid dynamics, a stall is a reduction in the lift coefficient generated by a foil as angle of attack increases. This occurs when the critical angle of attack of the foil is exceeded.  The critical angle of attack is typically about 15 degrees, but it may vary significantly depending on the fluid, foil, and Reynolds number.

Stalls in fixed-wing flight are often experienced as a sudden reduction in lift as the pilot increases the wing's angle of attack and exceeds its critical angle of attack (which may be due to slowing down below stall speed in level flight).

They choose to give it to you with some delays, or not give it to you at all, when you ask. As is their prerogative they are their coins. The bitcoin protocol is explicit about defining ownership. You can find countless people complaining Coinbase seized ""their"" coins or held them against their will.

"Listen, I get all of this and even agree but it's a bit deeper than that. Reputation is important for a market/product and crypto has an abysmal rep, that has only been nuanced further since it hit the mainstream back in 17. This is understood by those who arent deaf but it gets even deeper. 

Investors will pay a premium for a less risky product, so while the price will be high at the point where we reach mainstream acceptance, how long until we get there is still a variable that's hard to quantify. 

As an example it took the ETF market rougly 25 years to reach a trillion dollar market cap. Let's say this was the case for crypto to achieve a sustained trillion dollar market cap with btc being 40% of the market. 

In this scenario we'd have to wait about 15 years to reach a sustained price slightly above ATH. Just play this out in your head for a second, obviously this is hypothetical babble, but if this was how it played out, how many people do you think would still be interested who consider themselves permabulls? 

As you mentioned, if this is a slice of a larger portfolio then you wouldn't care in theory, the same way short funds bleed money, and are simply used as an insurance policy for a long portfolio. 

But I think we can both agree that's far from the case for most in this space, and time is becoming the real pressure variable for many.

We can discuss this for hours, analyzing different individual economic situations, personal interest/expectations, length in market, price, investment experience, trading vs investing, overextended/underfunded or not, primary income source etc. 

But in the grand scheme of things, I think if we simply look at the hyper sensitivity to price swings, the click bait type projections, reaching articles, sentiment/ideas/expectations of those in the space, among the myriad of other information we have, you can conclude most in the space are dumb money to put it simple.

"I've got a few trust issues I'd have to shake to go with zcash to start off with. I'm not sure how much I can buy a trusted setup from a super small group of pals to throw away the keys to unlimited fortune last the way through those first couple upgrades.

But opinions aside, you're not wrong about the Anon set being smaller. But similarly, the smaller Anon set that is chosen from is logarithmically harder to narrow down the further you could randomly link until the Anon set is the full supply. So basically, after a few lucky (and I use that term loosely, like ""winning the lottery 3 times in a row while being struck with lightning mid polar bear attack"" kind of odds) guesses of somewhat linkable txs, you've arrived at the full Anon set. It's barely an honest comparison because even if you could glean anything from it, it would be literally useless info until 35 years from now when quantum computing is cracking every encryption anyway.

From a mathematical point of view, zcash is definitely more encrypted, that much is certainly fact. But similarly, I could even assert that the Anon set is actually incredibly choked from zcash having such small shielded txs to begin with. And the transition from shielded to unshielded txs that exchanges require make deterministic links over a known fluid intermediary layer over time. That's the biggest threat to zcash is that privacy is completely optional; even ""sold"" as a premium, in a sense. Making the zcash Anon set <4% last I had to prove I wasn't talking out my ass to a zcash but that wasn't recent, so I apologise if that's changed significantly... With Monero, there isn't any point where txs are ""unshielded"" or linkable to any capacity. And really it's only now occoured how far I've swing off topic here... I don't think debating privacy coins was where we're supposed to end up here on /r/Bitcoin.

But what you're describing by saying  is not a further shade of fungibility, but a greater lack of leaked or linkable information. Which is great and more power to whichever is truly less doxxing, however in perfect theory and not facing extraneuous examination, I was basically saying that fungibility either exists or it doesn't.

"Right, so you are using the 2nd definition where inflation = rise in prices, that I mentioned 5 posts ago. Almost no one in cryptocurrency uses that definition. Here, inflation = increase in money supply, period. Rise in prices is the EFFECT, not the CAUSE.

Its retarded to talk about the rise in prices, because there is no way to know the true reason why prices rise. There could be many factors. Governments and Keynesian economists use price to measure inflation so that they can keep the citizens quiet, such as when the US reports low % CPI increases. Meanwhile they're printing money like crazy.

Austrian economists and people in cryptocurrency define inflation as the increase in money supply. So if money is printed, then that IS inflation. That's the definition. There is nothing to argue. Whether that results in increase in prices (aka the loss of purchasing power) remains to be seen. Certainly the increase in money supply is a large contributing factor in the loss of purchasing power, as more dollars chase the same amount of goods.

Bitcoin's money supply is capped at 21 million coins. There can never be any inflation past that. However, to accelerate adoption, Bitcoin uses inflation to incentivize people to run mining operations. Right now only 18 million of the coins have been issued, and the rest is distributed to miners for their service. This is inflation of the bitcoin money supply in its early stages. Eventually Bitcoin will no longer be inflationary, actually it will be deflationary, as the money supply CONTRACTS, because of user error as access to coins become forever lost (forgotten passwords, broken hardware, etc). We are talking about inflation and deflation with no mention of prices whatsoever. Solely using it to talk about the quantity of money in circulation.

"There aren't ""addresses"" in Lightning. There are node IDs and invoices. Anything can be put in a QR code, including a Lightning invoice.

Have you seen the Breez wallet's ""Connect To Pay"" feature? When the payer and the payee are both using Breez, then they don't need to communicate a Lightning invoice between them directly. One simply shares a short link to the other by whatever means they enjoy (text message, email, Messenger, QR code, etc.), and the link opens up the Breez app and brings both parties into a screen where they can arrange their Lightning payment. It's the ""friendliest"" way I've seen of conducting a Bitcoin payment, surpassing even on-chain Bitcoin wallets, though it does leak privacy like a sieve.";1;1;False;whitslack;ffmle1f;Just got my BTC & LN node set up!

"You'll be much more anxious if you don't report then get audited. It's pretty simple. 

Bitcoin is taxed as property, subject to Capital Gains. If you bought and then sold within a year, any earnings (money you made) is considered and taxed as regular income. If you bought and then sold after holding for more than a year, it's taxed at the capital gains rate you fall into depending on your bracket. You can write off loses against your gains as well, if you sold less than you bought. 

Just use Turbotax and it will calculate everything for you. It's very easy.

Edit: If you are just holding, you don't have to report anything.";1;0;False;sreaka;ffjgy86;Unintentional BTC Purchase;eswl70;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/eswl70/unintentional_btc_purchase/

I don’t understand the question.  If you’re asking what kind of wallet should you use.  I personally like the Trezor and the Nano.  I’ve used electrum and pepper wallets.

I believe it’s because if you use a USB to save your keys you run the risk of hackers stealing your keys.  My understanding is that Hardware wallets are basically Air gapped from various forms of hacks.  I have to really touch up on my wallet knowledge, it’s been a few years since I did any research into these matters.;1;1;False;Zombie4141;ffjbnv6;Just wondering;esqzg6;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/esqzg6/just_wondering/
