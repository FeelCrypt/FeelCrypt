"Did the bot give you a Pm? If not, look at it's comment on this thread. Click on withdraw button, request the sats, and it'll PM you an invoice. Give your wallet that invoice, then it's yours!

The problem in the housing crisis wasn't the people flipping houses.  They usually ended up being the victims.  It was the big banks and credit rating agencies that were reporting false values to keep the loan money flowing.
