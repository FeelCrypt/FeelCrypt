"The fed is already audited by an outside group (loads of other people describe this in the thread). This makes sure there’s transparency and competency.

If congress is auditing the Fed, it lets them portray the fed in a certain light, take statements out of context, etc. This incentivizes the Fed to pursue expansionary monetary policy (“more jobs”) around election times because it’s easier for members of Congress to be reelected in a good economy.

I would also say the Founders opinions on central banks should be taken lightly as modern economics was in its infancy when they were around. Macroeconomics has changed a lot since then. It was only relatively recently that the US moved from gold-backed currency to fiat currency.

">you wouldn't do TARP

TARP did great things in preventing the nigh-total collapse of the financial sector and every single loan it issued made a profit for the US Treasury. The moral hazards of too-big-to-fail are extant, but have largely been addressed since the crisis, and a second Great Depression would have been pretty shitty for everyone.

>ZIRP

There is an incredible body of empirical data providing nigh-irrefutable support for the concept of expansionary monetary policy. Targeting a near-zero Federal Funds Rate is a natural and logical progression for the Fed(and, under different names, any other central bank) to undertake when lowered, but still higher than near-zero, rates are insufficient. Lowering rates accelerates inflation, but A. that is a good thing when there are deflationary risks and B. inflation has been very low regardless, though it has been increasing a bit recently(and the Fed has been raising rates alongside, as it should.)

>QE

See ZIRP. QE and such unorthodox tactics are necessary when a ZIRP is insufficient to effectively jump-start economic growth and recovery. 

>QE directly to the people

Literally impossible. Individuals do not have reserve accounts at the Fed and they are also don't really have a bunch of T-bills to give as compensation. Contrary to what many think, QE is not printing money. (Not to discredit Helicopter Money as a concept, but it's best reserved for when the situation is far worse and there is evident deflation.)

>bail out homeowners directly

Not at all in the power of the Federal Reserve, and bailing out homeowners would have been bailing out financial institutions anyway, given that that's where the money would have gone anyway. Moreover, the federal government did take significant actions to aid homeowners unfairly disaffected by the crisis. (Of course, as far as moral hazard goes, many were very much culpable as far as moral hazard is concerned.)

Additionally, static money isn't making more money.

Banks are tied together in massive chains and loops of interconnected debt that allow them to both profitably represent the full balance of find they ""possess"" while they still have available a fraction to perform their ""primary"" function of making your money available to you.

I disagree that QE isn't ""printing money"" (literally the first line of wikipedia: ""Quantitative easing (QE) is a monetary policy in which a central bank creates new electronic money in order to buy government bonds or other financial assets to stimulate the economy""). If it wasn't unfairly influencing the economy, they wouldn't do it.

"The current audit is not a full audit and leaves congress in the dark on aspects of the federal reserve and how they operate.  As a result they cannot make decisions based on all of the information because it is excluded from them.  The lack of transparency creates a flawed system where corrupt people can make decisions without accountability. 
  
All of the arguments against a full audit are based on fear mongering and not scientific proof like they should be.  This is why you will see people say that a full audit would give congress too much control as a fear mongering tactic when it doesn't actually give them any more control than they do now.  It would just make them more informed and empower congress to make better decisions.

">that they steal from the future

How? Through inflation? Whatever inflation the 2008-onward ZIRP and QEs 1 through 3 caused was very minimal and very desirable, given the deflationary threats we faced.

>deployed supply side

So? 

>since it's wages that are the current deficiency in the economy.

No, it's [productivity growth](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/OPHNFB), among others, and that's a structural problem that cannot be resolved through monetary policy. Low real compensation growth(wages aren't the only form of compensation for labor) is a symptom of several structural problems, low productivity growth being a major one. 

Moreover, ""demand side inflationary measures"", whatever they may be, wouldn't do anything to fix low wage growth. Short-run fiscal stimulus can help fight recessions and drive demand(in theory, but... well, maybe? It depends on several factors.), but they will not cause long-run increases in real wages. Significant welfare expansion could maybe help people if paid for, but it, too, wouldn't increase wages paid by employers. And, most relevantly to the topic, isn't something that can be done by a central bank. 

>Why not offer ZIRP to home owners / student debtors?

Because the Federal Reserve, and the US government in general, is not a commercial bank. And, of course, *a ZIRP isn't actually the Federal Reserve lending to banks at near-zero*. A ZIRP is a central bank engaging in open market security purchases with the intent of lowering the rate at which banks lend to each other overnight to near-zero(the Federal Funds Rate), not lending money at zero percent interest. The Federal Reserves *DOES* lend to banks directly, but that's a different mechanism, the Discount Window, which A. is always set above the market rate, B. hit 0.5% at its very lowest during the height of the recession(it was 1.75-2.25% in June, fwiw, while the Fed Funds rate was ~1.00%.), and C. is loathed to be used by Banks, because it's stigmatized and expensive.

>And how is QE to the people impossible? Simply give everyone an extra one-time tax refund.

Do you know what QE is? It's the Federal Reserve taking treasury securities from banks and crediting the reserve accounts held by said banks at the Federal Reserve; it does not affect the size of the banks' balance sheet and does not involve printing money. 

The federal government just writing people a check may or may not be an effective fiscal response to recession, but it's not monetary policy, and cannot be done by a central bank. Also, as a side note, for your earlier talk of ""stealing from the future"", as deficit spending requires the government to take out debt that it will have to pay back in the future. Not against it whatsoever, but barring just printing money(which I would think bitcoin folk don't like), it has a nominal cost. (Even printing money has a very real cost in inflation, which is why helicopter money is really only suitable as a dramatic method of fighting deflation.)

Also, the federal government just writing people checks is basically what the stimulus package was. It worked well enough to mitigate for the drop in state and local governmental expenditure. It was done alongside the Fed's expansionary monetary policy. (The Federal Reserve refusing to engage in expansionary monetary policy and allowing the money supply to contract and banks to fail was the driving cause behind the Great Depression.)

>The big difference here is that those people would no longer be saddled with debt/rents, and so they'd be able to exercise demand in the economy. When assets get inflated via QE it does nothing for the demand side.

It would also cost a bunch of money, result in a huge crowding-out effect, is really not guaranteed to revive the bullish animal spirits as the large majority of consumers were not disaffected poor-ish homeowners with subprime mortgages who nonetheless had varying levels of culpability for their own problems. Of course, the government actually did work to make many of the mortgages much more affordable through various means and programs.

The people who borrow money indeed get to spend it, but they also accrue interest on those loans and they're sure as shit not at 1.25 or 1.75. ""Poor"" people meanwhile experience wage growth at a rate that exceeds inflation due to the increase in output (google it if you don't believe me; it's demonstrable that nominal wage growth has outpaced inflation). If you remove inflation you can kiss a significant portion of that nominal wage growth goodbye. If you remove inflation you incentivize hoarding of cash instead of spending it as inflation results in a natural redistribution of wealth (eg wealth loses value, real cost of debt is reduced).

I would like an example of a discussion detail that could come out at a fed meeting that should be kept from the public for 10 years lest it cause the markets to spin out of control.

Earlier in this thread you gave an example of how, had the fed revealed which banks it was offering bailouts to publicly, those banks would have refused the money as it would have panicked investors.  I can see that as an argument for secrecy on the order of one year.

I can't see it as justifying a 10 year hold.  And I am having troube imagining one that would.

If your only argument is to point out just how many higher degrees the fed officers collectively hold, so gosh they must know what they are doing, then I have to ask for a little more justification than that.

">What's your opinion on the actions of Banks in the lead up to the 2008 crisis?

Well, what do you mean by ""Banks""? ""Banks"" are not some monolithic entity; they are competing firms with individual goals and motivations. Moreover, there are several types of banks; commercial and investment, as well as the shadow banking system. Trying to cast judgement on the whole industry is very unfair; most of the fuckhuge commercial banks weren't actually significantly involved in the subprime crash and even took on the risk of acquiring several of the almost-dead investment banks to help stabilize the system. (Bear Stearns was acquired by JP Morgan Chase, Merrill Lynch by Bank of America, for example.)

Now, if I can accurately estimate your actual question

Subprime mortgages are not themselves a bad thing, hence the reason they're still very much allowed today; you wouldn't want anyone with a lacking credit rating to be denied the possibility of getting a mortgage, right? The problems emerge from the housing value bubble; the constantly rising house prices meant that subprime borrowers could reasonably expect to be able to refinance their mortgage a couple of years after making it as the value of their property rose(resulting in a bit of a vicious cycle where values rose because of this causing values to rise even more and so forth), and from the perverse incentives created by an under-regulation of the MBS system. 

Mortgage-backed securities are not a bad idea either. Mortgages are generally very reliable and profitable, and international demand for American MBS was huge because of too-good-to-be-true ratios of risk:return. But, they created a setup that propagated the problems of subprime mortgages by motivating mortgage originators to not have to adequately consider the risks of the mortgages they issued. This is because they could and did immediately sell their mortgages to securitizers; new regulations make it so that originators, if they are going to sell their mortgages, have to keep skin in the game, something they did not have to do before the market crash. It's hard to blame any individual entity for doing what made sense to it in this case; the blame goes towards the system at large and towards the regulators that failed to have and act upon sufficient foresight. 

Now, the conflict-of-interests involved in the credit-rating agencies being paid by the securitizers to rate the MBS rather than by the security purchasers were very unethical, albeit not quite illegal. As much as the credit-rating agencies should have been more ethically conscious(same for the securitizers), you really have to give a leering glance towards the purchasers for failing to be diligent and think critically. *Caveat emptor*.

Then, you get to the investment banks that went under or would have if not for the Government/JPMorgan/BoA; Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, and Bear Stearns. Quite frankly, they were stupid, took stupid risks, and over leveraged themselves to do so. I'm won't go so far as to say that they had a fiduciary duty to society not to do so, but their management certainly had one to their shareholders and customers. It was nothing criminal, but nonetheless somewhat pathetic. Of course, they weren't operating with necessarily good information and hindsight is 20-20, but still. I'm not going to condemn what some people call ""greed"", but I will the condemn stupid recklessness of failing to consider worst-case scenarios, of failing to exercise proper cynicism, and of failing to be more responsible, more thoughtful, and more intelligent. 

AIG? Not a bank, and I don't put a huge amount of blame on them, if just because they were well down the causal line. The MBS crash and the subsequent money market runs aren't its fault, and it isn't unreasonable to say that its derivative positions(security insurance, really), when propped up by the Government bailout, were probably helpful in mitigating the damages in much the reverse manner of what would have happened had it failed to, independently or not, compensate investors when their investments went bad. 

The fundamental failing of the financial industry was, in essence, not having foresight and not holding onto enough reserve capital to allow itself to weather the storm of a crisis. (Again, not all; many were adequately capitalized and/or not overly involved in the MBS market.)

And you can't blame the wide scope of investors for running on the money market. That would be unfair. If not for the FDIC guaranteeing my deposits, you can be real fucking sure I'd be breaking traffic laws left and right to get to empty my accounts if I thought my bank was going to go under, as would any rational person. I know that me doing so would contribute to a economic collapse, but damn I'm getting mine.

>This isn't a loaded question I have just never really met anybody that defends quantitative easing since the only people who are receiving money from QE are the people that caused the financial crisis so I'm a little interested on your perspective about what happened prior to and leading up to the financial crisis.

QE is not a handout of money. It's the Fed crediting the bank reserves(deposit accounts for banks, basically) it holds in exchange for longer-term financial assets like MBS and Treasuries. It does not affect the totals on a bank's balance sheet(the Assets value of the accounting equation(A=L+SE) does not change). I really want to get this established. 

>And also why, even if it is the most financially prudent method of fixing things, have we not charged any of the people who caused this initial collapse?

Because nobody committed an actual crime. Unethical, stupid, and overly risky business practices are not necessarily criminal; if they were, Tim Cook would be in prison for the ""dongle"". Moreover, it would be incredible difficult to find any actual individuals to charge if there were some criminal law already on the books, and any good lawyer could get a jury to acquit. 

Now, with that said, moral hazard is nonetheless a huge deal in regards to too-big-to-fail. If firms think that they can afford to take unnecessary and dangerous risks because they'll just be saved by the government if something goes really wrong, then they damn well will and we would probably get a clone of the FC. That's why the post-crisis regulations require big financial institutions to have living wills to enable them to be dismantled safely should they fail, rather than require and be guaranteed a substantial bailout. (I'm not a huge fan of this approach; I'm skeptical of how well it can work, especially in a timely manner. I'd prefer a law setting forth a protocol for a failing too-big-to-fail institution to, upon the consensus of the Fed chair, the Treasury Sec, and the head of the FDIC, be fully nationalized, then capitalized, and then fully privatized once the risks have been nullified, for potentially zero compensation should the situation/moral hazards/stupidity be extreme enough to warrant.)

"I don't blame it on the Fed. I accept responsibility that this is happening in the first place. We (individually and as a society) have a choice of whether to have a single point of failure or not. Allowing the Fed to exist in the manner that it does allows a lot of power to be highly consolidated. This becomes political no matter what. 

I appreciate the sentiment for basic income, but I think that also creates artificial consumption that would not otherwise happens, which ""steals"" from those that don't use or need it.

>Effective Congressional oversight of the Fed is essential, of course, but it involves some complex tradeoffs.  On the one hand, Congress has the ultimate responsibility of assuring itself and the public that monetary policy is being conducted reasonably and in the national interest.  On the other hand, institutionally, Congress is not well-suited to make monetary policy decisions itself, because of the technical and time-sensitive nature of those decisions.  Moreover, both historical experience and formal studies (for example, here, here, and here) have shown that monetary policy achieves better results when central bankers are allowed to focus on the longer-term interests of the economy, free of short-term political considerations.  

>Following international best practice, Congress has for many years effectively managed these tradeoffs by setting goals for monetary policy—specifically, that policy be set to foster “maximum employment” and “stable prices”—and holding the Fed accountable for reaching them.  Consistent with the principle of accountability, the Fed is allowed to determine the settings of policy without political interference (this is what is meant by “central bank independence”).  In turn, the Fed must regularly report and explain its decisions to Congress and the public, and in particular it must demonstrate that it is meeting its Congressional mandate.  In practice, the Fed’s public communications about policy take many forms.  For example, in speeches and other public appearances, Fed policymakers lay out in detail the considerations affecting current and future policy moves, including arguments on both sides of the issue.  The Fed chair faces reporters in four press conferences each year and testifies before a variety of Congressional committees, including two rounds explicitly focused on monetary policy.  Public Congressional testimonies are supplemented by dozens of meetings and calls each year between the chair and members of Congress, as well as frequent contacts between Fed and Congressional staff members.

"You have a misunderstanding of the system. The banks don't actually print more money. They accept deposits and then loan that currency as mortgages or what not. Then those people deposit some of the money from the loans, and we repeat the process with the subsequent deposits being smaller and smaller.

There is no actual money in your bank account. That is just a simple way of expressing it. In reality, you are giving your bank a loan with the stipulation that you can withdraw your money at any point. The banks keep enough reserve cash to cover any realistic amount of withdrawals and borrow money at very low interest from other banks if their reserves are too low at the end of the day.

You could do the same thing yourself. That is essentially what local banks are. You just need to have a lot of starting capital (around a few million dollars) to maintain your reserves before you have many clients or have received FDIC backing, but there is no actual laws stopping you from doing the same things as them.

You can blast me with Keynesianism academics all day, the fact is that it created the biggest financial crisis since 1929. I understand the motives behind ZIRP and QE, and I understand how they encourage spending. The problem with them is that they steal from the future and are deployed supply side, which is why I say ""pushing on a rope."" We need these inflationary measures deployed on the demand side, since it's wages that are the current deficiency in the economy. Why not offer ZIRP to home owners / student debtors? And how is QE to the people impossible? Simply give everyone an extra one-time tax refund.

>bailing out homeowners would have been bailing out financial institutions anyway, given that that's where the money would have gone anyway

The big difference here is that those people would no longer be saddled with debt/rents, and so they'd be able to exercise demand in the economy.

"Check out [this graph](http://www.rba.gov.au/speeches/1994/images/sp-gov-231194-graph1.gif) comparing an index of central bank independence to average inflation rate. One might notice that there appears to be a strong correlation that increased central bank independence causes decreased inflation. This study was from 1991, and its statistics go back to the 60s, but I assure you that central banks understand macroeconomics better than ever nowadays especially after 2008. 

Audit the Fed is a bullshit title like many Congressional bills.[ The Fed is already independently audited](https://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/about_12784.htm) by the Government Accountability Office, and the Officer of Inspector General, and annually by an independent non-government auditor. The Fed's balance sheets are published weekly and[ top-level meeting transcripts](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc_historical.htm) are always released after a few months.

So, you might be wondering, what is Audit the Fed then? Again, it's bullshit. The ""Audit the Fed"" bill passed around Congress is actually about *congressional* control of the Federal Reserve, which would completely destroy any notion of the Federal Reserve being a governmental yet independent institution. 

But why would so many Redditors support Audit the Fed if it's bullshit? Well, a lot of people don't like the Federal Reserve anyways, honestly because they don't understand it. They think it's just a way to prop up the big banks (it isn't, it has two goals and two goals only: decrease unemployment, and stabilize consumer prices. These two things definitely help the little guy, because it's not the big bankers being unemployed when unemployment hits double digits. This is called the ""[dual mandate](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/100715/breaking-down-federal-reserves-dual-mandate.asp)""). They might be in favor of a gold standard (which, by all means, is not viable in a modern economy), something that would prevent the Fed from doings its job, so they subconsciously to do anything to spite it. The Gold Standard people, like Ron Paul, support auditing the Fed because they don't really care about the balance sheets. They care about control and precedent. They are trying to pass a bill that would give them the legal precedent to control the Federal Reserve through Congress so they can one day dismantle them. The other crowd, the Bernie people, aren't nearly as strong on audit the fed. But they have the mislead idea that banks are evil, banks should be audited because they do shady things, the Fed is a bank, therefore the Fed should be audited. But the Fed is *not* a bank.

The Fed is a good institution. There's nothing shady going on--it's a *central* bank. There's no profit motives, or political pressures. Their independence allows them to have one motivation and one alone: the dual mandate. Reduce unemployment, stabilize prices. It's a fantastic institution staffed by some of the smartest people in the country with a goal purer than politics, so it needs to be completely separate from it.

"Physical backing simply limits the max-amount of currency.

Bitcoin is limited-issue as guaranteed by the math and protocol behind it.

Both are two ways of achieving the same thing, creating a limited issue.

There is no problem with bitcoin not having physical backing and still serving as currency just fine. People who think this way tend to have a psychological bias against non-material objects have value, but that is a 20th century way of thinking and we live in the 21st, where digital objects have value all over the place.

Bitcoin is the first digital object that cannot simply be copied infinitely due to the shared ledger property of cryptocurrency, and thus can be used as money.";2;0;False;Anen-o-me;dk6a8ey;Guy just did this on live tv;6mut9d;https://i.redd.it/nsokakmrn69z.jpg

Bitcoin gives power to the people while the Federal Reserve takes power from the people by inflating your money and reducing its spending power over time.  The person speaking is the Chairman of the federal reserve who was testifying in front of a congressional committee and this was on national TV.  On top of that, the sign was held up while she was dodging a question about why she didn't want to be audited so the timing was perfect.;6;1;False;somecrypto;dk5475m;Guy just did this on live tv;6mut9d;https://i.redd.it/nsokakmrn69z.jpg

"Don't have a strong opinion wither way, but the reasons to not audit the Fed are pretty obvious. The Fed should clearly not be under government control, and is designed that way. The Fed's books are currently audited by Deloitte, and this movement is specifically so that the GAO (govt office) can assess the Fed's policy decisions.

This strikes fear in many people who want the Fed to be independent, that the GAO can politicize monetary policy, and opens the door to political pressure on future policy. 

Imagine a president pressuring them to lower rates so they can get reelected, not good. Whether or not there already is political pressure is up for debate, but that this would increase the amount is indisputable.";1;2;False;askmaury;dk56ev9;Guy just did this on live tv;6mut9d;https://i.redd.it/nsokakmrn69z.jpg

"Copied and pasted from something i judt posted. But good to see for anyone wanting to understand the situation

Don't have a strong opinion wither way, but the reasons to not audit the Fed are pretty obvious. The Fed should clearly not be under government control, and is designed that way. The Fed's books are currently audited by Deloitte, and this movement is specifically so that the GAO (govt office) can assess the Fed's policy decisions.

This strikes fear in many people who want the Fed to be independent, that the GAO can politicize monetary policy, and opens the door to political pressure on future policy. 

Imagine a president pressuring them to lower rates so they can get reelected, not good. Whether or not there already is political pressure is up for debate, but that this would increase the amount is indisputable.

"To answer this we have to discuss how money works. The simplest explanation I have is that when you trade labour for something you want that thing to be as scarce as possible. In other words the ""money"" or ""store of value"" should not be easily produced or faked by someone else in the world, which would essentially just make you work your ass off for something that they can easily just make out of thin air. When we look at a currency like USD it is basically just computer databases that can be edited by those in control, or printed by criminals/those in control. In both those cases you are losing out because your money you hold is getting watered down in value, because its not as scarce as it was when you earned it. 

Now, when you look at bitcoin as an alternative you must understand how it makes this new kind of money that is more scarce, more difficult to fake/produce and not as easily watered down. Essentially it makes it more reliable as a store of value so that you can trade your past labor for future labor from someone else. 

Another way to look at it is because bitcoin has a limited amount, and more people could move to using it it means theres less bitcoin available per person on average. That means demand for it increases while supply stays the same, that means the amount of purchasing power must increase. 

Yet another way to look at it is like a record keeping system for crowd lending. If you buy bitcoin, your dollar goes to someone else who used to have bitcoin but wanted or had to sell for some reason. That must be quite a good reason otherwise they wouldnt sell. That means they must have something that they want to have happen in the world that is worthwhile to happen, it could be because they want to buy something they need (which could make them more productive, or have a better life, like a bicycle or car, or a home and so on), that money then goes to someone who produced something that was worthwhile to do. That person then most likely uses that money to buy supplies to make more of whatever they make that is useful. Essentially your dollar moves around in the economy probably doing good, good that otherwise would have not been possible without your dollar. Doing better than it would have if you held it in your pocket, or put it in the bank where the banker used it to buy some snort or wheels for his ferrari. So in comparison it probably produces more good in the world because bitcoin is scarce and people want it, so when people sell bitcoin it is more likely to go to a good purpose. In the long run this value produced in the world reflects back on the purchasing price of bitcoin because of market dynamics.. thus when you want to sell bitcoin you'll probably be able to buy more dollars then you put in at the start. 

just note that currency market are complex, it could be that something even better comes along. The FED might stop printing money, and burn all the paper money they can get their hands on, so that might make the dollar more scarce again.. anything is possible.";6;1;False;rende;dk5mfuz;Guy just did this on live tv;6mut9d;https://i.redd.it/nsokakmrn69z.jpg
"Apart from being a store of value (like gold) that you can actually transact with, another important aspect is that you are in control of your own money. When your money is in a bank it can be taken from you/frozen at any time.

I understand that deflationary currency sucks for an economy focused at growth at all costs, but it's great for an individual focused on saving at all costs.

Yes maybe that's worse for the economy, but you're not talking to the economy, you're talking to an individual, and I play this game for myself, not for the game.
