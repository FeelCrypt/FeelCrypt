"It is a shillcoin. The people pushing for it are trying to trick people into thinking it's the main Bitcoin, and using incredibly shady PR tactics to do it. it doesn't solve the scaling problem, just postpones it while making it require better computers to mine and run a node, which further centralizes the system, that thing you claim not to want.

Still, it’s strange. It was at 16k around Boxing Day as well and dipped to 13-14 until now. Just strange that people are so sure of its turnaround when it literally dipped from 20k to 13 a month ago.

Yeah, but it was like this like 20 days ago too. Dropped from 20k to 13k around the 22nd, rose to 16k around Boxing Day and then dropped to 13k again before getting to what it is now.

"**Dot-com bubble**

The dot-com bubble (also known as the dot-com boom, the dot-com crash, the Y2K crash, the Y2K bubble, the tech bubble, the Internet bubble, the dot-com collapse, and the information technology bubble) was a historic economic bubble and period of excessive speculation that occurred roughly from 1997 to 2001, a period of extreme growth in the usage and adaptation of the Internet by businesses and consumers. During this period, many Internet-based companies, commonly referred to as dot-coms, were founded, many of which failed.

During 2000–2002, the bubble collapsed. Some companies, such as Pets.com and Webvan, failed completely and shut down.

"Every transaction you make is absolutely the wrong one, on a short timeline (you'll never hit the perfect short term top or bottom). But its not like the spin of a roulette wheel or hand of blackjack, you still hold coins, they just rise and fall where you don't want them.

Can make 10-20% easy, in a couple hours, sometimes less, sometimes more, if you pay decent attention and have reasonable goals.

"I'm a btc supporter personally, but this is all kinds of dumb.

""Making it require better computers to mine and run a node...""
You haven't been able to mine btc on a cpu for years. BCH hasn't changed that. 
I assume when you say better you mean HD space. I think IF they had full blocks it would require like 400GB a year. But, they don't even have close to full blocks, and if they did that means the adaption/use rate is at least 8 times more than it is now.

""...despite the theoretical  possible need to have service providers...""
LN will only be useful if you setup a channel with one party where you transact many times. Opening a channel for one transaction would incur two fees making it meaningless. 
LN requires you to lock funds into the channel. Only a large hub can afford to lock funds into many channels. How many channels can you afford to lock funds in? Finally, no one says it's not ""cryptographically secure"". The argument I see made most is that it allows the hub used to route transactions to censor them i.e. funds to a certain user/address can be blocked by the hub

You can call bch'ers shills. But you really need to acknowledge that there are valid criticisms to be made about LN.";2;1;False;microgoatz;dsay2ns;Everyone who's trading BTC right now;7olruz;http://cdn.mutually.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/08-19.jpg

"This is what we know:

> The incentive can also be funded with transaction fees. If the output value of a transaction is
less than its input value, the difference is a transaction fee that is added to the incentive value of
the block containing the transaction. Once a predetermined number of coins have entered
circulation, the incentive can transition entirely to transaction fees and be completely inflation
free.

No one knows anything further than that. If they say they do, they are lying.

What does it mean? Well, you'll have to think for yourself and decide.

I'm not sure quite how the trade fees are determined, but I wouldn't be surprised if it was simply priority. You and Bob both want to send a transaction. Bob is willing to pay $0.50 more. You get booted; better luck next block (which happens every 10 minutes by design).

This system implies that there will be fewer and fewer lotteries to win, since there are a predetermined number of coins. That means the entire system will transition to trade fees.

Meaning we will eventually see a period where miners abandon bitcoin en masse, as they realize no one is willing to pay a trade fee that matches the current value of the coin. (The trade fee would have to be as least as much as the current lottery, since the current lottery is what justifies throwing so much computing power into it.)

This is the fate of Bitcoin. It cannot be argued, though many will try.

If Satoshi were still alive, he'd probably be stepping in right about now saying ""Wait! I only put the cap on to increase adoption and give a healthy network with lots of mining power. We still have an endgame to think about. We need to remove the cap on BTC and make it a consistent 5% inflation per year.""

But people think Satoshi would have said a lot of things. Either way, this is his legacy the world idolizes.";1;1;False;palish;dsb7bk8;Everyone who's trading BTC right now;7olruz;http://cdn.mutually.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/08-19.jpg

"In addition to what others have said, there are a few other theoretical ideas behind why it has value:

* It was designed from day one to be a trustless currency and store of value separate from any central control, meaning no government or bank has the ability to print more money (there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins created) or prevent you from sending money anywhere, etc.

* It is pseudonymous -- it is very difficult to trace a particular account back to a particular person. It *is* possible to trace transactions in certain circumstances, especially when using external aggregate info (like the IRS demanding info from Coinbase) but in general it is pretty private.

* It is extremely secure and well-designed. The original designer solved two of the toughest problems in computer science history to invent it, and it has been upgraded over the years by some of the best cryptographers on the planet.

* It is very censorship-resistant and attack-resistant. Look up the term ""anti-fragile"" -- basically every time it is attacked (hundreds of times now) it just gets stronger. This makes people trust it more.

* It takes an *extreme* amount of electricity to mine it. The mining network is effectively orders of magnitude stronger than the fastest supercomputer -- it was [four exahashes per second in 2016](https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-hashrate-four-exahash-per-second/) and ""the growth of mining pools has led many people to believe bitcoin is the most secure computational network in history.""

"In addition to having value because people will buy it, it has value because it has utility - Bitcoin is a different way to think about money.

* You can send Bitcoin to anyone with internet access without worrying about banks or borders in less time than the legacy banking system.

* You can store money with Bitcoin without worrying about physically storing or protecting gold or physical bills - you can even memorize a series of words so that your bitcoins can only be accessed by you, and you can do so anywhere in the world with an internet connection.

>Thats what people meant when they say yeah they can work harder to get that promotion only to move up in the tax bracket to be rewarded with a bigger portions of your earning being taken

This is an incredibly common misconception. When you move up a tax bracket you're taxed more *only on the money that is above the previous bracket*. So if you make just below a 40k tax cutoff and are taxed at 20%, if you get bumped to 50k and are now paying 30%, you're only paying 30% taxes on the 10K above the cutoff. You're still taxed at 20% on the 40k. So you're taxed more, but in no way do you make less money... you are always earning money.

"Let me explain the logic to you then.

It's like you betting on a coinflip with me for 10 dollars.  But you only get 5 dollars if you win.  The other 5 gets taxed.

So you stand to lose 10 but at best only win half because of tax.  Is that still a bet you're willing to go through?  Better think twice.


Now if you rigged the coin and you know you'll win no matter what, then of course it doesn't matter what tax there is as long as it's not 100% you'll go all in.  But can you really say that about crypto?

You're risking every dollar you put into it.  Nobody reimburse you when your investment fails.  But on the off chance your hard work do suceed.  Now they come in and you don't get to keep 100% of your wins either.

Thats what people meant when they say yeah they can work harder to get that promotion only to move up in the tax bracket to be rewarded with a bigger portions of your earning being taken.

"Correct. That is a non-fungible blockchain commodity. That is not a crypto currency. 

You understand what fungible means right? My only point, was that if a currency was not fungible, that by definition makes it centralized. 

So of course, with cryptocurrencies being decentralized, they HAVE to be fungible. With fungibility being the only definition of commodities, any decentralized currency, crypto or not, is a commodity. There is an overlap there. 

You correctly pointed out they are by definition commodities, my point is that it is soley because of decentralization. 

The only other currency that has ever been also directly considered a commodity, were precious metals which have other utility. Some places (like google) define commodity as:

That ""Woulda had $200k"" came from an $11k buy-in, back at the $1,150 peak bubble. (Yeah I bought in right at the top of a bubble, like an idiot. If I had waited a couple months then it ""woulda been $400k."")

That's reasonable. I think people do this calculation all the time. There are opportunities for extra money in many cases but people value their own time over working extra if they don't need it. Moving into a higher marginal tax bracket might change the calculus a bit too. However, you would have to be on the edge of a tax bracket for it to matter. Even then the rate of tax increases modestly between brackets so in the worst case scenario it changes the calculus marginally. In the largest tax bracket change you earn ~88% of what you earn in the lower tax bracket. Every other bracket change still results in better than ~93%.;1;0;False;PatSays;dsbmkl6;Everyone who's trading BTC right now;7olruz;http://cdn.mutually.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/08-19.jpg

"It's actually deeper and much cooler than that: the fee goes to the miners.

Who are the miners? They're the ones powering the system.

How do they power it? It's a worldwide distributed random lottery. The more computing resources you pour into it, the higher the shot of hitting the 15BTC jackpot per block. You know how it's a blockchain? That's because when someone hits the jackpot, another block gets added to the chain.

You can read about it in detail here: https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf but don't worry if most of it seems opaque. Lots of smart people pored over this and found few flaws. Satoshi had to drag us kicking and screaming here.

Anyway, the fees go to the miners because each block can only hold a certain number of transactions. That limit was reached. Meaning those who pay more, get to be in the next block. So you can choose to pay $0.05 instead, but your tx will never get incorporated into a block because everyone else is paying more.

Why not make the blocks bigger? That is a divisive topic in these circles, but two reasons:

1. Bitcoin wasn't designed to be a currency. It's a store of wealth. (Ignore the ""cash"" aspect of the paper and pay attention to everything else. The current situation is outlined in 6.2, trade fees.) For lightweight transactions, use other cryptos.

2. Raising the block size would be bad news for BTC long term. You have to store the entire blockchain to participate. It's already gigabytes. If you 2x the block size, that will grow it 2x as quickly. And then we'll hit the limit anyway and be right back in the same damn situation.

BTC was designed to operate this way, and it's still going strong. And it will succeed if people just *don't change it* and let it be rock solid. Satoshi planned for this.

"My point is never about making less overall.

That'd be like saying once you reach a threshold you get 100% of your income taxed, so you take home $0.  But before you reach that you only get taxed 99%.  That would have been a ridiculous system.

I'm talking about calculating the trade off between your ""life force/time"" vs the money you make minus the amount that will get taxed on a progressive manner.

Imagine your job is hurling 20 tons of brick every day for 1X amount of money, and in order for you to make more money, your boss agreed to pay you 2X if you move 40 tons a day.  That's fair right?  Yet for twice the amount of bricks you have to put on your back, you will still only be able to take home 1.85X due to tax.  Sure it's still more than 1X, you're ""better off"" with that extra money that you can spend on stuff you enjoy.

But keep in mind you exchanged for it with twice the work/strain on your body/limited amount of time in your life.  But hey if that's worth it for you (sometimes it's out of necessity) then you won't see me fighting you over what you want to do with your life/time.  

But of course in my example, it could very well be that your equivalent job only have to move 21 tons a day and make 1.75X money.  Depends on the job/promotion so people can make their own calculation whether it's worth it or not.

First the limit is 21 million. Second mining is the solving of a mathmaticaly hard problem to verify a block, a block is a group of transactions linked to the previous block for a block to be accepted the miners must find a number which when put into a function with the block it gives a value below the current difficulty* because this problem is hard miners pick random numbers and check if it makes the block valid if it does they broadcast the new valid block to the network, in return they get a reward, new bitcoins. Third the limit is enforced by the colective if a miner trys to gI've himself more bitcoins all the nodes notice that, the reward value is wrong and they drop the block and the miner has wasted time and money to try that so he lost money so he won't do that in the first place.;5;0;False;Alonzo-Coeus;dsbe5zx;Everyone who's trading BTC right now;7olruz;http://cdn.mutually.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/08-19.jpg
"* The 21 million limit is imposed by the software. The software only recognizes transactions that follow specified rules. If anyone modifies the software to violate the rules their transactions will be ignored. The core devs could make the change but then the rest of the network would probably just fork the code, roll back the change, and essentially ignore the devs from that point on and replace them. Nobody really wants the number to go up.

* Mining is the process of solving a *very very hard* cryptographic puzzle (randomly generating hashes until one with a specified number of leading zeros is generated) for the purpose of securing transactions. Miners are the systems that validate transactions, so when you submit a transaction to the network the miners put it into the next block that will be added to the blockchain. When they solve the puzzle they get the rights to ""seal"" the block and broadcast it out to the rest of the network. All user nodes receive the new block containing all the new valid transactions (maybe 1000 tx per block) and they add it to their copy of the blockchain. The way the system is written, user nodes will reject any block that isn't properly signed by a mining node that won the cryptographic race. This puzzle is what allows the entire network to agree on a single copy of the ledger.

"Intrinsic value is a pretty dated concept in economic theory. The problem is that value is never universal (maybe you think apples have intrinsic value, but if I'm allergic to apples I wouldn't pay you even 1 cent per kilo (other than to sell them to someone else who values them more)), and if you try to make it universal you'll end up at nonsense like ""how much labour does it take to produce"", which doesn't work on many levels.

Subjective value, on the other hand, actually works great as the foundation for better economic models based on people's individual behaviour. And it doesn't have trouble explaining the valuation of non-physical things like Bitcoin, because plenty of people are obviously stoked for it.

The difference between OT and digital currency is you earn OT.  Capital gains will be taxed HEAVY because its investing - not labor.  Also, when you transfer in and out of the non-alt coin's you will be taxed on the gains of all outside trades & and the gains off the BTC (example).  So by the end of it, you will have already likely spent the money, or have it held up in some other crypto, which you will then need to withdraw - take another tax on - and continue the viscous cycle.

Someone, please help I really have no clue whats going on and how this whole thing works. Call me stupid and dumb for putting in all that money I know I screwed up. But please just help me figure out whats going on. Anyone have experience with this website before?!

I like all the salty people coming here asking dumb questions about bubbles and value and what can bitcoin do that money cant, blah blah blah. PSA: Do you really think we are going to spend time convincing a total stranger of the value of this new technology and its use cases when you are too lazy to do any basic research yourself so that you can reap the rewards later the same as those who put in the time to understand this? This goes for everyone who posts like this on here or comes from r/all looking to defend what they gullibly get fed on mainstream media. ;-1;0;False;southofearth;dsbb1yc;Everyone who's trading BTC right now;7olruz;http://cdn.mutually.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/08-19.jpg

"Copied from the Internet:""•	You are not really investing, you are mostly gambling. Some of these companies will likely fail to deliver a product. Maybe they never even intended to produce one.
•	Do not rush.
•	Don't be greedy.
•	Do not ask: ""What is the best ICO at the moment"". Or do it if you want to create a potential non-investment list. Do your homework first.
•	Be a ""sane paranoïd"". People are not always what they pretend to be and scammers are gifted to seduce.
•	Due diligence is the key. You cannot just rely on other people comments, thoughts or so called ""analysis"". The interests of others are not necessarily yours.
•	Invest only what you can afford to lose.
•	Invest in something you do understand. You have to deep dive into the product: who, what, when, how? What about technology, team, market, viability, roadmap, token, supply, market cap, distribution, incentives, etc.
•	Does the product really need to be based on blockchain technology?
•	Is there a market?
•	Ask for informations. Ask again. And again. Exemple.
•	Do they have a product, github, etc?
•	What about the token? Necessary? Useful? What's the use? What about the incentives to use, hold or sell it? Is there a way to sell it?
•	Access to ICO smart contract's code before the ICO? Audited? Terms of ICO / Presale? Website audited?
•	As a token holder, what do you gain?
•	In your country, what are the legal and tax implications as a token buyer/holder/seller?
•	Think about it for a minute: the company is successful and Google buy it. What happens to your investment?
•	There is no free money. If the project sounds too good to be true, just go back to ""sane paranoïd"" mode and take a closer look.
•	Check accounts on reddit (history, karma, redditor since, write to who and in which subreddits).
•	Caution with pyramid / ponzi schemes. How to spot them? 1) Most of the time, guaranteed return on investment. 2) Aberrant interest rates (no one can give you 1% daily, nor 10% monthly. I know you would like it, but be realistic).
•	A lot of ICO rating/due diligence services, forums and websites are in a potential conflict of interests. If the service accept donation: caution. If a company has to pay to be rated or is encouraged to make a donation to expedite the procedure: caution. If the service shill the iCO: caution. If the rating service is also acting as an exchange, intermediary, consultant: caution. Just four examples: IcoBazaar.com, Icodrops.com, Icobench.com and even r/icocrypto which accept donation to support moderation.
•	Spread the awarness.

BTC was not made to be traded, it was made to be a form of currency. It’s only value is what people are willing to pay for it, like supply and demand. It is almost treated like a stock, if the price goes down, everyone will be fighting to get out, and options trading will force the value down fast, like shorting the BTC.

"This has been the best way to go about it. If someone is actually interested in doing this then I tell them to setup a bittrex/binance account and I send them $50 in whatever my short term alts are along with the sell targets for them. And we setup their blockfolio account. This teaches them that one day they'll be up 15% and another they'll be down 40%. But a week later they're up 200%. We practice placing orders and stop losses. 

I show them charts so they can understand the basics of TA (flags, wedges, all that shit). I show them a calendar site so they can see what news is coming down the way for what coin. I show them how to use explorers. I tell them that when bitcoin pumps weak alts bleed out. Show them how to set alarms. I show them my top 5 favorite youtube crypto channels. Who to follow on twitter and telegram.

It's kinda fun to see them research and find their own coins and make their own moves. It gives them an appreciation for how this thing works and what it takes.

Some people offer to give me their money and ask me to trade it for them, but that kinda sucks the fun out of this. I don't want to be responsible for someone elses money. Can't effectively trade under stress like that. Need to be comfy during dips. If I had to cut losses every time a price dropped 10% then their holdings would dwindle down to nothing.

">  I cannot believe people were taking out second mortgages to buy BTC in 2017.

Every time asks me about BTC I try to include the example of morons taking out second mortgages but buy in and make clear the person understands that even if bitcoin skyrockets and you turn your $250,000 loan into $100,000,000 they'd be complete morons. 

Likewise I also make sure they understand that invest and later sell for a nice profit they should not be hard on themselves if they could have made more money. As in ""oh no I turned $1,000 into $5,000 when I really wasn't comfortable with risking losing all of it at that point, but if I'd held on 2 more years I could have had $500,000"" and then launching into a spiral of depression that potentially results in suicide.

"The best advice is just HOLD.  There have been many days where my limit orders have magically hit the low for the buy side and hit the high for the sell. You feel like a genius. But it's also taken a ton of time, mental anguish, staring and refreshing.  Sad part is I've missed some very big run up as even when I pick a high sell limit much higher than the current going exchange rate.  It fills and keeps going much higher.  When I've re entered I've lost fees, exchange fees, and of course a high price etc. I've ended up with definitely less BTC or some alt coins than I should have.  

I do have to say one piece of advice as I exit some coins and buy some others is set a low, low limit exchange ratio price when buying.  Sure you miss out on some buys but they almost always fill because of some flash crash, unsteady hands, fud etc.  

Don't keep changing your limit order buy price higher as those .0001 higher price add up especially when buying the cheapo alt coins, you can sometimes get 50000 more coins but just setting a low limit buy price and not worrying about it.

"I thought another large advantage of Bitcoin was that the transactions were free? Would transaction fees go away after we've hit that critical-point where miners abandon mining? 

It seems everything I have read is wrong and its really making me reconsider. What advantage IS there then? Anonymous transactions and secure transactions. That's about it. Sure maybe Bitcoin has the potential for zero or very little inflation but but it's so volatile that I don't think that's something of importance at this point. Maybe if it stabilizes but as long as new cryptos come out, the market will probably be volatile. 

From my point of view, one thing that Bitcoin has going for it is acceptance by business's as a currency. Maybe in some areas other cryotos are accepted but I only ever see Bitcoin signs. I think that would have an impact on public perception of it as a real currency and not just an investment. I think that will allow it to stabilize. Other cryptos will still exist but mainly as investments which will keep them volatile. This is all just my hypothesis, I guess you could call it.

Wow. (Prepared for the onslaught of downvotes) if you think crypto is your savior from 9-5, get out now.

"Just because something is subjective does not make it magical.

You might think the market value is too high, making it a good time to sell. I might think the market value is too low, making it a good time to buy. Neither one of us knows the future, we just have our own opinions about the intrinsic value of the thing. They call it ""speculation"" for a reason.

Anyone who claims to ""know"" the intrinsic value of a thing is probably trying to sell you that thing. A car salesperson will seem to *know* just how valuable that extended warranty is.";1;1;False;GayloRen;dsbhiml;Warren Buffet:;7o9zo1;https://i.redd.it/epko0verp7801.jpg

"> Just because something is subjective does not make it magical.

If intrinsic value is indeed subjective, then pretty much every single person in this sub has been using it wrong.

Perhaps a better claim for me to make is ""There's no such thing as *objective* value"".

Blocknet is like Ark but it's been in development longer and very much under the radar right now.
