Hello u/PineappleFund, it's great to see that you have even increased your support to SENS Research Foundation and the related Methuselah Foundation.

Keep up the good work! Please consider donating even more to SENS / Methuselah as these donations hugely speed up the development towards a world where aging has been brought under medical control.

"Damn, I snapped like 4 poles but actually never hurt myself while snapping a pole. Hurt myself constantly in other ways (pulled ab, pulled pec, injured shoulder, sprained ankle, hurt my back, shin splints...I don't even know what else), but actually never got hurt while snapping a pole.

I think my most unique pole vaulting injury might also be the best metaphor for people who bought Bitcoin at 19K. I had what seemed like a good jump, but somehow managed to completely lose my forward momentum and just sort of balanced on the pole in midair. Not really wanting to deal with an approximately 8 foot drop from where my feet hung to the ground, I quickly slid down the pole and literally burned the grip tape onto my hands.
