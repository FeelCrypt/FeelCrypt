Hello u/PineappleFund, it's great to see that you have even increased your support to SENS Research Foundation and the related Methuselah Foundation.

Keep up the good work! Please consider donating even more to SENS / Methuselah as these donations hugely speed up the development towards a world where aging has been brought under medical control.

I think my most unique pole vaulting injury might also be the best metaphor for people who bought Bitcoin at 19K. I had what seemed like a good jump, but somehow managed to completely lose my forward momentum and just sort of balanced on the pole in midair. Not really wanting to deal with an approximately 8 foot drop from where my feet hung to the ground, I quickly slid down the pole and literally burned the grip tape onto my hands.
