"> The problem with blaming this on the Fed is that it's illegal for the Fed to ...

Nobody is blaming the hardworking American interns who keep the show going, or even the true believers who end up in its priesthood.  We are all questioning belief in the institution itself, and its faith driven formulas for making our lives better.  It's true: we never seem to remember why handouts to other people make our lives better than handouts to us.  Why doesn't the reeducation work on us?

Our vision is not myopically set on what to do with laws the way they are now.  Our timeline is broad.  We haven't picked this viewpoint, but are forced into it by our personal horror stories -- which you see every day here -- about people forced to look for alternatives after injustices trying to use the legacy fiat banking system, even in its newer ""fintech"" incarnations.  This matters because these events change who we are in a way that isn't temporary.

What is the viewpoint?  Inflationary paper money is not a new idea, the founders were not stupid about what they wrote in the US Constitution about coinage, and the US is on its *third* central bank for a reason.  

We are noticing that IOER is a multi-decade handout.  We don't think the emergency bailouts are going to strengthen a system that improves our lives, but have rather encouraged more regulatory capture.  

We don't want to save the world with formulaic interest rate manipulation, we want our savings to survive and we want freedom when we spend.  We are dropping out so that the formulas don't marshall us to the commands of some *Economist Generalissimo*.  

Some of us are trading to make a lot of ""money"" (measured in fiat), but most of us just save, which we call hodling.  The real opportunity here is paid for in attention; a viewpoint we're sharing: incorporating this economic blasphemy.

**TL;DR:** You don't need any priesthood. 

P.S.  Basic income will be great for a while.  Since consumption will change drastically, it will drive asset bubbles.   This will create further inequality, which will require more redistribution -- a feedback loop -- which will be cured with high taxes.  Higher taxes mean a larger percentage of the economy under government rules.  When the US government controls the economy it becomes more totalitarian, because nobody trusts the US government and the US government does not trust its citizens.  This is all fundamentally central planning, but basic income tries to short-circuit the stupidity of planning by funnelling all of it into redistribution politics.  That will get quite hot.  In case you haven't noticed, the free variable even under a successful totalitarian redistribution system that destroys the inherent inequality of asset ownership is the value of USD.

"Since 2008, the Fed printed some $33 trillion in money designed to rescue companies friendly to the government and powerful enough to have political-capital to play.

Would you actually call that an apolitical move?

Because if politics had nothing to do with it, then Fed would've printed *nothing* and allowed companies to fail. In fact, a lot of banks did fail, or were forced to be purchased by other banks by the government, and it was Fed money that made that possible.

We also know the government has a market-rescue service that started up in the Reagan era, where do you think they get their money:

The meetings that they do have that happen behind closed doors should have plausible reasons for secrecy.  For example, I could see a subcommittee in congress that discusses foreign intelligence not publishing its transcripts or minutes that relate to ongoing conflicts.

I am sure congress would like to greatly extend the meetings that they can have behind closed doors and probably tries to make that argument often.

"> Had the Fed not done that, we would have entered a second Great Depression.

How do you know? You are making a claim that cannot be at all proven. The only way to prove it would've been to let it happen and see what results. But since we instead acted strongly against that, then we cannot know at all what would've happened.

Austrian theory suggests we would've faced a sharp and painful, but quick, recession, even depression, but that this correction would put the economy back onto a footing to achieve real future growth. And we would face such a sharp mini-depression precisely because it's a correction for all the monkeying in the economy the government has been doing to forestall past recessions.

Had we simply let the corrections happen in the past they would be small and tolerable, but now they are building up into a tsunami.

Instead of that, we spent $33 trillion to avoid a sharp recession, and now we face flat stagnation for the last decade+.

Study the Japanese stagnation over the last 25 years, and now they've gone full Keynesian with Abenomics, trying to desperately spend their way out of a slump and it's simply not working.

So too the US will face increasingly muddy stagnation until we stop trying to control the economy.";1;1;False;Anen-o-me;dk7z3hp;Guy just did this on live tv;6mut9d;https://i.redd.it/nsokakmrn69z.jpg

You seem to be arguing that the FED is capable of fine-tuning the economy through a deep understanding of financial engineering that is lacking in congress, the presidency, and the forces and institutions in the broader public that actively engage in the public debate over economic policy.  They can, for example, fine tune their interest rate adjustments to account for slight changes in the unemployment rate.

"Interesting stuff! My guess, that much money was probably a swap with foreign banks. Basically a loan in which we hold their foreign currency as collateral.

">Austrian theory suggests we would've faced a sharp and painful, but quick, recession, even depression, but that this correction would put the economy back onto a footing to achieve real future growth.

Modern orthodox macroeconomics suggest that the way to deal with recessions is through the buying of bonds (and in this case toxic assets too) by the fed and increasing government deficit spending. This injects cash into the economy, encourages borrowing, increases employment, etc.

Could you elaborate on how this causes long run stagnation?

>Study the Japanese stagnation over the last 25 years, and now they've gone full Keynesian with Abenomics, trying to desperately spend their way out of a slump and it's simply not working.

From what I’ve seen, Japanese stagnation has much more to do with low consumption by an aging population and a very low rate of population growth due to low immigration and birth rates. The Japanese economy isn’t expanding due to land or labor, so the only route is capital, which hasn’t been enough.";1;1;False;my_name_is_worse;dk8b3u5;Guy just did this on live tv;6mut9d;https://i.redd.it/nsokakmrn69z.jpg

>They feel safe with being frank about it because it's released ten years later when Donald's out of power, and they don't have to worry as much about short-term political pressures.

Are you suggesting that the Fed's job is to second guess the economic policies that congress, the president, and the american people discuss openly and to take covert corrective action to derail things they don't like?  That the tools of monetary policy the FED has been entrusted with are a lever so powerful and pervasive in their effects that they could override almost any other economic policy?

I can't believe you just admitted that.

I'll grant you that that would be a reason to keep the record sealed for a whole 10 years.  But its not the kind of reason that can stand the light of day.  Its not the sort of thing anyone would *say out loud*.
