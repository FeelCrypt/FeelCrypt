"You don't need free. Negligible would work. You could make the argument fiat currencies have 'fees', you just don't see them. Someone is paying for those dollar bills to be printed. Fees are integral to the market in this case. This is the breakthrough part of this whole ecosystem. You now have a decentralized ecosystem with a monetary incentive to participate. 



Don't forget about venture capital, literally billions of dollars. Also consider there are a bunch of developers in the space that have sold bitcoin along the way to continue working. See Andreas Antonopolous as an example. He spent his bitcoin so he could continue to work in the space, and it's not a stretch to say others have as well. That is time and effort ($$) in the space. Look at all the ICO's and how much money went their way this year alone. Many of the companies converted to fiat because of bitcoins volatility, of course they would not keep all their funds there. The point is, they have funds for the next couple of years easy. There's still a lot of uncertainty, but its false to say there is isn't a single dollar in the bitcoin space. Just take a look at how many developer tools are being downloaded. There's a ton of people working on this space. That is of value, in the space itself.

Another here with ME/CFS and a lost career at the peak of life.  We need a biomarker and FDA-approved treatments.  OMF is doing aggressive cutting-edge work and collaborating with a team of researchers worldwide.  The NIH has denied multiple grant proposals, but patient support through private donations has kept them advancing.  They have strategic plans in the works to answer questions and cover research gaps that must be addressed to move the research.  OMF puts every penny to work and is focussed on keeping medical costs down.  There is good reason that the patient community is behind this organization, they are doing real science to help millions of people return to health and living their lives.

There's two food banks / community centers, an environmental advocacy/action group and a scholarship, tutoring and student support fund for those who had to drop out due to financial issues (hard to go to school when you need two full-time jobs).

"Hi,

fantastic to see your approach to this - I'd love to be in a position to do exactly what you're doing

I can't lie, if I found myself in your position, I would most definitely go down the lambo/nice car/holidays etc route, but I'd like to think my spends would also be very large amounts to charity like you :-)

Anyway, to your original Q OP:

I'd like to put forward any charities involved in research and support for Dystonia

https://www.reddit.com/r/Dystonia/

I am a sufferer myself, but am fortunate enough to be one of those that only has (reasonably) mild symptoms

I have, however, met many that are severely disabled by this awful disease which very little is known about (I myself had seen many doctors with various symptoms from my early teens, but i was only diagnosed in my early 30's)

As a brief run down, Dystonia is similar to the symptoms of Parkinson's disease, but ifs more often than not non degenerative (Parkinsons symptoms are in fact secondary Dysonia, in that the Dystonic movement (spasms etc) are secondary to the main Parkinson's disease, whereas in Primary Dystonia it is in and off itself)

As I have said, my symptoms are quite mild, but I have the rarer form, global Dystonia that can affect many parts of the body - I myself suffer from severe writers cramp (it hurts to write more than a sentence), weakness in the right leg, and, for me at least, the worst - Laryngeal Dysphonia that makes me sound very, very hoarse to the point phone calls are near impossible and face to face conversations quite difficult, especially as strangers often assume I have a stammer.

For me, a very social, outgoing person this is a nightmare, but as I have said, mild compared to others I have met.

I feel very, very little is known of Dystonia both in the medical profession and the public at large and so this would be an area that would benefit greatly from a decent donation to assist awareness and research.

I am aware that you have a VERY large amount of responses, so if you do read this I thank you for your time to read my 2 cents!

Whether you decide to donate to Dystonia or not, I congratulate you on your approach to this new found wealth, and wish you the very best in finding a way to achieve the most for humanity with your generous gifts.

"Here is a french innovative and cooperative project of a place in Paris, by a young cooperative called Samouraï Coop. The project called ""TERAA"" (*Terminal of Exchanges and Resources About Autonomy) is created as a P2P project including people from french guetto to make them autonomous from financial system, and politics.
They want to promote informations, resources, and projects about culture, food, health, blockchain of course, school, and energy... and team is composed of great engineers, artist, teachers, crypto experts and creative people... ! 

Its a hudge project which need about 3,5 m$ to buy and rehab a building for this cooperative place.
I think you could love this project... and the team is really serious and professionnal, working as ""samouraï"" since 2014 !

They need support... !
https://www.cooperativesamourai.com/projet-teraa

If they successfully buy & rehab the building, the project make money for people around, and make free culture, free tools and free lessons for autonomy ! Its a disruptive project which really need attentions from crypto community, cause the team is in a non-profit way to work, and really need help from all over the world to go forward !

In ten or twenty years, the concept of TERAA will be duplicated as a P2P world project of places to cooperate and learn about autonomy !

"My considered advice to fund recipients is to hodl the Bitcoin; don't sell your Bitcoin; keep it held as Bitcoin (in safe wallets held by you with your good management).  Spend it an equal % per year equal to your time horizon for your charity.  Such as, if it will take 40 years to bring desalinated drinking water using slant wells and solar panels to all of Africa, then only spend 2.5% of your Bitcoin per year.  The reason is, the Bitcoin will go up in value, so each year, you can grow along with your Bitcoin.

If you sell all your Bitcoin now, you will miss out on BILLIONS OF DOLLARS for your charity.  DON'T BE STUPID!  Hold and spend the Bitcoin a little at a time equal to your time horizon.

Get multiple good wallets and good wallet management.  Use only cold storage with multiple locations and multiple signers.  DO NOT BE STUPID!  This requires good conservative management with good conservative experienced programmers, logicians and accountants, which ought to be in ample supply in your charity already if it means to do any good (well, the way I see the world).  If not ... I don't know how to find them, but don't take the first thief off the streets, or the first thief out of the silk gowns.

Remember:  Bitcoin will drop many times.  Look at the 9 year chart for Bitcoin price.  Zoom out, then zoom in, then zoom out.  OK?  Your job is to hold during drops, not to sell.  In fact, your job is to do nothing.

Have multiple wallets.  Some wallets are holding wallets and some are spending wallets.  Only move the correct % in the correct period to the spending wallets; that is, once per year, move 2% or whatever of your Bitcoin into the spending wallets.";1;1;False;Bwa_aptos;drdqssu;I'm donating 5057 BTC to charitable causes!

"For advice I would suggest you talk to the experts at Open Philanthropy Project https://www.openphilanthropy.org/. They are giving away a huge sum of money to a variety of causes based on the principles of Effective Altruism - using careful evidence and analysis to do the most good we can. It is funded mostly by Dustin Moskowitz (Facebook and Asana), and has GiveWell's founders as part of the management team. 

Open Phil's processes are extremely rigorous, and they fund a wide variety of projects including highly evidence based organisations like Against Malaria Foundation, as well as far more speculative projects which have high risk but potentially high reward such as funding pandemic preparedness research. 

I'm sure the good people at Open Phil will be very happy to advise you. ";2;0;False;cafelow;drd2yvu;I'm donating 5057 BTC to charitable causes! Introducing The Pineapple Fund;7jj0oa;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7jj0oa/im_donating_5057_btc_to_charitable_causes/

Please consider donating to Southern Research’s STEM Outreach program. We bring stimulating, hands-on learning experiences focusing on science, technology, engineering and math to students across the state of Alabama. Alabama's students have performed poorly on national standardized tests, with proficiency levels ranging from 23 to 39 percent. Many Alabama students unfortunately attend high schools where classes like Algebra 2, chemistry and physics are not even offered. A donation from the Pineapple Fund would enable us to renovate an old library space into a STEM lab where schools can bring their students to engage in laboratory learning experiences lead by scientists and engineers. A donation would empower the many diverse communities of Alabama and stimulate the state’s STEM learning environment. Regaining and promoting science and math literacy is imperative to the future of our students. We would be grateful for a donation of any size as any contribution will make a significant impact on Alabama students. ;1;0;False;ChemistryKat1;drde6bg;I'm donating 5057 BTC to charitable causes!
