"> The only place that 'bitcoin investors' are getting money from is later investors.   

If I buy gold at $1500/oz and sell it at $2000/oz, does that make gold a Ponzi? No, it just means that demand has increased faster than supply. It's the same thing with bitcoin.  

This post explains this all in greater detail, citing the World Bank report that concludes that bitcoin is not a Ponzi. https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/world-bank-bitcoin-not-ponzi-scheme/

"Electrum is a pretty good wallet to start out with. It's pretty much plug-and-play, when it comes to use. Just download, launch... and you should be ready to go.

Coinbase would not be optimal. I don't know for sure, because they've blocked Guatemala... but from what I could research, it seems you can only buy and sell at current price, which leaves you at a disadvantage. With that kind of trading, you'd need to be continuously logged in and very attentive to current price. Bitcoin's volatility is very much moment-to-moment. With bitfinex, you don't need to be so active all the time. That's where Limit Orders come in handy. When it comes to buying and selling, there are different types of orders that can help you set the rules you want for your buys and sells. Market, Limit, and Stop-limit are the ones I use and like the most. the TL;DR explanation for each is as follows

- Market: The current price is good for me! Hook me up with the current buy offer or sell offer. Sell/buy right now.

- Limit: There is a certain price I want to buy or sell at. When the buy or sell offer matches the price I've set to buy or sell at, the exchange will make that buy/sell for me. Buy/sell at the price I set, whenever it happens.

- Stop-Limit: If the price hits a price I set, create a limit order at another price I've set. 

These are available to you in Bitfinex.

... And lastly...

Yes. Ideally with bitcoin, because that way you can move bitcoin from one exchange to another in under an hour. The only issue could be transfer fees, but they're usually not too big.";1;0;False;BlackSpidy;dofh373;Bitcoin breaks $5500, less than one day after it broke $5000.;761ri4;https://i.redd.it/f2p8tajk9irz.gif
"It assumes bitcoin won't be overtaken, which doesn't seem out there to me.
