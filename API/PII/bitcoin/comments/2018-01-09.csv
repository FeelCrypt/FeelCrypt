I think we're still friends, we're just in a fight. And I didn't call your mom an idiot. I said she's *either* an idiot *or* a liar. ;2;0;False;HugeVagina2;dsedag6;Everyone who's trading BTC right now;7olruz;http://cdn.mutually.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/08-19.jpg

Well, you called my mom an idiot. We're not friends anymore. Doesn't mean I can't be nice to your mom.";2;1;False;kuenx;dse6736;Everyone who's trading BTC right now;7olruz;http://cdn.mutually.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/08-19.jpg
Well what country are we talking about? It would be a ridiculous system if that were true. I told my mom that you wished her a nice day and she said thank you, but it was kinda rude to only wish her a wonderful day and not me too, it made the whole thing kind of awkward. ;2;1;False;HugeVagina2;dse50ld;Everyone who's trading BTC right now;7olruz;http://cdn.mutually.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/08-19.jpg
Good for you man/women! You invested in the right time. I lost all my life saving with my bitcoin wallet. I guess world works like this happiness for some sadness for others. Anyway this life is not worth living for me anymore. But I am happy that people like you exist who are using there money to do right in this world.;1;0;False;IamDumb1234;dseus4u;I'm donating 5057 BTC to charitable causes!

Hey Crypto, just wondering where my Bitcoin is from the transaction you made with me around a week ago, or if it's even coming. 95.75 is a lot of money.;1;0;False;L1kea13osS;dse2qxn;Warren Buffet:;7o9zo1;https://i.redd.it/epko0verp7801.jpg
"Bitcoin is far more volatile than stocks, which is a bad thing if seeking less risk, which is what you want to do when the stock market is tanking, you fucking dumbass. You'd only be mitigating losses if crypto moved opposite of stocks, which isn't a reasonable assumption, at all. If you're seeking less risk you go for assets with lower standard deviation (volatility), not higher.

You're probably thinking of diversifying to avoid correlation, but are new to playing make believe investor so you don't know what you're actually doing yet. It's ok, we all learn somehow, and ""diversify"" is still a good thing to have learned even if you could have learned it from pretty much any movie involving the stock market.

Learn basic investing. I did, spent 6 years doing it professionally. Bitcoin speculation isn't investing.";1;0;False;72_hairy_virgins;dseb7gj;Warren Buffet:;7o9zo1;https://i.redd.it/epko0verp7801.jpg
