I work as a camera operator in the entertainment industry in Los Angeles. If you have ever seen dailies or been on set when the actor regurgitates their lines in front of a camera you’d know what I’m talking about. It’s really the editors, camera directions and sound design that sell the scene.  Actors are useless human beings who regurgitate lines in front of a camera get paid obscene amounts of money and get treated like deities for doing nothing.  And all of you buy into it, just like you buy into apple products.  ;1;1;False;;ebj1xyn;Sold my portfolio today and got myself a LAMBO!!!;a4q9ye;https://v.redd.it/f5rnd8socc321
