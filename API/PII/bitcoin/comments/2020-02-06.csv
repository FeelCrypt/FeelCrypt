"One doesn't transfer USD or any other currency into a Bitcoin wallet. Only Bitcoin can be transferred into a Bitcoin wallet. Aside from mining (creating original coins) the only way to acquire Bitcoin is to buy it (either directly or through an intermediary such as an exchange) from an individual or an organization that already owns Bitcoin.

"Besides the snark in the comments here -- another risk not addressed here is the systematic risk inherent in these lending markets.  For example -- say you lend 10BTC to BlockFi.  That is as much as you know.  What you do not know is who BlockFi lends it out to, and then who those people lend it out to.  What happens when there is a rare event or a large default?  The ripple effect will travel back up the pipeline and leave the lenders with their paltry 5.1% interest.  

I think it is fine to lend crypto on some of these platforms, but it is in no way ""free"" money.  The best approach would be to take a rules- based approach based on your own experience and tolerance to lose your BTC.  Say you are willing to risk 10 BTC to gain some interest.  That is fine, but just understand there are REAL risks to doing this and the rare events do happen.

"if you would rather spend that $100 on movies/fancy clothes/entertainment or things that do not grow your asset/portfolio, I think putting that into Bitcoin is a good decision.

Halving is around the corner. The cost of producing one Bitcoin now is $7000. After halving the cost of producing one Bitcoin will be $14000, given the difficulty does not decrease. If we look at the difficulty chart, we will know the difficulty only climbs over the long term.

Some may argue that Bitcoin will not necessarily moon that much because people who acquired Bitcoin earlier will sell into fiat to make a profit. Well that's true only to a certain extent, because the constant sell pressure is actually from the miners. Miners has no choice other than to sell the mined Bitcoin because they pay rent and electricity in fiat.

For many Bitcoin believers we will never sell all of our Bitcoin. May be 20%, may be 70%, but never capitulate fully into fiat. Look at fiat now. We have QE-forever. Governments printing money like nobody business. It will only dilute the value of fiat. Overtime the price of asset will go up because they gradually worth more in terms of the lesser-value fiat.

And the financial trend now is zero or negative interest. Previously when the interest rate is positive, there is incentive to store cash in bank to earn interest. Hence previously holding bitcoin or gold looks a little less attractive because they do not pay interest. The only way to profit is to wait for their appreciation in value. But now! we have negative interest rate policy. Suddenly holding bitcoin or gold looks attractive because storing cash with bank makes you pay for it.

"If you are holding your own keys (via a hardware wallet like Trezor, or a software wallet like Electrum, BRD, Coinomi, etc), then there's no institution with the capability to send your coins to the government, so escheatment is impossible.

Where escheatment could theoretically become an issue is in a custodial wallet or trading platform, like Gemini, Coinbase (not their wallet), Binance, etc. I am honestly not sure if the existing escheatment laws have been interpreted to include cryptocurrency, but if you decide you have to leave your crypto on these custodial platforms (not a great idea long-term), I'd at least make sure I log in occasionally so my account isn't deemed inactive, just in case.";1;1;False;fsh5;fgp6wlt;How does escheat work?;ezsssf;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ezsssf/how_does_escheat_work/
"If you use a custodial wallet, presumably they will comply with local laws in their jurisdiction.

If you (solely) control the keys, then you have full custody of the coins.

Now this is specific to bitcoin, which was built to be resistant to censorship, and resistant to corruption of the ledger history data.   Other ""cryptos"" don't have bitcoin's protection, which comes from its incredibly massive mining network.

For instance, ... after the ""DAO hack"", Ethereum developers produced a fork that caused a ""transfer"" of certain ETH funds.   Most of the Ethereum community adopted that fork and those funds were ""transferred"".  (Though, some did not adopt that fork, and that side lives on yet today as ETC.) 

But that's what happens if you are an ETHerhuffer, ... and doesn't happen in bitcoinland.    The only time anything remotely similar happened was in 2013 when an update to Bitcoin Core code caused discovery of certain behavior of the bitcoin client, and miners had to ""51% attack"" their own blocks to ""roll back"" the chain to using the client that existed before the update.  This caused at least one exchange with a confirmed transaction to lose that transaction (which went from confirmed with at least six confirmations to being invalid).

But it is very, very unlikely a change that implements anything that could be used for compliance with ""escheat"" laws would ever get accepted by the economic nodes running the bitcoin protocol.";1;0;False;cointastical;fgp9kbh;How does escheat work?;ezsssf;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ezsssf/how_does_escheat_work/
"You got some good answers here (and one dickish one). The escheatment laws relate to the treatment of abandoned property, so as long as your crypto is in your possession (a hardware wallet) it can not be legally seen as “abandoned” any more than a $20 bill sitting in your leather wallet for several years.  

Then there’s the practicality of it: unless it is held by a third party, there is no way it can be returned to the government, meaning there would be nobody to actually escheat the crypto. 

So, get it off an exchange and you’ll be fine (advice that is far more appropriate to guard against theft by a bad actor than to prevent an escheatment).";1;0;False;nomoredamnusernames;fgpiuk2;How does escheat work?;ezsssf;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ezsssf/how_does_escheat_work/

"You have more to read. Short answer: mining adapts. If blocks are not mined every 10 minutes (on average across 2 weeks), then the algorithm decides that from now on mining will be slightly easier.
This means that if the price drops, and some miners quit, then after two weeks it will be easier to mine again.
On the other side scarcity increases, and more people and institutions would want to have money that nobody can print in large percentages, not even their political or economical rivals.
The interesting question is whether the mining companies unite to a single one and risk the fairness of the network (for example, ignore transactions from/to specific addresses and never add them to a block, because some government pressured them).";3;1;False;AvailableHorse;fgp7z6g;Economics of Bitcoin after halving;ezsh1z;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ezsh1z/economics_of_bitcoin_after_halving/

"OK, so the the minor miners will be pushed out of business. So what? Bitcoin is not about helping poor people print money. It's about preventing governments and banks from printing infinite amount of money, confiscating people's money, preventing transactions, lending more money than they have and arbitrarily tax us.

The question is whether the big miners betray us: prevent transactions, try double-spending, etc. In my opinion, they will shoot themselves in the leg. A fork called ""Bitcoin 2"" will be created immediately (with everybody's balance untouched) which makes the old miners obsolete (for example, by changing the hash algorithm). The public will then have to decide which Bitcoin they trust more - Bitcoin 1 or Bitcoin 2. The difference between this and Bitcoin Cash/Gold is that the Bitcoin Cash/Gold were created out of greed and not out of mistrust in the fairness of the original Bitcoin.

This will be a saving grace for the millennials who’ve been screwed out of wealth creating opportunities if they take the chance.

gold spot price (and therefore its SOV) isnt based on its use in jewellery, electronics or dentistry. It is based on it being sound money due to it being finite in supply AND desirable by others.

People own gold jewellery (and diamonds) because they want to show others they are wealthy enough to own something worth a lot but it doesnt mean much to them, so they wear it in public. 

I guess you could rock a necklace with a 25BTC unpeeled Casascius coin as a pendant. Thats a cool 250k on your neck right there.

"Good morning Bitcoin Land ;-)

Well Thursday mid week is upon us, and i hope you have been **""Stacking $ats""** every little helps. In fact
with the state of the current world events and the incoming implosion of the legacy stock markets, Bitcoin will become as scarce as surgical face masks.

What you're witnessing ""live"" is the same old corrupt set of people at the HELM, steaming full speed into the largest Iceberg known to mankind. They are supported by a MSM propaganda machine that is so vast yet centralised by a few, supported by subservient Sheeple who troll and shill on their behalf, equivalent to turkeys voting for Xmas.

The virus has no political affiliation or bias on who it will cull, but it will reset and change the ""business as usual"" norm, as you will all see. 


**Meanwhile**

- Death toll from the coronavirus outbreak has passed 560 after Chinese authorities announced 70 new deaths and more than 3,000 new cases.

- Wisconsin confirms first case of coronavirus, bringing US total to 12.

- Hong Kong closes borders with mainland.

- Cruise ship quarantined in Hong Kong, 10 more cases identified aboard Diamond Princess in Japan.

- First babies born infected with coronavirus.

- Adidas closes China stores over virus outbreak.

- People panic buying toilet paper in Hong Kong.

- Number of quarantine citizens in US approaches 400.

- Shanghai authorities recommend suspending all sports event in city, putting F1 GP in doubt.

- Tokyo Olympics chief says coronavirus could disrupt olympic games.

- Taiwan bans all international cruise ships from docking.

- All schools in Shanghai are forbidden to open before the end of February.

A public key and an address are 2 different things. Public key is a token that allows you to view all of your addresses, an address is just what you send funds to. All of your addresses and public key are derived from your private key. None of those can change, they're permanently engrained into the protocol. What I meant was there are computer viruses that watch the clipboard on your computer, and if you copy a bitcoin address to it to paste somewhere else, the virus will replace it with a different address to trick you into sending money to a stranger, typically the person that created the virus.;-2;2;False;Usher_Techs;fgok1sb;Avoiding burn addresses;ezoboq;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ezoboq/avoiding_burn_addresses/

This is incorrect. Each address has a corresponding private key and public key. A single priv/pub key is not used to derive multiple addresses. You may be thinking of an xpub or xpriv key, which include the chaincode that can derive child keys (and addresses).

an exchange is not a wallet. it's a custodian, a service. best practice is to move your funds off of the exchange and risk as little as possible with them.  not only may they get hacked, or fail as a business, and take your funds, but they can freeze your funds or censor your transactions.  use an open-source non-custodial wallet.  if you have a significant amount to store, use a hardware wallet to greatly reduce the chance of being victim of malware.;5;0;False;dietrolldietroll;fgocz9s;should i use coinbase pro as wallet and to start trading with bitcoins?;ezn88i;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ezn88i/should_i_use_coinbase_pro_as_wallet_and_to_start/
"> **should i use coinbase pro as wallet** 

No. Leaving bitcoin on an exchange is asking for trouble. Once you've bought your bitcoin, send it to a wallet you have full control over. If the exchange is hacked or their website goes offline, your bitcoin is gone with it. Choose a robust option. Hardware wallets provide the most peace of mind - if you're planning on buying triple digits worth (or getting to that point) save yourself the heartache and just buy a hardware wallet. Ledger (S or X), Trezor (one or T), Bitbox02 and Coldcard v3 are all fine candidates. Choose your poison, pay close attention to the set up and you'll be fine.

>**and to start trading with bitcoins?** 

You shouldn't really be trading bitcoin in the short term - too many tax issues with this. Buy some, hold some and if you spend some, buy some more to replace it.

There are only ever going to be 21MM BTC. We cannot quantitive ease and create more as with the USD. Each fraction you own cannot be replicated. It is finite. 

Define your own end goal. Some have a plan to sell out totally when BTC hits a specific price. I am an advocate for the decentralised nature of digital money- I don't need nor want middlemen like Visa, Mastercard or the banks moving my money around. BTC can and will revolutionise the local economies of communities, buy some, hold some and be an early adpoter of the paradigm shift to come.";3;0;False;MrFiFox;fgon78r;should i use coinbase pro as wallet and to start trading with bitcoins?;ezn88i;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ezn88i/should_i_use_coinbase_pro_as_wallet_and_to_start/

I wouldn't keep anything on any exchange that I wasn't 100% happy to lose.

If you're willing to see up to $4,000 tied up and potentially lost forever because your account is randomly banned, you do you. This sounds scaremongering but it does happen. Hacks aside, companies shut down accounts for no reason all the time, especially if they are being very compliant with law as Coinbase are.

"That's a hard question. Bear in mind Bitcoin and other blockchain-like stuff is still very new and barely left the womb. There's a lot of experimenting going on, but no one can really predict which applications will become mainstream. Anyone who makes a prediction about the future is biased.   
Anyone who gives cons is biased, as you give the downsides of a certain future, which may or may not happen.

"**Dollar cost averaging**

Dollar cost averaging (DCA) is an investment strategy that aims to reduce the impact of volatility on large purchases of financial assets such as equities. Dollar cost averaging is also called the constant dollar plan (in the US), pound-cost averaging (in the UK), and, irrespective of currency, unit cost averaging, incremental trading, or the cost average effect.By dividing the total sum to be invested in the market (e.g., $100,000) into equal amounts put into the market at regular intervals (e.g., $1,000 per week over 100 weeks), DCA seeks to reduce the risk of incurring a substantial loss resulting from investing the entire lump sum just before a fall in the market. Dollar cost averaging is not always the most profitable way to invest a large sum, but it is alleged to minimize downside risk. The technique is said to work in markets undergoing temporary declines because it exposes only part of the total sum to the decline.

"Nobody knows the future price.

What you could do is follow Dollar Cost Averaging. That's where you spread your buys over a certain period of time. e..g, 6 months, you buy $50 each month, to get you investing your target of $300 (for an example).

If the exchange rate goes down from here, great, your average price for your position will be less than ~$9.5K per BTC. If the exchange rate goes up from here, great, you got at least some at ~$9.5K per, which you wouldn't have gotten had you sat on the $300 for six months and bought all at once then.

There's still the risk of it going down after you purchase, but this strategy is one that works for many who struggle with FOMO or who stress over trying to time the market.

My take is easy, there two options:

1: One doesn't care about price, just keep buying 

2: One does care about price, just think of the price you expect/ want it to reach and then realize it really doesn't matter what the exact price is when buying, so just buy.

My non-financial advice is to start now, but just a little at a time. The price is somewhat high right now but you have to start sometime. It could go higher or lower. No one can say with 100% accuracy. If it heads lower , buy at each  large dip. If it heads higher just keep buying your small amount each week or whatever interval you decide. Pay attention to the price because bitcoin is known for big price pullback. You dont want to miss them. But dont sit around too long waiting for one, always keep buying what you can afford. If you keep waiting for the exact right time to get in you will always be waiting.

"Dollar cost averaging works across the whole 4 year cycle in general. Although it’s best to start when bottom is confirmed, which it was in Nov 2018. 

This close to the halving and possible start to a 2 year bull run cycle I would suggest you buy in now balls deep.

>XBT Provider ETN

>The Bitcoin ETNs (exchange-traded notes) by XBT Provider can be bought and sold on the Nasdaq Stockholm stock exchange in euros or Swedish krona since 2015. They enable both retail and institutional investors to gain regulated exposure to bitcoin (BTC) and, since October 2017, also to Ether (ETH).

>U.S. investors who want to purchase the Bitcoin ETN, however, will have to expose themselves to added currency risk as the ETNs are currently only available in SEK and USD.

>Investors are charged a 2.5 percent annual management fee for holding the Bitcoin One Trackers.

>The Bitcoin Investment Trust

>Grayscale Investments’ Bitcoin Investment Trust was launched in 2013 to provide accredited investors with the opportunity to purchase bitcoin in the form of a regulated investment vehicle. Investors can purchase shares in the over-the-counter traded investment fund that holds bitcoin as an underlying asset on behalf of its shareholders.

>Investors are charged a two percent annual management fee for holding shares in the Bitcoin Investment Trust.

>Blockchain ETFs

>Moreover, there are also a number of blockchain ETFs that invest in blockchain stocks on behalf of their investors.

"If you are worried about losing potential gains after selling on Revolut before buying on an exchange, then take a look at hedging with leverage or derivatives.

For example, on something like Kraken, you can buy more than the amount of funds you have in the account.  So let's say you have 0.2BTC on Revolut.  What you can do is first deposit a ""seed"" of $200 to Kraken.  When that is available for trading, you can use that $200 to buy 0.06 BTC at Kraken (using nearly 3:1 leverage),  The moment that buy occurs, you then sell the same amount of BTC (0.06 BTC) on Revolut, yielding proceeds of ~$600, which you withdraw to your bank. 

As soon as the Revolut funds arrive to your bank, you then transfer that $600 to Kraken.  When it is available for trading you use that $600 to buy 0.14 BTC (uses ends up being even less than 3:1 leverage).  The moment that trade occurs, you then sell the 0.14 BTC remaining balance at Revolut, which yields you about $1,400, which you withdraw.

As soon as the $1,400 in funds from Revolut arrives at your bank, you then transfer that $1,200 to Kraken.   Once those funds are there, you close your margined position.

At that point, if you did everything right, you should a USD balance that lets you buy 0.2 BTC (at whatever the current price is), plus have close to the ~$200 ""seed"" money left over.  Fees might have taken a small chunk of that $200, but when this is all done, you should still have exactly 0.2 BTC plus most of the seed money.

There is the risk of a liquidation though.  Let's say the exchange rate crashes by 30%.  You possibly could run in to margin trouble at 3:1 leverage with a 30% crash in the price.  Hitting this would cause your position to be liquidated.    So if you consider doing this, make sure you understand leverage and risk, and know what the liquidation price is to make sure you get nowhere near that.   Use less than 3:1 leverage, by either increasing the amount of the seed, or by doing a larger number of smaller sized trades, such that your leverage level is lower (e.g., max 2:1, rather than 3:1).";2;1;False;cointastical;fgnz211;Getting crypto off revolut and into BRD;ezkjm5;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ezkjm5/getting_crypto_off_revolut_and_into_brd/

"The whole issue is how many people will eventually choose to be responsible for their own security, no matter if that's a hardware wallet or a seed phrase. 

Most people do not want to learn good OpSec, they don't want to buy a safe, they don't want the buck to stop with them, period. They outsource responsibility to their banks and this is, in a nutshell, what keeps them poor.

The millionaires, meanwhile, DO take responsibility over their own wealth and future. They make their money work for them by keeping it invested. They buy gold and physically store it. They may use banks but typically not just one so as to distribute the risk. 

Bitcoin has to appeal to the millionaires first, who have absolutely no problems buying a hardware wallet and looking after their own security. But yes, to bank the unbanked and empower the middle class, we need Bitcoin to appeal to the masses too, hopefully in something less centralized than a coinbase-like bitcoin-custody bank.  

Hopefully, Zap's new Strike app will be able to get the masses involved with bitcoin without them ever having to use a seed phrase or take custody of coins.

Sorry for your loss. This stings now but you really are lucky to learn this lesson early at a relatively low expense.

"Yes... bitcoin really does test most peoples understanding of OPSEC.  The majority of bitcoin users fail basic opsec tests like these.

My basic tip list.  Tip #14 is the one that would have saved you.

It all comes down to OPSEC and that is a subject far to broad for a reddit post.  There are many good books on the subject and courses on it.  Here are some tips.

1. Always assume every computer / phone you are on has malware and viruses on it.
2. Learn what GPG/PGP is and use it to verify all downloads and messaging.
3. Encrypt your harddrive and your cell phone.
4. Use a 9 digit RNG pin for your cell phone encryption ***NOT*** biometrics.
4. Make all UserIDs RNG generated and unique between accounts.
5. Make all Passwords RNG generated and unique between accounts.
6. Some 2FA is still better than no 2FA.
7. Always use U2F / FIDO (Security Key) based 2FA.  Avoid SMS and TOTP (Google Authenticator).
8. Only use open source software and firmware wherever possible.
9. Always run an AdBlocker or an AdBlocking browser.
9. Pen and paper is better for passwords than dropbox.
9. Make your email security as serious as your exchange account security.
9. Get a protonmail account.
1. If you don't care about privacy, install *Alexa Traffic Rank* and check the rank of all pages to flush out phishers.
1. If you do care about privacy, learn what CRLs are and use them to manually verify SSL certs.
1. The unlock icon in the URL bar means ***UNSAFE*** and avoid using these sites.
1. The lock icon ***DOES NOT*** always imply safety, lots of scammers can get a green lock.
1. Get a HW wallet from the manufacturer not ebay or Amazon.
1. Never use a preloaded seed on a HW wallet.
1. Never enter your seed into a HW wallet's SW or Web interface.
1. Most people are dishonest, assume any interaction with a counter party will result in fraud.";0;0;False;brianddk;fgp7zbe;I lost over $470 because of this phishing ad fake blockchain.com website;ezka6y;https://i.redd.it/j8vuhdoxf7f41.png

"Cash that is being printed isn't going back in your pocket if you lose it. Those who lose cash or btc will lose their money so they best learn how to secure both.

Cash being printed makes it worth less so you need more dollars to buy the same amount of stuff overtime. Btc getting lost makes it worth more so you need less btc to buy the same amount of stuff over time.

Cash isn't being printed to replace stock of lost or destroyed cash. You want to inflate btc to replace lost stock of btc. Cash has its inflation property for other economic reasons.

Btc has its deflationary property, but it is digital and divisible. Note that transactions don't really record number of btc they record number of satoshis. If someone told you bitcoin has limited supply of only 2.1 quadrillion units you might say that's way too fuckin many units. That's half the dollar value of everything on earth. So instead they gave you 42 halfmillion making it 21 million, which is a reasonable number to human brain.  I don't appreciate the deception but it's all relative and works out ok.

"Economists concerned about growth will warn about a deflationary currency being bad.   Individuals owning a currency will find that it has greater spending power when that currency is deflationary.  So they feel richer and thus spend more (known as wealth effect spending).

Either way, bitcoin doesn't have value because of its utility as a currency or payment method.  It has value because of its resistance to censorship.  The speculators might overshoot the mark for the amount of value this censorship-resistance brings, ... or they might undervalue it, ... so there could always be exchange rate volatility, which lessens bitcoin's utility as a currency.

"> could someone find out what I bought and the store I bought it from?

If the merchant was using a merchant payment processor (e.g., BitPay), ... then Coinbase very well could know that your payment went to BitPay.  BitPay would then know the merchant that bitcoin payment went to.   

Coinbase might not know.  But Coinbase uses ""chain analysis"" vendor.  And let's say BitPay uses a ""chain analysis"" vendor.  So it's possible Coinbase would learn from the chain analysis vendor that you had made a purchase from that merchant.  And law enforcement, should they obtain a subpoena,  could definitely know that you had used bitcoin to buy what from where.

Now if I were to try to discover your transaction,... I wouldn't know what bitcoin transaction from Coinbase was yours, because Coinbase doesn't share that information publicly.  

Now let's say the merchant uses Coinbase Commerce, and you use Coinbase, and you are some political figure whose career would be negatively impacted if this transaction were to made public.  Multiple staffers at Coinbase, even many administrative ones, would likely have access to the information, and could leak it (or sell it), without really much of a way for anyone from being able to stop that from occurring.";1;0;False;cointastical;fgo2cne;Question about merchant identity in divorce discovery;ezbeet;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ezbeet/question_about_merchant_identity_in_divorce/

"If you are looking to Sell bitcoin for fiat money, then the methods available will differ based on a few factors:

- Where are you located (country)?
- How much are you looking to sell?
- What methods of payment will you accept?
- How soon do you need access to the proceeds?
- Is financial privacy important?

There are various payment methods for P2P trading, such as buyer deposits cash in your bank account, or transfers the funds to your account.  Know that there are risks in being defrauded when using bank transactions for Bitcoin trading, but if your buyer has a long and excellent trust history the risks are much lower.

"Let's say you are making this payment and ends up the transaction fee paid was a little too low, and now your transaction is taking a long time (couple hours) to get a confirmation.

What are your options?   Contact Cash App?   Good luck.   Contact the party you are paying?  It's not their responsibility to help you along.

If you instead sent from a wallet where you control the keys, you could use replace-by-fee, if for whatever reason the fee was too low.

If you are using a wallet that supports [replace-by-fee](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Replace_by_fee) (RBF), and have it enabled before creating your send transaction, you can feel comfortable going on the lower-end of the transaction fee range. If the transaction doesn't confirm soon enough for you, you simply bump the fee using RBF.

There's also the fee bumping method known as child-pays-for-parent (CPFP). If you send a transaction and the fee was too low, you can spend the ""change"" transaction but double up the fee required. This will cause the miners to look at both transactions as a set, and the combined fees should then be high enough to get both confirmed.  CPFP also can be done if you are the recipient of the funds.

"Nope, in fact as of right now it offers less :P

But the two projects have different goals. Orange is intended to be a user-friendly desktop client. You download and install it like a regular app. BTC RPC Explorer is a web app for technical users. 

You could argue that it's not a big jump for BTC RPC Explorer to go from where it is to being a desktop client, but even then the two projects have dissimilar goals.

With Orange I'm hoping that after nailing down the Explorer features, it will expand to incorporate wallet features, and eventually become a full fledged Bitcoin client that bundles `bitcoind` within it.";3;0;False;msafi;fgnsi8y;Graphical blockchain explorer for Bitcoin Core (under development);ezg8x7;https://github.com/orange-org/orange

"If your argument is that Bitcoin is going to fail because it's flawed and therefore will only be the ""top dog"" until something comes along to topple it, you will have to remember that whatever will supposedly replace Bitcoin will also have to reach a similar level of liquidity. Bitcoin is so, so far ahead of the rest of the cryptocurrency pack that frankly I don't ever see anything overpowering its dominance-- not in our lifetimes.

You don't get trillions of dollars of liquidity purely on the basis that a cryptocurrency is a ""good currency"". You get there on speculation first. The reason fiat currencies have so much liquidity and the FX market is so large is because governments *forces* people to use those currencies.

The only ""insecurity"" on LN is - one party would not want the other party to settle the wrong state, by accident or by cheating.

"Not quite ELI5...but here's a shot:

Lightning is a series of money tubes. Imagine those tubes are actually filled with water+air. There's a dotted line at the center that separates my ""balance"" from yours. When money tubes are created, they start out with a 50:50 air to water ratio. Air on your side means you can receive coins (trading for water), while water is your send ""bandwidth"" (trading for air). An important thing to notice is that money tubes start out with only one person being able to send (give water for air) and one receive (receive water for air). If you receive a lot, then all the water sends up on your side, to the point where you can't ""receive"" anymore. 

(""people"" in this money tube network can also totally just be robots, which is when things start to get _really_ cool)

Loop is a series of ""valves"" in this water-air-money tube network. 

If you want to be able to receive more (more air in your side of the tube), you send your water to our valve receiving a bit less than you sent (the difference is our fee), in your own ""bucket"". This bucket is your hot wallet, cold wallet, someone else's bucket, your account on an exchange, etc. We call this ""Loop Out""; you made a loop _out of_ your money tube via us to your bucket forming a loop. You can use this loop to either re-allocate your air/water (receive/send) ratio, and/or make an on-chain payment (send to a bucket). 

If you want to be able to send more (more water on your side of the tube), we ""push"" through some water from one of your buckets into your end of the tube. Now you're able to send more either within the network (series of money tubes), or outside of the network (back down to layer 1 on-chain bitcoin). Someone can also use send more coins into your money tube from _their_ bucket. We call this ""Loop In""; you made a loop from a bucket via us _into_ your money tube forming a loop. You can use this to either re-allocate your water/air (send/receive) ratio, and/or receive money from layer 1 bitcoin.

This concludes Loop 101. In Loop 102, we'll explore the orchestration (batching) that the system conducts to maximize throughput, and effective utilization of the money tube (LN) to bucket (layer 1 Bitcoin) bridge (jumping back up to dev land...).";13;3;False;roasbeef;fgom5pq;⚡️Announcing Lightning Loop Beta: An On and Off Ramp for the Lightning Network ⚡️;ezdkfp;https://blog.lightning.engineering/announcement/2020/02/05/loop-beta.html

"Just in case it's confusing: Bitcoin literally does NOT reside ""in"" your (or Coinbase's) wallet. It remains permanently on the network (in a ""ledger"" file constantly circulating all over the planet in multiple copies). What wallet does is it manages the keys for you, so you don't have to type them in by hand, plus it offers some extra features like displaying the total you own, etc. It is those keys that give you access to your coins. So while your coins are at Coinbase, *they* (Coinbase) own the keys to them, and only offer you the right to withdraw. People reported having problems with this step now and then for various reasons, like simply an exchange going belly-up or even legal overreach in some cases (whimsical freezing of the funds). 

BTW, theoretically one could get by without any wallet, just by writing down the keys on a piece of paper, but this would get incredibly tedious incredibly fast. Find out about *hardware wallets* like Trezor or Ledger, they are the best for storing coins that you don't immediately need to spend.";2;1;False;JanPB;fgnfbro;I'm new to Bitcoin and have a question.;ezd3e0;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ezd3e0/im_new_to_bitcoin_and_have_a_question/

I would say, it depends on the amount of Bitcoins you are buying. If you are only buying small amounts then there is no need to move it however, if you are storing larger amounts ($50k-100k+), you may look at storing it elsewhere.;1;0;False;GlowingRadiance;fgp9sn9;I'm new to Bitcoin and have a question.;ezd3e0;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ezd3e0/im_new_to_bitcoin_and_have_a_question/
"How would you feel if one day, for whatever reason, Coinbase says ""YOUR BALANCE IS ZERO"".

And then, you will ask, ""What the hell happened to my coins?""

And they respond with, ""We have no clue. Sorry bro. Go hire a lawyer, but good luck - we have way more lawyers than you.""

Okay, now compare that scenario with:

""My bitcoin is in my bitcoin wallet and I own the cryptographic keys and nobody else owns these keys. NOBODY IN THE UNIVERSE, Not the President of the US or even Jesus Christ could come and set the balance to zero.""

That is incredible power.

That hasn't existed in all of human history.

Every other form of money has been able to be confiscated by search-and-seizure.

The only way someone could take your money is if they could read your mind (or you reveal it through interrogation/threat or something). But not from just digging around your house or your bank account.

"Do not use the Blockchain.info wallet!

Do not use any web wallet.

For small amounts get a mobile wallet and move your funds there. For larger amounts buy a hardware wallet. Trezor and Ledger are the most recommended.

"Welcome to the Bitcoin world and kudos for seeking knowledge on the investment opportunity of a lifetime. You're still early in the market. You will hear many giving advice on what's the best for this, what's the best for that, don't use this wallet, etc.   


I started with Coinbase just under three years ago and have never had an issue. But, I also, read and re-read several times before sending any amount anywhere. Let me repeat that, read, re-read, then re-read again before sending anything anywhere! Until you build up a larger portfolio/balance, don't fret leaving your funds on Coinbase or any other exchange that you use. The biggest are the biggest because they are pretty safe. Once you build a balance that you would really freak out if you lost it, then is when you should look into a hardware wallet. (Ledger, Trezor, KeepKey, etc)   


As you gain more experience in the crypto markets, you'll find a wallet that works for you. You might not be comfortable with the most popular. But I also wouldn't take a chance on anything not already proven in the market.   


Full disclosure; I use Coinbase for purchasing and once it builds to a certain amount, I move it to an offline wallet. This is what works for me. You'll find what works for you. But again, until you start building your stack to amounts that would really hurt to lose, don't be overly concerned with exchange security. They didn't get to be among the biggest by continually losing peoples funds.

"I rarely upvote posts but I did for this. This should be a lot higher.

Making a clear entry and exit strategy for any investment is important, even if that plan is as simple as ""never gunna sell"" or ""sell all at 1M."" As long as you research and plan according to your risk/reward profile and adjust as to learn about yourself. Note: NOT adjusting during periods of massive FOMO/FOLE as the point of the plan is to keep control of yourself.

Your plan obviously works for you and your goals. It's important that anyone who makes a plan, understands the impact of various stages and the impact of such events as ""Bitcoin never goes up again"" or ""Bitcoin keeps climbing after you've sold everything.""

So I will say what I see in this plan. For someone young, the end goal in this plan of $240,000 and $10M in BTC means OP wants to work towards supplementary income to a job that could afford them more flexibility and believes in that after Bitcoin reaches 1-2M, it will likely be a usable and broadly accepted currency.

The plan works for him but not for me.

I'm unsure of the ratio, here. Personally, I'd want more money while waiting for Bitcoin to take off and would be happy with less money after universal acceptance. I also believe Bitcoin could hit 1M without full adoption - just not during this cycle.

For myself, I'd adjust the drawn amount upwards. I'd sell less coin initially and more coin later on but bring it back down again. My end result would look more like this (assuming the same 8BTC):

I would personally have many more stops along the way because I don't want to rely on so many numbers so far apart but as you can see, my personal preference it to keep a quarter forever and get out less immediately but more in the medium-term. I've also planned around the bubbles I expect to occur along the way by my varying in sold amount. As you can also see, my biggest irrational fear is it pumping but never actually hitting 100K

Not that I'm going to go ahead and buy 8 BTC anytime soon lol.

And yes, I'm not one of those expecting the total collapse of the current financial system although we are certainly in for a ride both in the medium-short term and in the very long term.

My point to anyone out there is to come up with a plan according to your risk profile. 

I think the point the original author was making is that you absolutely can sell BTC to make a profit and not have to sell it all. Who knew? I know a lot of people for some strange reason either want to keep it all or sell it all. Uhh guys, you can do both. Just change your expectations. Don't just go ""omg all my BTC is worth a $30,000 car time to cash out"" instead go ""if I sell 10% of my coin, I could buy this high-end computer. or better yet, put it into more stable traditional investments""

&#x200B;

TLDR;

You don't have to sell it all in order to make a return on your investment, especially if you have a plan in advance to control your future irrational self based on your risk/reward comfort.";3;0;False;mokahless;fgoc5g5;How to sell your bitcoin and never sell your bitcoin- an example;eza5jc;https://i.redd.it/cwc4ffds54f41.jpg

The handful of usernames employed by Saint Bitts LLC to sybil attack rbitcoin on behalf of the corporations behind the NY and HK 'agreements' in their failed takeover of Bitcoin attempt, were banned for boring the shit out of the rest of us with their sad and pathetic pleas for a dEbAtE - when the whole point of the OPEN SOURCE AND DECENTRALIZED bitcoin protocol is that voting is done by individuals choosing which software to run.

People with skin in the game (users) did some math on their calculators and realized that just increasing the block size would empower these corporations, not US - the users, and voted NOT to take part in running the closed source software or (even worse) in the segwit X2 fiasco.

There is no need for debate. There is no one IN CHARGE up there to appeal to - to debate with.

The corporations failed, got all butthurt, then forked off.

They still carry on as if 'CORE' is some kind of top down governing body that CAN make decisions on behalf of Bitcoin.

The few users who can't wrap their heads around decentralized open source development, nakamoto consensus or leaderless governance, naturally gravitated towards bcash (either of them) because they simply NEEDED or could not imagine not having someone IN CHARGE. So now they have to constantly debate, appeal to their authority, or choose their bosses to side with - jihan/roger or faketoshi/calvin.

Yup, this post is meant to inform users of this important change in policy and the implications.

I'll edit my post to clarify that the source code is available if it ever happens... For now Ver has been contacted multiple times about releasing the source code and once pointed people to the empty archives pretending the source code was there. So there is a clear communication problem at the very least.

The last 5.x version from the new repository dates from October 2019, if adding the source code was a temporary issue and/or a real concern I'd have expected it to have been solved in less than 4 months.

"You're correct, well can't say for the 80% figure, but let's say a vast majority are not knowledgeable/care enough and just trust the developers, app distribution platforms, etc.

A small fraction will verify signatures/hashes, which isn't bad per se but is not really doing anything else but trust the source of the comparison signature/hash which usually is a central authority (the developers).

And an even smaller fraction reviews/compile from source. This last option is the most trustless it gets as far as I know (provided your compiling tool-chain isn't compromised too... yeah it goes this deep... actually deeper if you consider that the hardware used could be compromised too 😅).

There's a way to verify binaries/compilation among more than a single central entity and mitigate this problem (dilute the trust) with software that have [reproducible builds](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/reproducible-builds/) (like Bitcoin Core, [see at the bottom](https://bitcoincore.org/en/download/)).

I don't think you'll find non-custodial wallets that allow you to buy Bitcoin directly to your wallet in the same app. But you can always use Coinbase (Pro preferably) since that's what you already use and move your coins straight away to your personal non-custodial wallet when you're done trading.

"I'm honored, thank you for the compliment

I think as long as you have your plan going into it and you make sure to stick to it you will be fine. 

The price of Bitcoin is not linear, and it's worthwhile to look at the history of it to see patterns, which may or may not hold up but it's better than not. 

Seems like the highest peaks come through about 500 something days after the halving. If you're planning on taking profits, end of 2021 is probably the best time you can preplan to take profits. It might even be possible to rebuy back to your original amount after it crashes from there... Again, if things pan out similarly to previous times. 

If this isn't practical to wait til then I'd say just have your benchmarks preset. Like, I will sell 10% at this price point, and so forth. Or whatever percentages. 

Just make sure to never for any reason fully exit bitcoin hodling. Keep something to keep you in it.

"For buying or selling bitcoin using fiat I prefer to use P2P trading exchanges. The ones I prefer are those that are both Non-custodial and No-KYC as well.

There are just a few of these,.... HodlHodl, LocalCryptos, Bisq, and some outliers, such as OpenBazaar.   LocalCoinSwap is both No-KYC and non-custodial for ETH and for ERC-20 tokens, but they are not (yet) non-custodial for trading bitcoin.  AgoraDesk is No-KYC as well, but they are a custodial wallet.

If you place the ad to buy on a P2P exchange, you then set the price at which you are willing to pay (e.g., 2% below spot).  If I need coins more promptly and can't wait for a seller to take my offer, there usually are multiple seller ads specifying a payment method that works (e.g., cash deposited in the seller's bank account) -- where the price is reasonable as well (sometimes, but not always).   In a pinch, I've used Bitcoin ATMs, ... but the fees with that method tend to run from high to obscenely high.

My bank (in the U.S.) doesn't work with Zelle, otherwise that would probably be my preferred payment method when buying, and possibly for when I am selling as well.

To get anywhere near that point, first fiat must be accommodated while crypto is adopted. Crypto is volatile and dangerous to hold for many businesses, hence BitPay’s payment gateway solution shielding from that danger. For now, the goal should be crypto adoption, you can’t go straight to crypto only without mass adoption first.

My point isn’t that these are likely, but that it’s necessary to discount them by mechanisms outside of the blockchain.
