The energy to secure Bitcoin will always be miniscule to the services it replaces. How much energy do banks use? And that's just one sector.

Bitcoin essentially turns energy into a tradable commodity. Which will give it a market value.. Which will make clean energy near-free. Which kills fossil fuels.

Bitcoin is the best thing to happen to energy conservation since Nikola Tesla. When he created alternating current or AC he intended for every person to have free electricity. Direct current Thomas Edison is the worst thing to happen to energy conservation and is responsible for millions of deaths do to his business practices. When Tesla broght AC to the USA he helped build the fucking Hoover Dam's electric generator thinking it would be enough energy at the time to power a big part of the East coast.

"There is an organisation with the name ""Bitcoin Foundation"", but they don't speak for Bitcoin any more than you or I do.

Bitcoin development is openly discussed in many places like mailing lists and chat platforms.  It's an open standard that anyone can implement (in open or closed source software) with whatever rules or technologies they choose.

The Bitcoin Core reference platform is an open source project that anyone can contribute to.  The maintainers tend to be relatively cautious about not merging any technology changes until there is a strong consensus in the many discussions.  That doesn't stop anyone else implementing it before them of course.

Schnorr and Taproot have a variety of different ways they could be implemented, which would be incompatible with each other, so it doesn't make a lot of sense for anyone to implement it before the details have been discussed at length.

"> The way I see it, now that the crypto is in my wallet and my possession, I'm the one who pays taxes on any capital gains in the future.

The IRS may disagree.  When u/momsbf sent you the BTC, only then did you take possession of it.  At the time of transfer u/momsbf is responsible for the gains/losses realized from the time of purchase to the time of transfer.  And after those have been calculated then the gift tax can be calculated secondarily.

"Technically bound to the maximum distribution of satoshis in dust UTXOs (without a fork to subdivide the satoshi in UTXOs) but I'll agree that's it's unbounded for all intents and purposes.

I just don't see why this is an issue since the rate of growth is approximately linear with total usage.  The chain itself also grows forever and is unbounded.  I don't see a problem with that either.  Essentially anything that isn't either exponential or involving ""very large numbers"" really isn't all that concerning.

I can imagine this being a problem in a scenario where the block size is unlimited and literally any number of transactions could be written to a block.  But since there is a block size limit, that also means in practical terms there is a limit to the number of new UTXOs that can be created in any given timeframe (in reality it's quite variable given the number of different things that can alter the size a transaction; but it does have a hard limit).  You can essentially guarantee that UTXO bloat won't grow by larger than this limit (and will almost always be much smaller) per block.

Can you justify your concern about it with some numbers rather than just a vague feeling about unbounded growth being a problem?";1;0;False;dalebewan;ffwhzi5;Discussion: Lost Bitcoins are a good thing, they increase Bitcoins Value;evjarh;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/evjarh/discussion_lost_bitcoins_are_a_good_thing_they/
"> That fix is worse than the ""problem"".

In support of u/igadjeed, I don't think they have to ""expire"" they could simply go into ""archive"".  Create a new OP code to restore archived TXNs, then to spend your archived UTXOs you craft two TXNs.  A restore and a spend.  More profit for the miners with less of and active UTXO footprint to maintain.  Miners don't keep archived TXNs in memory and reject any TXN that tries to reference one without first restoring it.

Wallets would be the ones that would know if your TXN is archived or not.  They would be the only ones keeping track.

"That fix is worse than the ""problem"".

UTXO bloat isn't a serious concern since it's relatively linear in growth.  As Bitcoin usage increases, absolutely the set of ""lost"" or ""stuck"" UTXOs will grow faster, but under normal circumstances it can't ever grow more than the total usage (i.e. that would mean that every new transaction results in a new ""lost"" UTXO).

That's also of course only talking about actual transactions written to the chain.  As Bitcoin adoption increases, UTXOs will less and less represent single transactions and more and more represent abstract concepts such as opening and closing second layer channels for multiple people and management of custodial accounts (yes they're bad, but people are creatures of habit and there'll likely be a long period of custodial usage until we get generational change allowing a more complete mindset change).

Basically, while I recognise UTXO bloat as being a negative of the UTXO model that Bitcoin uses, it's one that exists precisely to enable the positive aspects that make Bitcoin valuable **and** is not significant enough of a concern to consider the need for a solution.

Your ""fix"" would break my deep-freeze (very cold) storage strategy.  There are UTXOs there that haven't moved for over that number of blocks and access to them is deliberately inconvenient and time-consuming as well as having a non-zero cost associated with it.  Even worse, it ""exposes"" the coins until they're re-frozen which I'd obviously want to do immediately after the pointless ""keep alive"" transaction.  Doing all this multiple times such as once every couple of years (100000 blocks is approx 1.9 years) may reduce the security significantly as any surveillance on me might begin to piece together what's I'm doing.  Attempting to obfuscate my actions further would bring additional costs and time, as well as leaving the coins in a more vulnerable state for the time that I'm doing it.

Extending it to a longer timeframe would be somewhat better, but I'd contend that ANY timeframe is going to have negatives that don't justify the minor improvement of a reduction in UTXO bloat (especially as this minor improvement becomes less and less useful as the timeframe extends as well).";3;3;False;dalebewan;ffw9fwe;Discussion: Lost Bitcoins are a good thing, they increase Bitcoins Value;evjarh;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/evjarh/discussion_lost_bitcoins_are_a_good_thing_they/

"For everyone that isn't benefitting from the murdered person in some way, this is somewhat true.

However, as we're a social animal, it's reasonable to say that we prefer to live in societies where murder is not acceptable even with the benefits that it brings, since it opens each of us up to the possibility of being murdered by those who don't have any stake in our existence.

It's similar to the question of whether it should be okay for a hospital to murder a healthy person for their organs to save the lives of ten other people.  On the balance of things, sure, ten people live instead of only one; but the reality is that in a society like that, we'd never trust going to a hospital on the off-chance that we get murdered and harvested to save the lives of others and the net result would be less survival and lower quality of life.

This is the basis for the reason that the majority of libertarians subscribe to a non-aggression principle.  Although true selfishness and the use of violence may appear to provide an immediate individual benefit (and for a small minority may do so regardless), institutionalising this in the mindset actually leads to a worse situation for everyone.  We recognise the inherent right of individuals to their own liberty with the expectation that they recognise ours in return (the moment they don't, then aggression and violence for self-defence is perfectly acceptable).";1;0;False;dalebewan;ffw9ok5;Discussion: Lost Bitcoins are a good thing, they increase Bitcoins Value;evjarh;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/evjarh/discussion_lost_bitcoins_are_a_good_thing_they/

As I implied in a reply to /u/igadjeed already: if someone shows me numbers that evidence why/how UTXO bloat is a problem, I'm happy to change my view on it and then might give more attention to proposals for a solution; but right now it looks like a non-issue from my perspective.

"There have only been two halvings so far and their effects have been largely masked/ clouded by the immaturity of the BTC market as well as other outside factors that have influenced the price. Basically, two muddy data points aren’t enough to accurately predict what might happen in future halvings. 

Having said that, cutting the block reward by half absolutely affects the price because miners pay their utility and operations costs in fiat. This means that they have to unload BTC into the market in order to stay competitive. 

Some say that the halving has already been priced into the currently market value of BTC but I’m inclined to disagree because the really economic pressure has yet to be seen. 

Instead of looking at this upcoming halving, try to imagine what the value of BTC will be 3 or 4 halvings from now. Miners will be paying tens of thousands of dollars for the potential reward of mere fractions of a bitcoin.

This graph does not say what you think it says. Fiat money was never meant to hold on to it. If you had any assets which you necessarily had to hold for a 100 years, you would never hold them in USD, no one ever said you should do it in USD, the central bank does not say you should do it in USD. You invest them. USD is a    CURRENCY  ...CURRENCY, don't you get it? Not store of value? Not an investment? Its function is not to retain value, its function is to be a stable enough value on short-term so that people can used it for their CURRENT account and operations, so that they know how much value they will receive, so that its price is predictable (about 2% inflation target per year, and stable throughout the year). WTF does this have to do with bitcoin or economy in general? Who in the mainstream economy has ever said to you that a fiat currency should keep its value??? Can you educate yourselves for like 60 minutes on the topic?Also most people that complain about this don't have any money to speak of...

"USA.  I can't even use the exchanges I was using before anymore.

I initially used Circle, which was super simple.  But then they totally imploded, and closed all of it down.  Then I moved to CEX.io, but then my credit card started saying that using an exchange was a ""cash advance"" which has super high fees (in addition to the super high fees that the exchange was applying).  And then CEX deleted my account because the state I'd originally joined from changed their laws and the exchange no longer wanted to do business there, and when I tried to change my state to the one I was actually in, it wouldn't let me.

There might be new apps that let me use my credit card, though I don't know, and I don't want to use my phone for banking at all, really.  (Easier to steal/hack and get into my accounts.)

So now I use Libertyx and walk a mile or two to one of the local stores that has a cash/debit option for buying Bitcoin directly from the cashier.  It would be fast if I lived nearby, and they were open 24 hours, but they don't open until 10/11am, and they are fairly far away.  So no instant purchases for me anymore.  Which is fine.

"The value depends on  

*    the Bitcoin value of liquid Bitcoin  
*    the average fiat transaction value  
*    the average buy-spend-sell cycle time  
*    the average number of transactions in that cycle time  

The liquid amount is the total supply, less the lost coins, less the coins hoarded by bagholders desperately hoping for a new speculation bubble  

The buy-spend-sell cycle recognizes that spenders and merchants are not hoarders. The buyer acquires enough Bitcoin for a purchase, spends it immediately, then the merchant sells the Bitcoin for fiat immediately  

Here are some arbitrary numbers, for the purpose of showing how the calculation works  

Amount of liquid Bitcoin: 10 million  
Average fiat transaction value: $100  
Average buy-spend-sell cycle time: 1 day  
Average transaction volume (per 1 day): 100,000  

With these numbers:  

*   daily fiat transaction value is $10,000,000  
*   daily Bitcoin transaction value is the liquid amount, which is 10,000,000 Bitcoin

The Bitcoin fiat value is therefore $1

"If you create a transaction with a future value **locktime** then the transaction cannot be broadcast until after that block height is passed. It can be done either by block height or by unix time value (integer). Another transaction with lower lock time can be broadcast first and will prevent the latter one (due to that would be a double spend of same outputs). Either way it's a normal private key or wallet. Most wallets don't have facility for setting an arbitrary locktime though I have written an Electrum plugin that allows this when creating a transaction. So that's one way.

Another way is to create a special **CLTV** (CheckLockTimeVerify) address. This is a p2sh (pay to script hash) type address (similar to segwit or multisig) that only allows spending when the block height / time is above a set value in the script. In this case any btc sent there are locked in that address. I worked on a plugin for this also for Electurm but currently have not had success getting the signing to work properly - so it's stalled until I get more time to finish it. In this type of address you cannot spend the btc in any way before the lock time. It is possible to make a script that allows alternate spend types but I'm not aware of any wallet/tool for that.

The only other wallet I currently know of for **CLTV** that is somewhat easy to use (not for noobs at all) is [coinb.in](https://coinb.in/#newTimeLocked). It's actually pretty easy but care is needed. It is not compatible with any other wallets and you must be careful to save the redeem script value and private key (or create a full spend signed transaction and save that for later broadcast). With this be sure to do a test run to make sure you understand it. I did that and it worked well and is easy but is a bit confusing first time and exactly the kind of thing you may later forget how to spend from (unless you create a signed tx that's simple as pie to broadcast at later time). Not noob friendly. I wrote up a step by step some months ago and will edit this with a link if I find it again.

"I think mining at a loss is underrated.

Mining at a loss helps distribute the hash power among more entities, making the system more decentralized.

It's a kind of charity, in order to help make the entire network more secure for each other.

I wish that everyone had an extremely efficient miner, and spared a few bucks in electricity every month, in order to achieve greater mining decentralization. It may not be profitable, but if a million HODLers spent 10% of their profits back into mining-at-a-loss, I think it's an overall good thing and would have a pretty big impact on the system.

In fact, if there were a million people mining at a loss, it would curb some of the bigger miners (corporate ones, \*ahem\* china) to possibly become unprofitable. This means they might even cease operations, which means even greater decentralization. This, in turn, allows people mining-at-a-loss to start actually lose less, and less.

We don't really need big mining operations securing the network on our behalf and reaping profits. A large enough, collective, distributed, decentralized network of volunteer (sacrificial) miners could potentially have a significant impact on the profitability of centralized mining, making it far less centralized.";26;2;False;anon517;ffvbwpw;Dear Peasants: Mining Bitcoin at a loss, IS OK.

Yessir. It's only a matter of time before a company starts selling Bitcoin heaters. Essentially, space heaters that mine Bitcoin. The trick will be doing this in a fashion that will muffle/eliminate the noise. I heat portions of my home with different machines.

I'm currently mining cryptonote coins with my 7 GPUs, I promptly acquire BTC with them. because of the downturn, it just would pay for the electricity if I had also sold the BTC but I keep them, but I'm also heating the house. In a sense, I'm buying BTC with my electricity bill. During winter, I'll continue to mine even at 75% electricity return, kind of subsidized heating at that point.

Bitcoin is not anonymous. Hardware wallets do not add privacy. You CANNOT transfer bitcoins to a bank account. You can sell bitcoin. Then transfer fiat. Some banks don't like bitcoin exchanges and will red flag transfers. Other banks don't. Certain banks I use do not complain about any transfers, even if they flag them silently.

FTFY, but yes.  Some users have made claims that certain banks flag their accounts coming out of exchanges.  I don't know if it's all FUD or if its legit.  Best to simply ask your bank and get something in writing and printed about what ""prohibited"" activities are.  The ""printing"" part is important.  TOS online can change at any point in time and may be applied retroactively.

There are some banks who actively invest in Bitcoin and as such are less likely to care about using it.

There is a threshold over what used to be, don't know if it still is, $9,999 the bank reports the deposit to the IRS. Below that it should not be any different then any other ACH deposit. However, how do you transfer virtual currency to your bank? You have to convert it to cash first. In other words a 3rd party some of which are very reputable such as gemini. If you choose a non SEC insured brokerage that may raise the flag. The bank may in fact not accept the deposit really.

What I’m doing at the moment is stocking up on more coin whenever the price dips a couple of percent. In any case, I would recommend buying a certain amount of bitcoin each month until the halving comes. That way you get cheap prices before the price really starts blowing up, although it might start taking off prior to the halving as people buy in anticipation. Imo, the period were in right now is a great time to buy as you can get in before all the speculators start buying and driving up the price. Just my $0.02, there’s probably more opportune ways to maximize your profit but it’s just difficult to time the market like that.;7;1;False;aleden28281;ffvtc67;To the moon;eve0f8;https://i.redd.it/8n64shnnvld41.jpg

You don't understand how bitcoin works. If it crashes to a low price you like it means miners will leave and if they do it will not be secure against 51% attacks. A coin that can be attacked at any time is.. well... bcash. You don't even need to wait to 2k. You can buy bcash 1 for 378 and bcash 2 for 295 right now. Go buy them because you clearly DGAF about coin's actual viability.;-3;2;False;jenny82ishere;ffv4h5u;To the moon;eve0f8;https://i.redd.it/8n64shnnvld41.jpg

Yes it absolutely does. Price cannot drop below a threshold and with it hashrate cannot drop below a threshold. Yes I remember $200. Hashrate was different then. Hashrate cannot drop below 50 exa today. If it does that means there's 60 exa in hardware not running and can be turned on to mess with exchange deposits and such.

If history repeat's itself you need to remember that there is a bit of lag between the halvening and the actual price jump. This could take as long as a year (Jan 2021). So no matter what, hodl lol. Also I wonder what happens this time since usually it more then double's it's previous ath. That would land it at like 40k+ and 55k would be a trillion dollar market cap.

2, miner incentives. They have huge blocks and barely any transactions. At some point miners will only get paid via transaction fees, when block reward dwindles down. In their attempt to make bcash fees really low and block limit really big the centralized bcash team authority has basically fucked their own miners.

Yes you are, and maybe you're genuinely asking so I'll give you the benefit of the doubt.

"Here's a short breakdown from a 2013 hodler:

During the split time of Bcash forking off BTC there was a lot of heated tensions that called for the end of BTC as it could no longer scale which was untrue as SegWit was a simple solution. Bitcoin Cash headed by Roger Ver and Jihan Wu was supposed to be the Ultimate BTC which they called Operation Dragon Slayer. Jihan Wu who you don't even hear about anymore had great motive to damage Bitcoin and promote Bcash which they could control through the Ant Miner pool which of course Jihan controlled. Roger's part in taking Bitcoin.com and the Bitcoin twitter handle tricked many into thinking Bitcoin cash superior when it was a fork that did not have the history or network strength that Bitcoin had.

Going down the line a little later the Bcash community split again due to Craig Wright who Roger Ver vouched for decided to make his own Bcash coin which he thought he could control and claim to be the real 'Satoshi'. Nowadays Craig is in huge legal battles in court and is losing in that arena. Jihan Wu used to tweet but he has not since bcash started losing market value. Roger just shills on r/btc about bcash but its all the same bots/shills who hang around that subreddit.

"Transactions with $50 fees did not take days. That's the non-secret to the whole thing - those who pay high tx fees can get their transaction in at any time. Segwit happened to alleviate some of that. It's not THE solution, more like an accounting trick.

Bcash reverting back to original protocol is bullshit and a lie. Does it use addresses instead of IP? Not original protocol. Does it have multisig address type? Not original protocol. Does it destroy long term mining incentives to temporarily appease ""cheap fees"" adherents? That's also not original protocol which accounts for miners eventually subsisting on fees alone. You are missing a whole lot. All bcash variants are a scam. Would you even know about them if they named their coins RogerCoin and CalvinCoin? You only heard of them because they are squatting on bitcoin name and riding bitcoin's coat tails.

If you want fast and cheap there are many options that actually work. Coins with cheap fees that are better than bcash. Look at Dash. It is pretty fast with cheap tx, and it works perfectly. Unfortunately they have a community that is so positive all the time that it makes them toxic. Another is digibyte coin. Stupidly fast.

">We have great infrastructure for transporting electricity

That's not universally true. Google electricity curtailment 

Even the Netherlands, one of the most advanced countries on earth, has serious curtailment problems due to too much renewable energy coming online.

Bitcoin miners just happen to be the only ones mobile enough to go to where the energy is stranded. any other industry takes years to build up, bitcoin miners can be up and running in a matter of weeks. That in itself is a unique selling point for bitcoin.

On top of that, The link below shows how bitcoin mining can actually reduce the footprint.

"**Pumped-storage hydroelectricity**

Pumped-storage hydroelectricity (PSH), or pumped hydroelectric energy storage (PHES), is a type of hydroelectric energy storage used by electric power systems for load balancing.  The method stores energy in the form of gravitational potential energy of water, pumped from a lower elevation reservoir to a higher elevation. Low-cost surplus off-peak electric power is typically used to run the pumps. During periods of high electrical demand, the stored water is released through turbines to produce electric power.

I don’t know how you would do a legit controlled study on the sources and uses of energy consumption in crypto, but thinking internet polls don’t fall prey to all kinds of bias from a statistical standpoint is silly.  it’s irrelevant and unusable data, certainly wouldn’t be good enough to make any kind of claim without a massive (like 50% or more) margin of error. Also I don’t think the point of “no green mining”  is not that you get your energy from green sources, it’s that you are using a computer and energy to basically calculate a meaningless calculation all day.

"**Mathematical proof**

A mathematical proof is an inferential argument for a mathematical statement, showing that the stated assumptions logically guarantee the conclusion. The argument may use other previously established statements, such as theorems; but every proof can, in principle, be constructed using only certain basic or original assumptions known as axioms, along with the accepted rules of inference. Proofs are examples of exhaustive deductive reasoning which establish logical certainty, to be distinguished from empirical arguments or non-exhaustive inductive reasoning which establish ""reasonable expectation"". Presenting many cases in which the statement holds is not enough for a proof, which must demonstrate that the statement is true in all possible cases.

"Been 100% in BTC for half a decade already.

The best part is the FEELING of not taking part in THEIR bloodsoaked fiat scam.

I turn my meagre retirement income into BTC immediately, and make almost all of my payments in BTC, now mostly on LN.

Granted, I am a retiree (so have little income and even less expenses) and have avoided giving any money to corporations for many years already (excluding airlines).

It took a while to set up my regular payment receivers (landlord, groceries, gas station/mechanic, pub, travel agent, farmers market) to accept BTC and then on LN, but I am there now.

"It really depends on ""how much"" they're living paycheck to paycheck and how much buffer they have.

I don't live from paycheck to paycheck anymore but like almost everyone that isn't born with a silver spoon in their mouth, that was my reality for most of my life.  I also hold zero fiat, so I'm familiar with how the value fluctuations influence my relative worth.

The biggest thing I note is that value fluctuations affect traders far more than they affect me.  Since the overall trend is up and downwards trends don't tend to sustain themselves all that long, if you have enough buffer to survive a couple of paychecks at half-pay (generally the worst it'll ever drop between two consecutive paychecks) then it's really not a big problem, since you'll also experience the ability to save more on the (more common) situation of your received income being worth more than it was when you earned it, and use this to (at least) rebuild the buffer that you lost during the down times.";1;0;False;dalebewan;ffw874m;Successfully moving to an entire crypto lifestyle?;evahba;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/evahba/successfully_moving_to_an_entire_crypto_lifestyle/

"Not only is it entirely possible, but there are a couple of very strong models that predict it. See the [Stock to Flow](https://medium.com/@100trillionUSD/modeling-bitcoins-value-with-scarcity-91fa0fc03e25) and [Power Law](https://medium.com/coinmonks/bitcoins-natural-long-term-power-law-corridor-of-growth-649d0e9b3c94) growth models. Bitcoin's halving process totally transforms how valuation works.

Secondly, the Forex market (which I think is the scale of market that cryptocurrency will eventually grow to match) has a *daily* volume of *5 trillion.* And that's primarily financial institutions making trades-- it's a market that has only really become accessible to the retail trader in the last 20 years or so.

Right now, most people heard a lot about Bitcoin when it was approaching 20k and then were told shortly there after in numerous ways that the bubble had burst, Bitcoin is dead, it'll never go that high again, it was a Ponzi scheme, etc.

The next time the general public starts thinking about Bitcoin, it'll be because it has once again breached 20k and is screaming up to 100k.

When the bubble eventually pops once more and lands above 20k, being told 'Bitcoin is dead, it'll never grow past 100k again, it's a dead project', etc. etc. won't work anymore, because people will remember hearing that same thing back when it reached 20k the first time.

"I knew it was a waste of time trying to educate stupid people. Any guy worth his salt in Crypto can tell you (and many of them did, repeatedly) not to store crypto on your phone because it's the easiest way to lose your money. Only a fucking moron would carry around his considerable crypto investments in his pocket. Maybe you didn't see, but the poster mentioned he bought $30K of crypto (very uninspired to tell us). You also failed to provide any counter-arguments to most of my observations , and I'm pretty sure you don't work in digital security. What was my first clue? Well, you recommended a mobile wallet. What was my second clue? If you actually did work in digital security, you would have told me directly instead of slightly implying it. Your only defense is ""that shit's impossible in the real world"". No, it's fucking not, I can do it with a laptop and wireless sniffer at any wireless spot. All I have to do is identify the smartphone model, which is usually the username they use for wireless and bluetooth, then use the key to gain backdoor access to his phone. The backdoor access keys are readily and freely available on the internet, but of course you won't find them on Google, since Google is the developer of Android. Just because you're too dumb to find them doesn't mean hackers are too. Get educated or shut the fuck up about things you don't know jack shit about if you don't want to look stupid.

They are but they gotta keep the price low. Take a depth chart from an exchange, for example coinbase. You would only need about $500k to make the price junp up by about $50 a coin. (Not sure after that because that's where the chart ends). Imagine investing millions and just purchasing. Your first coin would be alot cheaper then your second and so on. Kinda offsetting your gains. But if you buy it slowly you can not be a huge impact on the price while you slowly build wealth. The problem is when the price surges and you try and dump them you dump them fully knowing you are going to saturate the market and drive the price down to a lower price where you can buy them back and keep the difference.

a key detail here is that your wallet uses more than one bitcoin address. every time you receive a payment, your wallet generates a new address for that specific payment. the bitcoin in your wallet is actually spread out over many addresses. that’s why other commenters are saying you’d import your public key into the app. by doing that, the app could track all the addresses associated with your wallet, rather than only looking at a single address.;1;0;False;bitcoinisagoodthing;ffv15f8;Daily Discussion, January 28, 2020;ev23bq;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ev23bq/daily_discussion_january_28_2020/
"No, if someone has your seed, they have your Bitcoin. The passphrase allows access to wallets while using thr Trezor device, so if they steal the Trezor they can't access your wallets without the passphrase. So the passphrase feature is still a really good idea. I think you can also set up different passphrases for different wallets so if someone is robbing you and tells you to open the Trezor and send all your BTC you can use your ""under duress"" passphrase and access a wallet with a very small amount and the attacker will be unaware of the larger amount.

Hello,

Thank you for contacting us.

Currently, the Blockchain Wallet generates legacy (P2PKH) receiving addresses, as you mentioned. However, you can use your Blockchain Wallet to send to P2SH-P2WPKH. Sending to bech32 addresses is not yet fully supported in the Blockchain Wallet.

If you attempt to send to an address of an unsupported type, your wallet will give you an ""invalid address"" warning.

Please let me know if you have any additional questions or if I can be of any further assistance. Thank you for choosing the Blockchain Wallet!

Would you say that Catholicism (eg. the pope) supports freedom and creativity? I also can't think of a single religion, besides Christianity kinda, that supports voluntaryism, so by that logic no religious person (belonging to the main 4 or 5 religions) can be a leftist?

> Conservative religions aim to protect something (physical) from being harmed/changed

Which religion wouldn't aim to protect people from being harmed? And what changes do religions forbid, besides those forbidden by the architect and creator of everything himself? Are you suggesting that obeying the supreme being of the universe is a ""right"" rather than ""left"" thing to do?

> So it's silly to say that liberals don't try to avoid harm, or that conservatives never want to playfully create

Hence why your criteria are useless.

">Hence why your criteria are useless.

Not at all.  Just because I have a somewhat masculine brain and hormones doesn't mean I'm not a female, in general.  Just because some humans are shorter than me doesn't mean I'm not short.  Just because it's sometimes light at night, or dark during the day (especially near the poles of the planet) doesn't mean we don't talk about day vs. night time.  We use categories at all levels, from very general to very detailed.  Each level is useful for something

And it doesn't matter how many others use a term in an arbitrary, or even totally illogical way, or are simply confused, or are actively deceptive, when it comes to how we choose to use it.  I prefer to be logical and use literal meanings, to help keep things clear and understandable.  But you're free to use whatever approach you want.

Basically, it comes down to who gets to make the decisions (first dimension, top-down/totalitarian vs bottom-up/libertarian), and whether the goal is to protect the old (conservative/right) or support growth/change/freedom of expression (liberal/left).

Democratic systems are in the center (vertically), since they are fully both bottom-up and top-down, and they can be either liberal or conservative.

Totalitarian systems can be either liberal (hyper maternalistic, wanting you to grow and be creative to some extent, but not trusting you to make your own decisions) or conservative (hyper paternalistic, wanting you to be just like them, and using force to keep you predictable and ""safe"").

Libertarian systems can be either liberal (fully supporting your freedom to make your own rules and be as creative as you like, but not trying to interfere with your life in any way, so you're very independent) or conservative (believing in one's own freedom, but not being super sure about ""those other people"" who are weird and different and possibly ""dangerous"" to one's own personal beliefs.

As far as religion goes, note that the word simply means to ""bind together"".  The word shares a Latin root with ligature and ligament, with ligature meaning the binding of pages into a book, and ligaments being the things that bind muscles and bones together.  So a religion in the most general and literal sense is a group of individuals bound together by a shared belief that ""this is how things are/should be"".  So a group of teenagers playing an MMORP game for a long time together will come up with their own rituals, rules, and preferences that keeps them intact as a group.  That would be a more casual religion.  While something like Buddhism, Catholicism, pagan/native traditions, Judaism, and Hinduism would be more global ideologies that have lasted for centuries or millennia. 

Each religion can be located in either the extremes of either of those two dimensions, or in the center.  For example Buddhism is liberal libertarian.  Catholicism is conservative totalitarian. Hinduism might be conservative libertarian.  And (non-orthodox) Judaism is more centrist.  While academia/technocracy is more liberal totalitarian. (Here is the ""merit-based"" system you were asking about, where some folks have more control than others, and the rules are highly centralized, but there is some encouragement of creativity. This is where Bitcoin is, most accurately, I'd say.).";1;0;False;Turil;ffwqh9j;"Wikipedia Guidance for Editors: ""Cryptos and bitcoins and blockchains, oh no!""";eum58w;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Signpost/2020-01-27/In_focus

"**Tulip mania**

Tulip mania (Dutch: tulpenmanie) was a period in the Dutch Golden Age during which contract prices for some bulbs of the recently introduced and fashionable tulip reached extraordinarily high levels and then dramatically collapsed in February 1637. It is generally considered the first recorded speculative bubble. In many ways, the tulip mania was more of a hitherto unknown socio-economic phenomenon than a significant economic crisis. Historically, it had no critical influence on the prosperity of the Dutch Republic, the world's leading economic and financial power in the 17th century.

actually they do choose the 'secret' - the secret is just the block header which includes a nonce. They iterate the nonce, hash the block header and then check the resulting hash to see if it is < the current target (difficulty). If it isn't, they try again with another nonce. The miner does always have the block header and nonce.. it's just that not every nonce will produce a hash with a low enough numerical value.;1;0;False;rtherge;ffxy2ky;Who creates the proof of work problems that the miners solve?;evtxbn;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/evtxbn/who_creates_the_proof_of_work_problems_that_the/
"It’s simpler than that, they’re just taking data from the previous block (block header etc) and running the SHA256 algorithm with that data. One value changes, which is called the nonce, and each ‘value change’ is called a hash. They are seeking to create a nonce + previous block data which returns a hashed product with a certain number of zeroes at the beginning (‘leading zeroes’). Whoever does that first posts their solution, the hashed data plus the nonce, to all the nodes in the network. If it obeys the rules (such as having the correct number of zeroes), then it is accepted. First to publish to nodes wins.

The transactions in that block are then added to the blockchain. That block’s header etc is then used to mine another block. The first transaction in a block is a ‘coinbase reward’, which is nothing to do with the exchange. It’s a transaction from nowhere to the miner’s wallet. 

That’s about as simple as I can make it, and skips a lot of stuff. Tl;dr nobody ‘makes problems’ that get solved and then hands out bitcoin.

Edit: the number of leading zeroes required is self regulated by the protocol in accordance with the hash rate (how many total hashed per second) to keep blocks produced roughly every ten minutes. The hash rate is determined by how much faster or slower than ten minutes recent blocks have been created.";1;0;False;BeTeeC;ffxyab0;Who creates the proof of work problems that the miners solve?;evtxbn;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/evtxbn/who_creates_the_proof_of_work_problems_that_the/
"Details are here:

Roughly:

* people spend Bitcoin, their wallets broadcast 'transactions'
* miners listen for those transactions and keep a list of them
* each miner creates a 'block' of new transactions (a few thousand transactions)
* the  miner adds a timestamp, the 'id number' of the previous block (no  matter who mined it), and then guesses a 'lucky number' and adds that to  his new block
* the miner runs his new block through a **cryptographic hash function**, which  'crunches' the block down from millions of ones and zeroes into a string of just 256 ones and zeroes
* the  256 bits represent a whole number (0, 1, 2, ..); if that number is less  than the current difficulty target, the miner 'wins' -- that miner has  'solved the math problem'
* typically,  the result of the hash function is greater than the target; the miner  updates the timestamp, guesses another 'lucky number' then tries again,  and again...
* the  target number is low enough that it takes all the miners in the world  working as fast as they can about ten minutes (on average) until one of  them gets lucky and 'wins'";1;0;False;Mark_Bear;ffxyl3p;Who creates the proof of work problems that the miners solve?;evtxbn;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/evtxbn/who_creates_the_proof_of_work_problems_that_the/

"You know you can like...check, right?

BTC Has existed for like 3900 days give or take, lets start Jan 1st, 2010.

So 3681 Days. 

Of that time, only 215 days would it have been better to do a monthly DCA compared to the equivalent Lump sum (Some days in very late 2017 and some days in 2018 and only a few in 2019) at all other times, Lump sum would have been better.   
So 215 out of 3681 is 5.8%, so you've got 94.2% where Lump Sum is better. 

A quick look at a chart should lead you to that conclusion, but you can price check each of those days to be accurate.   
A general rule of thumb is just 'how many days were above current price?'  
But more complicated is 'how many days were both above current price and had a long term decline following it?' those will allow you to eyeball it. But to be totally accurate you can just check each day.

"That's people's misunderstanding of what DCA is, yes.

just ""I bought $25 a week because i literally couldn't afford to do more"" isn't DCA'ing. It's just buying when you could afford to. 

DCA is the active strategy of splitting a purchase to 'average in' at intentionally difference prices. 

In the Case of this OP's question, the question is very clear, he has a lump sum to invest now. Should he Buy, not buy, or DCA it?   


  
If someone Cannot afford to lump sum buy, Don't say 'DCA is Better' because it's not... it may simply be a financial necessity to buy in smaller installments over time, but it is Not better, it's not a 'good strategy' it's a not 'a good way to avoid price fluctuations' or a way to 'diversify risk' any other nonsense a bunch of grifters pitch it as  


Which strategy is financially, mathematically better? Lump Sum is 92% of the time better. (Someone points out if you start at BTC's origin it's actually over 94%)

If you MUST buy in installment, well, life is tough, but don't tell people it's better, and certainly people should not be telling a person who is asking about a lump sum purchase to not do that and DCA instead.";4;0;False;EnderSword;ffxzjxc;Buying bitcoin right now?;evren1;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/evren1/buying_bitcoin_right_now/

"Yes, if you have a sum of money today, and it sounds like you do, then breaking it into smaller buys is almost always mathematically wrong on any asset with a a positive expected return. 

If you think an asset is going up, then you think there's greater than a 50% chance it will rise from the point it is now.

So why would you then take an action predicated on it dropping? 

If you have say $10,000 today and you think it will rise, buy it. 

If you instead had $10,000 and decided to instead split your purchase into 4 parts and buy monthly instead, but you believe the price is increasing, then there's a good chance your 2nd, 3rd and 4th purchase will be at a worse price.

&#x200B;

Think of it like betting on a football game.  You think the Chiefs will win the Superbowl.. 

So bet on them. 

You would not say you think they're going to win so you'll bet 25% at the start, 25% after the 1st quarter, 25% at half and 25% after the 3rd. 

If your belief was right, chances are very good you'll get much worse odds after the 1st, half and 3rd quarter because your team will be leading the game.

Doing DCA is simply betting that your bet is wrong, and the more 'installments' it's broken up into, the more likely that is to be a bad strategy. 

  
At any random point in BTC history, buying as a lump sum is better than having done monthly DCA installments 92% of the time.";3;1;False;EnderSword;ffxm030;Buying bitcoin right now?;evren1;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/evren1/buying_bitcoin_right_now/

"He simply doesn't like the idea of bitcoin winning in the long run. DCAing means mid-term getting comfortable with the idea of hodling and accumulating in the first place. In other words *believing* by heart in the power of bitcoin. And that's exactly how bitcoin will achieve victory.

You can test this by just pulling up a time line of BTC prices over the past 10 years, choose 10 to 30 Random dates.

">If I bought $100 a month for that year, or bought $1200 at once.

If you bought the 1200$ ""at once"", you're saying you buy right away at the beginning of that 12 months?  Because DCA tends to appeal to people who dont want to or cant afford to dump a huge lump sum up front.  But they can budget putting $25/week going forward.  

Looking at bitcoins history, its obvious that getting as much $$ in as early as possible would have the better results.   So a lump sum purchase up front would beat DCA most of the time.   But that isn't in everyone's budget. 

Yeah,  if you had DCA $10/week for the last 10 years you'd have invested $5,200 and you'd have a shit ton of bitcoin, and it was achievable and not very risky.  If you put all $5,200 in a lump sum ten years ago... you'd have a shit ton more BTC than DCA would allow you to accumulate.   But it would have been a huge risk, and having $5k to throw at a risky investment isn't in everyone's budget.";1;1;False;HitMePat;ffxy0d1;Buying bitcoin right now?;evren1;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/evren1/buying_bitcoin_right_now/

You can do that with any stock. It's specific to certain situations and DCA gives the most simple and blanketed purchase for beginners who don't know where the supports are of where any good places to buy are. And again, you haven't given any sources so using your logic I could say DCA outperforms lump purchases by 96.0274% according to studies by 5 different organizations. BTC is also up $100,000 and USD is worth 5% of what it was 2 months ago.;3;1;False;jeremy14444;ffxl7qj;Buying bitcoin right now?;evren1;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/evren1/buying_bitcoin_right_now/

"Yeah, exactly, you can use that tool to verify that lump sum is better than DCA. 

I actually did use that exact site when I was looking into the comparison at first. An unfortunately part of that site, it doesn't tell you how much actual BTC you had so you've got to calculate that yourself.

So for anyone trying to do this, pick some random date...Select 'On Specific Date'  Let's say March 3rd 2016, and look at monthly accumulation, lets say for 1 year.

So March 3rd, 2016 the price was $423.99

If I bought $100 a month for that year, or bought $1200 at once. 

So at the end of that, your 'DCA' approach would own 1.59 BTC, but your Lump sum approach would own 2.83 BTC  
So in this case Lump Sum was better.

So just do that for like 30 totally random dates, and on about 92% of dates, it will turn out the Lump sum was better.";2;1;False;EnderSword;ffxnuux;Buying bitcoin right now?;evren1;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/evren1/buying_bitcoin_right_now/

I suggest having a hardware wallet, like a trezor, or ledger.

Then take a couple pictures of the qr code on your phone... I suggest a couple pictures because one may be more focused than the next.

"Learn math, and science.  Lots of math, even if it's hard, it's worth it.  This will help you earn money when you get out of school.  

Don't skip breakfast, your brain needs glycogen (blood sugar, from the food you eat for breakfast).  You need your brain to be as smart as you can make it be.  

That means: Eat right.  Get enough sleep.  Exercise.  Learn math.  Read lots of books... make sure some are non-fiction.  

You can learn math -- it's actually mostly memorization via repetition.  If/when you get stuck, find somebody to help you: a teacher, a tutor, another student who gets A's in math without even trying.  Learning lots of math (and geometry, algebra, logic, trigonometry, calculus, etc.) strengthens your brain -- it makes you smart.  You're inheriting a world that won't need many ""dumb laborers,"" rather, it will need smart people.  Learning math will help you be one of the smart people who gets financially rewarded for being smart and knowing math, science, computer technology, physics, robotics, genetics, etc.";0;1;False;Mark_Bear;ffx5rmg;I’m 15 and want to invest in bitcoin;evpatx;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/evpatx/im_15_and_want_to_invest_in_bitcoin/

To add to this, information that is generally not an issue can reveal your identity given enough effort.  For example, if in one post I said that I lived in southern Ohio, in another I said that I was a 25 yo male, in a third I was celebrating my first son’s birth, and in another I was just fired.  Those could be enough information to pinpoint my identity, assuming that I’m truthful.  The US census actually has to deal with this issue seriously, because citizens have a right to privacy, but the census information can be used to find a specific person.  The census does this by fudging the numbers, but if you’re not gonna fudge your numbers, they can figure you out.;8;0;False;AdamF778899;ffxqaid;I finally own 10 Bitcoins !;evo8us;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/evo8us/i_finally_own_10_bitcoins/
"It is relatively easy to find most online identities and link them to real people. If your Bitcoins are on your home comp, however, 'hacking' is of very, very low risk. You'd have to download a specific virus or have sent your private key (or safe words) over email, which really you should never do. If you have 2FA and your coins are on exchange, you're pretty safe as well.

If you keep $100k of Bitcoin on exchange without 2FA, then announcing you have Bitcoin might lead to someone guessing your name and leaked password at all the sites, and hoping for the best, but that is the only realistic 'robbery' situation.

MANY MANY MANY will claim that announcing you have $100k of Bitcoin means people will track you down and wrench you to death - but this is false. There are TONS of rich people throughout the world, and they are not all constantly under threat of wrenching death - in fact many own a home that is over $100k or have cars worth about the same. So, as long as you are not an idiot, discussing Bitcoin over the internet is fine - Just don't download viruses, don't email your safe words, and do use 2FA, and you're about as equally safe as Szabo, Andreas, and so on - who haven't lost any Bitcoin due to violent death yet.

Actually, yes there is. You'll get your money back from insurance. Also, for the attacker, it's not at all trivial to anonymize and withdraw a huge amount of money from a bank account.

"Nobody ever really seems to think it is a big deal, but I agree with you.

Unless it is a throwaway account, you're always leaving breadcrumbs about your life.  Maybe post in the local city subreddit?  We talk about our hobbies and the things that interest us, it isn't beyond thinking that someone could figure it out.

10BTC is currently about $100k USD for something that actually can be beaten out of you, with nobody knowing you're even in trouble.  I'd have the same opinion if someone wandered around Tokyo with a suitcase full of cash.

There's absolutely no comparison to someone talking about the millions in investments that they have, because the baddies can't easily get at that stuff.  They'd have to deal with all the usual shit we hate about fiat withdrawal, and there's huge risks that the cops would get involved.

Then recall that we're all staring down the gullet of a new bull run (at least that's what everyone is hoping for) and that 10BTC may be worth far more.  Maybe $1M even, and if that's not motivation I don't know what is.";6;2;False;LickingCats;ffx6xgr;I finally own 10 Bitcoins !;evo8us;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/evo8us/i_finally_own_10_bitcoins/

"> If I paid with a $100 bill they wouldn't know if it was counterfeit until I was long gone.

People have to understand that this insanely improbable! You can't counterfeit a transaction! You cannot just say I pay this and that without submitting a *valid* transaction to the mempool! If a transaction is *invalid* it won't show as received. The only way to cheat is to actually do a fucking double spend while you're in the restaurant! This means that you have to have some insane mining rig available that will mine a block within a reasonable amount of time since your double spend attack.

Do you really believe that if this was easy, nobody would do it? It is next to fucking impossible if you look at the hash rate of bitcoin. Someone else will mine your restaurant payment before you will mine your double spend.

"> Are they being forced into this path?

Not a lawyer, but I've read the relevant laws in a couple of countries, and also a guidelines document provided to regulated exchanges by a government authority. The law does not require tainting. The law requires a risk management approach, monitoring all transactions and detecting any which could be money laundering or terrorism financing. The details of risk assessment are left to the exchange to design and implement. Registration as a money services business requires the business to write a description of the risk assessment process - but not in small detail  
The guidelines document appears to be an often-copied list of instructions written by the FBI a few years ago. Maintain a list of addresses known to be used for extortion and theft. Be suspicious of frequent IP address changes, especially if the IP addresses appear to indicate VPN use, or the IP address is in a different country to the customer. Be suspicious of transactions which have been mixed, using a list of addresses known to be used by the third-party mixing services. This was written some years before the Wasabi wallet made coinjoin P2P mixing more popular. The guidelines recommend that exchanges might benefit from using the services of one of the blockchain analysis companies - not compulsory, but a good idea because then the ""experts"" can supply a consistent list of tainted addresses to all their exchange clients  

Some recent discussions have revealed that chain analysis services now do more than simply taint criminal Bitcoin addresses. They provide a risk assessment rating automatically for each transaction  

Extrapolating from this old guidelines document to the current tainting behaviour, it appears that many exchanges have chosen the cheap and dirty option - pay chain analysis companies to do all their risk assessment. Recently one or more of the chain analysis services has been marking Wasabi coinjoin transactions as high risk for money laundering. This could be a simple case of overreach and incompetence, or it could be that a recent high-value, high-profile scam (Plus Token) was using Wasabi for laundering";4;0;False;igadjeed;ffxqdyb;More platforms banning BTC tainted by CoinJoin, even after multiple hops;evm064;https://twitter.com/ronaldmchodled/status/1222172084610027523

"“Not sure I’d call people who hoard cash ignorant”

Nobody should ever hold their wealth in “cash”. Firstly if someone is 100% risk adverse, there is a such thing as the risk free rate, this generally correlates at the minimum to the yield of US treasury bills. There are numerous ways to take advantage of the risk free rates such as buying t-bills, savings accounts, and hedging forward and futures contracts.

Moreover, however, and more to the point, all nonsystematic risk in equity investments can be easily diversified away leaving only the market risk. On the time horizon that any typical American should be investing for retirement in, the negative impact of any recession will still be significantly less than the negative impact of holding cash or simply collecting the risk free rate. Moreover, if an investors time horizon is less than the typical 35 years, there is a such thing as hedging against as much market risk as you would like by shorting S&P 500 futures to whatever degree of systematic risk you are comfortable with. I could go on and on about other investment strategies in fixed income and real estate asset classes but I’m sure you get the point. 

Those who hold cash, or even accept the risk free rate over a long time horizon are completely ignorant to our economic system and do not deserve financial success";0;1;False;notbourbonguy;ffxgvi5;Oops.;evhfrp;https://i.imgur.com/nzibUPy.png

Currency was historically always a store a value. When you work and save money in your 20's you should be able to spend that money in your 60's without losing value. Fiat forces you to spend it or risk losing it in investments. Fiat currency always rips wealth from the poor meanwhile the rich get richer. Fiat is why asset prices are sky high and housing is out of reach for even the middle class. People with wealth have to look for safe havens to retain the value so they buy up all the real estate, stocks, ect. Fiat is why there is a boom and bust cycle (aka business cycle) which destroys many people's wealth and allows the rich buy up more assets for pennies on the dollar. Fiat is why we have a consumption economy where growth is always necessary to maintain it which means more destruction to forests, more plastics in landfills, and more pollution. Wars are highly incentivized with fiat currency. Sky high debts that your children and grandchildren have to pay for your wasteful governments spending are only possible with fiat.

True. But *someone* is holding onto that money at all times. Not necessarily the same person, but perhaps a business, perhaps your bank account, perhaps in your wallet or til.

> most people that complain about this don't have any money to speak of... If you have 1000$ tops in your account, wtf do you care about 2% inflation?

Yes, it will hit you even if you have no money. Why? Because the economy is a place of cooperation via competition. When others succeed, it makes you better off. When you succeed it's because you have made others better off and are providing something that gives more opportunity to everyone.

What this means is that when other people do worse, you do worse too. If businesses that need to keep cash reserves do worse, they have to charge you higher (real) prices. This is worse for you and worse for the economy at large. Inevitably, wages also lag behind inflation, making things even worse for those with little money.

"I've been a terrible stock trader (and everything else trader) and have had only somewhat acceptable success by buying and holding -- no matter what the asset is. Our minds are our own worst enemies.

I was getting into the ""hot tech companies"" in the frenzy of the late 90s. Here's a great example: I held AMZN for a decade-plus where the stock didn't do jack. Go look at the chart from 1999-2008. When the recession hit I dumped EVERYTHING and went to cash and licked my wounds. Only I never bought back into AMZN because it killed my portfolio for so long. Then look what it did.  I am so pissed off at that company's stock. I probably DO own Amazon now, actually, but I only own it within index funds. I can tell you I've never had a sleepless night about buying/holding a boring ass index fund. Anyway the point is on individual stock trading, when it came down to it I had a decade of patience but I unfortunately did not have TWO DECADES OF PATIENCE with that one stock. Markets can be irrational far longer than you can remain solvent.

I have equally felt like a fool buying Bitcoin at many junctures, but I continue to just buy and hold and not try to do anything fancy. I started buying at $4K when people were saying ""I thought I was an idiot for buying at $2K, but I'm glad I got in when I did, you poor bastards buying in at $4K are gonna get rekt!"" . . .  and then I was buying at $7K and $9K and $13K. . . and we all know what happened since. And I still feel like an idiot most days.

Then there's the day that comes along when you buy at $7K and two weeks later the price is $9K.  I think a few years from now the 4-figure prices will be in the rear-view mirror for good.

If you take the time to make it right, you won't ear a thing (even at 75 db each). I've placed mine in the basement, made a sound proof case and connected them through the vents so it heats the whole house. My furnace starts half the time now. With 2300$ annual heating cost before I setup my miners it's worth every penny. I pay around 250$ a month in electricity for the miners and I make a little under 0.04 btc (used to make more). Heating cost is now under 1000$ a year now so I save even more. To keep mining in summer I've put a bypass to outside. I don't even lose cash then. 😉 Best investment I've made to my house!;2;0;False;UsualAwkward;ffxpd7j;Dear Peasants: Mining Bitcoin at a loss, IS OK.

"> tainted bitcoin is classic fud. send it among random wallets, coinjoin it, there’s so much you can do. taint is nonsense if you understand coin control

Huh?

If I steal your bitcoin and sell it to someone else, in many jurisdictions the person who bought the bitcoin stands to lose it, and you can sue for restitutions from the place you received it. If you know nothing about me and it's a cash transaction, you're fucked. 

However, if you buy provably stolen bitcoin from an exchange and lose it, you can then sue the exchange for selling stolen goods: restitution. This is why any sane exchange would not accept any level of taint.


Taint is very much not nonsense, it is ""we can trace this coin back to an illegal source.""
