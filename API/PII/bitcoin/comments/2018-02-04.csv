If BTC prices are going down no one will accept it in trade, not when it's so volatile. 2% inflation per year that is very predictable works out well, but no one knows where BTC will be tomorrow.

Why would I spend 0.05 BTC on something today rather than $400 if in a week that 0.05 BTC could be worth $500 and the $400 in USD would be worth the same (essentially)?

There is a crazy bull run which goes hyperbolic before pulling back. In theory it will continue this pattern if they become mainstream and are used everyday. Just be patient.

Don't be silly. The history shows that the price has risen. You haven't intelligently spotted booms, they've just been happening.

> Cashing out coins has never been concern to me at all, and I’ve done it with no issues quite a few times now

Yes, but if you keep throwing your money back in you will lose it eventually. The bubble will burst, maybe it already has.

Point being (a) You've lost money by selling and buying back at a higher price, maybe you feel this has hedged your bets, but it certainly shows that you don't have any great insight, and (b) You have no more idea than anyone else what the future holds and (c) You're most definitely not smarter than anyone else.

> Also, I’m not sure what you mean by selling isn’t instantaneous

"**Escalation of commitment**

Escalation of commitment is a human behavior pattern in which an individual or group facing increasingly negative outcomes from some decision, action, or investment nevertheless continues the same behavior rather than alter course. The actor maintains behaviors that are irrational, but align with previous decisions and actions.

Economists and behavioral scientists use a related term, sunk-cost fallacy, to describe the justification of increased investment of money, time, lives, etc. in a decision, based on the cumulative prior investment (""sunk cost""); despite new evidence suggesting that the cost, beginning immediately, of continuing the decision outweighs the expected benefit.

That's another topic. You could argue that Bitcoin value represents blockchain itself, BTC being the daddy himself of all crypto is being seen as a brand, as an ""index"" of the whole sphere, and let's be honest, blockchain is just getting started.

"I was talking about where you have both USD and BTC . Practically no one has their entire life savings and daily spending money (meaning a checking account, cash, credit card, etc) in exclusively BTC. Assuming you have $400 in cash USD and 0.05 BTC and can choose to spend either you'd be dumb to spend the BTC and not the USD.

Your example also works, you'd just hold the BTC indefinitely while the price goes up if you have other currency to spend. Which is my point, BTC doesn't work as currency because it's always economically preferable to hold it and spend USD instead.

Gold worked in the past because fiat currency wasn't a thing. Given that people hold both and both can be spent, it only makes sense to hold the deflationary currency and spend the inflationary currency.

"Suppose blockchain does get implimented in a major way, why does that increase the value of Bitcoin? It doesn't. Blockchain isn't some proprietary system that companies can buy, profits made from blockchain don't get distributed to holders of Bitcoin. *The only way for Bitcoin to appreciate is by new money buying coins at increasingly higher prices.* That's pure speculation, my friend. The greater fool theory at its finest. 

""Value"" is relative but in most cases it's backed by some underlying fundamental source of income. Growing corporate profits, interest yields, dividend payments. With stocks you can extrapolate a price-to-earnings ratio. With yields you can calculate an objective ROI. You can calculate neither of these for Bitcoin. Why? Because the price is based 100% in speculation. BLOCKCHAIN DOES NOT MAKE MONEY.

The fact that BTC investors have convinced themselves that there's profit to be had by the widespread adoption of the underlying technology (which, frankly, seems unlikely given the scaling problems associated with ""proof of work"") demonstrates the fundamental disconnect between crypto ""investors"" and the financial realities of investing capital.

"**HODL**

HODL is a slang term and Internet meme that is used in the Bitcoin community when referring to keeping, i.e. holding onto the cryptocurrency rather than selling it. It originated in a December 2013 post on the Bitcoin Forum message board by an apparently inebriated user who posted with a typo in the subject, ""I AM HODLING."" In 2017, Quartz listed it as one of the essential slang terms in Bitcoin culture, and described it as a stance, ""to stay invested in bitcoin and not to capitulate in the face of plunging prices."" The Street.com referred to it as the ""favorite mantra"" of Bitcoin holders. According to the Financial Times, it was the reddit forum Buttcoin that helped popularize its use.
