">You are muddying my original point with straw man tactics. The point is all that value is not in a bank. You're obsessing over how much it is exactly.

And your too dumb to understand that none of that value exists, it's all paper value, there is no liquidity backing cryotos price.

>So you mean you didn't buy back at 6000 and sell at 11000? 

Read what I said, I sold at 16k. I don't play around in illiquid markets.

>You honestly think it's going to 2000? Now who's the noob?

I don't know if or when, that's not how trading works, I've got my price (for the lulz). If you think bitcoin can't get to 2000 then you either don't understand market dynamics, how asset pricing  works, or your very new to bitcoin. Most likely you're both.

>>This is next level stupidity. That's not how banking works, kiddo.

>If it's in crypto it's not in their possession. Stop being an obtuse cunt.

Go learn how a bank's business model works, kiddo.  Banks make money through lending at a higher rate than the interbank rate, in the case if the US the Fed Funds Rate, and they can borrow as much as they want at this rate as long as they are able to find enough debtors. That's just the commercial banking side, the other end is investment banking and brokering for private clients/financial institutions. Banking was one of the best performing sectors last year, as banks raked in record profits, which are still growing. 

Your argument that ""money in crypto = money not in banks therefore crypto is affecting the banks bottom line"" is something a five year old child would come up with, a five year old who doesn't understand how the banking industry actually works. There is never a shortage of money for a bank as they can just top off their reserves at the interbank rate. The only way to actually harm a banks bottom line would be if people stopped financing, which as crypto has shown us will never happen, lol how ironic.
