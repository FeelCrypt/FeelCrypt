"A berkshire hathaway share is just over $300,000. Why is that? Because they never split. 

https://www.ft.com/content/f8043504-67d9-3baa-8f5a-a2ae451e80a8

The difference is you can buy a fraction of a bitcoin, but you can't buy a fraction of a berkshire hathaway share. 

Berkshire hathaway is ""lumpy"" in that the capital chunks are huge (300k per share).

Seconded! This organization is changing how the world thinks about charity. It sets the bar for what it takes to make a difference in someone's life because: why do something elaborate with your charity rather than just give people the darn money! Charities should have to show that they're doing more with the money than they could by just forking it over to the people they're trying to help.;1;0;False;;drg014j;I'm donating 5057 BTC to charitable causes!

not all charities are on there. For example, cannabis research in the US is very new, and most nonprofits have not been in existence fore more than 2 or 3 years, and have not raised much money due to prior legal restrictions. However, they are posited to revolutionize health care once properly funded.;2;0;False;neurodork;drety3s;I'm donating 5057 BTC to charitable causes!

Молодец Бог ему поможет и его родным. Уважение таким людям. А тут случилась беда огромная и не дай Бог такую беду какая приключилась у нас  в этом году. В какие фонды не писали и президену, и в банки и Патриарху. Ни кто не копейки. И полная тишина и безразличность к людям. А вопрос то был всего лишь родных с почестью похоронить. Ну пусть я не желаю им зла, но натерпелись мы сильно, ещё предстоит такое мученье, но тут хоть бабуля старенькая , но отрубают потихоньку ноги, паркинсанизм её давит..

"I suggest a donation to the Mida Creek Conservation Community Awareness Group (MCCA) in Kenya to allow them to install a de-centralized Solar PV electrical mini-grid.

MCCA is a group that consists of villagers that live in a UNESCO bird biosphere reserve in the coastal region of Kenya.  They pool their revenues from providing bird spotting walks to tourists, canoe rides to see flamingoes and other birds and moonlit dinners for tourists from a small restaurant.  From the pools of revenues 30% goes to a bursary for school expenses for the villagers' children.

Unfortunately as the villagers live in one of the poorest areas in the coastal region of Kenya they are unable to afford electrical connections to the grid.  

A de-centralized electrical mini-grid will allow modular, scalable and efficient usage of Solar PV energy to provide electrical energy for fridges to store vaccines/medicines/milk, freezers to store fish instead of having to dispose harvested fish at throwaway prices immediately, irrigation pumps to help increase yield of small farms in the area, a de-salination plant to provide clean water from the existing brackish water, and lighting that can help conserve the endangered mangrove trees in the area that are sometimes burnt to provide light.

There are currently 52 homesteads that can be assisted in the area.  Each homestead consists of around 5 to 7 homes with each home containing around 7 to 8 familiy members.  A typical homestead can be seen here: https://i.imgur.com/YXC1JfO.jpg

Using a new de-centralized swarm electrical energy product from a Swiss company called Power-Blox (www.power-blox.com) a mini-grid in the area can be setup within 3 to 4 months for the villagers networking all 52 homesteads together to create a networked electrical grid.

A donation to install a de-centralized Solar PV mini-grid will greatly improve the ability of the villagers to improve their earning ability and uplift their lives.";0;0;False;mombasa123;drfpno7;I'm donating 5057 BTC to charitable causes!

"This is absolutely amazing. You sir are a rare breed. 

I'm a huge proponent of keeping our rainforests and indigenous tribes safe and protected. Which is why I hope you consider Rainforest Foundation US as another charity for your fund. I have donated to them many times and they are very transparent and are super hands on in how the money is spent. The ED herself spent over a year in Peru just recently.
