Exactly. If Coinbase goes \*poof\* so does everyone's Bitcoin. Even a BitPay wallet is better than keeping your BTC at Coinbase.

"No sir.  Federal reserve notes are not dollars.  A dollar is money.  By its very name it is not money, it is instead currency.  It is something that is traded.  A federal reserve note is like a claim check to money.

Ever go to the dry cleaners and drop off a coat for cleaning?  They give you a claim check, (that is a piece of paper), that you can use later to get your coat back.  That is how they know which coat to give you.  If you wanted to give your coat to someone else, you could just give them the dry cleaners claim check and they could go to the dry cleaners with it and get the coat.  But we can all agree there is a big difference in wearing a coat or wearing a claim check.

Is gold money?  Answer: yes.
Is a receipt for gold stored in a bank vault money?  Answer: No, but it could be currency.  If someone was willing to accept the receipt or claim check for gold in a vault in lieu of the gold itself.

If you refuse to understand the difference between real money and a promise to pay someone money, then I cannot help you.

If you think a one dollar federal reserve note is a dollar, then their plan has worked and you have been tricked just like millions of others.  I used to think the same thing, until I discovered the truth.  Granted, it was not easy to grasp at first, but keep working on it.  Don't fall victim to prolepsis.  Just because your parents and all of your friends think that a FRN is a dollar and call it a dollar does not make it one.  There used to be dollars, but when the US left the gold standard for money, notes were issued to replace dollars.  They look similar, but words have meaning, and those FRNs of today have very different set of words on them.

I really think you could benefit from the youtube video in my comment.  I think you are not understanding the abstraction between an item and the receipt for an item, or its proof of ownership.

"Yeah I get that, but he's surrounded with people who argue with him about what gives value to Bitcoin. I find it hard to believe that nobody told him what ""owning"" bitcoins meant at any point. It is one of the key feature that gives value to Bitcoin (i.e. the control you have on your funds as long as you know your private key and keep it secret/secured).

So either he refuses to learn/accept this, or he's really unable to learn it. Either way his critique that ""Bitcoin has no value"", cannot be dissociated from this property of Bitcoin, it's so fundamental.

Maybe this loss will teach him (although I've already seen him repeat that Bitcoin has no value again [no later than today](https://twitter.com/PeterSchiff/status/1220189536044691456)...).

"I’m not too familiar with all the ways to go directly cash to BTC and vice versa, surely that would involve finding someone with BTC who is willing to hand over the private keys / do a transfer to your wallet in exchange for the cash. To me that sounds like it could go wrong a few different ways and definitely isn’t for me.

I’ve used Coinbase for every purchase of BTC I have ever made. My banking is managed through one of the more prominent institutions in the US, and I have my bank account hooked directly up with my Coinbase account. I did all the verification etc. when opening the account. Whenever I want to buy I just go through Coinbase, select amount, and within a few days everything is as it should be, and you can transfer your coins off the exchange after something like 2-6 days, which I’m guessing is to ensure the transaction doesn’t get rolled back.

You’ll sometimes see some negative reviews of people having bad experiences with Coinbase, but honestly, I’ve never been disappointed with the service I have received when buying BTC through them / transferring to my cold wallet. I think if you have nothing to hide / acquired the money used to buy the BTC legitimately, you will have no problems using them as they were intended; as a form of exchanging one form of currency for another (cash <—> BTC).

Full disclaimer, I have never actually tried selling my BTC and cashing out back to the bank, because HODL, naturally. And I would be doing the community a disservice if I didn’t throw in the reminder of don’t leave your coins on the exchange. Transfer them to a cold wallet and take care of your seed phrase.

"Many Keynesian economists make the argument that Bitcoin can’t work as a currency because it’s deflationary, ‘people will just hoard money instead of spending!’ and the argument is absurd. It ignores how we used precious metals as money through most of human history, causing exceptionally stable prices over hundreds of years, and second, people can’t delay most purchases. You can’t choose to not pay that rent payment, or buy food or toilet paper because it will be slightly cheaper in six months. 


The real reason the financial elite prefer inflationary, constantly-printed, quantitatively-eased fiat is simple: they’re closest to the money spigot. They enjoy all the benefits of the [Cantillion effect](https://www.aier.org/article/cantillon-effects-and-money-neutrality/).

Deflation is a specific problem in a monetary system, that can survive only, if it is exponentially growing. If it can't grow exponentially, it will collapse. Besides the risks of such a system, we can't afford exponentially growing resource consumption anymore. If we continue with the current monetary system, our habitat will be destroyed in 200-500 years even with carbon neutral economy. The only way mankind can survive longer is to abandon the current monetary system and replace it with something more sustainable, which doesn't require exponential growth.;9;2;False;bitsteiner;fffw7b9;Prince Charles: We need a new economic model or the planet will burn;etd2f1;https://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/esx9z0/prince_charles_we_need_a_new_economic_model_or/

"**UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD YOU GIVE US YOUR PRIVATE KEYS**

&nbsp;

Hey guys, I've just launched a tech version of a ""Dead man's switch"" that I think could be useful to the crypto community with a no information free-trial.

My service will let you create messages (with attachments) that will be delivered to your contacts in the event you fail to tell us you're still alive.

&nbsp;

Example messages for protecting your crypto could include:

>1) ""Hey (spouse), I'm dead, the PIN to my hardware wallet in my desk is 387238""

>2) ""Hey Mom, I'm dead, the password to the encrypted Bitcoin wallet on my computer is hunter2""

>3) We offer the ability to cURL your own server (www or .onion) so you can trigger your own thing without us knowing what it is.

Of course this service doesn't have to be used for crypto, you can send any messages you want. We've made this service as trustless as possible.

&nbsp;

We accept Bitcoin (and Monero, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, Litecoin) natively (running our own nodes) meaning you can be fully anonymous and never have to deal with things like Bitpay payment protocol during checkout. We have a very strict privacy policy you can read in plain english here: [https://absentplan.com/pages/privacy](https://absentplan.com/pages/privacy)

&nbsp;

Use promo code **reddit6** for a 6 month free trial and please provide feedback!

&nbsp;

#Brief list of Features:

- Client side encryption for messages or use your own. (PGP + AES).
- In house cryptocurrency payment processing so you can be anonymous if your situation needs.
- SMS and Email delivery of messages.
- SMS and Email delivery of reminders to check in and tell us you're alive.
- We can monitor your Facebook and Twitter for signs of life if permitted.
- cURL your own server (www or onion) if there are no signs of life (eg: dismount encrypted devices you don't want anyone to see).

"This sounds like the bank was protecting the customer’s account because, well, doesn’t seem the wife is on it. Or it would be her account as well, and there would be absolutely no problem.

Something to keep in mind - the banking system is pretty darn hard to navigate as well if you’re unfamiliar. It’s also riddled with artificial traps (overdrafts) and rules (maximum # withdrawals on a savings account, etc.) one must abide by.

Sucks to see this situation, but I’d the mom’s name is on the joint account - there should be no issue. If a check made out to multiple people is deposited to an account owner by 1 of the 2 people, I believe the check can still be deposited without the 2nd person being on the account. If you’re the 2nd person trying to access that money, you won’t be able to because you’re name isn’t on the account.

This. Yes it’s frustrating and seemingly indifferent to human decency but credit unions, along with banks, are held to extremely strict standards by the federal regulatory bodies that oversee them. If someone isn’t a primary on the account, depending on the opening terms of that account, they don’t have full access. It is usually best to have two separate accounts with a trust or other special account type for shared funds. One spouse being primary and the other secondary is, due to regulatory oversight, asking for headache in the event that something goes wrong. It’s shitty but the credit union seems to just be adhering to regs in this case. It’s “not their fault” because and exception for one person could result in an overwhelming fine or other penalties and financial organizations just aren’t willing to accept that level or risk. Their whole business model revolves around risk management and “hit with sanctions” is too big of a risk factor to accept.;34;2;False;Hopefound;fffeo5f;Found on another thread.

The bank has a legal obligation to recognize the father's property rights. As much as the mother feels wronged, this is the same system that protects your money in the bank. That said, the family fucked up...what married couple doesn't have a joint account? The only fact we can glean from this (probably fake) post is the father did not set up a joint checking account.

Carrying this over to any cryptocurrency, if the father didn't share the private key with the mother, she would be in *worse* shape because there's not even an option for legal recourse.

"Right now, every transaction on chain reveals a number of pieces of information:

* The amounts involved
* Linkage between transactions and (pseudonymous) identities
* The ""type"" of transaction (e.g. simple payment, multisig, atomic swap, Lightning channel opening, ... and more complicated things).

Taproot primarily addresses the last of those three. In many cases, it can make all types of transactions look identical (of course, only assuming wallets update to make use of Taproot). It's one aspect of privacy that's often forgotten compared to others, but it is relevant. For example, if FancyWalletCorp comes out with a new product tomorrow that relies on a 7-out-of-11 multisig with a timelock tomorrow, they're likely the only ones who use that exact construction. That would mean it's trivial to recognize their users on chain. Taproot has the potential to fix that. If all goes well, a Taproot transaction on chain looks like a single (random) public key, and a single signature on chain.

There are a number of other things included. Most of these are necessitated by some of the primary design goals, but are useful on their own:

* Schnorr are used; this can reduce the number of signatures needed in complex policies (""smart contracts""), permit batch validation (verify all signatures in a block faster simultaneously than individually), and enable things like simple atomic swaps through adaptor signatures.
* A number of extension mechanisms are added that make it easier to improve the scripting language in the future (adding opcodes becomes very simple, relatively speaking).
* The way signature hashes are computed is improved, which helps address some known issues, especially for offline signer devices.";59;4;False;pwuille;fffljnl;Please explain Taproot and Schnorr Signatures usecases in layman language.;etagx4;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/etagx4/please_explain_taproot_and_schnorr_signatures/
"I didn't say that gold or the dollar was fungible. However, they're both good examples of what can pass for legitimate fungibility in a government issued currency. I was saying there aren't levels of fungibility. There is only two answers to the question of if something is fungible. I'll even give you a hint, it's a yes or no answer...

Sure you can identify the source of a brick of gold by spectrograph analysis, or trace a stack of $10s by their serial number to the bank it was last handed out by. But that isn't something that's common, as you mentioned. However, what is common is for companies and 3 letter agencies to sift through every possible amount of data on a transparent blockchain. 

I think you are mistaking fungibility with distinguishability, individuality, and/or tracibility. I hope you realise that those four terms, while inherently related in this instance, are certainly not synonyms...

And despite the couple downvotes above, I'm still not wrong. Fungibility means that one unit of something is worth exactly as much as any other unit of the same denomination. Fungibility is neither unnecessary, nor impossible to attain. 

I'm not shilling Monero, I could care less if you are or aren't interested in it. It's useful to me, therefore I use it. That's all I said. It is fungible, therefore, it is useful to me.

"Everything that you can do in Bitcoin right now can be done using taproot (and thus schnorr signatures) with less space and increased privacy.

Suppose you had a contract codified as a Bitcoin script, and this contract (i.e. script) has a few different outcomes depending on some conditions. Bitcoin as it is now would reveal all of those outcomes and their conditions. Under taproot, only the outcome and condition that is actually in effect is revealed. All other outcomes and conditions become hidden. This increases privacy (by hiding other outcomes and conditions) and saves space (the other outcomes and conditions are ""compressed"" into hashes.

There is also the top level ""expected"" outcome and condition. When this is used (and it should be usually used as it is the expected outcome), the spending transaction will appear as if there was no contract in the first place. So none of the alternative outcomes and none of the actual conditions for spending are revealed.

Schnorr signatures are merely a means to an end: taproot. There is no need to distinguish between taproot and Schnorr signatures as taproot requires Schnorr signatures, and Schnorr signatures will only be used in taproot.";13;0;False;achow101;fffimoy;Please explain Taproot and Schnorr Signatures usecases in layman language.;etagx4;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/etagx4/please_explain_taproot_and_schnorr_signatures/

"After reading up on all this, I'll do my best to try and summarize.

Currently Bitcoin can be locked into a contract and be sent only when certain conditions are met, such as multi-sig or time lock using P2SH (pay to script hash). The details of the contract are stored as a hash on the blockchain, but when the contract is executed ALL the conditions are revealed to the network even if they weren't fulfilled. Since not all wallets allow multi-sig or time lock for example, this information can be used to potentially identify the type of wallet being used. Not great for privacy. Also, all the unused conditions are data-heavy on the network.

The proposition fixes this by increasing obfuscation and decreasing the amount of data needed to be stored in the blockchain.

MAST (Merklelized Abstract Syntax Tree) uses Merkle trees to obfuscate each individual condition by hashing it, only revealing the first condition met.

Schnorr allows the aggregation of transactions, by using a single common signature instead of multiple individual signatures. When used with multi-sig, users can aggregate signatures and public keys into a 'threshold public key' and 'threshold signature'. This allows a complex transaction to look like any regular transaction.

Taproot combines Schnorr and MAST. The threshold public key and threshold signature are 'tweaked' using the MAST structure made with the conditions, so it appears just like a regular public key and signature but with the conditional logic completely hidden within.

Changes which involve more moving pieces often have a BIP/specification/reference implementation and after the reviewing/testing there either is (rough) consensus or not.

"It's actually really unclear what happened. It's clear that at some point there was written history close to the Mediterranean. At some point that written history ends and a new one starts. Towards the end of that history the sources that we have from around the Med slowly lost contact with the northern peoples. While one theory is that there was an invasion across the med from the middle East/north Africa, this doesn't explain why the people in the north disappeared first. One popular explaination is that there was an economic crash. For the first time in human history, people were living lifestyles that could not be suported without some kind of trade economy (think people in cities where food has to be imported from miles around) and when the trade collapsed people started dying, and this is what left the Mediterranean peoples vulnerable to invasion from the ""sea people"".

"**Late Bronze Age collapse**

The Late Bronze Age collapse involved a Dark Age transition period in the Near East, Asia Minor, the Aegean region, North Africa, Caucasus, Balkans and the Eastern Mediterranean from the Late Bronze Age to the Early Iron Age, a transition which historians believe was violent, sudden, and culturally disruptive. The palace economy of the Aegean region and Anatolia that characterised the Late Bronze Age disintegrated, transforming into the small isolated village cultures of the Greek Dark Ages. The half-century between c. 1200 and 1150 BC saw the cultural collapse of the Mycenaean kingdoms, of the Kassite dynasty of Babylonia, of the Hittite Empire in Anatolia and the Levant, and of the Egyptian Empire; the destruction of Ugarit and the Amorite states in the Levant,  the fragmentation of the Luwian states of western Asia Minor, and a period of chaos in Canaan. The deterioration of these governments interrupted trade routes and severely reduced literacy in much of the known world.

"The answers to your questions depend a lot on the threat model you are trying to protect from. F.ex:  

> Or do I need to wipe my Ledger and create a new wallet?  

No, you can continue to use your old wallet, as long as you don't reuse addresses. A third party observer won't be able to make a connection between the ""old"" addresses and the ""new"" ones (as long as you don't consolidate them together, which is why [coincontrol](https://medium.com/@nopara73/coin-control-is-must-learn-if-you-care-about-your-privacy-in-bitcoin-33b9a5f224a2) is so important).  

However, in order to show you your balances, your Ledger wallet has to connect to Ledger's backend, and their backend can make a connection between all your wallet's old addresses. Even if you wipe your wallet and create a new one: as long as you are using Ledger's backend, you are leaking privacy. You will need to use your own node instead, if you want more privacy (this is not only for Ledger: same for Trezor and any other wallet).  

> What's the best hardware wallet manager software for privacy (electrum, armory, etc)?  

Electrum, **but only used with your own full node**. The setup looks like this generally: `your node` -> `Electrum Personal Server`-> `Electrum` -> `hardware wallet` (you can replace Electrum Personal Server with ElectrumX or Electrums, they all fulfil the same purpose more or less).  

> Can I send them back into the same wallet on Ledger under a new address and remain private?  

Yes in general, but see the disclaimer about Ledger's backend. Also you need to have some good practices how to send coins **after** you mixed them (don't send the same amount back to the Ledger that you send to Wasabi originally, don't merge mixed and unmixed outputs etc).  

There is a lot to learn when it comes to privacy on the bitcoin network and unfortunately, it is not always intuitive. So don't be afraid to ask and be gentle with yourself :)  

I wrote a few hints for better privacy here, incl some further reading, perhaps this is helpful:  https://old.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/cjp2h9/crash_course_in_bitcoin_privacy_incl_reading/";73;2;False;TheGreatMuffin;ffeq4lg;Need help with anonymizing my Bitcoins;et82ak;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/et82ak/need_help_with_anonymizing_my_bitcoins/
"> This is correct but you still have to trust that a significant amount of others in the coinjoins are not colluding and they handle their outputs properly. Your theoretical example is a nice incentive but doesn't guarantee anything. 

Luckily there is proposed technology which can improve joinmarket's sybil resistance to be even better than monero: [Design for improving JoinMarket's resistance to sybil attacks using fidelity bonds](https://gist.github.com/chris-belcher/18ea0e6acdb885a2bfbdee43dcd6b5af/) Calculations show that against this system a sybil attacker would have to send 45-120 bitcoins to burner addresses to have a chance of a successful attack.

Game theory doesn't offer guarantees, only incentives. All cryptocurrency is based on the game theory of PoW (provided its implemented correctly, which many altcoins fail at). You could equally say there's no guarantee that a transaction won't be reorg'd out by miners. That's true for your favoured altcoin too.

> I would agree that joinmarket is the best but coinjoin is weak privacy. And I vehemently disagree that wasabi makes your coins ""more fungible"". I don't even agree that there are levels of fungibility in the strictest sense.

Thank you for providing your opinion. It's very valuable. :P

> And it increases the chance that your coins can have prejudice applied to them if you end up with outputs that are linked to crime. And that prejudice can be applied at anytime and retroactively. And that a 3rd party can arbitrarily apply prejudice just for using coinjoin. Wasabi coinjoins are easy for them to identify and binance has already applied prejudice to a wasabi user. That is the opposite of ""more fungible"".

Fungibility issues also affect monero, as we see many exchanges have banned that altcoin from their site. Prejudice has been applied to the entire cryptocurrency.

The real solution to censorship is to not use centralized exchanges, which is partly why this subreddit has [a list of p2p exchanges](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/dyclf8/list_of_bitcoin_persontoperson_p2p_bitcoin/) stickied to the top for weeks now.

"What trust is required in joinmarket? The problem of trust in other coinjoin solutions is due to their centralization, not inherently because of coinjoin.

The problem of other participants behaving correctly is solved game-theoretically in joinmarket because market makers have an incentive to just keep their coins coinjoining forever so they can continue to earn coinjoin fees.

Yes exchanges can block coinjoins but many exchanges already block Monero (your favoured altcoin)

In wasabi's defence, coinjoins do improve bitcoin's fungibility because when used correctly coinjoin outputs become indistinguishable.

"One of the problems with coinjoin is that it requires trust.  Trust that the people participating in the coinjoin are not colluding, trust that the service isn't tracking data and trust that most of the participants that you have no control over also do everything perfectly.  Even if you do everything right, you still need to rely on a bunch of other people to also do everything right.  And in the end exchanges can still see you were mixing and choose to apply prejudice.
  
Also, I wouldn't use wasabi.  Wasabi is a scam because they use false advertising to market their product.  They claim on their website that wasabi makes Bitcoin fungible and it does not.
   
Until things improve there are better options(but more expensive) if you want to break the link between your Bitcoin and your identity.  One of the better options is to use another coin that is untraceable and then spend it back to Bitcoin using a service that supports both tor and doesn't perform KYC.

You have to consider that every problem creates an opportunity.  So much can happen in that time frame and innovation is certainly going to be one of them.  You can still send zero fee transactions.  And miners can create services where you pay a flat fee abstracted from the transaction to have it mined.  It's impossible to say what 500 years in the future is going to look like.

If you said something like “it may hit 5k at some point before the end of the year” I’d say sure, maybe it will. I personally think it’s unlikely, but I don’t know shit. 

The point is to give yourself some wiggle room in your price forecasts.

Best not to assume anything either way for now. If you're looking for a dip to buy cause it's too high, it's safer to DCA.

"someone looking to unload bitcoin.

Basically what happens at an exchange is there are a bunch of people without bitcoin trying to buy it, and a bunch of people with bitcoin trying to sell it. No one cares whom they sell it to, and no one care whom they buy it from, just as long as they get the best price. So if the last bitcoin sold for $8600, someone might be trying to buy it for $8599. If someone selling bitcoin is willing to take the dollar loss, they sell it to that guy and the new ""price"" is $8599.

Let's say you just saw that trade go through, and you think, ""Wow someone just got a bitcoin for a buck less than it originally cost! I want to try!"" So you put in an order to buy bitcoin at $8598.

Now on the other side, there's some  poor guy trying to *sell* bitcoin because he needs the cash. And he just saw the price drop a buck! ""Oh no!,"" he says, ""The price just dropped a dollar from $8600 to $8599! I'd better sell my bitcoin now before it drops any *more*!"" So he sees your buy order for $8598 and is about to agree to that price, when some lady says *she'll* pay him $8598.50 for it. He of course sells to *her* because he gets more money in the trade. The new price is now $8598.50 .

...and now you're hooked to this rollercoaster of watching prices fluctuate, all the while praying that your buy order gets filled and you didn't just witness **live** the last time ever that bitcoin cost as little as $8598.50, and you MISSED THE BUS because you were too cheap to offer an extra 51 cents!

There's no current amount. You can sell for any price you want, even 50k. Nobody will buy from you because they can buy for less elsewhere. If you want to sell then you will lower your price, just like selling your old stuff on eBay or Craigslist or whatever.;1;0;False;jenny82ishere;ffejhq9;Who actually controls the usd rate per crypto?;et5l3g;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/et5l3g/who_actually_controls_the_usd_rate_per_crypto/
Thanks for great post. Can I ask though, why does all crypto go up and down at same time by drastic drops or increases in 2 minutes? I watch portfolio on coinbase drop very suddenly across all crypto. It doesn't look very human controlled.;1;1;False;Quethrosar;ffetbs8;Who actually controls the usd rate per crypto?;et5l3g;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/et5l3g/who_actually_controls_the_usd_rate_per_crypto/
"I think you're stuck on the idea of ""control."" You're right, there is no one single human setting/overseeing/controlling the price, it's a bunch of irrational humans all trying to get what they want--bitcoin bought or sold at the best price for them.

Get on coinbase pro from your coinbase account and just watch the order book. [https://pro.coinbase.com/trade/BTC-USD](https://pro.coinbase.com/trade/BTC-USD).

To understand what's going on, try reading this: [https://medium.com/@trontrade/order-book-what-is-it-how-to-read-it-and-why-5cf6255696ce](https://medium.com/@trontrade/order-book-what-is-it-how-to-read-it-and-why-5cf6255696ce) and see if it makes any sense and imagine yourself trying to buy or sell bitcoin at a given price.

If you're really anxious to learn this quickly and don't mind losing $20, put $20 into your coinbase pro account (which you'll have access to via your coinbase account) and try to buy as much bitcoin as you can with that $20, then try to sell it at a profit and get yourself up to $25.

So if you see the Last Trade Price (i.e. the current price) of bitcoin is 8,479.80 USD (top left corner) use the Order Form (middle left) with LIMIT selected (not MARKET) to try to buy $10 worth of BTC at a some lower price... say $8,469. You'll see it show up in your ""Open Orders"" and be able to scroll down the Order Book and see where your bid is. Now you're rooting for the price to go down until it hits the price you set ($8,469) and your trade will go through and you'll own a little more than .001 BTC! Play with the scale on the lower chart to see buy and sell ""walls"" appear at prices where many people have set their bids.

You might notice that the price is rising and you don't think your order will ever get filled because there are so many big orders ahead of you for higher prices. Obviously a seller would take those prices before they take your lowball offer. So you'll have to cancel your order and readjust your offer. Too high a price in USD gets you less BTC in return than you could've gotten, and too low a price in USD means that you'll never see your order get filled. Once it does get filled, try to sell the BTC for profit and see what that's like.

Over the course of this, you'll realize what's going on in your mind as you try to get the best price is what's also going on in everyone else's mind on the exchange. You'll see the price go up and down and realize no one has true ""control"" over it, it's just everyone acting in their own best interest.

For more information on why prices can stabilize, google ""buy and sell walls."" Then, to understand why prices sometimes go from stable to skyrocketing up or down, imagine what happens when a whale comes along and has the money to knock down those Buy and Sell walls if they want.";1;0;False;SexAndDanger69;fffh5ai;Who actually controls the usd rate per crypto?;et5l3g;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/et5l3g/who_actually_controls_the_usd_rate_per_crypto/

"If you are looking to Sell bitcoin for fiat money, then the methods available will differ based on a few factors:

- Where are you located (country)?
- How much are you looking to sell?
- What methods of payment will you accept?
- How soon do you need access to the proceeds?
- Is financial privacy important?

You mention USD , so presumably you are U.S?

There  are payment methods for P2P trading, such as buyer deposits cash in your bank account, or transfers the funds to your account.  Know that there are risks in being defrauded when using bank transactions for Bitcoin trading, but if your buyer has a long and excellent trust history the risks are much lower.

"First off, how much do you pay for electricity?

At something like ~$8.5K BTC/USD, the bitcoin miner's equilibrium is about $0.07 per kWh, using an Antminer S9 and today's difficulty level.  This means if you pay more than ~$0.05 per KWh, unplug your ASIC miner and sell it -- it's cheaper to buy bitcoin than operate a bitcoin mining rig.  You are competing against professional miners who earn a decent profit by paying just $0.03 per kWH.

And that equilibrium fluctuates based on difficulty and the exchange rate, so don't count on $0.12 equilibrium lasting.  It could easily drop to $0.07 or much lower even in the next year.  And with [halving](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/cejo72) coming in May, your BTC revenue will drop by nearly half.

- How much are you looking to buy?
- What payment methods do you have available?

- Is financial privacy important?

First time buyers may like the convenience of an online store that sells bitcoin and accepts debit and/or credit card. I do not know which ones require ID verification/KYC beyond those marked as such. (e.g., [Switchere](https://switchere.com) [**NO-KYC**], [Rebiton](https://rebiton.com) [**NO-KYC**], [Bitsell X](https://bitsellx.com) [[💳](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card)] [**NO-KYC**], [CoinCorner](https://coincorner.com) [[💳](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card)] [**NO-KYC** when £900 or less], [CEX.io](https://CEX.io.com), [Coinify](https://www.coinify.com), [Paybis](https://paybis.com), [Jubiter](https://app.jubiter.com/neworder/buy), [Bittylicious](https://bittylicious.com), [BitIreland](https://bitireland.ie), [Kuna.io Money](https://money.kuna.io), [LiteBit.eu](https://www.litebit.eu/en/buy), [Conio.com](https://conio.com) App, [CryptoVoucher.io](https://cryptovoucher.io), [GetSatoshi.org](https://getsatoshi.org) ([⚡](https://lightningnetworkstores.com/wallets)), [Cash App](https://cash.app/bitcoin) and CoinMama). You can buy BTC on Cash App without ID but you won't be able to withdraw them until you are KYC verified.

You can purchase online using a No-KYC online store, paying by depositing cash in a bank account or through Moneygram/Western Union:

- [BitQuick QuickBuy](https://www.bitquick.co/quick-buy) [**NO-KYC** (when trx amount is under $400)]

There are physical locations where there are Bitcoin ATMs and other vending/voucher methods.  For example, in the U.S. there is:

- https://coinatmradar.com  <-- Some will require Identity verification/KYC, others just a phone number (e.g., CoinFlip ATMs, when $900 or less), or nothing at all
- https://www.coinstar.com/bitcoin (with [2,200+ locations in the U.S.](https://coinme.com/kiosks))  <-- Identity verification/KYC
- https://libertyx.com/a/buy/locations  <-- Cashier (cash), and/or Kiosk (debit card)
- https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/dabf2m  <-- Some will require identify verification/KYC, but not all will.

Otherwise, an in-person cash trade or an online trade using a P2P trading exchange may possibly be your next best option:

"When you setup hardware wallet you get 12/24 words of seed as recovery backup. Never ever store this electronically. Use only paper and pen. 

But now it is dangerous for you if you lost or is stolen your recovery seed.

Sure you can have multiple written copy, split it to multiple parts and so on.

[https://wiki.trezor.io/Shamir\_Backup](https://wiki.trezor.io/Shamir_Backup) is math way how you split your recovery seed for example to 3x 20 words seeds. And you only need any 2 from 3 those  sequence of words to recovery your originally seed recovery.

So you can store them on different places. So if is one sequence of words is stolen/damaged, your bitcoin is safe and you are able recover your seed from rest of words sequence. You can choose even bigger ratio 3/5, ... and so on.

And about buy at once. It depend on your budge. If you buy for 100-2000 USD for example, sure is ok buy it at once. But what if price will go still down? It is nice have some extra cash 10-20% from budget  to buy more.

I know that feeling you missing a boat. But nobody knows when and where is bottom. For example one of my strategy is I buy more every time price goes down or up with 1% if I don´t have already bought on this level. Split budget to cover 20% move over month. Than store bitcoin to Trezor, then add new money and start again. If some cash left from previous month, I split total budget  again to cover 20% move. So in long therm I get nice average price and don´t need timing market. 

Sure it can eat some profit on bull rune in short time. But I don´t need solve emotions when buy big portion and next hour market goes down.";1;1;False;czechcryptomania;ffekphe;Bitcoin Investing;esyk8c;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/esyk8c/bitcoin_investing/

Not exactly, I entered .2 and pressed “Preview Buy” and then got a text, I went to the text and came back accidentally pressing “Buy” and it was done. Believe me, I don’t need to be told how dumb that was. What was worse is that I thought I had entered .02 so as if accidentally buying .02 wasn’t bad enough, it was .2 which basically wiped me out. But I get paid tomorrow and I think I’ll consider this my investment for years to come.

"Hello Mark, 

I have answered your multiple times and explained those funds were not sent to the wallet you gave us information to. 

Additionally, as mentioned, only natively supported funds can be swept from an Abra wallet. 

As Abra only natively supports BTC, LTC, BCH and ETH these are the only funds you can sweep from a wallet. All altcoins (BSV) are held by Bittrex.

So once again, I do not see those funds were sent to that wallet but if they have been sent to any Abra wallet they are lost. Because you sent BTC to a BSV address they could still not sweep it as the funds are not natively held on it. 

We apologize for the confusion, but those funds have been lost.

">so it does not increase the Dollar supply.

Correct.  I agree with you there, but it does increase the federal reserve note (FRN) supply, which is less than the overall total supply.

The way dollars are created for use by people (i.e. circulation) is by someone borrowing them, at which point they are created, and then the person who borrows them, spends them by exchanging them for goods or service.  Then that is redeposited into a bank.  This can be done completely electronically without any FRNs on the planet at all.

There is not the same amount of federal reserve notes, in dollars, as there are dollars on deposit in all of the banks.  The amount of dollars on deposit and the dollars created by a credit account have nothing to do with FRNs.

The FRNs that exist are purely a function of people requesting them when making a withdrawal or cashing a check from an account, and the arbitrary regulatory requirement for banks to physically have some small percentage on hand.

If tomorrow, everyone on the planet stopped using FRNs forever and just used digital dollars, (i.e. credit card, debit cards, checks, wire transfers, etc.), there would be no need to print more FRNs.  And due to the liability of storing them, banks would probably turn them all in to the fed and they would just destroy them since they are a liability without benefit at that point.

"It is not an abstract concept, this is how banking has been working for centuries and is well known, although not thought in schools correctly.

"Now for cash currency, a.k.a. federal reserve notes.

Banks are required to have in their ""vault"" a certain amount of physical cash notes based upon the amount they have in deposits.  Remember that deposits are debit accounts.  These store the dollars that the bank owes its depositors.  Any when I say vault, I just mean physically on hand for withdrawals.  The vault may include the teller drawers or the safe under the counter as well.

I do not know the ratio, but let's say that the amount is 10:1, ( it is probably more like 100:1 though).  Therefore, if the bank has $100 on deposit, then it has to have $10 in physical FRNs sitting on the shelf in the bank when it opens that day.  As the cash goes out the door, the debit accounts are reduced by the same amount.  So if someone comes in and takes out a $1, the bank's vault is now smaller by one FRN, but so is the deposit account, so it still balances with respect to the ratio requirement.

Likewise, if someone comes in and deposits $10 in FRNs, the bank takes them, puts them in the teller drawer and then increases the balance of the debit account of the depositor.  In this scenario they may have an excess of FRNs with respect to the amount on deposit.

At the end of the day, they tally up their deposit balances and their bank vault FRN balance and if they do not have enough FRNs they can get more from the federal reserve.  A Brinks truck or other service will physically move FRNs from where ever they are kept to the bank.

If the bank has more than they need, then they will have a Brinks truck come and pickup the excess notes and move them to where ever the federal reserve keeps its excess FRNs.  This way the federal reserve can balance the demand for FRNs among its banks.  Excesses are moved to cover shortages.

If the federal reserve is running low on FRNs, then they call up the US Mint and tell them to print more and send them over.  The number of FRNs in circulation is a function of people asking the bank for FRNs when they take out cash, or cash a check.

If you go to the federal reserve's web site they will show you how much US dollars there are in total in deposit accounts, credit accounts, and physical FRNs.  The amount of FRNs in dollars is a few trillion, but the amount of digital dollars in bank computers is hundreds of trillions.  They have names for these types of money supplies that they call the M1, M2, M3, M4, etc. money supply.

Just do an internet search for US money supply and I am sure you will find much more enlightening info there.

In the case of the $20K loan you took out, if you wanted it in cash notes, you could get it, but the bank would probably ask you to come back in a day or two.  The reason is that if they give that much in notes to just one person their ratio will be way out of balance that day and they fear they will not have enough for other depositors making withdrawals.

So, what they would do would be to order an extra $20K FRNs so that when you came to pick it up, their ratio of deposits to cash on hand would still balance.

&#x200B;

I took $5K out in cash one time, and they said that they would give it to me, but they would rather that I come back tomorrow since taking that much out would throw their cash on hand balance way out of balance.  So to be nice that is what I did.  They also said that if I needed a large cash withdrawal to call them the day or two before so they could order up the cash and have it on hand for me.  Which is what I do now.

I can take out up to $3000 without issue, but when I ask for $5000 without notice they get squeamish.  If I asked for $10,000, I know they would say to come back the next business day.  The amounts may be slightly different at your bank and based upon the regular cash withdrawals that you make.

"I will start with dollars, that is digital dollars in the bank computer, then I will cover paper currency, aka federal reserve notes.

&#x200B;

Let's say that you want to buy a car for $20,000, but even though you have a job you do not have the $20K.  You go to a bank to get a loan for the dollars.  The bank decides, that with your job, you are a credit worthy.

So the human at the bank then clicks a button on their computer to create a **credit** account for you.  (Take note that I said credit account.  I will explain debit account later).  Then the computer ask, how much for the account.  The human types in 20000.00.  The human then presses another button to print a check for $20,000.00 payable to you or the car seller.

You then take that check to the car seller and give it to him and they give you the car.  Now, you go to work, get paid, and use some of that pay check to pay back the loan.

Before you took out the loan, those $20K did not exist, but with computers all it takes is a few clicks and there it is.  Hence digital dollars.

Then the car seller then takes the check to his bank, which may be the same bank as yours for the loan or another bank and deposits it into his **debit** account; aka checking account.  Let's say it is the same bank.

Now that bank has a loan for $20K and a new deposit of $20K.

&#x200B;

Now about the two accounts credit vs debit.  For a bank, a credit account is an asset for them because it pays them money.  The borrower has to pay back the principle of the loan plus the interest.  Anything that pays you is an asset.  Banks get paid in many ways, but a few are borrowers making loan payments.

A checking or savings account is a liability to the bank, and an asset to you.  It is a liability for the bank because they have to come up with the money when you demand it.  That is, **they** owe **you**.

I get that he might use this and play the victim to his ""base"" (which might legitimately struggle learning what Bitcoin is). But conceding that it should be easier than remembering a password, when any digital valuable asset is locked behind similar or even harder security schemes (2FA, identity checks, etc.)  doesn't do any good to our argument.

So we're are at the point that the people who really care about a scarce digital asset HAVE to learn some security basics... or they will be left behind.

"I looked into it, I earned money in europe, while I was working oversees for an extended period. So I needed to get my money on a canadian account to be able to spend it. Bank transfers cost 50-60$ and take a couple of days. Speed was not an issue for me, at this point. Doing it over bitcoin would require me to buy BTC with euro and buy CAD with BTC on the other end.

"I just launched Bisq.  I don't see any offers for SEK (of any payment method) that you could use to do a buy.

That doesn't mean you couldn't find a seller that accepts Swish if you put up an ad with your offer.   With Bisq though, there is a small amount of bitcoin you would need to commit to the potential trade transaction when posting the offer, so keep that in mind. 

I spot checked other P2P exchanges as well, .... either no sellers or at a poor rate.  The best rate was this ad on Paxful, using Revolut and ~8% above spot!

But again, placing an offer to buy on these might let you find a seller at a fair price.   

Many people that are repeat buyers will use this tactic of placing Buy ads to find a repeat seller.  Subsequent trades then need not necessarily go through that P2P platform as simply you as buyer let the seller know how much and wehn.

I'm in the U.S., so I've no idea.  I would presume since the funds are coming from SEK, there's a conversion cost to convert to EUR when the recipient currency is to be EUR.  If Swish does that, then yes -- there are better priced offers using EUR.

> How long does the transactions usually take on bisq? 

- https://bisq.network/faq/#trade-periods

It's person to person, so it may vary based on the seller.  The Bisq app needs to remain online to keep the ad listing active.  But once the counterparty sees the new transaction, it can be just a matter of minutes, before the transaction has completed, with the ""escrowed"" transaction amount being released to the buyer.

> And can you get scammed easily or are the users mostly serious?

Bisq now uses a 2 of 2 multisig transaction, so if buyer & seller cannot agree on outcome, then the funds go to the Bisq DAO.  Only subsequent appeal to moderator / arbitrator might get a decision from an abritrator  if there is significant reason to believe one side versus the other).  So keep documentation (e.g., screen shot of mobile app when sending, for example) to have overwhelming evidence that the payment was made per instructions.  Only communicate in the Bisq trade chat, not on outside chat networks (where the arbitrator cannot trust the authenticity of the messages).

Of course there's no guarantee, but Bisq has been built to try to remove as much of the risk related as possible through the use of economic disincentives (for trying to scam, etc.).";1;0;False;cointastical;ffepjfa;Second bank to block my ability to deposit to crypto exchanges;est8kk;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/est8kk/second_bank_to_block_my_ability_to_deposit_to/

Please look at the details of [Grsham's law](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gresham's_law). It only applies when one currency is pegged to another. There are countless examples of situations where stronger money is or was more widely used. For example, dollars in many countries in the world are preferred over the national currency, sometimes even when dollars are made illegal. 

That isn't to say that people will stop using national fiat currency entirely. The money press is the primary source of most governments loans, and people who aren't in a position to quibble will accept things of lower value where the alternative is nothing.

"The OP's question is a misnomer that reeks of an incomplete economics education.

Money is simply the most liquid store of value available. If you want to make a new money, you must start by making a store of value that everyone accepts. Governments do this by stockpiling gold and saying that their new currency is backed by that gold. For most of the US's history, private banks issued their own fiat money, backing it by gold for the same reason.

A payment platform is very secondary to the store of value function. It's the icing on the cake, not the flour.

"Miners ""mine"" new blocks in exchange for a reward of bitcoins.  The halvening is a point in time when the reward given to miners for doing work is cut in half.  This means 50% fewer bitcoins are added to the network over the same period of time going forward.

Right, I was reading a post about why a government can't just buy up crypto in large amounts. As soon as they started to, it would skyrocket the price making the last coin they bought way more then the first.

"A computer that can break encryption doesn't control the network, that sounds like the movie Sneakers. It would require either private key authentication where the public key is known or access to the link layer during a remote authentication. Not even fair to compare that to how much they would own on the Bitcoin network with the same cracking capacity.

Still, it wasn't my point anyway. My point was security. Banks can fail, but they are backed by the government to some degree. If someone either had a way to crack keys or found another way to exploit the network, they could run off with your savings and there's literally no recourse. As banks fail, the economy fails and Bitcoin doesn't help. If Bitcoin fails due to some exploit or someone dumping coins, it's likely to be an all or nothing fail.

I'm not saying Bitcoin can't do it, I'm saying it doesn't do it. Governments could stop backing their currencies and that would also change the discussion.

As for mistyping an address, I'm using that as an example of inconvenience. Credit cards are easy and part of the reason they can be easy is that they use their income to provide customer service. You can lose a credit card or forget your password and they will authenticate you as a person and reset your password or send another card.

The Lightning Network might be a way to bridge the gap, but it will take centralized backers who hope to get money back from it to fund POS and ATM infrastructure, but doesn't that put us back in the same spot as credit card companies? They can't rely on the value of Bitcoins going to infinity, they'll just take a fee and pull it out to a government backed currency as quickly as possible.

As for the current value of Bitcoin, I think it's a farce. The utility provided by Bitcoin today is not enough to justify the value. The speculative value may be there, but it's contingent on it being easier to use. Wider adoption would stabilize the price. Ironically the gambler's mentality that is so pervasive in crypto is a large part of that volatility.";1;1;False;Dhegxkeicfns;ffe38bl;Old guy meets alien tech;eskvul;https://i.redd.it/ui1khywq8fc41.jpg
"In a distant future where we could create a quantum computer able to break all encryption I hope we will upgrade to something better than SHA-256. I've already heard that concern. Today's quantum computer can barely have use dozens qubits. To break an RSA key, you would need millions of qubits and to break all in a reasonable amount of time billions. If that computer existed, forget about national security, banks or the internet. Bitcoin would be the least of our concerns. An entity that could create such a powerful machine would probably be the single most powerful on this planet.

The whole reason the credit card fraud thing exist is because credit cards are extremely unsecure. If you follow security 101, nobody can fish your private keys and buy a lambo with your Bitcoins. It's impossible. Even credit card fraud is not absolute since many people don't get refunded.
Where was the insurance in 2008?

Insurance requires a fundamentally flawed system to work. You wouldn't need insurance or fraud protection of it wasn't a thing. The only time people loose coins is because of their own stupidity and there is no insurance that covers stupidity.

No possible way someone could find a weakness. It can never fail, so your Bitcoins are as safe as a lump of gold in your sock. You have faith, so there's no way you'll see the reality that it's a great tool, but it's not there yet. It's an awful place to hold money long term.
