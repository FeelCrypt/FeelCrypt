"most people have the passwords/mnemonic phrase/private keys written down/backed up somewhere (since forgetting the password is a bad idea), which is why in most cases bitcoins have been seized the government has been able to get the keys as well.

having no backup/hardcopy doesn't eliminate risk it just changes one to another, from having someone steal it to forgetting it. Plenty of people have lost access to their own bitcoins.

Even if they can't get the keys they can still get the bitcoins, and if someone tries to move them at a later date they're not going to have to look very far to find out who did it.

Its hypothetical security is irrelevant compared to its real world security. Anything is technically unseizable if you hide it somewhere and don't tell anyone the location. The problem comes when you actually want to use it.

The fact bitcoin has to connect to the internet to be used makes it much less secure (which is why hundreds of thousands have been stolen in hacks so far, greater than any equivalent bank heist), because you can't download someones gold over the internet.

Traditional banking gets around this by having monopoly control over a private network, so if someone steals your bank details and moves money out of your account, and you can prove it, the bank has to refund you.

"**Byzantine fault tolerance**

Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) is the resistance of a fault-tolerant computer system, particularly distributed computing systems, towards electronic component failures where there is imperfect information on whether a component is failed. In a ""Byzantine failure"", a component such as a server can inconsistently appear both failed and functioning to failure detection systems, presenting different symptoms to different observers. It is difficult for the other components to declare it failed and shut it out of the network, because they need to first reach a consensus regarding which component is failed in the first place. The term is derived from the Byzantine Generals' Problem, where actors must agree on a concerted strategy to avoid catastrophic system failure, but some of the actors are unreliable.

Is it just coincidental that transactions decreased dramatically from batching at exactly the same time as price started crashing?

Let's say that is the case, and major exchanges just started batching at the same time, and it happened to account for a huge amount of transactions, this doesn't help the case that there's greater adoption.

That means well over 50% of bitcoin traffic is from exchanges, which means people just buying and selling bitcoin for other currencies.

That's why metrics like how many of the biggest 500 retailers are using bitcoin matter because they tell you whether people are actually using bitcoin as a currency or just speculating and day trading.

Do you think no one consumes anything, or ever will?  If everyone hoards, and goods are being produced, I'm gonna buy the shit out of it and live like a king.  Eventually there gets to be a point where people say ""fuck deferred consumption, this is great now"".  Plus people already have a time preference for consuming in the present.

Hoarded cash isn't investment, correct.  It's simply a representation of a preference for deferred consumption.

Yes, if it all of a sudden went, prices go up, and then the preference for consumption goes down.  But if you see a bunch of people holding cash for future consumpion, and prices are low, you can make a killing preparing for it and investing (e.g. R&D, expanding factories, etc...) so that you can produce a ton when the time comes to change.

"Okay, but that's a different kind of ""trust"" than we normally mean when we talk about ""trust"" in /r/Bitcoin. We mostly use that term to refer to the trust you might have (or be forced to have) in your bank, or in your spouse, or in your employer.

Your ""trust"" seems to be more about *predictability*.";1;1;False;bpj1805;duh2inh;Bitcoin Doesn't Give a Fuck.;7yaaz2;https://v.redd.it/ty2y74gawug01
