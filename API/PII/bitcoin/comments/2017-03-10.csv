"> Did I know it before the Primary? No.

Thank you for the honesty.

> But after seeing Nevada, Utah, and others, the leak ended up being more ""no shit"" than ""no way"". 

Ok, now that's some deep analysis.

> The leaks may have finished the puzzle, but the picture was visible well before them.

You just said you didn't know...

>  Exit polling being off by a greater percentage than our State Department says indicates election fraud. Debates being scheduled when they would have the lowest viewership. Locking out Bernie for reporting that there was an error in the database... Occam's Razor had long since settled on the DNC pushing Hillary.

All of which have plausible deniability. Polls can be wrong (wtf that indicates fraud...), debates could have been scheduled the way they were due to tons of other factors, according to DWS, ""The Sanders campaign has provided us with the info needed to restore their voter file access; now it's time to refocus on winning "" so he just didn't filed the proper paperwork (now thanks to wikileaks we now know she was complicit). And you do not understand Occam's razor at all. It is an heuristic, a guide, and in no way a decisive criterion, and your application of simplicity is obviously heavily tainted by your partiality as a Bernie supporter.

>Most people don't even read the articles. The headlines were the story that people remembered.

Sometimes the title contains sufficient information, and the user can read it later too. Yes some don't care and grandma and crazy uncle Joe share every conspiracy theories anyway, but like I said for a small but not negligible portion of people, a story from major news outlet who actually (most of the time) have journalist doing their homework verifying sources have a huge impact (Wikileaks haven't been shown wrong so far). A post from CNN and Fox News and the New York Times has way more impact than Infowars and other militant news/blogs. So yeah, most americans are dumb or simply don't have the capabilities to understand, yet it doesn't mean it did not have an impact and that impact would not have been the same without the content. And if content doesn't matter, then explain pizzagate.

>The headlines weren't typically ""DNC puts thumb on scale for Hillary""; if you only read the headlines, your perceptions of the leaks had no basis for magnitude beyond the longevity of the story.

Again, talking in the name of everyone else is not an argument.

>Since WikiLeaks was steadily leaking the emails, the story's longevity seemed infinite at points.

I'm not sure, but I think they said it was on purpose for this exact goal, since most people forgot Snowden leaks (which were very brief). Yet it doesn't mean the content didn't matter. In fact, it couldn't have ran that long without new information coming out.

> The private email server became conflated with the DNC leak and the media narrative people remember was something entirely different from the truth.

Again, talk for yourself. Besides, they are not mutually exclusive.

>Looping back to the start of this conversation, It takes exceptional naivete to place such an immense difference between 100% and 90% certainty when you're in a zero-sum game, especially when you know that the 90% certainty will stay at that point because the person able to provide that certainty has said he wasn't going to.

""Everyone knows Bush allowed 9/11 to happen"" by Infowars and prison planet doesn't have the same impact as ""Leaked documents show Bush ordering CIA to place thermite inside WTC"" by MSNBC, CNN and Fox News.

> Assange admitting to having RNC emails but that ""they weren't interesting enough"" to release is clearly him showing a bias.

Or maybe he's simply telling the truth and the emails are only about logistics and official spam. See, even being 90% certain, without proof you statement doesn't have much value.

> All you have is Assange's word that they're not interesting while he was actively leaking against the DNC and had been telling GOP voices like Roger Stone to prepare for such leaks. Don't assume Assange had altruistic intentions.

Who knows? But then Assange is a publisher, not a leaker. Snowden didn't need Wikileaks to leak. Wikileaks is not a monopoly. If he lied and the leaks were published elsewhere they indeed were incriminating for the RNC then that would certainly discredit him. I think he is smart enough to know that while making this kind of statement. But then again, I have no proof.

"* Collusion with jounalists to not only plant specific stories (some patently false) but also veto bad ones against their candidates
* devising questions media should ask repub candidates

* organising fake ads pretending to be from trump
