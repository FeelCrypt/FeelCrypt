bitcoin offers a total reconfiguration of society. It's a money system with out the previously established institutions like banks, taxes and political money system which are based on state issued identity.

This is an end to economic slavery. There will be no quantitative easing, no central planning or central banking and existing systems of democracy will have to be rethought out with voluntary participation. 

Decisions will be made closer to where the money is at like at individual level, family level or their city level. A new Decentralized world. There is no sending taxes to Washington for central planners to re allocate the money back into society. There is no sending part of your retirement savings to wall street and hoping the central planners will re allocate the capital smartly across the industry. Old rules do not apply any more.

"This is right answer.

To be more explicit, the reason you need 2 clones is so that after you lose one you can easily move the funds to the new wallet.

If you lose your single hardware wallet and only buy a single replacement, the steps are:

1. Order new one and wait for it to arrive
2. Initialize new wallet and store seed words
3. Save the receiving address(es) of the new wallet
4. Reinitialize the wallet with your old seed words
5. Send the funds to new address
6. Reinitialize the the wallet with the new seed words.
7. Pray your funds stayed put long enough to do this.

If you follow parent comment advice. The steps are:

1. Open new wallet, copy address
2. Open old wallet, send to that address (maybe leave $20 at the old address to see if it gets taken... you can come back later for it.)
3. Reinitialize old wallet to new spare seed
4. Order replacement for lost hardware and initialize to a new wallet at your leisure.

"This site is not a good indicator of when the halving will occur.  

I suspect the site is calculating the average block time over only a few blocks rather than several days and so the expected halving date will fluctuate widely.  The average time between blocks on this site is currently 8.20 minutes and right now it gives the halving as occurring on 24 April.  

You need to take several days worth of blocks to get a reasonable average time between blocks.  Taking it over 1 day there is an error of about 8% as blocks arrive with a poisson distribution.  Taking the average over 2 weeks gives an error of about 2% (difficulty adjustment error).

Get a few hard drives.  You know, those ""boomer tech"" thingies with the spinning metal frisbee inside.  The thingies that don't slowly die after a month or two if they're left unpowered for that long.

Get a copy of Truecrypt 7.1a.  Yes, it works.  No, there is no indication that it is compromised.  The developers apparently abandoned it because they got identified by the NSA and they didn't want to be forced to sabotage their own work.  If you don't want to trust it, that's fine, pick another encryption package, GPG or VeraCrypt or whatever you want, it's your coins at risk.

Save your keys in a file.  Encrypt the file using the above and a strong password.  In fact, you can pick multiple programs and use all of them to hold the file, layered in multiple levels of file containers.  Put the end-resulting file on the multiple different hard drives.  Store the hard drives in different locations.  Geographically dispersed different locations -- your house, your local bank, your favorite cousin's house in Milwaukee, a hole you dug in a national forest somewhere in another state.

Periodically check these drives to ensure that the data is accessible and not corrupt.  You don't have to open the files, just checksum them or do a file comparison.

To add to the security, use full disk encryption on the drive (that's two layers of encryption someone has to break) and put an absolute ton of other random files on it.  You can even name the file you stored your keys in something like ""tentacleporn01383.jpg"" and bury it in an entire directory of that stuff in similarly named files so that no one will ever look at it.  Hey, you can tack it on the end of a real tentacle porn image, or bury it inside using steganography or a comment field, so that it will even look like a real tentacle porn image if someone opens it.

Now you don't have to worry about someone seeing a chunk of steel with words stamped into it and realizing ""hey, that must be Cryptolover34's seed phrase! BWAHAHAHA SUCKER!!!""

"One thing that most people don't see is that as price rise is best plotted in log scale on most charting tools, it is always presented as semi-log. Growth curves in this presentation appear logarithmic.

 It is most accurately represented in log-log. As in, the time axis also needs to be log scaled. I have not found one single place where that can be done. Though I have seen the plots done by others and the result is a perfectly linear channel.

So I think you are correct. I think future price projections are legit. Probably two more major cycles until the 500k - 1m region where Bitcoin becomes myspace and fades away leaving mom and pop as bag holders. Maybe not, maybe the betamax model plays out, we shall see. But ultimately, the time scales are going to get progressively longer. Longer bears, longer bulls.

However much steam this current trend has (none in my view), the halving is no more of an issue other than to manipulate price to the traders disappointment.

Cost of mining has hovered around 6.5k throughout 2018. Newer equipment puts the price of mining around 4.4k. You can see that reflected in price action and the longer time frames. The halvening shouldn't do anymore than reset the price of mining to 8.8k, which will need to be tested for support and shake out the miners with legacy equipment. So at 9.4k, the price is overvalued currently. However much the price rises, the smart money is selling into to for the inevitable retest of long term support and faith, challenging even the holders of newer equipment. Coincidentally, that rising support line should reach about 8.8k on May 1st.

So anything over 8.8k just isn't a good buy until the mining businesses finish competing and crushing each other out of the market.

Hocus pocus TA fanboys might want to note price is peaking on fib fan lines today. Hype is is at full stride, aggregated longs are 80% and most traders lose.

You should look at some of the sidebar resources.  You are asking great questions and i think you'd benefit from those sources,  specifically lopps site.  The answer to this question could be nuanced depending on definitions and interpretations, but only mining nodes make money and include transactions in blocks thus getting tx fees. Non mining nodes still validate transactions, but do not place tx in blocks.

It reduces the inflationary mining subsidy, not the transaction costs. Users can still pay miners to do transactions and this does not effect the miner income from that source.

"I wonder if this halvening actually causes a major price increase, if the price will increase EVEN MORE than expected precisely because at least some future halvenings will be priced in the moment we see it's for real again?

At present, quite a few people here have never been through a halvening, but they've been through a bubble bursting from 2017, which is when probably tons of newbies joined up.  Enough people are skeptical that it might happen again, so fewer people are probably pricing in anything in the future, waiting to see if anything happens.

But if it does, then it would have done this price rise for a 3rd time, and it makes me think that immediately wall street and other financial institutions (that are now more positioned to take advantage of this asset than in the last halvening, which was when BTC wasn't as mainstream and Mt.

If a business doesn't take a credit card you can't use a credit card. It's not that bitcoin doesn't have instant solutions, people just have to choose to use them and accept the trade offs.

For instant payments you can use zero conf by just not waiting for confirmations, and the receiver risks a chargeback similar to a credit card.

You can also use lightning payments for instant non-reversible payments with micro-cent fees. This relies on past and future bitcoin confirmations for security instead of at the time of transaction.

"It takes time for on chain transactions to get a couple of verification (5-6 with 10 minutes block time) just like it takes time for a bank to transfer physical assets to another bank or for your cash or gold by mail to arrive at destination.

That's what on chain transactions are meant to replace, not instant transactions, for instant transactions you'll have to use second layer software. Banks has credit cards, paypal, or proprietary prepaid phone wallet apps while Bitcoin has the lightning network (decentralized) as well as mobile wallets, exchanges with phone apps (works like any traditional centralized second layer payment solution) etc..

You'll find Bitcoin on chain transactions convenient in the following cases:

* When you want to send money to a different country
* When you want to pay your invoice but it's weekend, banks are closed and the deadline is in a few hours
* When you want to buy something your government doesn't want you to buy
* When the store's card readers are offline or the store is out of electricity, bank is down or VISA is down but your phone is reasonably charged and your 3G/LTE connection works

Lightning payments are even more convenient, they're not only replacing the credit cards or your proprietary phone payment app, but it can also do the following:

* 100% network uptime, DDoS resistant etc, no centralized payment solution could ever be this stable
* No censorship. You buy anything you want, it's your own hard earned money, why should someone else tell you what you can and can't buy?
* Increased security, you never have to give anyone your private spending keys (which is what you do with your card all the time, those printed 16 digits is all the merchant need to charge nay amount they want from your bank account). You only transfer the actual value (same for on chain transactions obviously).
* Might receive a discount as Bitcoin tends to go up in value thanks to it's marked based value rather than inflation, also thanks to less risk for the merchant because they know that once they receive the payment they cannot get scammed or robbed like they can with traditional fiat solutions.";12;2;False;adipemanatidaephobia;fg6a9ta;How can bitcoin be useful if it takes up to an hour to transfer funds?;ex5amd;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ex5amd/how_can_bitcoin_be_useful_if_it_takes_up_to_an/

Remember that spendability is relative to the wallet you are using.

Its unspendable by that wallet. But if you import your seed into a newer wallet from 2019 that BTC may be spendable...

In one context, a scammer will pretend to send you a gift of Bitcoin, tell you it is unspendable, and please top up the amount with 0.1 Bitcoin to make it spendable. This is a trick to steal 0.1 Bitcoin  

In another context, it is possible in many wallet apps to set up a watching-only wallet containing addresses, not keys. The wallet will track those addresses and tell you their transactions. Because  there are no keys, watching-only wallets are unspendable. The blockchain.com wallet uses this terminology

"You have two ways for making your bitcoins unspendable. The first one is the more complicated one and involves the creation of an unspendable transaction output, it means that you generate a transaction written in a way that the btc included in the transaction will be spendable no more. Usual wallets are not able to do that.

The second way is far easier, you just need to send the btc to an address whith no private key or a private key that nobody knows. There are several addresses of this kind in the btc environment. In the first case, you're theoretically sure that the btc are gone forever. In the second case, The btc are gone just as long as no one finds the private key of that address, but, if someone were able to do something like that, it would mean that the security of the bitcoin protocol would have been compromised.";2;1;False;AlexanderRow;fg5zceh;So im quite new to all this cryptocurrency stuff and ive heard there is something called unspendable bitcoin.

1. Don't spend it all.  If you sold after >1 year you can expect 15% taxes on it plus whatever your state takes.  Make sure you have the money set aside in cash to pay this.
2. Expect to pay for a software specifically for bitcoin tax forms, there are a few reputable ones out there. this could be about $40.  The software makes it pretty easy but it also takes a few extra hours on your taxes.  Coinbase saves a transastion history so don't worry too much about logging them now.

"You have on chain transactions, these are quite limited and by setting the fees one can give it's transaction more or less 'priority'. Miners will tend to include those transaction with the highest fees first.
So this mechanism just works by supply and demand.

Since on chain transactions are the most secure, among others,  it is reasonable to think in the end only high value transaction will be included and those will probably also have high fees.

Massive small transactions will be done on lightning or other off chain solutions. These will be faster, cheaper, etc but will also have some downsides compared to on chain transactions.

Think of blockspace in supply and demand. There is only a finite amount that can be bought. If there is lots of supply and little demand then fees are cheap. If there is little supply and lots of demand then fees are high. The fee market works in a lot of ways like Bitcoin on the open market.

"**Bitcoin’s Unlikely Evangelist: Fidelity CEO Abigail Johnson**

In a rare public speech, she urges making digital currency more accessible for individuals and institutions

Abigail Johnson, who became CEO of Fidelity in 2014, believes some potential bitcoin users are confused or frustrated by the technology.

By
Sarah Krouse

Updated May 23, 2017 2:54 pm ET

Fidelity Investments Chief Executive Abigail Johnson championed the growth of bitcoin and other alternative currencies in a speech Tuesday, a rare vote of confidence by a major player in the financial world.

Her remarks at a conference in New York set her apart from other CEOs of large banks and financial services companies who have been cautious and even skeptical of bitcoin’s benefits. Fidelity first began exploring the possibilities of bitcoin and other digital currencies roughly three years ago.

“Some of you might be wondering: Why am I here today?” Ms. Johnson said at the digital-currency news service CoinDesk’s Consensus conference. “I’m here because I love this stuff...all that the future might hold.”

Bitcoin, introduced in 2008 by an anonymous creator, is a digital currency that operates online and is designed to allow users to transact with each other directly, bypassing governments and banks that normally act as middlemen in financial transactions.

Ms. Johnson, whose family owns 49% of Fidelity, is an unlikely proponent of digital currency. Her views are notable not only because she gives public speeches rarely but also because her firm is a major provider of 401(k) services and other savings products to millions of Americans. Fidelity had $2.13 trillion in assets under management and $5.7 trillion in assets under administration at the end of last year.

A more commonly held view was articulated by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. CEO James Dimon about three years ago, when he said bitcoin was “a terrible store of value” that could be easily copied, was viewed suspiciously by governments and was a favorite of drug traffickers and other criminals that want to operate outside of the financial system. He has, however, been supportive of blockchain technology, a spokesman said, and the bank has tested applications of it.

Ms. Johnson on Tuesday acknowledged digital currencies’ problems, laying out in detail the obstacles that bitcoin, and the blockchain technology that underpins it, face in moving from a slow start to widespread adoption.

“It’s no accident that I’m one of the few standing before you today from a large financial services company that hasn’t given up on digital currencies,” she said. “I am still a believer.”

Fidelity has worked with bitcoin platform Coinbase Inc. to allow charitable giving in bitcoin and enabled bitcoin payments in its cafeteria. Ms. Johnson said the firm will soon make it possible to display bitcoin assets held through Coinbase on Fidelity.com.

Yet fewer than 100 employees at the firm have completed bitcoin transactions, she said. Potential users of the technology, she said, are also confused or frustrated by it. Ms. Johnson’s speech stopped short of making firm recommendations on ways to make the currency more mainstream.

Regulatory, security and risk-related issues are major barriers to broader adoption of bitcoin and related technology after a string of headlines related to the cryptocurrency. Hackers behind the WannaCry cyberattack this month, which held for ransom the computer files of hundreds of thousands of victims, demanded payment in bitcoin.

Ms. Johnson, 55 years old, succeeded her father as Fidelity’s chief executive in 2014. Some attendees said they were surprised she decided to speak on the issue of digital currency instead of one more directly affecting the company’s mutual fund business or its large units in benefits or brokerage.

“I’d like to think that huge new markets and products are going to be built on these open platforms,” she said. “Blockchain technology isn’t just a more efficient way to settle transactions, it can fundamentally change market structures and perhaps even the architecture of the internet itself.”

Ms. Johnson urged the audience to make cryptocurrency and related technology more accessible for individuals and large institutions. “Too often we see bitcoin and blockchain technologies as solutions in search of a problem,” Ms. Johnson said. “We don’t just need these systems to be technically better, we need them to be more user-friendly.”

Ms. Johnson first became interested in bitcoin and blockchain about three years ago when the firm’s Fidelity Labs unit held a meeting that explored emerging technology that could affect its business or customers, according to a person familiar with the matter. She has personally participated in several of the firm’s bitcoin- and blockchain-related initiatives since.

She said that a computer she owns has mined “millions” of virtual coins known as satoshis, named after the unknown creator of bitcoin who published the paper launching the currency in 2008 under the name Satoshi Nakamoto.

Her affinity for what Mr. Nakamoto inspired was evident on a red, white and blue button affixed to her lapel that read: “Vote Nakamoto President.”";15;1;False;BitcoinFan7;fg6b0y9;Bitcoin’s Unlikely Evangelist: Fidelity CEO Abigail Johnson;ex0jrj;https://www.wsj.com/articles/fidelity-ceo-bringing-blockchain-to-the-masses-harder-than-it-seemed-1495548000

"This is my story with bitcoin, I'm prob gonna get sh\*t for it for people not agreeing with me for certain stuff (I'm used to it online and offline) but at the moment I don't care so here goes:

30-40 odd years ago in high-school, I was always into history  but teachers would want students to learn stuff by heart like zombies. I wanted real answers to my questions. Instead of learning stuff like a robot, I was too busy hacking people in the early days of the internet. Yes that's right in my teens I was controlling other people's PCs. I was very interested in how hardware and software works. I was told by my parents to get off the internet at 4AM being charged at normal call rates and keeping the landline busy..little did they know the internet would be big.

I studied in a different field, went to special forces/compulsory army, had 3 prestigious/top degrees under my belt I thought I could use to get me a jobs but that guaranteed me nothing.  I got an internship and stupidly like other people in my country I worked for free for about a month. Guys please learn from me and do not do any work for free. The only things that have ever given me a paid job up to now are my skills I obtained through my hobbies.

It was around 2007-2008. Had to move country (brain drain of the country) due to the economic crisis as my country got destroyed by its own government, the EU(inc ECB, German and French banks) and IMF. I was laid off because companies I worked at shut down. The only people still employed were over 50 years old, real youth (under 25) unemployment was 80%+ and the only people still working were the ones who knew people on the inside. I didn't have such connections. I believed in meritocracy; as in the more I try the more I will receive. The world doesn't quite work like that and throws you a curb ball once in a while. The country I moved to ended up also having huge unemployment. I had to adapt.  Countries had so much unemployment and I was looking for jobs. Recruiters shut their doors and only took-stuff in online because they were overwhelmed with CVs.

So I then became one of those conspiracy nutjobs (without tinfoil hats mind you). With 4 other people I ended up having a facebook group back in the day called the NWO- New world Order Resistance. It was about creating a community to talk about the new world order, globalisation, secret societies, central banks, the illuminati, bilderberg groups, the UN, deep state, wars, secret interests,  JP Morgan, Tesla, UFOs and aliens, witchcraft, the Rothschilds and Rockefellers etc..and history and how we can learn from the past to understand what is going on in the world today. It had 1.3million members before facebook (and the elite we were exposing) deleted it and all of our profiles. It was devastating but we made other groups which were deleted one by one. I was more upset that our information hub was deleted. All the data, videos and pictures were just gone from the group. Then facebook changed the messaging format; so instead of being like a messageboard where people could reply to each others comments, now people can only reply to the original comment. I believe this is to disconnect people.

Through my curiosity and research of how the world works and who runs it, I understood stories like Andrew Jackson leaving the central bank snakes, how we left the gold standard (1971), that (FIAT) money aka cash is backed by nothing, that private corporations like the FED control money/inflation and not governments, how countries have insane external debt and others don't and stuff like what the real motives are and who actually plans/profits from war. I then understood the importance of decentralisation. Max Keiser on RT was starting to talk about bitcoin in the early days of it. I was interested but it took me many years onwards to invest anything as I was broke and a family member passed away/shit happens. I also informed myself by downloading and watching as many bitcoin videos as I could. I learnt about the Mt.Gox scam and the Winklevoss twins.

Around 5 years ago, with some friends, for a brief time I ran a woke aesthetic slick underground media website that had a cyberpunk style look to its brand (way before the game was announced mind you). It was our registered company and we worked at home from 3 different countries. It was again tailored to uncover corruption in the world/so it was slightly political and also inform everyone of upcoming technology / web 4.0 towards informing people they can switch to uncontrolled things online like browsers and currency. Because we didn't get funding and had expenses we cut it short. I was then heavily active on the side of pepe in the pepe meme war of 2016. Too bad some people (hillary and pepe creator) turned the publicly made mascot frog into a racist character. It's the same with the ALT\_Right it didn't start off bad, just people jumped on the bandwagon and turned it into their own shit-show. I then saw people were selling memes online for crypto/pepe-cash.

I like the concept of bitcoin being backed by the amount of energy used and I also like the fact that there are halvings to account for inflation. I also like the fact the blockchain is backed up online(ledger).

What really concerns me is I read that 42.1% of all bitcoin as of December 2020 is held by 1000 whales, I am afraid of collusion. I am also concerned of bitcoin being bought up by the FED that prints money and can basically destroy bitcoin. Storing bitcoin on paper/hardware/exchange online also concerns me; as are buying fees and transaction times to be adopted mainstream.

I am not afraid of the EU central bank; their bureaucracy will get to the best of them. I am concerned about China who basically grabs the US by the @@ in terms of external debt but nothing else. The middle east like Saudi Arabia and the UAE have basically lost touch with reality; they have more wealth than they could ever need.

All these years later, I have still have a job that pays minimum wage in an unrelated field to what I studied, in an expensive country I am having difficulty paying bills and can't afford to buy anything let alone bitcoin.

I am waiting til BTC moons to $1m..will it? I don't know but I will wait (while surrounded with all the plebs that are clueless about crypto) and I'll look at my bookmarked sites. I just want a house, pay for a wedding, for kids and possibly a car. I'm not asking for much for f sake-I work a full-time job and still can't afford life.

Like most people I'm just an ordinary person trying to get by life one day at a time; I'm really struggling to pay bills but I am HODLing my few sats for a better tomorrow.

"I saw 2008 coming, a year or two before it happened.  

I knew that fiat money is a scam.  I knew about deflation and hyperinflation.  

I was looking for someplace to park some emergency ""wealth"" -- not in fiat, not in the bank.  I considered gold.  I considered silver coins.  I started keeping a stock of ""canned"" food and bottled water.  I read books written by people from countries that experienced economic collapse and/or things like hyperinflation, extended bank holidays, general strikes, high crime, etc.  I prepared.  

Having met a few refugees, and having read stories from others, I also gave thought to ""how could I carry some emergency wealth if I became a refugee,"" with no ""great answer,"" just so-so ideas.  

Time goes by, 2008/9 comes.  The criminal bankers get bailed out, etc.  At this point I'm ready to ""fight"" the Oligarchs.  Time for more thought.  I realized the best way to fight them is to, as much as possible, stop using their ""play money"" (fiat currencies).  But how?  

Eventually I heard about Bitcoin on the Keiser Report.  I asked a friend about it, and was aimed at the Bitcoin White Paper, which I read (very carefully), twice.  Then I went through it sentence by sentence.  I checked into the cryptography used and everything was legitimate.  I got really excited about Bitcoin, and have been ever since.

"

My bitcoin story follows an exponential curve of its own, and I’m just rounding the knee of that curve right now.  It’s a damn adventure.

We’ll start my story ahead of my actual engagement *with* bitcoin.

I remember hearing the news of bitcoin cracking $1,000 around 2014.  I was still in a legacy mindset but I’ve always been a deep-dive kinda guy, and I was just beginning to learn about the stock market; at the time I recognized a little ahead of the crowd that Apple, Inc. was going to be in a position to vastly increase its value by scheduling a 7:1 stock split ahead of the iPhone 6 release.

I didn’t have disposable income to invest directly, but I had a 401k at my desk job and I allocated 100% of it into Apple once I saw the groundwork laid above. Ended up doubling the size of my fledgling retirement fund inside of a year.

Fast forward to 2017, and I started hearing about cryptocurrency again and actually started learning about its history. Eventually found my way to the whitepaper.  Read it, comprehended its core assertions and principles, and recognized it to be a similarly-worthwhile “big strategic move” to my Apple maneuver a few years prior.  This was still viewed through the lens of the legacy system, though, as a simple speculative instrument that might earn me some dollars for my efforts.

I started on Coinbase buying up little amounts of bitcoin, ethereum and litecoin, monitoring and balancing amongst them and squeezing out little profits in the process, and then eventually got into the terminal game, registering for GDAX (now renamed Coinbase Pro) and learning the ins and outs of liquidity-making transactions.  Started doing limit buys and sells.  Followed news, wasn’t surprised by the 2017 bull run, bought fractions I could afford on the run up.  Purchased those from roughly 6k - 14k, totaling a $5,000 investment or thereabouts.

Sold enough of my holdings at ~17.5k to reclaim my initial investment, keeping the remaining bitcoin as profit. I had recovered all costs, which allowed me the psychological freedom to frivolously play with ‘house money’ and really poke & prod the market to see what I could learn about it.

This was around the time I started really understanding the sociological market effects that come on account of news cycles, global instability, environmental factors, et al, and I saw that even while the number of Americans aware of bitcoin was significant, it was orders of magnitude less ‘real’ and less understood than was concurrently being demonstrated elsewhere around the planet. I recognized that this most recent price boom was not only scheduled and predictable, but that each  boom also introduced bitcoin to a new audience (read: potential market) an order of magnitude larger than previously.  I recognized that the *next* boom was inevitable, and with a *lot* more eyes on it.  I started to recognize bitcoin’s antifragility before I had the vocabulary to label it so, but it was enough to get me to start buying more - but this time without the intention to sell for U.S. dollar profit.

I started stacking sats.  I also started having really long reddit conversations on the topic - deep dives.  The more of those I wrote, the more I wanted to understand it better.  I started *really* learning about fiat currencies, central banking, Modern Monetary Theory, and Austrian economics.  I recognized the true raw asymmetry of the competing schools of thought, and become a committed anti- capitalist.  My entire incentive from this point forward became to move as much money out of the legacy system and into the ideal system.

I started buying items with bitcoin whenever possible, and I started talking with my friends about bitcoin *a lot.*  I started a little game where I hired my artist/maker friends for $100 worth of bitcoin, to do their work for me one year from the time I paid them.  I redeemed $100 worth of their work on that later date and let them keep the change.  For most of them this is the first bitcoin they’ve ever interacted with, but once I do this they ALL immediately recognize the benefits of taking payment in that currency.

I continued to walk the walk, and all the while I kept reading, kept learning, kept understanding more and more of the weird oblique pressures bitcoin exerts against so many of our legacy systems, and all the puzzle pieces really started fitting together:

Remember that 401k I punched up with some help from Apple?  I took it back.  Cashed the whole thing out early, paid my penalties, and converted it into bitcoin.  Never have I felt so comfortable with an asset’s capability to not only preserve the worth I put into it, but that it can also capture and destroy the false value of our inflated debt-driven dollars in the process.

I’d been reading a number of fascinating essays and explorations of the global cultural precipice we seem to be standing on, and the psychological context it provided - along with the history of my study & experience with bitcoin - were the necessary preconditions to shape my specific reaction to the last four months of my life:

(1) I lost my job this past October. Went through the motions of looking for work, but nothing landed.  (2) My spouse and I decided to separate around New Years.  (3) My mom & grandparents that raised me back on the East coast are about to move into the home in which they will spend their twilight years.

At a time where I have no more stakes in the ground where I currently am, a major opportunity presented itself to do something significant for the people who have given me everything.

I looked at my savings.  I’m fine for the time being.  I have enough set aside that I can afford to spend a few months back home before looking for a new job.

A new job.

I didn’t want a new desk job.  I wasn’t passionate doing my desk job.  That’s when I was actually doing a lot of my reading and writing about bitcoin.  Also, I was getting *good* at explaining bitcoin to people.

I understand now that money is the lowest common denominator of motivation... that *bitcoin fixes this* is generally true and applicable toward literally every resource-related inefficiency as well as every nearly sociopolitical impasse, but only if exerted with properly-informed intent.

I began  refining my language and metaphors and writing little scripts that would be appropriate for five-minute conversations, for ten-minute videos, for half-hour lectures, or for two-hour reads.

On a lark, I pulled out all the little notes I’d been taking on my phone, and scoured my reddit history for all my writings related to crypto, blockchain, and bitcoin... and I managed to extract a full forty pages of writing.

I had already written two chapters’ worth of content for my bitcoin book!  In one fell swoop I recognized not only what dream I want to live, *but that I’ve been living it for months now without realizing it.*

Hell, this post is likely to become my book’s  introduction.

So.  I checked my finances again.  I checked my understanding of bitcoin again. I discovered, to my complete shock, that I may have already hit escape velocity I needed to hit, where I can draw fiat as needed from my “savings pension”, and whose value is growing faster than my rate of spend.  

I accidentally retired at 38 and have decided now, that the thing I’m doing all day long - namely, “trying to educate people about bitcoin and inspire pro-social mindfulness” is the only work that is important to me.

I have pivoted my entire life’s direction, and I’ve shot myself out of a cannon.  This is the only thing for me to do because it is the easiest thing for me to do.  I am passionate, sufficiently articulate, and motivated enough that it *became* the easiest option forward.

I don’t need luck; I accidentally crystallized my personality to an extent that bitcoin is going to get bigger because of me.  Here I go.";5;2;False;ritmusic2k;fg7802f;Your Bitcoin story?;ewxw95;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ewxw95/your_bitcoin_story/

I actually held till 10th of December and pretty much sold at the peak for about 120 dollars.;4;1;False;Basilis988;fg5cde6;Your Bitcoin story?;ewxw95;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ewxw95/your_bitcoin_story/

"A friend wandered into my office unannounced in mid-2011 and insisted he had to show me this new thing called Bitcoin. Thank God I wasn't in a meeting or under a tight deadline when he stopped by. We spent about an hour downloading wallets and passing a bitcoin back and forth. His description of mining sounded interesting, so I started mining that evening with a computer I had built for my kids. I had to shut down the miner most afternoons so they could play Minecraft.

By 2013, mining had become impractical without expensive custom equipment, so I stopped mining but kept reading and learning. The cryptocurrency space touches a wide variety of topics: hardware, philosophy, government, economics, even ethics. It also has a fascinating origin story, with an anonymous creator who eventually disappeared without a trace.

November 2013. A news story about the first Bitcoin machine caught my attention. I began to do research and bought a very small amount to begin with.  Over time I would take extra cash that I might normally waste and bought more. I didn't throw everything in but over time I acquired a nice stash.  Though I did lose some playing blackjack.  By December of 17 I was pleased.  Maybe I should have taken more profit but I am convinced this technology is the future.

"Back in the mid-1990s, I used to hang out in a structured messaging forum called USENET newsgroups. They predated what most people know of as ""The Internet"" today. One forum in particular, alt.crypto, had some very interesting characters in there. Look for the Cypherpunk's Manifesto to see the kinds of things that were being discussed back then. 

I left that world behind and started working in a corporate setting in '94. In 2013, my mother-in-law asked me to explain in simpler terms this Bitcoin thing she read about in the New Yorker. I read the article and did a ton of research to see what I had missed in the community. I was pissed that I missed the start of the whole thing.

I started getting ready to invest in 2014 when MTGOX imploded, causing the first of the huge crashes that gained global attention. I waited until I felt it bottomed out and started buying in early January, 2015. I even attended the North American Bitcoin Conference in Miami in 2015 where Ethereum made its grand entrance unto the world. 

I kept believing in it and following it and started automatically having my weekly travel expense reimbursement optionally paid in Bitcoin starting in 2016. Now I buy when the price is attractive and keep it in fiat when it is not. It just takes one click each time I submit my expenses for travel.

"Your drug arguments are mostly coming from the position that you should get to boss other people around who don't consent to having you be a master over them. You need to justify that position and you can't because it is unjustifiable. It involves aggression.

>For example no one has (or should have) the freedom to kill,

No shit, the Non aggression principle, nobody is ever arguing being an aggressor and murdering people is ok. Killing can be justified in self defense.

>That doesn’t mean I should give you my bank account info to prove a point because it’s not really relevant for you to know it and it puts me at risk

LOL you need to really think about your life and maybe cognitive dissonance.

>Having a side hustle also has nothing to do with needing privacy in your financials.

except you need to protect yourself from the being RICO robbed, or prosecuted by the state for engaging in mutually beneficial voluntary exchanges. You need financial privacy when cutting peoples hair without a license or selling homemade food or transporting cannabis. 

>in the circumstance of finances people have demonstrated endlessly that they will abuse the privilege when given

Oh yeah how is that, by having freedom to refuse your authoritarian aggressions?

>Cannabis related products are really the only strong use case provided, but global legislation is shifting on that by the end of the decade I imagine most countries will allow at least medical access

but all the people who are languishing with life in prison and all the people whose lives were destroyed by the drug war is completely moral and justified to you? It was wrong before now and will continue to be wrong to tell people what they can do with themselves in free and voluntary exchange and self ownership. You are starting from the position that it is somehow justified to destroy peoples lives just because it is law.

"Good point - legality is not morality, however immorality should not be enabled. Buying drugs that aren’t even approved for public consumption medicinally isn’t really a strong argument as best MDMA and psychedelics are still being used in trial phases. More often those drugs are not used for medicine and if they are it’s self administered rather than given by someone who has actual medical knowledge and experience. More commonly they are bought for resale and recreational use by -you guessed it - criminal enterprise. Having a side hustle also has nothing to do with needing privacy in your financials. 

Privacy, like freedom, is a concept. But just because you have them in some aspects doesn’t mean that in all respects it should be equally applied.  For example no one has (or should have) the freedom to kill, but, you should have freedom of speech and to vote. 

That is why I specifically stated financial privacy, Rather than say privacy of personal relationships because in the circumstance of finances people have demonstrated endlessly that they will abuse the privilege when given. Maybe one day people will be responsible but until then I’d like to do what O can to prevent the enabling of these things.

Cannabis related products are really the only strong use case provided, but global legislation is shifting on that by the end of the decade I imagine most countries will allow at least medical access 

My skin is in the game my financials are all tracked and reported and I pay my taxes on all the appropriate income. That doesn’t mean I should give you my bank account info to prove a point because it’s not really relevant for you to know it and it puts me at risk.

There are lots of good things that are illegal in many countries, like uncensored news, like medical treatments with psychedelics, MDMA or THC, like selling home cooked tamales because you can't earn a living wage and need a side hustle.

"At the risk of being downvoted into oblivion - If there’s one thing I’ve learned it’s that people don’t deserve freedom when it comes to privacy. 

You already have financial freedom - you can buy anything you want already - with the caveat that yeah some shit is very illegal. 

And what do people do with it? Buy child porn, traffic people, fund wars, and yes criminal enterprise. The only real value to privacy is to push to participate things you know you shouldn’t. The fact “dark money” is a thing illustrates that exact point. 

There’s a reason BTC was designed to be transparent - in fact that exact thing is part of what makes it better than regular cash.  It means being able to hold people and institutions accountable for the shit they pull. 

Otherwise why should anyone care? The average person already has their money tracked by a bank, Crypto is just an expansion on that to make it communal.

The exchange argument is going to go away as DEX's become more main stream and people transition to receiving their wages in digital currency.

"> One of the things on the other side of the argument is for example the fractional reserving of Bitcoin. 

That is possible as long as the owner trusts a custodian. But if he does, he doesn't understand the whole concept of Bitcoin. Bitcoin doesn't need a middle man for transactions. Deposited bitcoins can be claimed 24/7/365 at virtually no cost. Exchanges accused of running fractional reserve are at very high risk to go bankrupt in no time, therefore it might happen to a very small, insignificant degree only. 

> Gold, the big brother of Bitcoin failed, because they started to fractional reserve Gold by printing fiat instead. Then they started to not even trade Gold itself, but pieces of paper, that claims the owner of the papers to hold Gold. 

There were many reasons for that: gold could not be stored safely, it was not dividable into smaller units, it was not easily transferable. Gold notes took over the place of physical gold, because they could be stored safely with a custodian, could be divided into small units, could be transferred more easily (especially in the age of telecommunication). Abuse by custodians and naive trust of the public in medieval ages lead to fractional reserve banking. 

> Bitcoin has headed into the exact same direction and it will get worse. Most people put there Bitcoin at Exchanges, which are the new Banks with even less regulation then actual Banks, they arent audited, arent transparent, which can do whatever they want with the Bitcoin they have or dont have. 

Many exchanges are regulated already and they are more transparent than banks, since their true holdings show up on the blockchain.

> Any Exchange can collect a 100.000 actual real physical Bitcoin, but trade a million paper Bitcoin if they choose to.

Trades are usually small (you can look this up and this is very transparent). They might sum up at the end of the day to a big amount, but traders can trade as often as they want. This is pure capitalism and common on all other markets - nothing wrong here. The scale of corruption and abuse is way bigger on the regulated markets (insider trading, naked short selling = about 10% of all stocks in circulation were created through naked short selling and FTD, central bank manipulation aso.).

> As long as not everybody withdraws his Bitcoin from Exchanges at the same time, you can have a imagined cap of 21 million Bitcoin, while 100+ million paper Bitcoin are actually present.

Such a run on exchanges would lead to a supply shock. Assuming if your numbers are true (I would like to see some proof for it), this would mean a fractional reserve of 99.5%, while fiats run at reserve ratios from 10% down to 0%. 

> Today, only computer nerds, supporters of austrian economics and people who understand monetary policy are interested in Bitcoin. And even among that selective small knowledgeable crowd, only a small percentage actually hold real Bitcoin. The most gives it to fractional reserving exchanges and wallets.

This is just your biased opinion.

> If the large masses are supposed to come, you expect them to care about holding there own keys. They will care about playing there own Bank? Holding there wealth on a piece of paper under the pillow like in the middle ages? They are used to everything beeing done electronicly with 0 worry. They lose there twitter account, snapchat account, house keys, phones, passwords all the time. They will be perfectly fine even more so then the current hardcore crowd to give away all responsibility to the Exchanges.

That is like the prediction of Internet deniers who said, people will never trust a computer with they money, news, entertainment, commerce aso. The transition will happen slowly, but it will happen. 
 
> Gold has a rate of only 1 in 200 actually existing. A study has revealed that 95% of all Crypto market trading is completely fake. 

This is not specific to Bitcoin or crypto, it happens in all markets (even regulated markets).

> Aslong as they can fractional reserve Bitcoin through Exchanges and wallets, the scarcity, and 21 million cap is irrelevant and easily ignored fantasy number. And its time for Bitcoiners to get loud and angry about it.

Fractional reserve of Bitcoin is hardly possible, as I explained. It can never become a problem like in the fiat world.

> You can only imagine where the Price of Bitcoin would be today, if every single person would withdraw his Bitcoin from exchanges and custodial wallets.

Instead, each fiat currency that exists today emerged as a fractional representation of gold, which the world had previously converged upon as a monetary standard. None would subsist without the forces of government intervention; nor would any fiat currency have ever emerged if not for the prior existence (and limitations) of gold as a monetary medium. Modern monetary theorists and gold bugs alike will never admit it, but the calamity that is all fiat systems is nothing more than the manifestation of gold’s failure as a monetary medium. It is a dead man walking. The gold standard was formally abandoned in 1971, and the subsistence of jurisdictional fiat systems since then merely represents a transient departure from free market monetary forces. Modern fiat systems have only managed to survive as long as they have because a solution to the very problem created by fiat did not yet exist.

Gold, the big brother of Bitcoin failed, because they started to fractional reserve Gold by printing fiat instead. Then they started to not even trade Gold itself, but pieces of paper, that claims the owner of the papers to hold Gold. It is estimated that only 1 in 200 of Gold rate actually exists in the real world, the rest is all fractional reserving, paper Gold, digital Gold, fantasy Gold.

Good analysis so far. (to add: all fiat today is also a (temote) kind of paper gold, as it originates from being gold equivalent paper certificate before it was detached from gold by the power of states - most prominently on 15 Aug 1971).

But you shouldn't stop here for a balanced analysis but think further, long-term and fundamental.

Bitcoin is different to gold in many respects to offer very efficient counter measures against fractional reserve. Withdrawing botcoin is just one, but not the best. Proof of reserves can be made very easily by signatures only, without the need for moving a single bitcoin. Standardisable methodologies for such industry-wide practices have already been proposed and detailed many many years ago. Once bitcoin becomes more mainstream, such practices can become standard amongst all reputable centralized holders of btc like exchanges, banks, funds and alike. This way fractional reserve policies can be avoided.

What is particularly favourable about such mechanisms is that these proofs of reserve can be verified completely independently, and without needing to trust anybody, by every operator of a full bitcoin node, i.e. every single owner of a personal computer or raspberry pi with internet connection in the world.

All this is completely impossible with gold. There are some gold houses like ""bullionvault"" that do provide proof of reserves of their gold holdings by elaborate procedures involving physical auditing of gold vaults around the world, but there are a lot of actors that I as an end-customer have to trust, a lot of things could go wrong or get forged for such proofs of reserve.

So there is, a huge, a fundamental, difference between gold and bitcoin when it comes to the issue of fractional reserves.

>The article is written by the usual Bitcoin fanatic. Everything about Bitcoin is fantastic, everything about Bitcoin is perfect.
  
Parker Lewis has some good points, but although it's not a perfect article calling him a Fanatic is a strong term, coming from a person who clearly does not understand BTC as well as they think they do.  Your misconceptions are misguiding users here, so let's clarify things a bit in two posts...


>Bitcoin has headed into the exact same direction and it will get worse. Most people put there Bitcoin at Exchanges, which are the new Banks with even less regulation then actual Banks, they arent audited, arent transparent, which can do whatever they want with the Bitcoin they have or dont have. Any Exchange can collect a 100.000 actual real physical Bitcoin, but trade a million paper Bitcoin if they choose to.

The scenario you describe (Bitcoin centralization and debasing via fractional reserve) is not realistic. The main reason your argument is flawed at the core is that it starts with fallacy: the rough oversimplification that gold is *nearly the same* as bitcoin. 

The two do have many properties in common, but there are some key differences which make the fractional reserve endgame you imagine extremely unlikely, mostly because it requires a state of *high centralization*. 

Three properties of Bitcoin [vs gold] considerably make that state harder to reach:
**Portability, Verifiability and Censorship Resistance**. Let's have a look at each...


**1) Portability:** A fatal flaw of the gold standard was that the settlement in physical gold is cumbersome, expensive, and insecure, which meant it had to rely on centralizing physical gold reserves in a few locations—banks and central banks. Ultimately, this made gold vulnerable to being captured by governments (via confiscation or mere accumulation), leading to the temptations that inevitably resulted in the creation of money unbacked by physical gold.

Gold was always very hard to move and store, difficult to secure against loss or theft and allowing it to facilitate long-distance trade. When bullion is transferred between a buyer and a seller it is typically only the title to the gold that is transferred, not the physical bullion itself. Transmitting physical gold across large distances is costly, risky and time-consuming. 


Bitcoin is not limited in portability. Anyone can store millions of dollars of value themselves, something impractical with gold, and transmit them in a permisionless way, with almost instantaneous settlement, as well as carry them through airports or any similar scenarios without risk of confiscation. For the first time in the history of money, it is easy to bypass key entities throughout nearly the entire money life-cycle. This by itself highly reduces the tendency towards centralization, which is needed to boost out-of-control fractional reserves.

**In summary, Bitcoin is highly portable, while gold was not.**


**2) Verifiability:** Gold was difficult to verify, both in qualities and even in mere existence. Even today it is estimated that the reserves in central banks are partially inaccurately estimated, and even fake bars have been found in vaults. Once again this made gold more prone to centralization and capture as the average citizen not only had more difficult verifying his own ownership but also auditing that the their ""gold account"" at a bank actually had that value in it and wasn't just a promise.

Bitcoins, on the other hand can be verified with mathematical certainty, by anyone, at any time and without the need to be worried about possibly accepting a debased unit (unlike one getting gold of lower purity than expected). If one sends funds to an exchange or withdraws them, that settlement can be verified onchain with absolute certainty.

An Exchange can still obfuscate the real funds from a user, but it is now considerably easier to force them to demonstrate proof of reserves, as wallet transactions and balances can be verified in the public blockchain. 

Some exchanges perform proof-of-reserves voluntarily, while others do not. The latter can be forced to do it (via regulation or merely user pressure). One example of an exchange voluntarily doing this was Kraken, that proved 100% of its bitcoins are held in reserve. ([source](https://www.coindesk.com/krakens-audit-proves-holds-100-bitcoins-reserve))

And such cryptographically verifiable proof of reserves audits are absolute - unlike in the traditional financial system.

Now what about the ones that do not to it? Well, there are still two ways to force an exchange to supply proof of reserves - one is via regulation enforcement and the other is through peer pressure (bad rep to the industry helps no one) and customer pressure. The latter might seem inconsequential but it is not. Some investors like Trace Mayer have promoted the idea that users should remove their keys (i.e. coins) from the Exchanges periodically (Proof of Keys event). In the past this has been enough to unmask exchanges that were not holding the funds they claimed, eventually collapsing - this was for example at the heart of the demise of the QuadrigaCX Exchange, which was unable to settle enough withdrawals once users started requesting them.

Playing shenanigans with the reserves is much harder with Bitcoin, which brings cryptographic digital certainty to accounting and can help expose banks engaging in fractional reserve banking when we reach that stage.

**So in summary, Bitcoin is easily verifiable/auditable, gold was not.**

  

**3) Censorship resistance:** Gold's physical nature made it far more susceptible to state capture than Bitcoin, as history has shown. One way to do this would be to censor and block transactions considered undesirable, or even having the gold captured in the process (physically or via blocked IOUs). The owners had little or no options except finding alternatives and surrendering or getting rid of their gold.

In BTC the individual has sovereignty if he so wishes, having a degree of economic freedom which was not possible with gold. It is nearly impossible to censor and intercept a transaction sent between two independent nodes (that any user can run), which by itself  further lessens odds of capture by governments and centralization (although naturally some individuals will still delegate the management and storage of their wealth to third parties - but this time such is a choice, not an inevitability).


**So in summary, these three areas where BTC is very different from gold (Portability, Verifiability and Censorship Resistance) are by nature contrary to the need to rely on trust, reducing centralization and therefore making fractional reserve extremely hard to achieve at the scale you described.**

Will we still see some fractional happening? I believe we will in some scenarios. In the same way that the modern financial system has  banks creating money whenever they engage in lending, there will be a time when Bitcoin will be used as collateral and offered in fairly traditional loans. Banks that will survive in the long run might be offering some financial instruments 100% backed by Bitcoin. Different banks can have different policies, some more aggressive, some more conservative. Some might be fractional reserve while others may be 100% Bitcoin backed, with varying interest rates.

These services are only starting to appear now, so perhaps we'll see banks misbehaving again at later stages, tolerated by regulators.

The key difference however, is that this time, such is voluntary to the lenders, savers and borrowers; any individual who does not want to surrender their BTC to a bank or exchange, will not have to do so, especially due to the three properties we talked about earlier. Before BTC there were not many alternatives, and in the age of gold that helped its demise.

**Fractional reserve will inevitably happen in Bitcoin, but that will not be a considerable problem. In fact, in some scenarios it will be useful to establish it as the new standard, as it allows a set of product offerings that the current financial industry supplies and some customers wouldn't mind having. But this time it's different - we are able to keep track of it in a way that was never possible before.**";8;1;False;beowulfpt;fg6qzy0;"Fidelity, a company with 2.46 Trillion USD under management, just shared an article called ""Bitcoin Obsoletes All Other Money""";ewv949;https://twitter.com/DigitalAssets/status/1223306849275076608?s=19

You're 100% correct with this, but your solution comes from the wrong perspective. You don't ignore Bitcoin, you increase the number of computer nerds, economists and people who understand monetary policy.

If everyone is educated to understand monetary policy and the risks of fractional reserve, and everyone understands the solution Bitcoin is offering, but they still choose to hold a fractionally reserved equivalent, all you can do is shrug.

"To truly answer that question would take a very long time, but here is the short version:

First lets look at Fiat in totality then at digital fiat and cash respectively.

Fiat in totality:

1. Provides state actors the abiliy to steal wealth via monetary inflation  by 'printing' as much fiat as they choose and debasing the value of the notes in our pocket.
2. Varies in strength from nation to nation, usually depending on the monetary policies of the respective governments, this generates great wealth disparity between nations. (Argentina, Venezuala, Zimbabwe it's a long list...)
3. Fiat monetary policies are unpredictable, being set by everything from unelected secretive committee's (like the Fed, try listing the shareholders of that particular organisation!) to tin pot dictators or Donalt Trumps tweets!
4. Provides (and most would agree encourages) very short term thinking by the setting of monetary policy by politicians that only have an eye on the next election cycle.
5. Supports the debt based economy via fractional reserve banking, an evil in itself.

&#x200B;

Digital Fiat:

1. Excludes a large portion of the worlds population from the economic system since they don't have access to bank accounts (Another true evil).
2. Allows extra-judicial powers to be wielded against organisations not liked by encombant politiclal powers. eg the pressuring of paypal to stop allowing payments to Wikileaks.
3. Allows international economic castration (justified or not it shouldn't be an option) such America's suspension of Iran's Fed account or threats to disconnect nations from the Swift banking network!
4. Requires access to digital banking with all the KYC/AML state sponsored totalitarian monitoring that enables!
5. Requires most digital wealth to be held by 'trusted third parties' such as banks, which as we all now know, cannot be trusted at all, EVER!

&#x200B;

Fiat Cash:

1. Just loved by anyone that needs to store illicit wealth or commit illicit/illegal trancations. Totally untraceable.
2. Frequently forged.
3. Cannot be transmitted over the internet.
4. Cannot be used in most foreign countries so has to be exchanged to local currencies allowing rent seeking behaviour by exchanges ie 4-5%.
5. Carrying any significant amount invites risk of physical violence to part with it

This is a bit of a Luddite argument. 

I know at least three persons who are not ""nerds"" and have very limited knowledge of the economy, the technology and the overall game theory. And yet they moved a part of their savings to BTC and now hold the keys in simple-to-use hardware wallets. They understood that the sovereignty they now have comes at a cost and are willing to be responsible with their funds in return for what they're getting.

In the same way, the overall user experience in BTC (which is still atrocious in some areas) has been improving at a very fast pace. UXs are getting better and there is more and more abstraction from the core protocols. 

I have lived the early days of the Internet, when something as simple as sending a file in an email (or even just a the text email for that matter) was cumbersome and truly complicated - today, my mother can do it from a phone with a couple of taps, completely unaware of TCP/IP or SMTP or any other protocol particulars running under the hood.   


Bitcoin is heading that way (maybe not fast enough, but it's accelerating), with better wallets, better key management in both onchain settlement and upper layer features like micropayments (Lightning wallets, etc). 

There is still a lot to be done, but the progress is clear. Saying ""things are difficult now, so it will never become mainstream"" shows a total lack of vision. Focus on where the ball is going, not where it is at the moment.



> A study has revealed that 95% of all Crypto market trading is completely fake. Aslong as they can fractional reserve Bitcoin through Exchanges and wallets, 

This old report by Bitwise was later discredited as exaggerated,as it mostly focused in shady small exchanges no one should be using anyway. The top 10 exchanges do not fake volume or engage in washtrading. A later study by Chainalysis analyzed the top 10 (including Binance, Bitfinex, Kraken, Bitstamp, Coinbase, BitFlyer, Gemini, itBit, Bittrex, and Poloniex) and concluded they report their actual volumes and are not wash trading.

Some exchanges are still practicing misreporting, but they are being weeded out by better analytics and increases in both peer and government pressure. Personally, I think this is a **non-issue** because it's becoming considerably harder to do it without being spotted (and there is growing reputational and financial risk at stake). As with usability, the more the market matures, the harder it will be to be a bad actor for long without being singled out.


> the scarcity, and 21 million cap is irrelevant and easily ignored fantasy number.


Far from a fantasy number. The consensus rules are clear (including things like block emission time, sizes and other limits), the protocol/code is both auditable and stable and it is becoming more ossified as time goes by (a bit as what happened with TCP/IP and IPv4>6 transition being a good example of how hard it is to change after network effect and ossification are strong.

People tend to confuse the ease of changing the code (which is very simple) and the ease of getting all the players to accept your changes (which is extremely hard). The 21M limit is not secured by code or hardware, it is mostly secured by the social consensus and game theory. If someone deviates from that, the players/network reject it and will reject your blocks and transactions... you'll end up isolated, forking a coin - it's no longer BTC.    


> You can only imagine where the Price of Bitcoin would be today, if every single person would withdraw his Bitcoin from exchanges and custodial wallets.

That is irrelevant for the USD/BTC rate. The value of a bitcoin is the same, regardless of the private key being owned by the user or the exchange. Value is determined by certain factors (a whole thread by itself) but not by where the private keys are stored.

"One thing this article misses in its road map to bitcoin world domination is a 4th, never-talked-about property of money: **security**. Money that is scarce, easily divisible, and easily transferable is worthless if someone can easily take it from you without your consent. 

So this prompts the question: Is bitcoin more easily secured than any other form of money? 

The answer is yes, and is another point on the scoreboard for bitcoin. Physical assets or notes need to either be hidden in a place no one else can find it, locked away behind a security system no one else can get through, or both. Bitcoin on the other hand has more options. 

If you don't need to worry about bricking those coins after you're death, you can safely carry around a hardware wallet (or multisig wallet with a hardware wallet component) with millions of dollars of bitcoin on it through airports or in crowded public spaces in a 3rd world country filled with thieves. You could never do such a thing easily with millions of dollars worth of gold or paper currency. 

If you do want your coins to be inheritable if you die (and lose any passphrases in your head), you do have to physically secure the seeds, but you can use multisig to require that multiple physical locations need to be breached in order to steal your funds. In the future, when there are convenants, [bitcoin vaults](http://hackingdistributed.com/2016/02/26/how-to-implement-secure-bitcoin-vaults/) can make it even easier to store bitcoin safely and conveniently at the same time.

Such things are impossible to do with any form of money other than cryptocurrency.";1;0;False;fresheneesz;fg7b39p;"Fidelity, a company with 2.46 Trillion USD under management, just shared an article called ""Bitcoin Obsoletes All Other Money""";ewv949;https://twitter.com/DigitalAssets/status/1223306849275076608?s=19

"The article is written by the usual Bitcoin fanatic. Everything about Bitcoin is fantastic, everything about Bitcoin is perfect. Everything about everything else is bad. There are no risks, no flaws, pages of pages looking only at only one side of the argument.

One of the things on the other side of the argument is for example the fractional reserving of Bitcoin. Gold, the big brother of Bitcoin failed, because they started to fractional reserve Gold by printing fiat instead. Then they started to not even trade Gold itself, but pieces of paper, that claims the owner of the papers to hold Gold. It is estimated that only 1 in 200 of Gold rate actually exists in the real world, the rest is all fractional reserving, paper Gold, digital Gold, fantasy Gold.

Bitcoin has headed into the exact same direction and it will get worse. Most people put there Bitcoin at Exchanges, which are the new Banks with even less regulation then actual Banks, they arent audited, arent transparent, which can do whatever they want with the Bitcoin they have or dont have. Any Exchange can collect a 100.000 actual real physical Bitcoin, but trade a million paper Bitcoin if they choose to.

Aslong as not everybody withdraws his Bitcoin from Exchanges at the same time, you can have a imagined cap of 21 million Bitcoin, while 100+ million paper Bitcoin are actually present.

Today, only computer nerds, supporters of austrian economics and people who understand monetary policy are interested in Bitcoin. And even among that selective small knowledgeable crowd, only a small percentage actually hold real Bitcoin. The most gives it to fractional reserving exchanges and wallets.

If the large masses are supposed to come, you expect them to care about holding there own keys. They will care about playing there own Bank? Holding there wealth on a piece of paper under the pillow like in the middle ages? They are used to everything beeing done electronicly with 0 worry. They lose there twitter account, snapchat account, house keys, phones, passwords all the time. They will be perfectly fine even more so then the current hardcore crowd to give away all responsibility to the Exchanges.

Gold has a rate of only 1 in 200 actually existing. A study has revealed that 95% of all Crypto market trading is completely fake. Aslong as they can fractional reserve Bitcoin through Exchanges and wallets, the scarcity, and 21 million cap is irrelevant and easily ignored fantasy number. And its time for Bitcoiners to get loud and angry about it.

"Coinbase includes transfers from and to other wallets in that total. If you send bitcoin to another network address, that amount gets included in the total, but it is not a taxable event. Neither as a gain nor deductible as a loss. 

They do that because they don’t know what happened to the crypto when you send it away. Did it get spent, sold, exchanged for another crypto? All taxable so they include transfers even if you just moved it to a hardware wallet.

- Code that is complex but changes rarely is the ""long tail"" something that you don't have to work with often so it can be ignored. (I personally interested in behavioral code analysis because of this, as I have a tendency to keep refactoring code I would never touch otherwise.)

Thus refactoring efforts could be concentrated to those very few places where complex code tends to change often, while ignoring the long tail.

"At a high level, I think it's pretty clear how it can be done.

There would still be per-input scriptSigs (well, witness stacks now), but there could be a variant of OP_CHECKSIG that does not consume a signature off the stack, and also never fails. Instead, it would compute the message it would expect a signature with, and consume a public key, and remember those. Per-input validation doesn't return (false or true) anymore, but (false or (list of (msg,pubkey) pairs)). All those pairs get combined at the transaction level, and verified against a single signature (which would just be in the first input or so).

The complications are not fundamental problems, just engineering. For example, what if a softfork adds more places that can contain OP_CHECKSIGs (e.g. by changing execution flow, or by adding a new signature-checking opcode). In that case old and new nodes would disagree about the list of pubkey/msg pairs that script execution produced, and at most one can match the provided signature. To avoid a fork, such softforks would need to be carefully engineered to have two aggregate signature per transaction, one for all the checksigs visible to the old code, and one for the rest.

"Personally, I agree with you.

I also have urged people to move forward on known-needed simple bug fix soft-forks such as https://github.com/TheBlueMatt/bips/blob/cleanup-softfork/bip-XXXX.mediawiki to exercise the process again and build confidence that there will either be no problems or any that arise can be handled via ordinary effort.

You can see, for example, that lack of confidence showing up whenever people ask Pieter about taproot activation and he essentially wants to wash his hands of questions related to that.

"Taproot depends on key aggregation being available to wallets for usefulness. Cross-input aggregation is just an efficiency gain on top.

The large difference is that key aggregation (have one public key on chain which represents the agreement of multiple parties, which needs one signature for the aggregated key to spend) is done on the wallet side, without the consensus rules needing to even be aware of its existence (and, for privacy reasons, preferably aren't aware).

Cross-input aggregation however is something that needs explicit support at consensus. It enables spending multiple UTXOs in one transaction, and only having a single signature for all of them at once.

> and the analysis on Bitcoin Core shows colossal amount of technical debt being built up

uh. is that tool calling something technical debt literally because it's just an area which has received a lot of changes?  That seems... ill advised.

In Bitcoin core the repeated changes are often 'refactoring', which is its own problem but one opposite to the tool's idea of what is going on.

>  In some cases such RPC user space breaking seems completely unreasonable

On one hand for a long time bitcoin core held back useful improvements to avoid changing the RPC interface and I think it went too far. Now it's a little more common for changes to happen but put the old behavior behind a temporary command line option.  That seems like a reasonable compromise, although it isn't totally effortless for you or your users.

There are a large amount of changes with no functional impact. I don't personally think that that the mix of changes being made now provides a good cost/benefit mix and that's one of the things that has made the project unenjoyable to work on for me. Before I stopped contributing I pushed for it being made the norm that pull requests should explicitly articulate their benefit to the user, but it didn't really seem to help.

E.g. that there is a pattern where a change that changes behavior (e.g. in order to improve the experience for users) gets little review because reviewing a real change is hard (it could have subtle implications, like breaking nbitcoin's use of the api!), and in the meantime the change eclipsed by 101 little refactoring changes that get reviewed and approved very quickly because their non-effect is obvious.  Eventually the author gets tired of tossing code into the void, the substantive change falls behind on being rebased against the constantly shifting refactors and gets closed by a bot, or by a human acting like one. 

The change you mentioned specifically is https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13008

On one hand I can see how one could argue that this is a uselessly breaking pointless cosmetic change.  On the other hand, it also a bug fix (use of size for a vsize could result in mistaken behavior like paying inappropriate fees) and it was given a temporary depreciation override so users could get the old behavior back in 0.19.

It also got covered in release notes, although the release note was incomplete (didn't mention getblockchaininfo though it was changed too) and as a result somewhat misleading.

If you used Bitcoin Core more like you used tor-- e.g. just communicated with it over the P2P port-- you would also have next to zero maintenance work; so I don't think that's an apt comparison.

I don't think expecting the interface to be completely compatible in major releases is a reasonable ask. At most, the ask should be that the changes in established and stable interfaces are for a clear and articulated benefit, that as much backwards compatibility be provided as reasonably possible (like the ""-deprecatedrpc=size"" being provided to temporarily get the old behavior back), that the change be well documented, and that you have opportunity to update before the less sophisticated users get ahold of it (e.g. via the long RC cycle of the software). Otherwise any time an mistake was made that was RPC-visible it would be stuck there-- talk about technical debt.

What I think could have been done better there is making the release note more comprehensive about the change.  I'm debating saying it would have also been better to add ""vsize"" first for a couple releases before removing size as it would have reduced the burden on your code to handle both... the problem with that is that the ""size"" parameter name was just wrong. OTOH, it doesn't look like there is any known case of it causing an issue. You could also develop a practice in your codebase of testing against new major releases while they're in RC, or even test against bitcoin git in CI.  It can stink to get slaved to other project's development, but new major releases are fairly predictable, quite infrequent, and the RC cycle is fairly long.

The alternative to there sometimes being breaking changes in the RPC is that actual improvements just can never get made because they might break something somewhere for someone and even more of the projects efforts would be directed into internally-cosmetic changes that don't make the software or system better for users. Actual improvements are *always* visible by their very nature after all. I don't think that would be better. In fact, I think it's already a major problem for the project.

The annoying thing about problems is that their opposites can also be problems at the same time.

When you find cases where the project tripped you up, you should open an issue as a ""FYI"" just to make sure that people working on things understand the impact. It might encourage increased diligence in areas that could have saved you effort without otherwise having a cost (e.g. making sure that release note was complete).";6;2;False;nullc;fg74g1d;?WHY is Cross-input signature aggregation (the feature that would potentially improve (and incentivize) Bitcoin's privacy) not included in the Schnorr/Taproot proposal.;ewruud;https://twitter.com/pwuille/status/1221478264071307264

Insurance? You are insuring what exactly? Insurance is a means of protection from financial loss. After you traded your goods, services or payable financial instruments for Bitcoins you lost your valuable possessions and became the holder of a record whose issuers pays you nothing. You became the holder of something that you can't eat, drink, drive,... or use as a raw material to build it into finished products. So, by holding Bitcoins you are already at loss and there's nothing to be insured.;1;1;False;Expensive-Button;fg5v6qk;The Empirical Proof of Bitcoin's Real Value Being Zero;ewqyue;https://youtu.be/WSYTXmxPveY
"The goalposts is sound money, which has value for different people for different reasons.

For me Bitcoin is like insurance. A life insurance is also just a record in a database. It doesn't give you dividends. It is useful only when shit happens. For me it is an insurance against my country being run by idiots that ruin the economy and make me flee to a different country at an old age. I know that in the other country there will also be young people who are afraid whatever happened to my country would happen to theirs, so they will work for me for my Bitcoin (at least half as hard as I worked for it). Why wouldn't they invent a new altcoin instead of working for my bitcoin? That's mostly a cultural psychological matter - if they flee to a new country with that altcoin instead of bitcoin, the people in the new country (who already don't like immigrants) will think they were unfair to use an altcoin instead of bitcoin, and refuse working for them.

For others, it's a way to cheat the tax authorities - transact between people who don't fully trust each other yet don't want to work with a bank and pay for taxes for every transaction. I don't do that, but it makes me certain that the price of Bitcoin will not drop too much, because the criminals will need it, so it makes it better for me as an insurance.

For others, it's a way to fight tyrants, who freeze bank accounts of  opposition activists.  For others, it's a way to buy things online without their spouses know about it.

Bitcoin is not an investment. It's the product itself: freedom, privacy, safe store-of-value, for whatever trade you plan in the future. It's like gold used to be, but for the 21st century.

Do you also think that gold is worthless? What if I told you that you can buy gold at nearly 1/50 of its current price?

Yes, Bitcoin pays nothing and that's why it is ponzi-like. On their own, all financial instruments are worthless paper or digital records.

You can restore the seed on multiple devices or systems as long as each is safe. If it is exposed on any unsafe system then it is unsafe everywhere. It only needs to be exposed (even potentially so) once to be unsafe to use anywhere. The seed is used to generate keys. If it gets compromised on any device then those keys can be generated by a thief in Timbuktu and it won't matter how safe your other device is - having the seed nullifies all other safe storage of it.

">The point is that Bitcoin's delayed confirmation is essential to its decentralization

Agreed...

>and that makes it more suitable for online commerce

Disagreed.  That makes base-layer payments more suitable for online commerce, but only barely.  Commerce of any kind is too ""chatty"" for storing in a global permanent ledger.  There are simply too many transactions happening for a ledger to hold any significant or meaningful amount of commercial activity directly, whether ""online"" of offline.

That's why future commerce will increasingly switch to second layer technologies, leaving the base layer as primarily an abstraction layer for higher layers with the occasional high-value transfer carried out directly.

In these early days, we've been able to ""abuse"" the chain by treating Bitcoin Transactions as essentially the same thing as human transactions, but the reality is that they're not.  A Bitcoin transaction is a ledger entry and represents the signing over of one or more values to any entity able to provide a solution to match a particular value.

"Most would still say this is one of BTCs biggest flaws the fact it is no way private enough from prying eyes 👀.

What they should have put their efforts into is making all Bitcoins go through coin join, that way exchanges or others wouldn’t be able to taint those coins or accounts that have used coin join.

If those exchanges don’t like the idea they could always cease trading which in a whole would make BTC again what is was meant to be a pure peer to peer network.

You mention state control of the monetary system. That's exactly what bitcoin is designed to subvert. And its not experimental, there are billion dollar companies built to handle it, multi-billion dollar markets. It's a real thing, it works.

If you choose not to PARTICIPATE after being this close, you are doing yourself a huge disservice. Take $500, spend a day doing research, and put some bitcoin in a wallet you control. Remove that $500 of value from state control.

"Bitcoin has gone through three major “bubble” cycles that average about 4 years apart. Being about 2 years from the previous top, most people think it’ll hit a new top in 1-3 years from now; a big driver of this prediction is the halving in a few months. The last 2 ATH “bubbles” have come 1-2 years after the corresponding halving.

The landscape is a little different now than previous cycles. Some people think it may take less time to reach a new ATH this time around, but others see things that make them think it may take longer to hit a new ATH this cycle.

Given the huge upside of Bitcoin, why not just keep a small amount for a year or two?

\- Before it's confirmed, Bob spends from it, sending 100 sats back to Alice (provided Alice sends it to Carol, i.e. Lightning)

\- Alice's 1000 sat payment to Bob still hasn't settled yet, but now only 900 of those 1000 sats belong to Bob, so his risk is lowered

That said, you are also correct. If instead of the above, Bob locks up 1000 of his own sats with Alice, then the risk is reversed, and Alice is taking on a 100 sat risk as soon as she accepts the Lightning payment from the unconfirmed channel.";2;1;False;RubenSomsen;fg593a5;Question about Lightning and number of confirmations;ewisgh;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ewisgh/question_about_lightning_and_number_of/

">Right and the theory there is that if the bank can give its people a loan, it will create more innovation than would otherwise exist. Theres a lot of logic to it but the question is do we need the loans. Are they actually helping? How long can it go on? Forever? Is it doing more harm than good?

As long as they lend out money they actually have then I don't see a problem. 

>Will people choose a system that no one controls over a system that some people control more than they do? 

No people will choose whichever is the most convenient. E.g. Card over cash. Cash over gold etc...
