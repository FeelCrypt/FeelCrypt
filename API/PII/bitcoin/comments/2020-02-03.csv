"Bitcoin involves sending lots of data between nodes, and if you let blocks grow at the rate of storage price drop, with no regard for the rate at which communications channels increase in capacity, there's a good chance you exert a centralizing pressure on bitcoin.

Bitcoin validation has to be something which anyone with access to a fairly minimal level of internet connection can do, or it stops being censor-resistant. If anything, it's much too resource-intensive already.

If and when it's safe & necessary to do so, I think most bitcoiners would support a(nother) block size increase.

A tldr; version:

The idea of money is abstract and it has been changing back and forth from commodity money (gold, silver) to debt based money managed by churches, kings and politicians. In our current day money system, the idea of money is like a no limit credit card that allows the current day politicians to borrow from infinite future. When they borrow this much credit from future, a few people will actually own the important assets and the rest of the society will have to live with debt. 

Bitcoin offers a competing alternate money system which works like gravity. bitcoin is implemented by a network of computers talking to each other keeping track of who owns the existing bitcoins. It does not know anything about the owner or discriminates against the user. There will only be 21 million bitcoins ever. Having a money that is not political will put back the power of decision making into the hands of individuals, families and local communities instead of centralized institutions.

"First thing to do is look back and record the date and price of Bitcoin for each time you purchased. This is your ""cost basis"" If you've held for more than a year, all of your sales will be considered Long Term capital gains, and will range from 15%-20%. If you sell within 365 days from when you bought, it will be considered and taxed as ordinary income (much higher than capital gains. So it's beneficial to hold for more than a year, obviously.

"Not incentivizing wasteful spending isn't the same as dis-incentivizing useful spending. People spend when they value the purchase more than the savings. Central banks have lied to you.

"A good practical example of the difference: Go find some buildings in your town (ie old bank or courthouse) that was built during gold period (pre-1971)....Then go look at modern building being built. 

Notice the difference? Commodity money forces you to build things that last for 100 years because money has real value...in monopoly money era everything is built as cheap possible using disposable particle board and sheetrock.

"The biggest problem is if you use the wrong address, usually because you pasted the wrong address. This could be because of human error or malware can change the clipboard contents.

The first 4-5 digits will confirm it's the correct address. Every digit checked makes it less likely it's a lookalike.

That's where the final digits come in. They're a checksum. So, even if an adversary found an address that started with the same n characters, there's no way it could ever finish with the same checksum. For even one digit difference, the checksum would be completely different.

Therefore check the first 4-5 characters and the last 4-5. If they match as expected then the chance of it being a 'similar' address are negligible.

"You seem to confuse exchanges with wallets (it's not clear what you mean by ""app"" exactly - an app is just a software).  

In general, it's better to keep bitcoin on a wallet which gives you access to the private key. This means, you and you alone have full control of the coins. An exchange like Coinbase etc do **not** give you full control of the coins. You have to ask them when you want to move coins in or out, and they can refuse you service, or ask to provide personal details and so on, before they give you your coins.  

You should pick a wallet which lets you control your own coins, although this comes with some level of responsibility (backing up properly).  

Some of the generally recommended wallets are:  

> Hardware wallet (highest security): [Trezor](https://trezor.io),  Ledger [Nano S](https://www.ledger.com), [Coldcard](https://coldcardwallet.com)  

> Desktop wallet: [Electrum](https://electrum.org/#home), [Wasabi](https://wasabiwallet.io)

"Short answer: No, you aren’t late.

Long answer: It depends on the adoption. If bitcoin continues its current trajectory, >100k BTC is absolutely within possibility. 

Because crypto is a new asset class entirely, it’s hard to accurately compare it to other assets, but for example, Golds market capitalization is estimated to be 2.5 trillion dollars. Bitcoin is like 170 billion...

So imagine Bitcoins value proposition carries it upto even half of Gold Market Capitalization. That’s pretty much 10x it’s current value. 

Now given the true scarcity of bitcoin versus the discovered scarcity of Gold; it can be argued that Bitcoin will continue trending upward in value (over the long-term)

"Adding to this good explaination:

Nodes also have privacy benefits because most other kinds of wallet query a third-party server to get their balance and history, which means that server can spy on them. Full nodes avoid this because they download the entire blockchain and scan it locally for their own transaction.

Technically nodes don't have to be a ledger of all transactions. Pruning mode can be enabled where the old transactions are deleted after they've been verified.

"I would add that Bitcoin (and all cryptocurrency) has one major downside: **Every txn that goes in the blockchain has to be stored and validated by all users forever**.

To prevent the resource costs of connecting to the network from spiraling out of control, we put a tight constraint on the capacity for this type of txn. But what if there was a way to change ownership that does not require any updates to the blockchain while retaining Bitcoin's trust guarantees?

The Lightning Network is such a solution. It allows users to control a single unspent coin, and update their respective equity of that coin as many times as they want in private. These shared coins are called **payment channels**.

Imagine A and B open a channel together and they both put in 1 BTC. That channel has 2 BTC and starts with a configuration of (1,1).  If A wants to send half a bitcoin to B, they simply update it to (0.5, 1.5), and so on.

These changes are trustless because both A and B can **unilaterally publish the most recent update to the blockchain** and withdraw their share of the coin.

The LN is a whole **network of payment channels**. So you can transact with people you don't have a channel with, assuming there is some route that connects them to the channels you already have.

What's neat about payment channels is that ownership changes no longer need to be published on the base layer, because they don't create a new coin. Posting to the blockchain is only necessary when a new coin has to be created, e.g. when you deposit to or withdraw from the LN.

Since ownership updates are not included in blocks and are only between two parties, they are basically instant as well.";5;1;False;Hasu_Research;fgfapst;Mentor Monday, February 03, 2020: Ask all your bitcoin questions!;ey5ijv;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ey5ijv/mentor_monday_february_03_2020_ask_all_your/

"The LN is a p2p network, on top of Bitcoin network.

"Question about transaction accountability and plausible deniability - this is one thing I have always wondered is about. Consider this situation. I want to transfer BTC to another entity.

I could see in a few minutes, the correct amount moving from my address to theirs.

What is to stop the ""receiving"" entity from claiming they never received the BTC, and when challenged with the public transaction reaching the specified address, they claim that was not the address they provided. Since transactions are permanent and final, seems like these types of shenanigans would happen all the time, because it would be word vs word in most cases.

It also gives you a better protection of your privacy on the bitcoin network. There are different ways to set it up.  

A popular one is to do it on a dedicated, cheap device such as Raspberry Pi so it can run 24/7 (it doesn't have to though) and not interference with your usual computer work. Here are two guides, f.ex: [RaspiBolt](https://stadicus.github.io/RaspiBolt/), [RaspiBlitz](https://github.com/rootzoll/raspiblitz) (you can just skip the Lightning parts if you only want the Bitcoin Core node part).  


Here is a good explainer by P. Wuille what a node is useful for (although it doesn't touch on the privacy aspect):  


> One of Bitcoin's strengths - the most important in my opinion even - is the low degree of trust you need in others.   
>  
>    
> If you use a full node for your incoming transactions, you know that there was no cheating anytime in the history of your coins:  
>  
> * Nobody ever created money out of nothing (except for mimers, and only according to a well-defined schedule).  
> 
> * Nobody ever spent coins without holder their private key.  
> 
> * Nobody spent the same coins twice (but see further).  
> 
> * Nobody violated any of the other tricky rules that are needed to keep the system in check (difficulty, proof of work, DoS protection, ...).  
> 
> ... with one exception: because there is a need to pick a winner in presence of multiple competing valid versions of the ledger, (a majority of) miners have the authority to pick the version of the block chain that wins. This means their power is limited to choosing the order in which otherwise valid transactions occur, up to and including the right to delay them indefinitely. But they cannot make invalid transaction look valid to a full node.  
>  
> If you are not running a full node, the amount of trust you're placing in others increases.  
> 
> SPV nodes (such as some mobile clients, and Multibit) place a blind trust in the majority of miners, without checking validity of the blockchain they produce. It still requires a majority of miners to mislead an SPV node, but they can make it believe anything (including ""You received 10000000 BTC!""). The reason why this does not happen is because full nodes would not accept such blocks, and assuming a large portion of the ecosystem does rely on full nodes, miners who do this would not see their blocks accepted by the larger economy, resulting in them wasting money.  
>  
> Centralized services (most webwallets) make the user trust whatever the site says. They can claim anything.
>  
> So I hope you now see the importance of full nodes in this model. If you run a full node somewhere on the network, and nobody looks at the transactions it validates, it is indeed contributing to the network, but it is not helping with the reduction of trust.  
>  
> Look at it another way: if only a few large players in the Bitcoin ecosystem were running full nodes, it only requires a malicious intent, or an attack/threat against them, to change the system's rules, as nobody else is validating.  
>  
> Doing transactions in the Bitcoin ecosystem helps the Bitcoin currency. Running a full node helps the network. Using a full node helps you and the ecosystem reduce the need for trust.

"A node is just a ledger of all the Bitcoin transactions, and an enforcer that verifies which transactions are legit and follow the rules or not. The system needs nodes so that everyone is keeping track and enforcing the rules of the Bitcoin network. 

It benefits the owner because when you use Bitcoin you can use your own node and verify everything yourself. If you use Bitcoin without using your own node, you are actually using someone else's node and trusting them. So it's better to use your own.

* Apple stock is purely a store of value because you can't directly exchange 0.002% of its value for groceries at Walmart.
* Gold is purely a store of value because you can't shave a portion off to pay for your gas.

Bitcoin has the highest market cap and is the best known of all cryptos. You kind of need these things first, before the rest can come. A currency must first store value, before it can be used as a medium of exchange. na-- is technically a far superior crypto, in speed and cost for transactions, but the value and total market cap just goes down and down. If your coin's total market cap is 80 million, and few crypto users even know what it is, (and no nocoiners), HOW could it ever be used for RL transactions, when no one has it, beyond a few whales ? Its a pure chicken and egg problem. You can't have a marketplace without lots of holders, and you won't have any holders, unless the market cap goes up in the long term. Its not impossible that we might first adopt Bitcoin, then all the nocoiners get together and create or choose a new coin that better reflects their wants and desires, once everyone is aware of crypto's clear advantages. Inflation Coin ? Mints an amount of new coins each year to cover the US budget deficit ? I could see all the normies voting for that as the nation's currency.

"High free would make retail transactions pretty worthless, but let's size see what Bitcoin is up against. 

You also should consider how long it takes to turn an apple stock into something you can buy coffee with. You have to sell it (apple market orders are usually under a minute, but lower volume stock can take minutes to hours) and you have to transfer funds to your bank before make a debit card transaction. The bank transfer can take days depending on your brokerage and bank.

If you use a credit card, this gets simpler because you can borrow the money to spend, so the times aren't really relevant.

As for the cost of the transaction, etrade usually charges 7 USD. You don't usually pay the debit fees, but the Fed reports they are about. Debit card transactions are 0.8% to 1.5% plus some extra per transaction. Credit cards are more like 1.5% - 3%. 

So, for 1 apple stock (about 300 USD) , you are waiting 3 days and paying at least 9 USD. 

Right now Bitcoin is about .80 cents per transaction. Even if that 300 USD was in 10 transactions, Bitcoin wins. Lightening makes it crazy efficient. I'm pretty sure lightening beats out debit cards hands down.

When you step outside of retail transactions and start talking about transferring thousands of dollars (buying real estate for example), since network fees are flat and traditional means are usually a percent of the transaction, I don't think it will matter much.";16;1;False;duckofdeath87;fgg0ojz;“Is bitcoin a store of value or a medium of exchange?” Me:;ey412i;https://i.redd.it/65yybw106oe41.jpg

"One problem when using a custodial wallet to pay someone (in this instance, to deposit at Coinbase) is that you have no control over the transaction.

Let's say there's a rally occurring and everyone is transferring bitcoin to and from (or between) exchanges or whatever.  And transaction fees are hard to estimate.  

So your withdrawal from Cash App is stuck ... for hours, .... because the fee was too low.  Cash App cannot (or won't) do anything about it.

If you withdrew to your own wallet where you own the keys, you could at least do a CPFP transaction.

There's the fee bumping method known as child-pays-for-parent (CPFP). If you send a transaction and the fee was too low, you can spend the ""change"" transaction but double up the fee required. This will cause the miners to look at both transactions as a set, and the combined fees should then be high enough to get both confirmed.  CPFP also can be done if you are the recipient of the funds.

- https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Fee_bumping

And then let's say you send to Coinbase, but your wallet didn't pay enough of a fee.  If your wallet supports (and has enabled) RBF, you could at least bump the fee that way too.

If you are using a wallet that supports [replace-by-fee](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Replace_by_fee) (RBF), and have it enabled before creating your send transaction, you can feel comfortable going on the lower-end of the transaction fee range. If the transaction doesn't confirm soon enough for you, you simply bump the fee using RBF.

*Wallets supporting RBF*

- https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/b8qf4c
- https://bitcoinops.org/en/compatibility/#replace-by-fee-rbf


And those are reasons just related to fees and confirmation speed.

There's also financial privacy to consider.

Coinbase behaves terribly.   They perform chain analysis, and will freeze accounts based on what you do with the coins from Coinbase, or what the person did with your coins you used to deposit.

Let's say Cash App were to not do Chainanalysis and simply pays out from their hot wallet.   So some other Cash App customer sells on a dark market to an undercover agent and then deposits their coins at Cash App.   Those coins  then are what Cash App uses to pay you.

In that instance, as far as Coinbase is concerned, you received the dope seller's coins, and thus they could freeze your account.

Sure, you might (eventually) convince them you were not involved in illicit activity, ... but who needs that hassle?

Learn to use your own wallet, ... learn to coinjoin (or perform other methods that maintain your financial privacy), and learn to \#DELETECOINBASE.

"So some guy or guys 10 years ago decided to make a network that would be supported and ran by people (computers) who join it. Think of it as a basically a ledger, meaning a book where people’s transactions are written down. The point of making it the way it was made was that to add or remove a transaction, all (well almost) users would have to agree with it. This is called decentralization and it’s the main selling point of bitcoin. It basically means this book of transactions cannot be falsified or destroyed if it is supported by a big number of people (computers) which today it is, making it the quintessence of democracy. No company or government has the power to change this. Think of it like a calendar. Everyone agrees today is Monday so it’s Monday. You can’t change it to Wednesday so matter how big you are or how hard you try it’s still Monday. 

But what I described above isn’t called bitcoin. It’s called a blockchain. Bitcoin is the currency of the first blockchain. The transactions I described are all in bitcoin. 

Also people who support this network receive bitcoin as a reward and are called miners.

"If you are looking to Sell bitcoin for fiat money, then the methods available will differ based on a few factors:

- Where are you located (country)?
- How much are you looking to sell?
- What methods of payment will you accept?
- How soon do you need access to the proceeds?
- Is financial privacy important?

There are many payment methods for P2P trading, such as buyer deposits cash in your bank account, or transfers the funds to your account.  Know that there are risks in being defrauded when using bank transactions for Bitcoin trading, but if your buyer has a long and excellent trust history the risks are much lower.

None of the info in chapter 4 is outdated, nor is any of the rest of the book, I promise!

It's gone through 4 prints and 2 editions. The second edition in 2017 (after Segwit) was a major addition (30% new content) and a refresh of a lot of the existing content. 

All of the Segwit stuff, and the Lightning stuff was added on 2017 and is 100% relevant today.

"Hey! Glad you found my write-up useful. So to clear up some confusion:

k is a private key, and K is a public key. My write-up does not detail how k and K are constructed. That would be through [Elliptic Curve Point Multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve_point_multiplication) (otherwise known as scalar multiplication). k is simply a random number, and K is the result of scalar multiplication of k with the generator point, G. That topic is a little too advanced for what I was going for with the write-up, and is more general cryptography knowledge than bitcoin knowledge.

Segwit does not make k and K outdated, nor is Andreas' book outdated. It is worth it to continue reading the book, but if you want details on Segwit specifically, there is no better place (that I've found) to learn about it than the Bitcoin [developer documentation](https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-documentation) and the [BIP](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0141.mediawiki#examples)s for Segwit. What my write-up shows in the Addresses section is how to go **from a public key** (K) **to an address** (A).

"Thanks - I really appreciate your help with the keys from my last post, confirmation that I'm on the right track, and offer to help. I'll probably take you up - my plan now is to finish the M.B. book since you and others have said it's still worthwhile. You're right - it's pretty much guaranteed that as I read I'll come across more things that will need explaining.

I've also downloaded the code for Electrum but it became a little difficult to follow. There aren't many comments in the code, and I'm only familiar with CLI (not tkinter or Qt)...but I'll need to at least become familiar with those as well. I need to explore EAWF's repository too.

Fortunately I have a really good job. The reasons I'm learning this are:

* Realization that BTC and crypto are here to stay and will only get bigger. I've known this for a few years but it's hit a critical point for me: time to put belief to action.
* Improve my Python.
* Longer term: eventually contribute to open source BTC and crypto efforts, freelance on the side, etc.

For now - are these still good resources?

"**Elliptic curve point multiplication**

Elliptic curve point multiplication is the operation of successively adding a point along an elliptic curve to itself repeatedly.  It is used in elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) as a means of producing a one-way function.

The literature presents this operation as scalar multiplication, thus the most common name is elliptic curve scalar multiplication, as written in Hessian form of an elliptic curve.

If your wallet is not a 2fa one then the seed was generated by some other wallet software. In that case you have to check bip39 in electrum when restoring from seed.

"Nobody can predict the price in advance.

New bitcoin are minted with every block that's added to the blockchain. The halving is a once-every-4-years change, where the number of new bitcoin is reduced by 50%.

Currently a miner gets to mint 12.5 bitcoin for finding a block. In a few months, that number will drop to 6.25.

Miners have to sell the bitcoin they get (in order to pay for electricity & mining machines), and this acts as a downward pressure on the price - if someone is selling 12.5 bitcoin every 10 minutes, the market has to put in ~$10k per minute to keep the price static.

The theory is that, since miners only have half as much bitcoin to sell, the downward pressure will be reduced, and the price will rise as a result.

But it's not certain to play out that way at all.";1;0;False;Manticlops;fgdprk0;I need help!;exwydw;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/exwydw/i_need_help/
"I will be brief,

Halving = people taking part in the process in order to make the system work will receive less reward from doing so. Example, mining a block will now give 6.25 BTC instead of 12.5 (numbers from memory but it’s close). They are the pillars of the blockchain. 

Now BTC is a speculative asset and subject to offer/demand and could be a game changer in the money industry. Every speculative assets will have big swings in prices and that’s just the psychology of markets. 

Finally, since there is only a fix number of BTC that will ever be created and there are less and less of it, it creates scarcity, thus usually increasing the price. But it could as well not increase in the next halving. Based on the only 2 other halving in his history it did... so DYOR and invest with care.

What you could do is follow Dollar Cost Averaging. That's where you spread your buys over a certain period of time. e..g, 6 months, you buy $50 each month, to get you investing your target of $300 (for an example).

If the exchange rate goes down from here, great, your average price for your position will be less than ~$9.5K per BTC. If the exchange rate goes up from here, great, you got at least some at ~$9.5K per, which you wouldn't have gotten had you sat on the $300 for six months and bought all at once then.

There's still the risk of it going down after you purchase, but this strategy is one that works for many who struggle with FOMO or who stress over trying to time the market.

"**Dollar cost averaging**

Dollar cost averaging (DCA) is an investment strategy with the goal of reducing the impact of volatility on large purchases of financial assets such as equities. Dollar cost averaging is also called the constant dollar plan (in the US), pound-cost averaging (in the UK), and, irrespective of currency, as unit cost averaging, incremental trading or the cost average effect.By dividing the total sum to be invested in the market (e.g. $100,000) into equal amounts put into the market at regular intervals (e.g. $1000 over 100 weeks), DCA hopes to reduce the risk of incurring a substantial loss resulting from investing the entire lump sum just before a fall in the market.

"Agreed... I'm also an old-timer from the days of using archie to find downloadable files I wanted from FTP sites and veronica to find other resources available via gopher.

The potential that some of us saw back then while others were still scoffing at the idea was incredible.  We took those primitive systems and built a pervasive internet.  My kids can't imagine a world where it's not possible to get the answer to a question like, ""What's the capital of Madagascar?"" within a few seconds from a device you carry in your pocket while you're sitting on a park bench eating fast food.  That's only possible because of the vision that some of us in those early days had for the future of the tech.

Those saying that Bitcoin ""can't work"" remind me of the people back then who couldn't extrapolate from what we had to what we would have in the future (e.g. now).  Bitcoin right now is a lot like those early days.  It's clunky, it's warty, and even the ""easy to use"" software hits you with concepts that you really have to know what's going on underneath to make real sense of (""add more fees to speed up an unconfirmed transaction? huh?"").

People with no vision for how things develop over time see that and imagine the world trying to use it like that.  Of course they declare it a failure.  It'd be like if we'd advanced things like our mobile computing and so on without advancing our software and my kids had to open a remote shell from their phones to our home computer in order to do a veronica lookup and then fetch resources over gopher to get the answer they want.  That's not how they do it because that doesn't make sense.  It equally doesn't make sense to assume the same workflows and processes that apply to Bitcoin usage now being used in the future.  It was TCP/IP (via SLIP) for me back then and it's still TCP/IP now.  LNP/BP is being built now, and it'll be LNP/BP in the future too.

When this is mature and BTC is the standard, you won't need to exit to fiat at all, at least not in a considerable %.
By then, other areas will become good alternatives for rebalancing portfolios, perhaps real estate.

That said, agree. I'm old enough to have used all this before the Internet was available. Before even HTTP was introduced in 1991 (there was no ""web""). A few decades passed, and I haven't seen anything else that reminds me of those early days of great potential, until BTC appeared. Then something clicked for me for only the 2nd time during my lifetime - It feels familiar, saw this before, indeed like the Internet, but now it is for money. 

Unclear how it will evolve, but it will disrupt a lot of areas and in 20-30 years the concept of money will be totally different. In the same way the Internet fully changed a lot of areas (newspapers, shops, radio, TV, postal services, telcos, banks, etc, etc).

"> I'm just trying to find the pros of bitcoin over stocks at the moment.

One of Bitcoin's biggest strengths is that it's a bearer asset with its own extremely robust system of recording ownership. This strength is lost if, instead of buying bitcoin, you buy an IOU from a finance company of the sort Bitcoin threatens to subsume. The day you need your bitcoin savings will be the day that company is unable to provide them.

That the company is named after a character famous for taking peoples money away is irony-flavoured icing on a cake made of bad ideas.";5;0;False;Manticlops;fgdncg7;Is it a good time to buy bitcoin;exvjrn;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/exvjrn/is_it_a_good_time_to_buy_bitcoin/

Most recently I have used Coinbase.  I am not an authority on which exchange is better than the others.  Some people have had complaints about Coinbase.  My complaint: the last time I used it, they were happy to let me buy Bitcoin, but when I wanted to move the Bitcoin I had purchased from their exchange into my own wallet, I had to send them a photo of a driver's license.  In my opinion, that's pretty chickenshit -- they should have required the photo up front, BEFORE I purchased.  I'd been using Coinbase for years.  Now, I might not ever use them again... I don't know.  For this reason, I suggest you ask the general Bitcoin subreddit which exchanges are decent.;1;0;False;Mark_Bear;fgeoi8p;Is it a good time to buy bitcoin;exvjrn;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/exvjrn/is_it_a_good_time_to_buy_bitcoin/
"It's always a good time, but sometimes, it's a better time.

Try to buy with [Mayer Multiple](https://mayermultiple.info/) below 1.0 and charts like this one might give you a very easy grasp of if the price is fairly cheap (at the green line), really cheap (below the green line), pricey (considerably above the green line) or at FOMO levels (red or above).

Right now, in my expert opinion (Source: random internet guy pulling forecasts out of his aS@) the price is *slightly* overpriced but not much (considering s2f model estimation) but not by much. So maybe get a batch now and further batches in the next weeks to cost-average in case it drops more.

Only looks OK on desktop, not mobile: https://www.lookintobitcoin.com/charts/mvrv-zscore/

"RobinHood is an online brokerage -- a place for speculating.  It is not a place to ""buy bitcoin"", per se.  If all you want to do is speculate, then maybe RobinHood would work for you.

There are a number of exchanges where you can actually buy bitcoin.

Here's a useful comparison of exchanges in which you can filter on payment method:

- https://exchangewar.info  <-- Filter box for currency (e.g., EUR) or payment method (e.g., VISA)


Then you want to withdraw to a wallet where you control the keys.

1. (tie) Non-custodial. This is because ... [Not your keys, not your bitcoin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt-zXEsJ61U).

"Nobody knows the future price.

What you could do is follow Dollar Cost Averaging. That's where you spread your buys over a certain period of time. e..g, 6 months, you buy $50 each month, to get you investing your target of $300 (for an example).

If the exchange rate goes down from here, great, your average price for your position will be less than ~$9.5K per BTC. If the exchange rate goes up from here, great, you got at least some at ~$9.5K per, which you wouldn't have gotten had you sat on the $300 for six months and bought all at once then.

There's still the risk of it going down after you purchase, but this strategy is one that works for many who struggle with FOMO or who stress over trying to time the market.

"Thanks, but my one recommendation is that we don't lead users to KYC by default.

I understand it's easier, but so is using a credit card or paypal, but that's not the real point of Bitcoin.

If we want Bitcoin to win long-term, I think we need to get more people who are here because it's useful to them on its own merit, not because they want to gamble and win.

I think the biggest thing to understand is that if you use Bitcoin with KYC, it's kind of like using a spoon to cut a steak. You're taking away one of the major strengths of Bitcoin which is preservation of privacy.

Data leaks are all too common, in fact, Coinbase itself was forcibly required to release user information. Furthermore, Coinbase  continues to push fraud like Bitcoin (dot) Com's BCash which is a phishing scheme. We definitely don't need to give Roger Ver any more money.

Let's build a better Bitcoin future by educating people, rather than suggesting to let everyone sell out their privacy, autonomy, and freedom for the sake of a little convenience.

"You're not wrong, and your heart is in the right place. Unfortunately, all buying/selling that's not p2p is almost definitely tracked. Going down that rabbit hole provides more questions than it does answers.

"New users should first be educated on self-responsibility.

Even if it's inconvenient, users should first learn what it means to have full control (with great power, comes great responsibility) over their wealth. Almost everything else can be confiscated. Bitcoin cannot.

Third-party services have proven time, and time again, not to be trustworthy of your private information. Passwords, SSNs, data is getting hacked and leaked every day. And on top of that, many services commit fraud or push objectionable propaganda. We need to stop giving these places more power. Until now, we had to trust third parties. With Bitcoin, we don't.

In order to achieve this, Bitcoin requires users to learn and understand something in a very different way than they are perhaps used to. In a world of giving trust out to anyone and their dog, it's quite uncomfortable to become a responsible adult. But it's a very powerful concept.

With Bitcoin, you mathematically secure your wealth without anyone else needing to get involved in your personal finances.

I think the other thing new users should learn, in order to use Bitcoin effectively, is the value of privacy. In a world of Facebook, it's very tough to get people to understand it. People give away their private information to a huge corporate database - when they should be protecting it with their dear life - and giving that information away under NO circumstances.

The last thing we need is a surveillance state, and Facebook / Coinbase are just steps away (if not already) a part of that surveillance state. We should support Freedom in places like Hong Kong, but also in our own countries too.

So this is probably very unattractive to new users, because many of them don't care about politics and just want to use Bitcoin for whatever reason. But I think Bitcoin is also an opportunity to educate an entirely new generation of thinkers, who will value Freedom and Privacy like no other generation before it. If we can do a good job of educating them.

Young people are smart and have grown up in a world where internet technology has always existed. Bitcoin can be second nature to them, but perhaps the reason for Bitcoin isn't so obvious.";1;0;False;anon517;fgf8sbq;Bitcoin For Beginners: Getting Started (2020);exuyo1;https://www.bitrawr.com/bitcoin-for-beginners

Building an application without needing to manage data is hugely profitable. Facebook as an example have dedicated facilities to host users data, at a cost.

Buying shitcoins is not diversication because cryptocurrencies generally move in concert with Bitcoin, so you have exposure to only one asset class (crypto).

Diversication means buying asset classes which move in price largely independently from crypto such as stocks, gold or real estate. For stocks, it’d have to be in companies not related to Bitcoin, so buying stocks in a mining company would also be a bad way to diversify your portfolio.

Generally, if you want to reduce risk, you’ll want to build a portfolio of uncorrelated assets. The upside will be limited - less risk means less potential returns.

It’s perfectly fine to speculate and put all your money on Bitcoin or crypto, just be aware that adding shitcoins is going to increase downside risk, as you have experienced.";2;0;False;trilli0nn;fgf5psf;10 Reasons to Buy Bitcoin;exrhhk;https://joemarty.org/10-reasons-to-buy-bitcoin/
As someone who used to own bitcoin, I do believe it will first even out. These highs and lows have a trend to even out, and it will slowly rise, year over year, like it's doing now. There is absolutely zero reason why it would massively spike again after the last spike and it would take trillions of dollars and transactions to do it. BUT what it will do is go up and up and up year over year over year. It will have bad days, and good, but the trend is a slow increase. Once it crosses the 20k line and makes everyone 'whole' then it will become even more wildly popular, but based on my opinion, it won't cross 20k til 2022.;1;0;False;tommygunz007;fge501w;10 Reasons to Buy Bitcoin;exrhhk;https://joemarty.org/10-reasons-to-buy-bitcoin/

Airdrops (and forks in general) will always be controversial. The biggest indicator of fraud is looking like fraud. If you don’t claim BCZ, then don’t expect to be able to do anything with the BCZ you have. That said, this is the first I’m hearing of it, and I suppose one of my accounts somewhere has some, somehow. I don’t know how to retrieve them or to even know if they’re a legitimate fork. Obviously, I’m not claiming them. You can’t get much more of a solid defense than “I didn’t know and haven’t touched it”. You get in hot water when you say “I didn’t know” but then sell off everything or cash them out when price goes up. Contrary to popular belief, the IRS aren’t dicks for the sole purpose of being dicks (the legislature/law behind what the IRS does is another story), they’re just looking for fraud and all those “boating accidents”.;1;0;False;ExtraIncrease;fgemorw;So who is checking the box (Did you buy crypto currency on there taxes)?;exp6k3;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/exp6k3/so_who_is_checking_the_box_did_you_buy_crypto/

"Ah, so in the same way they said it was illegal to buy drugs, drive over the speeding limit and user pirated software? Oh, wait...
Many countries already ""banned"" btc, that didn't really make a difference. Some reverted those rulings, others kept them in place, but the outcome is the same. If it really catches up, it wont' be easy to stop someone from merely memorizing 12 words and trading with someone else who did the same.
Not the same as freezing bank accounts.


It's too late to try bans on fiat ramps and trading. They're past that stage and would merely lose to competing nations who would allow such industries to flourish. It would be like trying to ban the Internet in 1995 - not good for the economy.

They might have had that option many years ago, but it is now long gone. Plus, I doubt they want it since the current state also brings them a few advantages - ability to monitor transactions a lot better than with cash - and extra/easier taxes when those structures are in place.

"I think the genie is out of the bottle at this stage. There are several theoretical ways to ""kill it"" but all seem impractical due to technical/social/political complexities.

In my opinion the only way to ""kill it"" is making it unnecessary and without a use case that people would need. That could only happen a long set of conditions were met, for example, having honest Central Bankers and politicians who would focus on sound money/long term stability vs quick solutions merely to please the masses at the cost of future generations.

The only way to kill it is turning it into a solution for a problem that no longer exists. I'm not optimistic enough to see that utopia happening any time soon.

The amount of known supply is a fair point. Yes it's not practical for daily usage but converting to fiat is not overly difficult. As for fake gold there are very easy ways to make sure you are purchasing real gold. Plus it's backed by thousands of years of accepted use as a store of value and is I think far less volatile than bitcoin. Bitcoin is a fascinating concept which may very well work out but it's also anonymous and open to market manipulation. We don't know who has most of it do we?

"Not looking for fight either :)
Gold is indeed backed by thousands of years of culture, but the problem is that the governments and banks of the world cleverly used salami tactics to take away this sound money. They issued papers to replace the gold, which people did not trust at first but then gave up since they were indeed far more convenient, but then many years later when we lost the knowledge and skill to handle gold they detached the papers from the gold.
Unless you are holding physical gold yourself, I don’t see you as a gold investor. You’re holding papers, government stocks, a trust based promise, not the asset itself. The problem with gold is that even if some crisis hits and people start hoarding gold, the governments could use the same salami tactics again. It may take time, even a whole generation, but we will reach the same place of today. People in large groups are very stupid.
With bitcoin, it’s a one way street. If mass adoption happens, there is no reason to go back. A paper equivalent to bitcoin could be slightly more convenient, but not enough to worth the psychological trust.
Every bitcoin cycle, more people will understand that it is a cultural one-way street (maybe they will be unable to explain it, but they will have a gut feeling).

"There’s nothing philosophical about finance with respects to the law. If we’re taking no philosophy into consideration the only rule is the law. It just further proves the point that people should absolutely not be able to skirt the law via lack of transparency/privacy. 

When you take a step back, the whole argument of “personal freedom with BTC” superseding the law is philosophical. 

If you really, truly look at the world it’s very Orwellian already, and that’s not because of too much transparency. It is in large because of a lack of transparency in a) governing bodies, and b) the global elite that cheat the system. Both are enabled via privacy and lack of transparency .

"Arguing that the basis for the laws of humankind (financial or not) are not philosophical is an extremely tenuous position to take. What other basis for laws would there be? Could there be? You realize that the structure of society has been a topic of investigation since the earliest records of written inquiry? 

I too despise the sorta of evils and injustices you’ve mentioned, but I absolutely disagree that privacy is the reason those things exist. An absolute lack of privacy allows far worse abuses to exist. It will grant further ability to those in positions of power to abuse it, while giving no shelter for anyone not in power to improve themselves.

"You are contradicting yourself. In your first statement, you stated my opinion was not valid because it took philosophy into consideration. Now you are saying that I am arguing that laws are not philosophical. My point was specifically was that you cannot make the argument for financial liberty through privacy without a conversation of philosophy.   


If philosophy is removed then the only thing people have to base judgment on is the written letter of the law which would not side in the favor of the position you are defending. In the circumstant **you** first put forward which is a world of white and black, violating the law regardless of your moral(personal philosophical) position is wrong -ergo you can't justify unlimited financial privacy because it enables the criminality that creates the disparity we see today. 

You can disagree with my opinion, but recognize it's not an opinion founded in evidence it is a philosophical one. I will again site the Panama papers as an excellent example of how privacy directly translates how privacy allows for financial criminality - this is just one, of thousands of examples.

Pulling it back to crypto, billions in crypto theft occurred in 2019, giving these people greater means to hide from their crimes doesn't seem to lend itself to legitimize the space.

"I didn't mean to state your opinion was invalid because it is based upon \*a\* philosophy, I just meant to point out that attempting to categorize 'good' or 'bad' (whether through explicit law, or some more implicit means) is an inherently moral endeavour. You say ""we should stop these bad behaviours"", I say ""this is a global system in which we can't possibly expect everyone to agree on what is bad-- so this doesn't seem to be the right basis to argue about privacy from"". 

\>There’s nothing philosophical about finance with respects to the law. If we’re taking no philosophy into consideration the only rule is the law.

This is where I understood you to mean laws are not built from a philosophical foundation. But I think we're playing some game of semantic misunderstandings, thats pulling us away from the more interesting point of whether privacy is unjustifiably enabling of bad behaviours, or not. I don't mean to argue that privacy doesn't lead to bad things happening in private, but I do argue that a lack of privacy is much worse. 

Without privacy, society loses the ability to be self-critical, and improve itself (this is more or less the thesis of the article I linked). For example, if your financial history gave clues to you being gay, and being gay was highly illegal, then what chance would you have to enjoy life as you want? An absolute lack of privacy requires a 'perfect morality' to be declared by society: laws and moral reasoning that cannot be improved upon. A declaration of what is good, in absolute terms. Yet this is far from how healthy societies operate: culture and morality shifts over time, and I see no reason that this will stop. So I think that allowing individuals the tools to express themselves is important (and privacy is one of those tools).";1;0;False;Chytrik;fgevmhc;"I replaced the word ""crime"" and ""criminal"" with ""Freedom"" and ""Freedom lovers"" in this hit piece against privacy by Chainanalysis. it is now a guide to reclaiming some privacy";ewxi16;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ewxi16/i_replaced_the_word_crime_and_criminal_with/

"With bitcoin, or gold, I'm the holder of a scarce asset. With stocks I'm not the holder, the bank is the holder, and they can close their doors, or tell me that they are holding my stock while actually they aren't, or ""print"" more and more stocks without telling anyone, and by the time I'm old and I discover that they cheated, it's too late for me.

The only reason I would give my money to a company that promises X% per year is based on the assumption that by the time I'm old (or want to buy a house) I could pull not only the X% but also my original money (and that X is greater than the prices inflation that comes from money-printing). What is your answer to those who say they don't trust any company, or afraid of hyper-inflation?";1;0;False;unickname;fggcr63;The Empirical Proof of Bitcoin's Real Value Being Zero;ewqyue;https://youtu.be/WSYTXmxPveY
"If I am forced to leave my country with nothing but my shoes and clothes, I can take my bitcoin with me. And in the new country, I could find someone who will give me food and shelter for my bitcoin, someone who happens to have extra food and a shelter to give me, and he will want my bitcoin for the same reason I wanted it (or for other reasons).

Dreams and nightmares aren't tangible. If owning bitcoin makes the irrational people in this forum sleep well at night, then bitcoin has value. If other people will see them sleeping well, they will also want to buy bitcoin, which will make the price rise.";1;0;False;unickname;fggeg9o;The Empirical Proof of Bitcoin's Real Value Being Zero;ewqyue;https://youtu.be/WSYTXmxPveY

I would agree that both Bitcoin and Gold started with no marketing budget, but with gold being the most ancient of OG currencies, its hard to evaluate its 'launch phase'. When Gold IPO'ed its first nuggets, there was no such thing marketing budgets, or even markets !;1;1;False;HODL_monk;fgg7pmm;Indeed;ewic0z;https://i.redd.it/fbs2behrd1e41.jpg
