"The condo is a non-warrantable condo which generally means that it does not meet all of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac’s lending requirements. Accordingly, financing is very difficult to get and the loan terms are not as favorable

"Retirement accounts right now.  I will open up a line of credit after I close, which will in part serve as my emergency fund.  I’ll also use that LOC to follow the velocity banking strategy to get out of debt.

"So the answer is no.  You don't have an emergency fund of even $1000 cash that you could use right away.  

Retirement accounts are for retirement.  If you live in the US then there is an automatic 10% penalty for early withdrawal + regular income tax.  So if you needed to pay a $1,000 car bill, then you need to borrow or withdrawal at least $1,250+/- from your retirement account to pay the tax man and then use your money.  If it's a loan then you pay interest on that. 

If you leverage CC, that's just more high interest debt.

Line of credit is a loan against the equity in an asset that is collateral.  If you are planning a LoC off a condo, that is unbuilt, that is super risky (Fannie and Freddie won't loan), and that builder goes belly up and your half built vacation condo isn't worth the mortgage OR the LOC.... Good luck in bankruptcy.

"funnily enough i feel this explanation leaves out the actual ""money"" in the conversation. Money is an illusion... it literally would be worthless if everybody in the world decided their stuff was suddenly more valuable and didn't want to trade it for an exchangeable.. nothing has any value except the value we put on it, the value of how difficult/rare, an object (or service, or our time).. is.  and in truth even that has only an abstract value(as it stands clear that over time our values have changed.. and so proving that our previous values were inadequate/inaccurate to our actual(potential) needs) 

.. and so in truth this whole conversation isn't about ""money"" or ""value"" it is about our strategies for distributing and accounting for said value. 

i would propose that the vast majority of wealth is currently held.. earned... in previous era's. technology previously invented, implemented, and almost always made entirely to benefit *the majority*. and yet we live in a world where that value is not only hoarded and often regarded as owned by a select few.. but in fact when you think about the creation of nearly *anything* the value was often made entirely by the effort, creativity, and persistence of just ordinary workers. working for a menial wage. your great grandfather working for the pipeline that allowed the ships to sail from the great columbia for the past 100 years... the same ships that distributed the goods that spurred on the great american economy and allowed the massive industry that popped up in china in the past few years... that fleet has moved incredible wealth and numerous fortunes.. but in truth that value... where did it come from? who owes their success to whom?

Also this series doesn't have to be on purpose. You borrow money and a few days later you have to pay your electricity bill. So you pay your bill thorough a banking institution. It is no different than depositing that money.

What is more interesting is that if something happens and all countries block all banking. Then everyone cannot pay all of their debts because of interest.

"Porque no los dos

I did not mean to reduce it into an advertisement, more paying it forward since there were others before who did a lot of work to get me to understand Bitcoin, hopefully others can gain from being early adopters as well.

Being that Bitcoin is an experiment it has a nonzero chance of failure, and so any investment should be done with that in mind. Rule number one in Bitcoin is having a low time preference for the money you have in Bitcoin. 

But a small investment will go a long way, and we are presently at a time where the price seems to have created a floor, and we are not too far above it currently. It is a great time as any to start, and of course DCAing is a good discipline to develop. 

Its always revealing to go through posts on bitcoin talk forums from 2014 and 2015 and see the same arguments and reservations being expressed.

">Is that really rich though? If you're in your 30s you wouldn't even be able to retire. $1M in the western world could set you up on a road to become actually rich, but wouldn't make you rich alone.

It really depends on what kind of retirement you want to have. The general heuristic is that you should be able to draw 4% (3% if you want to be extra safe) a year, and have it last indefinitely, if you have invested in index funds. $40,000 of purchasing power a year could be enough for someone to retire, depending on what their goals are.

"Lending on BFX and Poloniex mostly.

I had a bot that loaned on Polo which was very profitable around the time of the forks. Being verified before 2017 was very useful because by the time the hoards came along, it was impossible to get verified. That meant that those of us loaning were getting very high interest rates, sometimes over 1%/day.

Selling BTC forks got me from 600BTC to nearly 900. Bitcoin Diamond was the most profitable netting 12% more BTC by selling on the fork date. It was China's answer to Bitcoin Gold and all the chinese exchanges supported it before the blockchain even existed.

There were probably 30 forks that made good returns since people didn't understand bitcoins value proposition and were chasing the next bitcoin by buying crap like Bitcoin God and Bitcoin File.

Some exchanges like Yobit even had fake forks where they gave you tokens for forks that would never exist and people bought it.

"I think this is really simple if you just ask some questions and get the answers. I'm not an expert, but even I can figure it out, e.g.

from bottom to top:

Q: What is a blockchain? A: A chain of batched data in which each batch of data is cryptographically linked to the previous batch.  
Q: Why is the data linked cryptographically? A: To make it difficult to change by brute force.  
Q: Why is the data linked together in a chain? A: To make the data increasingly difficult to hack as time progresses.  
Q: Why does it become increasingly difficult over time? A: Because miners regularly link new data to the end of the chain.  
Q: Why do they do that? A: Because they are rewarded for doing so.  
Q: How are they rewarded? A: With new bitcoins.  
Q: How is that a reward: A: It's a reward because people value bitcoins.  
Q: Why are bitcoins valued so highly? A: Because they are the only secure digital asset.  
Q: Why are they secure? A: Because it's almost impossible to hack the blockchain  
Q: Why? A: Because the blockchain data is decentralized and distributed, and the mining hash power is decentralized.

Now from top to bottom:

Q: What would it mean if the blockchain data wasn't decentralized and distributed, and the mining hash power wasn't decentralized? A: It would mean the organization that controls the blockchain can direct the mining to go back and change the data, no matter how old it is.  
Q: What does that mean? A: It means the data would be easily changed by the parent organization, but it would be difficult to change by others.  
Q: What does that mean? A: It means the tokens with which the miners are rewarded wouldn't be secure.  
Q: What does that mean? A: It means the tokens wouldn't be valuable because the parent organization can easily change them.  
Q: What does that mean? A: It means the process of mining wouldn't be rewarded with anything valuable.  
Q: What does that mean? A: It means there would be no incentive to mine new batches of data.  
Q: What does that mean? A: It means there would be no point in creating the blockchain in the first place.";1;1;False;anon2414691;ffr8ad8;Blockchain Question.;eu56cc;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/eu56cc/blockchain_question/

Almost impossible to hack the Blockchain, but not impossible because it’s dependent on price increases to keep it worth securing as you’ve mentioned.

"**Lightning Network**

The Lightning Network is a ""Layer 2"" payment protocol that operates on top of a blockchain-based cryptocurrency (like Bitcoin). It enables fast transactions among participating nodes and has been touted as a solution to the Bitcoin scalability problem. It features a peer-to-peer system for making micropayments of cryptocurrency through a network of bidirectional payment channels without delegating custody of funds. Lightning Network implementation also simplifies atomic swaps.

"Appreciate it. 

For what it’s worth, there was a lot of thought that went into this purchase.  Additionally, I wouldn’t consider myself as a subprime borrower. My credit karma score is 800+ with a corresponding excellent FICO score (which is a bit less). I have a very stable job at the moment.  Obviously no one knows what tomorrow may bring. 

I do acknowledge that I will be out a lot of money making this investment.  I’ve already put down 10% of the purchase price to secure the condo.  Although this is a second home/vacation rental, I should be able to rent it out on air BnB for more than the monthly mortgage costs (with taxes, insurance, etc).  There might be a slight negative cash flow initially because I also have to get furniture for the condo. 

I fully expect that my cash reserve situation will begin to show rapid improvement after closing.  Although I’m being hard on myself with having no reserves, I’m still making our my Roth 401k and Roth IRA every year as well as remaining current on all my debts (which is just a mortgage, car loan and student loans). 

I think about finances on a daily basis and it is a passion of mine. I read financial books and watch tons of YouTube videos on personal finance. I also recall what it was like during the 2008 real estate market decline. I am very familiar with the importance is having an emergency fund.  However, there are more than one approach to reaching financial independence. 

For example, there are some schools of thought that suggest one should be debt free. Yet another suggests that one should use debt as leverage to build wealth. 

The velocity banking method I referenced above suggests that you should use a line of credit as an emergency fund in the effort to pay off debt.

Because personal finance is personal, I have to take all these various approaches and apply it to my life the best way I know how.  

I appreciate the sincere well wishes. Regardless of the path I take, I certainly don’t want to be in a situation where I have to declare bankruptcy.  I definitely won’t be blaming the banks or my realtor or anyone else for the decisions I make.  I don’t believe though that I am making a bad decision all else being equal.  It might not be the best decision (probably isn’t) but I don’t believe it’s a bad one. On the contrary, I think it will set me to succeed and it fits squarely in my plan tj retire in about 15 years. 

The fault is mine because I haven’t chosen to put my entire financial situation online for the world to see, and I still don’t intend to. But I do think my strategy is based on more than just hope. 

Again thanks for the well wishes.  I really appreciate it.";1;1;False;DividendPortfolio;ffrdmox;Selling bitcoin to payoff student loans;eur4e3;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/eur4e3/selling_bitcoin_to_payoff_student_loans/

"Mate

Just hold onto it

Sounds like you’re holding about .3 bitcoin and if you don’t know what a halving is..
We are in the midst of bitcoins 3rd halving, which is associated with the shock in supply/demand and the huge growth that usually follows the halving about a year later.

It’s not a for sure event, granted, but the likelihood of bitcoin surpassing 20,000 is simply a matter of when.

With as much bitcoin as you seem to have I would suggest holding that for two years and simply forget any notions you had of selling.

If bitcoin reaches 100k that’s around 30k for you.
If it reaches crazy prices some people throw out like say 400k, for shits and giggles, by maybe 2021 you could have a substantial bit o honey.

"Bitcoin teaches us that if you have to trust a centralized 3rd party, the opportunity for corruption is too great.

For small issues, 3rd party trust is fine. But for important ones, such as money, or power to tax, you certainly should EXPECT a great deal of corruption. It's like a pile of dung drawing political flies. It's unavoidable.

Taxes should be a last resort, and limited.

You have to understand, inflation is a hidden tax. If you combine the known tax with the hidden tax, you're being taxed something like > 70% of your income. And worse over time. So if you're a saver from 1990 maybe ""total tax"" is more than 90% of your income. And a saver from 1913? Tax collection is probably 99.999995% of your income.

What is that? That is slavery.

No government should have the right to tax to infinity. Maximum tax should be fixed by law (including printing money as a hidden tax). Perhaps 20%.

If the government can't operate on the idea that 5% of people's life isn't sufficient to operate the government, then the government is broken and needs to fix itself rather than rely on burning more money. Taxation, as it happens today, is completely theft.

People didn't need taxes for 100 years in the U.S. and it worked perfectly.

We kept introducing socialist programs like public schools and retirement security, and we end up in a system where for every $100 you give to the government, you get $1 in value back. The rest gets burned up in bureaucracy and stupid policies that don't serve the people at all. It would be far more efficient if we cut out the government middle man, and let highway tolls/fees pay for roads, have police and firefighters directly funded by city residents through donations (what kind of person wouldn't donate? their city would go to crap) and also funded by fire/incident penalties. For example, the PG&E fires would be paid by the stupidity of PG&E as they caused billions of dollars and damages, which a large portion would go to these services. Do you think fire and police could operate on billions of dollars? Yes. And no taxes were needed.

We don't need taxes. The concept that taxes are needed to fund all these stupid, inefficient gov't programs may be a mathematical truth, but it's not the only way and certainly not the only way to fund programs. Religion is an important part of people's lives, and religious institutions make BILLIONS or TRILLIONS of dollars, without taxes. It's a service, provided to people, yet somehow, we need taxes. They thrive without taxes. Why wouldn't our infrastructure also thrive? People want religion as much as they want roads and retirement programs. If so, they will gather and create them and fund them. There is no need for religions to fund themselves through taxation.

But people are lazy, illogical, and have a terrible way with money. They don't understand where money comes from, and so they support psychopaths like Bernie Sanders, or Trump, or Obama, or Woodrow Wilson. They are easily swayed by ads on Facebook. They don't think critically. An A.I. was able to predict the winner of political candidates based on measures of simply how confident they looked in their candidate photo. Which tells you a lot about how people elect their leaders. It's idiotic.

"The easiest way to understand this is that the only ""real"" money is physical cash (notes, coins), because if you hold it then you cannot lend it without physically transferring it to someone else. Everything else in the banking world is an IOU, a form of loan of one kind or another.

If you have savings in a bank account, the bank owes you money. The number showing on your statement is how much the bank owes you, not an amount that the bank is storing somewhere on your behalf. The money that went into your account may have been cash, in which case that physical cash is now the bank's cash, which you exchanged for debt (i.e. before you had cash, now you have a debt asset, i.e. the bank owes you money). If the money in your account came from someone else's bank account at another bank, that is just a transfer of debt between parties, which banks facilitate through the various payment systems.

So in those terms, debt IS money, and most money in circulation is not just ""based on debt"", it IS debt. Debt has all the necessary characteristics of money - widely used means of exchange (buying things by transferring debt, i.e. moving money between bank or credit card accounts), stable store of value, and unit of account. The thought that suddenly everyone could pay off their debts and there would be almost no money left is basically true but also a meaningless hypothetical -  it could never actually happen because most of the people holding debts by definition don't have the money to pay them off.  

The only real problem is that it can be difficult to tell the difference between good debt and bad debt, but that's another story.";1;0;False;datageek9;ffrnx18;Told my Mother to read 'The Creature From Jekyll Island' by Edward Griffin.

"I think the fees are pretty reasonable given the ease of use.

Sending lightning payments has a 0.1% fee so a $100 payment has a fee of 1[edit: 10] cent.

Receiving an on chain payment has a fee of 0.5% so for $100 you pay 50 cents.

Plus, for that 50 cent fee you get a Lightning channel created with a balance of $100 and they give you $100 of inbound capacity. That means you have a channel you can start using right away for as long as you like.

I've got 2 channels open, total balance of 650.
I've made 74 lightning payments so far.

Total fees were $3.25 for on chain and $1.62 for lightning.

That comes to an average of 3 cents per transaction and that's higher than it needs to be because I have a high total balance. In practice most users will have average fees of less than 1c.

Plus, I get a Lightning channel that I never have to close that I can make unlimited payments from by topping up using Lightning as I spend.";5;1;False;jamckp;ffrkwqj;Electrum Lightning Demo;eukaz1;https://youtu.be/dg1fyd5_foA

I understand that, but my whole point was that if/when I would buy something, I would do research on the company. I would make sure I was confident enough in their business outlook before I spent money on one of their products.

"Urrr no was in response to bitcoin is the only secure digital asset.

And who says the organisation will or would change the data, I mean if it was data and not Bitcoins who says they would.

Are you guessing they would?

Maybe they would if it is for Bitcoins which have value at present but what if it was relating to something that no one was so interested in.

If it's not so interesting then is it even worth the effort to put it into a blockchain and append new data by mining?

"That's not typical, but it's hard to say where those specific coins have been and what bitfinex's policies and/or blockchain analysis software is claiming is the concern. Clearly, you are able to exit that BTC to fiat via P2P exchange so it's no less valuable in the marketplace, but how you choose to respond to such blatant oppression of your right to privacy is something only you can decide.

If you believe in what BTC stands for and what its trying to achieve, you should try to support P2P exchanges like Bisq and use BTC as it's intended to be used - as a DECENTRALIZED store of value that empowers the individual. If you don't care about the culture and just want to day trade for supplemental income, then by all means, stick with KYC and accept the implications of doing so. 

Just know that over time, every coin in circulation will eventually be associated with one that's been mixed, sold P2P, and/or used for illegal activity just the same as how every fiat dollar in existence has been mixed with drug money somewhere down the line. If KYC exchanges start flagging every coin that's been ""tainted,"" they'll have to do so with every coin on their exchange. It's not sustainable, and something will eventually have to give.";1;0;False;HiFi24Seven;ffrmbup;Localbitcoins.com;etzhc6;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/etzhc6/localbitcoinscom/
