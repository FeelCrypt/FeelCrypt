What cost for bitcoin.tax, like 30 bucks or so. What ends up happening is that as you make transactions it adds them all up, that’s why you got 900k but the software will figure out most math for you once you put in the csv files from your exchange. It will then subtract the 900k - your selling, etc and figure out your capital gains or losses. If it’s loses I believe you can claim like 3000 grand or so and the rest can go to next year and more after that if needed. Look up the 3000 might be more or less.

"sounds like the total 900k, is either, total amount bought, or total amount sold, or a combination. 

like, i bought $5, then sold 4.50, then bought back in at 4, then sold at 3.

your total could be all the money that moved through, 5+4.5+4+3.  

or just the amount you bought, 5+4.

or sold, 4.50+ 3

in this scinario you traded the total amount, but came out at a loss of 1.50.

"In your case it's really hard to say which is the better setup since both your mobile as well as your desktop can be considered pretty secure.

For payments on the go mycelium is definitely a good way to go, especially when setup on lineage which is known for its outrageous security and its independence from google. Mycelium is one of just a few open source wallets that is *verifiable* which means compiling its official code from github leads to the same executable results which are downloadable from google play and the likes. 
Some people avoid recommending mycelium because they once had started an ico which never turned out to be distributed nor profitable. It's even claimed devs ran away with the raised funds but there are also articles on the matter telling the story in a different way where various unforseen payment obligations on mycelium's side led to an empty fund basket.
Nevertheless: I like using it and never had serious issues with it.

Electrum maybe a nice desktop wallet especially when setup as real cold storage (see their docs...) with a second machine involved. You can set it up in a way, that your transactions are signed on the complete offline-sided machine and then are propagated on the other machine that has online connection. So in case you have on old notebook etc that you can dedicate completely to 'electrum-offline side' you can achieve a damn secure offline setup. Imho when used correctly it is more secure than hardware wallets (maybe even similar to glacier protocol).
Electrum has some really nice features. Coincontrol, transaction batching or replace by fee, just to name a few. When setup with additional electrum server software you can even have your own fullnode backing your wallet. But that maybe something especially for advanced users. Or later.

So, that's how I'd go about it if I was you. Mycelium on the go, Electrum for desktop maybe even setup including cold storage feature.

"**Ponzi scheme**

A Ponzi scheme (, Italian: [ˈpontsi]; also a Ponzi game) is a form of fraud that lures investors and pays profits to earlier investors with funds from more recent investors. The scheme leads victims to believe that profits are coming from product sales or other means, and they remain unaware that other investors are the source of funds. A Ponzi scheme can maintain the illusion of a sustainable business as long as new investors contribute new funds, and as long as most of the investors do not demand full repayment and still believe in the non-existent assets they are purported to own.

The scheme is named after Charles Ponzi, who became notorious for using the technique in the 1920s.

Once the general population finds out it can avoid inflation by using bitcoin, and that they can always travel and trade with it with no middlemen and even trade with criminals, they will ditch their fiat and many other traditional bank investments and buy bitcoin instead.

"A hardware wallet generates and stores a seed value. You should always write down and safely store the seed regardless of it being stored in the device. If you don't plan to use it regularly then there is no reason to leave the seed value in the device. You can safely wipe the device and rely only on your paper/metal backups of the seed value. When you want to spend then you restore the seed again on the device for creating transactions.

While this is fine I'm not sure I agree it's necessary. I tend to favour using a passphrase for higher values and the blank (none) password for small or decoy btc values.

anyone who robs me would only get the one with 10% of my wealth unless they are planning a bank robbery

Really Jeff? At this point I'd be happy to be alerted about any technical concerns the guy reckons will cause bitcoin to break and become unusable any day now- perhaps we could even do something about it if that's the case. Because a profound and un-fixable technical problem or major hostile government legislation the only scenario I can imagine where something that costs thousands of dollars a unit will become free instead because Jeff reckons it's not a currency.

I mean who even gives a fuck if you call it a currency anymore? Bitcoin is bitcoin backed by itself and it does what it does (or what people do with it), which is a thing many people are finding all sorts of interesting uses for in addition to which not everything that has value and is traded or used as collateral or whatever is a currency. Gold is no currency, so I guess no probs for Jeff to click a few hundred bricks of it over to me.

Lightning network is a network of channels. Everyone can reach everyone by relaying the transaction across multiple nodes. Just as this message is reaching you by passing through many switches of the internet, and we don't need a direct connection with each other.;4;0;False;Leading_Zeros;fg3ao2j;How does BTC payment in retail stores work?;ewo242;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ewo242/how_does_btc_payment_in_retail_stores_work/
"The short answer is that if you're spending hundreds or thousands using Bitcoin in a retail store, you can wait for transaction confirmation  

Bic Camera in Japan does not accept Bitcoin directly. They pay a third-party payment gateway to process Bitcoin transactions. The payment processor would have limits and rules to avoid being exposed to double-spend theft  
The article you linked is more than 2 years old. When it was new, there was a lot of ""this is great for adoption"" hype, but actual Bic customers reported that the stores had Bitcoin signs, but none of the staff knew anything about it. I still haven't read about anybody actually spending Bitcoin in a Bic store  

> after purchasing I could just leave the store and just instantly send the same BTC with a higher fee to an other wallet of mine

If your transaction confirmation is delayed, the store can spend the unconfirmed transaction output in a transaction to itself with sufficient fees - child-pays-for-parent - before you have a chance to send your own double-spend  

It's worth noting that the Bitcoin White Paper describes Bitcoin's purpose as avoiding third-party payment processors. In a physical store, customers can spend cash currency (notes and coins) to avoid the baggage of credit cards and banks. Bitcoin was developed to be analogous to cash for online transactions. A few physical stores do accept Bitcoin, but that's not its purpose";2;1;False;igadjeed;fg3enca;How does BTC payment in retail stores work?;ewo242;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ewo242/how_does_btc_payment_in_retail_stores_work/
The store doesn't need a lightning channel with each customer.  Payments route through multiple channels to reach the payment destination.;1;0;False;SandwichOfEarl;fg3ge2d;How does BTC payment in retail stores work?;ewo242;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ewo242/how_does_btc_payment_in_retail_stores_work/
"These are all very good questions.

To begin, here's one interesting fact: did you know that credit card payments take 120 days to reach ""1 confirmation"" (as in becoming irreversible like a Bitcoin payment reaching its first few confirmations does)?   
Yet, most stores don't make you wait 120 days on their floor :)

It's all a matter of risk/convenience, so most physical stores will be happy to accept an unconfirmed payment right away, as long as the fraud rate is ridiculously small.

And if you really do make a large payment (say you buy a car at a dealership), then yeah the seller will probably make you wait for a few confs around a coffee table.

&#x200B;

That's for on-chain payments, so of course Lightning is a game changer for small payments, that greatly reduces the risk of accepting the payment instantly to nearly zero.   
To answer your question, no, the store and the customer do not necessarily need to have a direct channel. 

Payments are routed from node to node until they reach their destination. It's just like the Internet, you and I do not have a direct Internet link between our computers, and even if we talk through Reddit, we do not even have a direct link to Reddit's servers either. There's likely about a dozen Internet routers propagating our messages back and forth.";1;0;False;bitbug42;fg40vnm;How does BTC payment in retail stores work?;ewo242;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ewo242/how_does_btc_payment_in_retail_stores_work/
"> I still haven't read about anybody actually spending Bitcoin in a Bic store

I've done so many times.  It's true that at a lot of them, the staff have no idea but at the larger ones they're more comfortable with it now.

A few notes:

* Their payment provider is BitFlyer.
* They do accept ""zero confirmations and walk out"" for any amount that I've paid so far (largest purchase was probably around 180000 yen).
* HOWEVER: If your wallet has RBF (Replace By Fee) enabled, their system says that the payment is ""pending"" instead of done until it's in a block. They will (politely) ask you to wait.
* Your receipt is in yen and they also inform you that if you come back for a return/refund, it'll be in yen, they don't refund BTC.

>A few physical stores do accept Bitcoin,

"> why are they all Bitcoin Cash fanatics despite the name r/btc? Am I missing something?

You're missing the history. /r/btc is older than BCash. It was adopted by big block proponents after their persistent promotion of bigger blocks was censored in /r/Bitcoin by this rule:  

> Promotion of client software which attempts to alter the Bitcoin protocol without overwhelming consensus is not permitted

Two attempts to add bigger blocks to Bitcoin were promoted and failed. Then BCash forked a separate chain with double-size blocks. This was successful, but the main big block proponents had all their bets on SegWit2x, a fork with double block size and SegWit. SegWit2x failed, then the big block crowd moved their support to BCash and rewrote history, claiming they always hated SegWit anyway. They also claim BCash is the real Bitcoin and BTC is the fork chain";9;0;False;igadjeed;fg3h5m3;Why is someone paying to promote this sub, and why are they all Bitcoin Cash fanatics despite the name r/btc?

Buying gift cards was one thing I was considering, but our purchases for office supplies for year don’t even hit the amount donated. And we’d most likely need to use the amount in a year (typical of “restricted” donations in nonprofits) . I also considered buying the gift certificates and using them for our fundraisers and auctioning them off. But I’d have to check with the donor to make sure that’s okay.;1;0;False;Ck43;fg39jv5;How could we spend bitcoin?;ewkpc0;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ewkpc0/how_could_we_spend_bitcoin/

"Yes, I did do about 2 hours of research and have a few ideas. But thought I would ask if anyone has ideas and experience in this situation.  
My gut reaction was to take the money and then figure it out, but as a nonprofit it’s important to be a good steward of money, so it seems more ethical to try to brain storm how to use it prior to taking it.

"Treat the btc, like you never had it...hold it. You will thank me later... Look how much it increased this past month...

If you survived in the past, paying bills, employees, etc. You can survive without spending the bitcoin...

"Those stipulations are strange.  You're a non-profit org and it should be obvious you want to use the money to further the service that you perform.  Whether you spend it directly or convert it to fiat and then spend that, either way works out roughly the same.

The idea to take your salary in it makes sense to me.  It's no different than if you spent it elsewhere since there's a very high likelihood (essentially, close to certain) that the company you spend it with will exchange it for fiat anyway.  Either way, the organisation used the Bitcoin directly on something it needed (whether it be goods and services, or paying you) and what happened to it after that is none of the donor's or the organisation's concern.

While I personally think that it's a bad idea to exchange good money (bitcoin) for bad (fiat), there's nothing really wrong with it since every ""sell"" has a corresponding ""buy""; it's not like the Bitcoin just disappears out of the economy.";2;1;False;dalebewan;fg2xys8;How could we spend bitcoin?;ewkpc0;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ewkpc0/how_could_we_spend_bitcoin/

Well, it can be a problem if an attacker deliberately uses this situation to double spend.

These 0-conf lightning wallets can be difficult to understand, but I recommend that readers look at it this way: if you have unconfirmed bitcoins in a 0-conf lightning wallet, there's a possibility that the funding transaction might not confirm, and you'll lose your money. However, if you send a payment *from* a 0-conf wallet to a lightning wallet whose channels are already confirmed, it's no longer possible for anything bad to happen (except regular bitcoin/lightning stuff like if the recipient loses their private keys).

In short, the *recipient* can't be harmed due to the sender using a 0-conf lightning wallet. The sender and the 0-conf channel provider take on all the risk.";3;1;False;nowitsalllgone;fg37w1v;Question about Lightning and number of confirmations;ewisgh;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ewisgh/question_about_lightning_and_number_of/
"> If only the sender funds the channel, then spending from it over Lightning while it's unconfirmed actually reduces your liability, because it lowers the amount that has yet to be settled.

Is this really true? If i open a lightning channel with 100 mbtc, at that point there is no liability yet, no one owes anyone anything. It's only when i send 10 mbtc immediately thereafter (0 conf) that a risk is created. That risk isn't for me the sender or you the recipient, but it's there for my channel partner, who would stand to lose 10 mbtc they sent (from their output channel for that transaction) in the case that the funding transaction never confirms. 

So i think it's just the opposite: the act of sending before the funding transaction is final actually increases the amount that needs to be settled.";1;1;False;fresheneesz;fg3wm6x;Question about Lightning and number of confirmations;ewisgh;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ewisgh/question_about_lightning_and_number_of/

"I disagree, it does not depend on adoption of BTC itself. It depends on the adoption of the blockchain technology, which we all know is coming.

You see, once blockchain tech has revolutionized sectors, such as the financial industry, and said industry has adopted the technology, BTC can remain a niche cryptocurrency whose role is that of store of value.

At that point, you gotta ask yourself, OK then, HOW MUCH value?

Calculate with me: How about 1% of liquid assets worldwide?

40 trillion bonds, 30 trillion stocks. Call it 70 trillion, but there's more to liquid assets than these.

So that would give BTC a market capitalization of 700 billion US$ in today's money. That's roughly 5 times its market cap today. This is without accounting for other liquid asset types and the fact that the case can be made that, once blockchain is pervasive, BTC should be considered MUCH MORE than 1% of liquid assets. By comparison, worldwide gold value is about 8 trillion, so 11 times as much as my putative 1% of liquid assets.

A case can be made for BTC to fluctuate, certainly. But a case that it's worth any less than it's trading at right now? I don't think so, unless you call the whole Blockchain tech a sham.";1;1;False;Horrux;fg41dqb;Indeed;ewic0z;https://i.redd.it/fbs2behrd1e41.jpg
"I still disagree that BTC will be valuable if it isn't used. 

Mathematically and technologically speaking, bitcoin is an impressive idea. But fundamentally, if another coin comes out as faster, more usable as a currency, and with better technology, what really keeps bitcoin at a high price? Arguably almost only nostalgia at that point. It's the reason why coins like litecoin that have 4x the amount of coins aren't 25% of bitcoin's price. Litecoin right now is approximately only 1% of bitcoin's price, quite far off from the value of 25%, despite there eventually being 4x the supply. This is because it's not demanded as much.

So, if some technology becomes significantly better than bitcoin and all others, I don't see bitcoin retaining its value in that case.

A lot of people at this point are making a speculative bet on bitcoin becoming more valuable as it attains more adoption. If adoption suddenly slowed, as some better, more impressive tech came out, bitcoin would lose value. This is just basic supply and demand.";1;1;False;banditcleaner2;fg4a63f;Indeed;ewic0z;https://i.redd.it/fbs2behrd1e41.jpg

"And raping people in cages is the solution? I'm going to draw a hard line here: I don't think it's fair to spend $40K to $400K of other people's money because a possibly mentally ill person found $10 of the ""bad bad"" stuff. Moreover, stealing other people's money to rape brain sick people isn't moral, it's the things the sickest demons in the darkest parts of hell advocate for. And how those demons got people who think that their shit don't stink to advocate that horrendous proposition is beyond me. Make no mistake, I believe in heaven & hell, and I don't believe I am speaking in hyperbole when I say these things.
