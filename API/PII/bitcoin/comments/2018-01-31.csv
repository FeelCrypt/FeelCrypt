"I think That was a different situation entirely.  The bitcoin hardfork was to fix a critical bug in the code

In my opinion The DAO was a hardfork to reverse a hack because the people in charge of the DAO were friends with people in the ethereum foundation and people in the ethereum foundation were heavily involved in the DAO as well.  Also the hardfork was done because the foundation didn’t want a huge amount of ETH under control of a bad actor in the event ethereum moved to Proof of Stake 

The DAO fork was also done without consensus as many miners and the exchanges didn’t want the fork to happen (as evidenced by ETH Classic existing) ";-4;2;False;CalvinsStuffedTiger;dtj0td4;Bitcoin.. The King;7u9zbd;https://i.redd.it/4tl0oustqed01.jpg
They can't actually rewind the blockchain. He's referencing in 2016 when there was a giant hack, they did a fork to ensure that investors could have an opportunity to get their money out of theDAO.

BCH is just as bad as a hack solution. The blockchain size is already prohibitively too large for people to house their own wallets, further causing more people to rely on centralized services to handle their wallets, reducing the security and reliability of the network. The reliance on centralized wallet providers also make it no better than PayPal or banking institutions, which undermines the original purpose of Bitcoin. BCH makes that even worse. It isn't sustainable in the long run just to have bigger blocks. And it will still run into the same scaling problems when usage goes up.;-1;0;False;ggtsu_00;dtiwia5;Bitcoin..

Absolutely correct, it’s thermal variation from startup to operating and that cycle of cold-hot-cold is what plays havoc with components and PCB layer construction. If a GPU card or Mobo is at nearly constant temperature, if it doesn’t fail in first 6 months it’s likely to last many many years. Of course you need quality components on board.

Fluctuations are bad, sure. But so is running at 100% non-stop for months on end with potentially dying fans. I recently bought a secondhand card from a miner that was identical to a card I currently have and game on regularly. If I use both on stock clock speeds in the same machine, the card that I use is flawless, giving me really clear, artifact free benchmarks. The miner card has artifacts all over the place and I ended up having to under clock it, taking a massive hit to performance and decreasing my framerates significantly.

Why do gamers think this? My 4.5 year old GPU I use in my rig has handled a hell of a lot more abuse just in the last 6 months than any of mine or my friends mining cards and my gaming GPU is running just fine. Its been used damn near every day since it was bought, especially when I was job hunting for 6 months and would regularly play for 6+ hours a day with tons of temperature fluctuation. My mining cards however sit at under 65°c  with hardly any fluctuation. The only thing that might wear out in the next decade on a GPU are the fans. As long as the card hasn't been physically abused (which from what I've seen is much more likely to happen with a gamers old GPU) there's nothing wrong with GPU's used for mining.;1;0;False;icantfindaun;dtizhoa;Bitcoin..

"Flooding the market with shitty used GPUs would drive down the prices of new GPUs as well.  Assuming all the miners close up shop all that demand for new GPUs goes away and that drops the price.  Plus at some point as the price of old GPUs drop people decide to switch from new to old even if they're ""shitty"".  Render farms would happily take miners old cards--they're going to be buying in bulk anyway.  At the point where used GPUs were half the cost of new a lot of people would switch from new to used and figure they could just buy another one if the first one failed.

That is a myth btw. Only parts of the card that may see any sort of wear might be the fans.

"> They won't understand why they have to make large down payments far ahead of time before they can spend. They won't understand what channels they need to open up and why they have to pay into it as well.

They already need to make down payments ahead of time (buying bitcoins) before they can spend. By the time LN is ready for mass use (which it isn't now), the user won't be exposed to channels. Their initial buy will establish a payment channel with whoever sold them their coins, and if their software can't find a route for later purchases then it'll create a new channel automatically. 

> It doesn't just work transparently behind the scenes, and requires a completely different and more cumbersome user experience for the masses to easily adapt to.

How do you think it's different from [this demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_pTB8gCuvQ)?

"**Dunning–Kruger effect**

In the field of psychology, the Dunning–Kruger effect is a cognitive bias wherein people of low ability suffer from illusory superiority, mistakenly assessing their cognitive ability as greater than it is. The cognitive bias of illusory superiority derives from the metacognitive inability of low-ability persons to recognize their own ineptitude; without the self-awareness of metacognition, low-ability people cannot objectively evaluate their actual competence or incompetence.

Conversely, highly competent individuals may erroneously presume that tasks easy for them to perform are also easy for other people to perform, or that other people will have a similar understanding of subjects that they themselves are well-versed in.

">The demand for Bitcoin was from speculators who thought they could get rich quick from it. 

And what would initiate such a thing? It had been in a bear market for two years. It had been hanging around $200 for ages after hitting $1200. It did not look like a get rich scheme mid-2015 to mid-2016.

Only a sudden decrease in supply would initiate a new bull market.

And anyway - there's nothing wrong if people think it will make them rich. It fosters adoption. No one is buying Bitcoin or any crypto to buy stuff on the web.

>Bitcoin has the slowest transaction fees and times, is not anonymous, and can only be used as a coin, unlike other platforms.

"Untrue.  Mostly at least.

Lightning isn't centralized itself, as it's a mesh network where you can open a channel to X person, and if they have an open channel to Y, and Y has a channel to Z, you can transact with Z through the chain.  So there is no 'service' that a single entity can shut down, freeze, block, etc.  There also isn't any 'central' services that are technically in control of your funds in any way.

That being said, I do agree there is some worry and possibility LN could cause centralization, as that may be what is most convenient to the users, and LN *allows* centralization to occur a bit easier.

"> The DAO fork was also done without consensus as many miners and the exchanges didn’t want the fork to happen

There was a near complete hashrate consensus prior to and at the time of the fork, and none of the exchanges were opposed to the fork. 

The movement to keep ""Ethereum Classic"" alive as a separate coin only really became a thing **after** the fork had occurred, the return of hashrate and it's addition to exchanges happened well after the fork, hence why multiple exchanges were caught flat-footed and were drained of their ETC (that was supposed to be meaningless/worthless)

Coinbase, BTC-E and QuadrigaCX each lost substantial amounts of ETC as people withdrew Ethereum post-fork and received both ETH & ETC. ";8;0;False;fury420;dtj2wt4;Bitcoin.. The King;7u9zbd;https://i.redd.it/4tl0oustqed01.jpg
"Of course it was done with consensus, that's why the ETH chain is used over and above ETC. There were carbon votes taken at the time that showed overwhelmingly the desire to fix the issue. 

The key reason was the bad actor controlling a huge proportion of the eth. Look more recently at the parity wallet bug. No reversal/fork right now to fix that and that's Gavin Wood's baby, who arguably is as close to the eth foundation guys as can be.

"it's not worth hacking yet. The answer to that question goes beyond market cap, I know the average person has no idea what such a task would entail but people who are stealing shit have to think about fencing if it's for profit, and if it's not for profit it has to serve some other purpose worth some amount of money to them to take that risk. In the case of ethereum as soon as it's exploited the value is going to drop to 0$. Not 1$, not a few cents, but absolute 0, so until someone you or ""they"" (whoever they happens to be in this case) don't like, is holding a significant portion of their finances in ethereum it's unlikely to get crashed by an exploit or a hack. -edit- also, a lot of people seem to think that hacking means stealing, they aren't synonymous. Sometimes an institution getting hacked is someone coming to their servers and bombing them or setting them on fire or whatever destructive method serves the purpose those people have in mind. ""Hacking"" does not mean what the common person thinks it means. It is commonly associated now with digital theft, but just because someone took something doesn't mean they have it, or ever had access to it. (1). 2, the word originates from things being easier to ""hack together"" or ""hack apart"" with shitty code that sniffs and steals data, or simply redirects and loses it, than it is to build and run an organized program/website/database which both does what its function is supposed to be, and is an active deterrent to theft/intrusion/packet sniffing/exploits as well. The word hacking originates from engineering, (especially military) and was used as a reference to improvising solutions. Sometimes the simplest solutions are the best. ""hacking"" could literally be throwing the hard drive out of a window if you are instructed to ""hack"" a competitors PC's to cause them difficulty at the ""right time."" Programmers adapted the saying because it fit better than anything else to their task, which was not unlike engineering in that it's purely a function of logic. Because Ethereum is turing complete code, it can be exploited in some way or another. The possibilities are infinite and they are narrowed down the more is understood about the code (which, I'm sure it's open source lol.) Which translates to: It is only a matter of time until someone figures out a work around for stealing a significant portion of it, or simply destroying a significant portion of it in a very small time frame, but since it will likely destroy the value of the coin as well, this would only be worth doing to fuck someone over - it would not be profitable unless that somehow profited you.";-12;3;False;RiverXer;dtitemh;Bitcoin..

"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also Rick’s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they’re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick’s existential catchphrase “Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,” which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon’s genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

"You really do never know what you are going to get.  I am something of a bitcoin maximalist (have been since 2009) but am open to other currencies.  As a result of a collaboration with one alt (BCN, which is the coin from which Monero was forked) which at the time, a few years ago, was 63rd or 65th on the crypto market cap list (it wasn't worth much at that time, relative to some other decentralized cryptosystems), I was able to get an idea integrated into BCN that at the time simply would not have been possible to have been integrated into bitcoin: small, but voluntary microdonations (as an option in the BCN graphical wallet, either from mining or just from transactions).  see http://abis.io for some details.  That was back in late 2015. (Today BCN is 28th on coinmarketcap, it usually has been ranging now somewhere between 20th and 25th, but the past couple days have been rough for all cryptos, though they will bounce back.)

In bitcoin, there was a bit of a waiting game for segwit to activate (now it's activated) and for lightning to become available (now there are hundreds of lightning nodes, though it is still in testing) both of which are preconditions before http://abis.io can be developed in a bitcoin wallet.  (See also a colleague's project (u/ktorn) - http://subsatoshi.org/ -- which will likely find eventual further development and application as lightning development proceeds.)  I think the voluntary microdonation concept envisioned originally and implemented in BCN can soon be developed in the form of a bitcoin GUI wallet that has that same feature.  

Interestingly, BCN and bitcoin have some of the same features now (bitcoin picked up some stuff that was originally present in BCN).  See:

1) https://blockstream.com/2018/01/23/musig-key-aggregation-schnorr-signatures.html

and

2) https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/56nk94/on_chain_scaling_with_schnorr_signatures/d8lmzrf/

"The Lumia 625 is what killed Windows Phone for me. And the lack of apps. Yeah, you had an MS RDP app that worked great, and WhatsApp was available too. But not a whole lot of apps that I use on iOS/Android were available. And the 625 was a POS. At work we had a bunch of them and every single one would randomly freeze or even crash and turn off. Every time MS said it was going to be fixed by the next update, but even with Win10 the issues remained and got worse no matter what you did. I was even told by MS to remove the battery (which would require a screwdriver and voiding warranty). Sent it in for repair and as soon as it came back it crashed again.

"Not sure I agree with you there.

I got hacked off with Windows the other week and installed Ubuntu. Everything worked straight away. Spotify, Steam (despite running a 7850 rather than an nvidia card), Silverlight in Firefox, the free office seems to have leapt forward.. I found open source versions of all the server/storage/disk utilities I need for work. The only reason I've switched back to Windows (I have two SSDs, one Ubuntu one W8.1 and an early UEFI BIOS that allows this) is because the framerate in CS:GO is marginally better.. But frankly I can't see a non-gamer having a problem. ";1;0;False;desk_fan;dthn06v;The Free Software Foundation has received a 91.45 Bitcoin donation from the Pineapple Fund.

">What's the Pineapple fund? I love Pineapples and would just help out based on that.

According to the link provided by OP:

The organization was started in December by an anonymous donor who goes by the nickname “Pine” and claims to be among the 250 largest holders of Bitcoin in the world. The fund aims to give away $86 million worth of Bitcoin, and has already given $20 million worth of the currency to 13 organizations, including million-dollar donations to the Water Project, which provides clean water to people in sub-Saharan Africa, and the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights watchdog.

(These donations can be verified thanks to Bitcoin’s digital ledger system, which records every transaction in a public database.)
