"Or maybe the owner wants to encourage the use of bitcoin, to grow the ecosystem.

Or maybe the owner wants to reduce the amount of cash on hand...

Or maybe the owner wants to just let his customer decide what payment method suits _the customer_ the best.

The point is, more businesses ARE accepting payments in BTC, and they do so for whatever reason makes sense for them.";1;0;False;AManInBlack2017;dukn7us;Bitcoin Doesn't Give a Fuck.;7yaaz2;https://v.redd.it/ty2y74gawug01
"> Or, and I'm just spitballing here, they accept BTC because the owner wants to accumulate more...

Why couldn't they just accept cash and then buy bitcoin with it? A business owner might want to accumulate more gold, it doesn't mean they're going to start accepting gold as payment

you already said that the only reason you shop at those businesses was to spend bitcoin, which is why the business offered it. It wasn't because you were going to shop there anyway and bitcoin was the better payment option, which is what needs to happen for organic growth.

Cash is quicker than bitcoin and cash depreciates so its always better to spend first if you have some (which obviously you do because that's how you ""replace"" lost bitcoin).

What value does it add to the owners business other than the gimmick of attracting people who will only go there if they accept bitcoin?

 Cash costs them nothing, is quicker, everyone has it and they have basically no risk of cash losing half its value between getting it and trying to spend it.

If the owner wants bitcoins to speculate on they can just buy them using fiat.
