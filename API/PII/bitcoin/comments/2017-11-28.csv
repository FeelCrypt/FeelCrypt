"> I'm not spreading FUD, you are spreading irrational exuberance.

Pointing out that the most talented cryptographers with programming experience are developing the most advanced solutions for bitcoin is ""irrational exuberance"" ?

The problem is you are not only make a incorrect assumption, you are also doing it out of context.

>Yahoo? Kodak? Lehman brothers?

Yes, you can cherry pick as many failures as you like. But the raw truth is that if you have 10 companies and 5 of them put minimal effort into their product and 5 put maximal effort into their product, the maximal effort companies are statistically much more likely to succeed.

>Number of people working on something doesn't mean much if they aren't well managed and working in the right direction.

Then its a damn good thing we have literally the most intelligent cryptographers with the most experience possible in this industry leading the way with their vision, eh?

I don't know why you keep pretending this isn't the case, but you are looking more clueless every post.

I got my first .1 at $5000 before that I had .006 from $500 and now I’m at .14 so pretty new to bitcoin considering when I got my first .006 bitcoin wasn’t seen as much of an investment as it is now. And after I had .1 my gambling or in this case sensible side got that up to .14, not much for a lot of people but it’s a lot for me working in a supermarket with managers that treat me like garbage.;1;1;False;Ge0rgeWKush420;dqfhvqz;It's over 9000!!!;7fkqh5;https://i.imgur.com/jyoZGyW.gifv
