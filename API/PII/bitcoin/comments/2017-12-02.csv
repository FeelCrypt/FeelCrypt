"There are plenty of periods of times where deflation has occurred and has not cause recessions. My point about it being made up was more about ""deflation is more dangerous than inflation"". I do agree that rapid change in a currency is going to mess with a market, especially where you have sticky prices and fixed contracts (due to the prior expectations of a stable currency) but this is irrelevant to whether it's inflation or deflation. There are far more examples of runaway inflation causing issues than the other way around.

Any argument that can be thought of against deflation on the technical/nuts-and-bolts level can be applied to inflation equally (and often times is more applicable to inflation) just by flipping the question.";1;0;False;out_caste;dqo4kq0;It's official! 1 Bitcoin = $10,000 USD;7g9cd3;https://v.redd.it/e7io27rdgt001

 I got it at a 50% discount to the ticket price, I buy the dips and spend on up days. The bitcoin I spent is worth more now, but once it leaves my hand it isn’t mine anymore.

Do you have or use bitcoin? Through Coinbase I got a shift card, it swipes anywhere they take credit cards. Whenever I swipe, they transfer the approximate amount of bitcoin (usually +10 to 15%) to the card. When the transaction settles, they credit the difference back to bitcoin in Coinbase. This works anywhere that accepts credit cards, not because San Francisco. ;1;0;False;mixologyst;dqnt2tu;I hope James is doing well;7gla05;https://i.redd.it/h4ngqma643101.jpg

No, it couldn’t. We’re at a time now that the actual “investment” the regular Joe’s are throwing down is big money for them. Years ago if someone had a couple hundred in Bitcoin, and it crashed, no big deal. But because of its past, people are putting down their entire savings into Bitcoin. If it crashes, they will lose everything. That’s the difference and it’s something you all seem incapable of admitting, or realizing.

"**Paradox of tolerance**

The paradox of tolerance, first described by Karl Popper in 1945, is a decision theory paradox. The paradox states that if a society is tolerant without limit, their ability to be tolerant will eventually be seized or destroyed by the intolerant. Popper came to the seemingly paradoxical conclusion that in order to maintain a tolerant society, the society must be intolerant of intolerance.

"The point I was making is that the stuff has no inherent value to fall back on. It is a bubble and unless people stop treating it as an investment and start using it as a currency (and I mean on a massively larger scale, like I can go to a drug store and pick up a box of Tylenol and pay with bitcoin), I’m very unconvinced it isn’t just a speculative bubble.

I mean obviously I could end up being very wrong. It could end up actually replacing or reinforcing standard currency and then go on to continue increasing in value.

"By swing trade?

Daytrading is pretty self explanatory and longterm investing as well. Swing trades are an intermediate.

Basically a swing trade is when you see a price swinging around a resistance point for a few days or weeks and buy it on the low swings, sell it on the high swings. Such as BTC has been doing swinging around the 10k landmark price.

For a while you could set your watch to $AMD falling to 2-3 bucks because Intel was taking over the world, everyone crying bankruptcy, then swinging back to $4 when people bothered to look at their finances. It was easy pickings for anyone who noticed the pattern.

A blow-off top is when a price rises too fast and abruptly pulls back — not necessarily because of bad news but just because impulsive or ""weak hand"" investors decided saw a scary steep line and decided to cash out. Like when these mainstream journo dorks were reporting 11k back to 9k as a ""catastrophic plummet! bubble has popped! oh no!. They can be prime swing trading targets.";4;0;False;lonely08;dqnf8nw;Eleven!;7gzr64;https://i.redd.it/07te6jshxe101.jpg

No more time to tell how
This is the season of what
Now is the time of returning
With thought jewels polished and gleaming
Now is the time past believing
The child has relinquished the reign
Now is the test of the boomerang
Tossed in the night of redeeming
Eight sided whispering hallelujah hatrack
Seven faced marble eye transitory dream doll
six proud walkers on jinglebell rainbow
Five men writing in fingers of gold
Four men tracking down the great white sperm whale
Three girls wait in a foreign dominion
Ride in the whale belly
Fade away in moonlight
Sink beneath the waters
to the coral sand below
Now is the time of returning";2;0;False;;dqnhueb;Eleven!;7gzr64;https://i.redd.it/07te6jshxe101.jpg

"It’s a gamble. I see this is a bubble that will eventually burst and never recover. The fact that this sub exists, and is in the state that it is, should tell you something. Would you trust these people with your money? I, for one, wouldn’t.

Or it could keep on keeping on and become the new world currency. But I highly doubt that. This seems like a fad more than anything, and when it inevitably crashes, I just can’t fathom it recovering. Too many people will be burned in such a way that they will not be able to recover. A lot of people “investing” in bitcoin are putting almost all of their money into it because they see others making insane amounts of money. Problem is, when it crashes hard, a lot of people will be left with absolutely nothing. At that point the hype train will be gone, and it will never return, because of the crash. That’s my theory at least. Everyone here will disagree with it though, because they’re not legitimate investors and they didn’t diversify worth shit, and this idea scares the living shit out of them.

Edit: Also, the stock market is likely going to take a fucking nosedive if the tax bill passes. It’s a complete repeat of the 1920’s leading into the Great Depression. If that happens, Bitcoin will fold.";34;9;False;BLMdidHarambe;dqnb3hl;Eleven!;7gzr64;https://i.redd.it/07te6jshxe101.jpg

When bitcoin grows by 20%, your capital grows by 20%. The same is true for litecoin. It doesn't matter which cryptocurrency you buy.
