This is great that you're donating a lot of money, however, it seems like you're giving mainly to charities that are already well established.

Donate to things that will help the development and use of ...useful... cryptocurrencies around the world to bring the bankless out of poverty, and create new wealth. I.e. new DNS servers, blocks on top of existing coins to optimize functions of pretty much all services. Cut out the middle man, and corruption. Create new jobs. That's probably a safer bet than charities as its hard to know exactly how the funds are spread out unless you , yourself, are buying things and handing them out to ___. ;1;0;False;Scaredleon-Felriath;dsj9erw;I'm donating 5057 BTC to charitable causes!
