This basically means full node and preferably Tor as well. It has nothing to do with on-disk.

>high-value

To do high-value, you need good security. Windows has poor security. An offline air-gapped Windows may do the job, but you seem to want it to be online. The only way that you can use Windows online and have high security is by using a hardware wallet. Buy a Trezor. Either use it with Trezor's backend, which comes with a full node, or use it with Electrum, a Electrum server, such as Electrs, and a full node. Either way, you need a Linux server.

You now have a lower hashpower securing the network, but the value of the network is also smaller as the price fell. The system was designed to always maintain an appropriately secure level of hash power for the current market cap.

Think about the first few years of Bitcoin's existence. The market cap was only in the millions, so it would be inappropriate to be spending millions of dollars on energy just use to secure the network. A few hundred enthusiast doing GPU mining was securing the network at that time. Today, Bitcoin is holding $170 billion in people's wealth.

If you controlled 51% of the hash power, you can re-org the chain, either to censor transactions or attempt to double spend your own coins.

"It is a difficult choice, its always hard to assume a loss. But I think that I would cut it and take that 50% resting.

There is a risk of going almost 0% on one hand, and on the other hand you still have the chance of hopping on btc before halving, what probably could help you recover part of your losses.

There is a possibility that you wont recover them all because now you need a +100% to compensate the -50%. But bitcoin going +100% this year is not crazy either.

I read once that the main reason why 70% (I think that it's even more) of """"traders"""" and investors lose money is because we tend to grab benefits too son due to fear of screwing up, and also to stop losses to late because we don't want to assume a mistake and hope for a recovery that normally doesn't happen.

However, at its core, Bitcoin is meant to remain decentralized, peer to peer, and free of any greater influence. So Robinhood also goes against these ideals by being a centralizing agency.

Ya UBI is literally capitalisms answer to income inequality. Without UBI or alternatatives to it capitalism will inevidably see the rich get richer and poor get poorer. Wealth redistribution is the only way to maintain a capitalist system. That can be done in a few different ways, but UBI is one of them. Communism would call for a complete takeover of private industry by the workers. Depending on which flavor of communism you like that could mean coops or it could mean government.

"A couple things I don't see mentioned here:
1. If people don't hold their own coins they are not running and using their own nodes, thus not really 'peers' in the peer to peer network of bitcoin. IMO if you aren't really participating as a peer you will never fully understand or appreciate what bitcoin is.
2. Keeping coins on a large exchange (especially one bragging 1m btc in its posession) is the consolidation of wealth and power of many in the hands of a few. This gives exchanges like coinbase heavy influence over user funds, data, ability to represent/speak for their interests to government bodies, hold coins arbitrarily, censor transactions, etc. This is not only problematic for the users in specific use cases, it is major centralization of power which goes against one of the core ideas of bitcoin: decentralization.";1;0;False;GapeJelly;ffzc38u;What are the pros and cons of keeping cryptocurrency on an exchange;evyz3l;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/evyz3l/what_are_the_pros_and_cons_of_keeping/

"I think everyone that is new to coinbase or buying crypto on coinbase is a bit apprehensive about moving coins to a cold wallet.  Maybe scared they will lose their coins in a transaction or  something will go wrong and not be able to recover them.

I suggest you do the following (and it really is not that hard)

1.  Buy a Nano S or Nano X wallet.
2. Watch a few you tube videos on how to set it up (maybe even watch few times)  note: some videos maybe outdated with old leger.live software so find most current.
3. Read the manual .. which will make more sense after watching the videos.
4. Make sure you wallet has the latest firmware... can update it from ledgerlive software.
5. Make sure you save your 24 word seed in a very safe place - most important.
6. Transfer a very small amount of coins from coinbase to your wallet.
7. Then transfer the small amount from your wallet back to coinbase.  You wallet is worthless if you can't send tokens
8. Then wipe your wallet on purpose (with wrong pin number 3 times)  and restore it with your 24 word seed.  Do this with no tokens to make sure you know how if you lose your wallet, it gets damaged, or you forget your pin to open wallet.
9. Then move all your tokens from coinbase to your wallet and chill.";1;1;False;road22;ffza9gc;What are the pros and cons of keeping cryptocurrency on an exchange;evyz3l;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/evyz3l/what_are_the_pros_and_cons_of_keeping/

"I imagine that you will get a lot of simple answers like ""not your keys - not your money"" and such. That is true, but life is not that simple. There are risks to keeping your own keys as well. You can screw up somehow, forget a passphrase, misplace a seed, expose it inadvertently, get hacked and so on. The risk is, probably, manageable, and can be reduced with practice and education on the topic, but it is not zero, and can be quite high for a newbie. And it is not clear if it is lower than storing on an exchange. You decide for yourself. If the amount is small, you may want to relax, and trust the exchange, but on the other hand, you may want to experiment and learn how to keep your own keys before you have a large amount to worry about. Decide what you want to do. If it is your long-term investment and you are willing to spend time figuring things out, then start learning. You do not have to transfer the whole amount.

"If you want to purchase BTC anonymously, you have two choices: F2F (face to face) exchange, or via a P2P (peer to peer) platform like Bisq. There's no KYC, but you'll start with low trading limits in order to guard against fraud until your account is signed by a vetted peer, in which case your limits will be lifted 30 days later. There are several different options for payment methods (Zelle, MoneyGram, ChasePay, Money Order, etc.), and only your trading peer will be privy to your personal information. The program runs as an app locally on your machine and there are no 3rd parties to censor or restrict access to your funds. In the unlikely event of a dispute, there are dedicated mediators and arbitrators to assist with resolution and a Bisq DAO which acts as an insurance policy for funding loss recovery. Like all 3rd party software, it is recommended that you verify the PGP signature of the binary to ensure it's authenticity, and if you're not familiar with this process, learn - it's a non-negotiable skill if you're going to be in this space. ""Don't trust. Verify""

&#x200B;

As for anonymizing the coins that you've purchased from Coinbase, the easiest way by far is to use Wasabi coinjoins. If you don't have the minimum amount required to coinjoin (\~0.1 BTC), joinmarket would be the next best option, but requires running your own node and takes several days for your coins to achieve a high anonymity set. If that's not appealing to you, the 3rd best option would be to use Bisq to swap your BTC with XMR (Monero) and then back to BTC to break the transaction history that ties you to those coins. Just be aware that no matter which option you choose, there's a growing trend of KYC exchanges blocking these ""tainted"" coins due to AML (anti money laundering) policies, so once you anonymize your coins or purchase P2P, there's a good chance that you will not be able to sell them on Coinbase at a later date. All the more reason to support P2P and protect the fungibility of the platform, as far as I'm concerned. Let me know if you have any questions and I'll try to help in any way I can. Good luck!

"Are you trading on  basic coinbase or ""coinbase pro""?

If your trading on just basic coinbase your going to pay really large fee's and spreads.  If your just betting on the price and don't care about holding tokens then just get a robinhood account because TRADES ARE TOTALLY FREE (no spread no fees).  But on robinhood your only betting on the price nothing else.

If your trading on ""coinbase pro"" are you using ""buy/sell limit orders"" or do you sit there and watch the screen 24 hours a day? 

If you are going to keep your tokens on coinbase then buy a UBF security key and set up the 2 factor google authentication.  Also contact your cell phone service and put a password for No PORT on your sim card.  But if you use a UBF security USB key on your account... keep at least one of them in a safe.

"Even 2 factor authentication can be hacked.  All they need is to take control of your cell phone.  If somebody knows your phone number and knows you have a lot of crypto on coinbase... they go to a new service like Tmobile/Verison and impersonate you and say I would like to switch my phone service.  It is not hard to do.   Once they get control of your phone number they reset passwords for email and coinbase.   You can put a password on a SIM PORT but some have been even breaking those.

I bought a USB security key and use it to lock my coinbase, and gemini account.  Nobody could access these accounts without the key.  But I keep very little on the exchanges because tokens on exchanges can be confiscated for absolutely no reason at all.  Somebody wants to put a judgement against you and there is a paper trail from your bank to coinbase... your cryptos can be seized very easily with a court order.

I used to trade on limit orders but I hated paying the fees and spreads on buy and sells.  If Bitcoin is trading at 9000 then you have to pay a percentage fee on the buy (if you buy $1000 worth will cost you $15 commision) and you have to buy it at 9050.  But on robinhood there are absolutely NO Fees  or commission. But you don't own the coins just bet on the price.
If you don't put the coins in your own possession or wallet it is the exact same... you dont really own them.  That is why I suggest just bet on the price with no commission.";2;1;False;road22;ffzelvt;I finally own 1 bitcoin!;evvz1y;https://i.redd.it/p02ji4or4td41.jpg

"Using BIP44 mnemonic codes and passphrases, I am willing to bet the former. Governments today have completely given up control of their nation state currencies to large banks. The next collapse will have banks hyperinflating nation state currencies to bail them out.

Laws will be passed forcing citizens to exchange hard money for soft money. The illegalization and liquidation of gold in 1929 during the Great Depression will occur with Bitcoin. The banks will freeze then seize Bitcoin on the exchanges and denominated owners to be reimbursed in dollars.

Although it’s technically possible ledger have engineered a backdoor the odds are extremely remote and if they were to do it they would have already done it. The concept of a master seed phrase and the generation of a tree of private and public key pairs is publicly available and verifiable  and although it’s true it’s technically complex, the concept has been around for a while and just works, and therefore should be trusted.

"That might be true, but only in a rather insidious way. The story the next generation grows up is just as often a popularity contest. Only after 2 generations (when the 2nd generation sees that the 1st generation can't explain itself) does the truth get found. 

Case in point, the Copenhagen Interpretation of quantum mechanics has been the def facto standard taught to everyone for almost 100 years at this point. However, the dissenters (Einstein, deBroglie, Schrodinger) were never convinced it was a reasonable point of view. 

Now, because of sheer chance that the couple physicists that supported the Copenhagen interpretation were popular (to the point of reverence), pretty much everyone is taught that, despite the fact that it makes absolutely no sense. 

The best scientific truths do indeed triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light. Newton did it, Einstein did it, Schrodinger did it, and tons of other scientists.

If you buy at $9,300, your risk to return is 100,000/9300 or 10.75/1. By waiting to enter at 8500, your risk to return is now 11.76/1. Per my risk appetite, this is not worth waiting..

"Well I'll be damned, a lot of bad advice here for the kid.

You probably won't like this advice, but I think you should take a note of it.

Firstly, don't skip your breakfast. It's the most important meal of the day. No investment should sacrifice your health! Furthermore, your mum is giving you this money out of her own pocket and love to ensure her son stays fed and healthy. You are betraying that trust and love.

Secondly, the only (legal) way to buy bitcoin under 16 (as far as I know) is to use the Bitcoin kiosks which charge up to 25% more than online exchanges. The fact that you have an absolute maximum of $25, that 25% is going to hurt a lot.

Now, let's say everything goes absolutely perfectly and you manage to invest $25 every weekday for 1 month. You have invested $100 in BTC and have only $75 worth of that because of the above mentioned maximum 25% charge, at the exchange of skipping breakfast 20 times and lying to your mom. Doesn't sound like a great idea to me.

Finally, if you really want to invest in Bitcoin, I'd really ask you to do it in a way which doesn't involve skipping meals or lying to your parents. Get a part time job. Mow lawns, clean shoes, clean houses, baby sit, ANYTHING! You want to buy Bitcoin, right? Fine, set that as your goal, now you need to put in the extra work to be able to afford your goal. Be willing to work a bit extra during the day.

I'll give an example of myself. Me and my wife started our own business almost 2 years ago. As other families, we have responsibilities, bills, rent, food, clothes etc. We earn enough money, around $10k a month. But as many others have mentioned, you don't invest any money into BTC you are not willing to loose. I am not willing to loose any money that my family earns for us. So, what did I do in this situation? I worked more. I started a separate business which involves solely myself and only operates while my daughter is at school so I don't waste any family time.

Phew, sorry this post is a bit long but you are still so young, and it's awesome you want to get into Bitcoin, but you really need to prioritize life and the well being of yourself and family before investing in Bitcoin. If you have extra energy and time to spare, absolutely do some extra work, make money and buy Bitcoin!

Goodluck and stay healthy kiddo.";1;0;False;Feahh;ffzizw8;I’m 15 and want to invest in bitcoin;evpatx;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/evpatx/im_15_and_want_to_invest_in_bitcoin/

Sure, simplest being the experience of buying/selling large chunks of btc versus selling btc.  If I put a chunk of fiat onto an exchange the money will take a few days to clear through the traditional banking system (why you can't withdraw right away).  Contrast that with the experience of selling where the bitcoin is in your exchange account with no restrictions as soon as it's written into a block.  However, trade it back to fiat and send it back to your bank account and there is that nasty traditional bottleneck of bankster middle men taking their sweet time to change the entries in their outdated SQL databases.;1;0;False;RookXPY;ffzj7st;When the bull begins its run.;evoqzi;https://v.redd.it/6jwxcwujpqd41

--------------------------

**Escrow Disputes**  

a) You purchase something digital on an escrow platform like a digital giftcard or another digital item instead of receiving your physical product before releasing your escrowed BTC. After releasing the BTC they sweep the funds from the gift card .  With these types of services only buy physical items you can inspect.

b) They attempt to communicate with you with another service like whatsapp or discord or email off the normal communication channels within the escrow service making it harder for the escrow agent to investigate any claims

c) They convince you to save money and not use escrow and simply do the trade in private, thus removing your ability to make a dispute";1;1;False;bitusher;ffzm9iu;Daily Discussion, January 28, 2020;ev23bq;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ev23bq/daily_discussion_january_28_2020/

"I agree with you, but only partially. As I said before, I have been using this account for more than 2 years. And the amount of operations was significantly more than $ 5000. If you assume that they decided to verify me because $ 5,000 is enough, why didn’t they do it before when the amounts were much larger? Therefore, this is not an argument. 

You also say that they did it to comply with the law and so on. They are not a tax agent to worry about this. If they really complied with everything, they would require verification from the very beginning, not allowing customers to deposit funds. But it turns out that they lure customers into a trap - you can deposit funds, but not withdraw

It is also worth noting that my account was inactive several times - for 2, 3 and 4 months. And every time after it was inactive for so long, I logged in and immediately withdrew coins from it. And everything was fine. And this time, after 6 months of inactivity, I logged in and made a deposit! and only then withdrew and got blocked.

Therefore, I really think that the account was blocked for one of several reasons:

1. By mistake. Perhaps the inactivity trigger worked for 6 months. But my support team is not willing to listen to my arguments

2. An attempt by HitBTC to appropriate my funds, as they have already done so many times judging by the numerous complaints of a huge number of users.";1;0;False;cioruidi;ffztb3e;One more victim of HitBTC;eumk86;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/eumk86/one_more_victim_of_hitbtc/

"Actually, I understand Lightning completely. I have a masters in Computer Science.

Even IF they manage to make it work perfectly, and it's user friendly, it's still fundamentally flawed - and will not be adopted.

(That's a big IF by the way. It's a very have computer science problem that has not been solved before, and there's no evidence that they'll be able to solve it. Good luck to them.)

Even IF they manage to do that though - why would anyone use it? It's literally taking everything that's great about Bitcoin, and undoing it by adding middlemen (banks) back into the picture. 

For a technology to be adopted, it has to be SIGNIFICANTLY better than what it's replacing. Not just a little bit better, SIGNIFICANTLY better.

Lets compare Lightning to my VISA Credit Card;

- If I get phished/hacked/scammed, I'll get my money refunded by my bank with my VISA. Goodbye money with Lightning. This is problem inherent with all crypto.

- If I get locked out of my account (forget passwords, logins, anything), the bank will be able to restore my access. Goodbye to all of your Lightning/crypto.

- VISA is already accepted everywhere in the entire world. Until Lightning is at parity, it's simply worse.

---

What does Lightning do better....? 

- Uh... it doesn't use banks, which I guess is nice? Though that means you lose a lot of the amazing services banks provide.

- APPARENTLY the transaction fees will be lower, but that's unknown, and honestly unlikely. If there is worldwide adoption, there will be a small few mega-Lightning Nodes which most transactions pass through. Those nodes determine the fees. There is little doubt in my mind that they'll charge significant fees. It'll just be like the banks all over again.

---

Lightning is removing one of the most fundamental parts of cryptocurrencies (no middlemen) and moving crypto back toward something like the banks already provide.

It WILL NOT succeed.

Bitcoin needs on-chain scaling. Not some scummy side-chain solution purely designed to re-add middlemen who just want to get their greedy hands on tx fees.

Bitcoin has not had any significant on-chain scaling in the last decade. Yes, there's been a few minor upgrades. But upgrading from 3tps to 7tps is not significant.
