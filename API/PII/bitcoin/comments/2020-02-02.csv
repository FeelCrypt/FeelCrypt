It should bounce back to Coinbase because they can't deposit money into a closed account. You may have to contact Coinbase to make sure it goes back into your Coinbase account. If Coinbase drags their feet, you might have to contact your bank to prove to CB that the money didn't go into your bank account. The bank has nothing to do with making sure CB funds your CB account though, because CB doesn't transfer anything from your wallet directly to the bank.;2;1;False;MostBoringStan;fgdd0ce;Need some help if possible;exw2mw;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/exw2mw/need_some_help_if_possible/

"## Bitcoin is not a Ponzi Scheme.

In a Ponzi scheme:

there is an ""operator"" -- a central authority (one person, or a small group), a swindler.

The swindler receives money from people

The swindler promises investors that their money will be invested in some business venture with an expected high rate of return. That money is NOT invested. There is no money-making business venture. Any returns are paid from the swindled money.

The entire Ponzi Scheme is based upon a big, fat lie.

The Ponzi scheme can only keep going so long as new suckers arrive to put their money into it.

A Ponzi scheme cannot survive a ""crash"".

A Ponzi scheme is illegal and immoral.

Bitcoin is legal, and honest.

Bitcoin has no central authority.

Bitcoin is purchased from other Bitcoin owners and/or multiple exchanges.

Bitcoin makes no promises about ROI.

Bitcoin is not, and does not pretend to be a ""money making venture""; Bitcoin IS money.

Bitcoin has survived several crashes.

Bitcoin can keep going without any new investors.

It's about as risky as giving cash, and I'm sure that most of my political contributions get stolen by some volunteer, but I'm fairly certain that some get through.

Talking about negative interest rate as if that is anything but pure insanity. Causing unacceptable levels of inequality with asset price bubbles enriching those at the top. 

The last 100 years there has been 50 instances of hyperinflation. Millions are lives destroyed and lost. Gold doesn't hyper-inflate, bitcoin even more scarce than gold.

I had been wondering this myself.  Someone on /biz/ posted what was claimed to be a screenshot of the instructions, and it says that airdrops mean ""yes"".

There were apparently three attempts at airdrops last year, one of which succeeded -- a fork of BCash called ""Bitcoin Cash Zero"".  I have no information on what happened to the other two;  as far as I can tell their developers committed seppuku when they realized they weren't gonna make it.  I hope the BCZ developers do the same.

It supposedly trades as BCZ (but there is ANOTHER coin that also uses/used that ticker symbol).  I have been unable to find opening prices from when it started in January 2019.  It hit an ATH of about $0.80 in June 2019.

https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin-cz/

Anyway, if you are a longterm hodler who never dumped your BTrash bags, you're stuck checking ""yes"" and you supposedly owe the IRS a few shekels for whatever you got in the airdrop even though you probably never heard of this shitcoin before now.

">Where did you get $100 for 0.003 from?

When people do this though experiment they have to assign a value to what the average citizen of earth has in terms of net worth. $100 is his estimate. 

He then goes on to state that there are however many millionaires and billionaires who could presumably buy up many of those coins leaving less than 0.003 for the rest of us. Assuming they still wanted to store their $100 net worth that simply pushes the price of Bitcoin higher. 

Then he reminds us about the other large financial entities who will own even bigger chunks of Bitcoin, leaving an even more miniscule amount for the rest of us, and hence a higher Bitcoin price. 

People do this though experiment all the time and the main takeaway is that if Bitcoin succeeds, you will have a tonne of people storing their wealth in fractions of a coin. 

I however am very curious how we would ever even get there given the inability to even onboard a billion people onto lightning network in any reasonable timeframe. How on earth will we solve this conundrum. I personally would sooner give up the insane growth to keep Bitcoin smaller and more decentralised than do what bcash did...

No, it's impossible to shut it down ""at no cost"". Even with ""lots of costs"" it's impossible to shut it down, but it's theoretically possible to cause a lot of disruption (which perhaps might lead people to lose trust into the network), if you have access to large amounts of resources (= money, electricity, hardware).

"One thing I could imagine is, that a government could put so much hashing power into the system (maybe additionally including all miners in that country as well, forcefully) that they would be the ones to find all or almost all blocks, basically rather a 99% attack than a 51% attack. Then, they could decide to leave all the blocks empty, so that all bitcoin transactions come to a halt. They would intentionally have the blockchain running in an empty mode, maybe for months. I don't see how bitcoin could survive such an attack, the price would crash to zero and any other miners wouldn't be able to cope with the mining costs, so they would have to shut down. Any attempt to do a hard fork, they could just repeat their attack on the fork. Stopping the attack after some months would of course lead to kind of a technical revival, but everyone would have lost all their investments, the dream of liberty and independence would have been shattered to pieces, and it's clear that the attack could be performed again at any time.

"Bitcoin vs altcoins feels a lot like gold vs silver, platinum etc.

&#x200B;

There seems to be a phenomenon where societies gravitate towards giving one ""system"" (gold, or in this case, bitcoin), the bulk of their attention, while other metals/coins, though similar and some times even ""better"" in terms of utility and scarcity, are not proportionally represented when it comes to how the market ends up valuing them.

&#x200B;

This is probably the network effect occurring: the more people that use a currency, the more valuable it becomes, and the less people that use a currency, the less valuable it becomes.

&#x200B;

If everyones using that currency, then the developers are also incentivized to develop for that currency. Which, again, increases its utility, which increases adoption, which increases value, which again leads to people opting to develop for that coin instead of another, less valuable coin. Its a vicious cycle.

&#x200B;

Sort of like the app store and the iPhone. If everyones developing apps for the phone that your company makes, then the phone becomes even more useful, which leads to more people buying the phone, which means more people are going to buy apps for that phone, which, again, steers developers towards developing apps for THAT phone, rather than another phone (never ending cycle).";1;2;False;10a8s9a;fgcr82w;Seifedean Ammous on why Bitcoin and not some other coin;exlmmc;https://youtu.be/Zbm772vF-5M?t=3045

Can you show me a typical IPO graph of stocks? Like, say, Apple, or maybe Uber or something in which the IPO is massively high, and then the price radically drops and moves sideways for a really long time? Or do most stocks typically rise over time? In my mind, the 20k of Bitcoin two years ago, was like it's IPO in that suddenly everyone heard about it for the first time, it became wildly popular, and people talked about the 'new thing' so everyone bought in, then it tanked. I wonder, based on typical stocks, how long til it will reach 40k based on what a typical stock might do? (I know it's not a stock). If we compare it to real gold we can expect an up and down chart but it will very gradually go up year over year, which is what is happening. I would love to know what the expected timeline, based on year over year averages, it would hit 40k.;0;1;False;tommygunz007;fgc930t;Daily Discussion, February 02, 2020;exknce;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/exknce/daily_discussion_february_02_2020/

"> only fee that I was made aware of was the ATM fee of $1.30

You're ignoring the ATM's markup. Before you add cash to the ATM, the ATM screen displays the price you are paying. You should be comparing this number with the price at coinbase.com or some other reliable Bitcoin price quoting source. When you add your cash to the ATM, it tells you how much Bitcoin you're buying. If you divide dollars by Bitcoin, that also tells you the price being charged by the ATM operator  

No Bitcoin ATM is profitable with a $1.30 fee per transaction. They all charge the customer a higher price than their own purchase price. Different ATM operators charge different prices. The markup is typically between 6% and 15%, sometimes more than 20%, sometimes only 2.5%  

You apparently paid 10%

Basically it’s a loan. You ask at your bank for a credit margin. Based on your credit score/revenue , they will allow you to borrow up to a certain amount of money instantly with an interest usually around 6-8%. Then you transfer the amount of money you need from the credit margin section (in this scenario 9.5k for example) in your personal bank account (which is all done on the bank website) and then your send your money on an exchange like Kraken for example via wire or directly paid by debit (limited per day tho). And finally you buy your BTC. Then you will reimburse your loan every month. If I am not mistaken minimal payment every month has to be 2%.

Say we're at 9k right now at a given equilibrium, but let's assume that demand is highly inelastic.

If we cut the supply in half, with demand being highly inelastic at our given equilibrium, we may well see a tenfold increase in price as opposed to a twofold increase.

Good move. We know for sure that there's only 1 Bitcoin and there's a huge financial crisis coming. Trillions will flow into safe haven assets. Bitcoin has the most to gain from this and it is proving itself at exactly the right time to be a truly portable, fungible, unconfiscatable, decentralized safe haven asset backed by a massive hashrate and a risk-averse proven development history spanning 11 years. No question Bitcoin will ascend to a much greater valuation when the over-inflated global money supply and realized scarcity of Bitcoin sets in.  The masses won't care about the thousands of alts.

Yeah I get what you mean. I have thought lots about my decision. I'm not for one second saying that I'd never buy an alt coin again but I'd never buy it to hodl, it'd be just for gains and then those gains would go in to BTC, BTC is the only coin I'd hodl. I've looked a lot in to charts and I noticed that it doesn't matter whether it's an old-ish alt or a new one, they tend to have their ATH within the first 6 months, usually between 3-6 months. I may invest in some new projects (only decent ones) but look to get out within that timescale and be careful to not get greedy. People go chasing 1000x gains and obviously it's possible but unlikely now, in reality a 10x gain is amazing.

Exactly: value is relative to other assets.

"Yes, values change over time. But how do we measure value? And how do we measure its change? In the case of goods and services, it's measured in fiat: the market of buyers and sellers, meeting together at the margin, have determined that this painting is worth $10,000.

Let's take a van Gogh painting. Back in his day, few people valued his work, only willing to pay a few hundred Francs. But what does that mean? How do Francs compare to US dollars? How do their respective inflation rates compare? Or perhaps we could figure it out by comparing those few hundreds francs to the cost of living at the time. But what was their standard of living? And how does that compare to ours? There are so many questions as to how the painting was valued that it make it impossible to paint an accurate picture.

Now let's assume that bitcoin was around at that time and the buyer had paid 0.001 bitcoin for the painting. Today, that same painting sold for 2,000 bitcoin.  With everything pegged to bitcoin then and now, all the earlier questions we had of local currency and standard of living is already discounted in the price paid in bitcoin. Its fixed supply is the full representation of worth and value at any given time. While the painting became more valuable in and of itself, value is a zero-sum game: value was pulled from something else and directed toward the van Gogh painting because the painting became more valuable at a much larger rate than most other things. That can all be measured with a bitcoin yardstick.";1;0;False;SufficientRadio;fgbrvq7;A Global Standard of Value: Utilizing Bitcoin's Fixed Scarcity to Establish a Universal Constant of Value;exeidl;https://medium.com/@PLK5280/a-global-standard-of-value-c36dcdf5090d

The best idea I've learned with cryptocurrency is to dollar cost average that means right now put in 20% of what you would like to buy and then if prices go down in the next month put in another 20% this will help you get the right price by always buying low. And if it goes up either way you do good because you have money in the game. And if it goes down right away you don't feel bad because you're getting better prices. I began to dollar cost average in from 10,000 all the way down to 6.9k and now have a great investment by continuing to buy as prices fell.

"> 1) cash can be stolen much much easier. Ive definitely had cash taken out of my wallet a couple times when I was being careless. Same hasn't been said about my card.

You can be stolen only the maximum amount of cash you are willing to lose.

Lose a card? They might steal way more than you even thought about.

>2) change. At least in America prices are never rounded to the nearest dollar, so I am forced to have a change jar to put all my $1 bills and coins. Which I then just bring to the bank anyways.

The idea of change is that you just give it back in the next store. I normally just have a few coins in my pocket and i get along in any country (different currencies). Just learn to count.

>3) more items to keep track of. I only have like 3 cards max to keep track of. If I break a 20 or a 50 I might have up to 10-15 bills to organize and keep track of in my wallet

No idea what you meant by this 15 bills of the lowest euro amount is still €75 and maximum €7500.. So i can easily tell that i almost never have 15 bills in my wallet..

Keeping track of cash is way easier. You can do it two ways, just logging your transactions in a note, or just spent and forget. If you open your three bank cards and see hundreds of transactions of 1,- here and 2,40 at PAYMENT STSTEMS INC is way more inconvinient imo..";0;0;False;Bitcoin_puzzler;fga6qb4;Buy bitcoin instead;exbhoe;https://i.redd.it/d1sg9gxe9de41.jpg
">cash can be stolen much much easier. Ive definitely had cash taken out of my wallet a couple times when I was being careless. Same hasn't been said about my card.

Whoever can take my cash can also take my cards. And my mobile phone, and keys.

Getting robbed sucks, period.

As for getting stolen, that's just careless. Don't leave stuff lying around, don't put your wallet in your uncovered backpocket where you don't see a thing and feel little.

>change. At least in America prices are never rounded to the nearest dollar, so I am forced to have a change jar to put all my $1 bills and coins. Which I then just bring to the bank anyways.

Money taken out never goes back to my own bank account. I used to collect coin-change and put that in once a year, but for the past 5 years now my account is at a bank which does not even have local branches.

Spending down change isn't even hard, until you're like 90. You just need to buckle down once and not let things get out of control. When you ended up with enough coins to make several bills, you done messed up.

Same on all these reasons, but another huge one for me is that as long as you pay off your credit card full balance monthly, a credit card is free money. It's honestly kinda irresponsible financially to not use one, if you're spending over a grand at least in expenses a month. I'm talking the points rewards or cash back, many offer 2%, some rotate 5%, plus if you go over to /r/churning you can easily get $300-$600 value in rewards points from new cards every once in a while. Plus fraud protection, if I get my cash stolen I'm fucked. If I get my card stolen I can call the company pretty quickly and even if they charged my card the company can cancel and charge back any fraudulent usage.;2;1;False;DacoLordo;fg8yt29;Buy bitcoin instead;exbhoe;https://i.redd.it/d1sg9gxe9de41.jpg

Thats a good thing for the economy. If you buy stocks you give money to a company. The company uses this money to employ people or buy machines which also employs people. Those people also use the money, and so on. In the same time you hold your Bitcoin, the currency created three times value and payed three people. If you hold currencies nothing happens with the money and the economy stands still. A healthy currency loses slightly in value so people don't hold it to long. Thats on purpose and not because the currency sucks. Switzerland for example has an extremly strong currency, which causes a lot of problems. The National Bank of Switzerland weakens it on purpose to avoid that to many people buy Swiss Francs as an investment.

"Yes, but over the long time they are meant to lose slightly (slightly if the economy is healthy) in value.

Bitcoin increases its value in the long term, which causes a lot of economic problems. I explained them more detailed in a comment above. This makes Bitcoin a good investment, but a bad currency.

"Don't confuse paper wallets with seed backups or seed cold storage.

Download a wallet listed on Bitcoin.org. Write down your seed. Store it securely. Have more than one copy/backup. Don't overthink it - losing it is far more common than theft.


And actually, this right here is exactly why we down vote people who recommend ""paper wallets.""

"In order to be valuable, a thing must be both scarce **and** useful. Moon rocks are scarce (on Earth), but they are not useful, aside from being a status symbol.

You might be right here, but people like naming their commodities. A thousandth, tenthousanth, ..., millionth of a bitcoin are clumsy to throw around your mouth for practical use. So, its divisiblity is no problem, but consider this: most of humanity is still buying their groceries in markets, and haggling is still considered polite in some cultures. Then there is still to question of transfer. Something that might work in the cities of the western world, will most likely not work in the countryside worldwide. It's like mobile phone signal: no matter what generation of wireless internet we have, I at my house have no signal. No GSM, no G4. I live 14 km away from my nations capital, which is a member of the EU. I can't receive a digital TV signal, and DAB will be limited to the highway network. I see this might be even a bigger hurdle in the rest of the world, If I can't have any digital wireless signal in a first world country in 2020, if I leave a major highway.;1;1;False;sloaleks;fg8orv4;#2025;exaas5;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/exaas5/2025/
I feel it is more similar not to the internet, but the network types. Like, for instance, optic networks and the various Gs. Optic networks remain a staple (still). But in the wireless world, we are rather quickly hopping through the Gs. The fiat currencies will remain our staple, like optic networks, and cripto currencies will be just an addition, not even meant to be spread worldwide at the start. I think it will similarly take many generations of these virtual monetary systems to reach most of us.;1;0;False;sloaleks;fg8nh5c;#2025;exaas5;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/exaas5/2025/

"1. Guessing private keys one at a time, then seeing if the public key holds a balance.

2. Pretty much the same as generating keys normally in a wallet. But doing it over and over really fast. 

3. Due to the large keyspace, the chances are far smaller than any human can reasonably comprehend. Saying 0% is an acceptable way of communicating this.

> The script was able to brute force any 4-digit pin in under 2 minutes.

That yields only 83.3 pins per second.  At that rate a pin like 987654321 would take years.

Also the new [sd-protect](https://github.com/trezor/trezor-firmware/blob/master/python/docs/OPTIONS.rst#device-management-commands---setup-recover-seed-wipe-etc) feature on model-T allows you to encrypt the FW with full AES-128 bit encryption instead of relying on a pin.

Other than that... yes, use a passphrase.  The attack only works on wallets without passphrases.

Some merchants may actually care about Bitcoin and keep the BTC received for further transactions on their own.

Other merchants may route the payment through a service provider that gets to keep the BTC while putting a Dollar-debt towards the merchant into their balance sheet (or send a dollar-transaction to the merchant immediately).

"**Over-the-counter (finance)**

Over-the-counter (OTC) or off-exchange trading is done directly between two parties, without the supervision of an exchange. It is contrasted with exchange trading, which occurs via exchanges. A stock exchange has the benefit of facilitating liquidity, providing transparency, and maintaining the current market price. In an OTC trade, the price is not necessarily publicly disclosed.

The best single step to further protect your seed is to encrypt it with an extension word (seed extension) use a long complex password and write it in your password manager. Use something you might remember (if you can) and store several copies of your encrypted seed on multiple geographical locations (to protect them from natural disasters) on tamper evident containers inside safe boxes if available. It's also a good idea to fire/water proof them. Check them once in a while.

"Well, he clearly doesn't do any financial transactions of note or even send money across borders. Anyone who does will immedeatly understand the value of even a 1 hour delay. And it's quite frankly more like 30 minutes and that is IF you use Bitcoin which is completely the wrong vehicle for money transfers anyway. 

Ripple is seconds, yet despite that someone moved $400 mil in Bitcoin the other day for 36c cents. 

So the reason he doesn't understand the value of Bitcoin is because he doesn't have a life. Simple as that. And he should probably worry less about Bitcoin and more about getting out a bit.

Actually a bitcoin transaction is instant. Confirmations are only necessary to be sure you didn't get ripped off. If someone accepts a credit card at their business, they will be payed at the end of the month, and at any time someone can report the card as stolen. Compared to that on chain transactions are wonderful.

"There is a common scam you may be falling victim to:

In blockchain.com’s wallet, you can import an address as a ‘watch only’ address. This means the wallet will watch the address, and display the funds to you. 

They way the bitcoin blockchain is architected, addresses are public info, so anyone can do this. But to spend the funds, you need to know the cryptographic private key that created that address. Only the person who knows the private key can move those funds. 

So there is a common scam, where the scammer will import a watch only address to a victim’s wallet, and tell them it is the ‘profits of trading’ or something like that. The scammer may not even own the address imported - it could literally just be any random address. 

The scammer will then ask for payment to ‘unlock the address and make it spendable’, or something like that. DO NOT SEND MONEY. This is not how bitcoin works, it is a scam.

"i dont really understand your solution, but i know bitcoinABC is implementing avalanche and pre-consensus as a solution that will allow some kind of quick semi-confirmation.

I don't know how 'quick' this is, it might actually take 20-30 seconds. It will certainly be slower than zero-conf. Where some wallets wait a bit for the txn to propagate with no observed double spend.  This is to slow for POS terminals these days. 

By the time this is implemented - after all politics and drama I don't know what state the LN will be in.

I used to support BCH, but then they added automatic reorg protection and I got the impression that bitcoin ABC was slowly accumulating more and more power.  They were being subversive and trying to character assassinate BU as being BSV supporters. This almost succeeded i saw the comments in r/btc.

"zero-conf relies on the first seen rule - which is a mere social convention. Its like the convention that satoshi said lets not mine with GPU's to allow more CPU miners and it will harm decentralization. 

Imagine if we said let's not mine with ASIC's, nothing in bitcoin will stop people mining with ASIC's and eventually it will happen.

It's the same with the FSR, one day some pool will implement full rbf or will directly accept transactions that can be replaced but will accept a bigger fee due to increased profitability. zero conf will be instantly broken.

The only reason this hasn't happened yet because of pure mining centralization. there are only a dozen 'real miners' and the rest just operate asics. With the betterhash protocol implemented its very likely this rule will be broken soon. 

Zero-conf is not a type of bitcoin transaction its just a social convention that you do not try and steal pending transactions currently implemented by the limited amount of miners.

When someone asks me if they should buy bitcoin, I’ll tell them “Well, I only accept tips in bitcoin, but you should not buy bitcoin.  You should learn about bitcoin.”

If they do that, and if they eventually understand it well enough to disregard my instruction, then that means they saw the value of my argument *and they already have bitcoin with which to tip me.*

The free-market theory is nonsense. There is plenty of evidence that demonstrates that FMT requires a bunch of assumptions to operate well that are inconsistent with reality such as the myth of perfect and symmetric information, rational actors, and costless transactions.

>I did not consent to those laws. They did not justify those laws.

Grow up. We were all born into circumstances beyond our control, everyone else from every society has had to learn to deal with that reality. You are not above the laws. Sucks to suck, but that's the truth of it.  You're the one conflating morality with financial privacy as if the two were synonymous - they aren't. History and society continue to show us that financial privacy is incredibly damaging to the world. Just look at what's happening in the American government. If even a lick of transparency was happening your democracy would not be on the verge of collapse, yet mysteriously you want to increase the capacity to hide financial crimes and behaviors?  That is fucked up.

>That can be used to justify any tyranny and immorality. ""You shouldzn't have hidden z(TH)ose Jews from ze gaurds"" . you are just a victim blamer.

Again demonizing using with Hyperbole. Stop expecting life to baby you and disrespecting the people that made actual sacrifices in WW2. Those people risked their lives knowing the punishment if they were caught. There was no expectation of the Nazi's sparing them. They knew the risks, and what it would take to make a better world.

"Your argument is based on a lot of emotion and not a lot of evidence. A lot of logical fallacy and persona attacks in there too, but I'll break things down for you piece by piece. 

Most drug trafficking is done by major criminal gangs who can afford to smuggle and manufacture shit into the country. By the time it gets trickled down to your 'homeboy' who's dealing dime bags for ""self-healing"" you're essentially taking meth and opioids which have become an epidemic in the western world and killed a lot of good people, young and old. That's why fentanyl and carfentanyl kill so many. Cocaine is another great example of a substance that even if you manage to get a clean product there was a lot of harm committed to produce for your entertainment. Reality is the things you're purchasing aren't tested, even the LSD, and it puts people at risk, much in the same way that taking tainted alcohol would. What's sad is that the people who pay the price are often not the people most responsible for the harm being caused. 

I'm glad you understand this principle - then you understand that concepts should not be applied the same in all circumstances. It should be very simple to grasp then why in this context privacy is appropriate because in this circumstance you are being actively hostile. Financial transparency doesn't mean i give you the keys to my identity and let you in.

Similarly when you are saying you need to protect yourself from the state you are saying that you are voluntarily taking actions which put you at risk. THAT IS YOUR OWN FAULT. If you contradict the laws of your society that is your responsibility to manage - but all you've done is prove the point that you are attempting to avoid personal accountability for illegal behaviour based on what you feel is right or wrong rather than what the society at large feels is right or wrong. It is not society's responsibility to cover your ass for dumb decisions. play stupid games, win stupid prizes.

Having reasonable limitations on people is far from authoritarian. You're just attempting to label me negatively so you can attack my character rather than disprove my argument. 

Society needs governing bodies to give us all laws by which to live by - this is a natural evolution that came about because people are fiercely social creatures that use co-operation to survive. Without it societies do not function because not everyone shares the same values and people will take advantage of each other if regulation isn't in place. The entire shitcoin market is a fantastic example of this. 

This argument isn't about the drug-war but given the straw-man and heavy lean into this conversation I'd wager you likely use a variety of drugs recreationally, so let me use this piece to make something clear. I'm a big proponent of the decriminalization of drugs. Scientific evidence suggests that decriminalizing and legalizing them actually is better for society. However, given that most are illegal for the time being - I don't pursue them and stick to the things I am allowed to participate in, and I don't expect society to protect me if I choose to do something in direct contradiction with the system. 

The war on drugs has been a colossal failure and ruined the lives of many people who don't deserve to sit where they do. Socioeconomics tell us it has been devastating to low income communities. But so have the drugs themselves. I work towards changing the system by advocating for changes from within the system, because outside of military revolution, that is the way it has always been done. 

There is plenty of evidence to demonstrate why financial privacy and ""dark money"" is bad. feel free to conduct some research on it. The world is a lot more complex than ""authority bad,"" ""Privacy Good."" so for the final time i will re-iterate, Privacy in many contexts is appropriate, however people like to take advantage of the system - just look at how ""tax dodging and evasion"" has allowed companies to absolutely fuck up the economic equality to damage the middle class. The idea that you should be allowed to do whatever the fuck you want all the time because you feel like it is childish and so much harm in the world is created by people who believe this.

Then you would have a situation similar to Bitcon. You would be the holder of an instrument that pays nothing.;1;1;False;Expensive-Button;fg8omsy;The Empirical Proof of Bitcoin's Real Value Being Zero;ewqyue;https://youtu.be/WSYTXmxPveY
But the whole point is that you cannot invest in Bitcoin as Bitcoin is neither tangible property nor financial instrument that pays you some monetary or non-monetary value. You can only buy Bitcoin. But by buying it, you transferred your actual value into the hands of Bitcoin seller. After that you have literally zero value, you have only a number attached to your virtual address. And numbers cannot save you from a tyrannical government.;1;1;False;Expensive-Button;fg8pewu;The Empirical Proof of Bitcoin's Real Value Being Zero;ewqyue;https://youtu.be/WSYTXmxPveY

Yeah in my own experience I've only ever seen the coinstar machine bitcoin ATM's. They're usually in super markets and require you to upload your ID or Passport and charge pretty outrageous fees but they're also pretty convenient. I can't speak to if there are ATM's here in the US that don't do KYC but to me it seems like they would be far and few between considering all the US based exchanges require it.;1;0;False;Draekus;fgcr1ye;"Rotterdam The Netherlands - Bitcoin ATM ""Temporarily out of order due to new legislation"".

I know exchanges block US IPs, I just thought ATM's were somehow different and that KYC was being implemented everywhere, reading your comment, yeah it makes sense that KYCs are asked for in the US but other places may or may not enforce KYC.;1;1;False;conhela;fgcp8as;"Rotterdam The Netherlands - Bitcoin ATM ""Temporarily out of order due to new legislation"".

"'Natural' commodities in general don't have marketing, although cryptos are almost all corporately owned and often have marketing, except for Bitcoin, which is more of a community commons in practice.

In the US, milk now has a marketing budget, and runs ads in print and TV. To some extent, I would in a similar way argue that Gold has a marketing budget, provided by governments that make gold 'currency'. These coins are not normally used as legal tender, but instead sold to speculators and collectors, but they do in some way encourage the holding and use of the underlying metal, and quite a few countries offer official gold coins.";1;1;False;HODL_monk;fgdapgy;Indeed;ewic0z;https://i.redd.it/fbs2behrd1e41.jpg
