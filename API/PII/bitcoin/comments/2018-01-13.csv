"Hi pine!
You should definitely consider donating to 
www.human-connection.org

It`s a social, knowledge, and action network.
It sort of connects a crowdmoderated, ad-free, open source social
media platform without a filtering algorithm (to avoid echo chambers) with a knowledge platform like wikipedia. 
For those who want to get into action after reading the content, there will be an action-button which guides the user from information to possible actions (institutions like greenpeace for donations etc.).

The goal is to provide sound knowledge, to stop waisting time scrolling on platforms like facebook and *get into action in the REAL WORLD.*

Here`s one of their videos: [To bee or not to bee?!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpf9f7D25zE)

The network will start its alpha phase at the end of January 2018 and currently runs its crwodfunding campaign on 
[Indiegogo.com](https://igg.me/at/humanconnectionorg).

Please donate for this network with the potential to *CHANGE the WORLD* for the better.
