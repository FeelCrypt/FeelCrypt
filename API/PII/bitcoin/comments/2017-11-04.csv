when you invest in something like the stock market, or futures, or a business or gold or something, it has inherent value. bitcoin does not. the marketplace is speculating about nothing, and sooner or later it's going to come to crash hard and lots of people on this board are gonna lose money. i would just be careful, is all i'm saying. i've already known folks who have lost 10s of figures from bitcoin, and this is before governments have tried to kill it. so either bitcoin stays pretty much worthless and the bubble will burst, or governments will outwardly try to destroy it. ;1;1;False;fandongpai;dpcqxbm;Lily Allen turned down 200K in Bitcoins for a gig in 2009 which is worth $1,426,199,000 as of this writing;7aq0fx;https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/lily-allen-calls-herself-an-idiot-for-declining-bitcoin-payment-now-worth-millions-9046211.html

"It works just like the stock market. People (and bots) set buy and sell orders. If there is an order to sell at 7k and an order to buy at 7k, the transaction is completed. The going rate right now is around 7k, meaning, your one Bitcoin will sell on the market at around that price.


Traders often set limits on buying and selling to protect themselves from selling too low or buying too high. You can look on Bittrex and watch the buy and sell orders get completed in real time. It is selling, right now, at around $7000 per Bitcoin.


If one entity were to put up a thousand Bitcoin for sale at 7k, the price would drop as the ""sell wall"" would be consumed by other buyers. If the price were to drop to $6900, other sellers asking $6900 would sell their Bitcoin while the $7k ""sell wall"" would just sit there, not being purchased. The overall asking price would slowly drop as more of the large quantity of Bitcoin is sold off. As more and more Bitcoin gets purchased, the price might climb back to $7k, at which point, the sell wall would continue selling off its Bitcoin.


It's a free market - purely supply and demand (and whale manipulation heh).

I mostly agree! But I think ""wider acceptance"" and ""mostly-flat value"" are conflicting right now, and will remain that way for a while. Transitioning into wider acceptance is going to continue to drive bitcoin's price way up. Lots of people are learning about it for the first time and wanting to buy in.

"**Pyramid scheme**

A pyramid scheme (commonly known as pyramid scams) is a business model that recruits members via a promise of payments or services for enrolling others into the scheme, rather than supplying investments or sale of products or services. As recruiting multiplies, recruiting becomes quickly impossible, and most members are unable to profit; as such, pyramid schemes are unsustainable and often illegal.

Pyramid schemes have existed for at least a century in different guises. Most multi-level marketing plans fall into a sub-group of pyramid schemes.

"The problem you are identifying is that BTC is by design deflationary. Since there's a finite amount and each block is harder to discover the value is going up and up and up. As much as inflation seems like it screws you over (I'm paying $1.89 for a soda that used to cost me $0.99) it encourages spending in an economy - why hold your money if money loses value sitting on the shelf, so to speak. BTC is the opposite - why spend today if it will continue to grow just by saving?

You see stories about people that could have made fortunes by buying in early but what about those that used it as currency early? Those first users that bragged about being able to buy a pizza with BTC probably paid $7000 USD by today's exchange rate for that pizza.

"I actually completely agree with you.  It's more just a case of the wording.  Feel free to re-read my post as ""able to lose without experiencing hardship"" rather than ""willing to lose"".

Since I do not expect BTC to ever become stable at any price point other than much much higher than it is now or exactly zero, I don't really consider a fall in the $/€ value to be particularly meaningful unless it's caused by something that fundamentally destroys the whole system (in which case, it's going to zero and will stay there).  When I talk about ""losing"" though, I am really only considering that zero case, since if we assume it's not going to zero, it'll rise again, and will rise higher than where it fell from.

"While it is of course possible, I think that realistically the chances of it going that way are extremely low.

Everyone seems to be aware that the more acceptance bitcoin gets, the greater the value; but what seems to be somehow less often talked about is that the more acceptance it gets, the lower the volatility.

I personally think we're already at a point where the value of bitcoin is almost (but still not quite) large enough for it to be a 'safe' investment, and by the time that the bottom of the typical dips is around $20k USD, I expect many others will see it that way as well.

There is still a lot of speculation of course and there will be periods where 'mass panic' causes larger swings, but those early days where single whales could influence the market significantly are already well behind us.

My long term expectation for the value of bitcoin (measured against something stable, not other currencies) is roughly an S-curve with some wild swinging along the way making it fuzzy.  I also think there is a reasonable chance that it'll significantly overshoot the top of the S curve before coming down, bouncing a little, and eventually settling at a reasonably stable top.  There will therefore be people who sell that one and only 'real bubble' who will do well out of it.  I won't be one of them, because I don't believe that I'm capable of timing that and will be quite happy with the stable settled price.

It's true of course that I could change my opinion in the future.  And if I do, I'll of course act on my opinion as it is at the time.  That might mean I sell at $20k or $50k or whatever; but right now, I don't see any sensible reason that I would.

My current view of fiat is that as an inflationary currency, I want to hold as little of it as possible.  Why hold something that just decreases in value over time?  But, since I still want to maintain liquidity, I won't put it all in ""hard assets"" that are difficult to sell quickly or in highly divisible units (e.g. real estate; selling a house to go grocery shopping is just stupid).  Bitcoin is the perfect thing for maintaining that liquidity.  I of course do hold other assets as well, but other than a ""just in case of emergency"" reserve of fiat (enough to keep me and my family with a roof over our heads and food in our bellies for around 12 months if we're frugal), all my liquidity is in bitcoin.";4;3;False;dalebewan;dpcaqtu;Lily Allen turned down 200K in Bitcoins for a gig in 2009 which is worth $1,426,199,000 as of this writing;7aq0fx;https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/lily-allen-calls-herself-an-idiot-for-declining-bitcoin-payment-now-worth-millions-9046211.html

Saying “this previous bubble popped at point X, so this similar bubble will probably pop around the same point” is very flawed. I’m never going to buy something because someone tells me “it’ll be worth more later”, unless I really think that I know something that the market as a whole does not, which is definitely not the case given the amount of attention bitcoin gets. I have no idea if the price of Bitcoin drop to 0 tomorrow, drop back to about the current level after it breaks 10,000, or stabilize at 50,000, but I do know that a commodity that is valuable because people believe it to be valuable is a very risky investment. ;3;1;False;;dpchnkq;Lily Allen turned down 200K in Bitcoins for a gig in 2009 which is worth $1,426,199,000 as of this writing;7aq0fx;https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/lily-allen-calls-herself-an-idiot-for-declining-bitcoin-payment-now-worth-millions-9046211.html

Bitcoin seems like a pretty good investment but a terrible currency. Its value fluctuates far too much and there's a limit to how much of it can ever exist.

"Sort of. You just have to bet on the right horse.

Bitcoin's value goes up based on speculation of mass adoption, adoption that is fueled by hopes that the value will go up. Bitcoin is now being seen as a store of value rather than a form of currency. There's nothing wrong with that either, and it's not a bad idea considering Bitcoin is deflationary (like gold) while every reserve currency is inflationary and valued by each other. We live in a world of floating exchange rates. 

Gold didn't work because the central banks had to hold it for the populace to exchange currencies for - thus disallowing the use of monetary policy. Bitcoin is different in that there is no centralization. With Bitcoin, the populace has all the ""gold"" and nobody can truly restrict its exchange unless the entire internet is taken down.";1;1;False;nwatn;dpc7w7i;Lily Allen turned down 200K in Bitcoins for a gig in 2009 which is worth $1,426,199,000 as of this writing;7aq0fx;https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/lily-allen-calls-herself-an-idiot-for-declining-bitcoin-payment-now-worth-millions-9046211.html
"So let me try to maybe reposition the angle you are looking at bitcoin from. So in short I got into BTC because i believe it could eventually be a demilitarized competitor to State fiat money. Many of us are very passionate about the downsides of corporate lobbying, Nation building, the military industrial complex and so on but we can't really do anything about it because we all use US dollars. If enough people choose to stop using US dollars we are essentially taking away the power at the real root. We could essentially bypass the Fiat money systems and create circular economies dealing just in crypto if we get enough people to adopt this technology but if I'm being honest that probably wont be for another 10 years at least (satoshis vision was that it would take 100 years for majority of people to adopt) and may never happen if something catastrophic happens or if USA criminalizes it etc... BTC still just barely a toddler in dev phase imo and very much a baby adoption wise. but This is also why its' interesting to note that in the [""genesis block""](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Genesis_block) the first Bitcoin block mined by satoshi he left a message for us that is a headline from an article back then ""The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks""

have you ever sent or received crypto before? I'd be willing to send you 0.1LTC (about $5.5) if you have never had the experience, just download Loafwallet on your phone and send me your public wallet address : ) this usually helps people understand the utility a little more.

"It's conceptually a mix between creating it and assigning it to you. No one has it before you mine it so I wouldn't say it can be transferred from nothing to you.

Mathematically they created an equation that has large numbers as answers, only some of those large numbers are valid answers to the equation. Mining is the process of testing each large number to see if it is a valid answer. When you find a valid answer (if you are the first to find it) there is a bounty for finding it and it is paid in bitcoin assigned to the miner or group of miners that submitted the valid answer. The mining app then transmits that record out to the blockchain so that everyone knows that answer is taken and they exclude it from further testing. Occasionally more than one minor will find the same answer within a small time period and the chain picks one and builds from there leaving the other as the unlucky one.

Why it takes computing power is because if it didn't one person would have all the bitcoins as soon as he created it. Making it take effort distributes the wealth to those that do the work. Making it take more effort over time keeps it from being infinite which would cause inflation and make the coins worthless.

"> No offense, but people thought similar things about IT companies in 1999

No offence taken... but I'm confused by the statement.  Reputable IT companies (not just ""dot coms"") have generally done well since then.  There was a clear bubble when you look at stock price histories, but that doesn't mean they all just died.

> The internet was amazing and there was no way the new technology would fail.

Yep, that still seems to be true today in fact.

> Maybe you're right, or maybe another crash like the one in 2014 happens, only this time bitcoin never recovers and something else takes it place. I really don't see why you'd think that risk is extremely low.

Because the value of bitcoin is *not* based solely on speculation.  As I said in my post, there is a lot of speculation and it does cause volatility in the price - essentially mini-bubbles within the overall trend - but since there is inherent and unique value, the price should reflect this.

It is possible of course for the inherent and unique value to be replaced by something else, and so yes, it could all crash down to nothing.  However I don't see any practical way for that to happen at the moment.  The main value of bitcoin compared to other cryptocurrencies is the size of the network (making it inherently more secure because that's how blockchains work).  This is kind of a self-reinforcing factor for the most part and would take something pretty significant to change it.  If something comes along that actually does ""dethrone"" bitcoin, there should be enough warning signs to move my liquidity over to that instead, but again, I still can't see any realistic way for that to happen right now.";5;2;False;dalebewan;dpcev3g;Lily Allen turned down 200K in Bitcoins for a gig in 2009 which is worth $1,426,199,000 as of this writing;7aq0fx;https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/lily-allen-calls-herself-an-idiot-for-declining-bitcoin-payment-now-worth-millions-9046211.html
"Bitcoin doesn’t meet the 3 requirements for a currency very well at the moment.  1. Facilitate exchange of goods and services. Bitcoin isn’t very good at that yet, it isn’t very widely accepted. 2. Store of value. The price fluctuations make it not very strong in this regard. I would feel much safer with my money stored as dollars in a checking account, although it does have some advantages over paper money. 3. Unit of account. I guess it does this fine, but people know the value of $10 much better than they do .0018 Bitcoins. 

Maybe bitcoin will be a great currency in the future, but it is not a strong one at the moment at all. That’s why I think people are for the most part buying it for speculative purposes.

THen I burned that wallet.dat to a CD and tossed it in a drawer.

once they hit like $700 each I moved to another more encrypted wallet (still burned to CD) Then I renamed a encrypted .rar to .jpg (attempt to be sneaky) and uploaded a 'pic' to gmail so I'd always have it.

Once it hit $3000 I got a Trezor, once it hit 6000 I got a 2nd Trezor.

"There has been one true bubble in the history of bitcoin and that was in 2013 when the price soared past $1000 because of manipulation by the owner of Mt.Gox. Bitcoin lost most of its value when this bubble popped. It was such a trauma that the price took a couple of years to recover. Bitcoin is much more healthy now that there are many exchanges all around the globe.

There have been crashes on a fairly regular basis, typically because of scary news. These crashes have done a decent job at showing that the price is grounded in reality. Every single recent crash has been resorbed quickly because investors believe in the utility and potential of the technology enough to keep their bitcoins and because the influx of new investors continues to grow. The technology is innovative and objectively good. The rising price has put bitcoin on the radar of regular people. The Internet saw the same type of growth when it started becoming mainstream as opposed to just a den for nerds in the early 2000s.

Bitcoin isn't splitting in two. The original bitcoin will continue to account for nearly all the capital. An alternative cryptocurrency based on bitcoin will be created and most likely fail. A group is trying to hijack the development of bitcoin from the developers that are trusted by a majority of users. Bitcoin can easily weather attacks like these and has done so in the past. The only drawback is that it's a bit technical and that investors will have to be cautious about who they trust for a little while.

If this attack fails, it's unlikely that there will be other attacks of this magnitude in the future. If the attack unexpectedly succeeds, investors who haven't taken a stand won't be losing their capital since their bitcoins will exist in both cryptocurrencies. Investors who take a stand by selling their bitcoins from the cryptocurrency they don't believe in while keeping their bitcoins from the cryptocurrency they believe in will even have an opportunity to earn some free money like they did with BCH (bitcoin cash).";4;1;False;Exotemporal;dpch7pl;Lily Allen turned down 200K in Bitcoins for a gig in 2009 which is worth $1,426,199,000 as of this writing;7aq0fx;https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/lily-allen-calls-herself-an-idiot-for-declining-bitcoin-payment-now-worth-millions-9046211.html

"> Because the value of bitcoin is not based solely on speculation.

There needs to be a distinction between *value* and *price* IMO. Bitcoin derives value from being a store of wealth but also being available to use as a currency. Someone mentioned a day or two back that the price has shot up 5x in the past six months but transaction counts have remained essentially unchanged. Whether using it as a currency or as a store of wealth both would involve transactions, yet the transaction count is stable. 

So the price is currently being driven by speculation and holding not usage. Which implies it will come back down after some exogenous shock. The question then is what will the new equilibrium price be, which I suspect will be above its previous ~$1k ceiling but less than the $5-7k range lately. But who knows. That is all predicated on the current price being the top of the bubble, which has been the prediction for whatever the current price is for months now.

As I said I simply trust their leadership more as they don’t have to run for re election in s few years and are intelligent to be in bitcoins inner circle. ;1;1;False;Let_It_Steep;dpcauxp;Lily Allen turned down 200K in Bitcoins for a gig in 2009 which is worth $1,426,199,000 as of this writing;7aq0fx;https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/lily-allen-calls-herself-an-idiot-for-declining-bitcoin-payment-now-worth-millions-9046211.html

As far as your concerns of innovation, it's already begun. There are several cryptocurrencies that people argue are ""better"" than bitcoin in certain ways which have massively increased in value in the past couple months/years. In fact one of the reasons bitcoin has increased in price is because a lot of the markets for these coins are traded using bitcoins, so bitcoin is increasing in price not only because of its inherent value, but also because it gives access to the larger crypto market in general.

When you put loan money to someone, they pay you periodically. That’s not the loan getting more valuable, that’s an interest payment. When you hold stock, the company pays you periodically. That’s not the stock getting more valuable, that’s a dividend payment. Those payments give those assets worth beyond the face value. If I buy a bond thinking I’ll be able to sell it for more later but the market for them crashes, I can just collect the coupon payments until it matures.

"Very easy. Say you make an account on Coinbase. For legal reasons (mostly to prevent money-laundering), you need to verify your ID on the exchange account (you submit ID to them via your smartphone / iPhone). 

Assuming you had Bitcoin in your Coinbase wallet, you would just click ""sell"" from your Coinbase wallet, and it sells the bitcoin on the exchange (Coinbase uses the GDAX exchange). It then sends the USD proceeds to your bank account. Simple.

There are many exchanges. I picked Coinbase as an example because they're probably the easiest to use. They do charge a percentage on buys and sells.

"**Confirmation bias**

Confirmation bias, also called confirmatory bias or myside bias, is the tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms one's preexisting beliefs or hypotheses. It is a type of cognitive bias and a systematic error of inductive reasoning. People display this bias when they gather or remember information selectively, or when they interpret it in a biased way. The effect is stronger for emotionally charged issues and for deeply entrenched beliefs.

If she sold say, 100k usd worth a month over several years the price would likely sustain this.

"If it isn't easy, you're probably over-invested.

The old statement about ""don't put in more than you're willing to lose"" exists for a reason.  If I were to suddenly lose access to all my BTC, or if BTC somehow dropped to zero with no chance of recovery (fatal flaw discovered in system, etc), I'd be disappointed of course, but it wouldn't negatively affect the quality of my life or that of my family.

To put that in context, I say that as someone that holds somewhat over 1 one-millionth of all the bitcoins that will ever exist (i.e. I'm in the ""21 BTC club"").  It might make me extraordinarily wealthy one day, and it also might not.  The only thing that's guaranteed is that if I were to sell them (even with the idea of maybe buying back in later at a lower price), then I'd be risking losing that chance.

Therefore holding is extremely easy no matter what the price does.  Either it goes up, and I'm happy seeing myself get closer to complete financial independence; or it goes down and financial independence looks a bit further away again.

Bitcoin growth is not linear, it's exponential.


Everybody parroting: ""The bitcoin bubble is about to pop"" since 2009, don't know that bitcoin is a decentralized system with mathematically fixed, deflatioary and limited supply currency and its growth is [exponential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_growth). 
 

  So is not farfetched to say that it will be at 100,000 by 2020,  since it came from less than $1 to $7,000 in less than 10 years, and it hasn't even hit the bottom part of the exponential ['S-Curve' of adoption]
 (https://imgur.com/a/3UA7s#uX6xPGM).
 Check out this great 2017 MIT study: [""The Cryptocurrency Market Is Growing Exponentially""](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/607947/the-cryptocurrency-market-is-growing-exponentially/). Patience [pays](https://i.redd.it/d5dgq77xdolz.jpg), don't listen to the [""Expert Analysts on MSM""](https://i.redd.it/tklsw2fouqlz.jpg).


Bitcoin’s value derives from its current real uses (mainly for money transfers and remittances) its limited supply and scarcity (store of value) and its many potential uses. Also, behind the curtains there is a huge growth in the bitcoin ecosystem development that a regular folk can't see because it's ignored by the media.
If you buy for day trading you may lose money, but if you hold long term, it has been proven you get nice ROI. And bitcoin has barely started, think of the Internet/email in the 90's. A decentralized technology that has a valuable use it's not going to disappear, even if a few tyrannical governments try to ""ban"" it.




> The future economy will be totally digital and decentralized. Bitcoin is a worldwide-distributed decentralized peer-to-peer censorship-resistant trustless and permissionless deflationary system/currency (see Blockchain technology) backed by mathematics, open source code, cryptography and the most powerful and secure decentralized computational network on the planet, orders of magnitude more powerful than google and government combined. There is a limit of 21 million bitcoins (divisible in smaller units). ""Backed by Government"" money is not backed by anything and is infinitely printed at will by Central Banks. Bitcoin is limited and decentralized.

"I'm not sure about that. ""Willing to lose"" is always a weird term in my opinion. Frankly, I'm not really willing to lose anything more than €50. Nor am I willing to lose €500 or €5000. Granted €50 is the same as going out for dinner with my girlfriend, so it's not like it's going to bankrupt me, but I still don't like losing it.

The thing is you have to acknowledge that you're still holding Bitcoin. If the price dips you haven't ""lost"" that money (fiat), just as you haven't ""made"" it if the Bitcoin price goes up but you don't sell.

I'm not willing to *lose* €50 for no good reason, but I am okay to *spend* €50 to go out to a restaurant on a Tuesday for no good reason.
