"What if the spike in Mastercard use breaks their network?  Then the media will talk about It nonstop showing huge lines of people in front of ATMs, which will only prompt more people to the nearest ATM, and the panic will start.

Things happen fast when EVERYBODY is rushing in the same direction and the media feeds gasoline to the fire in a nonstop vicious circle.

A few month ago in Brazil the [truck drivers went on a strike ](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/05/brazil-truckers-roads-president-temer-economy)  Just a regular strike.  But over there 99% of the economy depends on them, including the gas for pump on Gas stations.

First there were the huge lines on gas stations, that lasted for 24 hours, until their tanks were emptied.  Then people realised food, water, medicine, NOTHING was being delivered.  There was a rush for that too, but nothing insane.

And then the Gas in peoples autos and public transport tanks finished.  Schools were closed and semi-holidays (optional days) were decreed.

in about 5 days the country (the worlds 8th or 9th biggest economy, if I'm not mistaken) stopped functioning.

In Alaska they say that It's not the winter that gets you, It's being badly prepared for the winter that gets you.

People sound crazy until something happens and a chain reaction starts.  By then It's too late.

I say a stash of water, gas, and mostly Bitcoin is essential.

"I think censorship resistance is one of important foundations on which Bitcoin must be built. 

I’d question how useful smart contracts are when they can possibly be reversed as we saw two years. Also I don’t see they’ll be enforced in the real world. 

Bitcoin can do smart contracts anyway. Not as sophisticated but at least with fewer points of failure. ";1;0;False;ebaley;e3t8aq3;How To Invest In Bitcoin;953ays;https://i.redd.it/cd9zqif6die11.jpg
"In a world where all money was replaced with just 21M bitcoins, the value of those bitcoins would reflect the size of the economy, which keeps growing as population keeps growing, increasing both production and demand. The closer Bitcoin gets to that, the less volatility and the more stable growth it will experience. I think censorship resistance is just a tiny part of that value.

And ETH... that's an interesting case. Its smart contacts are already much more useful than Bitcoin, but it's being managed in such a shady way that I still can't figure out whether it will crash and burn spectacularly, or have a very real chance of overshadowing BTC.
