"Whatever you do (or don't do), start out with small amounts of Bitcoin/US Dollars, in case you make a mistake.  Better to learn the same lesson for $5 than $5000, for example.  

You will want a **wallet**, so that you (and you alone) control the **Private Keys** (typically via a 24 word **Seed Phrase**).  A **wallet** is software that you download and run on your own computer.  Some people run their wallet on their phone, but that's not the safest place for significant, long-term investments.

You will want to create an account at an **exchange**, through their web site.  You will need to give them your banking information, pictures of your ID, etc.  They typically limit you to small transactions at first, then increase your limits as you go.  Some people don't want to give their information to some creepy exchange (I don't blame them), so you can ask here in this sub-reddit for more information about that.  **Note**: the exchange is going to tattle on you to the government and tell them how much Bitcoin you bought/sold, the prices, where you sent it to/from and you'll need that information for your income taxes, depending upon where you live.  

So, you'll get all signed up at an exchange (takes more than a few days), then you'll buy your first Bitcoin (Welcome to Bitcoin!), then wait a while (depending on your exchange), then you'll be able to **send** your Bitcoin from the exchange to your own wallet.  Why bother?  Because... this is too long already.  Bad things can happen to your Bitcoin if you don't move it from the exchange.  

**Finally**, be sure to **make backup copies of your Seed Phrase and/or Private Key(s).**  Minimum two hand-written copies (ink on good paper), **stored in separate locations** in case of fire, flood, a Boeing jet falling from the sky on top of you, tornado, earthquake, termites, nuclear accident, etc.  It should be easy to find places to cleverly hide your written seed phrase papers.  Remember: if anybody gets your seed phrase (or Private Key) they can (and probably will) steal all of your Bitcoin and you'll have no way to get it back.  

Again, welcome to Bitcoin.  Freedom feels pretty good.";3;0;False;Mark_Bear;fgk42v9;How do I buy and sell Bitcoin? Is the process instant?;eyyjle;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/eyyjle/how_do_i_buy_and_sell_bitcoin_is_the_process/
"There's only enough Bitcoins for every millionaire to have about a half a BTC.

&#x200B;

We'll have to change our vocabularies as fiat money dies and Bitcoin survives.  

Pretty soon, having $1 million won't be a big deal, being a millionaire will have lost its meaning.  A million bucks might buy a car, and then, after a while, it might buy a tank of gasoline for that car.  We will be saying Billionaire, then Trillionaire, then a short while later only being a Quadrillionaire will impress people...  Eventually, we'll have to start using exponential notation, that is, say the number of digits a person's wealth has...  soon after that, you'll need to be ""49er"" to be able to buy bread and gasoline: $1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 or 1 times ten to the 49th power.  By then, even a Keynesian ""economist"" will have to admit, ""Um, 'printing' money doesn't seem to work after all.""

At that time, owning even a small amount of Bitcoin is going to enable you to live better than most people - especially those who chose to believe the FUD and BS about Bitcoin, or who thought they were smarter than everybody else and bought into some shitcoin... those who believed in the goodness of big government...";3;2;False;Mark_Bear;fgk0vgo;Remember 1BTC = 1BTC;eyxrwh;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/eyxrwh/remember_1btc_1btc/

"I don’t think “China wants to become the no 1 blockchain leader in the world” is good for bitcoin. It might be catastrophic actually. Hear me out:

1. The whole point of blockchain technology is to enable freedom by establishing trust. While blockchain has allowed this to occur in some ways, the technology is currently being weaponized by china, through its establishment of its state-issued crypto, against its own citizens. They have used blockchain to further centralize it’s currency, not decentralize it. 

2. China now controls greater than half of all mining power of bitcoin. The presumption is that they want to benefit from bitcoin somehow. In the context of their use of the tech so far, their envy of the USD being the worlds reserve currency, and their general communism/anti-freedom approach to governance, is it not more plausible that chinas goal is actually to corrupt bitcoin ( which you could do if you controlled more than half the nodes), destroy its value, and then be positioned as a nation to be the most powerful currency distributor in the world?

">Recently they seem to have changed their stance on couple of issues, they are dropping their bastardized version of BIP70 payments and will possibly accept Lightning Network transactions in the future (two things they were definitely against until recently).

That's smart because if they don't, they certainly will exist even shorter than the short time I gave them until they dissappeard anyway.
Some of Bitcoin's core principles are *self-sovereignty*, *decentralization* and *minimizing the need of trust* by *making 3rd parties obsolete*. [BTCPayServer](http://www.btcpayserver.org) follows exactly these principles. Any merchant implementing it has **complete control over the incoming payments**, pays **no 3rd party fees**, can immediately **offer Lightning payments out-of-the-box** and the project is **completely open source**.

>They do provide an intermediate way to get closer to using Bitcoin and participate in the Bitcoin economy for merchants. They are one of the largest company in this space and in business it's not always easy to agree completely with people you work with.

Time for 3rd party laziness is over. In the commercial as well as in the public but also private sector we'll short to midterm see a shift in attitude. Foremost into direction I mentioned above. Self-sovereignty, sense for responsibility and trust-minimization will turn into focus more and more. 3rd party services like this and others will move more and more into the background.

>I know this doesn't change their bad ""political"" choices and their centralized nature... but I'm interested in people's opinion on this, can you ever forgive?

Forgiveness is a hard thing, especially if you were hurt damn heavily. Seeing former *true bitcoiners by heart* turning into shitcoiners or trying to undermine nakamoto consens is a terrible thing, former ideals seemed to have become their own enemies. Maybe bitcoiners can forgive one day but to make that happen a lot of proofs would have to be given.

>If yes, what other changes should they enact to make it happen?

"Yeah, I promote BTCPay Server every time I can, it's truly the best solution... really the best UX for payment processing by far, and it's non-custodial. Although I do still think there is a space for intermediate solutions for merchants which can't yet appreciate or even commit to running their own node/payment platform.

Seems reasonable considering the stats they shared about their customers in the past (95% of their payments were still on Bitcoin after a like a year of supporting BCH). Seems unlikely in reality though... they've added Ripple recently (well I think it's one of their investors... which doesn't help their case at all actually).

Honestly after saying this I must agree, they most likely just care about this now because the realize that there's some money to be made and they haven't changed their mind on Bitcoin or LN despite the disaster that BCH is.

"First of all take coins off an exchange into your own wallet so they are yours - your keys, your Bitcoin.
Then basically test ""restore from seed"", hand written down and secured several (at least two) times at several locations.

I'd recommend a HW wallet.

Alternatively you could do ""cold storage"". Use Electrum on a second cheap PC that does just [cold storage](https://electrum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/coldstorage.html) for you and never touches the net. You do restore from seed there, then import the master public (!) key on a live Internet connected machine to see if you have a balance -> restore worked fine. You can check a Trezor this way as well using BIP39 restore on Electrum.

For Ledger nano-s  there is a live recovery test app.

"Please explain in detail how a cash settled market affects the price on binance?

The big problem with your theory is that btc is very different from gold. Gold is a pain in the ass to transport and hold...particularly in large sums (ie. holding 100M in gold bars, for example). 

This is not the case with bitcoin. A cold storage wallet can just as easily hold $10 USD as $1B USD. 

This difference means that the main allure for cash settled markets is to act as a hedge...not as a substitute for owning the underlying asset.  Its just as easy to buy digital btc as it is to buy digital btc-cash-future instrument. 

Thus, the people hedging on cash markets were \*never interested in actually owning the btc to begin with\*....in fact they probably already own lots of physical btc and are hedging. 

TLDR. cash markets are not sucking demand from physical because the two serve different needs";2;0;False;randomee1;fgiff6y;Do you guys think bitcoin futures' trading is helping or hurting the market...?;eymbnn;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/eymbnn/do_you_guys_think_bitcoin_futures_trading_is/

&nbsp;

**The Stop Freaking Out Over Every Little FUD Edition.**

&nbsp;

The media is trying to make a big deal out of the US auction of 4000 BTC (worth ~ $37.4 million) on February 18th.  First off, most buyers are likely to hold these bitcoins rather than sell right now, considering there is a widespread expectation that the halvening (3 months away) will put intense supply pressure on the market, driving the price up.

Even in the extremely unlikely scenario that all 4000 btc gets sold on the open market, that’s just a drop in the bucket compared to the Plus controversy which allegedly had over 180,000 btc to dump. A lot of people believe that they sold a large percentage of these coins last year, holding the entire crypto market back.

So, I think it’s important to put this information into perspective.  If you zoom way out, you can see that the bitcoin chart looks extremely bullish at this point in time. So, my long term monthly DCA and HODL strategy has not changed. I hope yours won’t either based on this kind of FUD. 

It’s been a long, dark, bear market, but there is a bright light at the end of this tunnel. At year end,  you will look back on this moment and realize how ridiculous it was to worry about this blip or price action on the short term. Keep your eyes on the prize. 🚀🌝

"Have in mind several things:

You should NEVER type your words in any kind of digital form. Much less a website.

Well, only if you are using them to recover a wallet from the seeds.

If you get a Ledger, you should create a NEW seed (very easy), and write it down, and secure it. This seed has never been online, so you know it's not compromised. You should never type it into anything.

Then, you have your wallet. With ledger live, you get an address, and send your bitcoin there. Don't reuse addresses.

Before getting a Ledger (which is a good idea), I'd experiment a bit with software wallets like BlueWallet or any other simple wallet. That way you'll understand the concept of seeds, backups, and addresses better.

Remember, those words ARE your money. The device is just a way to use the seed easily and securely.

Use a P2P exchange, and trade in-person for cash.

Or spend bitcoin, rather than cashing out?  Doesn't change anything as far as taxes go (as spending is a taxable event, just as is selling), but it doesn't go through your bank.

Yea I know about that but you must be able to build up a reputation where the funds are automatically deposited in your account after so many successful sales right?  Like, when I first started selling things on eBay I had to wait 3 days after the customer  receives the product in the mail they bought through PayPal before I ever saw the money.  Even if USPS decides to take there sweet time, like when a 2 day priority package is stuck at the same facility for 5 days you start to get a little worried.    Then you get negative feedback that makes things even worse.  This was extremely discouraging at first but I understood the point.  But after 25 sales and over $2000 worth of product sold or whatever I finally get the funds instantly whenever I sell.   Does escrow work like this?

"Yeah, except you can’t trust anyone who doesn’t have international reputation or you know personally (which is pretty unlikely in this case f.e.). The buyer is always the one getting fucked if no products are sent or the seller is like: ""Yeah I sent your good, but idc if you wanna refund them or not since it costs me money"". 

That’s why banks are definitely superior in this case, since they keep track about anything and you can’t get scammed if you don’t want to.

 I know, I know. Yeah, banks suck in a lot of ways, but it’s not possible/recommended to make any sort of high value purchases with btc, since most reputable companies don’t have btc as option. On no one would buy something like a 8k tv for 3k on some site that offers it for btc. It just screams like scam.

You indicated only that you want to buy a trivially small amount.

First time buyers may like the convenience of an online store that sells bitcoin and accepts debit and/or credit card. I do not know which ones sell an amount as low as $10, but some might. (e.g., [Switchere](https://switchere.com) [**NO-KYC**], [Rebiton](https://rebiton.com) [**NO-KYC**], [Bitsell X](https://bitsellx.com) [[💳](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card)] [**NO-KYC**], [CoinCorner](https://coincorner.com) [[💳](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card)] [**NO-KYC** when £900 or less], [CEX.io](https://CEX.io.com), [Coinify](https://www.coinify.com), [Paybis](https://paybis.com), [Jubiter](https://app.jubiter.com/neworder/buy), [Bittylicious](https://bittylicious.com), [BitIreland](https://bitireland.ie), [Kuna.io Money](https://money.kuna.io), [LiteBit.eu](https://www.litebit.eu/en/buy), [Conio.com](https://conio.com) App, [CryptoVoucher.io](https://cryptovoucher.io), [GetSatoshi.org](https://getsatoshi.org) ([⚡](https://lightningnetworkstores.com/wallets)), [Cash App](https://cash.app/bitcoin) and CoinMama). You can buy BTC on Cash App without ID but you won't be able to withdraw them until you are KYC verified.

There are physical locations where there are Bitcoin ATMs and other vending/voucher methods.  Most Bitcoin ATMs will let you buy just $10 worth.  In the U.S. there is:

- https://coinatmradar.com  <-- Some will require Identity verification/KYC, others just a phone number (e.g., CoinFlip ATMs, when $900 or less), or nothing at all
- https://www.coinstar.com/bitcoin (with [2,200+ locations in the U.S.](https://coinme.com/kiosks))  <-- Identity verification/KYC

- https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/dabf2m  <-- Some will require identify verification/KYC, but not all will.

Otherwise, an in-person cash trade or an online trade using a P2P trading exchange may possibly be your next best option.  There might be sellers that accept Paypal or gift cards, etc, for small amounts:

There's also this quote which BCH and BSV fanatics  will hate:

> To Sepp's question, indeed there is nobody to act as central bank or federal reserve to adjust the money supply as the population of users grows. That would have required a trusted party to determine the value, because I don't know a way for software to know the real world value of things. If there was some clever way, or if we wanted to trust someone to actively manage the money supply to peg it to something, the rules could have been programmed for that.  
>  
>**In this sense, it's more typical of a precious metal.** Instead of the supply changing to keep the value the same, the supply is predetermined and the value changes. As the number of users grows, the value per coin increases. It has the potential for a positive feedback loop; as users increase, the value goes up, which could attract more users to take advantage of the increasing value.";1;0;False;buttonstraddle;fgj16qi;"""Then strong encryption became available to the masses, and trust was no longer required.

Unfortunately he wasn’t able to go the last mile in avoiding centralization, but he will probably be owed a lot for getting so close.  The problem is that anything valuable enough will end up under the control of the people with the money and means to control it.  With BTC and BCH that means the development teams and processing power.  Undoubtedly there is a way to prevent that, but with 50% or more of processing controlled by a handful of users, the idea that a 51% ‘decision’ wont be made is a matter of trusting them not to go against their interests, so it’s a calculation based on human nature, which is not reliable in any good way.;-13;6;False;dnick;fghrcji;"""Then strong encryption became available to the masses, and trust was no longer required.

"Bitcoin's reason for existence is not cheap fees, or as a method for buying coffee.

Bitcoin's reason for existence is to provide censorship-resistant payments.

To do this, it needs to have a distributed and decentralized mining network.

This distributed and decentralized mining network occurs because of the opportunity to profit from the revenues earned from the monetary compensation dispensed for the work performed. 

If this revenue is too low, the mining network is not secure against a vulnerability ... the 51% attack.  

While the block subsidy is currently alone enough to subsidize the miner's revenues, eventually (due to halvings) that revenue must come from transaction fees.  Scarce block space create a fee market, and thus increased revenue to the miners.  At some point, it will be the transaction fees that are more significant for miners than the block award subsidy.";1;0;False;cointastical;fghl2wl;Question for everyone:;eyduek;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/eyduek/question_for_everyone/

If you suspect or know that you are a victim of identity theft or fraud, or if you unwittingly provided personal information or financial information:

There are only 1800 BTC produces each day mathematically if BTC was the boomtown it’s meant to be those would be stripped away via demand in an instant, supply can’t be stripped away constantly and you still have a low price as that’s not how it works.

"There is a small demand sure or the price would be much lower and a no demand scenario would mean a zero value, so yes there is a demand of sorts.

The problem with Bitcoins demand is that it’s far from constant periodically it’s being dumped back into the market sending prices crashing for retail investors but making big profits for others.

If that demand was a constant the supply would be out stripped and prices would constantly rise, even if dumps happened the market would soak up that slack so quickly you’d barely notice the price change down, that is not the case for BTC.

There is no doubt the halvening is a really smart part of the overall invention of BTC but people are taking it for granted as a sure fire way for prices to rise, they may well rise to higher levels in time as you’ve said but also they may not.

Most people who own Bitcoins own them for the reason they believe the price will rise higher than they paid and they will be able to cash out better off than when they bought in, some may well believe in the technology but humans are humans so they’ll be in for the riches IMO

I personally don’t know anyone with plans of buying BTC most of my friends aren’t interested they don’t get it and not one of them wants to understand it, so I think they’ll be huge amounts of the population with the same thought.

Unpopular opinion: You just compared the ROI of the most low risk, low return investment in existence (cash under a mattress) to one of the highest risk, highest reward investments, BTC. Dont get me wrong, I own BTC, i hope it moons, and i see the practical advantages crypto has over fiat.

The point is it is not high risk at all if you invest wisely, e.g., DCA @ $1 a day. According to the video you would have had $22,263 = 2.4 BTC for a total USD investment of $1858. For you to break even and recover your investment at the very least, BTC would have to crash to $774. Not a super high risk scenario given that the last time it hovered thereabouts was 4 years ago. Even in the actual worst possible case scenario, say it goes to zero, but because of investment strategy you lose only $1858. Again, not the worst possible outcome for a worst case. The beauty of BTC is that it skews high risk-high reward balance wayyyy towards the reward esp for DCA. DCA is much less rewarding and much more risky for high value stocks for example.;0;1;False;smilingbuddhauk;fgi4hsl;What it would look like if you invested $1 a day into bitcoin over the past 5 years.;eyaj3q;https://twitter.com/JamesTodaroMD/status/1223670320541900800?s=20
"I think I get the angle you're trying to play here, but you said it ""isn't high risk at all"" if you DCA. Patently false. It's largely that assertion from you that I'm challenging. And again, the OP compared the lowest risk, lowest reward investment with the highest risk, highest reward. Yes the comparison may look cool but it's not meaningful.

"FYI I own a lot more BTC than BCH. I also own ETH, ETC and several other coins. I'm just not a narrow minded tribalist like so many have become since 2017.  So many people spew the ""btrash"" & ""scam"" venom that other newcomers believe it without understanding it, then they often repeat it. BCH is simply a HF from the BTC blockchain to have higher data capacity per block and to avoid the Segwit SF of 2017. They shared the same blockchain from 2009 until Aug 1, 2017, & they have the same supply limit. BTC has far higher hashpower and far higher market value.  BTC is Bitcoin because the market has decided it. So be it.

I simply pointed out that BCH has nothing to do with the made up ""BitsCoin"" that is apparently worth a fraction of a cent in gift redemption value. You obviously know that. OP knows it.

You can also setup a multi-signature address (2-of-2) such that you can deposit to it and only once they confirm they can see value in it then it can be unlocked by both parties with the downside that if either party refuses the sum is locked forever.  You can also get creative by adding a 3rd key in a 2-of-3 multisig that is kept by a 3rd party mediator who can be called on in disputes who can then choose which party gets access to the funds without having the ability to touch it themselves.

"Watch some Monero videos, for example 'perfect privacy vs plausible deniability' on youtube for weaknesses of coinjoin (from the title you see it is very on-topic for this concept of ""full privacy""). I don't have the data that chain analysis business do so I can't personally do it. There is a tonne of data on outputs entering the coinjoin, more when the joined coins get spent, more when you consider people combining outputs and their balance before the coinjoin, timing analysis of spending habits of the known and unknown people in the join, etc etc... Huge amounts of information that can all be combined algorithmically.

Monero outputs are put in multiple rings creating more obfuscation in addition to the decoys placed in the real spender's ring. A dumb spender combining many known outputs is highly unlikely: the official wallets warn about doing so, it's not normal spending behaviour, it wouldnt remove plausible deniability and rather just makes probabilities worse, and it would require targeted attack at NSA level. Someone with that threat model wont be an idiot and will probably even be churning, so it won't be a problem most of the time.

">You would have a hard time persuading governments to hoard BTC instead of gold.

Did we persuade governments to hoard gold? Why do they take our tax money and buy all this gold in the first place? Because they want to prove that they are stronger than us, that if we try to bring them down in a revolution and if we stop accepting their printable money, they could still buy an army of mercenaries with their gold, or the leaders could flee to a different country with huge amount of gold. This is the purpose of governments hoarding gold - showing their strength against internal revolutions, and showing their ability to assist other governments against internal revolutions, for better or worse.

Unless they find a way to kill bitcoin unexpectedly in the next 2-3 years, they will surely start hoarding bitcoin. Do you have an idea how they could silently kill bitcoin? I don't.

My guess is that secret agencies have already begun hoarding, and that's the real reason why bitcoin rose in 2019 from $3.5k to $7k (the rest is the private sector: traders, hodlers and whales).";1;0;False;AvailableHorse;fgjo7r7;What's the rationale behind $50,000, $100,000 price predictions?;exqhtm;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/exqhtm/whats_the_rationale_behind_50000_100000_price/
