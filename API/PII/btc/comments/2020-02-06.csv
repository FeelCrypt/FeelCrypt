"One doesn't transfer USD or any other currency into a Bitcoin wallet. Only Bitcoin can be transferred into a Bitcoin wallet. Aside from mining (creating original coins) the only way to acquire Bitcoin is to buy it (either directly or through an intermediary such as an exchange) from an individual or an organization that already owns Bitcoin. There is never, at any time, USD in a Bitcoin wallet. The ransomers would know this and would specify the ransom amount in BTC, not in USD.

So the question is, how can your character acquire the total amount of Bitcoin--not USD!--demanded by the ransomers in the shortest timeframe?

"Besides the snark in the comments here -- another risk not addressed here is the systematic risk inherent in these lending markets.  For example -- say you lend 10BTC to BlockFi.  That is as much as you know.  What you do not know is who BlockFi lends it out to, and then who those people lend it out to.  What happens when there is a rare event or a large default?

I think it is fine to lend crypto on some of these platforms, but it is in no way ""free"" money.

"if you would rather spend that $100 on movies/fancy clothes/entertainment or things that do not grow your asset/portfolio, I think putting that into Bitcoin is a good decision.

Halving is around the corner. The cost of producing one Bitcoin now is $7000. After halving the cost of producing one Bitcoin will be $14000, given the difficulty does not decrease. If we look at the difficulty chart, we will know the difficulty only climbs over the long term.

Some may argue that Bitcoin will not necessarily moon that much because people who acquired Bitcoin earlier will sell into fiat to make a profit. Well that's true only to a certain extent, because the constant sell pressure is actually from the miners. Miners has no choice other than to sell the mined Bitcoin because they pay rent and electricity in fiat.

For many Bitcoin believers we will never sell all of our Bitcoin. May be 20%, may be 70%, but never capitulate fully into fiat. Look at fiat now. We have QE-forever. Governments printing money like nobody business. It will only dilute the value of fiat. Overtime the price of asset will go up because they gradually worth more in terms of the lesser-value fiat.

And the financial trend now is zero or negative interest. Previously when the interest rate is positive, there is incentive to store cash in bank to earn interest. Hence previously holding bitcoin or gold looks a little less attractive because they do not pay interest. The only way to profit is to wait for their appreciation in value. But now! we have negative interest rate policy. Suddenly holding bitcoin or gold looks attractive because storing cash with bank makes you pay for it.

"If you are holding your own keys (via a hardware wallet like Trezor, or a software wallet like Electrum, BRD, Coinomi, etc), then there's no institution with the capability to send your coins to the government, so escheatment is impossible.

Where escheatment could theoretically become an issue is in a custodial wallet or trading platform, like Gemini, Coinbase (not their wallet), Binance, etc. I am honestly not sure if the existing escheatment laws have been interpreted to include cryptocurrency, but if you decide you have to leave your crypto on these custodial platforms (not a great idea long-term), I'd at least make sure I log in occasionally so my account isn't deemed inactive, just in case.";1;1;False;fsh5;fgp6wlt;How does escheat work?;ezsssf;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ezsssf/how_does_escheat_work/
"If you use a custodial wallet, presumably they will comply with local laws in their jurisdiction.

If you (solely) control the keys, then you have full custody of the coins.

Now this is specific to bitcoin, which was built to be resistant to censorship, and resistant to corruption of the ledger history data.   Other ""cryptos"" don't have bitcoin's protection, which comes from its incredibly massive mining network.

For instance, ... after the ""DAO hack"", Ethereum developers produced a fork that caused a ""transfer"" of certain ETH funds.   Most of the Ethereum community adopted that fork and those funds were ""transferred"".  (Though, some did not adopt that fork, and that side lives on yet today as ETC.) 

But that's what happens if you are an ETHerhuffer, ... and doesn't happen in bitcoinland.    The only time anything remotely similar happened was in 2013 when an update to Bitcoin Core code caused discovery of certain behavior of the bitcoin client, and miners had to ""51% attack"" their own blocks to ""roll back"" the chain to using the client that existed before the update.  This caused at least one exchange with a confirmed transaction to lose that transaction (which went from confirmed with at least six confirmations to being invalid).

But it is very, very unlikely a change that implements anything that could be used for compliance with ""escheat"" laws would ever get accepted by the economic nodes running the bitcoin protocol.";1;0;False;cointastical;fgp9kbh;How does escheat work?;ezsssf;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ezsssf/how_does_escheat_work/

The escheatment laws relate to the treatment of abandoned property, so as long as your crypto is in your possession (a hardware wallet) it can not be legally seen as “abandoned” any more than a $20 bill sitting in your leather wallet for several years.  

Then there’s the practicality of it: unless it is held by a third party, there is no way it can be returned to the government, meaning there would be nobody to actually escheat the crypto. 

So, get it off an exchange and you’ll be fine (advice that is far more appropriate to guard against theft by a bad actor than to prevent an escheatment).";1;0;False;nomoredamnusernames;fgpiuk2;How does escheat work?;ezsssf;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ezsssf/how_does_escheat_work/

"You have more to read. Short answer: mining adapts. If blocks are not mined every 10 minutes (on average across 2 weeks), then the algorithm decides that from now on mining will be slightly easier.
This means that if the price drops, and some miners quit, then after two weeks it will be easier to mine again.
On the other side scarcity increases, and more people and institutions would want to have money that nobody can print in large percentages, not even their political or economical rivals.

"OK, so the the minor miners will be pushed out of business. So what? Bitcoin is not about helping poor people print money. It's about preventing governments and banks from printing infinite amount of money, confiscating people's money, preventing transactions, lending more money than they have and arbitrarily tax us.

The question is whether the big miners betray us: prevent transactions, try double-spending, etc. In my opinion, they will shoot themselves in the leg. A fork called ""Bitcoin 2"" will be created immediately (with everybody's balance untouched) which makes the old miners obsolete (for example, by changing the hash algorithm). The public will then have to decide which Bitcoin they trust more - Bitcoin 1 or Bitcoin 2.

Apps like Bittorrent are fully decentralized, but it's not node-based architecture. TOR is a little closer still, but is only a circuit of conduits, no data is stored anywhere at all. (Like Bitcoin does on it's blockchain.)

[BitMessage](http://bitmessage.org), [Zeronet](http://zeronet.org) and [OpenBazaar](http://OpenBazaar.org) are probably the closest examples since they are nodes that store and display data, and each helps relay that data around to other, equal peers in a trustless manner.";2;0;False;maxcoiner;fgp7kro;name some decentralized systems like bitcoin etc.;ezscx6;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ezscx6/name_some_decentralized_systems_like_bitcoin_etc/

This is how it works! With things such as peering and QoS, there really is no **strong** net neutrality.

However, I don't agree that crypto can be controlled by governments. It can to some extent, of course, everything can be controlled.

It's an implementation detail that doesn't matter an enormous amount. Would smaller steps be less shocking on the market? Probably, but from a protocol perspective it's not a big deal either way.

There would be no hype cycle. No media reports gushing over the parabolic advance in price. It is purely a marketing tool built directly into the protocol. Satoshi would have liked to see his creation succeed or fail within his life-time. Without the halvening to bring new interest every 4 years adoption would take at-least twice as long, if at all.
