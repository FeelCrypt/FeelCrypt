"1. Github? Thats where you can keep track.
2. You still need some kind of whitelist that the other miners can check. Otherwise miners could just put random addresses in there, or their own.
3. Same as 2. If we just let each miner distribute non-predefined addresses at will, and they transfer parts of their block reward to those self proclaimed addresses in their previously propagated block, they could still donate to themselves and get away with that. Edit: Also, you cannot send funds to a hard coded address afterwards. Either the block contains the tx to the address or it doesn't. Other miners could only orphan the block if they are not satisfied with the address the donation was sent to.

Miners need to vote somehow to support or reject a predefined list of addresses I think.

"I hope the motivation is clear, but I'm here in case anyone has questions.

My wish is that client projects can drop the notion that it is ""political suicide"" to ask their users who benefit directly to contribute (voluntarily) to the further development and maintenance of the software.

I welcome the enthusiasm of the big pools to contribute to development, but hope that they can at least consider alternatives which do not require centralized entities or new intermediaries.

---

An answer sometimes I've seen put to developers in some of the recent threads here, of ""why don't you just become a miner"" is a cop-out that isn't going to get us further.

Miners have their role, developers have theirs. There needs to be a mutually beneficial relationship, and it can take _various_ forms.

This BUIP just proposes a mechanism for one of those forms, one which I happen to think CAN attract substantial funding to the existing projects and other ones, especially if the projects receiving the funding display some transparency with how funds are used and can show results obtained. This might quickly inspire more confidence from miners who otherwise would be on the sidelines.

I see this very much as a ""someone needs to take the lead"" situation in terms of the client projects.";10;0;False;ftrader;ffj691a;BUIP to allow ++voluntary++ miner payouts from blocks to additional addresses;etxna9;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/etxna9/buip_to_allow_voluntary_miner_payouts_from_blocks/

That's the thing. I'm super newb and am learning from others. I've found out if I'm to learn anything from crypto subs, it's that you should talk shit about other coins. I am still hopeful for people like you, which is why I'm still subbed to them. I think that as crypto becomes more of a requirement for living--which we'll likely see due to countries with failing economies--more reasonable-minded people will join the conversation. I don't think that this community can get the newb properly informed. Informing me about crypto gives them less of a knowledge advantage, which is economically disadvantageous to them. I just don't see people adopting crypto other than reluctantly, out of their own curiosity, or survival. That's my super-newb take watching the subs for a month or so.

"The proposal implies that a tax is required to maintain the system. The problem however is that it also argues the recipient of that tax be a single corporation to be established in Hong Kong. Their premise is that through an on-chain centralization mechanism that they can advance development because they argue that funding is lacking.

As they are openly critical of miners who do not contribute to development, their solution is to force compliance. They view this as a ""tragedy of the commons"" situation, but that's part of the conceit, because they are asserting that their values overrule the values of other miners who are already contributing to the functionality of the system, getting a reward for the work they put in. They are not obliged to anybody else. You do not increase miner participation by taking their profits through a restructuring. You instead push them away and that leads to a further consolidation and monopolization by those who support, or are party to, or are beneficiaries of the corporation receiving the money.

Their proposal implies the market is not sufficient when it comes to incentivizing development and to partially remove it from the equation by arbitrarily giving ""free"" money to this group all on the basis of a claim that they intend to ""develop"", however they see fit to use that money.

It doesn't matter what they claim they want to do, because the fact that they want this model is enough of a red flag to oppose it. It speaks of entitlement and laziness to either organize or develop solutions.

The incentive to patch security issues either already exists or it doesn't. They may in fact need to work harder, or collaborate with other developers and organizations to do more meaningful work if that is genuinely their goal.

What they're doing instead is throwing their hands up and pretending nobody cares more than them about development just because they have different time/value preferences about how much funding is going into development.";6;1;False;PeppermintPig;ffiotjq;"""My intuition is that not only will this cartel initiative go as planned, but that it will result in solid price gains for BCH and go down as one of the most important innovations in Bitcoin.

"Miners invest on hardware to secure the network in exchange for reward. After investing they are economically incentivized to act honest and for the benefit of the network as a whole.

Developers work on the code and necessary infrastructure. By Bitcoin's design, **developers are not funded through ICO, premine or inflation.** No Bitcoins are automatically assigned to them.

If development needed to be funded through inflation, it should have been part of the original design like some other coins. It should be predictable and reasonable. ""Let's try 12.5% for 6 months. If price crash to $100 and we don't make enough let's try 9.5% for another 4 months"" won't do.

Miners will be assuming a bigger role by voting and enforcing a change in the incentive structure to give part of inflation to developers that was never part of Bitcoin's protocol.

">As they are openly critical of miners who do not contribute to development, their solution is to force compliance. They view this as a ""tragedy of the commons"" situation, but that's part of the conceit, because they are asserting that their values overrule the values of other miners who are already contributing to the functionality of the system, getting a reward for the work they put in. They are not obliged to anybody else. You do not increase miner participation by taking their profits through a restructuring. You instead push them away and that leads to a further consolidation and monopolization by those who support, or are party to, or are beneficiaries of the corporation receiving the money.

"Obfuscating the transaction lineage is always prone to issues (segwit3x) when it contradicts the nature and purpose of the ledger. Trying to take things off-chain (lightning) because there's resistance to address on-chain issues is not just a problem, but a problem that was intentionally engineered for the benefit of special interests. High fees are the result of miners constraining themsevles in the face of controls to development which have not addressed usability and pressures sufficiently.

The maliciousness of miners is an interesting point. For sure there is miner competition, or miners wanting to be well placed strategically without it being malicious. I think when a group of miners propose that they create a fork where they give themselves money, money earned by others, without putting in any efforts to earn it, that truly is malicious. It's the start of a vicious cycle.

For miners who want to fund development, they either need to allocate more or to raise their processing fee minimums. I'm a very strong proponent of a robust system capable of handling some no-fee transactions, but if the miners are hoping to develop in a way that favors their operations then they already have the incentive to do that by putting the money into development.

"The problem with centralization of protocol changes is that eventually it will remove the peer-to-peer nature of Bitcoin Cash. This may take time, but it will happen because there are those who want to destroy it. Legal entities that ""protect"" can also be captured by governments or forced to adhere to laws of their will. That's one big problem with this well intentioned plan.

Further, one miner already mentioned that ""a list of addresses could be updated every 6 months"". Time changes intentions. If this is implemented, it WILL be extended. We can't be naive about this.

In terms of a do-not-cross principle, for me, that would be forcing miners to do something with N% of their mined coins and hard-coding developer addresses. Entities fail and these addresses should not be added at the consensus level.

The intentions of this are short-term. Miners want to fund developers, but don't want other miners getting ahead of them. This isn't a good enough reason to change the protocol.

Technically 51% of miners can force a change like this, but technically they should be afraid that early adopters will abandon Bitcoin Cash if they make without the vast majority of the community.

Consequently, the fee gets spread across everyone doing ASIC POW mining, regardless of chain. 

Since BCH is \~3% of the hashrate, and the block reward is 12.5% of that it's .03 times .125, gets you about .003 of the total revenue from mining gets diverted to BCH developers.

In my opinion, any threads or discussions about how to enact the proposal in the best way which ignore discussion of alternatives to the proposal itself should be considered red herring arguments and the people who make those arguments should be looked on with suspicion.

I have seen this kinda thing before.  Drop the proposal, then seek to focus attention about which way the proposal should be enacted.  While you do this, you can simultaneously identify the accounts of the people who argue against the proposal in the first place, and target their accounts with botnets and downvotes.  

This allows many people to believe they are actually engaged in discussion, but really the discussion is a setup and those people have fallen into a red herring argument.  

It costs a lot less to pull this off than it does to operate a campaign to gain real consensus around the core idea because once you frame the argument, the participants make the arguments for you.

Difficulty will adjust very quickly, which should make profitability the same it was before. This is only possible, because there are multiple SHA-256 coins. **If there was only one SHA256 coin, your argument would hold**.

The small miner will just keep switching between different less and more profitable blockchains to earn the most. No harm done.

Yes, security we don't really need, because our 100% security is only 3% of total SHA256 hashrate. So we're effectively decreasing our security from 3% to 2.62%.

Lets not forget that you are here today in BCH sub not because of Nakamoto consensus, but because you didn't agree with the rule set. Whats happening here is  the mining cartel are now going to abuse the Nakamoto consensus to openly rollback any blocks they feel don't meet what they expect.

What's to prevent a miner to register their own ""BCH developer"" and just send the money to themselves? And so, what's really different from this proposal than just having miners donate what they want, without any protocol change whatsoever?

"Disclaimer: this is intended to be a rough proof of concept

In  [https://github.com/Bitcoin-ABC/bitcoin-abc/blob/master/src/consensus/tx\_verify.cpp](https://github.com/Bitcoin-ABC/bitcoin-abc/blob/master/src/consensus/tx_verify.cpp) you'd add a new rule called `ensureThatOneEightOfCoinbaseGoesToWhitelistAddresses()` (yeah, I have java background, no bully plz), that goes in the `checkCoinbase()` function at line 233. If the block mined is within blockheight from May to November 2020, do this additional check. It could go something along the lines of:

    bool ensureThatOneEightOfCoinbaseGoesToWhitelistAddresses(transaction) {
      Amount totalDonatedToWhitelistAddresses = 0;
      for (outputs in transaction) {
        if (output.address in whitelist) {
          totalDonatedToWhitelistAddresses += output.amount;
        }
      }
      return totalDonatedToWhitelistAddresses >= 12,5% of transaction.totalAmount;
    }

I now realize that not everyone here is technical, and pseudocode could do more to confuse than explicate, so I'll translate it to plain English: 

* When a new block is recieved
* During the validation phase
* While checking the coinbase transaction
* do this one additional check:
  - For every output in the coinbase transaction
  - sum the amounts of the outputs that pay to addresses that are in the whitelist
  - you'll come up with totalDonatedToWhitelistAddresses 
  - check that totalDonatedToWhitelistAddresses is equal to (or bigger than) the total amount of the coinbase transaction

>The collaborating pools are the only ones orphaning blocks from non  participants while the rest of the network accepts all generated valid  blocks. This will lead to a blockchain consisting of blocks mined by the  4 pools, and a blockchain consisting of blocks by the entire network.  The 4 pools will basically just mine upon themselves, while the rest of  the network will include those blocks from the 4 pools that dont contain  tx that have already included in their own blocks. Consequently they  also have to orphan blocks from the 4 pools.

"Miner intention voting like that has never worked out well in the past. Look at what happened with segwit 2x. That was a binary decision in which miners majorly supported it, but they didn't choose to act on it later.

A list is something more complex... The only think I can think of is if there exists a public list somewhere (maybe on multiple sites so that it's not centralised) on which anyone can contribute to about their development endeavours which relate to BCH. These lists will allow miners to asses the validity of the claim of being a dev (proof of identity by linking to twitter or reddit also needs to be included). Then miners put their own list of who they see as possible deserving candidates of a dev reward in the block that they mine. 

Now, the protocol can be changed so that 12.5% (or whatever people end up agreeing on) has to be donated to any dev reward address that appears in at least, say 7 of the last 10, blocks mined (these numbers can be debated). The list could be capped to something like max 100 unique addresses initially to avoid bloating the chain with scope for upping that later. If there are no addresses that appear in at least 7 of the last 10 blocks mined, then the block is only accepted if the BCH is sent to a designated hardcoded burn address. This should prevent miners from paying themselves. It will also allow miners to contribute to who they like as long as that person is in the 7 of 10 list for the block they are mining.

If the miners cannot agree on worthy devs that last 7 of the last 10 blocks, then the supply curve for BCH is slightly reduced and the eventual number of coins will be less (as many will be burnt).

You could require them to mine with a difficulty handicap equivalent to what they'd otherwise be required to send. If the amount they should send is 12.5% of the coinbase, the difficulty for the block to be valid is increased by 12.5% when not sending money to a whitelisted address, and so their profit in the long run is diminished by 12.5%.;5;2;False;michelfo;ffhuuzr;I am a BCH miners and I propose a white list of predefined dev funding addresses that will be updated every 6 months;etpkad;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/etpkad/i_am_a_bch_miners_and_i_propose_a_white_list_of/

"Thanks, there is really a lot to figure out here before we can simply start donating.

> How would I for example be included in the list? 

Applications can be made and handled like proposals for changes of the protocol? Either there will be one list that every dev team writes into their client, or maybe every dev team contributes their own list. And depending on who I want to contribute to, I chose the corresponding node client to mine with.

&#x200B;

> What's to prevent a miner to register their own ""BCH developer"" and just send the money to themselves? 

Lol, yeah, ahm... I am sure there is someone who is smarter than me to figure out those details. But since the whitelist must be included in a node client, I think the miner would also have to write a client to mine with then. And that would benefit BCH again ;)

"You make decent points, especially when it comes to the DAA gamers. 

This isn't how you solve the DAA gaming problem though. You don't soft fork a development fund to solve an issue with difficulty adjustment.

I think we're going to see an exodus of small miners to BTC because of this which is the last thing BCH needs. Additionally, the people in charge of this fund, IMO, shouldn't be trusted. That's why we're in Crypto... trustless.

"The people donating are the 5 mining pools, and they are choosing who controls the fund. They're trusting themselves with their own money, which isn't new.

It's not actually taking money from small miners involuntarily. In spite of what the original blog post said, the ""enforcers"" are going to have to mine BCH at a relative loss to enforce this. BCH difficulty will not shift downward the full 12.5% because they'll need to maintain >50% hashrate on BCH, even when it's less profitable to mine, and they'll pay proportionally more into the fund because of this.

The exact level of less-profitable required to maintain >50% hashrate will be seen, but there's no way the enforcers won't end up paying proportionally more than the miners who don't want to donate. Those miners will instead mine the more profitable chain (which will be BTC).

This is just a roundabout mechanism for those 5 pools to pay in to a fund they control and *at the same time neutralize the unknown miner(s) gaming the DAA* (this is the real point of this operation). The miner(s) gaming the DAA will end up paying 12.5% of their BCH proceeds in to the fund if they decide to keep gaming it, and they're more than welcome to do it, but they don't get a seat on the board of the fund so it is dis-incentivized for them to game it.";2;1;False;melllllll;ffixixr;The BCH community in Thailand is amazing!;etpagm;https://www.instagram.com/p/B7vDBdYAam5/?igshid=1ktoaiz27i4bz

Yes, \_at first\_ ""cops don't come to our house"", yes you're ""charged with late fees"", then ""The state threatens to dissolve our company"" and you are ""economically punished"". Why stop here though?

You will be convicted and sentenced to 12 years of confinement and ordered to pay a multi-million dollar fine. Oh, are you 78 years old? Tough. You have skin cancer?

"If they had the power, they might. I believe developers write the code. Not miners.

It appears to me this controversy about funding BCH developers is being used in an attempt to divide the Bitcoin (BCH) community again. The trolls and anti-BCH side are pretending they represent the majority of the community and they are posting the most comments. This is how small blockers were able to fool the real Bitcoin community into thinking the small blockers were the majority of our community. Many still think the small-block position had a majority of community support back then (and now, lol). BSV tried it also but failed because we can now see this attack vector better due to past experiences. Don't fall for it. The real community sees that miners supporting BCH development is a great thing.

2. Dash encourages rent seeking by taking 45% to Proof of Stake masternodes with parked 1000 coins. And then a further 10% for ""decentralized governance budget"". That leaves miners with only 45% of the total coinbase! This means that half the coinbase is rent-seeking!

3. Because the governance of DASH was instituted from the beginning and not created by the largest stakeholders in the system (miners) there exists corruption and rent-seekers from the get go. This explains why Oscar Salas moved to BCH from DASH... Their governance system was broken from the outset.

4. Miners want to ensure long-term profitability. The miners are gambling that this proposal will generate long-term growth. I think most people will stay for peer to peer cash as that vision hasn't changed. If they enact further changes like increasing coin limit then I'll be right there with you and dump my coins. However, that is part-in parcel with the coming Bitcoin governing political structure. They must make decisions relevant to the roadmap and to the users in a way that doesn't cause a complete loss of faith. And unlike with our incompetent governments you can show your displeasure by dumping your coins.

5. You can't claim that donations will suffice for scaling BCH to a global peer to peer cash. Especially when Amaury continually makes videos and posts regarding funding deficiency.

>Changing the limit would be economic suicide. People are would sell up making BCH worthless.

I think it is clear that doing such a thing would be economic suicide now.. but if BCH/BTC fail to grow fast enough, It is quite possible that increasing inflation will be necessary to save the project.

Personally I think it is unlikely that neither BCH nor BTC grows fast enough to reach sustainability on fee revenue alone.

The concept of a cap on the number of coins was just there to drive adoption. There is no real cap. It is just one line of source code (if block reward is < X, then reward = 0).

The miners obviously won't support a block reward of zero and user's don't want high transaction fees. Both miners and users will want a fixed block reward that unlimits the number of coins. It can't work any other way. When the reward gets too low, everyone will agree to fix it at some number.

My understanding is that to ensure development of BCH that there is a proposal to define, in software, a tax on the block reward. Implemented by a majority hashrate syndicate. This tax would be redistributed to developers. Numerous questions about who gets to make the decisions and why them.

I think you can do this. I also think it's a slippery slope. The reality is that the investors in BCH do not adequately compensate the current developers. Developers are expected to have their own capital invested and simply work out of vested interest.

I think people are correct. That this narrative is causing FUD. That this could start a war. That miners could choose to form their own development teams and then fund those with a majority hashrate syndicate. Not exactly keys to the coffer. More like a straw able to tap into the flow of supply.

"Well said.

I think most of the ""people"" against it are anti-BCH. It appears to me this controversy about funding BCH developers is being used in an attempt to divide the Bitcoin (BCH) community again. The trolls and anti-BCH side are pretending they represent the majority of the community and they are posting the most comments. This is how small blockers were able to fool the real Bitcoin community into thinking the small blockers were the majority of our community. Many still think the small-block position had a majority of community support back then (and now, lol). BSV tried it also but failed because we can now see this attack vector better due to past experiences. Don't fall for it. The real community sees that miners supporting BCH development is a great thing. 

That said, the approach is not perfect at all and many do have legitimate reasons to dislike it strongly.

"Hello,

I started the Double Spend Proof concept back in 2016, but then it would have been a rather large change. Then when Bitcoin Cash changed some parts of the signing algorithm it turned out that double spend proofs could be done with zero changes to the protocols. No hard or soft for required!

Then time passed as I had more important things to work on and in summer 2019 I sat down and wrote the code and tested the concepts in my full node that is part of Flowee: https://flowee.org

Shortly after BU voiced in interest in shipping the code in their client, and at their request ([contract](https://bitco.in/forum/threads/buip135-passed-use-okcoin-donation-to-fund-doublespend-proofs.24720/#post-101817)) I sat down and did the work. This is the result.

I tested the resulting client for weeks in combination with the Internet and naturally with the implementation of Flowee and did not find any issues.

More people testing this ([testing strategy](https://github.com/BitcoinUnlimited/BitcoinUnlimited/pull/2066/commits/77fcd44257800f2fa844fd0ed63d031150e8ca8f)) are certainly appreciated :)";10;1;False;ThomasZander;ffhnex0;[GitHub] Double Spend Proofs;etm97t;https://github.com/BitcoinUnlimited/BitcoinUnlimited/pull/2066

"It's unethical to stuff fake transaction fees into a system so you can then claim your competing system has lower fees.

I visit a variety of crypto boards daily, and and I regularly see Roger and his allies posting about how expensive BTC transactions are compared to BCH. You know what I've never seen him say? ""I'm using my mining pool to stuff bogus high-fee transactions into BTC to screw with their fee calculators! Haha, high five!""

Roger is using a classic Scooby Doo villain strategy: make a place see undesirable so you can more easily compete with it. The cartoon villains use a fake haunting (literally, every episode) while Roger prefers hyperbole ($50 fee to buy a $3 coffee!) and bogus high-fee transactions, among others.

"Computer scientists gave up on the idea of a decentralized payment system in the early 1990s, because they unconsciously assumed that it would be run by well-meaning volunteers (WMVs), like all the decentralzied systems they had invented (SMTP, Usenet news, etc.).  

But that approach would not work for a payment system. Such systems can be subverted by stuffing the network with enough malicious cloned ""volunteers"" to overwhelm the real ""well-meanig"" ones.  For the earlier systems, the incentive for an attack was low, and it would have been just a temporary annoyance.  For a payment system, the incentive would be very high, and the consequences fatal.

Satoshi's stroke of genius was to dispense with the WMVs, and instead entrust the running of the system to selfish greedy bastards (SGBs), who are supposed to care for nothing but the reward.  He counted on their selfishness, not their good will, to protect the system against malicious attacks.  In fact, an essential condition for his design to work is that a majority of the miners, counted by hashpower, is selfish and greedy.  (In fact,bitcoin has failed because this condition can no longer be assumed to hold.)

In his design, there were no rules of ""ethics"" for miners or users.  Miners were free to include any transactions that they wanted in their blocks:  the fees were supposed to convince them to confirm all valid user transactions, and the processing and propagation costs would stop them from bloating the blocks with spam of their own.  That would not prevent them from inserting bogus transactions with billion-dollar fees in their own blocks; but such transactions  would have caused practically no harm to other miners and users.

Those bogus high-fee transactions are harmful only to GregCoin (tday's BTC), not to Satoshi's original bitcoin: because, in  Greg's redesign of the protocol, people must use fee estimators to choose the proper fee.  Whereas, in Satoshi's original design, the tx fee needed to cover only the tiny marginal cost of validating and propagating it, not the cost of hashing. The fact that GregCoin depends on its miners being ""ethical"" is just one additional flaw of his redesign.

> I can see why you teach CS and not Ethics.

Actually, last semester I taught also Computers and Society, that includes a lecture on professional ethics.  

And one tenet ofprofessional ethics is ""do not push a flawed system onto people by lying to them and hiding the flaws.""

And another tenet is ""if you think you can improve an open source project, but you cannot convince its current head developer, you should create a clone, modify it as you wish, and then try to convince people to switch by pointing out its advantages; and not create a $30 M company and use its resources to take control of the original project, push the dissenting developer out, force miners to support your changes by threatening them with sabotage by a bunch of relay nodes that you control, leave users no choice but accept your changes, attack anyone who creates another clone of the project, and censor and ban any critics from your reddit forum.""";1;1;False;jstolfi;ffidixj;I can't wait to be able to switch all my business transactions over to BCH.;etlkhc;https://i.redd.it/fffzowjxhuc41.png

Higher priority transactions, which don't necessarily need to be confirmed in the next block, can also start with 1 sat/byte fee and then adjust it as necessary using RBF. This allows to have a confirmation within 2-3 blocks. If you are saying that waiting for 2-3 BTC blocks is too slow, then I want to remind you that BCH often takes 2-3 hours to mine just a single block. All thanks to the miners gaming the BCH difficulty adjustment algorithm.

A mining pool business can also easily include their own transactions into their own blocks ""for free"" without ever submitting them to the common mempool. We know that your bitcoin.com mining pool is able to do this because if we look at block https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/block/572883 then we can see an obviously crafted transaction right after the coinbase transaction, which paid $9225 fee to move 3 cents.

Low fees isn't what makes cryptos relevant. Decentralized systems are inherently less efficient than centralized system because of extra duplication and redundancy. A centralized system can always offer lower fees if it has to. The only reason why the current centralized fiat systems are not offering low fees is that they love their profits. And there are also centralized cryptos with low fees.

Lol.  Cash Shuffle is a clone of Coinjoin, which has been running on Bitcoin for years. And with schnorr, the only important and interesting thing it enables is signature aggregation, which BCH devs did not implement.  So in reality, BCH did the engineering equivalent of yelling ""first!"" by implementing schnorr signatures, but failing to implement the only useful benefit, signature aggregation. But don't worry. Once Bitcoin devs implement that, BCH devs will copy the code.

I love self funding mechanisms & what every good self funding mechanism needs is a decentralized voting mechanism to determine how these funds get spend.

My recommendation is that we take more time to do this properly & create a voting mechanism for the distribution of these funds.

Specifically we need some sort of ""smart contract"", implemented as a hard fork which will require a super majority of miners for initial approval.

Once approved this ""smart contract"" should distribute funds proportionally directly to addresses according to miner vote over a certain pre-determined amount of blocks.

I will only support a self funding mechanism over BCH if it is accompanied by such a voting mechanism.

The proposal as it stands now should be rejected, to force miners to give their block reward to a private company through what is effectively a 51% attack is perverse.""

As for any tax on consumer goods, at the end they are paid always by it's users.

So, when the block reward will be low, the tax will be taken by tx fees, so the miners will raise their minimum fee to make it worthy, and the users will bear the cost, as always.

Also, as all the history of the world know, now the tax starts at 10%, then they will claim that ""it's not enough"", and they will ask for 12%, and so on, and after a few years it will be more and more.

"It is not all trolls and I doubt many real humans actually said it was. Many real humans are opposed to this. Maybe 60/40 troll/human. And, ""troll"" is shorthand for: anti-Bitcoin social engineering agent.

It appears to me this controversy about funding BCH developers is being used in an attempt to divide the Bitcoin (BCH) community again. The trolls and anti-BCH side are pretending they represent the majority of the community and they are posting the most comments. This is how small blockers were able to fool the real Bitcoin community into thinking the small blockers were the majority of our community. Many still think the small-block position had a majority of community support back then (and now, lol). BSV tried it also but failed because we can now see this attack vector better due to past experiences. Don't fall for it.

"You know part of the reason why this is such a bad idea is because you could imagine the headlines: The corporation behind Bitcoin Cash has been transferred to the Hong Kong/Chinese state. The destructive impact doesn't come merely from such incidents, but the amount of effort put into the system over time leading up to a scandal or crisis of a similar nature.

There are plenty more plausible headlines as well, from skimming money from the fund/lack of transparency to a security breach where the coins are 'lost'.

That will look real good for the credibility of the protocol... that was sarcasm. These are all more likely as a result, so even if you think this is a good idea (which it isn't IMO), you have to contend with the damage to reputation that comes with this particular risk.

&#x200B;

Miners help ensure that transactions are written to the blockchain. They do work, they get a reward for that work. They're not freeloaders. Creating a cartel would give undue influence over development to the cartel by granting them money without effort or work, which can in turn be used to give more influence to the cartel. It's slippery slopes 101.

If someone thinks that the current status of the protocol is lacking in some way, then it is on them to do do something. **Adoption, funding, clarity**. You need all three and it may feel like an uphill battle to develop in each area, but you risk decimating all three areas by proposing to upend the functionality of a crypto for something other than a security correction.

And the first issue is always maintaining security. Second is ensuring that the protocol reflects the goals. If the crypto is meant to be money, then it must display good money characteristics, such as usability. When considering changes that impact usability these require long and well evaluated discussions. A few people signing a pact with vague intent looks very hostile.

They figured out that they wanted to set up a corporation and a wealth redistribution mechanism on-chain to their advantage, but left so little in the way of articulating how development gets funded that it makes it look like the developers were an afterthought.";6;0;False;PeppermintPig;ffhktti;An open, neutral, borderless cash protocol should not have a privileged account that gives a central entity the ability to extract money from the protocol.

"> it will never go away.

And if that turns out to be true which is indeed completely possible, you will have much more evidence on your side than the present situation without it.

> If the devs want to be paid, they should set up a donation system.

They had, and yet it wasn't working for BCH. 

> If they don't want to rely on donations and want to be paid via the block reward, then their should be a properly decentralized DAO, much like Dash.

I'm sympathetic to this idea, although I'm not sure Dash should be held up as a model. The basic idea however of using a mechanism *other* than a corporate entity established in a central meatspace jurisdiction is almost certainly a good one.

> What's to stop miners and/or devs from spiting the profits from this privileged account?

Because the exact same logic that allows them to make the present proposal and execute it allows a future actor acting upon some other proposal, for example not rolling back the funds collection as initially planned, blacklisting destination addresses, anything at all that is more negative than funding the actual development of the node software, to do the same thing in response. 

And more to the point, it makes sense for that party only to split *at the time* that kind of action is proposed. Let's walk through a plausible scenario;

The present plan works out just fine, six million USD in funds is collected in the six month period at the HK corp, and painlessly dispersed to finance BCH development exactly as planned, and milestone after milestone in the BCH roadmap is hit with more speed than ever before. Crisis averted, right?

Not at all from the naysayers perspective that would object to the present plan based on the mechanism of action rather than the above objective; because this has established a precedent that the supermajority of hashpower *can* impose a change enforced by hashing power and orphaning in order to do almost any arbitrary thing they like, and there is no doubt at all that states would like to use it to blacklist destination addresses, or whitelist addresses to implement KYC, and all the typical stupidity that states are prone to do. It is absolutely possible they could attempt to use this mechanism to accomplish those goals.

But at the exact moment that they do this, then the dissenting faction also has immediate justification to orphan the blocks of the hashpower that does follow these directives, thus robbing them of the power they would otherwise have. And this time they would be doing so from a position of having the software of the node already enormously improved, and with the support of everybody that agreed the proposed ends were negative, rather than the present situation of the proposed ends being positive but the means being in dispute.

If instead they choose now to split off, they reduce any future impact they have on changes executed by the same mechanism, regardless of how bad they turn out to be, they still have to deal with the problem that afflicts BCH of having inadequate funding to perform the necessary development work, and they don't even get a useful voice in the present discussion as to the specifics of the way in which the present proposal might be executed, for example is 12.5% the right number, is a HK corporation the correct way to do it, etc.

As far as I can see, the game theory works out that the correct strategic move for principled dissenters to make is to wait until a change that aims for negative ends is proposed using the mechanism, rather than a change that aims for positive ones. I'm interested to hear opposing views on that if anyone can see anything I'm missing, but if I am right I would encourage those who are angry and considering taking this opportunity to either leave entirely or initiate a fork right now to consider the effect of that vs waiting until there's more convincing cause to do so. You are not giving up anything by doing so, and you are gaining a lot and acting as a mediating influence on people who don't have your foresight and caution.

This equilibrium works for any future proposal of a negative change at all, including messing with the custody of the dev funds, pork barrelling, incompetence, etc. As long as it's easy to convince the present economic majority of the chain that a given change aims at an undesirable outcome, it doesn't make sense for the majority hashpower to even attempt to try to implement that change, they're just shooting themselves in the foot and have a negative expected return on the action concurrent with the degree to which it's clearly wrong.

If the HK corp does end up going ahead, or some other corporate body whatever the jurisdictional situation may be, I would like to nominate either /u/jonald_fyookball or someone of similar caliber to act in a supervisory capacity in such a venture to ensure as much as possible that the things many are insightful to be concerned about don't come to pass.";-2;2;False;etherael;ffhmbx3;An open, neutral, borderless cash protocol should not have a privileged account that gives a central entity the ability to extract money from the protocol.

"The block rewards are limited and will end, so, even if the miners wanted to keep donating funds to development, there would be an end. If you don't like the miners having the power to decide who their donations go to, too bad. It is their donation to distribute as they wish. 

It appears to me this controversy about funding BCH developers is being used in an attempt to divide the Bitcoin (BCH) community again. The trolls and anti-BCH side are pretending they represent the majority of the community and they are posting the most comments. This is how small blockers were able to fool the real Bitcoin community into thinking the small blockers were the majority of our community. Many still think the small-block position had a majority of community support back then (and now, lol). BSV tried it also but failed because we can now see this attack vector better due to past experiences. Don't fall for it. The real community sees that miners supporting BCH development is a great thing.

"You are right of course, but like all roads to hell it starts with the best intentions.

"TL;DR: “Even the so-called free market billionaires of our age get most of their wealth because the system is rigged to allow them to avoid competition. Real free markets achieve equilibrium of supply and demand at a price that is barely above cost, with profits converging to zero. Adam Smith, the basics of economics: the market will radically cut profits by pulling in more and more competitors if you are the least bit successful in any market, until you are working on razor thin margins. Free markets do not create billionaires, do not create massive generational wealth concentrated in a few hands, because they eradicate the opportunity to concentrate so much power because other people compete. The only way you get to that kind of Plutarchy is by monopoly, manipulation, regulation, barriers, exploitation. The beautiful thing about cryptocurrencies is that they actually create free and open markets, which means that the profit margins of people engaged in these markets should converge to zero. You should be able to make enough just to cover your costs, not to become the new wealthy elite.”

This would not work, too many moving parts. Wallets should do this, but to fund wallet development, not network. Network is responsibility of miners, and indeed miners are the ones that should sponsor network development. If indeed the coupists have 51% hash power, just fund the goddamn development out of your own proceeds, and ask others nicely to do the same. There's no need to subvert the founding principles of Bitcoin in order to raise funds. If some pool doesn't pay, be nice people, use persuasion, not force. Every time the block gets orphaned, the hash power invested into mining the block is wasted. Doing it intentionally is really form of theft, you are stealing resources someone applied to find the block. It's substantially worse harm than if some minority pool refuses to pay, or if it decides to sponsor some alternative project instead. In USA most people tip the waiters, even when they don't have to. Some people refuse, and it's ok. This is the right model.

>This problem is not specific to software. For instance, the US government is paying people right now to prepare uranium for nuclear weapon. It doesn't need that uranium, as the supply from old weapon that are decommissioned is in fact enough for their needs at the moment. So why would they be doing it? The answer is simple, to make sure the skills and knowledge required to do so stay alive through the people actually doing it. When/If the times come where they need to leverage that skill, they will be able to.

>So even if there was no work to do at all (and you can trust me, there is a LOT to do) you'd still want to have at least 5 devs working on that codebase, even if it is only to do yak shaving.

"They don't want to let the people choose how to your their money: that would be capitalism.

They want to \*force\* a subset of users (miners) to pay a tax on their revenue and give them to a (very small) set of people that can use them as they see fit.

It seems like a lot of people are unable to see that this is a tax, and quite different from fees and block reward.

Both fees and block reward goes to who does a work (PoW), and are open to anyone doing that work.

Instead, this tax (that someone calls ""fund"" to avoid the term) goes to some entity:

\* just because it exists  
\* it does not need to do any work to get the funds  
\* it can only be them. Nobody else is allowed

"I don't think this would be much more effective than what we have now, which is a system where people can donate if they want to. Clearly, the status quo has not adequately funded development. This is the tragedy of the commons, and your proposal doesn't really solve the problem of humans (as a group) being selfish and petty, even if we wish it was otherwise.

I'd like to believe that the goodwill of people would lead to a utopia of development funding but I just don't believe it. More than that, BCH isn't supposed to run on goodwill. We pay the miners fee to process our transactions, and the miners invest resources to maintain and secure the network. 

I guess what I'm saying is that it SHOULD be the miners that fund development. That is the most appropriate and sustainable way to fund development. The reason they're doing this is because they believe that it will be in their best interests. That is a virtuous system of incentives playing out.

"My questions and concerns though are as follows:

- the corporation set up to handle disbursement is in Hong Kong. How will they handle potential conflict with local regulators or Chinese government overreach?

- corporations don’t control keys. People do. If the board of the corporation makes a decision and the actual person with access to the keys disagrees, how do they force compliance?

- the board of the corporation fires the key holder. How do they ensure continuity of access and how do they ensure funds don’t go “missing”. 

- who decides what gets funded and crucially, what criteria do they use?  If the board of the corporation gets filled with or infiltrated by ideologues of a certain type, how do you ensure development won’t be detailed away from community aims or ethos?

- has anyone assessed what happens to the miner community if profitability immediately drops 12,5% and crucially, has anyone done any analysis around timings with another halvening taking place?

Sounds like something I would have said about SegWit. The parallels are stunningly sharp. You say BCH is ""fundamentally unprincipled"" and pitch a coin whose entire history is based on undermining its own principles repeatedly to prop up a lost value proposition. Digital peer-to-peer cash? I mean digitally mediated settlement aggregation? I mean digitally secured aggregation processing? I don't even know what BTC's goal or target market is anymore. At least BCH has and pursues a stated goal, undermined as though that goal has become.

Yet through it all, you tacitly pass on every legitimate and realistic argument in your favor, instead doubling down on the scary ol' ""premine"" argument. Boogeyman words are all you have because the facts are not on your side and haven't been for many years now. You know that if you bring up a legitimate argument about the current state of affairs people will immediately draw accurate parallels to BTC's history and easily defeat you.

If you hoped to convince even one person here that BTC has a future while BCH does not, you have colossally and spectacularly failed in a fashion that I have grown to expect from a human of such low caliber. Indeed, while at one post I cry that BCH is on its deathbed, the very next here I am underlining how BTC has already paved that road; to me this isn't about sides nor success, it is about a technology defeated by politics.

Secondly, the term ""instamine"" usually refers to that short period at release where few people are prepared for mining, which was not the case with the BCH split. Since no individual gained any particular advantage from the EDA your points are mere wanking with words, which seems to be your forté.

"I'll give this a shot. If you increase the block size, the demand for three resources go up: 1) bandwidth, 2) storage, and 3) computation. This increases the cost of running a node. In Ethereum, for example, a high-end gaming PC is required to sync and run a node. More data throughput in the form of bigger blocks will make running a node costlier. This means more and more people will start to rely on others for verification of their transactions. Think of the current model when you use a Trezor hardware wallet with their web interface: you are using the web interface to query Trezor's node for information about your transactions and to broadcast your transactions. This also means you are relying (trusting) on Trezor to act honestly towards you and not show you false information. Bitcoin is about trust minimization. Running a node and using it should be available to everyone; no one should be forced to trust a third party. Bigger blocks have a 'centralising' force in the way that they make it harder to run a full node, and as a result stimulate people to put trust in others. With blocks of 50kb everyone could run and use (read: trustlessly verify their own transactions) a full node on their phone. With blocks of 100GB, only big datacenters could run and use a full node. Both are undesirable, the best balance is somewhere in between.

You assume I think I can persuade people here about this matter.  Anyone going along with this absurdity is already pretty far gone. I don't care about them.  Everyone else just needs the thinnest reminder that in Bitcoin this kind of nonsense is so far outside of the values of the participants that it doesn't even need a comprehensive debunking.

Even if this were defeated here this time, it'll just keep coming back in various forms until it happens because bcash is fundamentally unprincipled.  The fact that the proposal ever got serious traction particularly among people who've shown (via a history of frequent capricious hardforks) they control the system, is the critical piece of news and it won't be changed if this specific proposal suffers a hard earned loss.

"> BCH had no 100K instamine

Alas, you are mistaken. It was called the ""Emergency Difficulty Adjustment"" (EDA).  When it was removed with [an additional hardfork](https://www.bitcoincash.org/spec/nov-13-hardfork-spec.html) on Nov 13 2017 [BCH](https://blockchair.com/bitcoin-cash/block/504026) had mined an additional *122,425 coins* compared to [Bitcoin](https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/block/494232).  This is an instamine by any measure. Thanks for having me do the math, I'll be sure to say 122k coin instamine from now on.

Bitmain, who was paying Deadalnix before the creation of BCH, expressed the sentiment behind the instamine in their [UAHF blogpost](https://blog.bitmain.com/en/uahf-contingency-plan-uasf-bip148/) some months earlier:  ""Bitmain will mine such chain privately first"". Though the EDA resulted in an instamine without having to keep blocks private.

> preserve a segwitfree blockchain,

> And there was no insta-mine on bitcoin cash.

Alas, you are mistaken. It was called the ""Emergency Difficulty Adjustment"" (EDA).  When it was removed with [an additional hardfork](https://www.bitcoincash.org/spec/nov-13-hardfork-spec.html) on Nov 13 2017 [BCH](https://blockchair.com/bitcoin-cash/block/504026) had mined an additional *122,425 coins* compared to [Bitcoin](https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/block/494232), an increase of 62% for those early EDA gaming BCH miners.

For additional context, the whole proposed mining tax for 'development' is 3240 coins. That is less than 3% of BCH's excess seigniorage from the EDA instamining.

>  instamining is a process that allows coins to be distributed in an unfair or uneven manner. Typically, a cryptocurrency that undergoes an ""instamine"" period offers up a large portion of the total mineable quantity of coins or tokens over a short period of time just after the digital currency launch, when investor interest is likely to be at a high point. [...] a result of imperfect mining algorithms which fail to adjust the difficulty level associated with the generation of new coins in a predictable, controlled fashion.

"No, that was different.

this proposed change gives miners influence over other miners in the form of economic punishments for those without enough power.

this proposal makes it harder for smaller miners to build up capital to rival larger mining operations.

this proposal gives significant amounts of power to the core development team, thus pushing other teams aside, who might make better protocol changes, but have less funding to produce them.

this proposal doesn't have enough transparency or oversight

this proposal doesn't bother to limit itself if the market cap went up.

this proposal doesn't bother to rid itself when it is not needed.



If bitcoin had a central address that all mined bitcoin, a % of it would go to, straight into whoever controlled that wallet, the lead dev team or satoshi, then do you think people would have bought into it and supported it for the last decade?


It would have significantly hampered it.

they all developed it for free.

The recipient of the subsidy changes from a full allocation of 100% to miner who found block to a split allocation where 87.5% goes to the miner who found block and 12.5% goes to the Miners's Hong Kong Corp (although, in fairness according to Ver this might change to a smart contract, foundation or something else). And the method to qualify for a payment requires that you change your consensus rules to enforce this new split allocation.

> Assuming the proposal is followed through and is effective.... Then what is the problem?

Coersion! This is being enforced at the threat of financial loss! Miners wouldn't be deciding to fund developers, they'd be forced to at the threat of orphaning!

7. Humm. Difficulty 1. I might have to have a think about that 1. It depends. The initial talks of a block size limit increase talked about a super majority (75% I think) to make sure a fork was safe. 

Do I think a super majority should decide? In most cases yes. Do I think a super majority should increase the 21 million supply, no. Do I think a simple majority *could*do these things? Yes.

An explanation was provided.

If anything the additional explanations I can think of make me giddy with excitement to see, and live, through the reality that this proposal might portend. It also gives me great trepidation because I cannot see into the future and know that this proposal will do exactly, and ONLY, what it purports to do.

This is not a problem. When/if a pool, or individual that controls significant SHA256 hash, decides to oppose the proposal they will do so in whatever manner they choose to do so; including not announcing their opposition and simply using their SHA256 hash to oppose the proposal. That you have a preference in the manner in which anyone does anything in respect to their SHA256 hash is simply your preference, is not enforceable. You merely wish to be kept in the loop because it is human nature.

[Do you...](https://old.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/etfz2n/miners_plan_to_fund_devs_mega_thread/ffgx5oi/). If you do and you oppose this proposal why haven't you signaled that opposition through nakamoto consensus?

>> And if they oppose the change will you ask of them the same questions

> I don't understand. I**f they oppose this change will I ask them what they are going to do with the pool of money** that will not exist?

No. If a pool, or some entity that controls a significant amount of SHA256 hash, decides to oppose this proposal, how should they go about opposing? Should they announce that they oppose? If they do not announce their proposal, but oppose the proposal as the proposal becomes a reality how would you feel about that? Would you feel slighted because that pool, or entity that controls a significant amount of SHA256 hash, made a decision with their hash without informing you? Do you have a right to be informed?

* Direct their hash at a different pool of their choice

* Form their own cartel to do Nakamoto Consensus battle

But it not to ""anyone"", it is to a specific group  that control a significant portion of that, SHA256 hash, which controls the rules of the chain. It is the SHA356 miners that decide the rules, as discussed in the white paper. 

Minimizing your argument to ""anyone"" is somewhat dishonest, since you seem to be trying to insinuate that only one person is doing this, that is not true and you know it.

This is not actually true. You have a right to make a demand, you do not have a right to the expectation that your demand be honored, unless you control a significant amount of SHA256 mining hash that you can direct at the chain of your choice to enforce the rules that you believe you have a right to demand. That's Nakamoto Consensus.

I do not like that the fund will be controlled by a corporation that is incorporated in Hong Kong, partly due to my sinophobia, but also because it has not been made know what type of legal entity the company is or what the governing rules are for that company.

I'm taking the cartel at their word based on the announcement and the AMA, and Ver's followups. The proposal would change who recieved the subsidy as a consensus rule via a soft (or potentially hard per the AMA) fork. A Subsidy is always at least 4 parts:

"I'm not roger but i can explain this to you if you would like.   


Miners can flip a switch and mine any sha256 coin. Because this is possible all sha256 coins have essentially settle on a fiat-per-hash equilibrium so that no matter what coin you mine you are earning the same fiat per hash. If at any point this becomes unbalanced hash power will shift to the coin that is more profitable until this equilibrium is restored because miners will chase profits.   


This means you need to look at sha256 mining as a whole not in the scope of just BCH. This is why people have been using 0.375% to describe how much profits the miners actually lose. I can also show you how to arrive at this number. 

BCH is \~3% hashrate where as BTC is 97%. This is roughly the ratio of  the trading price between the coins as well. Currently 1 bch = 0.036 BTC  and the reverse 1 BTC = 26.2 BCH.

12.5% of the bch coinbase reward is 1.5625 bch.

if we convert the BTC coinbase to BCH you get about 327.5 BCH. (this is to put everything in the same unit for easier math)

since you view the hashpower on the algo level for reasons described above you need to add the two coinbases together to determine the total amount of fiat mined per 10 minutes. This totals about 340 BCH of value (12.5 bch coinbase + 327.5 converted btc coinbase).   


1.5625 (the tax) / 340 (the total coinbase reward of the algo per 10 minutes) =  0.0045 or 0.45%. this means ultimately the miners are only losing less than half a percent profits.   


0.45% isnt exactly the 0.375% number used earlier but thats because the % is based on coin prices and those are always changing.";14;4;False;GregGriffith;ffgto2e;Miner’s Plan to Fund Devs - Mega Thread;etfz2n;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/etfz2n/miners_plan_to_fund_devs_mega_thread/

"It seems like a lot of people are unable to see that this is a tax, and quite different from fees and block reward.

Both fees and block reward goes to who does a work (PoW), and are open to anyone doing that work.

Instead, this ""fund"" goes to some entity:

\* just because it exists

\* it does not need to do any work to get the funds

\* it can only be them. Nobody else is allowed

If you find many similarities with the state taxes it enforces on his citizens, it's not by chance: all taxes start small and limited to a number of people, and with time they grow and spread like cancer.

Another consequence is that all things being equals, miners gain less to mine BCH than BSV or even BTC, and hence BCH will have less security for the same value of the coin.";21;1;False;Koinzer;ffhq0h9;Miner’s Plan to Fund Devs - Mega Thread;etfz2n;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/etfz2n/miners_plan_to_fund_devs_mega_thread/

"A true libertarian will never impose his own preference onto other by force.  Forced donation is tax. The common tragedy argument is ridiculous since miners can internalize the developers and close-source their work or simply a willing donation and open-source the work.  Socialism always treats “necessity in my thinking is the necessity of the society” and people in caged China do statistically tend to reason this way than people in free world.  If a majority of miners are willing to support the geek development, the proposal of this forced donation will never worry about lack of donation by society freewill.  If not a majority of miners are willing to support the geek development, lack of fund in geek development is simply justice because scarce money is more helpful elsewhere.

&#x200B;

Arguably, angry miners who do not sign on socialism can easily op to a chain different than the chain adopted by happy miners and it is freewill after all.  If there are miners who cannot accept the result of hash war, a chain split is inevitable, especially when someone can summon a huge foreign hash power temporarily.

&#x200B;

Whatever outcome, be sure to follow the financial discipline that the two new chains are not BAB any more then each person’s economic interest, no matter how drastically different preference, is all kept. Let BABWFD be the ticker of the chain for blocks enforcing the forced donation and let BABNFD be the ticker of the chain for blocks dispelling the forced donation, just like coins only in bitcoin ABC chain is not BCH unless bitcoin SV chain dead and coins only recorded in bitcoin SV chain is not BCH unless bitcoin ABC chain dead, it is utterly dishonest to claim BAB the ticker by either BABWFD or BABNFD chain. BAB shall be always the ticker of coins recorded in both chains, if alive.

You do realize that to keep the 'dev fund cartel' from becoming a reality the 'anti-dev fund mining cartel' will need to have (I'm guessing) at least 2x the amount of SHA256 mining hash directed at the BCH chain to at least have a chance of defeating the 'pro dev fund cartel', right?

If that happens it will cause, mostly likely the BTC chain, to take longer, possibly significantly longer, for that chain's difficulty adjustment to happen, which would, likley keep the BCH chain more profitable to mine (I could be wrong), which would make more SHA256 mining hash to direct their mining hash to the BCH chain, resulting in a longer time frame for the BTC chain to readjust their difficulty resulting... death spiral(?), maybe?";2;1;False;ShadowOrson;ffgx5oi;Miner’s Plan to Fund Devs - Mega Thread;etfz2n;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/etfz2n/miners_plan_to_fund_devs_mega_thread/

"This will drive the price down and the hash rate down as people dump BCH.

meaning the miners will lose a whole lot more, unless they LEAVE.

The cost  is far more than you have really put forward.

Everyone is looking to lose out when the price drops, thus millions will be lost in market cap, and then you will have to choke down slipping against BSV. They may have a higher market cap and hashrate after this is over, so whats the argument for BCH over BSV then, you will legitimize BSV by forcing miners out, forcing a market dump, and a huge dump in hashrate to boot.    not only that but you will be pushing out a sizable portion of the community.

Thanks, but no thanks.


If it's ONLY a .5% then why can't you guys raise that money voluntarily.

And when the dev fund is not needed anymore/needs to be changed, what are we going to do, fork again? What are the economics of it, will the person with the majority of the hashpower control the fund and not want to get ride of it?

"Is it even ""most miners"" though? AFAIK the current coalition has about 30% of SHA256 hashrate? Yes, every SHA256 miner is entitled to mine BCH, and if current BCH miners think they somehow own the BCH network, than perhaps we should invite these other SHA256 miners to outcompete them.";2;1;False;BigBlockIfTrue;ffhtolm;Miner’s Plan to Fund Devs - Mega Thread;etfz2n;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/etfz2n/miners_plan_to_fund_devs_mega_thread/
"Like any good demagogy, there is a grain of truth here, but  the conclusion is completly wrong. The whole angle of ""all SHA256 miners will bear the cost"" is a wierd take at best - it's not that miners bear the cost of the new fund, it's BCH holders that are paying for it by getting less security for the same pay. 

Sure there will be (a little) less money for all SHA256 miners, as is the case when the price drops or on halvings for example. Some might need to turn off unprofiable miners and less hashpower will secure all SHA256 coins. 

But - it doesn't spread, only the coin that went through a halving (or got some of it's block reward confiscated) will lose hash rate, the others will get the same security.

The block reward is a payment holders make to miners in order to buy security. They pay with inflation, as the new coins inflate the supply. 

In the case of a halving, holders lose security but also pay just half: less hashrate but also less inflation. In the case of such mandatory cartel tax, they get 12% less hashrate, but still pay the same.

What's especially anoying is how the miners behind this forced tax pretend to be ""donors"" where in fact they bear almost no cost (this *does* spread as they can and do mine mostly BTC). 

The irony here, is that ""all miners bear the cost"" really means that it cost them almost nothing. If holders get less security for the same payment - it is *they* that are the donors, not the miners that simply give less hasrate to BCH.

And certainly not the miners signed on this plan, that  forcefully take a piece of the block reward, a sacred part of the protocol, with the influence it buys them as the new patron-of-the-devs, all without ""donating"" anything. 

The holders that actually sponser this, get new overlords in the form of a self appointed centrelised entity that gets paid in-protocol. What makes these few fellas worthy of the honor? The fact that they identify as BCH miners? That they can 51% attack the network? Even if some answer ""yes"" to that last question, remember, anyone with 1-2% of the total hashrate can force a softfork through a 51% attack.";5;0;False;yo2efxx;ffhws82;Miner’s Plan to Fund Devs - Mega Thread;etfz2n;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/etfz2n/miners_plan_to_fund_devs_mega_thread/

"It really is the longest valid chain. And I believe we have been right as developers/users to require consensus rules (i.e. requirements for validity) aimed at building a successful peer-to-peer electronic cash system, even if another chain with other rules was longer.

I think that is also the main issue here: the proposed soft fork does not fit within the peer-to-peer aspect of the peer-to-peer electronic cash system. Enshrining the ""donation"" address of a manually selected ""peer"" (or manually selected cartel of ""peers"") in the consensus rules is fundamentally incompatible with a peer-to-peer system.

">The way decision-making has been handled in the past may not work at a larger scale, and as a community, we need to be prepared to adapt even if the process makes us uncomfortable in the short term. Spaces like Reddit, Twitter and Telegram are valuable discussion and information distribution platforms, but they are also prone to drama and social manipulation, and they can produce an overabundance of noise that distracts from getting important work done in Bitcoin Cash. 

Exactly right. So, what’s going to be the uncomfortable adaptation?  In my opinion the first step towards efficient progress is coding a more formal decision-making mechanism. If it’s miners we recognize as the sovereign decision makers in Bitcoin, then formalize that and make it easy to poll them.  There’s no sense dancing around the issue that miners are in change if that’s what it boils down to. Formalize it, streamline it. **After doing that** you can create a miner poll to see if the majority hash rate wants to switch to block-reward-subsidized development funding.  That would be far more effective than decision-by-fork. 

Free-market governance typically boils down to two methods, **voice**, and **exit**. You want to prioritize giving miners voice; exit is the last ditch effort. This proposal so far kind of has it backwards, it encourages exit over voice (deliberately or not).";8;0;False;ISkiAtAlta;ffgl8m8;Bitcoin.com's Clarifications on the Miner Development Fund;etfy8n;https://read.cash/@Bitcoin.com/bitcoincoms-clarifications-on-the-miner-development-fund-80828a53

"Satoshi was brilliant. He saw around corners, over the horizon, but he underestimated the amount of continuos development Bitcoin needed, or thought devs would do this for ""free"" to increase the value of their coins, and thus never thought of how to fund this development. Developers can't do it well or long for free. Especially in bear markets. Paying them through a development fund gives BCH a competetive advantage. Because what other coins do this? BTC, but they do it through Blockstream, which has mal intent and is not a mining company with a vested interest in seeing BTC succeed. In fact, their business model is to hamstring BTC so they can sell sidechains. So they've co-opted BTC's devs. Yes, at the end of the day Blockstream and ""the HK Company"" become the same thing; a company who hires devs who work for them.

> If majority of the miners are already on board with the plan, what prevents them from executing it without 50% attack, and make the fund a voluntary thing?

The reason is simple, the current plan means they're not just getting the funds, they also don't pay anything. By forcing all miners to pay, they make sure BCH will simply get 12.5% less hashrate while BCH holders still pay miners the full amount. 

They turned this simple fact on it's head to somehow mean ""BTC will pay for the fund"" which is total BS.

Or create a strawman - those are fun to knock down. In the case of an actual extortion attempt there are measures that can be taken by interested parties - which is why one hasn't been attempted yet. Also I'm supposed to equate an external overt attacker with entities that have been contributing consistently to BCH since its inception? But why would I assume that? The point of contention isn't whether they can do it. The point is: Is this tax warranted, and is it a good thing for BCH? The outcome of that discussion drives the community response - by which I mean the segment of the community that can do anything about it.

">As long as the BCH-bound miners are less than 87.5% of its hashrate, that analysis holds. The ""free"" miners will switch to the other two coins, until (once the dust settles) all three coins will be equally profitable to mine.

All three coins are almost never equally profitable to mine.

Bitcoin Cash is at the moment 7.2% less profitable to mine than BTC. [https://coin.dance/#profitability](https://coin.dance/#profitability) It shows that there are more miners on BCH than it should at current price.

If the plan is implemented right now, the profitability difference will be 19.7%. Bitcoin Cash will still be very secure, but around 15% of hash power will need to move away from Bitcoin Cash.

>The miners who switched and those who stayed will see the same impact on their revenue: a drop of at most 0.44%.

This is only true in theory. The small miners who have special interest to mine Bitcoin Cash will lose money. As long as Bitcoin Cash is not the chain with most hash power, in my opinion it is best not to piss them off with a 12.5% tax (The actual cost would be between 0.44% and 12.5%, but AFAIK miners don't currently take home fat margins). Of course, the large miners can donate all they want.

Precisely. However, the 12.5% tax is not naturally determined like the market price is.

In addition to the usual price changes in the broad markets, price can react negatively to this development. If price falls below $100 for any reason, the fund will have less money than it requires and a potential extension over the initial 6 months cannot be ruled out.

On the other hand, if there is a market wide bull run, the HK corporation will end up with more money than it needs.

"Hi. I rarely disagree with you, but this time I think you're wrong about who pays for this fund. Please, let's work it out together.

BCH mining profitability goes 12% down because of the fund. This means that miners will mine BCH 12% less. BCH will be 12 less secure. I don't see how any of the money is coming from the miners. 

It's all coming from the BCH block reward, but instead of going for hash is going for devs. BCH holders are paying with inflation, as always. We used to pay only for hash, now we will pay for less hash but more development.

"Make the case exactly as you just did and propose an alternative, even potentially using the same mechanism to enforce it. If it doesn't meet the requirement of having the node software development reasonably funded it's unlikely to do well.

I think you're absolutely right to be cautious, but at the same time I question the idea that simply not addressing the problem is actually a legitimate option. We got where we are for a reason and on a long enough timeline absent necessary development the project will indeed be dead in the water. The proposal made has issues of contention with the hk corporate body at least and perhaps some other mechanisms, but fundamentally this group of miners is choosing to cooperate with each other and parties that agree to set of conditions x, as long as condition x is acceptable, I don't think that is a terrible thing. 

And if in future the same trick is pulled except with an x that is terrible, then more people will fork off from the attack attempt.

"> What can the community to do to regain decentralisation?

Nothing. BCH is the last hurrah and with this dev funding proposal being enforced with the threat of block orphanage that hurrah has been snuffed. It doesn't matter how benevolent the controllers of that fund are. It doesn't matter how pragmatic or efficient the recipients of the monies are. It doesn't matter how high quality the code, how well-secured the chain. None of that matters because **BCH IS NOT CENSORSHIP RESISTANT CASH IF THIS IS TOLERATED BY THE COMMUNITY**.

This proposal was handed down from ""on high"" by a select few individuals. It is in direct contravention to the general public opinion and is a bastardization of the original social contract upon which Bitcoin was founded. The last time I found myself in this situation, the proposal was called Segregated Witness.

"I could be wrong, but that's only if those SHA256 miners intend to direct their hash to the BCH and do not do so to such a degree that they completely inundate those miners that will attempt to do this funding. Those SHA256 miners that do point their hash at BCH will have to do so for an extended period of time, not just hours, but days, weeks, months.

Doing that would likely cause the miners that support the finding to direct more of their hash away from BTC to BCH, to take control back over.

"You dont seem to have thought about this fully, because you're wrong. Redirecting some of the coinbase award from miners toward a dev fund reduces the profitability of BCH mining, which will cause some miners to switch to BTC, which leads to more competition in BTC mining, the difficulty going up, and ultimately profitability going down on BTC mining as well in an equal amount.

"As a user, what can I do to push this proposal forward?

Nothing. Nothing at all.

In fact, there is nothing I can do to fight this proposal, either. As a user, this proposal shouldn't affect how I use cryptocurrency at all. The mining fees will be the same, it is how they are distributed by miners that changes; so *why is this even a topic at all?* If miners want to do this cut, they already have the option. Threatening to orphan miners that don't offer the cut crosses the bright line to me. That's threatening 51% attack.

Open-source devs are driven by their vested interest in the software's functionality. By changing that incentive to be *directly* tied to coin value, you change the incentive for the developers from ""functional, useful software"" to ""number go up don't matter why"". Developers incentivized by product deliver quality product. Developers incentivized by money produce minimum-required changes for maximum gain.

The last time I saw a ""proposal"" handed down from ""miners"" with ""broad support"", it was SegWit2X. Look where that got us. I am against the dev fund for the same reasons I was against SegWit: it is an unnecessary and volatile change to the protocol that renders it less useful as digital cash and threatens the fundamental economic incentive structure that makes cryptocurrency actually work.

So again - what can I do, as a user? I can stop using BCH.

- Writing obvious and known lies, with no proof and trying to present it as an absolute truth

"> They can fund development on their own.

Yes they can and they have come up with a way to fund that development while at the same time creating a incentive to those miners, that do not consistently mine the BCH chain, to not mine the BCH chain. I find it q bit elegant. Whether it works... we'll see.

> They don't need to form a cartel to force others to do it.

That is correct, they (Hash A) do not **need** to do this, they are choosing to this. And they have every right to do this. Just as any hash power (Other Hash) that disagrees with this can point their hash power at the BCH chain and orphan Hash's A's blocks. Or Other Hash can choose not to possibly waste their hash on a chain that no longer wants them to mine on it.

I might not agree with the single entity, that being a HK based legal entity, controlling the fund, but the tokens going to that fund do not belong to me. The tokens going to that fund do not belong to you, unless you are a miner that agrees to send 12.5 of you BCH block reward to that address.

(Price of BCH)/(Price of all bitcoin-forks added up), which ends up with 0.036, meaning BCH makes up 0.036 or 3.6% of the total bitcoin-price and therefor 3.6% of the hashrate mines BCH while the other 96.4% mines other stuff. So if we multiple that profitability of 3.6% by 12.5% (3.6* .125) that is a reduction of total profitability of 0.4%. 

First BCH would be 12.5% less profitable, but that just means that about 12.5% of the hashrate will leave BCH and then all coins will be equally profitable, with the whole system making 0.4% less profit, assuming the hashrate stays the same.

>So a special group is stealing from all sha-256 miners?

Kind of? It is all gametheory. If that is stealing is more of a philosophical question. 

Hashrate will leave BCH, difficulty will go down until blocktimes are 10 minutes again, but the blockreward will be less, so less rewards for BCH-miners over time because of the tax, but measured in hashrate there now also are less miners to split the lower rewards with, resulting in them making only 0.4% less, per hashrate.";1;0;False;random043;ffhmcry;This tax/fund is idiotic and unnecessary.

"> They both include the tickers.

Unless you do not have knowledge of what a ""ticker"" is and you're just looking to ""Buy Bitcoin"" (as the button suggest)... this is why I've pointed out the case of a newcomer.

Using a different name to force people into learning about an other cryptocurrency is deceiving. He could use the name everyone else uses and inform people about the existence of Bitcoin Cash before they order, that would be a much fairer way to introduce a new concept.

He's trying to get people to send him money, honesty would go a long way for not getting called a scammer.

> Maybe the lagacy addresses are used to stop people sending BCH to a segwit address?

You can send BCH to Bitcoin legacy addresses too... what's your point? That they'd have more chances being *lost* if sent to Segwit addresses? How hard is it to put a warning about not using the Segwit address to receive BCH when it is generate... is that so hard that it justify promoting usage of legacy addresses which almost always imply higher fees? 

Also the dominantly used currency by all metrics is Bitcoin, you don't hinder this usage to favor a barely used system. Unless you have a bias and want people to pay more for fees. Again, it is unfair argumentation by their design, it shows a clear bias and the only justification is promoting BCH, not helping newcomer users who are looking to ""Buy Bitcoin"" or ""Receive Bitcoin"".

> Selecting 1 sat/byte on bitcoin core is a bad idea.

"If you don't know what BTC is then you shouldn't be buying it.

That's your point of view. I don't think it is ""an other cryptocurrency.” And lets be honest. No one is being forced to do anything.

> He could use the name everyone else uses

Who is everyone else? I use the name bitcoin core. How else do you differentiate between bitcoin and its forks?

> He's trying to get people to send him money,

What a load of rubbish. I'm sure he could do that just by selling bitcoin core.

> honesty would go a long way for not getting called a scammer.

Can you explain how this ""scam"" works?

> You can send BCH to Bitcoin legacy addresses too

Agreed, but you can recover BCH sent to a bitcoin legacy address. That was my point. Have you ever tried to recover BCH sent to a segwit address?

> How hard is it to put a warning about not using the Segwit address to receive BCH when it is generate

Because a segwit address is a p2sh (pay to script hash) address (starting with a 3). P2sh addresses are valid on BCH too. But the network has no way of knowing what the script is. A segwit script is invalid on bitcoin cash. So you'd be sending to an invalid script. So how hard is it to put a warning? Your wallet will not know if you are sending to a segwit or some other script address. 

> Also the dominantly used currency by all metrics is Bitcoin, you don't hinder this usage to favor a barely used system.

No one is hindering anything.

"It was shorthand ... if BCH is going upwards, then there will be enough money sloshing around to pay developers.  Doesn't have to be the developers themselves.

However, it's not entirely facetious.

Then your work really is an investment.

To be brutally honest though: I don't see why cryptocurrency should be any different from any other open source project.  Gimp users aren't forcibly taxed for a share of whatever they make from the program's output to feed back to the developers.  Vim users don't have to hand over a share of what they earned from programs they write or documents they author.  The point of open source is that your scratch your own itch.  As it happens there's money in cryptocurrency, so suddenly there are demands that developers be recompensed directly.   If you don't want to work on BCH as an open source developer -- funded either because you're interested or because you can persuade users to donate -- don't develop.

2. and people who want to be free. 

The saying ""injustices anywhere is a threat to justices everywhere"" is true. 

be mindful of group 2. are being manipulated to enable group 1. 

if we make the mafia/government transparent and accountable we get the freedom we want if we hold them to account and make government serve as opposed to rule.";1;0;False;Adrian-X;ffhas62;About the proposed Dev fund change from the perspective of a small BCH miner;esswk0;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/esswk0/about_the_proposed_dev_fund_change_from_the/

"What people do with their patents is up to them. Nothin one can do but vote for politicians to change the law. Just imagine JP Morgan got the patent . 

Now when it comes to the protocol, there is no way patents should be allowed into the protocol. 

If a patent were incorporated into the protocol, then a company would have legal leverage one the design, and that would be bad.

"Correct, on the assumption that patents slow down innovation and adoption, why do you think MasterCard and JP Morgan are getting so many while they can.

nChain have said their patents are free to use on Bitcoin (aka the whitepapers definition of Bitcoin starting with the genesis block)

I understand the concept, but I disagree with the implementation 100%.

Just imagine if the House of Morgan  was one of the biggest banking dynasties of all time, oh that's right they are. They could probably buy all the cryptocurrency in the world right now. They don't need the money, Craig does. He's a scammer and a charlatan. using patents in a way to try to steal from other coins is indefensible.

"Yes sure. Unfortunately there is the problem of greed.

Also, if every miner is donating as a standard, no one has a disadvantage.
