> Why did the miner fund proposal not just increase the block reward then?

Bad PR.  In a way it actually makes more sense to fund the development from an increase in future inflation instead of decreasing hashrate.  $6M in inflation spread out over the next 100 years would be *absolutely invisible* -- at least at the level of fundamentals.

But the inflation schedule is like the 3rd rail of Bitcoin politics -- nobody can touch it.

Losing 12.5% of hashpower for 6 months... probably not a big deal (we lose more than that due to price swings daily).  If the market valued the investment in dev, increase in the BCH price might even offset the loss of hashpower.

Some people seem to think that it's part of the inherent social contract of Bitcoin that 100% of the block rewards must be distributed to miners and that miners cannot refuse to accept 100% of the rewards.  I'm not convinced on that.  I think the social contract is that ""any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism.""  I think that means that in theory, any aspect of the token can change, with consensus.

">Current block ~~reward~~ subsidy also devaluates all other coins. 

FTFY. I'm on a bit of a mission, as I've recently noticed a lot of people (even a few devs) mixing up these terms.

The block reward is the miner's entire ""take"" for finding a block. It's composed of fees plus new coins minted in that block. Those new coins are called the block subsidy. The new coins (the block subsidy, aka inflation) devalue other coins. The fees do not.

"Great post.

I've seen people go totally rabid over the 21 mil. Which is why I'm surprised those people would be ok with the dev fund.

21 mil is just an arbitrary number. What it stands for is a promise. And that promise would be broken if the new coins go anywhere but to the people doing the work. What they do afterwards, is up to them.

And I do agree that there might be more useful things to spend the block reward on than hashrate. Who's to say Satoshi even estimated the required block reward correctly? 

In principle, this is a classic governance problem. What to spend the common money on? And I think in Bitcoin, micro managing it, is simply not compatible with the ideals set out at first.

>In principle, this is a classic governance problem. What to spend the common money on?

This is an interesting point. The inflation is ""paid for"" by holders - they're the ones who experience the ""cost"" of the block subsidy. So in that regard it is the ""common money"" and the voice of the currency holders must reign supreme.

On the other hand, the beneficiaries of ""the common money"" are the miners. If a *sufficient* majority of these believe that some portion of their income ought to be redirected to dev, that's also a voice that deserves strong consideration.

The caveats of course are that the majority would need to be ""sufficient"" - - ie a supermajority, or better. The other caveat is that unfortunately non-BCH-aligned miners have an equal voice so it's impossible to really gauge what a ""majority of miners"" means in this context.

I think ""attack"" is in the eye of the beholder. For example, 

https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-cash-miners-undo-attackers-transactions-with-51-attack

Read the headline. It says that an attack was reversed with an attack. Doesn't that make the second attack a defense? 

It's all a question of perception. If you thought the transaction reversal mentioned in the article was a valid thing to do, then this wasn't an attack at all, it was a defense. 

>2. What do you believe the whitepaper means by ""honest"" miners?

Great fucking question. I don't have a firm answer to that. Perhaps ""an honest miner seeks to maximize his short and long term profit."" But another answer might be ""an honest miner mines according to the expectations set out in the reference client.""

">I wish I had a better answer to that.

I think both answers are consistent if we assume that maximizing your profit is the same as complying with the mission, because if you try to be evil, you risk the value of the network going down if you got away with it, so the other miners should not allow it if they are rational.

There's supposed to be a _mutually assured destruction_ property built-in that I am afraid I have unfortunately not seen manifest in reality. People are much more OK with being taken over than I would have expected.

"A single large player manipulated the price of bitcoin as it ran up to a peak of nearly $20,000 two years ago, a new study concludes.

The study reviewed the period between March 2017 and March 2018, when the price of bitcoin soared and its total market value rose to $326 billion. About half of that increase was due to the influence of a manipulation scheme, according to the study’s authors.

They said the unknown manipulator operated from a single account at Bitfinex, the largest cryptocurrency exchange at the time. The manipulator used another cryptocurrency, called tether, to boost demand for bitcoin, leading to the price surge.

It isn’t clear by how much or if the manipulator profited. Bitcoin traded at nearly $9,200 on Sunday.

The study—written by John M. Griffin, a finance professor at the University of Texas with a background in forensics, and Ohio State University finance professor Amin Shams —was accepted for publication by the influential Journal of Finance and will be published online Monday. An earlier version of the study argued tether was being used to manipulate bitcoin prices, but didn’t connect the scheme to one entity.

The paper doesn’t definitively conclude who the manipulator was. But it strongly suggests Bitfinex executives either knew of the scheme or were aiding it.

“If it’s not Bitfinex,” Mr. Griffin said in an interview, “it’s somebody they do business with very frequently.”

Bitfinex dismissed the study’s findings. Stuart Hoegner, the company’s general counsel, said it “lacks academic rigor” and offered no proof of its claims. “It is the global rise of digital currency that has driven the market’s demand for tether,” he said.

Bitfinex and the company that controls tether, called Tether Ltd., have common ownership and are run by the same executives. Both companies are being investigated for alleged fraud by the Justice Department and the New York Attorney General’s office.

Tether is similar to bitcoin, but with key differences: Bitcoin trades freely, while tether’s value is pegged to the dollar via an asset reserve. For every tether in circulation, there purportedly is $1 in the reserve. This kind of digital currency is called a stablecoin.

If the price of bitcoin was manipulated, this would undermine a key feature of the crypto market, said Mr. Shams. “The promise of a decentralized financial system was that it would be free from the influence of banks and governments,” he said. “Ironically, there are large, new entities that have gained centralized control.”

For their study, the two professors mapped the entire transaction history of bitcoin and tether, a process that involved sifting through more than 200 gigabytes of data. They then traced the movement of the two currencies.

That enabled then to show how tethers moved across various exchanges and were traded for bitcoins. Rather than showing a random pattern that would indicate broad demand, they instead found tethers flowed through tightly clustered pathways—starting with one large account at Bitfinex—indicating control by a single entity.

Tether has become primarily an asset used by crypto exchanges to facilitate trading. About 75% of all bitcoin trading is in exchange for tethers, according to data from research firm CryptoCompare.

According to Tether, it creates new units of tether whenever it gets orders from its customers. But the company has released only limited information to prove reserves exist. In April, the company revealed in a court filing that tether was only 74% backed by reserves.

If new tethers were being created in response to orders, then the price of bitcoin would reflect natural demand.

If tethers were being “printed” without backing, that could lead to artificial demand if they were used to purchase bitcoin. In some ways this is akin to central banks or governments printing money to stimulate economies, often leading to inflation.

The Griffin-Shams study set out to determine whether tethers were being printed in response to user demand. The authors laid out and tested a number of hypotheses to see if Tether’s claims of dollar backing for tethers could be proven or disproved. The study’s conclusion was tether was being printed regardless of customer orders.

**One pattern was especially illustrative: The study looked at 95 nonconsecutive hours that comprised the largest percentage of tether dispersals. This showed a consistent pattern: In the three hours before those dispersals, the price of bitcoin was falling. Immediately after the dispersal, the price began rising. Those 95 hours accounted for 59% of bitcoin’s compounded returns between March 2017 and March 2018.**

“Even a fairly small amount of capital can manipulate the price of bitcoin,” Prof. Griffin said.

To be sure, the data could have other interpretations: The authors, for instance, didn’t have access to Bitfinex’s and Tether’s bank accounts. That information would show definitively whether the companies were creating new units of tether in response to real customer demand.";1;0;False;jessquit;ffzsrbx;The study reviewed the period between March 2017 and March 2018, when the price of bitcoin soared and its total market value rose to $326 billion.

"You're thinking about ""money"", whereas you should be thinking about ""value"" of each BCH in existence. The more of these there are - the less valuable each one is.

Holders give away the ""value"" of their coins, when total supply is inflated by miners (when new coinbase is created each block). So, holders in essence pay for each block to miners because their holdings are less valuable now, due to the fact that there are more BCH now that there was previously.

Wrong. Those money are not a donation to miners. Those are money used to buy secuirty (coffee). Yes, miners are the ones that secure our chain, but they have to do the work to earn the money, it's not just donated to them. 

If they kept security the chain the same (2 coffees) but got less money, then I'd agree with you, but that's not the case. They get less money, but do less work for it (1 coffee for $5), so it evens out.

"It's more about power and control than anything else.

What is to stop ABC (in cooperation with Bitmain) from increasing it from 12.5% to 13.5%. Maybe another developer needs more money too. But now 'honest' miners in the cartel think they should get some more money as well and want to increase it to 15%. This way the honest miners get more as a reward than the 'evil' non cooperative miners. This way they can keep the 'bad' miners out. 

The trustless part of Bitcoin will disappear in no-time. Which will cause the price to crash and have a negative effect on everyone involved in BCH. Making this part of the protocol is just a bad move and sets bad precedent. No matter how good it could be for a development group on the short term. If big players in the BCH community want to make the currency better, and think that will be achieved by getting ABC more money.

"Yes, they banned me for something I said 21 days ago when I was banned for 7 days for posting something else  about cash fusion.

There is whole chain of excuses there but in the end it comes down to 

""We don't like BCH, and if you post pro BCH stuff that gets upvoted we will eventually ban you""

I have been trying to get banned for posting pro BCH stuff for a long time now and finally my quest has ended. 

The joke is on them, I post good stuff. Even the Coreons got excited about cash fusion because they can perfectly implement it themselves to make stuff like wasabi a lot better and more user friendly.

To bad for them they will not be allowed to post about it on /r/bitcoin  or /r/cryptocurrency.

Ah well, coreons  and their minions have to deal with a lot of salt. They know by now they are in the wrong. I mean Core was hoping for 100 dollars per tx and they are back to like what, 10 cents? Tells the entire market that nobody wants to pay these fees and that everybody is moving on to other chains.

BTC is doing 17 million USD per day in block reward. Even at 10 dollars per tx, which nobody is going to pay for a second time ... they can only replace that with 4 million usd per day when block reward has ran out. 

By that time BCH needs to have millions of tx per day at a couple of cents per tx and our chain will be more secure.";12;1;False;Kain_niaK;ffz45ln;I have been permanently banned from /r/cryptocurrency for posting about cash fusion with the following lame excuse for something I posted 21 days ago when I was banned for 7 days for posting something about cash fusion.

If not clear, the **coffee makers** in the story are the **miners**. **John** represents the **BCH holders**.

If you are wondering why I'm saying the miners will make fewer coffees now, it's because their reward will go down, so they will, *obviously*, mine BCH less and lower the difficulty.

- That doesn't make it acceptable or ""honest"" i.e. conformant with the mission of the coin as outlined in the whitepaper.

- The situation is especially exploitable now as mining is still quite centralized. Bitcoin needs to gain some momentum before its desirable properties take effect.

>Only 31% of the other miners need to collude to prevent their plan.

You mean 31% of other miners need to be honest, to use the language of the whitepaper.

However it is likely that the pro-devtax side has more than 30% of hashpower on its side, in order for their game theory PhDs' (/s) exploit to be worth pursuing like this.

">By convention, the first transaction in a block is a special transaction that starts a new coin owned
by the creator of the block. This adds an incentive for nodes to support the network, and provides
a way to initially distribute coins into circulation, since there is no central authority to issue them.
The steady addition of a constant of amount of new coins is analogous to gold miners expending
resources to add gold to circulation. In our case, it is CPU time and electricity that is expended.
The incentive can also be funded with transaction fees. If the output value of a transaction is
less than its input value, the difference is a transaction fee that is added to the incentive value of
the block containing the transaction. Once a predetermined number of coins have entered
circulation, the incentive can transition entirely to transaction fees and be completely inflation
free.
The incentive may help encourage nodes to stay honest. If a greedy attacker is able to
assemble more CPU power than all the honest nodes, he would have to choose between using it
to defraud people by stealing back his payments, or using it to generate new coins. He ought to
find it more profitable to play by the rules, such rules that favour him with more new coins than
everyone else combined, than to undermine the system and the validity of his own wealth.

You haven't spent the time and don't get what the proposal is. It's not miners paying whatsoever. It's users paying - through inflation. 

I'll try to explain. You see, miners are paid for doing work - using X amount of electricity to mine a block. The price of X roughly equals the block reward. By decreasing the block reward, miners decrease the electricity spent on securing BCH, so they don't mine at a loss. Ever. 

So no, miners are not paying for it. They will get less, but will do less work in exchange. The fund is paid by the minted coins that used to go for security and now are redirected to miners.

I see this as the same as the balance of decentralization and utility/adoption, and the balance of privacy and user-friendliness. Too decentralized that nobody uses it leads to failed adoption. Too technical and privacy focused turns new users away, and leads to failed adoption. It's a careful balance.

The sscary issue is if we rebuild this feature, new wallets have a chance at getting created with a password that the user has a strong chance of forgetting (ie peter schiff). 

The new wallet is focused for the masses and the next 50M users coming into the space. That means making it both secure, and user friendly, for everyone. We want to avoid at all cost adding low-usage additional risks to users funds and presenting them with a whole new backup / restoration education experience.

Though I will most probably keep using it for low level spending tipping & the odd vittles when I get the chance and recommend accordingly


on onboarding the next 50m I am not sure the difference between saving 13/25 words over 12/24 is that great especially given the extra security that it provides.


I am disappointed that this feature is now not exposed (I believe the internals of a HD wallet still require it in the salting ( isn't it internally just a fixed password/salt 'mnemonic', not sure if this is the case for Bitcoin.com wallet would be interested in the details)


I also like the fact that it allows me to effectively introduce 3rd party entropy into my wallet relatively safely (I dont' have to wholly trust the RNG of the device: ledger trezor phone etc)

a good protocol is a good protocol, and importantly it protects from a specific type of attack that is applicable to a dedicated hardware wallet or phone wallet (someone accessing your written down seed phrase)


as Lopp and others have said your funds are probably at more risk from yourself than some hacker. 


How secure is an idevice that one uses only as a crypto wallet - in real terms probably pretty close enough to a trezor for 'normal' peoples funds.

"Congratulations!

BTW, in the last Meet-up I went to I tested your wallet to pay the restaurant's bill. I found a small bug and something that's not really bug but was actually more annoying. I don't know if Reddit is a good place to report it but here it goes:

When scanning the BCH register QR code, the decimal point for the amount didn't come through, I had to add it manually. It might be locale related, in my language commas are decimal separators and dots are thousand separators.

Another thing I noticed is that the wallet wouldn't send any money before finishing sync, what took a little while. I think I understand the rationale, if the keys are being used elsewhere, you could end up producing a double spend. But honestly that would be quite rare and, most importantly, *not recommend* usage. People exporting their keys to different places should take care. Most people would rather have the better UX of just sending the money immediately after opening the app than this protection. In other words, I'd remove this restriction, and perhaps add a warning when exporting keys (or even the possibility of reactivating this restriction through an opt-in config) EDIT: also, it would be nice to sync once in a while in the background, so that it doesn't need to happen entirely when you open the app.";1;0;False;caveden;ffzga9m;For 10 months I have been maintaining the Java BCH library, bitcoincashj.

Large businesses have a use case for that security and have the capital to acquire the coins, hence BTC is better for them and they don't mind the fees.

This isn't true. it is nearly impossible to double spend on BCH, just like it is nearly impossible to double spend on BTC.

"> Isn't this different than centralization of mining? Could a group of miners ever get together and tell BTC they were going to implement a 12.5% donation or orphan blocks?

Yes, miners own the hardware that runs the bitcoin node program. In theory, the miners can implement a donation or orphan blocks but they won't because it will hurt the price too much. Their focus on the price forces them to be extremely conservative in any decision because of the small profit margin. It's part of why the miners didn't increase the blocksize even though they had the power to. I highly recommend Mike Hearn's articles about the blocksize to get a sense of what was going on.

> Decentralization means that the system is secure against attacks because power isn't concentrated into small groups. Is there mode diversity in mining nodes in BTC?

The miners need to run the bitcoin program (Bitcoin Core for BTC, Bitcoin ABC (#1), Bitcoin Unlimited (close #2), Verde, BCHD, Flowee etc for BCH) to process transactions and get rewarded for the doing so. The Core developers are the ones in control of the BTC code repository so even if it's open source and you were to submit changes to the code, they would have to approve of it first. They call the Bitcoin Core program the reference client so any other BTC node software will have to conform to Bitcoin Core rules which is why you don't see other node programs used. https://coin.dance/nodes/share";1;0;False;MoonNoon;ffzi8vt;BTC vs BCH, what will happen in the long term?;evu02t;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/evu02t/btc_vs_bch_what_will_happen_in_the_long_term/

"Sorry. A very short and glossed over history. Bitcoin usage was growing but the 1MB block limit only allowed for about 3 to 4 transactions a second. Big blockers wanted to increase to block limit so that usage was not constrained. Small blockers wanted to keep blocks small to try to keep the network decentralized. What the Bitcoin Core developers came up with was Segwit.

Segwit is short for Segregated Witness. It changed how transactions are stored in the blockchain to increase transaction capacity without increasing the blocksize limit of 1MB. Segwit2X was an agreement between the developers and miners to first implement Segwit and then a blocksize limit increase to 2MB but because of censorship, threats of forks, and fake meetings, only the Segwit part happened. Because of how drastic the Segwit changes were, Amaury Sechet created Bitcoin Cash and split the Bitcoin chain before Segwit was implemented.

"BTC is still the reserve currency of the crypto market. It's so dominant because of the first mover advantage and it's the first thing non-crypto people think of when the hear of cryptocurrency. Maybe that'll change one day. We are also still in uncertain times for the crypto market so people are more inclined to jump into BTC waiting for the bull market to pick up before jumping into anything else. The roadmap of BTC has more or less killed the idea of any further on-chain scaling. If future years bring on more users, BTC fees will go high enough that it won't be usable besides a digital vault for large amounts of wealth.BTC retains one portion of the original vision: a speculative digital gold. That part of the vision could be disrupted if BCH or another cryptocurrency in the years ahead.

BCH is exciting because it tackles the more dangerous to the status quo portion of the original vision: a money usable in commerce. Sure, cup of coffee and all that, but I'm more interest in typical online purchases and digital payments as a whole. Seeing the physical locations in Asia and Australia accepting BCH is very exciting. Payments are what makes it a true currency, else it'll just be like gold. People need to be able to use and spend it to be empowered. Else it'll just be a constant swap of on and off national currencies. The roadmap is dedicated to scaling on-chain and one I personally believe in.

The future of either is pretty speculative. This is a very long term play. Sure you might be able to make some short term price plays, but the vision and adoption is a long road. Eye on the prize. I am continuing to accumulating BCH.

"> Can the reason just be ignorance and branding? How can the markets be more irrational?

Pretty much. Over the long term markets are efficient but not the short term and most of the cryptospace is about speculation. It's anecdotal but I went to a general crypto meetup during the 2018 bull run and it was 99% of people trying to make a quick buck. That's fine but I love Bitcoin Cash because the community strongly values peer to peer cash for everyone.

A huge part in low BCH price is that it started out with negative perception because of BTC maximalist trolls calling it ""bcash"" or a scam. Even non malicious people think Roger Ver created Bitcoin Cash but the fact is he joined a while after Segwit2X failed. I believe once people see all the work being done on BCH the negative perception will turn into positive causing people to buy.

> Does BTC have more decentralization or security? 

At the moment, there is no denying that it has more security due to the higher price. BCH is more decentralized because while it shares the same miners as BTC, BCH has multiple node programs while BTC only has Bitcoin Core deciding the direction of the project. 

> Does the store of value narrative actually make sense?

To me it does not. Money must be useful and BTC isn't useful if I have to pay $5+ to send a transaction. Sure some people will say they got away with paying <$1 right now when there isn't a rush to use it but when the next bull run comes, expect to pay high fees again on BTC. High fees are what the developers want and openly celebrate it. There is no point in holding if you can't spend it later because the fees shoot up.

It doesn't hurt to diversify but I expect BCH and ETH to significantly outperform BTC.

"I think the most basic argument for why BCH is superior to BTC long term is simply that BCH has a road map to scale the protocol which seems to be working where BTC seems to have failed to scale.

BTC is ahead of BCH in marketcap, hash, and price because it had a 8 year head start and enjoys first mover advantage in crypto (network effect). BCH was also attacked from the inside leading to a major split. Honestly you should look at the fact that it is still alive at all as a sign it's worth looking into.

"BTC has centralized development and can not scale for massive worldwide adoption. This means big waves of new investors cannot be on-boarded and push the price to massive new highs in a short time-span. Maybe if they do it slowly?

Anyway, BCH is the only Bitcoin still working to be able to scale for massive worldwide adoption. It is the future of Bitcoin if there will be a massive peer-to-peer electronic cash for the world's people.

So, good question! Why would the intentionally broken and centralized BTC be worth so much? IMO, the long answer is here:

"Bitcoin Cash is the ORIGINAL Bitcoin blockchain that dates back to the original Bitcoin transactions, but it has been technically upgraded to continue allowing low fees & fast transactions & reliable transactions & secure transactions & ease of usage.

This is exactly what Satoshi wanted in the original whitepaper:
[https://www.bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf](https://www.bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf)

Here's a chart comparing the main advantages of Bitcoin Cash BCH vs. Bitcoin Core BTC: https://imgur.com/Hr4CbIi 

The important thing to note is that Bitcoin Core BTC HAD ALL OF THOSE ADVANTAGES AT THE BEGINNING, but since they decided to stop the blocksize from increasing, break the legitimacy of the chain with SegWit, remove reliability of transactions by introducing RBF (replace-by-fee), and many many many other poor changes to the protocol, they have now made their own chain slow, expensive, unreliable, insecure, complicated to use, and is no longer P2P electronic cash. 

Even if you believe them that Lightning can actually work & can scale (even though Lightning can't work and can't scale), Lightning is a SECOND LAYER that could easily be put on top of ANY cryptocurrency, and Lightning is also a custodial network so you no longer have P2P electronic cash anymore.

The ONLY reason that BTC has a higher price than BCH right now is this: 

1. Even though they changed the core fundamental nature of what Bitcoin is, they didn't give up the name Bitcoin. So they essentially stole the original brand name, even though they're not the original Bitcoin anymore. Even though their network doesn't work as intended anymore. They are a completely different project now, yet they stole the original name. This is what confuses people.

2. The r/bitcoin subreddit has been partaking in an ELABORATE CENSORSHIP & PROPAGANDA CAMPAIGN for the last 5 years. They delete & censor hundreds upon hundreds of posts per week, and they will ban any users that don't say EXACTLY what toes their party line. The only way they can win is by lying and suppressing the truth and by brainwashing. There is no freedom of speech nor open debates nor freedom of discussion in their subreddit, as well as several of the Bitcoin forums on the web. (See links to censorship articles below.)

3. How many people in the world do you know who can technically explain what Bitcoin is, how Bitcoin works, why Bitcoin is important for the world, how mining works, and what advantages Bitcoin provides over fiat currency & the existing banking system? VERY FEW PEOPLE. Maybe less than 0.1% of the entire world? Therefore, when 99.99% of the population hears about ""investing in cryptocurrency"", they have absolutely no clue what they are investing in. They just invest in ""Bitcoin"" because they've heard of it before. They have no idea whether the BTC network works properly or not. They're just throwing their money into it because it's the ""biggest brand name"" in cryptocurrency. But the only reason it got the biggest brand name was because (a) it was first to market, and (b) it used to be amazing & magical. It is no longer amazing & magical, because it has very little to do with the innovations that were outlined in the Bitcoin whitepaper. (See link to whitepaper above.) Let's face it — most people are stupid & can't do any independent thinking for themselves, so most of them have absolutely NO IDEA what they are investing in. But if/when Bitcoin becomes mainstream, people are obviously never going to use BTC, because they CAN'T use it. 

By the way, here are just a few articles on the censorship that has been going on with them for years.

Now Bitcoin's price might very well go up in the short term, but as people & companies around the world ACTUALLY START USING CRYPTOCURRENCY, everybody will quickly wake up to see that BTC is completely unusable, while BCH is perfectly usable as intended. 

Therefore, as people start seeing the utility & the value in their own lives, everyone will start using BCH and start recognizing that BCH is really the only true P2P electronic cash, because it is the only Bitcoin that actually has UTILITY. So over time, BCH's value should overtake BTC's value.

"BTC's main advantage is higher security which allows you to send $10K and be highly confident it cannot be double spent after 1 confirmation. For BCH, that number is around $300. Large businesses have a use case for that security and have the capital to acquire the coins, hence BTC is better for them and they don't mind the fees.

BCH has the disadvantage of being at the mercy of Core deciding to backpedal on their 1MB narrative. If they decide to life the caps, BCH has little advantage over BTC.

Another important factor to consider is the ecosystem. Whenever you need to switch ecosystem, you suffer exchange fees. If you use the coins that is used by most of your trading partners, you save on exchange fees. Those who choose to not participate in the higher network coin stand to lose over time due to paying exchange fees on all transactions.

BTC is limiting itself to 1MB monetary transactions only, which caps the userbase. BCH aims to create an ecosystem for all monetary transactions and arbitrary tokens. Right now, this ecosystem is much smaller, but is growing daily. Going with BCH is a bet that the rest of the world will eventually onboard the better ecosystem, but there's no reason to use BCH right now, other than lower fees. If BCH manages to surpass BTC's network effect, there will be no going back for BTC.

If things remain as they are, BCH will clearly win long term. However, it only takes 1 carefully planned move from Core to change the narrative and crush BCH before it can gain critical mass.

"> A big theme in the country now is how middle of the road politics are no  longer sufficient to make people happy. The country is being pressured  to move more extremely left or right, meaning toward more freedom and  less government or the opposite, less freedom and more government. 

The ""right"" in the USA pretends it wants more freedom and  less government while providing the opposite when they have control.

I am not a big Bernie follower, but, my understanding is the radical proposals are to remove ""middlemen"" (insurance companies, central bankers) who make everything more expensive and provide no actual benefit. They are wealthy capitalists taking advantage of the current system and caring only for themselves. Both Capitalism and Democratic Socialism are great in theory. Neither works as well as promised by proponents in the real world.

"> The ""right"" in the USA pretends it wants more freedom and less government while providing the opposite when they have control.

That's why there is the term ""neo conservative"" or ""new right"". Another term is RINO, which stands for Republican In Name Only. People like George Bush and Donald Trump are RINOs. They are not really conservative because they support big government. Trump is slightly more to the right of George Bush, which is why he got elected. To get somebody that's actually on the right requires Ron Paul or Rand Paul (both of whom I supported for president). 

>Both Capitalism and Democratic Socialism are great in theory. Neither works as well as promised by proponents in the real world.

No, Capitalism is great in theory and also in practice. This is proven. Look how many people literally lose their lives trying to get IN to the United States. Looking at the opposite example, Venezuela, where the model is Socialism over 4 million people ran out (burdening other countries) as fast as they could. The U.S. doesn't even have pure capitalism, but the version it has is just that much better.

Pure capitalism didn’t cause global warming. Corruption caused it. Capitalism monetized meritocracy. Meritocracy intrinsically forms hierarchies. Those hierarchies, over time, become laden with more of the wealth in the system. That leads to corruption from those trying to maintain their wealth in the face of a constantly shifting meritocracy.  Naturally the top heavy wealth will collapse and renewal will begin. It’s happened many times before. Unfortunately every time the system gets bigger and more becomes at stake. That’s life. 🤷‍♂️;1;1;False;Odbdb;ffyexum;Peter Shiff Explains Brilliantly Why Capitalism Works And Socialism Causes Misery - Money Facilitates Capitalism, But Bitcoin is Better Money for Same Underlying Reason: Human Nature;evq56n;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/evq56n/peter_shiff_explains_brilliantly_why_capitalism/
"> Those hierarchies, over time, become laden with more of the wealth in the system.

Your view of ""wealth"" isn't accurate. Wealth comes from people. It's not some already defined amount, like the amount of above gold on earth, which is subject to be shifted and once its gone its gone. Anybody can create wealth all by themselves as long as they have (fertile) land and the determination to make things happen.";1;0;False;cryptos4pz;ffzep7t;Peter Shiff Explains Brilliantly Why Capitalism Works And Socialism Causes Misery - Money Facilitates Capitalism, But Bitcoin is Better Money for Same Underlying Reason: Human Nature;evq56n;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/evq56n/peter_shiff_explains_brilliantly_why_capitalism/

"Two really big advantages.

1) multiplication!

We don't have multiplication yet. So any form of multiplication is useful. Currently any multiplication needs to be faked with awkwardly arranged divisions. This is worse than it sounds because of the limits of integer math where `1000000/5 = 200000` is a useful number but `5/1000000 = 0` is useless and `12/5 = 2` is very questionable.

Not only that but also...

2) big numbers

Script numbers have some historical limitations (31 bit +sign) that we will eventually fix in BCH script. But for now, we can't use big numbers in calculations. For example, if you just use satoshis, the max number you can manipulate with math operations (reliably without depending on overflow) in script is 2147483647 --> 21 BCH. If you include any other numbers in the multiplication, that gets much smaller.

"Your prize for ""getting past this"" is getting delisted everywhere, banned by all major countries, all miners forced to stop or be arrested and all plant and equipment seized, and market cap going to zero literally overnight.

Bitcoin was designed as a transparent ledger specifically to avoid this fate, having seen it befall many previous cryptocurrencies in the 90s and early 00s (which most people never heard of as the news was overshadowed by the dotcom bust). Bitcoin is the only real privacy coin. Can't-ever-find-me anonymity is, due to legal precedent, effectively the opposite of privacy. By using many of what are known as ""anonymity"" measures you effectively forfeit your legal right to privacy, giving governments free rein to perform search and seizure on you, or the civil forfeiture stories you hear.

"Redeeming or moving large amounts of money will always require evidence of where you obtained the money and that it was for good consideration and without knowledge of having been proceeds of crime. Mixing (as practiced today, i.e., without KYC info taken from every mixing partner) kills this. No matter how many subsequent hops, if an innocent person says they got a large amount of coins on Kraken but then the path to them is broken by a mixer, they have no proof and civil forfeiture becomes a possibility in many jurisdictions.

Moreover, those Kraken coins end up in various criminal cases if any of their mixing partners were not white market and were caught, making them a potential suspect. Messy and risky for their wealth. CoinJoin and its ilk are not privacy measures. They are ways for innocent people to dirty their coins and put their wealth at risk pointlessly, possibly while helping terrible people avoid prosecution (but not civil forfeiture). I hope innocent people read up on the law and speak to a lawyer who understands money law before getting caught up in what ""everyone is doing"" on the Internet.

Bitcoin in its original design, with pseudonymous traceability, is the ONLY privacy coin. Most things people think of as privacy measures actually ruin privacy by upsetting the delicate legal balance of privacy vs. investigation that has formed over millennia in society. Crimes need to be investigatable while not invading privacy. The balance is called ""due process of law."" Warrants, etc. Trying to have coins that are immune to a search warrant just opens the coins to automatic forfeiture under the law, and trying to have a whole system that does this by default just results in said system being universally banned and market cap going to zero instantly. It takes a few years as governments catch up to how old law applies to new technology, but catch up they do. 

Bitcoin has a transparent ledger for precisely this reason. It was built from the ashes of failed anoncoins, which failed because they tried to subvert the traditional due process rules that the 4th amendment refers to.

Conversely, if tainted coins are spent in small amounts at various places, those coins become clean in many jurisdictions. Naturally, or else retail stores could not operate. If 7-11 takes dollar bills from a hitman for a Slurpee, not knowingly of course, the money is thereby cleaned (as long as the bills were not on a blacklist that 7-11 is required by law to keep). There is a whole legal process by which money dirties and cleans itself. Mixing is a way of turning black money grey and white money grey. If you are innocent, criminals may try to convince you to throw money into a communal trough with them, as they get a little something out of it. This is another reason stores often refuse to make change. Good consideration, receipts...records matter. Would you trade a thousand dollars in bills obtained from your bank ATM with a drug dealer for their dollar bills? In the name of somehow boosting your privacy?? If not, why the heck are innocent people mixing their white coins with randos?

Mixing is covered in law as of centuries ago, so long ago that ""mixed"" was still spelled ""mixt."" 

Mixing while getting legally-required  KYC info from each participant could be a privacy measure, but careful records would have to be kept and Bitcoin at scale with proper privacy wallets makes it unnecessary. Real privacy is not found in mixing funds with possible criminals, but in being unable to fall prey to mass surveillance. Most people can't figure out how one can avoid mass surveillance without things like mixing. There are ways, as the industry will discover. There are legal ways to maintain privacy without thwarting court-ordered procedures. This no doubt will stick in the craw of anti-government types, but it shouldn't. Unless you are an anti-law type as well. Hint: money laws are not the result of government edict. They evolved over millennia and would exist in any society, regardless of state or non-state. Yes AML5 is an EU piece of legislation, but it merely preempts the process of going through court cases to discover how old law applies to crypto, which would take a few years. The result is roughly the same, as the legislation just tries to codify centuries of custom in the manner in which it will  foreseeably be applied to new tech eventually in courts. 

Unfortunately the evolved rules that make society work are complicated, having been discovered over thousands of years of trial and error, and unfortunately if you want to enjoy the benefits of being on the forefront of technology you have to understand these rules.

"Read up on the law of tracing and source of wealth laws. Coins from a source you know, received for good consideration, without knowledge of being proceeds of crime, with records kept, are usually considered clean in most jurisdictions. This is old, old law. Mixing without KYC on each mixing partner is auto-screwing your own money. It is not a privacy measure. 

Money Walmart obtained from a drug dealer is not tainted if they received it for good consideration and had no knowledge it was from a drug dealer or was the proceeds of crime. Otherwise obviously the economy would grind to a halt. 

For large amounts you also need KYC info from them in most countries. 

These same rules apply to crypto more or less as is; it's just a matter of courts coming to grips with how existing law applies. There are also some new policies like AML5 going into effect this month that make this more explicit on the front end (rules announced as legislation, before anything even goes to court). AML5 is probably what is triggering this recent move by exchanges, but mixing without doing KYC on every mixing partner was always a naff idea, a way of voluntarily putting your wealth at risk (turning your white coins grey) while simultaneously turning black market money grey for a criminal (not just drug dealers, but human traffickers and worse...think what anonymity means and who seeks it most, and what stops governments will pull out to combat it, having effectively absolute mandate from its citizens).";0;1;False;TwatoshiSuckafucko;ffykhvb;Are CashShuffle and CashFusion just as easy for exchanges to detect as CoinJoin?;evnf36;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/evnf36/are_cashshuffle_and_cashfusion_just_as_easy_for/

"What I ""really meant"" was exactly what I wrote in my brief article. Again, it was only four paragraphs (or really *three* since the first one was just introduction). But because I'm such a friendly guy, I'll try to explain why your attempt to ""boil down"" those three paragraphs into two sentences is mistaken or incomplete (apologies in advance if this explanation ends up being almost as long as the original article).

>I believe it boils down to 'it will lower hash rate' making the coin less valuable to holders even if the price does not fall 

Not quite. Here's how you might enumerate the key points:

1. At first glance, the proposal looks like it's being funded by the miners, but in reality it's being funded by the holders in the form of a reduction in the amount of hash rate security they'll receive for a given coin price.  That's one reason I describe the proposal as ""insidious.""  

2. The form of the payment / cost imposed on holders (i.e., a reduction in hash rate / security) also contributes to the insidiousness of the proposal because it's easy to overlook or rationalize. Because ""how much security do we really need?"" is a difficult question that's only really knowable in hindsight. This Hong Kong corporation *probably could* skim 12.5% of the coinbase reward off the top without being the catalyst for a catastrophic 51% attack. The situation is a bit like a jewelry store that decides to fund a kickass office party by temporarily reducing its security staff from two armed guards to only one. If they don't end up getting robbed during the staff reduction, that doesn't mean the move was a responsible one.  

3. If the proposal had been one in which holders paid more directly and transparently through extra inflation (i.e., a ""one-time"" increase in the 21MM coin supply), people would have absolutely freaked the fuck out. The opposition would have been *much* stronger than the opposition we've seen to the current proposal (which has itself been pretty damn strong).

4. That opposition would have been justified.  

5. A similar level of opposition to the current proposal is justified because the two proposals really are quite similar.  Both force holders to pay, and both represent violations of Bitcoin's ""social contract."" As I wrote in the article: ""Investors who bought into Bitcoin did so with the understanding that they were buying into a coin with a certain fixed supply and a certain inflation schedule, and moreover with the understanding that that inflation—*all* of that inflation—would be directed towards incentivizing the chain’s hash rate security.""

6. In other words, certain strong Schelling points in Bitcoin--including the 21MM coin supply, the inflation schedule, and *what that inflation funds* (i.e., hash rate security, i.e., miners owning *all* of the block reward)--are VERY fundamental and important, and we shouldn't begin fucking with them absent an EXTREMELY compelling reason for doing so -- which we're not anywhere *close* to having vis-a-vis this proposal.

>If we do this thing that is good for BCH, we are sure to go crazy and do terrible things due to the slippery slope

Well, I don't think this would be ""good for BCH"" for reasons outlined in Peter Rizun's article. But yes, there is a ""slippery slope"" aspect to my argument. Again, there are certain fundamental Schelling points that should not be tampered with, at least absent truly extraordinary circumstances. But the bottom line is that if you wouldn't support a proposal for dev funding paid for by an increase in the 21MM coin limit, you shouldn't support this proposal either. Indeed, as /u/jessquit argued, the former would actually probably be preferable at least in some ways.  As he put it: ""I'd rather it be funded by some extra future inflation! At the level of fundamentals the extra inflation would be invisible, and frankly at the moment we need all the hashpower we can get."" I think he's got a point. A 0.07% increase in coin supply would be effectively ""invisible"" (at least if we ignore the massive hit to confidence the chain would take if it went down the road). But on the other hand, we *might* very well feel the loss of hash rate.  Right now, BCH is tiny, both relative to BTC (only 4% or so) and relative to the larger financial world.  Other chains have been the victim of successful, large-scale 51% attacks. It's not completely inconceivable that a 12.5% reduction in equilibrium hash rate could tip the scales.";1;1;False;Capt_Roger_Murdock;ffz0k5o;"The ""Dev Tax"" proposal is worse than I thought (and I thought it was pretty bad)";evh02e;https://read.cash/@Roger_Murdock/the-dev-tax-proposal-is-worse-than-i-thought-and-i-thought-it-was-pretty-bad-20d2d5e0

"I forgot you were a BSV guy, Did not mean to personalize the answer to mess with you like that. 

Not sure what investors or 80% of miners you are referring to. If you mean letting BSV fork off, that was just an attempted take-over of BCH. The ""disagreement on how to govern"" was 'CSW's way or the highway'. We chose the highway. The CSW complaints about the hard fork upgrade that was happening back then (as scheduled and well discussed for months in advance) were just a cover story for the attempt to take over BCH with a 51% attack. 

It turns out 51% attacks can cause trouble, but, you can't take over a currency that way unless you can get the community to go along with the takeover (or upgrade). That's how the new BTC owners got away with their capture of BTC... Tricking the community into thinking the small-blockers had real community support. CSW skipped that step until the last minute and was unable to take (fool) much of the community on his crazy development path. It does not sound crazy, so, it did work on some people. I assume most BSV proponents now are big bag holders or paid social engineering agents.

If the 80% of miners were the 51% Calvin was using to try to take over BCH, they were not the kind of honest miners we wanted on BCH anyway.

That is unless you can mind fuck people into not understanding that.

Very occasionally I stop by to laugh. Usually when a portion of the audience is waking up to the fact they've been scammed.

Once again. Ignorance is bliss, it's not I who is unaware of reality when it comes to banning here.

You do realise the *""moderator logs""* are a 3rd party script and don't include all the people who are banned right? What's that? You're talking about things you don't know much about? 

Maybe you should go audit that moderation log a bit and check with some accounts you no longer see around here. I know you've been told by Roger many times that it's legit, but verify for yourself and you may be surprised.

In the current state of BCH it is an entirely useless feature.Actually thats not true, it helped lower Graphene network bandwidth a small amount, but Graphene has only been implemented in the BU client and Graphene would work without CTOR.So much time and energy was WASTED on that unused feature that we «  so desperately needed to have »

Was it worth supporting the divide during a currency split?

Clearly BCH getting CTOR and no split was a better outcome?

Again the result of wrong incentives, BU tried to use the community divide to block a feature because you **had nothing to loose form BCH splitting**
