"I expected this. You have the least to gain and the most relevance to lose by the dev groups getting funding. This is just jumping on the bandwagon, as it's mostly just name-calling, calling the fee a tax, and cooperation collusion. The miners have a right to make decisions, this isn't coming from the developers, but from the rightful stewards of the chain.

BU likely has close to all the funding it needs, from what I've heard. Im not sure if BU is using their funding either, are you guys? ABC and the other node implementations are the ones thats been needing the funding. In fact, I thought this recent infrastructure proposal was Mana from heaven, as it was solving the feud between Roger and Amaury over the 50k. Why wouldn't you want ABC to be funded? 

You made the argument that ""This would corrupt us."" Corrupt who? The miners? Or the developers? Because it doesn't make sense that the miners would get corrupted as this is them taking money out of their pockets to invest in the future of BCH, and it also wouldn't make sense that the developers would get corrupted because they aren't the ones implementing the fund, they are humbly obeying the miners demands, as is their job to do so.

And it's not a ""tax"". Tax implies coercion, which implies violence. Nobodys got a gun held to their head here, nobody is entering any situation where there is a provable breach of contract via theft or fraud. Nobodys private property is being stolen, as block reward is not owned until it is homesteaded, which implies rightfully receiving the money under the consensus rules of the chain. A tax would be taking someone's money from their Bitcoin address, and that would be a 51% attack, as it implies breach of contract and fraud. 

This is simply a fee (like rent expenses), and it wouldn't work if only some followed it, as the ""market cartel"" would immediately dissolve due to game theoretics, and also, because other miners would render the chain unprofitable to mine for the ones in the cartel (the cost/reward ratio of mining is very low, and therefore the slightest changes in the economic picture and have the largest of effects). Do you want Calvin/Nchain and non-BCH-friendly miners to control BCH? If not, then you can't expect miners to individually donate large sums of money, it has to be done collectively.

The blockchain is the private property of the majority-hash miners, as is determined by Satoshi Nakamoto when he created Bitcoin. Bitcoins themselves are the private property of those who rightfully come to own them, through peaceful means. The miners are peaceful in this picture, and are not stealing from anyone.  Nobodys Bitcoin balance is going to go down. And no extra inflation is being forced on the network (which would steal wealth from coin holders). The same coin distribution model is intact, and the majority of the miners who are the rightful stewards of the chain, have decided it's in their best long term interest to grant all the developer groups (you included) a stimulus package, so that they'll be well funded for the next six months to a couple years.";-5;2;False;J-Stodd;ffnwtmi;The Best Of Intentions: The Dev Tax Is Intended to Benefit Investors But Will Corrupt Us Instead;euck8t;https://read.cash/@PeterRizun/the-best-of-intentions-the-dev-tax-is-intended-to-benefit-investors-but-will-corrupt-us-instead-012f5dbd

"Very nice article! I’m honestly floored that such a proposal is being given serious consideration. Thought this excerpt in particular was excellent:

>The point is that once we start paying for one ""super important thing"" it will turn out that there are many other ""super important things"" that also need funding.  It will not be possible to raise taxes sufficiently high to pay for them all. Deciding which of the super important things are the most important will become a politicized process dominated by opportunists jockeying for position at this new faucet of free money.  

>The bitcoin protocol is very simple and was mostly complete in 2009 (by Satoshi).  It is 11 years later and we should be moving towards a stable protocol (without block size limits) and the role of the ""protocol developer"" should be waning.  Many people are passionate about bitcoin and will continue to do the work that needs doing. And as bitcoin becomes more important to businesses—because we attract more users—these business will also have an incentive to contribute.  But with service fees funding a wage assistance program for select developers, these select developers will block initiatives that come from the volunteer devs or companies, to avoid revealing the uselessness of the assistance program.

"Thank you Peter. You have answered almost all the questions i had about this, and made some great points. Something no other BCH dev did or could. Introducing this as a protocol change makes this whole proposal very disingenuous. Because what miners will do does not matter, everyone who does not adhere to this policy will be forked off the network regardless, no matter the hashpower. This looks more like ABC is flexing the power they have over the protocol, since they are the only ones that can make this happen as a protocol change right now.

I seriously can't believe so many prominent people in the BCH community think this is a good idea. Another chain or community split is not something BCH can afford right now, but it's looking like it might happen yet again. This whole fund is going to cost so much more than it could ever theoretically benefit the progress of BCH. And somehow so many people are blind to the consequences.

I'm sad. Human nature is weird.

"I understand your position, but still refuse to compromise my morals.

However, given that I still can't figure out the 4th grade math on how BTC miners are going to ""pay for this"". 

So, the reward for BCH is 12.5% , some miners leave to BTC, BTC gets harder to mine, BTC miners waste more electricity to find the same number of coins, making it less profitable for them. Some miners go out of business, shut down miners, since margins are razor-thin and leave. BTC is probably getting to only ever slightly lower margins within a week or so.

BCH difficulty gets slightly lower, so the miner who spent about $300 per 1 BCH of reward gets to pay maybe $300 per (ideally) 1.13 BCH reward, but now has to give away 12.5%, so he still pays $300 per 1 BCH of reward. It's neither easier for him, nor any more profitable. If less than 12.5% of hash leaves - then it's less profitable for BCH miner and he can't go mining BTC (not enough margin), so he's broke and out of business too, eventually bringing other miners to $300 expense = 1 BCH reward.

BCH holders on the other hand constantly lose money in form of inflation. That's the value that actually goes to the HK corp (mined money that is creating inflation). 

Either I'm misunderstanding what ""pay for this"" means (i.e. it means that BTC miners are losing slightly more money, not that they actually subsidize Bitcoin Cash somehow) or I'm missing some of that 4th grade math.

But if it means the first thing - I don't think it's correct. It's only in the case if no miners go out of business due to being unable to compete (which is what most likely to happen).";1;1;False;readcash;ffomlnh;"PSA: It's shocking how many people here would fail 4th grade math.

"Then that’s a non-spam argument that deserves to be taken into consideration.

I’d personally say that the situation we have on our hands is an economic warfare where BCH has a powerful weapon which it does deserve as its miners are the most rational ones (unlike miners willing to mine BSV at a loss, or miners unwilling to switch from BTC even if profitability is better).

Taxing your opponent to build your infrastructure amidst warfare is not an opportunity that should be missed imo.

Your view on morality does not take into account that what you consider a moral approach to an opportunity that could be weaponised is unlikely to be met with an equally moral response from the other side. Or perhaps it does and you just want to take the purist route.

I say warfare is warfare. As a relative nobody, all I’ve suffered is a DDoS-Ed XT node and some minor trolling, but even that makes me unwilling a to consider how fair this proposition is to BTC-ers.

"Lighthouse was re-developed to an extent as a project called Lighthouse Cash (I never got to test it properly) for Bitcoin Cash, but the developer who did it left BCH during the BSV split.

The project was not kept up to date with subsequent BCH developments.

There is still a repository at https://gitlab.com/lighthouse-cash/lighthouse

Perhaps this could be used as a starting point.

I got the impression that from a tech standpoint, it may not have been ideal. But it was a continuation of Hearn's Java-based work.

Today we have a strong segment of Java expertise within the Bitcoin Cash consensus code community, at least in the form of Bitcoin Verde developers and probably those of other libraries too.

Might be worth asking if any of them would be interested in doing evaluation and report back on what's there, both in quality of code and resources needed to run it.

And maybe they would be interested to give some quotations on improving it, or the community could formulate bounties for getting it up to speed again.

---

We had a number of crowdfunding sites for Bitcoin Cash initially [1]. None of them really made it.

The biggest problem they all didn't solve, in my recollection, is that crowd-sourced pledges need to be returned if a project's funding threshold is not met. This is extremely important, otherwise scam projects abide.

I remember donating to projects (on Akari), who would push out their requested funding mid-way through - another highly frustrating user experience.

Such a project really has to have a good communication infrastructure around it.

"And probably the domain is gone in the split too, idk.

Might be best to set that project up fresh with up-to-date tech.

IIRC, there was also another project called ""Lighthouse"" on another coin developing after BCH split, and if the UX of the old project wasn't great, it maybe best to go for a new image.

Also, AFAIK Lighthouse doesn't work in the same way that the most successful crowdfunding sites do, i.e. pledge, but get your money back if a threshold isn't reached.

IMO without such a get-your-money-back-if-project-flops mechanism, a crowdfunding system is a non-starter.

Do we need good oracles for such a system to work?

"For real though, people not getting it is not an excuse to spam this entire subreddit.

If anything, it's a good reason to stop posting and start reading (4th grade math, or how bitcoin mining works, not sure where your knowledge is lacking).

Here's a simple explanation since it's obviously needed:

Imagine there's only 2 SHA256 currencies: BTC ($9700) and BCH ($300).With these prices, 97% of miners will mine BTC and 3% will mine BCH.

Imagine we implement a 12.5% tax for simplicity's sake.Miners are rational and want to mine for the best possible profit. You're still getting $9700 per btc, but only $262.5 per BCH. The second this happens, enough miners will switch from BCH to BTC so both are equally profitable again.

The end result is not a 12.5% tax levied on BCH miners only - it's a 12.5/100 \* 3/100 tax (0.375%) on all SHA256 miners. It works this way due to the increased difficulty of BTC mining.

There's another drawback - BCH hashrate will drop. This makes it cheaper for Calvin to make a 1 or 2 block reorg attack just so he can fuel his propaganda machine again. I hope miners take this into consideration, too (if they're still planning to go the soft fork route instead of hard forking, I'm not following this until there's more clarity so idk).";6;4;False;fapthepolice;ffnnekh;Why the $6M Development Fund For Bitcoin Cash Will Be Paid by BTC Miners and other BCH News!;eu9py6;https://youtu.be/vFHafbC0HWo

"> why are you so over the top pro for the dev fund?

Two key reasons. I [outlined the first one here](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/eu4ni9/risk_for_bitcoin_cash_up/fflddf6/). The tl;dr is devs pump out tons of value for the community. Without full-node (and to lesser extent other) devs nobody would be in this hundreds of billions of dollar market. Yet devs incur costs to work so hard, giving away production for free. And mostly due to the model/historical precedent for open-source work people mostly take and take without commensurate giving back. That's fine since they signed up for the task, but that doesn't make it not suck.

The second reason, which blows my mind how anybody is objecting is it literally costs zero dollars from anybody. All it does is move funds already marked going from one community necessity (security) to another one (development). Let's put it this way. Say things were reversed. Say the block reward from the start always went 100% to fund developers. They could work comfortably ensuring the infrastructure was the best in the world, beating product giants like Microsoft and increasing coin value for all holders. Then one day someone noticed something and said, ""Hey! there is a gaping security hole if somebody attacked like X!"" and the proposed answer was to take 20% of the existing coin reward going 100% to development and shift it toward properly securing the network. Would people object like they're objecting here?? My goodness.

There are multiple problems. We can't afford to ignore any of them. Here is the thing. *We have a better way to do things.* That's the bottom line. What you must understand is markets are not voting machines they are weighing machines. In the short term markets reflect peoples' votes. However, we know people can be wrong (beware especially of big majorities). People once believed the world was flat (and many still do... :/). But in the *long term* markets are weighing machines, they balance and reflect *actual* value, not perceived value. That's why there are market crashes. The people vote wrongly on actual value.

I was thinking the same. You cannot apply the scenario to price cartels 1 on 1. Because if a (small) miner leaves the cartel his blocks will get orphaned there is no incentive to leave. On the other side there is an incentive to stay in the long run because the speedened up development will increase the value.;1;1;False;GeorgAnarchist;ffmi997;"On the ""cartels are unstable"" argument";eu8hwr;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/eu8hwr/on_the_cartels_are_unstable_argument/

bitcoin is supposed to have byzantine fault tolerance. if 51% of the hashpower colludes then its basically fucking over for the coin.

"Everyone knows hashrate represents work, and for most price doesn't matter. \~136K blocks and counting and the gap of work continues to increase, there's no faking it; every 10 minutes BCH and BSV's ability to 'catch up' become less and less likely to occur, not more.  The probability has only gotten closer and closer to zero since Block 478558. It is math.

Who told you that 'block size' matters? Who told you 'low fee matters'?  Do they have proof why it matters?  Do they know better than the entire world that continues to prove them wrong? Why don't others trust them? Why trade on 'instinct' when there's universally validated data?

With every new block the fact that BCH and BSV are orphaned chains become more and more apparent.  If you're so keen on price, then realize that swings of price (with the coins/money exchanging hands on trades) have no significant impact on this fact, it never has.  BCH and SV are just fighting to see which orphaned chain dies first.  As exciting as trading these are, the trading activity represents exchanging coins/money of fools that believe orphaned chains have value. (be it in Bitcoin or Fiat) At the end of the day, they don't.

"It is just a word. 

Block rewards inflate and devaluate the currency. Everybody in BCH signed up to pay block rewards for security. It is an inherent part of the protocol, just as the 21m coin cap. Tweaking this is imo as fundamental as tweaking the 21m coin cap. Now miners want to channel part of the block reward to developers. This will be at the expense of a drop in hash power, since miners will adjust hash power pointed at BCH to maximize profitability, but the inflation remains the same.

So it is not the miners who will fund development, but the BCH owners. Yet, the mining group in question want to decide how the funds are used. I understand why part of the community refer to it as tax. since it is a involuntary indirect cost payed by BCH owners.

"Marc hits home. An idealist will leave as soon as this central entity (HK corp, DAO, multisig wallet) does something that an idealist doesn't like (gets corrupt, non-transparent, funds something they don't like). And since an idealist also pays for this thing in the form of the inflation - he/she will just leave, not willing to donate any more of her/his time and money to this anymore.

A lot of infrastructure of BCH is build by idealists (I'd say probably between 90% and 99% of all BCH projects don't make enough money for their owners, compared to what they would get on open market, or even losing money). They will leave as soon as this central entity does something they don't like. ""You can please some people all the time, you can't please all the people all the time"" - that practically guarantees that sooner or later far too many idealists will leave. 

I would argue that more than more than 90% of [BCH-specific applications from this list](https://read.cash/@Read.Cash/bitcoin-cash-specific-sites-and-applications-7f03d537) are run by idealists.

It doesn't rob from the rich and give to the poor. I doesn't cost a single person anything in terms of monetary value. It cost the community in terms of *security*, but as I pointed out that's essentially irrelevant:

[The One Thing EVERYONE Must Know About the Dev Funding Plan: IT'S COMPLETELY FREE.](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/et20zo/the_one_thing_everyone_must_know_about_the_dev/)

I don't know why people keep misrepresenting the issue as affecting them in some monetary way. It doesn't. The coinbase reward is *already allocated*. It's 100% already baked in. It goes to security. If you've opted in to Bitcoin (BTC/BCH) you've implicitly agreed with this model, whether you knew it or not. What the funding plan says is, hey, we can use this already spent money which is over spent in one place and use it in another place.

**Edit:** I also want to address another misunderstanding I see out there, which is developers can work ""for free out of love"". Bull. Yes, this is somewhat true but it only goes so far. Devs do work out of charity, but some go far beyond. I'll give examples, starting with Gavin Andresen who seems to be universally liked. Gavin Andresen was the first to press hard for the community to fund valuable Bitcoin development. His solution came in the form of a ""Bitcoin Foundation"" which I objected to (fearing project centralization). That successfully raised funds, then later disbanded and the community sought to fund devs other ways; for example, Gavin was give a paid position for an MIT cryptocurrency program doing essentially the same work. Blockstream formed and was funded etc. 

A key reason developers go beyond charity is twofold. First, one hour of Gavin's time isn't the same monetary value as one hour of the time for the average reddit arrow clicker who does little more than click arrows and check price charts. People with high technical ability have always been able to earn well. If they divert their personal time to a project, that project benefits at the same market value as they could command in the work place, which at Gavin's level is hundreds of dollars per hour, translating to many thousands of dollars per week. Developers don't get this back as donations no matter how much time they spend. Also, a *lead* dev contributes *more* than typical. Any regular employee can leave office stress behind once they clock out, but a lead dev takes on 24/7 responsibility for everything project related, from emergency bugs to media PR, everybody looks to them to perform perfectly. Next, there is costs such as setting up servers, paying for materials, whether research/publication related, attending conferences etc. Devs are charged real world money to do their work. When employed their employer covers these costs. Working freely they pay themselves. Last, who could forget about the stress and cost from things like **getting sued**. That happened to Amaury/BitcoinABC and could have completely ruined/changed his life, but thankfully Roger Ver stepped up. I didn't see the community thank Amaury for putting his neck on the line. ALL this kind of stuff has a cost and takes a toll, but people just sit back and watch events eating popcorn, while mostly never donating a cent.";12;2;False;cryptos4pz;fflddf6;Risk For Bitcoin Cash = Up;eu4ni9;https://read.cash/@MarcDeMesel/risk-for-bitcoin-cash-up-5927bbc8

"I feel the same. I think what's controversial about Jiang's proposal is that the implementation details (HK company, distribution of funds, etc) are not clear. And when details aren't clear, some aspect of trustlessness is lacking. Even if long-term incentives happened to align among devs, miners and users with regards to BCH infrastructure development, the process of enacting a soft consensus rule change involving hardcoded, untrusted addresses sets a dangerous precedent for the future of BCH governance. That is to say, the community would be empowering those particular mining pools with decisions, too much. And although I'd probably trust those specific mining pools due to their past actions and well-earned street-cred, one could still make the argument that rolling by street-cred alone would still be a bit of a stain on BCH history. I'm not sure. One could also argue that their disincentives to betray the entire BCH community is good enough.

I have to admit it felt gross when I first read the proposal, but Bitcoin has always been gross and genius at the same time. Provided that implementation details are refined, made transparent to at least miners and devs, and in doing so achieves significant community consensus, I don't yet see how 6 months of what I'd call ""Jiang Consensus + Nakamoto Consensus"" on the blockchain would be setting a particularly dangerous precedent.

The troll armies became especially aggressive and harmful to rational discussions when the Bitcoin community tried to allow bigger blocks so BTC-Bitcoin could become peer-to-peer electronic cash for the world's people. Their masters captured BTC and broke it permanently. Then they got super aggressive when the Bitcoin community forked off to revive the dream of peer-to-peer electronic cash for the world's people.

They make small issues like the ABC dev infighting seem like a big deal to the community when it is not.

"So here is the proposal that we are talking about: https://medium.com/@jiangzhuoer/infrastructure-funding-plan-for-bitcoin-cash-131fdcd2412e
It includes the passage:

> To ensure participation and include subsidization from the whole pool of SHA-256 mining, miners will orphan BCH blocks that do not follow the plan. This is needed to avoid a tragedy of the commons.

Here is the article by Amaury: https://read.cash/@deadalnix/on-the-infrastructure-funding-plan-for-bitcoin-cash-bd372a10

> The commons are public goods that benefit the ecosystem as a whole, whether each participant pays for it or not. This often leads to the tragedy of the commons, where everybody expects everybody else to fund the commons

These are the so-called free riders who don't want to support infrastructure, are to be punished by the cartel by having their blocks orphaned and block rewards taken away.

edit: later in the article, Amaury refers to such miners as parasites:

> The people who care most about the system will voluntarily fund commons, while people who decide to be parasitic and use the commons without funding them will not.

If you make and enforce no laws about fishing, then sooner or later all (edit: commercially viable to fish) fish will be gone(edit: or at such low levels that commercially fishing them makes no sense anymore and the yield of fishing is unprofitable and the rate of the number of fish replenishing is a fraction of what it would be if people had stopped fishing a lot earlier, while it was still economically viable.), due to obvious reasons. You cannot enforce laws without some use of force (violence). So the result of your opinion is that in 50, 100 or 200 years many kinds of fish will be effectively gone due to over-fishing.

"**Tragedy of the commons**

The tragedy of the commons is a situation in a shared-resource system where individual users, acting independently according to their own self-interest, behave contrary to the common good of all users by depleting or spoiling the shared resource through their collective action. The theory originated in an essay written in 1833 by the British economist William Forster Lloyd, who used a hypothetical example of the effects of unregulated grazing on common land (also known as a ""common"") in Great Britain and Ireland. The concept became widely known as the ""tragedy of the commons"" over a century later due to an article written by American biologist and philosopher Garrett Hardin in 1968. In this modern economic context, ""commons"" is taken to mean any shared and unregulated resource such as atmosphere, oceans, rivers, fish stocks, roads and highways, or even an office refrigerator.

"> Every association will have ways for its rules to be changed. One person decides, simple majority, qualified majority, unanimity...

But this is not a simple rule change. This is a change about the fundamental economics of BCH. Imagine if they decided to increase the block reward in order to pay the devs, would that also be a simple upgrade? It is one thing to make a new rule like no spitting in the pool. It is another making everybody pay for something new that they don't want to pay for and won't even get a say in how it will be spent.

> Stop saying there's force involved. You know there isn't, making your accusation a calumny.

I am sorry but I will not stop saying this. There clearly is force involved, directed at the so-called free-riders that will lead to the so-called tragedy of the commons -- which is a justification for many statist centralization initiatives historically, by the way. Would you call a 51% attack, force, BTW?

Unfortunately it might come to this, but hopefully not. The fact that this is being planned as a possible soft-fork will also make this harder.

Well in this comment chain I specifically wanted to discuss the ethics. There are plenty of other threads (some of which I am participating in) discussing the practical issues. If you prefer, you can join in on those. To my mind there is a serious ethical issue involved. Force committed by a majority is still force.

I've actually heard it argued that it's only Calvin Ayre's mining that will be affected anyway, and fuck Calvin anyway, so it's OK to commit force against him.

If a central organization distributes the funds and chooses to exclude minority nodes then I will take it as a slight against the value we (Verde, BCHD, Flowee) bring to the ecosystem.  Additionally, if a central organization excludes BU then we will widening the political divide and may be setting us up as a single node implementation ecosystem.

If funds are donated directly from a miner and all of them exclude minority node implementations (as individual organizations) then I'm more amicable.  It is their money and they are allowed to not see value in software they aren't running.  I would hope they see value in our future and would choose to donate, but that is their decision to make.

I already suggested a solution for this. Will someone say why it's a bad idea? I said the distribution of the funds should be in proportion to the last development fundraiser. We're fortunate to have that knowledge in this case. Again, for those that don't know we *just had an ecosystem wide fundraiser*. This was *not* any central plan. It was hosted centrally (by Bitcoin.com), but others followed their lead and echoed the call for donations. BitcoinCash.org had the fundraiser front and center on the home page. I put a forum sticky up on BitcoinCashForum.online. IIRC r/btc had a reference to it, and probably many other sites. It was ecosystem wide and the whole ecosystem could donate to individual or multiple projects as well as a 'general' fund. That *was a vote* on who should get what. Not much has changed, so why can't we just use the numbers we got from there and transpose it to the $6M proportionally?

Miners have the best information about the software they use and the needs they have for it.

"Given as we're all cryptocurrency supporters, I find it funny that we're discussing the pros and cons of centralization vs decentralization, which is really what this is.

If we have a big pool, controlled by the 51% of miners for example. What's to prevent them from going ""hey everyone, let's just split all funds between us""?

Nothing except the community hardforking away from the chain, in which case the 51% miners can just follow along... We're basically fucked, and they can go blow the money on drugs and hookers or whatever.

So let's just give the funds to someone else. Say, uh, the ABC developers! Surely they have the best interest of BCH in mind? Maybe, but if they decide to give themselves 99% of the money (maybe by creating proxy developers to create the ""Thunder Network"" to solve all our problems), what can we do about it then?

Maybe if we can convince the miners that this isn't working out. But how do we do that, if they're adept at hiding how the money is spent?

If miners can choose themselves which projects or development teams or even ""development pools"" (who can then distribute  the money per project basis) then these problems pretty much disappear.

It would also be more fair, if say only 5% of miners favor a certain implementation. Then that implementation would receive 5% of the funds, while a big pool would most likely place more weight on the popular choice or maybe even disregard the minority clients completely.

It's painfully obvious to me it's superior if miners can donate directly to projects. What's there to even debate?

(Well, I guess ABC developers would prefer it going into one big pool, since they would likely benefit from it more than having miners donating directly, given they're the most popular client.

"If the miner that gets the block is choosing, anti-BCH miners may game the system and use that power to donate in a way that helps least or not at all. I think we need to limit the options to projects that are most important and determine the distribution ratios in a way that is best for BCH. Who should make such decisions and how should they determine the best ratios is a serious challenge for various reasons. The troll army of lying social engineers will be vocal disrupters of any community efforts to come to consensus.

EDIT: I also wonder if there are some projects that would be helpful to all or most of the node teams.

I agree. I don't like the look of this and it's throwing around a centralized idea that will leave a sour taste for years. I would gladly support the devs with my very own coin as I have in the past. But baking this in leaves a precedent for future upgrades. I unfortunately cannot support this Idea. I love BCH and all it stands for as the community has grown. But this is a massive change. BCH was the last Bitcoin to carry us forward. Now I'm not so sure. And unfortunately I dont favour many of the other top ten coins besides Eth. But Eth isn't much of a world money as Bitcoin Cash.

Bitcoin has survived for over a decade with contributions from those who seek a world free from control. And BCH has made incredible achievements. A bitcoin cash fund has brought in considerable donations before. Surely we could continue to fund BCH like this. The greatest development should flourish from this method.

Yes it does, its not that bad. We just need some predefined rules, like everyone has to donate.

If there is too much hashing, then some less efficient miners will drop off and a new hashing equilibrium will be reached.

"1. Any forum which is editable by anyone and these posts can be put together will do.

2. This is a whitelist that's 'averaged over time'. For example, for dev addresses a, b, c, d, and e if we have the funding lists for 10 blocks looking like:
[a, b] [a, b] [a, b, c] [a, b, c] [a, c] [a, e] [a, b, c] [a, e] [a, b, c] [b]
Then for the next block to be accepted by the network, miners would have to send 12.5% of the coinbase to a, b or c as they appear at least 5 times. Miners can put their own address on the funding list in one block but it won't have any effect unless they mine 5 blocks in any consecutive 10 blocks.

3. If no address appears at least 5 times, 12.5% has to be sent to some pre defined burn address. This is to reduce the incentive of not agreeing on worthy developers to contribute to i.e. the 12.5% is always lost, but hopefully always to a dev.

Does this explanation clear things up? I feel like you've misunderstood the proposal.
They do vote to contribute to a whitelist... each block.

- Give kickbacks to anyone that includes your projects
- Include projects who also participate in the kickback scheme

Politically, BCH will not be able to remove this stain easily if at all. I am just a small fish but I did not fight for Bitcoin, start a business aimed at permissionless solutions, and donate significant portions of my net worth for BCH to become another fiat ecash, regardless of its market cap.

As I have said many times before, we need to expect the road to surviving and thriving as a permissionless coin to be hard. Really hard. Anything that looks like an easy solution and a free lunch is probably a tarpit, regardless of good or bad intentions.

I am very happy that mining pools are making an active proposal that *intends* to benefit BCH. This kind of public and proactive stance is what I dreamed about in 2017.

"What's expensive with remittance is not converting currencies (that's the cheap part), but running the infrastructure allowing to deposit and to pay out cash.

First, those high fees also apply to your Bitcoin ATMs: [You pay around 6.3% in one direction](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/etxo21/croatian_post_office_offering_crypto_to_cash/fflc4ms/). Having to buy crypto with cash and then selling it again for cash is going to put your overall fees above 10% - and thereby way above what Western Union would charge.

Second, the reason why a certain demographic uses cash-based remittance is often because they're not familiar with cheaper methods. If they don't know how to handle electronic payments on a bank account it's even more unlikely that they will know how to securely handle crypto.

In that sense, there has always been a ""dev hash war"" as you seem to want to call it, among those nodes that want to compete in that field.

In a broader sense, all BCH devs together, are competing for hash rate against the devs of other SHA256 coin implementations. It would be a strategic mistake to get too comfortable about that.

"It was not sabotage. The Bitcoin white paper was nothing more than an idea that was untested. After we had the first running prototype we got insights into its potential but also about its shortcomings. 

You still don't get it do you? Right now in BCash the miners try to shove a protocol change down your throat. And you can't do anything against it because your network is not decentralised and you have few full nodes. BCash is a corporate controlled form of money like if paypal would have it's own issued currency. You could argue that's fine with you but that was definitely not the idea of Satoshi.

Even if the course gets reversed, this crisis clearly demonstrated how easy it is to to take over BCH for a group of people with just about enough hash power. CSW was threatening to do this, but that was easy to dismiss, because he is a clown. I have always been hoping that miners being interested in keeping integrity will never allow attacks to happen, but what do I know. Miners themselves are the source of compromise, because they would rather destroy their chain than God forbid see anybody freeloading. It is very hard at this time to believe that they didn't know what they are doing.

"technically you can stop double spends using the protocol rules. Eg if several pool of miners blacklist all BCH owned by CSW  they can attempt to reorg any transaction that attempts to spend them. Or when the unknown miner tried to claim the segwit funds and several pools of miners reorged that transaction because they did not trust the intent of that miner. 

How are developers supposed to stop this? Maybe devs and the community can try and shame the pools into not doing this? *( but i dont think this is wise )* 

From a technical standpoint - the reorg of blocks that don't donate to the dev fund and the reorg of the segwit funds are exactly the same thing. This community calls one a tax and the other the 51% defense. The reality is both these things are the same and really there's no possible protocol rule to prevent  miners from doing this.

This community is just trying to shame the miners ( who a trying to do the right thing ) and save a project that they are heavily invested in. They have an incentive to do this.

It does not. It makes it a consensus rule if non-mining nodes only follow the chain that adheres to this ""Infrastructure funding plan"" and dismisses blocks that claim the whole coinbase for themselves, instead of following the longest chain. This would be the difference between a protocol change and a rule that is just enforced by 51% of the hashpower, which comes solely from the miners.

"Like most people, I think it is a worthwhile experiment to have more money available for development at the cost of reducing the hash rate (aka security) of the coin a bit. Emin put is best: ""The trade off here is slightly lower hash rate for BCH, in exchange for developer funding. This is sensible: empirically, more attacks have been due to underfunded devs than to malicious hashrate.""

What many in the community seem to take issue with is that the current plan is needlessly centralizing power in the hands of a few trusted people. I and other people have proposed alternatives along the lines of

* Development teams publish donation addresses. It would be fun to store the addresses on the blockchain but I do not think this is strictly necessary
* When a miner finds a new block he can choose to include a donation
* If a miner finds a block that does not contain a donation he can choose to orphan it.

I cannot find problems with this approach that are not present in the current plan. It seems much simpler than what is proposed.

If it is decided the miners will make the decision, I am fine with that since they are making the donation happen. I believe a large percentage of miners are anti-BCH, so, I want an open public decision making process that does not let them game the donation system and send donations to where they do the least good.";1;0;False;Big_Bubbler;ffnpz9o;I am a BCH miners and I propose a white list of predefined dev funding addresses that will be updated every 6 months;etpkad;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/etpkad/i_am_a_bch_miners_and_i_propose_a_white_list_of/
If we make donations dependent on publicly discoverable nodes, how would we be able to donate to independent devs that do work on something else that's not a node implementation? And projects like flowee only have one discoverable node running.

Is it possible to bake the address to the software itself, so the donation is proportional to the number of nodes currently active or fund directly to the node that the pool is running?;1;1;False;nghiacc;ffjzzg8;I am a BCH miners and I propose a white list of predefined dev funding addresses that will be updated every 6 months;etpkad;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/etpkad/i_am_a_bch_miners_and_i_propose_a_white_list_of/
"The scenario you assume only works under the following premises:

1) A donation system woudl have to be integrated via a protocol change that all node clients support and integrate into their upgrades

2) There would have to be an alternative client version upgrade that excludes any kind of donation system built in so that non participating miners fork off into an alternative chain.

&#x200B;

If there is no donation system build in via protocol, no alternative node client offered to fork opposing miners off, and donations are simply forced by those 4 pool owners selectively orphaning blocks, then there will be a hash war as explained by me above. To assume that all opposing miners will just immediately switch to BTC or BSV is not ensured. And knowing that half of BCH hash rate comes from unknown miners, and knowing that the other pools have not yet declared support or opposition to the proposal, you cannot make assumptions like the one above. Doing that is as bad as spreading FUD.";1;1;False;grmpfpff;ffnthz5;I am a BCH miners and I propose a white list of predefined dev funding addresses that will be updated every 6 months;etpkad;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/etpkad/i_am_a_bch_miners_and_i_propose_a_white_list_of/

"I had a 6-month contract with pool.bitcoin.com around the same time! Mid-2017 to January 2018. It was a good crash course on mining because that covered the the split, the massively-gamed EDA, and the change to the new DAA. I about broke even, hard to calculate with the fork in the middle.

The 5 pools that signed the [blog post](https://medium.com/@jiangzhuoer/infrastructure-funding-plan-for-bitcoin-cash-131fdcd2412e) are antpool, btc.com, btc.top, viabtc and bitcoin.com. So basically Bitmain et al + Roger.

I'm having a hard time understanding the impact of some of the enforcing pools being PPS-only. I'm thinking the small miners that own their own equipment will switch to BTC-only pools. Even contracts on Bitcoin.com can click the option to only mine BTC. The BCH hashrate won't suffer overall because the ""enforcers"" will need to stay on BCH at a loss in order to enforce the donation scheme. This is why they really do have rights to control that fund... they're going to be mining at a loss compared to BTC-only miners, and BTC-only miners won't necessarily lose a penny. It might require so much hashrate on BCH to enforce that the small miners on BTC will make more money than if this plan never existed. And if they're BCH proponents, they'll take that extra BTC profit and trade it for BCH.

Thanks for the insights, I'm really still working through it. But the more I think about it, the more this is the same outcome as if the 5 pools donated straight to an infra fund (without small miners donating anything) but with the bonus that the DAA gamer will be dis-incentivized. And a second possible bonus of finally exhibiting that hashrate does have power, which did not show up in the BTC/BCH split.";1;1;False;melllllll;ffjb3ib;The BCH community in Thailand is amazing!;etpagm;https://www.instagram.com/p/B7vDBdYAam5/?igshid=1ktoaiz27i4bz

"Antpool, ViaBTC and Bitcoin.com offer PPLNS mining reward systems (at least they did when i was mining). The only contract i ever had was with Genesis waaaaay back in early 2017 which actually ended up paying REALLY well before they canceled it. I was shocked. 

Anyways, the PPLNS payment gives you reward based on how much work you did against the total work for a given block. There's a ramp up and ramp down of rewards but that's inconsequential to this conversation. Anyways, there will be 12.5% less rewards to spread around to the PPLNS miners which means that for them to actually want to mine BCH the reward for mining BCH vs BTC will have to be 12.5% higher or more. If the market doesn't absorb this fee by a greater BCH price we're going to bleed more miners. 

How many? i have no idea. I really have no concept as to what is owned by the pool and what are individual miners in the pool hash rates. 

Contract miners dont have as much skin in the game and they're excursively on a contract payout method which is different than PPS and PPLNS. I'm talking about small time equipment owners like myself that are going to take off.

"Interestingly, this is not a new idea. Others in the past have tried diverting funds to a central entity, with few or no strings attached, precisely in order to decrease that central entity's susceptibility to bribery.

Ancient Israel had no king and no taxes from the time they left Egypt under Moses, up until many generations later. Before they had a king, they had ""judges"" who arbitrated legal disputes, led them in battle when the nation was attacked and took only voluntary donations for doing so.

The reason why the Israelites first proposed the installation of a monarchy (with the power to tax) was because they found that some unscrupulous judges were taking bribes (1 Samuel 8:1-2). They figured that if they appointed a king to tax them, the king would not be vulnerable to that temptation, since the taxes guaranteed his income.

God solemnly warned them that if they went down this road, the long-term effect would be onerous taxes that would turn them into the king's defacto slaves (1 Samuel 8:17).

More recently, a French bishop named Jacques-Benigne Bossuet proclaimed that the judgement of the king (presumably Louis XIV at the time) was fully identified with ""the public good"", because God had raised the king to a condition where he no longer had anything to desire for himself. [Taken from page 251 of ""Economic Thought Before Adam Smith"", by Murray Rothbard].

With SegWit it was about future deniability.

Thankfully BCH evaded both of these existential problems owing to ABC/Amaury's effort.

So why is there a ""delayed problem"" in this case?

Two reasons in this case:

1. it further limits new miner entrants in favor of incumbents beyond having to deal with the volatility of having to pay fiat for electricity in order to generate pow proofs.
2. it will lead to an eternal fight over the apportionment of distribution of the collected funds decided by a ""trusted"" third party or consortium.

assumption 2. this proposal forces people to donate.  
Actually it does not, miners would not even lose any profitability in this as they can change the percentage of their hashrate that they mine on each sha256 chain, and the bch difficulty will adjust anyway. miners are free to mine what they want & retain the same profitability, and the majority of pro-bch miners controlling the fund get the possibility to fund BCH protocol development.";1;1;False;zhell_;ffmn1o2;Miner’s Plan to Fund Devs - Mega Thread;etfz2n;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/etfz2n/miners_plan_to_fund_devs_mega_thread/

It's very border line. I think it's a step too far for me.

> If you are on the opposing side of this proposal you can, and should, form your own cartel and oppose it, that's nakamoto consensus, is it not?

I'm not going to be able to form a cartel. I am not a software engineer, I will not be able to build a pool. All I can do is show people my point of view and listen to others in case there is some information I (or they) do not have that could change an opinion.

Which was in no way sufficient. There are so many unanswered questions / unknown details.

> The sun might super-nova tomorrow, we should not address that issue before anything else! ... Please address the issue of the super-nova so we can move forward.

I feel like you're still missing the point. Miners can not control a super nova. A majority of miners could enforce a miners' tax or increase the 21 million coin supply. Are both of these things acceptable changes just because the miners *could* do it?

> That you have a preference in the manner in which anyone does anything in respect to their SHA256 hash is simply your preference, is not enforceable. You merely wish to be kept in the loop because it is human nature.

This is probably true. As I have bitcoin cash I have an interest in where it is going and if it is still what I consider what I originally bought. We are handing the keys to bitcoin cash to whoever controls this fund. I worry this is too much power.

> If you do and you oppose this proposal why haven't you signaled that opposition through nakamoto consensus?

Because this requires significant investment that I can not provide.

> No. If a pool, or some entity that controls a significant amount of SHA256 hash, decides to oppose this proposal, how should they go about opposing? 

Just by not orphaning blocks that don't pay to this company.

> Should they announce that they oppose?

Yes, so that like minded miners can join their pool.

> If they do not announce their proposal, but oppose the proposal as the proposal becomes a reality how would you feel about that? 

I feel like the only choices the miners have is to go along with the proposal, orphaning blocks that don't pay or don't go along with the proposal and not orphan blocks. What do the proposal opposing pool need to explain? Am I missing something here?

I don't think we are really disagreeing on most of the rest of your comment.

"> It would very likely be a profitable move(plus it would be bad for BCH, maybe a reason for some), Idk how likely it is to happen.

I am not sure what ""it"" you are referring to. Would you be willing to specifically lay out what the ""it"" is?

> The thing with **BTC death-spiraling however is surely near-impossible,** too many people have too much money at stake to let that happen, in this way.

You, or I, do not know what will happen. That you believe it is a near-impossibility does not make it a near impossibility.

I am not saying it will happen, merely that I can envision it happening. Are you good with math? I'm not, anymore... used to be decades ago... but not anymore.

Let us say (because I read it somewhere) that the 4 mining pools, let us call them Cartel Pro-BCH, that support this proposal control exactly 28% of the BCH SHA256 hash. That equates to 9.3% (please check my math) of the total SHA256 hash (I base this off of BTC = 97%, BCH = 3%, BSV = I don't give a shit about)

I also assume (no, I don't have any evidence) that these 4 mining pools, together, control more than 9.3%, of the total SHA256 hash. 

For opposition, let us call them Anti-Development/Pro Rent Seeking Cartel (it's my story I get to chose the names!!) to cancel the Cartel Pro-BCH miners the Anti-Development/Pro Rent Seeking Cartel will need at least twice the amount of SHA256 hash that the Cartel Pro-BCH control. Currently the other 72% of the BCH SHA256 hash has that amount, so in theory if that 72% of BCH hash is against the proposal, then the proposal will amount to wasted electricity. Do you really think the Cartel Pro-BCH are stupid/insane enough to simply through away their costs to fail? 

I do not believe they are that stupid, so that leads me to believe that they either have SHA256 parked mining on another chain (BTC) or sitting in reserves to crush anyone stupid enough to challenge them. I could be wrong though.

Assuming the Cartel Pro-BCH do have SHA256 parked elsewhere mining (BTC) or sitting in reserves, in the event that Anti-Development/Pro Rent Seeking Cartel opposes the Cartel Pro-BCH miners, then the Anti-Development/Pro Rent Seeking Cartel will need at least 20% of the total SHA256 hash. Where they get that hash might be important. If they get it all from BTC, that reduces the security of BTC by... what... 20%? and increases the time it will take for BTC to readjust their difficulty, while BCH adjusts (I think) every block and disallows reorgs longer than 10 blocks.

Now... back to my assumption that the Cartel Pro-BCH does control more than 9.3% of the total SHA256 hash and it is sitting on BTC. For the Cartel Pro-BCH to meet the challenge, and they have the requisite hash, they move an additional 9.3% of the total hash from BTC to BCH, that is now a net loss of 29.3% of the BTC hash lost, decreasing the BTC security and time it will take for BTC to adjust their difficulty. AND!! BCH is now (at that moment and until one of the cartels gives up completely in the intervening 6 months) 38.6% of the SHA256 hash. Does value follow hash? We'll see. If it does... YAY! If it doesn't we'll have at least one data set proving otherwise.

"Basically masternodes lock in the first block.  So if another block at the same height comes along it can't change the chain simply by having more hashrate behind it.  It would need to have not only a majority of miners behind it long enough to become the longest chain, but also a majority (realistically about 60%) of the masternodes.

Having 51% of the miners is hard.  Having 60% of the masternodes is practically impossible.  Just under 50% of all Dash are already in masternodes.
