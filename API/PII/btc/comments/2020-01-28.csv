[Here](https://blockchair.com/bitcoin-cash/blocks?s=size\(desc\)#) are the biggest blocks mined on bch (32mb). I imagine your 250mb block was mined on a testnet, not in real conditions. In fact, mining a big block in not the hard part, it's propagating it. That's why we still have a 32mb blocksize limit at the moment. And we are aiming at 1Gb block.

">Sure. But miners get coinbases, businesses and users get less fees than others payment systems, exchanges take a service fee. Only devs get nothing (except donations but they aren't sufficient) for the code they provide. And they are the first link in the chain. 

Just for the record, the first link in the chain was Satoshi, and then miners and developers got into it at the same time. None can be spared to keep Bitcoin running. But the last ones of the two that will stay will be the miners who will provide the infrastructure. 

And Miners just collect coinbases... Just like that? Have you ever calculated how many months, or now years, it takes to make enough block rewards to pay off one single ASIC besides paying for all the electricity, Internet, cooling, space? We just pile up money I assume? So all the miners that turned off their asics and threw them on big piles in 2018 when the bubble popped just retired being filthy rich?

A person who wants to mine needs to invest in:
- asics
- electricity infrastructure to get serious Amps to the miners
- a reliable Internet connection
- cooling
- collocation space
- mining pool accounts, payout addresses, firewalls, nodes

Thousands of dollars and plenty of time spend before(!) he can even start mining and collect his first block reward he desperately needs to start paying off that debt he got from the start. Since the money must come from somewhere, he probably builds up his first mining business from savings he accumulated from his other job. 

And as soon as everything is finally paid off (with luck), his asics are already so outdated that he needs to buy new asics so the cycle repeats. Since he was just able to pay off his previous investment, he has to take savings from his other job again. Unless he managed to have block rewards left to sell when a bubble emerges that allows him to sell old mined coins for enough profit to pay off his investment earlier. 

Starting to develop for Bitcoin does not involve this significant investment at the beginning. A dev invests time and experience, and the investment to do that increases proportionally to the amount of time he spends coding. A dev can chose how much he invests by choosing the time and also his own rate for dedicating himself to Bitcoin development. 

A miner does not have this choice. He has to do a significant initial investment if he wants to make profit at all, and the prices are dictated by the providers of the hardware, electricity, Internet. And as soon as a miner has invested all this money, he cannot simply turn back. Stopping would mean instant loss of the remaining investment.

The moment a dev stops dedicating himself to develop for Bitcoin, his investment in Bitcoin ends. He has full control of the risk. 

>Maybe they should sell updates of their node implementation as their service fee, but that would wipe all the small miners.

We small miners mine in pools anyways that we have to pay fees to. If devs asked for money for their Updates, pools would have to pay it and hand it down to the miners.

Calling the block-reward a subsidy is a perverse twisting of logic. The blockreward is pay for work done. The work needs to be done (Bitcoin would fail without mining) and people don't work for free. That is not a subsidy. We call that pay. Wages. Or, in simple English: a reward for work done. A subsidy ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidy)) is a social measure, created by government.

Using this weird view of block-rewards he goes on to conclude that:

I don't really know if you can just compare the two. The point of the mining reward is to make Bitcoins available for the network and give miners an incentive to keep the network secure. You cannot make Bitcoins available in any other way, while you can raise money for development in any other way imaginable.

While it's true this dynamic can exist, I think you're being unfair here. I'd like to think they want to block the cartel proposal because they, as do I, see it as incompatible with a decentralized network such as BCH should be. Bitcoin Verde, who aren't exactly swimming in funds, thinks the same.

The hostility isn't against developer financing, in fact quite the opposite as people everywhere are now pledging more donations and we're all here discussing how to better finance developers aren't we? The hostility is focused on a central party handling the donations and that miners are forced to ""donate"".

> Show me an alternative financing proposal that has an equally realistic chance of success and I'll seriously consider it. 

Monero's [Community Crowdfunding System](https://ccs.getmonero.org/) has been extremely successful, and there are for example several researchers who've been paid full-time. (Which is something very needed, in addition to developers.)

The only remaining issue is the one of transaction acceptance. However in practice it's not an issue at all...It only takes 300 micros per txn on average to accept a txn in a 500 txn long chain which means even if all transactions were long chains (which we know they will not be, not even close) then we could still do conservatively 10K per second tx admission on a 4 way BU node running on a laptop.

"> But the miners are in control. So even if the Corp went wrong, they could just redirect funds to somewhere else.

At what cost though? Unfortunately this change has lasting effects across the network. For example, it forces out non-donating miners introducing much higher levels of centralization which impacts everyone. In addition, less miners will make the difficulty drop and weaken our security. Again, this impacts all of us. So there are trade-offs for ""the miner's corp"" that they control. Sure it's *their* money to do what they want with, I agree with that, but to get to that point there are some things that must be sacrificed by us all first. An easy remedy for the corp. is to simply abolish it and use p2p electronic cash, BCH, to give directly to the devs. Problem solved on that one.

"Bit Active is not about bitcoin cash at all.

I actually am starting to like Bitcoin SV.

**Craig is not the lead developer** and if the project is any more successful, Craig will not be able to unilaterally control the project. Craig knows he can't program and eventually there's no reason or ability for him to have unilateral control of the software. Even if Craig just owns the ""[BitcoinSV.com](https://BitcoinSV.com)"" domain name it doesn't mean anything. We've seen this, Roger owns [Bitcoin.com](https://Bitcoin.com), does he control the bitcoin software? No.

(I don't even know if Craig owns the domain name, we know owning a domain gives you no control. If you're into the original vision of bitcoin and this software is proven. You can fork Craig off the project)

Next hard fork will remove the block cap all together.

What else do you want?

"Awesome.

I really think voluntary funding can work. 

We just need to get things organized a little better. You can see from my donations that I'm basically just throwing money around randomly. I'd much rather do it in a more structured and sustainable way.
I'd really love to see a site that shows all the ""fundable"" things and lets poeple distribute their donations in an easy way. That way, the picking of what exactly gets funded is done in a decentralized manner (each donator chooses what he funds) and we don't get corruption, cronyism, politicization and so on that come with centralizing and having a couple dudes do that job.

The question is: even if it can be pulled off initially, is decentralized voluntary funding going to be sustainable in the long run? Matching the IFP it's pretty easy because that itself is limited to 6 months, so one huge fundraiser now with the fear in the community in the sails could do it. But in the long run we need some good tools and even more importantly a broad widespread culture of donating and understanding of the benefits (it's a win-win-win situation, really)";7;1;False;moleccc;ffutbhc;Donations of a fish - on voluntary development funding.;ev464b;https://read.cash/@molecular/donations-of-a-fish-on-voluntary-development-funding-2631238a

"I don't see it like a tax. 

I saw it as a way for miners to get involved. They would take a cut of their coinbase, but this would go to the Devs so they would invest in the very thing they are mining.

We can debate this forever, but I don't think the miners were going to steal the money, or spend them on useless things. We have a Roadmap and I think they actually wanted to get involved: [https://www.bitcoincash.org/roadmap.html](https://www.bitcoincash.org/roadmap.html)

We can kiss this goodbye.

Curious...

Do you believe:

* all blocks that have been previously orphaned were the result of theft

* all blocks that may be orphaned in the future are theft

I ask this because many believe, and it seems yourself included, that in the event the proposal becomes reality that all blocks orphaned that do not conform to the majority rule of the miners would be theft.

But there is a problem, as I see it. If a block is orphaned then that block did not earn the block reward. The block that replaced it earned the block reward. Or, at least it earned it until the entity that minded that block is able to spend it... 100 blocks later.

"**Pay-as-you-earn tax**

A pay-as-you-earn tax (PAYE), or pay-as-you-go (PAYG) in Australia and the United States, is a withholding tax on income payments to employees. Amounts withheld are treated as advance payments of income tax due. They are refundable to the extent they exceed tax as determined on tax returns. PAYE may include withholding the employee portion of insurance contributions or similar social benefit taxes.

"Preface: I am playing 'devil's advocate' for the first few weeks.

From your article:

> We feel the precedence set by cooperating with mining pools limits the power granted by miners to represent their best interests.

I want to point out to you, and everyone else, that if you, or anyone else, has a problem with cartels, they should have problems with mining pools themselves. Mining pools are cartels in their own right. Do you, reading this, have a problem with mining cartels?

Yes, I am aware that some/most will strain applications of logic to try to dismiss this assertion; I'll enjoy reading them.

> Ultimately, we believe this nuanced difference is the distinguishment between miner ~~pool~~ coordination and miner ~~pool~~ collusion.

Mining pools are cartels. 

Are you a miner? Are you a member of a pool? You are already a member of a cartel.

> This debate has further reinforced our opinion that lack of mining node diversity is a problem. We have great respect for the Bitcoin ABC and Bitcoin Unlimited teams, and I consider many of their members personal friends of mine. We are not a replacement, nor are we a competitor.

I really appreciate your honesty and willingness to illustrate that Bitcoin Verde is a cartel and competitors of BU, ABC, et al.

"> Bitcoin Verde will be asking for funding on a feature-by-feature basis. 
> 
> Features will be ranked by the funding amount donated; each funded feature will be prioritized over our own personal roadmap. Higher funding amounts equals higher relative importance.
> 
> We plan to have two funding mechanisms. Funding anonymously/distributedly via github and funding via traditional contracts.
> 
> Each issue posted on github will have its own BCH address. A github issue may have a minimum budget/goal before execution begins. Each issue's title and funding address will be signed with Verde's primary funding address to prevent any misdirection of funds.
> 
> Contractual contributions can be created by reaching out to us via email or Telegram. A contractual contribution normally includes a statement of work. With that, we will issue an estimate and define a payment structure. This is the same process we've been executing for 9 years as a custom software organization.
> 
> Issues funded via github and issues funded via contractual contributions will be evaluated with the same priority relative to one another at the time the contract is executed. This means public github donations can compete fairly with contractual contributions. Public contributions are no less important than contractual obligations. However, once work begins on any obligation, the feature will not be re/de-prioritized until it is complete.

Guess we better add in a marketing fund too. After all, spending my time, money, and effort promoting BCH adoption, as I do, is game-theoretically irrational. For example, the future individual benefit I might hope to receive from helping a stranger at a meetup get set up with a phone wallet and funding it with a dollar or two worth of BCH is extremely attenuated. (Heck, I remember giving strangers 0.1 BTC to get them started back in 2012 / early 2013.)  How much do we need? I'd say another 12.5% ought to cover us, don't you think?  Where should the marketing company receiving these funds be incorporated? Dev funding will be Hong Kong so maybe a different jurisdiction for this one, you know, for decentralization purposes?

In case my sarcasm wasn't clear, I don't *actually* support such a change.  Yes, there's a bit of a free-rider problem when it comes to bitcoin protocol development. Of course, that was true in 2009 and 2010 when Bitcoin was incredibly tiny, obscure, and essentially worthless.  The free rider problem *should* be a lot *easier* to overcome 11 years later at a time when crypto has become almost mainstream, has made many early adopters extremely wealthy, and at a time when the protocol *should* be ossifying.  As Peter Rizun put it in his recent article: 

>The bitcoin protocol is very simple and was mostly complete in 2009 (by Satoshi).  It is 11 years later and we should be moving towards a stable protocol (without block size limits) and the role of the ""protocol developer"" should be waning.

"> It's not really a straw man if it's part of the proposal.

It's a straw man because it wasn't part of the argument I was making, nor is it part of an argument that any reasonable person would make.

I was suggesting that if you want a voluntary system that doesn't suffer from the freerider problem, you should be proposing an assurance contract. 

Personally, I want a compulsory system that doesn't suffer from the freerider problem, so I prefer the miner tax.

> It's a consensus change, not a contract.

Consensus rule changes are contracts with enforcement.

> This proposal would have made users, developers and other purely economic actors free riders too.

Actually, it doesn't. They all pay for the measure with slightly reduced hashrate security and increased risk of reorg attacks. The 12.5% reduction in available mining revenue results in 12.1% of the BCH hashrate switching over to mining BTC. Both BTC and BCH miners see a 0.49% reduction in revenue after difficulty adjusts.

The freerider issue in having miners donate voluntarily is exacerbated by the competitive zero-sum nature of mining and the way pools work. If BTC.top decides to donate 5% of their coinbases to development, and if they keep 3% to fund their own operations, then they have to charge their miners a fee of 8%. Those miners would then switch over to a different pool that has lower fees.

But more generally, if you can levy a tax that fairly and evenly affects one cross-section of the economy, you can solve the freerider problem without taxing every single person. For example, if you levy a tax only on farming, there are no freeriders. That tax would simply get priced into food. Every worker eats, and every business depends on human workers, so every company would end up paying that tax indirectly. (Of course, eliminating freeriders isn't the end of the story, as there can still be variations in the proportion of burden on each entity, and the incentives that it creates: a farming tax would place a disproportionate tax burden on fat people, and would encourage people to eat less or to use more robotics.)";3;1;False;jtoomim;ffut2nh;Bitcoin.com Update on Developer Funding;ev19sb;https://read.cash/@Bitcoin.com/update-on-developer-funding-83695ebc

BRB, converting all my assets to DASH.

But now imagine that the proposal had holders pay in the form of a ""one-time-only-never-to-be-repeated-we-promise"" increase in Bitcoin Cash's 21 million supply. And besides, it'd be ""tiny"" (a 0.07% increase would yield $6 million at current prices -- wasn't that the target raise?). ""Holders *probably* won't even notice  such a piddling effective reduction in their holdings. And anyways, they'll *probably* be more than compensated for it by the price appreciation that will flow from the improved software."" If that were the proposal, I'm guessing you'd say, ""no way! The 21 million coin limit is a fundamental part of the protocol. That's a bright red line that shouldn't be crossed."" Well, I'm suggesting that the same is true of the protocol rule that says that the coinbase reward--the *full* coinbase reward--belongs to the miner who finds it.  Or think of it this way: If I acquired 51%+ of the hash rate and began orphaning all blocks other than my own so that I collected all mining revenue, that would be an obvious 51% attack.  If I began orphaning all blocks that didn't ""give"" me some minimum *fraction* (e.g., 12.5%) of the coinbase reward, that would also be an obvious 51% attack.  If I began orphaning all blocks that didn't give *my friend* some minimum fraction of the coinbase reward, that too would be an obvious 51% attack. And, as far as I'm concerned, that remains true even if ""my friend"" is a developer (or a Hong Kong corporation) who promises to use those funds solely to fund the development of better Bitcoin Cash client software.

The notes may have different software, but the protocol rules are the same on every software. If you change a rule you are not part anymore. If everyone else changes the set of rules with you then nothing happens. Like with the hardforks on BCH every 6 month. But if not 2 seperate coins are build. Thats what happend with Ethereum and Ethereum classic for example. Even so Ethereum has much more hashrate than eth classic, it doesn't matter. For eth classic (which is the original chain btw.) Etherum is not existing because it was build on an invalid block (the one rolling back the DAO desaster).;1;1;False;meikello;ffut0am;Are shorter block times coming to BCH;ev0r9l;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/ev0r9l/are_shorter_block_times_coming_to_bch/

The fight against Satoshi will no doubt be epic, since the ultimate resolution may well be the massive centralisation of wealth into a single individuals’ hands... except for this one important reality: 

Craig has explained this fairly definitively, for those who care to listen and understand it: the Satoshi fortune belongs in trust, under the direction of trustees who are most likely incorporated. 

What that means is that Craig does not ‘own’ the contents of the trust (the Satoshi fortune) but he does, by extension, control how they’re used and spent. 

As a result, if the Satoshi fortune ends up being worth a trillion dollars fiat equivalent, we will still not really be able to call Wright ‘the first trillionaire’, although there is great competition for that title worldwide. 

Like Andrew Carnegie, Wright is destined to become a great philanthropist, and a great deal of the Satoshi fortune will be granted to universities, schools, libraries and other green plans and infrastructure plans,

"Disclaimer: I’m a BSV shill. 

First off, why the split? A few reasons: 
1. The proposal to change BCH’s ordering scheme for transactions in a block, known as ‘CTOR’ (Canonical Transaction Ordering) puts emphasis on developers changing the protocol in order to accommodate miners. The issue here is two-fold. Firstly the white paper specifically says that it’s important to put transactions into the block in the order in which they arrive. So they shouldn’t be sorted arbitrarily by the protocol itself according to size as they are in CTOR. 
This mechanism, where the first seen transaction is considered the first seen by law and is first included in a block makes the ordering consistent and dependable. If you reorder transactions you break all kinds of functionality of the protocol, like computabilty of transactions that contain functions and must refer to other transactions (for example). It’s crucial to keep the initial scheme as detailed in the white paper to keep consistency.

Secondly, the protocol can not change like this every 6 months, because it destroys what everyone else in the ecosystem is building. It really fucks up the whole economy if you keep tinkering with the protocol, and it sets a bad precedent, why? Because it makes the protocol devs responsible for fixing every problem and use-case from a centralised point of control. They can’t solve every problem, and which problems should they try to solve, and in who’s favour? So it should be up to the miners to figure out how to solve problems in the economy, with the help of app developers and builders in the ecosystem. 

That’s a response to why ‘split’ from BCH to BSV. BSV simply didn’t implement the changes that BCH did, so technically, BCH forked away from Bitcoin into something else.

An address and person will only get added onto the registry with sufficient proof the submission is from a specific unique human. Otherwise, the dispute resolution mechanism (referring the case to a Kleros decentralized court by incentivized challenges) rejects or removes the submission.

The public registration provably shows an account or action is taken by a specific person. This can serve as a universal identifier, as a claim of uniqueness for other self-sovereign identities, and in numerous use cases (including participation in a forum). 

For cases requiring such Sybil proofness but favoring privacy, one can repeatedly get a different anonymous identity, when an application allows it. It is provably by some unique human by a Traceable Ring Signature, though the initial submission was public.

A leader of this community project is Kleros.io whose [decentralized court](https://kleros.io) system incentivizes jurors to rule fairly. This kind of system was chosen by Liberland and Blue Frontiers (seasteads).

Can even use a 2 channel approach with Discord to allow all BCH users to come in the main channel and report these scam accounts while the tight-knit group helps ensure accounts/posts are scams before coordinating a takedown.

Takedown = coordinated reporting on these posts/accounts.

"Don't count your eggs before they hatch. Lightning is flawed, not because of what this article states but because of all these problems that Lightning has created which neither Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash have:

- In Bitcoin my coins can only be stolen if I leak my private key.  For LN your money can be stolen simply by not being online to monitor your money. In addition to stealing your LN private keys, a bad user can attempt to steal your funds when you're offline. Which is why LN requires a 3rd party service called Watchtowers to watch over your funds. Way more complicated than Bitcoin

- In LN when making a transactions you must always reserve the current Bitcoin on chain miner fee, so that if either channel party wants to close the channel it'll get accepted and mined by a Bitcoin miner. when Bitcoin fees hit $3 a few months ago, 60% of the Lightning network capacity was locked up in miner fees.

- Merchants have to top up their channels so they can keep accepting money. You don't have this on Bitcoin. I can have an empty address on Bitcoin and receive all the Bitcoin in the world on it. 


- With Bitcoin I can keep my money in a cold wallet. With LN it's either a hot wallet or cold wallet and I must close all my channels and pay the Bitcoin onchain fee just to close it. You're literally choosing between low fees OR security with Lightning, where as with Bitcoin you have both.

- LN requires  both parties to be online to transact. You don't have this with Bitcoin.


- The unsolvable routing problem. A good chunk of LN transactions will fail simply because the routing is weighted and changes constantly. Compare that to Bitcoin's gossip network which doesn't require any weighted routing.  Weighted routing is currently a mathematically unsolved problem.

- LN is centralizing around LNbig.com At one point LNBig.com had over 70% of the entire LN network capacity. LN will continue to centralize around these big hubs, because they can offer cheap connections and low fees than a regular peer can. Welcome to Bank of America LN Hub TM.

I'd give it another 18 months for them to fix all of the issues LN has created that Bitcoin never had. Lightning was meant to solve the high fee problem and instead created 12+ more problems and still hasn't fully solved the fee problem.";1;0;False;500239;ffu2rz0;Lightning Network Torch Has Been Stolen 4 Times Already 🤣🤣🤣;euvhqz;http://archive.ph/AkyK8

"You are mischaracterizing my position. I am not vocally against the proposal. You may be mistaking me for my brother, /u/toomim (Michael Toomim).

I've expressed my opinion [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/esqjqf/development_needs_a_financial_incentive_satoshi/ffditdk/). In brief, I think that a compulsory payment from miners to developers is probably a good thing (though I do have some concerns about the details of how this proposal is to be implemented).

Voluntary donation suffers from the [free-rider problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-rider_problem), which is often confused with the tragedy of the commons, a similar concept relating to things with negative externalities rather than positive ones. The need to solve free-rider problems and tragedies of the commons is the main reason why governments exist. The BCH community seems to be reacting very negatively to this proposal because lots of people here don't like governments and want them to not exist, or at least to not exist with BCH. I understand that sentiment, but I haven't seen any other proposed solutions to the free-rider problem except for having a small minority of philanthropic people voluntarily donate their time or money to the project -- which really is just a way of ignoring the problem and allowing a small number of people (like me) to pay more than their fair share. I think that Bitcoin can be made to mostly work that way, but I don't think that is the optimal strategy. I certainly know a lot of developers who would love to work on BCH development but can't afford to because most miners prefer not to donate their time or money to the project.

That said, while I generally support the funding scheme, I don't think that it is worth risking a community schism over. If the majority of the BCH userbase prefers to continue limping along with the current haphazard voluntary/amateur development scheme, that's fine with me.

"Linux has gotten pretty far with a combination of amateur and voluntary developers. Many of the voluntary developers are *corporate* volunteers -- that is, companies who have decided that it's worthwhile to fund full-time developers either because their businesses depend on Linux working properly or because they get ancillary benefits from having Linux expertise in-house. This has worked quite well for Linux overall.

On the other hand, when Bitcoin attempted the same strategy, we got Blockstream -- a business that decided it was worthwhile to fund full-time developers because their business depended on Bitcoin not working properly.

The key difference may be that Linux still has Linus Torvalds, and Linus is [not shy](https://youtu.be/IVpOyKCNZYw?t=101) in how he responds to companies being bad actors in Linux development.

"> It doesn't suffer from the tragedy of the commons, because if I donate, I profit regardless if others donate or not.

What you're describing is a classic example of the freerider problem. The freerider problem arises when the benefit of an action (or good) is *non-excludable*. An excludable good is one where only the people who pay for it benefit from it. But if that whale donates, then everybody benefits regardless of whether they donate. That whale would benefit more if he waits for someone else to donate instead, and freerides on their donation. And few or no whales are likely to donate, because the benefits of their donations are diluted among all other holders, leaving a very weak incentive for the whale himself. This results in far less contribution to the public good than is optimal.

Let's put this into math. A whale choosing to donate will cause a gross benefit *B* to all holders of the currency, at a cost *C* to himself. If the whale's ownership share of the currency is *S*, then the net benefit that the whale receives will be *B/S - C*. A rational whale will only engage in such an action if *B/S > C*. For a whale with a 1% ownership, that means the investment would need to bring out at least a 100x return for a rational whale to find it worthwhile. If the investment ""only"" gives a 10x return, then it just won't happen.

A better alternative is to use an [assurance contract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assurance_contract). A holder (of any size, needs not be a whale) enters into a contract with many other holders which states that if holders with at least *P* share of the total holdings donate, then s/he will also donate. If the holder has share *S* of the total holdings, then the holder will receive benefit *B/S* at a cost *C/P/S* to himself, and the net benefit will be *(B - C/P)/S*. For a group of holders comprising 50% of all holders, the investment would only need to bring out at least a 2x return for a rational group to find it worthwhile, and there is no minimum share threshold for a holder to have a motivation to join.

The proposal for miners to orphan blocks of non-contributors is a mining-specific analogue of the assurance contract in which P becomes equal to 1 as long as at least 51% of the hashrate joins the scheme voluntarily.";2;1;False;jtoomim;ffuf6k5;"BitcoinUnlimited: ""We would like to thank @jtoomim and his pool for voluntarily donating a percentage of the coinbase reward to Bitcoin Unlimited.

"Again risking to sound like a broken record.. I think voluntary donations can be improved a lot by handing out proofs of donation to the people who donated. These proofs could be in form of slp tokens that implementations give out for every donation they receive.

"For the record, I support making miner contributions to fund marketing efforts compulsory.  Spending my time, money, and effort promoting BCH adoption, as I do, is game-theoretically irrational.  For example, the future individual benefit I might hope to receive from helping a stranger at a meetup get set up with a phone wallet and funding it with a dollar or two worth of BCH is extremely attenuated.  (Heck, I remember giving strangers 0.1 BTC to get them started back in 2012 / early 2013.) 

For the record, in case the sarcasm wasn't clear, I don't *actually* support such a change.  Yes, there's a bit of a free-rider problem when it comes to bitcoin protocol development. Of course, that was true in 2009 and 2010 when Bitcoin was incredibly tiny, obscure, and essentially worthless.  The free rider problem *should* be a lot *easier* to overcome 11 years later at a time when crypto has become almost mainstream, has made many early adopters extremely wealthy, and at a time when the protocol *should* be ossifying.  As Peter Rizun put it in his recent article: 

>The bitcoin protocol is very simple and was mostly complete in 2009 (by Satoshi).  It is 11 years later and we should be moving towards a stable protocol (without block size limits) and the role of the ""protocol developer"" should be waning. Many people are passionate about bitcoin and will continue to do the work that needs doing. And as bitcoin becomes more important to businesses—because we attract more users—these business will also have an incentive to contribute.

"If you have the time, I would like to suggest a couple of things that could be done regarding the funding issue (quoting from another comment I made):

1). The first one is that there could be a BCH meetup to analize current solutions in other open-source projects, what pros and cons each has, and what results each has produced. A preliminar list would be:

- Selling additional services and support (like bitcoin.com does with the exchange etc) and directing the profits toward development.
- Selling a pro edition (not applicable.)
- When the product is too essential for a company that it compensates to donate (Netflix and Intel donating to FreeBSD.)
- Crowdfunding directed to specific proposals, like Monero does. It seems to have produced satisfactory results.
- General donations (wallets that have an opt-out donation.)
- Protocol-layer funding (Zcash, DASH.) This is where the current proposal sits, and a thorough inspection of the outcomes in other chains is in my opinion warranted.

2). The second point is that I believe that the most free-market solution is crowdfunding directed to proposals: In crowdfunding there's a direct exchange of value for value, and this creates competition amongst ideas and developers. Crowdfunding directed to specific proposals makes users feel more involved and enthusiastic, because they are donating to something more concrete rather than general/abstract (the node implementation as a whole) and are also voting with their money how to shape the project.

There's another interesting aspect in crowdfunding: If a simple p2p crowdfunding interface is developed, it can be embedded in any open-source project, not only BCH wallets and products. The app could notify the user once a proposal they like/funded reaches its goal, and also once it is completed. This gives satisfaction to the donor and it's more likely they will donate again, with better results than with traditional crowdfunding models. Something like this could onboard other projects to start accepting BCH, if it is truly useful.

More involved software bounties could also be implemented, creating contracts with blind escrows. This could enable a new ecosystem of open-source developers earning crypto for their work.

Crowdfunding combined with selling services and opt-out donations is in my opinion the first step toward a solution. If after taking this to its maximum expression there are still not enough funds, then a protocol-layer approach could be suggested, but not before.";0;0;False;user01110;fft7n0o;"BitcoinUnlimited: ""We would like to thank @jtoomim and his pool for voluntarily donating a percentage of the coinbase reward to Bitcoin Unlimited.

">Linux has gotten pretty far with a combination of amateur and voluntary developers.

That's a great point, and I agree. Debian alone, as far as my experience with Linux goes (6+ years), has been a bastion and stronghold for free(dom) software (although they do offer the `non-free` repo), with large contributions to the codebase coming voluntarily, and frequently. There's no doubt the Linux model of software funding and development works.

The difference between the Blockstream takeover and this proposal is that it is initiated by the miners and ultimately enforced by incentives, so long as the proposal doesn't completely alter the incentives (which I don't believe this one does, from a Nakamoto Consensus standpoint, but please correct me if I'm wrong). This proposal, in my opinion, seems more analogous to your Linux example (i.e. miners [companies] hiring devs to make their product better), than it does your Blockstream example (i.e. company w/ a product hiring devs of a different product to make the company's product better)";4;0;False;maff1989;ffspdu6;"BitcoinUnlimited: ""We would like to thank @jtoomim and his pool for voluntarily donating a percentage of the coinbase reward to Bitcoin Unlimited.

"> I can't wrap my head around the cognitive dissonance required for someone to in one breath argue that it's okay for miners to intentionally orphan other miners who don't pay into their tax scheme as a product of their free choice to decide what mining work they do but in the next breath say its not okay for users to run software that rejects those orphaning miner's blocks as a product of their own free choice to decide what software they run. 

They take a position that is essentially ""might makes right"" and describing it as libertarian philosophy. The real action to consider in all of this is the choice of software that a person runs, not simply ""investing"" in hash. Everyone has a right to validate for themselves whether their preferred rules are being followed, and we should strive to open up this possibility to as many people on the planet as possible while keeping the network stable and useful. 

This whole episode also makes clear the political dangers of hard forks. Personally, I don't believe there are serious ethical issues with conducting hard forks, but there are very serious technical and political issues with executing them successfully. Here, we see that scheduled hard forks produce a relatively easy way to let powerful people make their preferred changes to the protocol (and look at how many people are okay with it only because it would be instituted at the same time as a hard fork). This is vastly easier on a minority hash coin with a DAA that adjusts downwards rapidly. I suppose we'll see how it all goes down in May, but even the threat of it should wake some people up here to the dangers of centralized mining, miner worship, and - most fundamentally - trust that someone else ought to be in charge of the rules.";0;0;False;iwantfreebitcoin;ffs2huv;I stand with Freetrader opposition to a hashpower attack fuelled tax scheme on Bcash.;eutnpn;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/eutnpn/i_stand_with_freetrader_opposition_to_a_hashpower/

"Good job putting together your altogether sane and rational arguments against the proposal. As the days wind by, I believe more and more that this proposal is actually about something completely different than funding devs. It's about getting rid of attack miners from BSV and BTC.  Anybody big in crypto can raise $6 mil at the drop of a hat. Venture capitalists regularly throw $100 mil at a poorly-specced crypto project. No, this proposal is to penalize the DAA gamers and BCH dumpers. The BSV price pump has somehow been sustained (with massive losses, I am sure) and BSV is actually drawing over SHA256 miners from BCH this month. BCH mining is under constant pressure and [BTC.top](https://BTC.top) must be losing money supporting it. That's why I believe so many opinion leaders in the space embraced what by its face looks like a horrible idea.

Nobody can talk about this for fear of getting sued by Craig. This man files lawsuits more often than most people change their socks. BSV is sponsored by state actors and I believe strongly that the BSV price pump is their latest attack vector.

The HK company is in reality a join-venture and cannot become a problem because the miners could always just stop or reroute payment to another company.

Then all those people opposing the fund because it is a tax. As if they are concerned about miners out of empathy.. Miners long term business model was broken by Blockstream and then they were forced to watch 95% of their hardware mine for a chain which users and devs are openly hostile to them for 2 years+. Not even talking about the DAA gaming on their favorite chain they are forced to watch daily. Ridiculous.

Good job Colin, this seems like common sense to me as well. I'm starting to believe that the proposal authors are not trying to fund devs, they're actually trying to punish BSV and BTC switch miners and DAA gaming miners. With a higher percentage of BCH coinbase rewards firmly in their hands, the [btc.top](https://btc.top) and other cartel miners can artificially pump the BCH price higher. The last 24 hours of BCH upside might even be a signal of such. BSV is sustaining their ridiculous price pump (with huge losses I'm sure, they seem to have infinite money to burn), so this proposal is likely designed to take them out. I'm guessing that BSV miners switch to BCH, game the DAA, grab some coinbase coins, and dump them ASAP, keeping BCH price down. If they're fined 12.5%, it will disincentivize them.

They don't care if the network has integrity or not, only that the markets hold up long enough for them to extract as many bags as possible. There will be diminishing returns and they'll never get all their bags out, but they will profit greatly.

">Because they can. 

Well, obviously a majority of the hash rate “can” 51% attack the network, or, stated less provocatively, push through a very misguided “soft fork.” But for now at least, it remains an open question as to whether or not they *will* do so. Also unclear, to me at least, is what fraction of support is coming from intentionally malicious actors attempting to undermine the chain and what fraction is coming from well-meaning “useful idiots” (for lack of a better phrase).  

>This is them exiting, leaving you behind.

Ha, I suppose you *could* look at it that way, although I think it’s pretty strained. A majority hash rate soft fork of this kind is more like the driver of a bus beginning to head in a radically new direction, forcing those who don’t want to go to the new destination to exit (i.e., by organizing their own minority counter-fork)

>Yeah, just they don't matter to the people making these plays. They've already factored in reactions and determined that there is no risk presented by anyone.

Maybe. There’s obviously no shortage of fuckery in this space or we wouldn’t be here. So this certainly *could* be a coordinated attack on BCH that’s attempting to undermine the chain’s integrity by catalyzing another network-effect-destroying split, establishing a dangerous precedent, centralizing control of the chain’s future development in the hands of an entity that has been (or could be) captured.  But I think at *least* some of its initial support is coming from genuinely well-intentioned people who thought it was a way to “solve the development funding issue” in a way that “eliminates the problem of free riding” and better yet, will be “subsidized by BTC-supporting miners.”

OK. I don't' see how your assertion that ""investors"", other than those investors that secure the chain, build the chain, and extend the chain have any significant power. Get your nakamoto concensus on or remain less important that those that get their nakamoto consensus on.

> No, I'd characterize a 51% attack as a failure of the consensus system. 

You say potato I say potato. 51% is nakamoto consensus. 

I find it odd that you, and others, that support BCH, which only has... what? 3% SHAH256 nakamotomo consensus are also against nakamoto consensus or define nakamoto consensus in a manner that is not nakamoto concensus.

> A ""51% attack"" is just a label for a malicious soft fork.

Ohh.. it's a lot more than that. It's you defining anything you do not agree with that MAY not be supported by an overwhelming, yet undefined, amount of nakamoto consensus.

How about you define what % of nakamoto consensus you deem acceptable for ANY proposal. Then, once you've defined that %, get nakamoto consensus to back up your definition of nakamoto consensus.

>  The classic example (i.e., the one outlined in the whitepaper) is a ""dishonest"" hash rate majority using their hash rate to deliberately and fraudulently double-spend a confirmed transaction.

Yes yes... the classic example of the majority determining what is acceptable and the minority screaming at the wall ""THAT""S NOT FAIR, WE ALL HAVE TO AGREE!""

How much ""we all have to agree"" until it is an acceptable amount for you? COme on, give me a percentage. Is is 52%? 53% 75%, 97%.

I find it ridiculous that someone who supports BCH, a 3% minority chain, also throws around ""51% attack"". I understand it... I still find it ridiculous. Fuck... you, and I,  support a chain that used a 3% attack.

> Um, thanks? I'd note your opinion too, but I'm having a little trouble extracting it from that. Ok if I just put you down as ""still considering""?

"> No change should be the default, anyway.

I agree that no change should be the default.  I would like to avoid a split if at all possible.  

There are technical issues that give Bitcoin ABC a lot of power to dictate changes to the protocol.  Bitcoin ABC nodes have a ""poison pill"" aka ""automatic replay protection"" that will fork themselves off the network on May 15th.  And so exchanges and miners that currently run ABC need to upgrade before May 15th regardless of the tax.  If the tax plan goes through, ABC will then bundle the tax as part of the upgrade, so that by default the tax becomes a new part of the ""upgraded"" protocol.

An outsider might think ""well everyone should reject the tax by refusing to upgrade.""  However, that is made nearly impossible by the poison pill.  If everyone does NOTHING then the ABC nodes will end up on a different network than all the light clients.

The old EDA would adjust diff down 20% on (I think) a rolling average.. I don't remember the finer detail as to the timing of the emergency diff drop. However, I remember that the diff would drop 20% for a few consecutive blocks, then miners would flock over to mine BCH with the increased profitability. Since the EDA would only adjust down, and the regular 2016 block diff adjustment was still in place, a vast majority of those 2016 blocks would come and go incredibly fast (like, ""1 block per minute"" fast).

"BCH must expect to be attacked from now until forever. We have to ignore that noise and think for ourselves.

I predict BCH will never recover from this scheme in the long term. It is even possible that it will die a fiery death in the short term. Imagine there are a vast majority of hardware miners out there who don't care at all about BCH. They get 97% of their profit from BTC. Then imagine BCH offloading this 12.5% scheme by taking a slice of that 97% of profit AND introducing uncertainty into their forecasts about already thin margins. Now you can imagine that this majority of miners that was formerly neutral has been pushed into an anti-BCH stance. How do you think that is going to turn out? Forget about semantic arguments over whether this is a tax or not.

I'm going to disagree with this characterization and conclusion here. Maintaining a codebase as large and as complex as ABC is full time job for at minimum six developers, preferably more IMO.

This includes bug triage and fixing, backporting, refactoring, paying down tech debt, optimizations, code review and documentation.

">The way I see it, is that because hash rate will go down, it will be mostly electricity companies paying for it by selling less electricity to miners. In return the network will be slightly less secure because of the lower hash rate.

Right now, holders ""pay"" for inflation and in exchange they get a certain amount of hash rate security that depends on coin price (and to a much lesser extent, transaction volume and fees). This proposal would result in holders getting less hash rate / security for a given coin price because some fraction of the coinbase reward that had been incentivizing hash rate / security would instead be diverted to the Hong Kong company.  So I think holders would be the ones ""paying."" Electric companies might be *affected* by the resulting reduction in demand for their product, but I think it'd be odd to say they're the ones ""paying"" for the proposal. It's like you've got a club that budgets $1000 a month for refreshments and they decide to switch from spending all $1000 on beer and start spending some of it (e.g., $125) on sodas. Would you say that the beer companies are the ones ""paying"" for the soda? SHA256 miners are kind of in the position of beer companies in my analogy -- although they're also the ones capable of voting on the proposal to divert some funds to soda.  And actually, maybe to make the analogy better, we should replace ""soda"" with ""funding for scientific research to improve beer brewing technology."" Club members still get less beer in the short term although supporters of the proposal might argue that they'll get more beer in the long-term if the research leads to technological breakthroughs in brewing technology that reduce the cost of manufacture. And maybe they'll also get more beer in the short term because the club members in this analogy are actually all stakeholders in the beer company and the successful adoption of the proposal will immediately raise market confidence in the beer company's long-term prospects, increasing the value of the members' stock, and giving them the ability to afford more beer immediately.";2;1;False;Capt_Roger_Murdock;ffuf2e8;The Best Of Intentions: The Dev Tax Is Intended to Benefit Investors But Will Corrupt Us Instead;euck8t;https://read.cash/@PeterRizun/the-best-of-intentions-the-dev-tax-is-intended-to-benefit-investors-but-will-corrupt-us-instead-012f5dbd

"No... the core issue is that a Hong Kong company isn't the right vehicle to redistribute wealth to developers.

There aren't clear milestones set for BCH development that the developers must accomplish to be compensated, and there aren't clear rules or accountability for this HK company or who gets compensated for what.

The entire thing smells like a huge power grab, and will cause more forks in the community. I sure as hell am not going to back a chain with a 12.5% tax built in that goes to a legally incorporated entity that's subject to regulation. That's about as anti-cryptocurrency as I can imagine.

"I have two thoughts, on quite different aspects.

First, this proposal, along with the original dev proposal, makes the assumption that we need to force miners to donate, to solve the free-rider problem. I'm not convinced of this. *I haven't seen a strong fundraising push. Nobody has asked me for donations, for instance. I don't see ads on r/btc asking for donations.* I think it is overkill, overly-complex or hard-handed approaches to get people to donate, when we simply haven't tried regular fundraising where we send lots of emails and post advertisements asking people to donate. The crypto-community tends to over-engineer technical solutions to social problems that could be addressed with simple social mechanisms, and I'm skeptical that this level of incentive engineering is necessary.

However, if we do buy into the premise that some type of forced donation is necessary, then I think this proposal is going in a good direction by allowing miners to choose where their funds go (similar to jtoomim's proposal) and averaging the list over time. I'd also suggest that miners could vote on the required donation amount over time. They could decrease it from 12.5% to 3%, or increase it to 20%. Or remove it altogether at 0%.

Fundraising is usually a social problem. It involved knocking on doors, creating social bonds, and getting a group together for a common mission for the greater good. When people see others donate, who ask them to donate, they are more likely to donate. This is why fundraisers typically show a thermometer with a goal amount, so the group can see that they are acting together to reach a goal. If you need something more technical, the free-loader problem can be solved with a pledge+release mechanism like in Kickstarter or [Mike Hearn's Lighthouse](https://github.com/bitcoinj-cash/lighthouse), where a project is only funded once it reaches its threshold. But the core of fundraising is the social work of community-building— talking to a wide range of people, building a network of passionate believers, incorporating the public's values into a shared mission statement, finding measurable goals that further that mission, and then asking for people to make financial commitments towards those goals.

This is the type of social work that's been entirely missing so far. The original 12.5% tax proposal was sprung on the public as if it's already been decided. That's a really bad smell. That's relying on authority rather than building a real movement.";1;1;False;toomim;ffs31gs;Removing centralisation from the dev funding proposal;etxshd;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/etxshd/removing_centralisation_from_the_dev_funding/
