"Bitcoin transactions have become radically more efficient.  A couple years ago using coinbase would involve four transactions each featuring two inputs and outputs on average for every user payment (sweeping funds to and from a user address on deposit and spend).  Today, instead one transaction has a bunch of outputs. That's a 4-16x increase in efficiency.  Improvements like that have happened all over the bitcoin ecosystem.  Meanwhile, in some alternatives, most of the ""transactions"" are totally uneconomic forum posts or weather data.";1;2;False;nullc;ffrk227;I stand with Freetrader opposition to a hashpower attack fuelled tax scheme on Bcash.;eutnpn;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/eutnpn/i_stand_with_freetrader_opposition_to_a_hashpower/
"Something has to pay for security and it doesn't come cheap-- because a dishonest party that outspends the honest ones will be successful.  For many, Bitcoin's headline feature is that it is inflation free (after all, inflation is just a tax under another name...) and so that means fees are a fact of life.  This has been known since day one.

It's annoying, I agree-- which is why lots of people have been investing less costly ways to transact with bitcoin suitable for frequent and low value payments.

Look at how many prominent voices in the BCH community have been responding to the challenge of paying for  software maintenance and development:  They're desperately trying to get someone else to pay for it. (Even when already, a large amount-- probably a significant majority-- of the maintenance in BCH is being paid for by Bitcoiners by virtue of BCH software copying changes from Bitcoin).  As BCH's hashrate slides to nothing what do you think is going to be done to pay for security with the hard stance against fees?

Low fees are great, but they're worthless if all they let you transact is an insecure asset.";5;1;False;nullc;ffrj14g;I stand with Freetrader opposition to a hashpower attack fuelled tax scheme on Bcash.;eutnpn;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/eutnpn/i_stand_with_freetrader_opposition_to_a_hashpower/

"I am not a developer and the proposal is based on sound game logic. The attacks on the proposal has been more emotional rather than logical which is why atackers have been handwaving all attempts at discussion for whether or not it is a tax. Also, it is not a centralized shady company that is in control it is the 5 signed mining companies which people can liken to a joint-venture. This proposal is very much in line with Anarchocapitalist ideals and Roger signing it (not just chinese miners) further adds to this sentiment. I do not think miners should bow down to emotive attacks when their reasoning is solid and in line with the prescribed ideals of BCH. I believe BCH will push through to create peer-to-peer cash. Once BCH becomes the majority chain I do not think that an IFP with 12.5% could be unilaterally pushed by a coalition of miners. But BCH is a minority chain and minority chains need to trust in the ideological miners who have sacrificed profit to keep this network running.

>One criticism of cartels is that they collude with one another. Murray Rothbard criticizes these terms for being emotive. What is really occurring is cooperation. For what is the essence of a cartel action? Individual producers agree to pool their assets into a common lot, this single central organization to make the decisions on production and price policies for all the owners and then to allocate the monetary gain among them.

Every block, new coins are added into the supply. This makes the rest become a tad less valuable. Block rewards are a temporary kickstarter mechanism implemented by Satoshi to allow the Bitcoin network to have a decent hashrate while it doesn't yet have enough TXs to fund it naturally via TX fees.

Miners are not affected by this 12.5% reduction. Because it simply means the hashrate on BCH will go down by 12.5%. The total block reward on the SHA256 coins would only go down around 0.4%.

Even if the BCH miners that propose this scheme do not hop between SHA256 coins, others will. So basically 0.4% of all Bitcoin miners will be squeezed out of the network.

There's no reason why you couldn't take ABC or BU, make a bunch of local modifications to it, without releasing them, and profit off it that way.

However, those developers would then also be able to spend partial time on public nodes that are ran by exchanges and such.

" >It's miner's choice to do this, distributing their own money!

Of course, miners are free to spend their own money however they like.  The problem is that they're proposing to dictate, via intentional orphaning / a protocol rule change, how other miners spend their money.  

>If someone doesn't like it, don't mine it, or start another project.

Exit is always an option, but so is (at least for now) voice, which OP is exercising.  And don't forget that exit, when it becomes necessary, often comes with a high price.  After all, BCH exists because lots of people didn't like the intentional crippling of Bitcoin's transactional capacity / the radical subversion of the project's original design and goals.  But creating BCH as a rebranded minority hash-rate ""spinoff"" meant sacrificing a huge chunk of its network effect, as reflected by its still substantially lower price and transaction volume.

>This does not concern any other group.

What an absurd suggestion.  Of course all BCH holders have an interest in the properties of the chain.  In addition to the dangerous precedent that would be set if this proposal were implemented, this proposal would result in the diversion of some of the coinbase reward away from incentivizing hash rate / chain security and towards one particular Hong Kong company.

Think of this way. If I acquired 51%+ of the hash rate and began orphaning all blocks other than my own so that I collected all mining revenue, that would be an obvious 51% attack.  If I began orphaning all blocks that didn't ""give"" me some minimum *fraction* (e.g., 12.5%) of the coinbase reward, that would also be an obvious 51% attack.  If I began orphaning all blocks that didn't give *my friend* some minimum fraction of the coinbase reward, that too would be an obvious 51% attack. And, as far as I'm concerned, that remains true even if ""my friend"" is a developer (or a Hong Kong corporation) who promises to use those funds solely to fund the development of better Bitcoin Cash client software.";6;2;False;Capt_Roger_Murdock;ffrkalq;The community deserves a formal withdraw of the proposed changes by the signatories.

No, not really :) read.cash is a side-project for fun, we do have full-time jobs.

> When the demand for your server resources will grow, the plan to monetize will be to sell ads

No, no plans for ads. Adtech makes us feel nauseous. We don't even have Google Analytics installed. Luckily the servers are cheap nowadays, we'll just optimize it. Frankly it's mostly static content with a few small active things, nothing that can't be well optimized. We work on sites that receive millions of views per day, so that doesn't worry us.

> allow paywalls competing with satoshiwall.cash or both?

Most of our plans are here: https://read.cash/@Read.Cash/readcash-roadmap-9c51de71 in no particular order (the link is in the footer of every page).

Paywalls currently are on pause, since 1) satoshiwall does them **really** well and it doesn't make sense to compete - you can just write an article on read.cash and put a link to satoshiwall 2) they change the site dynamic greatly: right now you have to write something really interesting to get a tip, but with paywalls you'd have to hype something really well...

> Are u looking at using IPFS or any other decentralized storage solution at some point?

Kind of. You can already [take out all your articles](https://read.cash/@Read.Cash/download-your-articles-and-self-host-1bee3647) at any moment, btw. 

IPFS: we looked at it, but it seems that it would be only mirrored by our own node. Other nodes might mirror something, but mostly nothing. There's no forced mirroring in IPFS. If our site is taken down - IPFS node will come with it and mostly nothing will be left. 

There are a few things under consideration to make site more decentralized, but there are no immediate plans. At some point - probably yes, we'll move some parts (like articles and comments storage) to be more decentralized, but decentralization is hard. It's not like we're happy growing some walled garden, but again - we have unrelated full-time jobs, so we're mostly only doing what we really know well how to do and things that we can do fast in some spare time. Nobody among us has extended experience with decentralized stuff (outside of BCH). Enterprise programmers don't usually need decentralized stuff :)

"Thank you for your response, I appreciate it. It may seem like I am pro the original BTC-Top(?) proposal, I am not, for many reasons. I am, to the extent I am able, providing a ""devil's advocate"" against everyone. I won't necessarily agree with anything you say above/below, because my intent is not to come to agreement, but to challenge. I know that does not always go over well.

I kind of started my reply half way through your comment and then had to go back and fill in, so I may not follow your comment perfectly.
_____

> From what I can see, and I might not be seeing enough, the miner proposal is being opposed by most Bitcoin Cash users,

There is no conceivable way for you to know that this statement is true. This is projection(?). You have not taken a poll on all the users and even if you did who would trust the poll?

What you are seeing are vocal opposition to the proposal. It may, or may not, actually be ""most Bitcoin Cash users"". Hell, from my understanding the Chinese user have been reported to support the proposal, but I take that with a truckload of salt (sinophobia and my understanding that the Chinese are more accepting of authoritarianism(?)).

> **or at least** most of those who are active on this subreddit and **most of the people whose opinions I follow and respect.** 

How about we leave it at that, since that is more accurate?

> And if you're suggesting that it's only the opinions of miners who matter, you're mistaken.

Well... kind of... and no, I am not mistaken. We're probably going to disagree, and just because I am making the following statements does not mean I 100% support my own statements (ya, I know.. WTF, right??)

First there is an assumption that an opinion not backed by SHA256 hash has any valid weight in Bitcoin. Nakamoto Consensus, as far as I understand it, that originated from the 1CPU = 1 Vote, has morphed more into 1 Hash = 1 vote. I won't quote the whitepaper, we both know it.

The proposers of this BTC.TOP(and 3 others pools) dev fund purport to be miners (whether pools are miners is a completely separate conversation) that control a significant (for values of significant) amount of SHA256 hash that they are willing to throw their hash behind (whether it comes to fruition is another conversation). Those that oppose the proposal can do so by: 

* throwing their own SHA256 hash into an opposing cartel, orphaning the blocks of the pro-dev cartel. That is Nakamoto Consensus

* Direct their hash to a chain that more aligns with their hash's beliefs. THat is also Nakamoto Consensus 

Those of us that do not mine can have opinions and have the freedom to exit at anytime, just as any SHA256 miner has the freedom to direct their hash at any chain they wish to support through the use of their Nakamoto Consensus. Those of us that do not mine are not participants in Nakamoto Consensus. IMO, anyone conflating their opinion, as a user or even dev, that does not participate in Nakamoto Consensus is, to some extent, merely screaming into a wall.

That's not to say our (users/devs) opinion are not valuable, just less so. I understand that this position will be frowned upon, since many/most people believe that their opinion matters, even when they do not.

> **Miners are one hugely-important category of investors.** They act as a first-line proxy for all investors as a class by deploying their hash rate to create one or more candidate chains, but it's investors more broadly who must ultimately give value to those chains and thereby provide the continuing incentive for the deployment of that hash rate.

**Saying this, IMO, is an attempt to minimize their importance,** to bolster your own importance as a user or a dev, or both. Miners are the group that secure the chain, mine the chain, and extend the chain. All other groups of ""investors"" are rent seekers, IMO (I could be using the wrong term, oh well), benefiting on the work performed every second by the miners.

Yes, the miners need ""investors"" to purchase their product, the mined tokens to give them value, but without their constant, every second contribution, the experiment fails. Because of that investment, they ultimately decide what the rules are, Nakamoto Consensus. Users, IMO, are not making a decision every second

> If you're simply pointing out that a majority of the hash rate could force this change through, you're correct... But so what?

There is no ""So what?"" We are in agreement. 51% of hash directed at the BCH chain can impose their will, until such time as they are opposed by more hash: Nakamoto Consensus.

> Yes, obviously a hash rate majority could 51% attack the network. 

That is Nakamoto Consensus.

> That doesn't mean it's something we should support!

If that is what you believe, then do not support it. Express your opinion. But understand that ultimately your opinion is not Nakamoto Consensus.

> And that's really what we're talking about here. As I wrote earlier:

Understood. Youa re not talking about Nakamoto Consensus, you are talking about your personal opinion which has exactly as much Nakamoto Consensus as you direct at the BCH chain. Curious... how much Nakamoto Consensus are you directing at the BCH chain? Me = 0, zilch, none.


> If I acquired 51%+ of the hash rate and began orphaning all blocks other than my own so that I collected all mining revenue, that would be an obvious 51% attack.

That would be Nakamoto Consensus. 

I have always found the term ""51% attack"" a bit disingenuous. It is used by just about anyone/everyone that does not agree with Nakamoto Consensus. You do agree with Nakamoto Consensus, right?

>  If I began orphaning all blocks that didn't ""give"" me some minimum fraction (e.g., 12.5%) of the coinbase reward, that would also be an obvious 51% attack.

That would also be Nakamoto Consensus. 

If I were your opponent, as a miner, I would return the favor, orphaning your blocks. We're not in this together, we're opponents. All miners are opponents **and** collaborators. Pools are cartels (kind of funny that no one, that I know of, has pointed this simple fact out by now). Groups of pools are cartels.

> If I began orphaning all blocks that didn't give my friend some minimum fraction of the coinbase reward, that too would be an obvious 51% attack.

That is Nakamoto Consensus.

If I were your opponent, as a miner, I would return the favor, orphaning your blocks. We're not in this together, we're opponents. All miners are opponents **and** collaborators.

> And, as far as I'm concerned, that remains true even if ""my friend"" is a developer (or a Hong Kong corporation) who promises to use those funds solely to fund the development of better Bitcoin Cash client software.

Great! Your opinion is noted. I may, or may not, agree with your opinion to some small or greater extent.

> No idea. Hopefully even those who initially proposed and supported this are starting to realize how fucked it is. 

Well,thanks to /u/bagatell_ [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/eumslx/we_are_a_group_of_miners_opposing_the_btctop/), there is at least a proclamation that asserts that they are miners opposing the BTC.TOP (plus 3 more pools) proposal. I am taking the proclamation with a truckload of salt due to:

* The entity that proclaimed is a brand new account representing a pool (a cartel in and of itself)

* Has not provided (may have since I read the proclamation) proof of their control of any amount of hash.

* Is (may have since I read the proclamation) completely anonymous.
































> Not exactly. Anyone can ""split the chain"" at any time.

Yes, exactly, because to split the chain one must provide some amount of the hash. No hash, no chain

> You could ""split the chain"" by coding up a minority spinoff and then starting to solo mine it on your laptop (although you'd probably want to include a pretty dramatic difficulty reset as part of such a fork).

Yes, which is providing the hash. Without the hash you merely have software. We both know this.

> It's just that in that scenario, no one is likely to care about your branch. 

I agree.

> The point is that making a protocol change as a (hash-rate-majority-supported) ""soft fork"" doesn't mean that it won't result in a split.

Of course. Nothing you or I (assuming you and I do not hash) would change that. Nakamoto Consensus controls that eventuality.

>  It just increases the coordination cost of those who don't wish to be swept along with the controversial rule change by forcing them to coordinate their own counter-fork.

Yep. So why did BCH fork off from BlockstreamCoin? Oh ya... the group that provided Nakamoto Consensus, by accepting a change in the rule set, decided to do so. I thank them for doing that, don't you?

> I'd say another significant chain split is about the last thing BCH needs at this time.

OK. Or it is exactly what it needs. By use of Nakamoto Consensus those miners that support BCH will show their support by donating 12.5% of their mining reward.

Or by Nakamoto Consensus those that support BCH will show that they will not donate 12.5% of the minding reward.

Or.. a third option that is also Nakamoto Consensus.

> **Yeah, that doesn't seem like the word you're looking for** -- although it would arguably apply to the developers seeking to change the consensus protocol to give themselves a hard-coded paycheck.

Thank you. I don't know the correct word to use, and honestly there probably needs to be a new word created for many of the things that we argue/debate about in relation to cryptocurrencies.

"> an attack on the chain will cost less.

12.5% less, which has already been noted.

The price of BCH relative to the major SHA-256 coin (BTC) has gone up much more than 12.5% in the past month. Hell, today alone BCH/BTC is up 17.5%. So BCH is already 17.5% more secure just from today's price action.

Surely 12.5% isn't a big ask when the price is so volatile.

December 14, 2018 the BCH/BTC price was 0.02352, today it's high was 0.043, almost double. (It reached 0.0451 10 days ago, and has been as low as 0.036 since then, a 20% drop from that recent high, now up 20% from that low.)

"> From what I can see, and I might not be seeing enough, the miner proposa, Nakamoto Consensus, is being opposed by developers/dev groups, specifically BU. Opposed by trolls also, but that is to be expected. Opposed by other that may/may not participaite in Nakamoto Consensus. BU, as far as I know, do not control significant SHA256 hash, therefore their opposition, while laudable, is not Nakamoto Consensus.

From what I can see, and I might not be seeing enough, the miner proposal is being opposed by most Bitcoin Cash users, or at least most of those who are active on this subreddit and most of the people whose opinions I follow and respect.  And if you're suggesting that it's only the opinions of miners who matter, you're mistaken.  Miners are one hugely-important category of investors.  They act as a first-line proxy for all investors as a class by deploying their hash rate to create one or more candidate chains, but it's investors more broadly who must ultimately give value to those chains and thereby provide the continuing incentive for the deployment of that hash rate. Miners are thus incentivized to (and ultimately must) ""follow the market,"" which includes attempting to anticipate what chain (or chains) with what features investors will value most highly.  

If you're simply pointing out that a majority of the hash rate *could* force this change through, you're correct... But so what? Yes, obviously a hash rate majority *could* 51% attack the network. That doesn't mean it's something we should support! And that's really what we're talking about here. As I wrote earlier:

 If I acquired 51%+ of the hash rate and began orphaning all blocks other than my own so that I collected all mining revenue, that would be an obvious 51% attack.  If I began orphaning all blocks that didn't ""give"" me some minimum fraction (e.g., 12.5%) of the coinbase reward, that would also be an obvious 51% attack.  If I began orphaning all blocks that didn't give *my friend* some minimum fraction of the coinbase reward, that too would be an obvious 51% attack. And, as far as I'm concerned, that remains true even if ""my friend"" is a developer (or a Hong Kong corporation) who promises to use those funds solely to fund the development of better Bitcoin Cash client software.

>Has there been any major SHA256 hash that has come out against the proposal? 

No idea. Hopefully even those who initially proposed and supported this are starting to realize how fucked it is.  

>Also, there is only one group that can split the chain, and that is the group that HAS skin in the game, the SHA256 miners. 

Not exactly. Anyone can ""split the chain"" at any time. You could ""split the chain"" by coding up a minority spinoff and then starting to solo mine it on your laptop (although you'd probably want to include a pretty dramatic difficulty reset as part of such a fork). It's just that in that scenario, no one is likely to care about your branch.  

The point is that making a protocol change as a (hash-rate-majority-supported) ""soft fork"" doesn't mean that it won't result in a split.  It just increases the coordination cost of those who don't wish to be swept along with the controversial rule change by forcing them to coordinate their own counter-fork. That's essentially what happened with the controversial-but-majority-hash-rate-supported SegWit soft fork and the creation of BCH (although in that case, the hash rate majority's continued failure to coordinate a long-overdue ""hard fork"" to increase the block size limit was also a catalyst for the split).  I'd say another significant chain split is about the last thing BCH needs at this time.

> Every act of original appropriation improves the welfare of the appropriator (at least ex ante); otherwise, it would not be performed. At the same time, no one is made worse off by this act. Any other individual could have appropriated the same goods and territories if only he had recognized them as scarce, and hence, valuable. However, since no other individual made such an appropriation, no one else can have suffered a welfare loss on account of the original appropriation. Hence, the so-called Pareto-criterion (that it is scientifically legitimate to speak of an improvement of ""social welfare"" only if a particular change increases the individual welfare of at least one person and leaves no one else worse off) is fulfilled. An act of original appropriation meets this requirement. It enhances the welfare of one person, the appropriator, without diminishing anyone else’s physical wealth (property). **Everyone else has the same quantity of property as before and the appropriator has gained new,  previously non-existent property.** In so far, an act of original appropriation always increases social welfare.

I disagree with the bolded text. Original appropriation removes the property from the commons: which are in turn borrowed from future generations. While the the text points out that future users (latecommers) can not advocate for themselves: it  is up to the people living in the present to act as stewards for the land

The document goes on to explain why they feel only private ownership encourages stewardship:

> In contrast to the communist utopia of Plato's Republic, Aristotle provides a comprehensive list of the comparative advantages of private property in Politics. First, private property is more productive. ""What is common to the greatest number gets the least amount of care. Men pay most attention to what is their own; they care less for what is common; or at any rate they care for it only to the extent to which each is individually concerned. Even when there is no other cause for inattention, men are more prone to neglect their duty when they think that another is attending to it.""7

However, the first quote appears to advocate acquiring land on speculation: taking it out of common use. There seems to be an implied assumption that wild land is necessarily unproductive.

Sure, it's impressionistic.

Sorry, but no, I don't see how you've effectively challenged my conclusion that the ultimate power is held by all investors.  

>There is no ""So what?"" We are in agreement. 51% of hash directed at the BCH chain can impose their will, until such time as they are opposed by more hash: Nakamoto Consensus.
>...
>That [i.e., a 51% attack] is Nakamoto Consensus.

No, I'd characterize a 51% attack as a *failure* of the consensus system.  

>I have always found the term ""51% attack"" a bit disingenuous. 

A ""51% attack"" is just a label for a malicious soft fork.  The classic example (i.e., the one outlined in the whitepaper) is a ""dishonest"" hash rate majority using their hash rate to deliberately and fraudulently double-spend a confirmed transaction. This is equivalent to a soft fork that begins to apply the following rule: ""*actually* transaction B came before competing A (despite this not being true) so I'm going to treat any block containing transaction A as invalid.""  Of course, not all soft forks are malicious. You can imagine a spectrum of soft forks with 100% benign and non-controversial ones at one end, and obviously-malicious ones at the other. 

>It is used by just about anyone/everyone that does not agree with Nakamoto Consensus. You do agree with Nakamoto Consensus, right?

The whole idea behind Bitcoin is using PoW to allow network participants to reach consensus on transaction ordering (i.e., solve the ""double-spend problem"") in a distributed manner (i.e., without the need for a trusted central authority).  The idea was that the chain with the most PoW would be a sufficiently *clear* Schelling point regarding ledger state for network participants to converge on, as well as a sufficiently *""honest""* / reliable one.  Do I ""agree"" with the idea? It's certainly an experiment worth trying. That's why I'm here. But the PoW mechanism has obviously shown that it's not infalliable. Other PoW chains have already been ""51% attacked"" in the fairly unambiguous fraudulent-double-spend-enabling sense of the term.  And the fact that BCH exists as a minority chain represents an at least partial failure of Bitcoin's fundamental security assumption, i.e., that a majority of the hash rate would be incentivized to protect the integrity of the network. The BTC chain is the ongoing victim of what is, in effect, a 51% attack in the form of what I've previously called a [""nearly-empty block attack.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/beypf7/interview_with_peter_rizuns_critiquing_the/elgurdq/)  Will the invention behind Bitcoin succeed, or I suppose rather, will it be as successful as I hope it can be by ""taking over the world""? We'll see, although the past few years have made me *less* optimistic about its chances.  

>Great! Your opinion is noted. I may, or may not, agree with your opinion to some small or greater extent.

Um, thanks? I'd note your opinion too, but I'm having a little trouble extracting it from that. Ok if I just put you down as ""still considering""?

>Yes, exactly, because to split the chain one must provide some amount of the hash. No hash, no chain.

An amount that can be trivial. Hash will follow price.  Although it's *also* true that price will tend to follow hash, at least in the short term, as the most-hashed chain is a strong Schelling point for market to converge on following a split.  Again, miners are just one kind of investor. They ""go first"" but they ultimately answer to other investors who choose whether (and how much) to value the chain(s) they produce.

"Agreed 100%. My take is that this proposal is a very dangerous and misguided one for reasons outlined nicely in Peter Rizun's recent article. But even if I liked the idea in theory, I think it should be clear at this point that it would create a major split in the BCH community (and quite possibly the chain as well) that would cause far more harm than whatever benefit it might provide. Note that I personally would NOT support splitting the chain over this if the hash rate majority manages to push it through.  I'd think it sucked and I'd be a vocal advocate of making sure it was a temporary thing that would never be repeated, but I wouldn't support a minority hash rate counterfork (""Bitcoin Cash Non-SV Non-Coercive Dev Funding Edition"" or whatever the hell it would end up being called).

">By orphaning unwilling participants essentially BCH will enforce everyone to adopt this new POW ""algorithm"".

Well, yeah, assuming a majority of the hash rate supports this madness, they can force everyone to accept it or risk being orphaned *at least on the BCH hash-rate-majority chain*. That's the nature of a ""soft fork.""  But if a hash-rate-majority-supported soft fork is sufficiently controversial, it may still act as a catalyst for a chain split. It's just that the hash rate *minority* will have to coordinate a counter-fork to avoid being swept along with the unwanted rule change.  That's essentially what happened with the controversial-but-majority-hash-rate-supported SegWit soft fork and the creation of BCH (although in that case, the hash rate majority's continued failure to coordinate a long-overdue ""hard fork"" to increase the block size limit was also a catalyst for the split).  I'd say another significant chain split is about the last thing BCH needs at this time.

>With +- 4% of the total hash rate, and going into the halving, this is a brilliant move by all the players that have BCH best interest at heart.

I have BCH best interests at heart, and I think the dev tax proposal is pretty fucked for reasons nicely outlined in Peter Rizun's recent article. I also think it's pretty fucked for more pragmatic reasons -- it seems sufficiently controversial to catalyze another disastrous chain split.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but your argument seems to be something like: ""we're gonna build a world-class BCH development team, and we're gonna make the BTCers pay for it!""  In other words, part of the appeal to you is the idea that BTC-supporting miners (who sometimes mine BCH now simply because it's sometimes more profitable for them to do so) will, assuming this goes through, suddenly be forced into *really* supporting the BCH project.  But they were already supporting BCH by securing it with their hash rate.

My point is that they don't lose that.

So the only thing that changes is the difficulty and hence securing hashes on the chain. The cost is the same to all miners so no miner is at any more advantage over the others than they are now. I don't believe this changes shutdown behaviour that is about profit, which is unchanged.

You're right that there is no free money. As I said, the cost is being paid by a slightly weaker Blockchain, and hence less attractive, and hence slightly lower priced than it would otherwise be (we might assume, although there's absolutely no way to measure that without a second universe to run the experiment in).";1;0;False;kingofthejaffacakes;ffr17mh;Economics of dev funding proposal;euoxgc;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/euoxgc/economics_of_dev_funding_proposal/
"Your scope is too narrow. If they arent mining on BCH they are mining on BTC for the same electric costs. and the profit on BTC will also go down. Let me try to explain.

Miners can flip a switch and mine any sha256 coin. Because this is  possible all sha256 coins have essentially settle on a fiat-per-hash  equilibrium so that no matter what coin you mine you are earning the  same fiat per hash. If at any point this becomes unbalanced hash power  will shift to the coin that is more profitable until this equilibrium is  restored because miners will chase profits.

This means you need to look at sha256 mining as a whole not in the scope of just BCH.If we use some rounded numbers to easier math....

BCH is \~3% hashrate where as BTC is  97%. This is roughly the ratio of  the trading price between the coins  as well. Currently 1 bch = 0.036 BTC  and the reverse 1 BTC = 26.2 BCH. (again rounded values for easier math)

12.5% of the bch coinbase reward is 1.5625 bch.

if we convert the BTC coinbase to BCH you get about 327.5 BCH. (this is to put everything in the same unit for easier math)

since  you view the hashpower on the algo level for reasons described above  you need to add the two coinbases together to determine the total amount  of fiat mined per 10 minutes. This totals about 340 BCH of value (12.5  bch coinbase + 327.5 converted btc coinbase).

1.5625 (the tax) / 340 (the total coinbase reward of the algo per 10 minutes) =  0.0045 or 0.45%.

This is where the half a percentage loss comes from.  


  
The alternative is they stop mining. but thats not really what we are talking about";4;1;False;GregGriffith;ffqp15a;Economics of dev funding proposal;euoxgc;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/euoxgc/economics_of_dev_funding_proposal/
This is a good point. I'm not sure I agree with you, but I'll have to think harder to describe why convincingly. My first thought is that the DAA means that it shouldn't matter what chain you mine on, profit is tending to zero either way. So the only real way that chain hopping is profitable is in the natural variation that makes difficulty deviate from it's ideal while we're dealing with a non static system.  The price of these coins changes faster than the difficulty adjusts at present, which gives miners an opportunity to effectively use mining arbitrage to profit. With stability, that would go away.;2;0;False;kingofthejaffacakes;ffr1o9u;Economics of dev funding proposal;euoxgc;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/euoxgc/economics_of_dev_funding_proposal/
"Thank you for putting this together. I don't understand how it's possible people don't see that it's not miners paying the ""tax"".

Most people in this discussion pretend like the block reward magically appears out of nowhere and nobody has to pay for it, while it is BCH holders footing the bill.

Since BCH holders are paying for the block rewards via inflation, they should be the ones to decide how it's being allocated (in a sense this is happening with the funding plan because the initiators are BCH whales). 

It would be great to have a platform through which people could vote on funding proposals, each vote weighted by how much BCH the signer has.";4;0;False;bUbUsHeD;ffqlx9t;Dev Fund Thought For Today - Holders Should Decide;euovbn;https://memberapp.github.io/?0775#article?post=0775726d0a

"So BCH has that too, 

BCH is money, it is cash, it is sound. It says all. There is only holding over time, and there is transfer of ownership, which is only momental.

Since it is so good, many people will want to have a balance, so in the period of introduction and adoption, which will last for some years, it is also an opportunity to win some more than normal. This is not detrimental to the system, as far as I can see, it works perfectly as day to day money too. The value change does not matter much, one day you pay 0.02 for a beer, another day you pay 0.008, so what. The wallets are very hellpful in figuring out what to pay, while the prices currently are apparently measured in AUD. But they aren't really, it is something else, what the vendor thinks he can get, and it varies by the day.

With Bitcoin BTC, it is the same, but the future fees will make small outputs unspendable, so a few hundred dollars is currently a practical minimum. Note that the fee is per output, what you receive into your wallet. So if you buy for 500, then 500, each time moving it to your personal wallet, you will have two outputs, even if you withdraw to the same address, and you will need slightly less than two standard fees to move it in one transaction. You can keep the BTC on the exchange, and let them handle it, but then there is the counterparty risk, which is real.

"The following is the truth from my perspective.

In the beginning, there was Bitcoin. Then, there were forks.

The irrelevant Bitcoins:

The currently accepted ""most valuable"" Bitcoin, BTC - An attack against Bitcoin itself. Blockstream, a corporation, subverted the Bitcoin development team and our social media to seize control of power. They're a corporation with a profit motive and have been trying to create an additional layer to profit off of the users (Lightning Network; Liquid sidechains), fixing a problem that they themselves created. Development artificially limited the needed block size to generate a fee market.

Bitcoin SV - An attack against Bitcoin Cash. Associated with an imposter who claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto. He is not (exposed in 2016). BCH will slowly, exponentially, scale alongside technology with the law of accelerating returns. BSV has plans to unlimitedly increase the block size *immediately.* Essentially, they're doing what Bitcoin Cash *intends* to do, but earlier. Before it's necessary or even possible. My favorite of the attack vectors.

Bitcoin Gold - An attack against Bitcoin forks in general that caused confusion, created during the time of BCH's inception. This fork attacked the fact that ASIC's are used for efficiency, by saying that at some future point in development that they will be magically ASIC-resistant. They also propagated the idea that BTC was a revenue stream (at the time) in that other forks, with value, would continue to fork off of it.

Bitcoin Diamond - Another obfuscation and greed play. Basically, Bitcoin Gold repeated and this time not even with empty promises. Token supply inflated. Maximum greed.

It's depressing, but we've watched Bitcoin attacked repeatedly for years. Forking is a double edged sword. It let many greedy opportunistd scam the uninformed, yet it also allowed us to preserve the original intent of the Bitcoin protocol.

Bitcoin Cash is the real Bitcoin. Bitcoin Cash will continue to be used as electronic cash in the future.";8;2;False;Ithinkstrangely;ffqlszc;Hey, just starting out with Bitcoin?

"Bitcoin Cash BCH is one of the two relevant bitcoins, same roots from 2009, but the chain split in 2017 over the transactional capacity discussion, leaving us with Bitcoin BTC (constrained) and Bitcoin Cash BCH (unconstrained). BTC does not have the transactional capacity for the many new users we expect, making small outputs unspendable due to high fees, and stopping the adoption.

So BTC is constrained, there is no more room for transactions. Price (the fee) doesn't matter, because there is no more room in the system. If there is a pressure from new users who want to send, the fee will rise just enough to discourage them (or push a current user out). And with number of users not increasing, the upside in value is also a big question.";7;2;False;ErdoganTalk;ffqifjx;Hey, just starting out with Bitcoin?

"BCH is a money type distinct from EUR and USD (and BTC). To exchange, you have to sell or buy. The same as for the different national fiat money types, but when you for example spend from a credit card in a foreign country, the exchange trade is hidden behind the card service.

To trade, I recommend the person to person market on https://local.bitcoin.com/ . Pay or receive payment via bank (the bank won't know what the bank transfer is for), mobile money, or fiat cash in face to face meeting. It is noncustidial, and there is escrow, so it is fairly safe. Consider putting up an offer to buy or to sell, if your local market is thin.

Generally, only non-reversable transfers like bank to bank, mobile money, or cash in person.

"I one million percent agree with you Jonald: this plan would likely work, and nothing ill would come out of it, as I am pretty sure the miners are well intentioned.

And yes, I also agree with you, the money is desperately needed for both maintenance and developement of the system infrastructure. If not for this ""scheme"" we might run into trouble sooner than later.

And yes, a hard coded 6 month, one-time limit, would be ideal.

But letting a group of miners gain the upper-hand on the network, put them in a position to distribute kickbacks (you know where that comes from...), create a barrier to entry and create incentives for developpers to rent-seek is just too much. I would be ready to betray some of my beliefs in order to get us out of this dire situation, but at one point, the philosophical limit has been crossed.

"The real problem is BCH is a minority chain. The minority chain is always at the whims of the ideological miners as they will sacrifice some profits to ensure its survival. Once BCH becomes global peer-to-peer cash and the majority chain this would not be an issue. That is why the miner coalition has every right to impose this proposal until enough miners shift to BCH and it is no longer an ideological chain or a minority chain.

If a new minority chain ever split off the global BCH majority chain we must respect the rights of the ideological miners for that chain in allowing them to institute their own network rules! Otherwise how could they ever survive against the coercive majority chain miners and their interests?

"Perfect summary of Litecoin:

Litecoin isn't a scam, but some people feel it's awful scammy. Allow me to explain.

When Litecoin first came out, it kind of made sense. BTC blocks took 10 minutes, Litecoin's took 2.5. Charlie Lee also multiplied the supply by 4 times, and switched the hashing algorithm so the ASIC's used to mine bitcoin wouldn't work for Litecoin, all good. Back then fees were almost non-existent, so Litecoin's main appeal was it's speed. There were no red flags like a pre mine, or unfair distribution scheme when it started.

Strike 1: Insider Trading

Flash forward to when Charlie Lee is working for coinbase. Keep in mind there was very little demand for litecoin at the time. There were other more useful/reputable coins however that weren't listed on Coinbase. One day Charlie Lee tweets something like ""Hey Brian, why don't we add Litecoin to coinbase?"", and Brian Armstrong (CEO of Coinbase) tweeted back something like ""Sure @charlielee, why not"". Pretending to make this decision on twitter was cute. There were credible rumors of insider trading (those involved scooping up as much LTC as possible just before announcing LTC would be listed on Coinbase). After the data was analysed, it pretty much proved there was, in fact, insider trading. Not a big deal, I'd do the same thing myself if I knew there was a sure thing, but insider trading is a shady move when a cryptocurrency's point man is tainted by it.

Strike 2: No use case

That brings me to the ""Silver to Bitcoin's Gold"" mantra. Sure, litecoin transactions are cheaper than BTC transactions now, and still take 25% less time to confirm. Keep in mind there are faster coins out there that make Litecoin's claim as a fast, low fee transaction focused cryptocurrency look like a joke.

So how much merchant adoption do you think Litecoin has achieved in 7 years? Obviously they're not alchemists, trying to convert silver into a ""digital gold"" store of value like Bitcoin right? I can't think of a single relevant merchant that was partnered with to create a use for Litecoin. I don't think Charlie Lee intended to make good on the promises of digital silver. It's basically another ""store of value"" focused coin. As it stands right now, the only use for Litecoin is moving crypto out of Coinbase. Personally, I prefer ETH for that.

Foul Ball: Bitcoin Core Maximalism

Charle Lee is an outspoken Crypto Superstar, I follow his twitter and it's very entertaining. He's positioned himself as a ""Bitcoin Maximalist"" Meaning he trash talks altcoins, forgetting the fact that he's made an altcoin himself. The Clayton Bigsby style shade he's tried to throw at other altcoins is unsubstantiated bullshit he parrots from overzealous Bitcoin Maximalists.

When the scaling debate heated up he positioned himself on the side of bitcoin core, ironically creating more of a use case for Litecoin by making Bitcoin almost unusable. That I can understand. What doesn't make sense about his bitcoin core maximalism positioning was deciding to use Litecoin as a live testnet for Segregated Witness & Lightning. If Segwit & Lightning live up to the lofty claims made by it's supporters, it would basically make Litecoin obsolete. Bitcoin transactions would be instant, fees would be almost non existent.

Strike 3: The Dump

""Coincidentally"", right before BCH is listed on Coinbase Dec. 20th, there are signs of insider trading again, someone is scooping up massive amounts of BCH. Also, at the EXACT same time, Charlie Lee announces he's cashed out of all his Litecoin holdings, while it's at an all time high. His excuse ""Hey guys, I wanted to be able to argue on the internet without people thinking I'm shilling for Litecoin"" 

I can't understand how this scammy stench surrounding Litecoin isn't obvious to everyone.";33;4;False;500239;ffqhd56;Bitcoin Cash Left Litecoin Behind In Every Possible Metric You Can Imagine: Innovation, Privacy, Development, Adoption, Community and now Market Cap;eungu8;https://i.redd.it/bsayuwavhbd41.png

The problem is this didn't solve anything. None of things did anything helpful.

First off 10 minute blocks are too long to wait for most transactions. No one disagrees with this. 2.5 minutes is also too long to wait for most transactions. Nothing is solved here. Obviously both of them require that either people are willing to trust zero conf, or some other solution is created such as LN.

Increasing the supply also isn't a problem. The supply is already huge. Maybe it might prove to be too small in the future, but there is plenty of solutions to that potential problem down the road.

Obviously as we have seen ASICs were soon created for Litecoin, so that didn't do anything anyway.

That's why we call it a scam. The whole premise and reason for the coin were all lies.

"That indeed gives the post some credibility. Diverted hashpower in the coming days will give it even more credibility. 1.6 exahash/s is significant, it's between one third and half of the total (depending at what time you look on the hashrate graph). Edit: they're only putting 20-50% of that mining BCH though.

Honestly, even though I like the idea of diverting some money towards development, I think the proposal as it is isn't very well though out. Having a centralized fund and fixing the rate to 12.5% gives all the power to those administrators of the fund. They could have all the benevolence in the world, it still becomes a central point of failure and a way to use the protocol-donated money to benefit who they favor. A whitelist of donation addresses would make it better. A way for miners to collectively vote-adjust the percentage would help too. But those complications also have the downside that it becomes more complicated and thus more entrenched in the protocol. Also, deciding who's on the whitelist might be a problem. Preventing protocol-donated money from flowing back to miners is a hard problem.

It's easy to say it'll last only 6 months, but software maintenance isn't going to suddenly become free after that. So what are we going to do then other than renewing this scheme periodically when the the funds run out? **If we have a significant portion of miners willing to donate 1% on an ongoing basis, then I think that's better than a 6-month burst at 12.5%.**

"Thank you for mining BCH even when it's not the most profitable at times. If you have the time, I would like to suggest a couple of things that could be done regarding the funding issue (quoting from another comment I made):

1). The first one is that there could be a BCH meetup to analize current solutions in other open-source projects, what pros and cons each has, and what results each has produced. A preliminar list would be:

- Selling additional services and support (like bitcoin.com does with the exchange etc) and directing the profits toward development.
- Selling a pro edition (not applicable.)
- When the product is too essential for a company that it compensates to donate (Netflix and Intel donating to FreeBSD.)
- Crowdfunding directed to specific proposals, like Monero does. It seems to have produced satisfactory results.
- General donations (wallets that have an opt-out donation.)
- Protocol-layer funding (Zcash, DASH.) This is where the current proposal sits, and a thorough inspection of the outcomes in other chains is in my opinion warranted.

2). The second point is that I believe that the most free-market solution is crowdfunding directed to proposals: In crowdfunding there's a direct exchange of value for value, and this creates competition amongst ideas and developers. Crowdfunding directed to specific proposals makes users feel more involved and enthusiastic, because they are donating to something more concrete rather than general/abstract (the node implementation as a whole) and are also voting with their money how to shape the project.

There's another interesting aspect in crowdfunding: If a simple p2p crowdfunding interface is developed, it can be embedded in any open-source project, not only BCH wallets and products. The app could notify the user once a proposal they like/funded reaches its goal, and also once it is completed. This gives satisfaction to the donor and it's more likely they will donate again, with better results than with traditional crowdfunding models. Something like this could onboard other projects to start accepting BCH, if it is truly useful.

More involved software bounties could also be implemented, creating contracts with blind escrows. This could enable a new ecosystem of open-source developers earning crypto for their work.

Crowdfunding combined with selling services and opt-out donations is in my opinion the first step toward a solution. If after taking this to its maximum expression there are still not enough funds, then a protocol-layer approach could be suggested, but not before.";4;0;False;user01110;ffqrrht;We are a group of miners opposing the BTC.TOP proposal, here's why;eumslx;https://read.cash/@shadow-kwh/bch-dev-fund-a-response-from-an-opposing-mining-group-4397e64b

* **""Bitcoin miners will end up paying the costs""**: Not only Jiang, but also Fyookball and Ver repeated this, even though the effect assumes no exchange rate fluctuations, no anticipation of the rule change, no mining power changes, no fluctuating costs, etc. In reality, the projected ""burden on BTC miners"" would dissipate within weeks, if not days (although likely even less, since the date would be public for months in advance). I think the statement aims more towards downplaying the actual groups who bear the cost of coinbase reward (i.e. coin inflation).

Coercing with the threat of orphaned blocks. If a subset of miners want to *voluntarily donate* to development nothing is stopping them (and if their intentions were honest that's exactly what they'd do), what I object to is them volunteering every other miner's money and setting themselves up as custodians of it.

"> Where did you get those numbers?

It's generally accepted math that 12.5% of the BCH hash will go to BTC if/when this goes live. The DAA will still adjust back to 10 min. blocks within 24 hours. So, BTC will mine cheap blocks until it's DAA adjusts, but within ~3 weeks it will be 12.5% harder to mine a BTC block, and all BTC miners will 12.5% less BTC per hash. This will cause hash to return to BCH, as it would now be more profitable to mine BCH.

It may take a few BTC DAA cycles to even out, but it will be negligible.

As mentioned by myself and others, the recent price move has already cancelled out any reduction of hash rate this would cause. Also, the increased funding for development has a chance of raising BCH's intrinsic value in relation to BTC at a much higher rate than it's currently happening at.";1;1;False;324JL;ffqpmfh;"""Oh, look, another troll!""";eulfnt;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/eulfnt/oh_look_another_troll/

"“There are miner rewards and there should be developer rewards“.

It is literally YOU that is trying to shift the narrative.

A cartel of miners demanding their competitors give them 12.5% of their income or their blocks will be orphaned is a tax. What the money is used for is functionally irrelevant.

Had BTC imposed this to “fund development” then we would have accurately dubbed it the “blockstream tax” and rightly denounced them for it.

As for development, the heavily VC funded BTC chain is developmentally stagnant while BCH has made so much progress in all areas that BTC can barely see us for dust.

This tax has nothing really to do with dev funding, I say again that what the money is used for is functionally irrelevant, the goal is the establishment of a China based tax and control infrastructure baked right into the heart of BCH (the chain most likely to achieve mass scaling and adoption).

That the Chinese miners who signed the proposal would want to do this does not really surprise me, I doubt they are avowed anarcho-capitalists and likely believe they are doing something great and good for their country. 

That Roger is on board has absolutely shocked and appalled me. This is a move so egregious, so obviously against his almost lifelong stated ethics and professional philosophy that I honestly fear for his safety in that he is being coerced in such a way that he has no choice but to comply.

This is true but I look at it in the same way that I look at democracy. Democracy allows for the abolition of itself through voting ie: people voting for tyranny, so it is up to the people to remain vigilant and prevent tyranny from forming. So in this same way people must be vigilant and make sure the protocol is used in order to protect the coin from centralization.

Ignores every valid block they make because they made someone else's block invalid when it contained no tax?

Is that how Bitcoin Cash forked? By ignoring every single Bitcoin block?

Perhaps you mean a client using the existing code which doesn't ignore such blocks? i.e. The existing software?

"Right.  Absolutely.  I know you guys have been doing a lot of work on refactoring and updating the code, which can absolutely help improve maintainability and facilitate new features, and reduce complexity and vulnerability to bugs (like the mempool bug from a year-ish ago)--all of which is definitely time/money well spent.

However, articulating the value of that work to stake holders can be difficult, but not impossible.

Imagine a ""feature"" request that looked like: ""refactor existing code to improve the fee calculation flag/mechanism so that mempool and block fees are calculated the same way so that errors between the mempool and block template can be reduced, reducing the chance of empty blocks being created that would lose the miner transaction fees"".  I think all sponsors would still want to fund that ""feature"" even though you and I know it's a maintenance kind of thing.

"From the article:

>It is not “community” money. It is miner money being made available for a  very specific purpose. I’m not convinced they need to be transparent  anymore than any normal business should be transparent. 

And this:

>I think this only works if miners themselves set the agenda and give  funding according to that agenda. When I see the ABC dev proposing that a  group of [“trusted commmunity members”](https://read.cash/@deadalnix/on-the-infrastructure-funding-plan-for-bitcoin-cash-bd372a10)  help with the funds, I get very scared, because they will be in the  position of advising on the distribution of money that is not theirs and  potentially awarding themselves funds they don’t need.

Is it really more important to raise amount X in time frame Y when the loss of miners, the community and possibly also developers and subsequently a split of the community can be avoided by finding consensus over this most controversial detail?

"Here's my developer's take on this.  I don't develop anything BCH but I developed for over 13 years (my site: [www.2logcoin.com](https://www.2logcoin.com)).

When I was paid sub-standard wages, I was still being very productive.  Over 90% of company technology was built by me.  What mattered to me personally was: 1) job security 2) right environment for me to work in.  I could take my laptop to a quiet boardroom in the office where I could concentrate on tasks and get a lot of things done this way.  If something needed work extra, I worked extra hours until it was done.  3) there were no deadlines.  Personally, I hate deadlines because people who set them are usually non-experts who know nothing about technical requirements for a project.  They set a nonesense deadline that's in their mind is reasonable and they expect you to get it done.  I think that's stupid.  Sometimes it could be done 3x faster than the deadline, sometimes it's like, an NP-hard unsolvable problem (LOL), but they have no clue.  Trying to tell them is like banging your head against the wall.  They think I'm being insolent and insubordinate.  So, 3) happened when new management took over the company and it just got really bad.

I don't know how BCH development works or who works there but that's my take on this.  Create right conditions for developers to make them happy to be productive :)

"Thanks Roger for vocing your opinion. There are two points I'd like to make, hopefully you have the time to go over them:

1). The first one is that there could be a BCH meetup to analize current solutions in other open-source projects, what pros and cons each has, and what results each has produced. A preliminar list would be:

- Selling additional services and support (like bitcoin.com does with the exchange etc) and directing the profits toward development.
- Selling a pro edition (not applicable.)
- When the product is too essential for a company that it compensates to donate (Netflix and Intel donating to FreeBSD.)
- Crowdfunding directed to specific proposals, like Monero does. It seems to have produced satisfactory results.
- General donations (wallets that have an opt-out donation.)
- Protocol-layer funding (Zcash, DASH.) This is where the current proposal sits, and a thorough inspection of the outcomes in other chains is in my opinion warranted.

2). The second point is that I believe that the most free-market solution is crowdfunding directed to proposals: In crowdfunding there's a direct exchange of value for value, and this creates competition amongst ideas and developers. Crowdfunding directed to specific proposals makes users feel more involved and enthusiastic, because they are donating to something more concrete rather than general/abstract (the node implementation as a whole) and are also voting with their money how to shape the project.

There's another interesting aspect in crowdfunding: If a simple p2p crowdfunding interface is developed, it can be embedded in any open-source project, not only BCH wallets and products. The app could notify the user once a proposal they like/funded reaches its goal, and also once it is completed. This gives satisfaction to the donor and it's more likely they will donate again, with better results than with traditional crowdfunding models. Something like this could onboard other projects to start accepting BCH, if it is truly useful.

More involved software bounties could also be implemented, creating contracts with blind escrows. This could enable a new ecosystem of open-source developers earning crypto for their work.

Crowdfunding combined with selling services and opt-out donations is in my opinion the first step toward a solution. If after taking this to its maximum expression there are still not enough funds, then a protocol-layer approach could be suggested, but not before.";3;0;False;user01110;ffq9a6h;I don’t agree with the statement in the AMA that developers will set the agenda.;eugk90;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/eugk90/i_dont_agree_with_the_statement_in_the_ama_that/

">having MINERS CONTROL the developers of a coin

What are you talking about? Miners ARE supposed to vote with their hash, as a result they DO control development by either enforcing the proposed rules by running and mining on the client that devs have written, or opposing them by changing to another client and enforcing the rules that one proposes.

Miners can e.g. either include segwit transactions in their blocks, or leave them out. Miners can mine on Bitcoin or on Bitcoin Cash. Miners can mine with ABC or with BU or any other available implementation. 

So why shouldn´t we miners throw our money at the devs that we think will work in the best interest of the coin we secure?

"Thanks for understanding. It's been worrying seeing regular users being called either trolls from one side or statists from the other.

There are multiple things that can be done. I quote from another comment I made:

- Selling additional services and support (like bitcoin.com does with the exchange etc) and directing the profits toward development.
- Selling a pro edition (not applicable.)
- When the product is too essential for a company that it compensates to donate (Netflix and Intel donating to FreeBSD.)
- Crowdfunding directed to specific proposals, like Monero does. It seems to have produced good results.
- General donations (wallets that have an opt-out donation.)
- Protocol-layer funding (Zcash, DASH.)

> I believe that the most free-market solution is crowdfunding directed to proposals: In crowdfunding there's a direct exchange of value for value, and this creates competition amongst ideas and developers. Crowdfunding directed to specific proposals makes users feel more involved and enthusiastic, because they are donating to something more concrete rather than general/abstract (the node implementation as a whole) and are also voting with their money how to shape the project.

> If a simple p2p crowdfunding interface is developed, it can be embedded in any open-source project, not only BCH wallets and products. The app could notify the user once a proposal they like/funded reaches its goal, and also once it is completed. This gives satisfaction to the donor and it's more likely they will donate again, with better results than with traditional crowdfunding models. Something like this could onboard other projects to start accepting BCH, if it is truly useful.

> More involved software bounties could also be implemented, creating contracts with blind escrows. This could enable a new ecosystem of open-source developers earning crypto for their work.

> Crowdfunding combined with selling services and opt-out donations is in my opinion the first step toward a solution. If after taking this to its maximum expression there are still not enough funds, then a protocol-layer approach could be suggested, but not before.";8;1;False;user01110;ffqbeqg;I don’t agree with the statement in the AMA that developers will set the agenda.;eugk90;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/eugk90/i_dont_agree_with_the_statement_in_the_ama_that/

"BU holds 95% of their funds in BTC and 5% in BCH.

They don't really seem to belief in their own ability to create value for BCH or they would hold  a lot more.

They seem to believe that BTC will eventually let them dev for them, run their software, increase the blocksize, etc etc. 

If ABC runs out of funding and BU comes in trying to get miners to run their software it opens us up for a lot of attacks as BU has many BSV members who can easily vote for things that are bad for BCH on purpose.

Luckily neither exchanges nor miners run BU. (or at least no significant hashrate does).

Also BU full nodes (non mining) always all update at the same time meaning it's just one person running 95% of them to make it look like BU sees more usage then it really does. 

BU is usually quiet, unless there is an opportunity to come barging in and tell everybody that a plan is not a good plan. But they never propose a realistic solution. They are primarily acting as opposition, and never goverment.  But Bitcoin is not a democracy and never will be but a bunch of mining kings who make alliances with other mining kings and do as they please using brute force to force their will on to the system. 



If BU really cared about BCH, they could just give 25% of their BTC to ABC. 

I asked Peter Rizun if I could continue his work on testing how safe 0 conf is. I had plans to start trying to do double spend attacks on memo.cash, focused on SLP tokens. Because memo.cash allows you to sell SLP tokens using 0 conf.

Peter Rizun already had a system for this and I asked him I could have his scripts to continue and not having to start from scratch. He refused.

Their values don't seem to really line up with the other devs in our community who mostly understand the value of sharing and working together towards something like how free open source software movement once really started when thousands of programmers build out Linux together.

"I built a proof-of-concept tokenized lawnmower for my latest tutorial. This was a super fun and challenging project!

The idea is centered around tokenizing real world assets. A few years ago I heard Andreas talk about this idea on Joe Rogan's show. The idea that in the future, we could trade titles, deeds, etc. as frictionless as we trade Bitcoin - and have those assets verify we own them using digital signatures.

So I built a proof of concept using A raspberry Pi, USB key, and my trusty lawn tractor.

* First, I created an SLP token that represents the mower, and sent it to an address I own.
* The code fetches the latest owner of the token with an SLPDB query, and caches it for offline use
* The code I wrote for the Pi uses the underlying open source code from Electron cash to send a message request to the USB drive, which signs using the private key.
* The Pi ""starter module"" verifies the signature is valid, and lets you start the mower using a push button connected to a relay.

Hope you like it. I had a lot of fun building it!

I'm actually not totally opposed to it. More like slightly opposed.. (but given that it additionally has the risk of a chain split I'm now even more opposed). Another reason that I don't like it might also be that I don't like ideas like Avalanche and fear that by giving ABC more money they will indeed be implemented. People tend to put developers on a pedestal and start to believe that just because they know how to write C code they also know what the best direction of the protocol is.. Satoshi was such a rare example, Amaury in my opinion is not..! 

For me it holds a lot of risk to just let him keep building the things he likes like it's his little pet project. More risk than just leaving the protocol as is for now and advance it further once we grew more and have a more mature ecosystem.

Just look at our current DAA.. There's a certain elegance in how Satoshi chose every parameter, every incentive.. it all fits together.

Who decides which block is ""immutable"" and which block is not? What if chain ending with block A has more total proof of work than block B and they differ by number of blocks that is longer than length of the checkpoint factor?

What if block C becomes orphaned? Is it a valid block or not? Who decides that it is no longer valid block, **in real time**?

Effectively no. PoW now serves as an insurance policy in case a quorum is ever compromised.  Dash maintains a very high hash rate but it really is only a backup.  In fact this is a big deal in the community bc 45% of block rewards go to miners.  Lots of discussion is now focused on reallocating some of that to MNs and our treasury that pays for development and marketing.

"The 'proof' is in Rizun's sham chief scientist-ing a thing he claims needs no science, doing nothing but paying himself anyways, and failing to provide the accounting records that the membership has asked for.

Do you deny that he has been engaging in no publicly visible development work (and pretty much never has), or do you deny that his post plainly states-- as anyone can read-- that no development is needed? If not, do you instead deny that he is paying himself out of the donations BU received to fund [development](https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-unlimited-formal-us-registration/)?

1. BU accepted >750 BTC+BCH+BSV to pay for BU development.  At Rizun's direction it kept almost all of the value as BTC in order to preserve its value while BCH+BSV crash in price... in spite of the membership voting to exchange it out of a competing cryptocurrency and into cryptocurrecies they supported.

2. Rizun pays himself out of these funds, but performs no development. Is unresponsive when the membership demands transparency and accountability for BU's records and fails follow the established BU accounting practices by withholding annual reports.

3. Now, Rizun announces that the protocol was essentially complete in 2009 (BSV and Craig Wright's party line) and that additional development funding isn't needed.

As someone who isn't a BU member (as far as you know :)), I wouldn't know about these things directly beyond what everyone can see... But several BU members beyond demanding accountability have also directly and explicitly raised the embezzlement concern without receiving a response. For example, Stein H Ludvigsen recently stated:

> If you're a BU member, and you still haven't figured out that 2 of 3 of @solex @theZerg and @Peter R have stolen the money donated to BU, you're a fool. They can't tell you how the money was spent.

You realize that for some of those dev teams, it is their day jobs (at least ABC and BU). They are working on implementations and are not selling anything. If they don't have any revenue they will stop working.

Can I remind you of one of the biggest bug in Bitcoin history so far ? [September 2018](https://news.bitcoin.com/crypto-community-debates-bitcoin-core-bug-and-a-forced-upgrade/). Every new implementation will be prone to new bugs. Every existing implementation is probably still prone to bugs.

">All right, I don't see how the 2 scenarios are different from my point of view as an investor. I paid for the inflation and who spends it is inconsequential. The coins are still increasing market supply and (all things equal) decrease BCH price, regardless if they are spent by Calvin Ayre on hookers or by a HK corporation or anyone else.

From my point of view as an investor, they're very different. But I don't want to rehash my (and Peter's) arguments as to why that's the case.  And it's not just about who spends the inflation. The effect of the dev tax is to reduce the chain's equilibrium hash rate and thus its level of security for a given coin price.  

>At least with the HK corporation there is a greater than 0 chance I benefit because of better infrastructure.

There's also a greater than 0 chance that you benefit from the ""extra"" security that would have been provided if those funds hadn't been diverted from the miners securing the network.

>Also notice that what you describe is a basic freedom of miners given to them by the Bitcoin protocol. They can extend the chain in any way they want, but have to suffer the consequences by changed market price of the coins they get. The system relies on incentives, not prohibitions.

Sure, obviously a majority of the miners *can* 51% attack the network. That doesn't mean it's something we should support.  But yes, Bitcoin's security model is based on the assumption that a majority of the hash rate will be incentivized to protect the network's integrity.

Obviously this is wrong, otherwise we wouldn't have this discussion in the first place. The dev fund is precisely to solve the dev funding problem.

> That doesn't mean open source projects require budgets

Most of them don't, some of them do. If we have the ambition to onboard the world onto BCH we need a critical mass of developers working on BCH as their day jobs. We need to have them ready to dive in the code as problem emerges. If they need to learn a huge amount of knowledge before being able to solve a problem we are doomed to fail. And that needs money.

Since BU has decided that there doesn't need to be any more development, why not return the donated funds to Roger so he can hand them over to people who want to use them?  It would cleanly resolve this bit of drama.

"I appreciate this argumentation for 'against' side, but I see a lot of counterfactuals and slippery slope points being made here, along with dubious semantics and a 'no true Scotsman' or puritanical approach to bitcoin.

It seems that Peter is assuming that the HK corp is selling the bch themselves rather than just distributing the coins? Not sure why this is assumed, but clearly it need not be the case, and I think even for the 'for' side the HK corp is a sticking point. Also, the diagram does not 'reveal' how the capital raised to pay for devs originates from investors any more than the capital raised to buy my coffee originated from investors; if I donate or spend coins, and it is assumed that the recipient is definitely selling for fiat, then investors are always 'bearing the cost'.

The notion that miners benefit regardless of whether or not the coin appreciates was simply stated, and seemingly not proven. It's clear that developers benefit, and sure exchanges do (they do anyways); but if the miners are redistributing everything, and no good comes of it, then how are they benefiting?

The issuance paradigm seems reasonable, but is somewhat semantic in that it's the normal issuance earmarked for development, instituted by the only force capable of doing so (miners), which is assumed to be acting in their own self-interest, and thus the networks best interest, which is  \~Nakamoto Consensus, no?

The Howey test notion is probably pretty important, and again I think everyone agrees that using a HK corp as a distribution medium is preeetty sub-optimal.

Essentially, I see the proposal as the ultimate-decision-making authority for the network saying ""devs need money, donations aren't cutting it, we want to donate but we can't have interest parties and developer capture like blockstream, so we're earmarking issuance towards devs in a clever way that distributes costs across SHA256 miners and forces bch-hostile miners to pay as well"". I'm not convinced that this breaks bitcoin or anything, and I agree that at very least some better solutions for the distribution would need to be presented, but the 'against' arguments seem vague and/or hyperbolic. What might change this whole dynamic is some sort of POS arrangement, but then we have the same damn argument, and if you're going to argue against POS, but then bitch when POW flexes, you're the one that's lost the plot; could you stomach a change to POS or does that break bitcoin too?";1;0;False;J23450N;ffp323f;The Best Of Intentions: The Dev Tax Is Intended to Benefit Investors But Will Corrupt Us Instead;euck8t;https://read.cash/@PeterRizun/the-best-of-intentions-the-dev-tax-is-intended-to-benefit-investors-but-will-corrupt-us-instead-012f5dbd

This part absolutely nails it:

It is 11 years later and we should be moving towards a stable protocol (without block size limits) and the role of the ""protocol developer"" should be waning.  Many people are passionate about bitcoin and will continue to do the work that needs doing. And as bitcoin becomes more important to businesses—because we attract more users—these business will also have an incentive to contribute.  But with service fees funding a wage assistance program for select developers, these select developers will block initiatives that come from the volunteer devs or companies, to avoid revealing the uselessness of the assistance program.

"Thanks for writing this, Peter.

I agree that the plan is highly problematic, but I think you're wrong on who would be paying for it. You say the investors (that's hodlers, right?) would be paying by buying the BCH issued to the Hong Kong company (HKC). But if the BCH weren't issued to the HKC, the investors would still be buying them but from miners instead. Since the total inflation didn't change, I don't see how you can say that investors are paying for it.

The way I see it, is that because hash rate will go down, it will be mostly electricity companies paying for it by selling less electricity to miners. In return the network will be slightly less secure because of the lower hash rate.

"As a long-time BCH investor (and BTC, ETH, and many others), I would say the community needs to be very weary of new ideas that fundamentally change everything without vetting it with a dose of skepticism. Absolutely every change needs to be evaluated with the idea that 'someone might be trying to screw us' like when Core took over Bitcoin and somehow no one (except a select few of us) saw the original intentions were to destroy it.

BCH is good how it is.. Do good developers deserve compensation? sure.. Does anyone have a right to add some sort of built-in tax to the protocol? Let the free-market decide. I, for one, will dump my BCH if it looks like another 'Core' type group manages to take it over or introduce some sort of flaw in it.

">We have been paying for this one very important thing - POW security - through inflation taxes since 2009. I don't see how that has led to people discussing increased inflation because more POW is needed.

>This debate is about how the inflationary money is spent. We as a community of holders pay for it in the first place, not miners (where would the money magically come from to pay miners in the first place).

There's a pretty huge difference between a system in which all newly-issued coins are competitively mined (i.e., the system described in the white paper and the way things have operated for over a decade) and a system in which a mining cartel controlling at least 51% of the hash rate dictates that 1/8th of *all* newly-mined coins (whether mined by a member of the cartel or not) must be awarded to one particular Hong Kong company.  If I acquired 51%+ of the hash rate and began orphaning all blocks other than my own so that I collected all mining revenue, that would be an obvious 51% attack.  If I began orphaning all blocks that didn't ""give"" me some minimum fraction (e.g., 12.5%) of the coinbase reward, that would also be an obvious 51% attack.  If I began orphaning all blocks that didn't give *my friend* some minimum fraction of the coinbase reward, that would also be an obvious 51% attack. And, as far as I'm concerned, that remains true even if ""my friend"" is a developer (or a Hong Kong corporation) who promises to use those funds solely to fund the development of better Bitcoin Cash client software.

The morality is not clear because BTC-Bitcoin was captured and corrupted. Those who mine it are supporting the new owners of that broken coin and helping them fool the public into thinking it is a legitimate Bitcoin. A major argument against my point is that they do not mine BTC for moral reasons, but, purely for profit. Well, that sword is sharp on both sides. For those who are fooled into thinking BTC is a legitimate Bitcoin, I have only pity.

The math is: 12.5% fee causes approximately 12.3% of BCH mining hash to move to BTC. The Dificulty adjustment relaxes and pays a smaller number of BCH miners almost the same relative amount as before. The BCH mining hash moving to other Bitcoins will cause them to be slightly less profitable to mine (0.44%?). It is a small amount, but many BTC miners are part of an anti-BCH coalition and hate this a lot.";1;0;False;Big_Bubbler;ffp33t5;"PSA: It's shocking how many people here would fail 4th grade math.

" Well written article and I think the donations coming from holders would be great in the future  just like they would have been great in the past if they had been willing. Providing them easy ways to donate anonymously would be great to add on top of the mining rewards funding proposal.

Your rational for not supporting the funding plan under discussion seems to be based on not wanting to destroy BCH's reputation by letting miners and developers team up to change important code or incentives because that would suggest we might also change other things that would harm BCH's long-term value.

I believe the troll army is pushing this false narrative everywhere they can. It is very deceptive and appealing logic, but, I think it is flawed logic. When the miners and the developers team up  to do something they think is good for the currency they do have massive power. Pretending they do not (or that it will never be exercised) is the normal thinking strategy we use on a daily basis, but, it was never true. 

Your point about ""the necessary public relations legwork"" is crucial  here. BTC miners and developers worked together with a massive social  engineering effort that allowed them to disable BTC's primary use case.  That is an example of wielding the immense power to do something that is  bad for the currency and the miners. And, they got away with it using  fake people pretending they liked the idea all over social media. BTC is  now a house of cards not because they used that power, but, because  they used it to break BTC.

Like rolling checkpoints, if the miners and the developers team up to  do something THEY AND THE COMMUNITY thinks is good for the currency it  is considered an ""upgrade"". Because miner's rewards going to development  of BCH is a great idea for BCH, those opposed to the dream of Bitcoin  have aimed all their social engineering efforts at making it seem like a  bad idea. They are very sophisticated and know what buttons to push to  make it seem like a good thing is an attack on the principals of  Bitcoin.

We do have to be very careful wielding this immense and dangerous  power, but, when it is good for BCH and the miners, developers and BCH  believers are all on board it is not going to crush BCH's reputation. We  are already the currency that does ""Upgrades"".

"That's interesting, because I think it is against their self interest as miners to pay 12% of their profit to some fund.

"It looks like we definitely disagree on the nature of the 12.5 BCH. From your point of view it's a property of the miner who mined the block, from my point of view it's primarily a property of BCH investors who decided to allocate it to miners by inflation they pay for, but it's ultimately up to them what the 12.5 BCH can be used for.

Ad your example, I think it's fine and clearly allowed by BTC protocol. What would happen is that BTC / BCH market price would drop, decreasing miners real revenue and incentivizing them not to do it. It would also encourage development of other solutions such as POS, etc. In the end, you can't prevent a miner to act in a self destructive way and damaging the network if he wants to. You can only hope the incentives are strong enough to prevent it...

I think in this case the miners who came up with the plan are also the biggest BCH investors in the world and genuinely believe this would lead to an increase of the value proposition of their investment.

"There is an assumption that my comment was made to in bad faith, and I understand why others will see it that way, but it was not. It was an observation. Regardless of /u/imaginary_username ' s intent and content of his proposal, it is something I expected once the talk (real or imaginary) that the original proposal was intended to solely, or mainly, fund ABC. I expected BU members to make competing or diverting proposals of their own.

/u/ftrader was the first I saw, with his BUIP proposal, now there's i_u.

"The problem in their reasoning is that they describe only the first leg in a set of changes to reach a new equilibrium.

It is a complex optimization problem that seeks this equilibrium. I’ll try to explain differently

Here is one part of it:
1) BCH will be less profitable to mine
2) Therefor hash power will move away
3) Hash power is part of what determines the price so prices will go down relative to what they would otherwise have been. The counter force here is that a more sustainable road map might drive the prices up.
4) Repeat from step one until equilibrium is reached.

Another part of it is:
1) There will now be excess mining power across all three mining pools.
2) This mining power will seek to be distributed and unprofitable mining units will be shut down until profitability is restored. This will be done proportionally over all three pools which makes it seem as if it’ll affect BTC the most. But another way to look at it is that BTC will get the most cleanup of old systems that should be shut down. This is how the mining power is redistributed all the time, every day so this is nothing new.
3) The only thing that is new is that it will be less profitable to mine BCH.";1;1;False;N0tMyRealAcct;ffposbq;Why the $6M Development Fund For Bitcoin Cash Will Be Paid by BTC Miners and other BCH News!;eu9py6;https://youtu.be/vFHafbC0HWo

Two problems with this. First the proposal separates infrastructure that could be funded from development.

> The funds would be used to pay for development contributions to full node implementations **as well as** other critical infrastructure.

If they had wanted to imply as you do that the infrastructure was tied to development they could have.

Yeah, so would Bitcoin Diamond. Doesn't make Bitcoin Diamond any less of a centralized shitcoin.

"The main limitation of existing full nodes is the lack of performance.  Unless future investment in BCH proves worthless, the present limits will first appear as higher orphan losses on the part of miners.   This is because other participants don't really care whether the nodes are loaded at 3% of capacity, anything under 50% will not affect the user experience.  Not so, for miners, since 3% loading implies approximately 3 percent orphan losses.  

Thus, miners are the ones to benefit from super fast node implementations.  They should be funding these competitively, and if they were to keep the major performance improvements proprietary, they could use this to fund development or just hire their own developers.  (This is already they case for code specific to mining pool operation.)  

Here there is a natural penalty for miners who do not support developers.  Their nodes will suffer higher orphan rates.  This doesn't have to be baked into the protocol in the form of a cartel.

The other users of the community, especially the investors who have significant holdings of BCH,  have more interest expanding the market for the coin. Their money would be better spent promoting new end users and developing new merchants then new code for network nodes.

Now, that does not mean that the Hong Kong entity will always be explicit about what it is doing.  We know that, so there are risks with this proposal.  But so are there risks with doing nothing.  You get what you pay for, and developers need to be paid quality salaries to produce quality work.

If, after a year or two, it starts to look like the ""funding cabal"" are a bunch of evil doers who are trying to subvert P2P permission-less money, we can always fork the chain.  Just as happened with BTC/BCH and BCH/BSV.  At that point everybody goes with the option they like best.  Forks are your friend, not your enemy, and were expected (even welcomed?) by Satoshi.  

So many people seem to be ill at ease with the amount of power and control that miners have over the system.  It's true miner power is much greater than the other stakeholders.

"Im trying to say that if bch lost 100% of hashrate, it is the bch network that is losing as an increase in hashrate is normal in Bitcoin. The 100% lost is to help understand that bch network is the one losing when there's a 12.5% lost in hashrate. The bch network loses, in this case it's security. The money to pay for developers is coming from the decrease in hashrate. As a thought experiment, imagine if one were to take 99% of the block reward to pay for development. In the end, the money is being siphoned from the security of the network itself. 

 No Bitcoin miner is paying for development . Sure it will be more expensive INITIALLY but the difficulty adjustment would make it so that it would be as if new hardware was added. An extra 3% hashrate added is normal behavior.

"Why would they if it still makes them better profit compared to other sha256 coins? It's an arms race, and ""fair"" PoW (no premine etc) coins are at a disadvantage when it comes to funding. The biggest risk to any coin is that of becoming irrelevant. Block reward self-imposed tax seems like the fairest way to divert funding to where it's needed.

The miner take-over would have happened already in that scenario. The only reason miners [agreed not to run Bitcoin Unlimited](https://medium.com/@bitcoinroundtable/bitcoin-roundtable-consensus-266d475a61ff) is because they were afraid of a community split.
