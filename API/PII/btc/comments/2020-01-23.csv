Alternatively it's the majority position, in which case I would expect the announced plan to be abandoned when it becomes clear there's massive opposition.

"You left out at least one very important reservation which has been mentioned numerous times.

There is the claim that this proposal is no problem with > 50% and that's how Bitcoin works. And maybe that would be technically acceptable if the consortium have the hash.

But the 4-5 miners in question don't seem to have those 50% of total SHA256. People have put numbers in other threads. None of these numbers have been > 50% of total. What I've seen has been more around 30%.

The question then is how is the activation of this supposed to go smoothly?

What is the required percentage of total for safe activation and further execution, to avoid e.g. the serious scenario that Mark B. Lundeberg raised:

https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/esebco/infrastructure_funding_plan_for_bitcoin_cash_by/ffapqej/

So far I don't see it addressed with a solution by anyone from the proposers or from any development team (not that I think they easily could - it's about hashrate).

One the one hand this is about unaddressed risks of chain forks due to hostile actions during activation or later.

On the other it is about currency split risks due to predictable disagreement with how this is being rolled out, and due to potentially disagreeable disbanding of the cartel at a later stage.

It is important to distinguish the fact that the sum is not coming out of miners' pockets, so the control of funds calls for a tempest.

"They are smart and gaming BTC to fund it .

If the hash on BCH goes down then that hash will go to BTC and make it more expensive and less profitable to mine BTC. Meanwhile BCH will stay at the same level of profitability and go down slightly in hashrate.

So basically the coins given to the devs will have no negative impact on BCH mining but instead will cause BTC to be less profitable.

I see that a few parties not happy with this have sold their BCH and moved on (the price dip after the announcement).

The miners obviously want to spend 6 million USD on BCH infrastructure.

Human greed has destroyed the Bitcoin invention and its currency variants. You people just don't see it yet.

Constant political conflicts and short sighted greedy egotistical disagreements, hostile takeovers and power grabs, stagnating user adoption and market cap growth to irrelevantly small sizes.

"I have minor disagreements with some of his points, but they're not worth covering. The one relevant point, though, is control over funding address. I'm fine with the proposal setting up a corporation, because that was just proven to work with the Bitcoin.com dev fundraiser. However, I'm not against entertaining an alternative, just as simple, and which may be an improvement. 

First, on the issue of fund distribution I feel the best way to handle that is using the most recent fundraiser as a template. For those unaware projects were broken out separately where, for example, someone could donate only to BitcoinABC, or BCHD etc. There was also a ""general dev fund"". In this way we saw an effective vote from the whole ecosystem for what infrastructure should get what. Since not much has changed since that fundraiser we can reuse the awarded percentages applied proportionally to the $6M; a sort of *amplified* extension.

Next, I do think it's a good, probably better, idea to make the funding address an m of n multi-sig address.

"The miners have set up this proposal in this way is because of the tragedy of commons. If there is no coercion to pay the fee, nobody will pay it.

We may whine that it takes so few miners to make a majority decision in BCH (and BTC for the matter), but this has been the case for years. Yet for the whole lifetime of BCH, miners have proven that they have the best interests of BCH at heart.

It also makes a sense from a game theory POV. On the BTC chain, the Lightning Network, if successful, would severely cap the role and earnings of miners. Not so in BCH. If the chain is a massive success, miners stand to benefit directly from it.

So I think people need to relax a bit, miners are not in it to destroy the BCH chain, quite to the contrary.";7;2;False;taipalag;ffdas59;On the infrastructure funding plan for Bitcoin Cash (deadalnix);esxgzj;https://read.cash/@deadalnix/on-the-infrastructure-funding-plan-for-bitcoin-cash-bd372a10

" I  think this funding proposal is hated by the anti-p2p-cash movement.  They have brought out all hands to fight this with lies and deceptions  and real concerns we need to be careful about. I believe there is a  massive (troll?) campaign to try to vilify the 'unknown HK corporation'  planned for receiving the funds. I believe their are many liars claiming  it is just a scam to steal the funds. I assume the big players have a  clue about how to handle these funds they are collecting for us and can  be trusted to do what they think is good for BCH. The anti-BCH forces  hate that this proposal may succeed in supporting accelerated BCH  development. They fear we will be able to fully scale for worldwide  adoption before they can stop us.

I was totally with you until you ended with 'let me control who gets  the money'. I think your team should get most of the money, but, you  cannot be one of 3 friends who has the job of determining the  distribution of funding. The conflict of interest is mind boggling.  Suggesting it makes me concerned since I can't imagine you are not aware  of how terrible that idea is. Of course you and all those you mentioned  should be advising the decisionmaker(s). 

Edit: Personally, I would prefer the funding distribution be  determined before the funds become available and have an automated  payment system to the recipients so the funds never sit in an HK  corporate wallet or bank since that would be a single point of failure  located in a dangerous location. Also, I think having a donation address for supporters that would add to  the funding and get instantly divided and distributed in the same  proportions would be a nice touch.";0;2;False;Big_Bubbler;ffd6vgc;On the infrastructure funding plan for Bitcoin Cash (deadalnix);esxgzj;https://read.cash/@deadalnix/on-the-infrastructure-funding-plan-for-bitcoin-cash-bd372a10

"No one should be surprised by this. BCH was 51% attacked back in May, and the Bitcoin ABC team almost all abruptly quit back in May due to lack of funding before - guess who! - Roger Ver stepped in and provided funds. You think Roger wants he and his businesses to continually be the sole provider of funding for Bitcoin ABC? Nope. He knows keeping them funded is vital to BCH though so he has/had no choice.

So, I can almost guarantee this is a plot hatched by Roger Ver to save himself money while fundamentally changing what BCH is. It's devious but brilliant, and no one here will call him out on it and he knows it. He's changing the protocol to save himself money.

Keep in mind: Roger Ver ONLY acts in his own self interest, and ONLY cares about making money. Everything can be traced back to those two things. He's the shadow leader of BCH and can literally do whatever he wants with the BCH protocol. And, even if people woke up to that reality it wouldn't matter because without Roger, BCH collapses. Not because it can't stand on it's own merits, but because he is almost single-handedly propping up BCH with hash rate and money that otherwise would be non-existent and BCH would be constantly attacked and manipulated, making it basically worthless.

They aren’t currently having a hard time mining — they probably wouldn’t be mining if they were. That was more touching on if/when this goes into effect and less efficient miners are priced out by the drop in revenue.

If they don't orphan non-donating blocks, it creates an attack vector where other miners get a competitive advantage and can take over.

"Ding ding. We have a winner. Yes the obvious power grab is obvious. I'm especially surprised that /u/jihan_bitmain (Jihan Wu) is an active participant in this corrupted and unacceptable power grab because Jihan signed Jiang's tax plan agreement. 

I always thought Jihan Wu was incorruptible but I guess I was wrong about that. If Jihan Wu insists on using his (and Bitmain's) influence and power to force this unacceptable tax plan to activate and become a part of BCH protocol rules, then BCH will have stagnated just like Blockstream stagnated BTC. Stagnating BTC and BCH at this point in the Bitcoin history will have effectively killed the Bitcoin invention making it stupid to keep owning any cryptocurrencies at all for us currency speculators.

Because it kicks the smaller miners that can't afford a 12.5% decrease in revenue (most miners) off the network, thereby giving these large pools even more control. Even if a miner decides to stay on the network, they're seeing a \*large\* chunk, if not all, of their profit go into the hands of an organization where they don't even have a say in how its spent.

"A soft fork happens any time there's a rule change (a fork) and the new rules are exclusively more restrictive than the old rules. This means that people that only knew the old rules (older clients) will still find blocks following the new rules valid, making a soft fork backwards compatible.

The problem of a soft fork is that it can get messy unless you have wide consensus. 51% of the hashrate is obviously enough, but is messy due to the number of reorgs happening.

"**Tyranny of the majority**

The tyranny of the majority (or tyranny of the masses) is an inherent weakness to majority rule in which the majority of an electorate pursues exclusively its own interests at the expense of those in the minority. This results in oppression of minority groups comparable to that of a tyrant or despot, argued John Stuart Mill in his 1859 book On Liberty.The scenarios in which tyranny perception occurs are very specific, involving a sort of distortion of democracy preconditions:



Centralization excess: when the centralized power of a federation make a decision that should be local, breaking with the commitment to the subsidiarity principle. Typical solutions, in this condition, are concurrent majority and  supermajority rules.

Abandonment of rationality: when, as Tocqueville remembered, a decision ""which bases its claim to rule upon numbers, not upon rightness or excellence"".

>ABC can fork them off. 

First, the announcement states that no protocol change is necessary. With enough combined hash power those four collaborating pools can orphan any block they like. ABC or any other node implementation would have no say in that. 

Second, if one client (e.g. ABC) decided to follow this proposal by implementing a protocol change and one or more node implementation did not, there would be a split. If more than one node implementation does not support this proposal, and together they gain more hash power than the one client and the four pools, then those four pools would be the ones that forked off to a side chain.

How do these pools want to verify which independent miners do donate to the dev fund and which don't without a protocol change?

"> if I cannot chose to back out of this proposed change if I'm not satisfied with how this company is being controlled and supervised, I'm going to be very pissed

This is why they want a protocol change to make it basically impossible to back out.

The BCH community would be rather stupid to fall for this attack.

If big miners want to fund something then pool their funds together, but leave the protocol rules alone.

Their instant threat of orphaning dissenters would deserve a swift pow algorithm change.

"> Because my big question is now how they want to verify that miners from other pools donated?

Wouldn't they just check when validating a block that the block's original transaction are paying out 12.5% of the coinbase to some defined address?";2;2;False;LovelyDay;ffchsef;About the proposed Dev fund change from the perspective of a small BCH miner;esswk0;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/esswk0/about_the_proposed_dev_fund_change_from_the/
