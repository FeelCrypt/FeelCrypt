"Collusion between devs and miners is a REALLY bad idea, that has ended very badly many many times in crypto's short history (premines, arbitrary inflation, chain rollbacks, 51% attacks, scams).  That's only the beginning of the problem, coercing miners will have unforeseen consequences, most likely anyone who is forced out for refusing the tax will look for retribution against those who implemented it. Also many traders will be shorting the coin on exchanges and FUDing the shit out of this controversy.

They are opposed to BCH (Bitcoin - peer-to-peer electronic cash for the world's people). Or they work for those dark forces.

"**There is always ""option C""**

An ""opt-out"" option that does not create a tragedy of the commons.

An idea that has been floated is to create an opt-out option in which miners don't get to keep the 12.5% but can ensure it does not go to the HK company. This can be a burn address or a major NGO charity like MSF or some other mechanism. **Point is, we create create an opt out function which allows the miner to not fund the HK development fund but the miner still forfeits 12.5% of the block reward thus avoiding a tragedy of the commons.**

We can even create a trigger in which if 50% or more of miners begin ""burning"" that the whole thing gets reset/removed. This way if there is dissent we do not create a harmful hash war. People can vote with their hash power WITHOUT splitting the chain. It would allow the community to respond quickly to a scandal. Right now if that HK corp suddenly went rouge cutting them off would be impossible and disastrous, this allows a mechanism for people to suddenly cut off the HK corp without a fork.

&#x200B;

Three possible mechanisms that could be implemented right now and their prospective pros/cons.

1. White-list the addresses of charities that directly accept BTC such as TOR ( [https://donate.torproject.org/cryptocurrency](https://donate.torproject.org/cryptocurrency) ). There aren't any viable competing funds that I know of but right now if we whitelist charities that is a good stop-gap measure. Pro: Absolutely 0 possible benefit for the developers, in fact they would probably lose money if people did this because the charities would most certainly do instant liquidation of the crypto resulting in downward price pressure. Con: Charities likely instant liquidate resulting in downward pressure on the price of BTC.
2. Allow miners to modify there donation to the fund so that 99.9% of it is absorbed as transaction fee (which would go to the next block) and the other 0.01% goes to the fund. For example, you mine a block with an 8 BTC reward, HK requires you donate 1 BTC. So you are allowed to do a 1 btc transaction where HK gets 0.001 BTC and transaction fee is 0.999. Pro: This method does not exert as much downward price pressure as option 1. Con: Technically the HK mining group would benefit as you'd increase their potential block rewards as well.
3. Let users choose between options 1 and 2.

----

No user-activated soft forks for highly controversial decisions that were never on the roadmap. Non-mining users will consider blocks valid regardless of whether the donation is present. If some miners wish to experiment with stronger requirements on block validity, they can, but they should not push for non-mining users to fight alongside them. Node developers should ensure that default node configuration is neutral.

"My summarized position:

> ###Conclusion

> ""We have proposed a system for electronic transactions without relying on trust. We started withthe usual framework of coins made from digital signatures, which provides strong control ofownership, but is incomplete without a way to prevent double-spending. To solve this, we
proposed a peer-to-peer network using proof-of-work to record a public history of transactions
that quickly becomes computationally impractical for an attacker to change if honest nodes
control a majority of CPU power. The network is robust in its unstructured simplicity. Nodes
work all at once with little coordination. They do not need to be identified, since messages are
not routed to any particular place and only need to be delivered on a best effort basis. Nodes can
leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the proof-of-work chain as proof of what
happened while they were gone. **They vote with their CPU power**, expressing their acceptance ofvalid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on
them. **Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism.**""

The miners have the Satoshi-Given right to enforce new rules and incentives as needed, as its part of the overall bitcoin experiment.

Edit: We can argue about pragmatism, but the moral right to make decisions is logically sound as the contract between the users and miners laid out in the whitepaper hasent been breached. For pragmatism, i think a 12.5% reduction in security in order to fund the developers a much needed 6M for just a temporary six months, is not a threat to security, but could accelerate the BCH roadmap to being much closer to being finished.";10;4;False;J-Stodd;ffg42eu;Miner’s Plan to Fund Devs - Mega Thread;etfz2n;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/etfz2n/miners_plan_to_fund_devs_mega_thread/

">[A]s long as the economics of the protocol remain solid, we need to push forward [with an imperfect solution]....This step is one among hopefully many that will begin in 2020 to prepare Bitcoin Cash for global adoption, and miners are taking an executive role in this process and showing their commitment to making this happen.

Let’s be honest, miners are subordinate to developers.  Developers made the mining protocol, implementations, libraries, and algorithms. Developers made bitcoin itself. It’s ridiculous that developers have to pay lip service to miners, and ironic that, for the lip service they pay miners, they get zero pay in return; its developers that have done, and continue to the heavy lifting in the bitcoin ecosystem. 

The important role miners played in the early days of bitcoin was providing a “fair” and secure way to distribute the coin supply.  But I’ve come to realize that mining is neither the “fairest” (if you define fair as equal opportunity for an average Joe to participate), nor the most secure design. It’s also not the most economical (in the Misesian sense) way to build an free-market monetary system. I know that’s not going to be a popular thing to say, but I’m not here to make friends, im here to help create a viable digital cash to free humanity.

There’s too much to say about that for one comment, but one relevant point to think about in this context is this: Think about who is going to make the most economic use of newly minted funds, large mining pool operations, who will likely sell most or all the BCH directly for fiat to cover their fiat-denominated operating costs, or many individual developers, who will more likely save, or better yet spend it at Dash-accepting merchants both online and local?";-4;1;False;ISkiAtAlta;ffga3yf;Bitcoin.com's Clarifications on the Miner Development Fund;etfy8n;https://read.cash/@Bitcoin.com/bitcoincoms-clarifications-on-the-miner-development-fund-80828a53

The other problem I have with Dash is the instamine. It's something that can never, ever be taken back and it will forever tarnish Dash.

"Thanks for posting this. Just spent a good 30 minutes perusing that site.  The CCS looks pretty cool actually. 

Bitcoiners should definitely look into the work flow here for inspiration. 

What I like about the $6M fund proposed by BCH miners is that the source for developer funding comes from the block reward, thus, from all BCH holders (I’m not willing to concede that it comes from all SHA256 miners).

What I like about Monero’s CCS is that the community gets to be involved in where funding goes (both by direct donation to specific proposals, and commenting on said proposals). Also nice that funding is based on accomplishing milestones.

It’s clear from my Reddit history that I like Dash’s funding model the most, as it combines the best of both of the above, and is more decentralized, scalable, and sustainable. But it’s nice to see all of these projects figuring out ways to provide internal funding, all of which I consider voluntary, free-market systems (not taxation).";14;1;False;ISkiAtAlta;fffnffk;Alternative to the 12,5% mining tax: Monero CCS;etcuc2;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/etcuc2/alternative_to_the_125_mining_tax_monero_ccs/

As computed [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/et387w/somebody_help_me_with_the_12_math_if_the_hashrate/ffebnn3/), the effect of the 12.5% tax will be the same as if the BCH price was 12.5% lower than what seen on exchanges.

But this isn't ""someone dislikes it"" it's a misrepresentation/misunderstanding of what is actually going on.

Miners banding together to officially fund development makes me *incredibly* bullish for BCH. I expect this scares the shit out of bch detractors and miners who despise bch and try to game the DAA for profit (they'd be paying the majority of this development fund).

Prominent bch figures who disapprove of this aren't against miners funding development, they're against the implementation of the plan. Some concerns are valid, some are a bit less so. Could the funds be misused? Yes. Could this cause a chain split? Yes. (Although not any more than the scheduled 6 month hard forks). I could go on.

However, banding together behind a solid (while imperfect) proposal is incredibly important at this stage. Acting *now* to do something that has a very high probability of success is better than waiting for the perfect proposal that will have everyone agreeing (hint: this is impossible and therefore will never happen).

This is what happened with the blocksize debate, nobody could agree on how specifically to raise block size and it never happened until someone said fuck it let's do it.

Same thing with DAA and CTOR. History repeats itself and inaction until a perfect solution is found is an anti-pattern that plagues every industry including software engineering. I deal with it on a daily basis at work.

"> it is nearly fully absorbed by the greater SHA-256 ecosystem, as mentioned in the proposal

Temporarily maybe. At the greater timescale, the entire coinbase reward is inflation that is essentially absorbed by actual currency holders.

People use different perspectives when they react to the original proposal of governance, but I think most of it essentially boils down to this.

The funding will be part of the costs borne by the stakeholders, a sum they will have decided to pay for development instead of hashrate, in principle. That is why any governance model that does not appeal to that part of the ecosystem is going to be erosive.

> We absolutely, positively MUST include code in the node implementation that shuts off the donations after 6 months, so it is the default behavior of the software.

Cut-off by default is a good idea but also the political cost of everyone agreeing for this sort of change should not be wasted. Going forward with a simple and decent implementation that can be improved iteratively would be the best approach.

Doing this transparently through a smart contract will create technological and political progress. If Bitcoin Cash does not opt to manage this through its smart contract capabilities, it will be a tremendous loss of opportunity and face.

So this isn't something enforced by the miners, but will be a hard-fork protocol change? As in, all (non-mining) nodes will only follow the chain that has this hardcoded address in it where 12.5% of the coinbase will go to? Not the longest chain regardless of where the coinbase is going?

So the following (from the proposal) is completely irrelevant and a lie since it is a protocol change, and orphaning doesn't matter since nodes wouldn't accept the blocks without the coinbase ""tax"" anyway?

> To ensure participation and include subsidization from the whole pool of SHA-256 mining, miners will orphan BCH blocks that do not follow the plan. This is needed to avoid a tragedy of the commons.

> d) This is not a protocol change. Instead this is a decision by miners on how to spend their coinbase rewards and which blocks should be built on.

I would rather these thought leaders would just be straight with the community instead of dancing around what the real proposal is here. Because if this is the case it seems dishonest and really isn't a decision that can be taken by miners, but it's a decision of what rules go in the protocol. What miners do will be irrelevant since if they deviate from the miner reward they will be forked of the chain in any case, no matter how much real miner support (as in hashrate) it has.";17;1;False;backlogg;fff7m8m;Little Known (But Important!)

This will result in net losses for pretty much everyone, and the devs won't be getting as much money as they expected.

I think these guys all had a back room meeting and they got talked into a corner by these Chinese miners. Roger, Fyookball, Amaury, and others are some of the top people in the crypto space, but they should all be ashamed of themselves for backing this dogshit proposal.

"The only thing that gave the plan some legitimacy is that it was about miners collectively disciplining each other.

As I said multiple times, I don't think democracy works for software projects, but:

- Miners should have freedom to support the implementation (as in BU or ABC or bchd or others) that profits them the most long term. This is the smart greed satoshi wanted and put in the whitepaper. Each team should have a separate dictator. If a dictator goes bad and the project starts losing utility and value, miners choose other project and other dictator.

- Users(we) should have the freedom to buy and sell the currency, express our opinions and criticize the moves of miners and developers, so hopefully when miners start losing or gaining more profits, they will notice that they have chosen well or chosen wrongly. 

- Dev team's dictaror (such as Amaury) should have freedom to decide what tasks he will work on.

Full nodes are power of network and can keep miners and even devs in check (for example, BTC implemented SegWit in a way BTC devs did not want to implement). It is reality and it was already used. If full nodes reject certain version of blocks (for example ones with tax), miner that is taxing is loosing money and miner without tax is not and full nodes are not loosing as they are cheap (or at least they should be) so miners HAVE to keep in line with rest of the network. 

It's up to you. Do nothing and let others (miners) decide for you and support centralization, or you can run full node that will reject change and vote against it.

"At this point:

This I think is just an inevitable outcome for every PoW chain that gets bigger. Direction over the monetary policy will always produce a dominant implementation that is well funded, via VC or other means. Everyone else can only create compatible network clients, not unlike there are other versions that can play with Core  but ultimately Core sets the rules with full miner support until the miners decide to capitulate with their policy. The only thing keeping them with Core is they have no incentive presently to change this paradigm, because they are all making shitloads of money between the miners, pools, and exchanges. BCH simply never came close to challenging this status quo, because quite clearly having big scaling *for later* is not what the market values *right now*. 

The only *decentralized* component of the protocol is that its a way for independent parties to verify the state of a ledger and determine whom has publishing rights to add to it. That has fuck all to do with the community or what it wants or how people holding $1000 worth of coin think they have the right to vote: they don't, and never will, there is only the choice to stay or move to a different network. This is business at the end of the day, any notions of a feel good reach around in this space are misguided at best and we have 11 years of evidence of that. 

There is nothing written or implied with this that ""honest miners"" cannot form a cartel under a singular source of network policy which they also fund directly at their sole benefit. Fore BTC its Core, for BCH it seems ABC is going to be it most likely now. For each player in the cartel, incentive still applies to punish a bad actor and encourage validating in good faith. Other players can still enter the game and mine as followers, and they can also take their hashpower elsewhere if they disagree with policy change.

"The most important aspect of this that people seem to be overlooking is that this has NOTHING to do with development funding.

The dev funding is a complete red herring, an attempt to steer the narrative away from the truth.

The issue has nothing to do with dev funding, what the money is used for is functionally irrelevant.

The issue is a cartel majority of hash saying to their competitors “give us 12.5% of your income or we orphan your blocks”.

The undeniable reality is that this cartel has declared that they possess full centralised control over the BCH chain and are exercising that control.  

In this first instance to extract money from their minority competitors but we are very much in a “ I have altered the deal. Pray I do not alter it further” situation.

I repeat, we must stop talking about dev funding because it is completely irrelevant to the situation, BCH is now fully centralised.

"Because miners are the ones with authority to make these kind of decisions in a POW system. Users can of course sell or buy what the miners are mining, and that price signal is important for miners (see BTC vs BCH, BTC is worth more even though a lot more miners prefer BCH than 3%)

And users can use something that other miners are mining. But the longest POW chain is how decisions are made on the Bitcoin network. Not harmonious unanimity. It's raw hash power. So sure some miners may disagree. The idea that that matters is something that you're importing to Bitcoin though. Of course, it enough people feel as you do, and they have miners and developers to back them up, and BCH goes through with this, then two coins will form.

 It appears to me this controversy about funding BCH developers is being   used in an attempt to divide the Bitcoin (BCH) community again.

"Why Debate? 

I choose to follow ""Non-Debate Theory"" it was ""invented"" by Jiang Zhuoer (hmm, he seems to have removed it from his Medium Post (I wonder why)  


Here's a live video of me reading it:  [https://twitter.com/Rhett800cc/status/1220459381462130689](https://twitter.com/Rhett800cc/status/1220459381462130689)   


Following the ""Non-Debate Theory"" of Bitcoin Cash's new Mining Cartel overloards, I chose to SELL all of my Bitcoin Cash.

The most alarming part of the entire article in my opinion was this part:  


"" If we assume a current price of $300 per BCH ""

... excuse me.  The most INSIDE people at BCH are ASSUMING a current price of $300?  I'm OUT

I'm assuming MANY INVESTORS will follow once they realize what this means.  My largest concern was not simply that a 28% Hashrate Chinese Mining Cartel thinks they can take over Bitcoin.  My concern was that EVERY Leader in Bitcoin Cash supports this plan.  


In the early days of Bitcoin, we talked about this kind of attack when we first realized that Satoshi solved the Byzantine General's Problem using Proof of Work.  It was known that PoW relies on the assumption that 70%+ Miners are HONEST.  


This TAX only works if 70% of Miners are DISHONEST.  Normally I would expect the community to rally against DISHONEST MINERS, but that's not happening.  I'm shocked that the leaders are SUPPORTING DISHONEST MINERS so therefore I am double out.

I don't trust a centralised, single-point-of-failure to not go rogue, not have an operator go rogue, not have the funds stolen, or not have them seized by the government. None of the signatories can ever guarantee that this can't happen.

"Many of us here who hold beliefs that don't follow the r/btc talking points like ""BCH good, BTC bad"" are unfortunately so rate limited that you won't hear our voices as they are drowned out by the comments of people who can post at will. While not exactly the same as the manual censorship over at r/Bitcoin, it has a similar chilling effect. Personally I try to remain as active as possible here but what it means is that very often I will type up a thoughtful response or opinion just to have it rate limited when I attempt to post. Unless I actually save the post to my computer and then try again later for the most part those posts are just lost. This mechanism definitely results in a very one sided conversation as many times I won't even bother responding since I know I'll probably be rate limited. Even this comment I'm typing now will probably fail to post, but I'll copy it and wait until I'm allowed to post it. I can only imagine if this is happening to me it must also be happening to many others. When the rate limiting is based on downvotes it creates a sort of feedback loop where downvoted content (usually alternate view points) reduces the presence of the very same alternate view points, creating the appearance of group consensus when there is non, which then leads to more downvoting of the opposing views, and so forth. If the intention here is to create a self sustaining echo chamber where only certain thoughts are allowed, then it is working wonderfully. If the intention on the other hand is to create a space free of censorship where all thoughts and perspectives can be heard, then there is certainly a ways to go before that is the case.";3;0;False;shazvaz;fffn65s;I just want to thank the Bitcoin Cash /r/BTC community for supporting free speech and engaging in vigorous debate without anyone calling for censorship.;et986f;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/et986f/i_just_want_to_thank_the_bitcoin_cash_rbtc/

"Miners are motivated by profit. By saying they want to fund development, it's effectively saying that they think the BCH coin will be more valuable, and mining will be more profitable as well, if some percentage of the hash rate is forced to fund development.

The question to ask is this: if miners can take $6million and spend it on adding features to the coin, then will that result in a greater than 6 million increase in market cap?

It's not a question anyone knows the answer to with certainty, but it's something not at all unreasonable to consider. It's a political question, and resolving political disagreements through voting with hash power is exactly the kind of governance we all signed up for when we invested in the coin (whether you knew it or not).

Six million dollars isn't that much money. BCH has a market cap of about $6 billion. This isn't a very big deal in context. 

Also -- If the proposition passes, the miners are very incentivized to ensure they have some concrete development features done with that money, to raise the value of the coin by more than the amount they spent. If they don't, they'll be doing net harm to their own holdings and the value of their own mining equipment.

Makes no sense to switch to that for someone who has been saving every euro or dollar he has been collecting in a savings account for years.

People will throw their money at the next best safe investment. That was gold in the past and silver. But since Europe has just restricted anonymous gold purchases, its kind of obvious to me that people are going to move it either into other material things if they want to stay anonymous, or into company shares with low volatility if they have paid their taxes.

It will become more and more difficult to anonymously buy and sell anything. Crypto could be a solution to that, we all know that. But the government's won't let us.

Its basically going to go the same route that we saw in entertainment hardware. For decades we were able to connect anything to everything with analogue cables. Today there is only HDMI and Display Port left. New TVs and PC monitors are not even having any analogue connectors anymore and try to a find a framemeister anywhere on ebay today. They cost a premium price. Everything today runs with HDCP encryption. Millenials might not notice this of course, but anyone who still has an original super Nintendo does.

"Without speaking toward Musk being a profit, this is largely a correct assessment in my opinion of some of the effects that negative interest rates will have.

I don't necessarily think there will be an outright ban on cash though anytime soon, at least not in the USA, because of the possibility of panic it might cause on markets and citizens. Also, it's way too soon here. We don't even have negative rates here (yet).

The effect will be different in different countries, with the US dollar probably being one of the last dominos to fall, and not for quite some time. You're easily talking 10 years or more.

Crypto has about a 200 billion market cap. You get one more 10x increase, and you're at 2 trillion. Market cap of all the fiat is maybe 80-100Trillion right now. 

So we're at least two 10x increases to get to a $20 trillion cap, and I think as time marches on, the volatility will go down, and so will the rate of increase versus fiat (on a percentage basis), but on an absolute basis we're going to see a huge spike as millions of people flood in.

"**Greek government-debt crisis**

The Greek government-debt crisis was the sovereign debt crisis faced by Greece in the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2007–08. Widely known in the country as The Crisis (Greek: Η Κρίση), it reached the populace as a series of sudden reforms and austerity measures that led to impoverishment and loss of income and property, as well as a small-scale humanitarian crisis. In all, the Greek economy suffered the longest recession of any advanced capitalist economy to date, overtaking the US Great Depression. As a result, the Greek political system has been upended, social exclusion increased, and hundreds of thousands of well-educated Greeks have left the country.The Greek crisis started in late 2009, triggered by the turmoil of the world-wide Great Recession, structural weaknesses in the Greek economy, and lack of monetary policy flexibility as a member of the Eurozone (according to certain arguments).

Legacy addresses generally imply higher fees, and guarantee that you won't profit from the SegWit discounts on fees (or access to LN or side-chains).

* Purposefully limit and prevent the fee selection more on Bitcoin only. Selecting 1 sat/byte is not an option for Bitcoin although transactions with 1 sat/byte do get confirmed on a regular basis.

Of course it's Ver's right to do this with his company/app, but pretending that none of this is confusing/misleading to newcomers who have just heard about Bitcoin is disingenuous. It's done with the intent of deceiving/misinforming.

The fact that he attempts to prevent any usage of Bitcoin with the lowest fees possible and usage of SegWit are also deliberate attempts to present an unfair comparison between BCH and Bitcoin.

As I said, it's his right to do this, but people who pretend that his reputation is unjustified have no ground to stand on.";-9;2;False;diradder;ffeq3i1;the bitcoin.com wallet 🤡 unfairly...;et80as;https://youtu.be/wBORJXOjjrA

"Well aside from that missing Flowee, I don't know if an equal split is the best way to go. Some node implementations seem to contribute more value than others, kinda noticeable by who's running nodes with their software. I think it's apparent that too many node implementations and the cost of subsidizing them as equals might turn out their existence being net negative. For example we could just count up how many nodes are being run under each implementation, and give money to them in proportional amounts instead. If we did that, hypothetically, it would currently look like:

ABC: 734 nodes

BU: 705 nodes

BCHD: 27 nodes

Flowee: 1 node

It's kinda strange, because after this, https://cash.coin.dance/nodes says only two more nodes are listed, but there's more than two node implementations left on the list. Bcash, Verde, Bitprim, Nextcash, and Parity Bitcoin.

"Fair point. I was generally feeling favorable to the change, but I’m still glad OP made this post to give us food for thought.

I am troubled by the percentage siphoned for development. IMO 12.5% seems very high. If history is any guide, Bitcoin will rise, then surge in value later in 2020 or in 2021, and BCH value should be much higher than it is today (seems like the most undervalued coin today among the larger market cap coins).

12.5% of mining rewards when BCH is again even $2K will already be an enormous amount of money under centralised control (not to mention if it goes much higher).

"> I asked why would you say that a miner is harming the coin if they do not donate? They are still helping to secure the chain.

Because in the last 5 years, we've learned that if you do not secure the developers in addition to the chain it's all for nothing. Miners must secure both the blockchain and development.

> Then anyone who did not want to donate would be breaking the protocol and would hard fork off. But by doing it as a soft fork they are not even allowed to fork off.

It's possible we adopt Dash's/Zcash model. Lets see how this 6 months test goes.

> Hell, given enough hash, we could force BTC miners to donate as well by orphaning their blocks if they don't. You don't see this as an attack?

Sure I can see it as an attack. But compared to the alternative which is risking developers getting paid by another Blockstream this seems like a lesser evil.

Should miners decide to steal 50% or 100% of all coinbase reward simply by 51%ing then they weaken their own coin, as miners leave, it becomes centralized and value of the coin goes down. There's a balance and incentives still at play.

> It is one thing for miners to utilize their power to use selective orphaning of blocks to revert or discourage theft and other crimes with victims (even though most would argue that a coin should be use agnostic otherwise it is not like real cash currency) and it's different for miners to use that power to punish victimless ""crimes"" like not donating to some committee decided dev group.

With 3 forks to mine with SHA256, if someone doesn't want to donate they switch to BTC/BSV and lose no money.

> Where people donate is their own decision.

And how has that worked out?

"I don't think you answered my question. You explained very well why it is good for the miners to donate to devs. I asked why would you say that a miner is harming the coin if they do not donate? They are still helping to secure the chain.

The only way to argue that they are harming the coin by not donating would be if they had implicitly or explicitly agreed to donate and they tried to not do so. One way of this being the case would be if we coded in the protocol the donation. Then anyone who did not want to donate would be breaking the protocol and would hard fork off. But by doing it as a soft fork they are not even allowed to fork off. Hell, given enough hash, we could force BTC miners to donate as well by orphaning their blocks if they don't.

It is one thing for miners to utilize their power to use selective orphaning of blocks to revert or discourage theft and other crimes with victims (even though most would argue that a coin should be use agnostic otherwise it is not like real cash currency) and it's different for miners to use that power to punish victimless ""crimes"" like not donating to some committee decided dev group.

Where people donate is their own decision. I could make an argument that right now it is better for BCH if we freeze development of new features and invest 6 million into advertising in Venezuela and training people on how to use it. We could get a million of new users using BCH and it could spread to nearby countries from there, plus it would directly help people in need. How would you feel if I forced miners to donate for that cause instead? What is the best way to donate money is a thing that we can debate for ages and we'll never reach a conclusion. Doing 51% attacks on miners who don't share your opinion about where donations should go is a very aggressive tactic and it should not be the way Bitcoin works.

Also, I don't see how a cartel of miners deciding which developers get how much money is worse than having a single company donating to whoever they want.

As I read the whitepaper, orphaning was a tool to enforce the limitation on double spending. Blocks with invalid transactions would be orphaned, not just any policy that a cartel of miners came up with. See section 5 Network. In step 5 of the process for mining, blocks are accepted if they have valid transactions. See section 6 Incentive. Stealing back payments (double spending) is the identification of a dishonest miner. Not refusing to divert his payment to a cartel. I don’t think it’s proper application of the nakamoto incentives to use it to enforce a tax.;4;1;False;hawks5999;ffetvg4;The so-called proposed “infrastructure fund” is a hostile takeover of Bitcoin Cash development.

"Dude, imagine you are a miner, you have invested 1 million dollars on mining hardware, you like to mine BCH and you're running on thin margins, then a cartel comes to you,( the violence part) gives us 12.5% of your mining reward or we will orphan your blocks, now you have 3 choices:

1- Giving up on mining and loosing your 1 million dollar investment. 

2- Mining something else (Giving the cartel the total control of BCH mining market).

3-Give the cartel the 12,5% block reward.(Making your mining operation unprofitable, else you're part of the cartel).

Yes if you haven't been keeping track. Developers are not funded regularly and consistently. Read some of Amaury's posts as well as the BU funding conflict if you haven't because you're asking questions that are known.

> A private company will have the power here too.

A private company can still donate and fund developers, but ultimately the miners must still secure developers to do what's best for BCH and not the private company.

"you need to look at sha256 mining as a whole not in the scope of just BCH. bch is ~3% hashrate where as BTC is 97%. This is roughly the ratio of the trading price between the coins as well. 1 bch = 0.036 BTC right now. or the reverse. 1 BTC = 26.2 BCH

12.5% of the bch coinbase reward is 1.5625 bch. 

if we convert the BTC coinbase to BCH you get about 327.5 BCH. 

since you view the hashpower on the algo level not the coin level it means you need to add the two coinbases together. totalling  about 340 BCH of value. 
1.5625 (the tax) / 340 (the total coinbase reward of the algo) = 0.0045 or 0.45%. this means ultimately the miners are only losing less than half a percent profits

now this isnt exactly the 0.375% figure i used earlier but thats because the coin prices have changed since then, but this formula was the same one that was used.

">Second: the miners who want this change are planning a 51% attack to  force it through. This attack will guarantee them control over ALL  protocol development FOREVER. Whoever controls these funds controls the  protocol. These so called “concerned” miners can donate to ABC or any  other implementation any time they want right now and on a continual  basis if they really think Bitcoin Cash development is in trouble. It’s  not. This isn’t about funding, this is about them having control.

You clearly don't understand mining or what's going on here. The proposal clearly have a time limit, and since it's a soft forked only enforced by the miners, it can only hold up as long as the majority of the miners wants it. As soon as a majority no longer supports it, the initiative will dissolve. The problem is that any pool attempting to shave off a part of the coinbase reward and pay their miners less would simply lose all their customers. Either everyone does it, or no one does.  


>This plan isn’t about supporting developers, this plan is about stealing  from from other future miners, wrapped in a fake cloak of concern.  Whoever controls these development funds will be all powerful. This  entity will be able to force changes they want and exclude those they  don’t want from protocol development. Remind you of anyone? Blockstream.

This is just FUD and speculation with bad intent.  


>This will also ensure their future control when they might not have 51%+  of the hashrate. They are future-proofing mining profits.

This simply doesn't make sense and is just bullshit. Soft forks only work if majority hashrate supports it. The exchanges and wallets would follow the longest PoW, so miners would be incentivized to abandon the initiative quickly if they lose the majority.  


>If this hostile attack/takeover goes through, Bitcoin Cash will no  longer have decentralized development. It will be forever tainted with  the disease of centralized corruption and control. BCH will be a dead  coin.

More FUD and bullshit. The majority of the miners have always had the power to enforce any rules they want. Nothing in this suggested initiative will change the current state of development in BCH.  


These FUD attacks and misinformation about the funding initiate will only hurt BCH in the long run.

The Bitcoin Cash community has dealt with governance failure before on the original chain during the Blockstream hostile takeover. The solution then was to abandon the BTC chain entirely and move to the alternate BCH fork. Assuming BCH supporters still believe this was the right approach, the exact same solution can be used once again to migrate away from the BCH chain to a new chain which does not include the development fund. If a majority of BCH hashpower supports the fund then the new chain can simply adopt a new name and a new ticker, and implement replay projection just like last time.;-1;2;False;shazvaz;ffem7vg;The so-called proposed “infrastructure fund” is a hostile takeover of Bitcoin Cash development.

 - Miners can donate any time they want.  If they like nothing stops them publicly advertising their ""development escrow"" address and then demonstrating that they are putting funds into it via every coinbase transaction.  51% of them do that -- loads of funds.  And no one has to do it.  Make website that call out the miners that aren't doing it.  No need for a fork.  No need for protocol changes.

 - Tragedy of the commons is indeed a risk.  Tough shit.  It's less of a risk than putting hard coded auto-funding into place.  Let's remember that the genius of Bitcoin's original design was that Satoshi made the selfish behaviour of the miners good for everybody with no centralised manager to decide that good.  That was magic.  It would need a similar level of magic to implement something like this.  Until something better than a hard-coded coin-base address is invented, we're stuck with tragedy of the commons.

 - As you say 12.5% is a ridiculous amount.  Imagine bitcoin core had such an amount in place right now.  12.5% of 12.5 bitcoins every single block would be (at today's prices) __$682 million a year__ (`6*24*365.25*12.5*8300*0.125`) for ""development"".  No way.  We're aiming for BTC price levels aren't we?  Even if we use BCH price today, it's __$25.5 million__ (`6*24*365.25*12.5*310*0.125`) -- again, a startlingly large amount.

Want BCH to fund you?  No problem -- buy some.  If you're doing a good job on infrastructure then the price will go up and you'll be incredibly wealthy anyway.  We do not need a centralised funding system (it's always centralised because someone has to be responsible for managing where the funds go).";35;1;False;kingofthejaffacakes;ffekxk6;The so-called proposed “infrastructure fund” is a hostile takeover of Bitcoin Cash development.

"Amaury makes a good point in his read.cash post that cartels are unstable and that the moment this cartel starts doing other things, it will be broken apart.

I am trying to convince myself that this cartel is not different from an Avalanche cartel, where miners will be rejecting perfectly valid blocks to force out of the coin miners who confirm double spends. But these two don't seem to be the same to me.

A miner that accepts double spends is harming the coin by abusing a loophole in the validity rules (the fact that the first-seen rule cannot and is not normally enforced). Such a miner deserves to be pushed out of the coin if they do not change their ways.

I cannot say the same about someone who will be forced to pay some developer that they may otherwise hate. Why would we force out someone who doesn't want to pay ABC or BU and is perhaps donating money to eatBCH or whatever? How is not donating actually harming the coin to the point that we would be better off if they did not mine in the first place?

This sound extreme to me. And a very risky experiment despite the 6 month limit because it sets a precedent.

"I posted this elsewhere, as based on reading the coindesk article:

[https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-cash-miners-propose-controversial-soft-fork-for-zcash-style-development-fund](https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-cash-miners-propose-controversial-soft-fork-for-zcash-style-development-fund)

>Many community members, Zhuoer writes, don't currently contribute  anything at all, creating a ""tragedy of the commons"" situation where the  self-interest of individuals is contrary to the common good of the  network.  It may be controversial, but redirecting block rewards is  ""undoubtedly a far better solution"" than the current funding system, the  post reads.

To argue that it's a tragedy and therefore you need to coopt the system via a mandatory tax directed to a central planning group because you don't like the rate at which issues are resolved doesn't directly solve the bug fix issue and is a bogus argument.

>Signed by Jihan Wu of Antpool/BTC.com, Roger Ver from Bitcoin.com and  ViaBTC's Haipo Yang, Zhuoer's post argues there are ""significant  problems"" with the current funding mechanism. Donations are made on a  voluntary basis, making it difficult to finance long-term projects and  giving corporate donors ""an undue influence"" over developers.

It's just a bad way to go as you are establishing an on-chain monopoly, which is a far worse situation than the claim that ""corporate donations"" could influence development. All donations influence development, period, but all donations are *voluntary*. You would be implementing a central planning system into the currency where a specific group of people receive the tax and then decide what gets funded and how. Clearly the mining groups who signed this petition consider development valuable, but therein lies the conceit of implying *it's valuable therefore we will make it mandatory, and we will be the beneficiaries of the tax*. If it's valuable then people will want to fund it.

If you as a developer can't persuade people or other miners to support you, those who benefit from stability, then that's a failure of advocating on the merits. This is turning into a few people wanting to modify the money system in favor of benefits dependent upon a partial control of the system's value generation. There's also a terrible precedent being made in trying to set a specific and arbitrary percentage to allocate to ""development"". I don't think anyone is saying developers shouldn't get paid or that they aren't needed, either.

What's really bad is those who have said that this is a voluntary activity, but that you will not include blocks mined by miners who do not consent to paying. That defies the very meaning of voluntary. People will say this is a trojan horse, or a takeover, extortion, or a tax, but we know at the end of the day that it is still a fork.

Choosing which fork to follow may be voluntary, but predating on a system whose existing value was created without a tax and then saying you want to impose a tax which goes to one group is really an astounding modification.

It also upends the notion that transactions will be validated with parity when you compare the current situation with the proposal. Miners should have discretion over the minimum fee they accept to process transactions at best.

The best solution is to form a coalition between developers, miners, exchanges, and users on a voluntary basis and get this sorted out, not to modify the function of money. That way when there is a need to correct bugs the community can step up together and deal with them.

The moment you start putting central funding schemes on-chain is the moment you've begun to erode the value of decentralization. BCH as a userbase has witnessed how BTC was coopted by bad development, so it's not surprising that this is controversial.

The only time a crypto currency should be modified is to deal with security issues. Giving developers a blank check is not an actual crypto security fix. More of a job security fix. Development has value, but that is for the marketplace to determine.

>Funds will also be directed into an unnamed ""Hong Kong corporation"" that  will coordinate and pay for network development. It's not certain  whether this new corporation will pay third-party developers or if it  will do most of the work itself, like the Electric Coin Company (ECC) on  zcash.

This isn't merely developers wanting to write their own paycheck, but miners wanting to determine development via a cartel built into the currency, being operated by a corporation.

"I'm eager to have an objective debate about this and plan how to best execute it together, since I myself am still not fully onboard, but it's really not helping your argument to act so hyperbolic about everything. 

Amaury doesn't have complete control, and this funding isn't guaranteed to go exclusively to him or ABC. We have an impending halvening, miners are comfortable and familiar with their mining rewards reducing, and usually see it as a reliable way of increasing price, as it makes supply more scarce for everyone mining. 

As a miner, I'm optimistic about these funds going to development, as this is one of the biggest money multipliers possible IMO, and it's proposed to only go on for 6 months, during a period of heavy and hostile solo mining - https://cash.coin.dance/blocks/today

This measure would make these attacks less profitable, and cause them to indirectly benefit BCH.

"Bitcoin Cash has to be funded if it wants to succeed. It is going to fail if it doesn't. Respected OG bitcoiners like Jonathan Tommim and many others, who worked with Gavin Andresen back in the day, are [tentaviely OK](https://old.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/esqjqf/development_needs_a_financial_incentive_satoshi/ffditdk/) with this proposal. Other people, like Jon's brother, are against it. My point being, just because you are an original bitcoin and bitcoin cash supporter, does not mean your opinion is the best or shared exclusively by your demographic or those closest to you.

Bitcoin Cash needs major, consistent funding, if it wishes to succeed, accomplish its stated goals, and be competitive. The system we have now is completely inadequate. I understand the arguments from people who disagree with this. But it is God's truth.

Your post is also a bit sensational. It's not a healthy dialogue, but rather, abrasive and tribalistic. You can disagree with Amaury, but I do not believe he is a greedy power-hungry person who doesn't care about anything but himself. I think if I had to guess, Amuary wants to see BCH _succeed_, nothing more, and he is smart enough to know, from both his perspective of working on it every day, and his past career experience, that this is completely necessary. Perhaps he needs work on his own social skills at times, and he is by no means perfect, but your painting of him in such a way that almost throws him out, is terrible, and a perfect example of why BCH has such an uphill battle.

One of the greatest strengths of BCH is our love of liberty and freedom. We all have our own thoughts and we are allowed to disagree. It is this spirit that sets us apart from many other projects. However, with that, comes problems, in that we value individualism so much, that we fail to recognize the importance and necessity of seeing ourselves as each a part of the whole, and we scarily toss people aside at a moment's notice. This is not sustainable, and if it goes on, BCH will destroy itself. There has to be some degree of community at some point. Obvioysly the splitting of BTC/BCH was necessary and unavoidable. Think of it like the American Revolution. But that kind of mindset should _always_ be a last resort.

Having miners be the funding source of development, at least for a little while- miners with lots of BCH, who are depending on the longterm success of BCH, and whose incentives are otherwise aligned with and dependent on the coin succeeding by scaling as big as possible- are better equiped to fund development than the other options, such as private companies that make money selling sidechain solutions (Blockstream), and unreliable small community donations.

There are problems with the proposal. It is very vague about key issues. How are the funds dispersed? How long will it last? Will percentages vary depending on USD coin price? How will this Hong Kong ""company"" be set up? The proposer did not answer many good questions that were asked in the [recent AMA](https://old.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/esoi5s/ama_jiang_zhuoer_author_of_infrastructure_funding/). That is a problem.

These are the kinds of discussions we should be having, not such alarmist tribalism and quick-to-shutoff ism. BCH can not survive any more fracturing. As Carl Sagan said, ""An organism at war with itself, is doomed.""

Emin Gun Suer had a [great twitter thread](https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1220293287044620288?s=19) about this proposal. As did many other comments around this subreddit. I think it is much closer to what a better outcome would be.

>He comes across as greedy when you compare his actions with that of Gavin Andresen, who gave countless hours to the project freely and made Bitcoin Cash what it is today.

Not wanting to bash Gavin, since he's a good guy and I'm thankful for him, but his lack of action and conciliatory attitude was the reason why Bitcoin Cash ended up having to fork in the first place. Had he changed the code to remove the 1mb limit back in the past when big blockers were the majority, Bitcoin would be working perfectly today, perhaps even Ethereum would be running on top of it, adoption would be way greater and we wouldn't be here.

Gavin made a serious mistake by not acting when he should. And had he acted, he would certainly have been called a ""power hungry individual trying to destroy Bitcoin decentralization"". This kind of scare tactic was probably why he didn't act in the first place.

"BCH is running into the same problem Bitcoin did years ago, which is: how do you keep dev teams funded appropriately in a *hyper* competitive field (crypto devs/coders/engineers)? Bitcoin doesn't really have this problem because outside sources/companies have a vested interest in keeping Bitcoin's dev team well funded, and it's open-source nature allows companies to hire their own devs with the main focus on improving the Bitcoin protocol, and they get a return on their investment because they have a vested interest in improving Bitcoin. BCH doesn't have funding from these types of sources because A) the community generally despises the idea of having outside money potentially influencing dev teams and B) there aren't many profitable businesses operating in the BCH ecosystem. There's really only one entity: Roger Ver. Without him and his businesses funding BCH development, there would be a massive talent drain from people leaving Bitcoin ABC and the other couple dev teams. And make no mistake, Bitcoin ABC is the backbone of BCH. If they leave this project, it falls apart. They're arguably the only entity more powerful than Roger Ver in BCH's future. It is why they successfully were able to essentially blackmail the BCH community and Roger back in May when they all - Amaury in particular - threatened to quit. Amaury is somebody who could easily be making north of 6 figures USD with his skillset in the crypto world, but was getting paid - according to him - very, very little, if anything, before he came out in May and threated to disband Bitcoin ABC. And, while Roger and the community did successfully fund the dev team back in May, it was only a bandaid on a critical flaw in BCH's chances for success, which is you need sustained massive investments in dev teams or else those people eventually leave. People don't like working for significantly less than what they're worth. This isn't like Satoshi, who worked on Bitcoin without getting paid for it but was earning huge block rewards constantly. These dev teams aren't getting block rewards. Miners don't give a single shit about keeping BCH dev teams funded. They just mine the most profitable coin.

Now, it's extremely obvious to me that this was a collaboration between Roger Ver, Bitcoin ABC, and a couple other major players because this has to be 51% attacked to change the coinbase rules. Roger controls a large amount of hashrate needed to get this done, and Roger himself could've just personally kept funding the dev team if he wanted to (he doesn't).

This whole ""6 months"" thing seems like a farce to me as well. What are they gonna do in 6 months if the dev team still isn't getting funded properly? If this gets through the community now, the people controlling the coin know they'll be able to do it indefinitely.

"> Second: the miners who want this change are planning a 51% attack to force it through. This attack will guarantee them control over ALL protocol development FOREVER

How so ? The proposition is time-limited.

Hostile takeover, Trojan horse, 51% attack, dictator... You don't have to agree with this proposition but making such claim is only steering the community apart.

">One criticism of cartels is that they collude with one another. Murray Rothbard criticizes these terms for being emotive. What is really occurring is cooperation. For what is the essence of a cartel action? Individual producers agree to pool their assets into a common lot, this single central organization to make the decisions on production and price policies for all the owners and then to allocate the monetary gain among them. But is this process not the same as any sort of joint partnership or the formation of a single corporation?  

That's Murray Rothbard. 

OPEC has been incredibly successful as a cartel. This is a natural development of the free market as Vin Armani says. If people want BCH to be as successful as OPEC then we need to consider taking a page from their book.

>They vote with their CPU power, expressing their acceptance of valid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on them. **Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism.**

Funding developers is a needed incentive and it can be enforced with the consensus mechanism. This is Bitcoin working as it should have done from the beginning. As an investor and a developer, I'm glad the miners have finally picked up their sword.

Miners should make a proposal, solicit support for that proposal, gain 51%+ hashrate and enforce the proposal by rejecting invalid blocks.

Currently the proposal seems to be: Send 12.5% of all mining subsidies for six months to a HK company controlled by 5 players who'll decide what to do with the funds later.

As a miner, I would vote my hashrate against that proposal. Creating a slush fund like that is a good way to waste money in an unaccountable way and will invite waste and corruption.

"Instead of asking this question you might as well read the announcement article in which it was explained.

The BCH ecosystem provides a platform for miners to earn a lot of money, but they are not interested in re-investing anything to support the environment that made it possible. By getting together and creating the funding plan, the big miners who are also BCH investors who are interested in long term appreciation of the network are saying: we are reinvesting a certain percentage of our revenue to improve the system and if you want to make a profit by mining in the system, you have to do the same or risk having your effort wasted.

Notice that the miners who came up with this plan are taking a lot of risks. It is not certain that they will be able to enforce the rule, as anyone is free to join and mine in opposition. Since all of them are also well known BCH whales, their interest is in long term success of the BCH network - if they make a wrong decision, they lose a lot of money. 

For me personally this initiative is the most exciting thing besides cashfusion - people with most skin in the game in the entire BCH ecosystem cooperate to improve the long term value proposition, majority of the money comes at a tiny decrease of POW (which will become irrelevant after avalanche anyway) and it forces people like Calvin Ayre to contribute back to the ecosystem that allowed him to make money (which he then uses to patent troll and harass BCH devs).";0;0;False;bUbUsHeD;fff8bsw;"Why are people saying ""this miner donation proposal came out of no where"" ?

"This has been debated on and off since at least 2018. It didn't come out of nowhere for everyone.

This is a system of voluntary participation - each party has their own set of voluntary actions they can take:

right now, it seems some miners chose to build in a given direction, regardless of what the other miners might prefer. This is a voluntary choice.

Miners are incentivized to participate in the system and to stay in consensus.

Given that consensus is subjective to the context it's in (the BCH hashrate is not in consensus with the overall sha256 hashrate, for example) it stands to reason that the incentive mechanism is only able to ensure certain gaurantees.

When this proposal takes effect, the market will simply have to decide how much it deems it to be valued at, and then take the voluntary action to either participate or not.

Namely, the BCH hashrate will drop by something between 12.19% and 12.5%.  That of BTC and BSV will increase by something between 0% and 0.44%

Here is the detailed math.  Assume that the prices of all three coins will stay constant through the tax activation, say at 8300, 310, and 250 USD.  (Silly assumption, but without it we cannot say anything.)  Also assume that all three have the same ""raw"" block reward, 12.5 BTC/block, and same target block rate, 1 every 10 minutes (6 per hour, 144 per day).  Also that the tx fees are negligible compared to the block reward.  And also that there will be no new chain splits on that occasion.

The raw reward for mining a block of a coin c is 12.5 x P[c], where P[c] is  the coin price.  Currently, that is also the miner's revenue R[c] from each solved block.

The difficulty D[c] of solving a block coin c can be expressed as the expected number of hashes needed to do so.  The total cost C[c] of mining a block -- including electricity costs, manpower, hardware depreciation, etc -- can be assumed to be proportional to D[c]. The profitability of the coin is the ratio R[c]/C[c].

It is not useful to think of ""BTC miners"", ""BCH miners"", of ""BSV miners"".  There are just ""bitcoin miners"" who can mine any of these coins, and can switch very quickly between them.  A rational miner will switch immediately from coin c1 to coin c2 if c2 has higher profitability.

However, the difficulty eventually gets adjusted to make the block rates equal to the target rate, meaning that D[c] will eventually be ~~inversely~~ directly proportional to the hashpower H[c] that is mining coin c.  As miners switch from a coin c1 to a more profitable coin c2, the difficulty (hence mining cost) of c1 drops and that of c2 increases, until their profitabilities become equal.  Even if some miners refuse to switch for ideological reasons, if there are enough rational ones mining c1, that equilibrium will be reached.

It follows that, once the dust has settled, the hashpower H[c] mining each coin will be proportional to the miners' revenue per block R[c].  Currently, that is proportional to the price P[c].  So, apart from transients caused by price changes, the current total hashpower H[tot] is split between the three coins in proportion to their prices. that is

  H[btc] : H[bch] : H[bsv]  =  8300 : 310 : 250  =  0.937 : 0.035 : 0.028

After the tax activation, the revenue R'[c] for mining a BCH block will become 0.875 x 12.5 x P[c], while R'[c] will remain the same as R[c] for the other two coins.  It is as if, for the miners, the price of BCH had dropped by 12.5%, to 271  USD.  So, after the difficulty adjustments, the total hashpower H'[tot] will split as

  H'[btc] : H'[bch] : H'[bsv]  =  8300 : 271 : 250  =  0.941 : 0.031 : 0.028

So, **as a fraction of the total hashpower,** the hashpower of BTC and BSV will increase by 0.44%, while that of BCH will drop by 12.19%.

However, the total hashpower will drop too, because the tax on BCH means that miners as a whole will earn less money.  The total revenue for each set of three blocks, R[tot] = R[btc]+R[bch]+R[bsv] will drop from 12.5 x (8300 + 310 + 250) to 12.5 x (8300 + 271 + 250), that is, by 0.44%.

It is not possible to compute the hashrate drop, H[tot] to H'[tot], from that number alone.  It depends on the distribution of profit margins among the miners.  

In the ""worst"" case, if all the miners are on the brink of giving up, the total hashrate may drop by 0.44% too, so that the miners who remain will be in the same situation (once difficulties have adjusted, which may take a long time).  Then the hashrates of BTC and BSV will remain unaffected, while that of BCH will drop by 12.5%. 

In the ""best"" case, all miners have large profit margins, so the total hashpower will remain the same.  Then the changes will be as above: the hashpower of BTC and BSV will increase by 0.44%, while that of BCH will decrease by 12.19%.";12;1;False;jstolfi;ffebnn3;Somebody help me with the 12% math.

"Those 12% of miners will probably move to BTC more of the time due to a lower block reward on BCH. Then more mining hash on BTC will fight for the same BTC reward and the total of all the miners there may experience losses from previously expected profit levels of around 97% of the donation amounts due to increased mining on BTC for the same reward. 

This proposal may make BTC miners support our developers. IMO, that's a big reason for the massive and often dishonest attacks on the funding proposal.

"The math above says that the loss will be (eventually) between 12.19% and 12.5%.

The *immediate* loss, just after the tax is activated, may be a lot higher.  Indeed it is quite possible that 50% of the miners will leave.  Then the block rate would drop by half (1 block every 20 minutes on average), and then the difficulty would take twice as long to adjust.

In theory, when the tax is activated -- or when there is a sudden price drop -- **all** BCH miners should leave for the other coins.  Then the BCH chain would stop, the difficulty would never get adjusted, and the miners would never come back.  

Presumably the BCH CEO trusts that there will always be some miners who, out of laziness or for ideological reasons, will keep mining BCH, even if they earn 12.5% less than what they would earn with other coins.";4;0;False;jstolfi;ffemiod;Somebody help me with the 12% math.

Their cut also cannot be redirected to a competing dev fund if the miner is dissatisfied with the chosen dev fund's performance. This is why I call it a ""privileged"" dev fund.

"I think it's bad short term, but good long term. No other coin has money other than donations to put towards its goals. It will take time to prove that the money will be spent wisely though. Just like a country which uses it's tax proceeds poorly, so can BCH. OTOH no great country is without tax revenue. Likewise no long lasting currency in history has ever been free from taxation, or expenses like printing, minting, anti-forgery etc. Why should a digital currency suddenly be free from that liability? What if btc was born without a transaction fee, and suddenly created one? There would be backlash but it would ultimately be good, if it wasn't done purely for profit.

BCH has become essentially a bitcoin core without transaction fees, but with a mining royalty. Which by the way every currency in history has benefited from mining royalties.

It makes it almost an order of magnitude easier to 51% attack for a long period of time for starters.

"Parking logic for competing chains is always necessary. The change in question is 'block finalization'. That's the secret sauce. I already had this discussion with vampire troll u/cryptocached (are you him in disguise?). I tried looking up our exchange where I refuted his dates challenge but reddit doesn't store back that far apparently. 

Anyway here is the Yours.org post I made weeks prior to the reddit post, and prior to the finalization code you're talking about. https://www.yours.org/content/bitcoin-s-model-is-antiquated---moving-beyond-present-vulnerabilities-037758764825/#comments

Looking at it doesn't do much good because both Yours and Reddit only give ""1 year ago"" which is an estimation. The original Yours post I believe was 3-4 weeks before the reddit post. I could probably ask Ryan X. Charles to find the exact database entry date and I'm sure he'd confirm the earlier date as I say. But 1) I don't know Ryan personally and 2) it's not that big a deal.

That's why I'm taking my sweet slow time coming out with a fix for the ""10-block rolling checkpoint"" which solves 51% attacks but opens an attack vector for splitting the network (which I won't cover for obvious reasons). It will become clearly obvious that without my input, nothing on that issue seems to progress, as we're seeing. And when I do come out with a fix the community will acknowledge it's me, not downvote my submissions and steal my ideas as has been the pattern. Otherwise, I produce no fix. Someone else can try.

I don't think it touches on the most important point of doubt regarding the proposal, though. The fund is a centralised entity controlled by a few.

"They have addressed that. Ryan Taylor, the CEO of Dash Core Group has stated that Dash's optional privacy mechanism doesn't break the ""travel rule"" since it only obscures the source of the funds and the source's wallet balance and all transactions are still visible on the chain. Since you need to declare the funds anyway when depositing into an exchange you are adhering to the travel rules, ie: I mix my wallet to hide my balance but if challenged I can show them where I got the funds to buy the Dash, but no-one else needs to know how much I have.

Dash's Privacy features are no different from ~~CashFusion~~ CashShuffle, except it's built into the protocol and due to the robust masternode network, a much better implementation of mixing (trustless, onchain, more mixing rounds etc). You should be as worried that BCH is delisted due to ~~CashFusion~~  CashShuffle.

These comments from Taylor has reversed some exchanges from delisting Dash and in fact many more have integrated Dash since then, some even with InstantSend or very low confirmation rounds (eg: Coinbase only requires 2 confirmations for deposits, though it can be none and just support InstantSend like a bunch of other exchanges that do). Also want to mention, *DASH is the ONLY PoW coin that can be instantly re-spendable like cash.*

I also want to say to all the BCHrs reading this. Almost every single post in this subreddit for the past 2 days has been about this topic, one opinion after another. In Dash, we don't have this level on contention. If there's is a need for discussion or making a decision, it's simply put to a vote to the DAO and the DAO will decide what's best.

Need bigger blocks?
Dash: just vote on it and in 24 hours the decision was made.
BTC: Let's argue about this for 2 years and split the chain in 2 and more and then slander each other for the next 2 years and more.

I would like to touch on market a little.

1. Market doesn't like uncertainty and this fund proposal brings a lot of it. That will put negative pressure on price now, plus when and if funds get implemented. At least short term pressure.
Notice, that market is irrational too. Otherwise it would reject btc chain already as it is not working to its design and purpose. And yet, it still attracts more hash power than Bch, because it provides more chances of actually existing in long term. Nevermind question - what for?

2. Halvening is near. It brings some price movement expectations, but worries and more uncertainty too. Implementing this fund around the halvening might be not the best idea itself. Saying that, committed miners might actually be the best assurance halvening will go smoothly.

3. Notice also, that nothing has happened yet; fund is just proposal, and still we witness core minions (bsv probably too) popping up like mushrooms crying sky is falling. Simply to use it as an excuse to stir shit.

">Market doesn't like uncertainty and this fund proposal brings a lot of it.

&#x200B;

What about the consideration that it brings an amount of certainty? At the moment, where funding comes from is decidedly random. ABC has, so far, managed to stick to their roadmap in the face of these uncertainties. Other developers as well have continued to stay the course in developing their own projects.

"> Do you think it's a controversial stance to think that miners are ultimately in control?

I do not. Ultimately miners are in control, since it is they that create the blocks and put user's transactions in the blocks.

> Is aligned incentives + skin in the game not enough to dictate which members of the community have the power to unilaterally change the rules?

The following is difficult to express (I just do not have the words): The narrative has changed to incorporate the UASF into the UAHF (I think /u/jonald_fyookball , maybe, expresses it well) since the fork. And, at all times the miners decided what happened, not the developers. The developers merely provided the software (I do not mean to belittle the devs that did this, it's just the a fact), so I believe that the miners can unilaterally change the ""rules"". But this is not, or may not be, what we've come to understand as a consensus rule, nor it is the same as increasing the number of mined tokens (though many will, for whatever reason) associate this with that rule.

> I do agree that funding address belongs to the miner coalition(commonwealth?) and not to any specific dev team. Dev teams should start bids for work.

I can agree with this, but I'm willing to watch and see how this is worked out; hoping that it works out well.

> I also agree that sinophobia/xenophobia is a large part of this reaction as it has seeped into some more toxic aspects of Western culture (speaking as a born Westerner who regularly talks with Chinese/Hong Kong Natives in their language). I don't trust China either and am aware that Hong Kong is shaky but a company stationed there seems safe enough as long as it's only a company on paper rather than offices.

Effectively, you will have one team mining on top of all valid blocks and the other team only mining on top of cartel blocks. Suppose that this situation persisted for even a full day before the remaining cartel members concede and fully dissolve the cartel, or those who left concede and re-join.

This would effectively give 2 people in this group a veto power over spending, and, obviously, miners would also have veto power as they can decide to discontinue the plan.

"The miners are not donating anything.  What will happen is that percentage of miners will leave, difficulty will adjust to compensate and for the same price the miners will now have a spare $6m.  This is assuming the market price of BCH doesn't drop in a proportionate manner which is my guess but seeing BSV jump up in price has shaken my faith in the market valuing stuff properly.

If it does go through then it will be another fascinating experiment on the hash versus price debate for those sitting on the sidelines.

I would think long and hard about how this compares to how you feel about blockstream and which method is more open.

I personally disagree with this method, even in stuff like dash.

"Gonna provide some insight here about the sinophobia/Western perspective here.

In the Chinese perspective Deng Xiaoping was the most libertarian member of the Chinese Communist Party(CCP). Under socialist policies led by Mao Zedong people literally starved, millions of them. When Mao finally passed and Deng Xiaoping took the reigns he had a conundrum about going against the CCP and risk being ousted whereas continuing Mao's policy would certainly doom the country. So he made an insidious compromise with CCP member to retain power whereby certain ports were to be allowed to trade with the West with some oversight. These ports were turned into concentrated capitalism centers almost overnight and this is why Westerners don't understand the Chinese perspective. Yes, he killed people in Tianamen (arguably CCP would have forced it) but he opened pandora's box by blurring the lines for what can be done in socialism and what can't be done in socialism to create the modern brand of Chinese capitalism. He definitely knew that capitalism would never leave.

>""Planning and market forces are not the essential difference between socialism and capitalism. A planned economy is not the definition of socialism, because there is planning under capitalism; the market economy happens under socialism, too. Planning and market forces are both ways of controlling economic activity.""  -Deng Xiaoping

What Jiang Zhuoer’s attempting do here is the same. He wants to create a political structure as controlled by majority miner coalition to enact radical changes. To try things, radical things and as long as they align with network incentives (as Satoshi intended) then it would open the opportunity to creating an open-ledger world-wide political structure.

I think the endgame was always to have 200 mining companies from over 100 countries forming a mining coalition with nodes to safeguard fair play while still allowing dissenters of coalition to fork off during disagreements. Let the debates begin.

I agree with Jiang Zhuoer’s plan and I think we should implement it without fancy smart-contracts as long as all members of the miner coalition agrees with the method of control for funds in every aspect. If they fail, BCH dies anyways.

"Nice post OP. I see several things that are VERY wrong with this ""proposal"" that really is a ""threat to orphan blocks"". The first is that any miner who disagrees with these new rules will mine another coin, for at least the six months that the ""donation"" (tax) is imposed. After that period, MAYBE they would come back to BCH, but I would expect the BCH/BTC and fiat prices to be at all-time lows due to the decline in mining. Therefore the incentive to switch back to unprofitable BCH would be very low.

"Be precise. Only blocks that contained specific tx that were stealing funds held in segwit addresses (because they were interpreted as anyone can spend addresses by legacy nodes) were orphaned by the miners who upgraded to a client with segwit activated.

Miners did not have to upgrade to a newer client, but would have to fear that their blocks might contain such transactions that other miners would reject.

That's different from this situation. There miners were forced to keep everyone's funds safe. Here miners are being forced to transfer parts of their own block reward to some company that's supposed to do something great with it.

You didn't have to participate in segwit even if you upgraded to a segwit client, you could actually exclude segwit transactions all together from your own blocks like at least one pool did without any consequences.

There you had a choice to not participate. Here you don't.";1;1;False;grmpfpff;ffeiabv;About the proposed Dev fund change from the perspective of a small BCH miner;esswk0;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/esswk0/about_the_proposed_dev_fund_change_from_the/
