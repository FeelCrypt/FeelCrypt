In most respects, that's right. However, in this case, it appears to be a contentious effort to introduce a system that has been somewhat refined by Dash.

"Watch the video I mentioned in that post above. It is true we are low on Hash and the funding proposal would be expected to lower it. 12.5% and then our difficulty adjustment equalizes things and BTC miners end up ""paying"" 97% of the funding. Your video is short. Watch the first 2/3ds from a BCH fan perspective.  That's as far as I got.

Also, we are already too low on hash, that's why BSV attempted a 51%. It failed and that attack coin still exists. It failed as other such attempts would because we have massive BCH-friendly BTC-Miner-hash waiting to protect us when needed. We also have battle tested developers who do what it takes to protect the only Bitcoin still seriously working to allow the scaling required to become peer-to-peer electronic cash for the world's people.

"To be blunt, I really have no respect for people that make being a ""Philosopher"" their job. Philosophers don't do anything for society, they just ramble and shove unprovable ideas down other people's throats. It's like a religious person who's lost their religion. Philosophy has no testable predictions, so all philosophical presentations that don't use formal logic with scientific facts only are bogus from the start.

It's like someone is 14 and thinks they're really deep, but can't move past that stage.

As a user in this space, believe me, nothing would make me change my mind and leave faster than a bunch of idiotic philosophers running around fighting over who's nonsense is better. Same goes for the religious blend of philosopher. I would not be in BCH if at every turn someone in the community was giving me the pitch for coming to Jesus Christ.

I think it's okay to make humble predictions and inquiries on philosophy, but not if you make it your main job. It kind of appalls me that the economy feeds people for being opinionated idea shills.

"The top mining pools cannot do anything they want. However, pretending the miners and developers working together is too dangerous a precedent because a slippery slope problem will lead to [insert horrible result here] is a common scare tactic being used to fool the community into thinking because we are using this dangerous power to do something good, we will certainly lose control and destroy BCH in the future. It is a dangerous power we usually pretend we will not exercise, but, when we do it on BCH it is called an ""Upgrade"" and we are careful about what upgrades we do.

The HK company ""booggyman"" issues the trolls are spreading are easily avoided. It is good to bring them up so we can avoid any pitfalls. That said, if the money was stolen or not spent well, it would be the MINER'S MONEY (the miners who set up the system and are trying to donate) that would be lost. If something goes wrong, it would be sad but BCH survives just fine. I think we can trust these millionaires+ have a clue how to avoid losing their money.

Yes, people who donate can have an affect on the future direction of BCH. It is a miner concern with an amount this size, but, we have been captured and attacked in many ways and I think we can handle this pressure this time.

It's a legitimate concern. You can not just dismiss it by saying it's s debate tactic.

"The reason why miners are not attacking BCH is because the majority of SHA-256 miners are in favor of peer-to-peer electronic cash and want to protect it. Even though they are not mining it all the time, they have miners on standby and will switch them on if BCH comes under attack.

If BCH changes to another algorithm then it loses those miners and the security they provide.";7;0;False;playfulexistence;ffvwlys;Why doesn't Bitcoin Cash change its mining algorithm?;evhhlj;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/evhhlj/why_doesnt_bitcoin_cash_change_its_mining/
"Personally Ive never felt it to be that important these days what the mining algorithm is, being SHA256 doesn't make it ""Bitcoin"" alone as an engineering choice. Satoshi only chose it because it already existed and was developed by NIST, so he could be reasonably sure it would be a secure choice that he didn't have to create from scratch. SHA is not special, and in fact was already almost a decade old by the time Bitcoin-QT was released.

Since Satoshi's original version dozens of mining specialized algorithms have been developed. Ultimately as long as Proof of Work is provided the design goals are met.

It is a difficult proposition for BCH to change it however- 

1. It would definitely invite the trolls to declare ""BCH is a shit altcoin afterall"". There have already been dozens of alternate algo forks of BTC, many of them scams, many of those I think were intended to try and wash BCH out as ""another one"". We've seen those dozens fall flat because just changing the algo isn't enough on its own to make it succeed.

2. Terminal damage to the BCH community and market that continues to disintegrate into smaller factions.

3. it might end up still only a minority hashpower chain. If an existing algorithm or a new one starting with GPU mining is used it would be open to attack, and otherwise could fail to attract miners that are already spread out to 100s of other coins. A new algo would require fresh NRE to develop ASICs, without wild success no mining gear producer would bother. At least with SHA, BCH has a hook in the most developed and well invested infrastructure.

Overall it doesn't seem advantageous to do this since BCH faces the same situation either way, any alter-algo version of BCH would quickly sink into the shitcoin abyss probably.

Id rather see BCH beef up its double-spend resistance in other ways (Avalanche, proofs, etc), and rework the DAA to be resistant to the gaming we see on it currently.

With utility comes value, from value comes a price point that draws more SHA hashpower to BCH.";3;0;False;mechabizon;ffw335a;Why doesn't Bitcoin Cash change its mining algorithm?;evhhlj;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/evhhlj/why_doesnt_bitcoin_cash_change_its_mining/

"### Moloch

Here are some easy to digest explainers of the Moloch DAO structure if you're not familiar

https://concourseopen.com/blog/moloch-dao-explained/

https://medium.com/odyssy/moloch-primer-for-humans-9e6a4f258f78


tldr: 

1. Interested parties contribute towards a fund and receive shares in the fund
2. Members can propose projects (their own or others) to be rewarded with shares in the fund
3. Members vote whether to accept projects
4. Members can cash in their shares anytime

### A Lot to Like

I like it for a number of reasons

1. Voluntary
2. Get your funds back if you don't like the direction the fund is going
3. Participate in the proposal/voting at much or as little as you like
4. Low voter participation doesn't grind the whole thing to a halt
5. The funding can exist alongside other funding streams.
6. It's not permanent, nor does it need to be temporary
7. Fund can grow or shrink 
8. Wide range of proposals can be considered.
9. Oversight of proposals and delivery
10. Wide range of people can participate
11. Proposals can be funded quite rapidly

It's a smart contract that runs on ETH. We don't have the ability to run it on Bitcoin (not yet anyway) but I think the real innovation of Moloch is the structure and rules rather than the autonomous nature of it.

The following options are available to us

1. Keep the treasury in BCH, have a secretary apply the rules of Moloch manually and create treasury transactions, but use multisig of x of y multiple trusted individuals to sign treasury transactions.
2. Run it on Ethereum with wETH treasury - (https://daohaus.club/)
3. Run it on Ethereum, use wrapped BCH (I'm unsure of the feasibility of this)

My preferred option is 1 - I'll also volunteer to be the secretary with a view to funding that role and outsourcing over time.

My point exactly! But that's not the case with this proposal.

Miners force holders to allocate some of the inflation towards development instead of security. They are using the false premise that the money for the fund is coming from miners (BTC miners even) and some try to spin it that if it's coming from miners, then why should non-miners oppose.

"I'm not opposed to trying new ideas but I assign a low probability of success to all of this.

Look at the fundraiser last year. It created an enormous amount of drama. The level of complaining from the community was close to being on par with this debacle. People were threatening to ragequit even back then and it was voluntary donations.

And despite a mentally exhausting several months it only raised enough for about two full time developers.

The problem I see are two fold:

1. The community by and large doesn't believe there's anything wrong with the current state of development and don't want to give any more money. The general sentiment seems to be that developers are entitled whiny brats and why do you need more development anyway when the coin is already running? See actual comment: ""DOGE hasn't had development for a long time, yet was one of the best performing crypto last year.""
2. There are three groups that have benefited the most from BCH ― Miners, exchanges, and whales. With the exception of Roger, nobody out of those groups has show any initiative in funding BCH. If all the developers just left and BCH crashed and burned, the exchanges would just delist it and not bat an eyelash. Why do they care? They have plenty of other coins to collect fees from. Now if every coin threatened to go galt until the exchanges coughed up then you would see them open their wallets really quick. But that's never going to happen. And who the hell even knows who these whales are that have these huge BCH balances. They just sit on it and seem oblivious to anything going on in the coin.

So, you say this as a joke, and sure, I get the joke, but... Isn't this what actually happened?

Hmmm. Here's what I saw when I saw Bitcoin. I saw a system which was definitely not ready for prime time but with a natural incentive to self-improve. In this system change is very difficult, because consensus for change gets harder to achieve the bigger the change is. However, any change with enough consensus is possible. This means that the system is essentially plastic, with consensus.

I can also imagine that scenario.  Although only in pretty extraordinary circumstances and after trying everything short of that.

>in the following decades we could learn more about the economics of our currency and decide that its simply economically preferable to increase inflation simply because the benefits to holders outweigh the costs

Yeah, that one I really don't find very plausible.  

>In any case the point is this: you are beginning with the assumption that any change to the inflation schedule is perforce an attack, and then drawing similarities in order to call other changes ""attacks."" 

Not exactly. I'm beginning with the assumption that certain strong Schelling points (coin supply, inflation schedule, miners owning all of the block reward) are VERY fundamental and important and we shouldn't begin fucking with them absent an EXTREMELY compelling reason for doing so.  And as much I'd like to see Feline AIDS cured, or Amaury get a ski chalet in Aspen, I just don't think we're there yet.

EDIT: How about this? You can imagine (as I can) a future scenario in which it *might* make sense to increase the 21-million coin supply. (At least I can imagine such a scenario decades in the future.) But if this dev funding proposal *had* been funded by a ""one-time"" issuance of new coins to increase the 21 million supply cap by 0.07% or whatever (and for the sake of argument, let's imagine that there were a ""clean"" way for the hash rate majority to do that via a soft fork), how (if at all) would your feelings about that proposal differ from the one actually presented?

What about, instead of ""extra future inflation"" it was funded by pulling forward future inflation? Keep the 21M limit, but increase short term inflation? 

This is basically what happened (unintentionally?) during the BCH/BTC split, which BCH is slowly recovering from. On November 14 2017, (the day after the EDA was replaced) BCH block height was 504,203, BTC's was 494,387. Today BCH's height is 619,957, and BTC's is 615,063.

">Coin supply and inflation remain the same, who receives an eighth of it, is different.

Yes, obviously. The argument is that it's a similar violation.  As I wrote in the article:

If *that* [funding development via increase in coin supply] had been the proposal, people would have lost their shit—and rightly so! They'd say: ""No way! The 21-million-coin limit is a fundamental part of the protocol. It’s part of what you might call Bitcoin’s ‘social contract.’ That's a bright red line that shouldn't be crossed."" Well, I'm suggesting that the same is true of the protocol rule that says that the coinbase reward—the *full* coinbase reward—belongs to the miner who mines that block. Indeed, the two are closely related. Investors who bought into Bitcoin did so with the understanding that they were buying into a coin with a certain fixed supply and a certain inflation schedule, and moreover with the understanding that that inflation—*all* of that inflation—would be directed towards incentivizing the chain’s hash rate security (while adoption would hopefully be growing massively over the years, thereby enabling transaction fees to shoulder an increasingly large share of the security burden as the block subsidy diminished over time).

Diverting an 1/8th of that inflation away from incentivizing hash rate security (even if it's being diverted towards a ""super important good cause"") represents a fundamental violation of that understanding that's similar in severity to an increase in the coin supply.";7;2;False;Capt_Roger_Murdock;ffw6lnp;"The ""Dev Tax"" proposal is worse than I thought (and I thought it was pretty bad)";evh02e;https://read.cash/@Roger_Murdock/the-dev-tax-proposal-is-worse-than-i-thought-and-i-thought-it-was-pretty-bad-20d2d5e0

>this is little different than changing the coin supply or inflation schedule

I definitely agree. Comparing this proposal with one funded by an increase in the coin supply: in both cases, holders are being forced to pay -- although the form of the payment is different (i.e., dilution of their holdings via extra, unanticipated inflation in the latter case vs. an unanticipated reduction in the amount of hash rate security they're ""buying"" for the same amount of inflation in the former).  Either case to me represents a fundamental violation of Bitcoin's basic ""social contract"" with earlier investors.  

>this is a 51% attack if the miners do it even though the proceeds might go to our friends

Well, *I* think it's fair to characterize it that way. Although as I've said before, a ""51% attack"" is just a label for a particularly destructive majority-hash-rate-implemented ""soft fork."" In my view at least, this proposal exists on a part of the spectrum where reasonable minds can differ as to whether the label is justified.

You know, that's actually a great observation. Speaking purely in the abstract, a current 12.5% reduction in hashpower probably IS more dangerous / harmful for BCH at this time, than the effect of an equivalent amount of extra future inflation. Again, speaking purely in the abstract!

"Thanks for taking the time to respond. However your response stuffed full with extremely false claims which are provided without any supporting evidence (as none exists).

> a banking conglomerate

Blockstream was not funded by any banking companies while I was there. There was an VC arm of an insurance company that was a minority investor, however.

> a vast information warfare campaign

I am a a vast information warfare campaign?  I should be flattered I guess, but it's not true.

> implemented deeply unpopular protocol changes to suit Blockstream's private products,

Not so. If these protocol changes existed you would be able to link to them specifically rather than just vaguely suggest them. They do not.

>  buying out and censoring /bitcoin and bitcointalk.org,

r/bitcoin and bitcointalk are run by theymos same as they long have.  To the extent that any financial relationship has ever existed between theymos or any org that I've been associated with it's only been in the form of theymos paying *me*, never the other way around.

> rampant vote manipulation of public forums like Reddit using bot farms that you own

I, nor anyone I've worked with has ever operated such a thing as far as I've ever been able to determine. Nor is there any reason for you to claim as much except to spread a malicious falsehood.  (In fact, when I worked at blockstream we had an explicit company policy to request employees not get involved in Bitcoin drama under non-public alternative names.)

> flying to China and lying to miners face to face, 

I've never been to china.  Some other developers I know were invited there by miners after they complained about Jgarzik flying to china and telling outright falsehoods to miners. I declined to attend and successfully encouraged many others to not do so because I thought it was likely to result in drama and I didn't believe it would be proper especially considering the different expectations that exist owing to cultural differences.

> making bullshit ""agreements""

Similarly. The only thing I've done relevant to this allegation has been aggressively calling out bullshit like that. What ""agreement"" do you believe I was ever party to?

> 24/7 gaslighting and FUD campaigns that continue to this day against BCH, much of it coming directly from you and your sockpuppets.

This is the only account I use to talk about Bitcoin stuff on reddit, there are no sockpuppets. I am almost completely earnest in my communication here, no gaslighting.  (Occasionally, not 100% earnest because jesus christ it's an abusive mad house around here-- sometimes you just have to find a way to laugh at it to survive it.)   Ironically, many of the people most loudly accused of being my ""sockpuppets"" are freeking BCH supporters that just made the mistake of being epsilon more technically competent than the average poster. 

> You keep coming here and lying your fat bearded ass off, 

I'm here. Not lying. But on the fat part, you've got me there.

> The rest of your posse of pussies like Samson, Tone, Jimmy, etc are just as bad.

I don't believe I've ever communicated with Tone. I believe I've only exchanged a couple messages with Jimmy when he submitted improvements to the Bitcoin software. It looks like my only communication with Samon since leaving Blockstream two years ago was to send him a friendly note a few months ago sending him some well wishes after I saw him getting some abusive treatment in public.  So much for my ""posse"".

"hello Greg,

That's a complex question, and I'll do my best to answer it.

First of all, I don't believe I've ever actually ""harrassed"" you, or another other developer, perhaps outside of an occasional meme or something.  Let's not confuse harrassment (however you define that) with legimate petitioning of grievances from the users to the developers.

The ossification of the BTC protocol away from peer-to-peer electronic cash (in the obvious ways everyone knows about) is something that I consider tragic.  That's a strong word but that's how important and powerful Bitcoin is, IMO.  

Certainly the developers are not 100% responible.  They could have not done that without exchanges, miners, users, etc.  However, this does not mean Bitcoin Core isn't culpable for the direction Bitcoin took.  They are, and they intended that direction.

I'm sure you have your reasons for your actions and I'm also sure you can understand why many people were very upset about what happened for a long time.  I'm passed that and I'm working on Bitcoin Cash.";8;2;False;jonald_fyookball;ffvvmm3;You lost me MEMORYDEALERS;evbyqk;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/evbyqk/you_lost_me_memorydealers/
">can you explain your years of harassment directed at myself and the developers of bitcoin software?

Oh that's easy: you guys proved yourselves hostile, incompetent, unprofessional, 4chan troll dumbass little sociopaths with bad ideas powered by a big bankroll.

You started a private company that got funded by a banking conglomerate by using your position with Core, and Adam's clout being named in the whitepaper. You used those resources to launch a vast information warfare campaign and implemented deeply unpopular protocol changes to suit Blockstream's private products, like Liquid, based on Elements that you personally laid the initial groundwork for in 2015. 

You deployed every mindfuck game in the book to get what you wanted, including: buying out and censoring /bitcoin and bitcointalk.org, rampant vote manipulation of public forums like Reddit using bot farms that **you own**, flying to China and lying to miners face to face, making bullshit ""agreements"",  and 24/7 gaslighting and FUD campaigns that continue to this day against BCH, much of it  coming directly from *you* and your sockpuppets.

You, Greg, turn everything you touch to *dogshit*. You keep coming here and lying your fat bearded ass off, and switch between multiple accounts and even talk to yourself like a psyco. The rest of your posse of pussies like Samson, Tone, Jimmy, etc are just as bad.

Nah, can't imagine why **everyone fucking hates you and your scumbag associates**. Why do you even come here but to be a piece of shit?

> ""...hold an entry on that ledger, what is the probability that the entry is valid on the successful crypto we're imagining exists in 20 years.""

He's implying that he doesn't think BCH ledger entries will exist [on the solely successful crypto] **as it won't be valid.**

The way he worded his comment implies that there will only be one successful crypto. And if you analyze his holdings, which is 97% in BTC for philosophical reasons and not for temporary TA reasons, then it's obvious that in his mind the chance of BTC being this solely successful crypto is 97% and the chance for BCH being the solely successful crypto is 3%.

>I said ""the ledger currently called X"" because what it is called doesn't matter. I mean if you currently hold an entry on that ledger, what is the probability that the entry is valid on the successful crypto we're imagining exists in 20 years.

He *asks a question* that asks you to assume that SOME globally-adopted crypto will exist in 20 years.  He then explains why he worded the question in the way he did and what he meant by that question.  Nowhere in the excerpted text you've provided does he state that it's his own view that BCH will likely not exist in 20 years.

"using a bit of split coins is indeed a good way to separate the twin coins. You would then still need to then recover the BSV after that. This can be done using Electrum SV as it can work with the ledger wallet (just like Electron Cash) without your keys ever leaving your Ledger. So your keys would remain secure. 

Also, as long as you send coins to wallet addresses you hold the keys or pass phrase for, you will to lose any coins. You can in that case recover your coins. Even if it is a bit fiddly and seems daunting at times. 

In general you can use [blockchair.com](https://blockchair.com) to see which coins moved on which chain as it shows both. Aways good to send coins that stayed behind after a split to a new (but different ) address also to make absolutely sure the coins are indeed split and no mistakes were made that could cause delayed replay.

">Sorry but the 2 situations are nothing alike. A miner can still profit whether the value of a coin decrease or increase

Lol OK I'll give you an example here. how am I going to profit in a bear market? Let's say I bought asics in 2018 at the beginning of it. Thousands of dollars spent in hardware and infrastructure. I start mining, profit goes down in the following two years, until the day that I pay more in electricity, network and collocation costs than I get for the mined coins.
So how do I make profit here? The alternatives to BCH is to switch to BTC. Great. Btc is down to half of what it was worth in 2018 as well. My monthly costs for electricity etc are remaining as high as they were in 2018. Where exactly is the profit?

When you mine, there is a fix price you have to pay every single day of the month. You either make profit if you get more coins out than you need to pay for these fixed costs, or you mine at a loss. There is no profit when you make a loss, there is just bills every month and the realisation that for that money you could have bought so many more coins on the market instead of throwing it at the electric company.

Sure, the miner can just mine part time. But I cannot rent space part time. I cannot get a fix Internet connection part time. I won't get money back for the hardware if I use it only part time. Mining part time means needing even longer to pay off all the bills.

The dev can take an unrelated job and spend just an hour for coding on Bitcoin in his spare time. The only cost he has for coding for Bitcoin is his time, and the price for that time he sets himself.

"The business model of the dev is to actively work on increasing the value of the coin he decides to work on and profit from that increased value. 

If he is smart he invests in the coin beforehand (like a miner), then starts developing for it, and waits to pay himself out from the gain in price that the coin will experience after his code has been implemented into the protocol.

Like a miner he can pay himself out during the process of coding, or if he can afford it, he holds the coins until a bubble.

So the same rules that apply for miners also apply for developers. They both do their part to benefit from an increased price of the coin. The difference being that the miners invests in hardware while the developer invests his own time.

A miner invests in more hardware to increase his profit. A developer invests in more coins and time instead.

"> It isn't wages because it isn't being paid by the consumer of the service. 

That logic is flawed. Here is a simple example to show this:  
Reddit and Facebook are also not paid for by the consumer of the service. Yet nobody will conclude that they are subsidized services. The pay to do a service does not have to come directly from the consumer. It can be indirectly.

> It's being paid for through inflation, and is therefore socialized, 

You seem to misunderstand the difference between a social framework and business economics.

A social system, like most modern governments are, tax everyone. You can't escape it. Money ""made"" that way being ""given"" to people are subsidies.

The block reward can be seen as inflation, but this inflation is only going to affect those that hold the coin. You have a choice. Just like any business deal you can weigh the pro's and con's and buy or not buy. That makes this business economics. This is relevant because business per definition is not a monopoly. Multiple chains compete. You can choose to not use any.


To bring this to its natural conclusion, imagine you have two coins. One that includes a social tax to pay unknown people decided by a central body, and one chain that empowers people completely via the free market. Which do you think is going to be the most valuable for holders and miners?

Even the ABC people have all stated clearly that the one without the tax is the more profitable, and that is why they insisted on the orphaning.

So, regardless of your conviction of this being a socialism based subsidy or not, the free market doesn't like those and has in fact massively stood up voting against it.

"Nice job Chris, you're always one of the most rational and intelligent voices in crypto! Regarding:

>Did (Satoshi) plan to stay around as lead maintainer forever? Did he plan on  using his 1M coins to partially finance development? Did he assume the  early developers would get rich enough from early participation that  developers could self finance themselves? I

My guess would be that Satoshi had no idea Bitcoin would explode like it has. He likely thought it would remain a fringe hobbyist project for many years. And early devs *did* get quite rich from Bitcoin, no? 

Finally I wish to point out that someday *development will end*. Not because the software is perfect, but it's good enough. Not because people don't want more features, but because adding features risks the stability of the network. This is something that devs don't want to face. The code is their baby, and they will never believe it's good enough.

The developers for BCH are all people looking to take advantage of an opportunity.

Development for BTC is simply working on the primary chain with the longest accumulated PoW. The one which is secure.

Programmers (actual programmers not people who pretend to be programmers in the initial /r/btc circlejerk creation), generally understand *Proof of Work* and see the risk involved with a minority fork. 

They realise it's a path which goes nowhere and sinking time into that would be wasted life. Programming is too much mental effort to just throw away. You might not need funding, but you certainly don't need the risk of your work becoming irrelevant too quickly.

I just commented on this in another thread but wanted to comment here. The [block reward](https://bitcoin.org/en/glossary/block-reward) is composed of two parts: the fees, and the block subsidy. 

The block subsidy is not pay for work done. The fee is pay for work done. The block subsidy is paid for through inflation, and therefore socialized, ie a subsidy. That's why it's called a block subsidy.

"I agreed that maintenance work needs a plan also. Here is an example of a product support and maintenance work:

1. Scope of works: a) Anything related to the current features that do not work as intended and require a fix b) Security related R&D activities to ensure the network is secured against attack including penetration testing, hotfixes... c) Roadmapped items: minor enhancements or low priority bugs that are not urgently needed d) Some mandatory updates such as OS upgrades (Linux, MacOS, Windows, Raspbian ), API upgrade - similar to Core codebase upgrade, etc....
2. SLA: All issues in scope will be triaged to a predefined level, e.g. L1 - immediate HF is needed, L2 - fix in next immediate release; L3 - Roadmapped to future releases.
3. Performance reports - every month or so, there should be a report on how many tickets the team supported/delivered, and number of hours spent on each ticket (new or roadmapped), so this is transparent to all stakeholders on performance of the team
4. Change requests: if any new feature that is out of the team's capacity AND scope, it must be raised as a change request. There must be a budget raised to fund for new change requests so that the team can add new capacity to support change requests given the expected timeline. This is also included in the performance report as well.

"Last time we used anything but Nakamoto consensus, users gained nothing, miners gained nothing and Blockstream finally gained a surface to built a product on. They showed us that developers (Bitcoin Core) can be captured and can override miners and users. There's no checks and balances.

Imo the only group that should be able to vote and lead are the ones with skin in the game, ie the miners. Should they push an agenda that hurts the image, value or technological advantage they'll pay for it. Users for the most part and private companies can move to another blockchain with lesser consequences, so they don't have incentives or disincentives to do what's right for the blockchain, just themselves.

"I love this idea. It might need a custodian to decide when the milestone is accomplished and who earned the payout (likely BitcoinABC but not necessarily). Maybe also a mechanism so the donors can just stake the funds but keeps the private keys until it is announced completed, then transfers the funds. A company like Coinbase could put up payouts assured with only their reputation, small donations might need some kind of escrow (again would need a custodian to decide whether it's returned or pushed forward).

"Cool. Thanks for the wikipedia definition. 

Now... I ask... does that definition include the reality of Bitcoin and PoW? 

Below I understand my analogies and examples may not be perfect, but I also do not believe that Bitcoin/PoW is perfectly represented by an outdated definition of cartel.

It is the PoW aspect that makes mining pools a cartel, IMO. Mining pools are: 

* **a group of independent market participants**

A mining pool is a group of independent miners

* **who collude with each other**

OK.. maybe collude is not the correct word, but they are working together for THEIR benefit. That others benefit from their working together is immaterial, IMO. 

* **in order to improve their profits**

(I could be wrong, I have not looked into mining or mining pools in many years, if the process has changed drastically... <shrugs shoulders>)

An individual miner (meaning one individual legal entity and the total amount of SHA256 hash they control) mining on their own is insignificant (usually). The amount of time and the costs associated with that time, mining solo, may be so great that the solo miner could not afford to mine.

Ming on a pool improves their profits, changing the profit from maybe a week, month, months, a year or more down the road because they got lucky and found a block | to a steady, but smaller, stream of income. 

There is NO promise that because you mine that you will EVER find a block. The mining pool changes that proposition.

* **and dominate the market** 

As of right now, due to previous mining pools getting close to, if not exceeding 51% (I am thinking of GHASH.IO) mining pools restrict their public size to *less than*. *Less than* the amount that could be pointed at the pool. 

A mining pool that captures, for whatever reason, 51%+ mining hash of a chain's PoW(Bitcoin PoW)... can then create whatever rules it wants, orphan the blocks of other miners (for whatever reason), or other things I am not immediately aware of.

* **Cartel behavior includes price fixing,**

Mining pools charge their members fees so that the members can point their hash at it. (this probably does not apply)

The 'price fixing' is fixed at the immediate price, or near immediate price, of the mined block through cooperation of adding all the hash of individual members together, instead of each member mining on their own and maybe finding a block 1 year or so later.

* **bid rigging**,

bids could be anagolous to finding the nonce(?). The more members of the pool equate to an easier chance of rigging the bid.

* **and reductions in output**.

How much would it cost EACH individual, and the hash they control, to mine solo? How long would EACH individual miner take to find a block and reap the reward? How many solo miners could afford those costs until they found a block and reward?

> I don't see that a mining pool necessarily engages in price fixing, bid rigging or reductions in output.

See above.

> I think a mining pool (or colluding group of pools) that used it's dominant hash power to deliberately orphan valid blocks would be an example of this behaviour,

I agree. That is besides the point though.

Sure they are. But this change would have changed something fundamental about the nature of the currency and which partners were at play. If this proposal or proposal like it is to succeed in the future I think a few changes will need to be made:

* No Counterpary, donations go direct from Coinbase to Devs without a counterparty.
* 0.5% instead of 12.5%. This is a revenue tax. 12.5% of **revenue** is a non-trivial tax rate (yes I understand that compulsory payments under the threat of financial harm are things some people only see as a tax if there's an government involved and that's why HOA payments and the Cartel systems aren't taxes per se but this system has all the characteristics of a tax and tax is really the most charitable correlate in the legacy financial system)

But the nodes using NODEorg would reject 101new. It would not exist for them. So they would continue to mine on top of 100:

"Segwit eliminated the blocksize limit and replaced it with a weight limit. Weight measures transaction resource usage differently-- like measuring orange juice in kilograms instead of in liters.

The weight based limit better reflects long term costs... e.g. UTXO database which is frequently accessed, vs signature data which is never accessed by a running node once a block is accepted other than to pass it along to new nodes syncing up.

"> I agree with that but would add that while it's immediately clear when you're buying less beer, it's not clear what it means to buy less hashing security. How much security do we need and why should it be linearly proportional to the price of BCH?

Well, I think it's clear what you're buying, it's just not clear whether you ""need"" it / how much marginal value it will provide. After all, as you put it: ""How much security do we need?"" Well that's hard to say other than in hindsight. You find out after the fact if you didn't have enough. (I actually find beer to be kinda similar. Sometimes I'll think ""man, I need another beer,"" and then like an hour later or sometimes the next morning, I'll discover that no, I actually *really* did NOT need another beer.) More seriously though, I think that's a big reason this proposal is so insidious.  At first glance it looks like the *miners* have gotten together and agreed to fund development, but really the payment comes (mostly) from holders. (SHA256 miners do take a small hit collectively as a result of the reduction in the total pooled value of competitively mined coins.) And the nature of the holders' payment is such that it can be easy to overlook. Because, yeah, we *probably* wouldn't miss the diverted hash rate. It *probably* wouldn't be the difference between a 51% attack succeeding when it otherwise would have failed. But now imagine that the proposal had holders pay more transparently in the form of a ""one-time-only-never-to-be-repeated-we-promise"" increase in Bitcoin Cash's 21 million coin supply. It'd be ""tiny"" (a 0.07% increase would yield $6 million at current prices -- wasn't that the target raise?). ""Holders *probably* won't even notice  such a piddling effective reduction in their holdings. And anyways, they'll *probably* be more than compensated for it by the price appreciation that will flow from the improved software."" If *that* were the proposal, people would lose their shit and rightly so. They'd say: ""No way! The 21 million coin limit is a fundamental part of the protocol. That's a bright red line that shouldn't be crossed."" Well, I'm suggesting that the same is true of the protocol rule that says that the coinbase reward--the *full* coinbase reward--belongs to the miner who finds it.

>And when Peter says that the investors are paying it would have been helpful to add (like you made clear) that they are paying for it instead of for some fraction of security. Because now it seems like he's saying they're paying additionally.

Yeah, I agree that the article could have been clearer on this point. But I don't think Peter was trying to hide the ball or anything.

For example, a Script that wants to perform calculations on numbers that represent satoshis would have issues with OP_MUL because an amount of satoshis is about 26 bits so multiplying 2 of them could yield a ~52 bit product.

The cool part is u/eyeofpython hacked it out of the script we've already had, with no protocol updates needed. Until now script people have usually inverted multiplication to use division instead but that leads to issues with precision, and because of scripts 32 integer limits the inverted operation has to fit in this limit and sometimes it's really small. IMO this is the main reason why after a year of OP\_CHECKDATASIG we still don't have any contract using god damn price oracles around. And that was the main thing that OP\_CDS was meant to do!

This is straightforward using the standard addition algorithm. We carry the result and add it to the next.

Nope, the premine narrative was an elaborate ruse designed to take attention away from Dash's many innovations, which were viewed as a threat by other coins such as Monero. We found out quite some time ago that those allegations were bogus. Evan was a great developer, and a visionary. This is backed up by the fact that other coins are just now starting to follow his lead.

"Thanks for the kind words Colin. If you're confused by the hate in this subreddit, it's because a couple of months ago, Amaury and Imaginary Username decided to label me a BSV shill for criticizing them. 

Since there's currently a high level of tribalism - especially among developers - people mindlessly started repeating them, censoring me, and then pretending like I'm some secret bad actor.

It's especially ironic, since my criticism is that the BCH community feels like it's walking down the path to Bitcoin Core 2.0 - because I remember them demonizing and censoring anybody who criticized the devs.

If I had thin skin, I would have left by now, because irrational tribalism means the community is failing. But I'm optimistic that we'll see changes this year. 

I still regularly speak with several prominent members of this community, and they know I'm not a BSV shill and certainly don't deserve mindless attacks.

"Look at it this way. We have a simple goal. Fiat is used for bad stuff, and we want to replace it with something better.

Many altcoins exist. But if we heed the words of every referral guy walking through the front door, pragmatically, where does that leave us? Divided, not working together, unorganized, inefficient, etc ..

So if someone is spending the majority of time on Project B, and we're busy concerning ourself with Project A, are we morally obligated to make them feel like voices of importance in Project A? No, they're free to practice Project B, but maybe that's not relevant to what we're doing, and it wastes our time since we're concerned with Project A.

Nobodys calling Steve or you or Deryk evil, or stupid. But a BCH supporter isn't mostly invested in cryptos that aren't BCH, that's just a normal diversified investor. And that's fine to do. But nobody truly serious about BCH is going to care about your opinion if you aren't aligned to their cause.

>censoring me

Accusing people of censorship.

>pretending like I'm some secret bad actor.

Accusing people of pretending and conspiracy theories.

>since my criticism is that the BCH community feels like it's walking down the path to Bitcoin Core 2.0

You're accusing everyone working their ass off fixing bugs in the protocol, spreading adoption, etc.. as becoming Bitcoin Core 2.0? That's extremely insulting.

>because I remember them demonizing

You're accusing people of demonizing.

>If I had thin skin, I would have left by now,

This is pretty childish. 

>because irrational tribalism means the community is failing.

Accusing us of failing.

>

Seems like arrogance.

>and they know I'm not a BSV shill and certainly don't deserve mindless attacks.

You've already made this point in the form of an accusation.

>I hope they'll start speaking up - even if it upsets Amaury

Once again, calling someone out by name, even though they're not here to defend themself.

**All of this combined, all of these accusations meant to put others down, all 15 of them in this single comment, magnified by the fact that you're only partially invested in BCH and don't really actively contribute in any way that benefits us, can you see why people think of you as toxic?**

Can you see why, when others point this out, and you just say ""Oh your just trying to suppress my opinion because I'm not a part of your club"" that it makes you look like a complete fool?

You're not entitled to other people's time, attention, respect, or anything. This is our house, we have a cause that's important to us.

Glad you are above it and able to simply view the scene rationally, and I sure hope you are right that this year we'll see positive changes and hopefully a reduction in the toxic tribalism.

Keep in mind that some of the toxicity is intentional (I'm sure you are aware of this), designed to push away good people. That is actually the sign that Bitcoin Cash is doing something right. The proof of this test is that its very existence is a threat. Otherwise it would simply be ignored.

However, I disagree with you that BCH will become Bitcoin Core 2.0. Mainly because the miners are edging towards non-debate theory and letting their actions speak for themselves. They will not be swayed by the voices here if they are unreasonable now.

Besides that, I do expect BTC to crumble and BSV to become the new attack coin. From an investment POV BSV hedges BCH better than BTC does.

yeah, a bunch of silver/gold merchs accept Crypto.

&#x200B;

Here's the funny part: you can only use BCH because of low fees and ZERO conf. (It immediately confirms after you click 'purchase' -- like **IMMEDIATELY**)

Tried BTC last May, but it had $5 fees, but that's not even the F-ed up part... You only have 10 mins window to lock in your price. So without Zero conf, **my BTC did not confirm in time lol** (I had to contact support... it took a while to get it fixed)

I supported BTC before that, but after that stupid crap, Im done with it.

&#x200B;

Other sites accept ethereum too. But just an advice: do it fast, cause once I was too slow and there was only 4 mins left (price lock down), ETH wasnt able to confirm on time (and I had to contact support again which took em days to fix)

Maybe Bitcoin Cash can be successful with either system, but if we go by history, competition is the only true check on people's behavior. Competition not only among cryptocurrencies, but also among developers and ideas. And p2p proposal funding is in my opinion the best way to achive that.

The original dev fund proposal had several vulnerabilities. Is there a protocol-layer solution that has no weak points? Perhaps. But once it becomes Law, there will be actors trying to corrupt it, and it better be perfect. As Bastiat said,

"Yes, I think you're spot on with characterizing 1 as a ""side effect."" Here's an analogy I wrote in convo with another guy who was suggesting that fund would be paid by electric companies as a result of the reduced demand for electricity the proposal would cause.  

Right now, holders ""pay"" for inflation and in exchange they get a certain amount of hash rate security that depends on coin price (and to a much lesser extent, transaction volume and fees). This proposal would result in holders getting *less* hash rate / security for a given coin price because some fraction of the coinbase reward that had been incentivizing hash rate / security would instead be diverted to the Hong Kong company.  So I think holders would be the ones ""paying."" Electric companies might be *affected* by the resulting reduction in demand for their product, but I think it'd be odd to say they're the ones ""paying"" for the proposal. It's like you've got a club that budgets $1000 a month for refreshments and they decide to switch from spending all $1000 on beer and start spending some of it (e.g., $125) on sodas. Would you say that the beer companies are the ones ""paying"" for the soda? SHA256 miners are kind of in the position of beer companies in my analogy -- although they're also the ones capable of voting on the proposal to divert some funds to soda.  And actually, maybe to make the analogy better, we should replace ""soda"" with ""funding for scientific research to improve beer brewing technology."" Club members still get less beer in the short term although supporters of the proposal might argue that they'll get more beer in the long-term if the research leads to technological breakthroughs in brewing technology that reduce the cost of manufacture. And maybe they'll also get more beer in the short term because the club members in this analogy are actually all stakeholders in the beer company and the successful adoption of the proposal will immediately raise market confidence in the beer company's long-term prospects, increasing the value of the members' stock, and giving them the ability to afford more beer immediately.";2;0;False;Capt_Roger_Murdock;ffwzx6y;I Like The Moloch DAO Structure - I'll Tribute 100BCH For BCH related projects if 99 Others Do The Same;evh360;https://memberapp.github.io/?ee96#article?post=ee96a2a596

"Ha, well, I don't really think it was a fair summary, but just because I like you, I'll elaborate on why. 

>I believe it boils down to 'it will lower hash rate' making the coin less valuable to holders even if the price does not fall 

Sort of. Yes, it will divert some fraction of the coin base reward away from incentivizing hash rate and that's a cost that will be borne by the holders of the currency in the form of reduced security.  The point is that the costs are not really being paid by the miners, but by the holders in the form of reduced security. I pointed out that if the proposal had instead had holders pay more transparently in the form of an increase in the 21 million coin supply limit, people would have (rightly!) lost their minds. I further argued that the actual proposal and my hypothetical one are not only similar in that holders are the ones who pay -- but also in that they both violate Bitcoin's ""social contract"" surrounding coin supply, inflation schedule, and what that temporary inflation was intended to pay for (hash rate security).

>If we do this thing that is good for BCH, we are sure to go crazy and do terrible things due to the slippery slope

I don't think it would be ""good for BCH"" for reasons outlined in Peter Rizun's article. But yes, there is a ""slippery slope"" aspect to my argument.

" \>The point is that the costs are not really being paid by the miners, but by the holders in the form of reduced security. 

This is the same argument I made in criticism of  Emin Gün Sirer summary of consequences. He overlooked who was actually paying the cost and the fact hashrate would decrease by roughly 12.5% not a small amount.

I'm in full agreement with you.

I was not actually defending his position, he's made a summary taking a mental shortcut to belittle the consequences. I was saying if one overlooks your explanation then that could be a conclusion.

Sure, that'd be the argument.

But note that you could try to make that argument for a lot of things. Maybe we should divert some fraction of the coinbase reward to fund marketing and promotion efforts. Maybe we should force the miners to simply burn some fraction of the coinbase reward (or equivalently, soft fork to a reduced coinbase reward / inflation schedule, thereby reducing the currently-planned 21MM coin limit). Sure we'd get a little less hash rate security but again, how much do we need?

No. What you posted is literally him asking a question and then explaining why he worded part of the question in the way he did / what he meant by that question.  

>and it's his view that BCH is more high risk than BTC (which he did say, and I said in my original comment since I couldn't fit it in my screenshot)

And that's the part you left out?! The one where he expresses an actual opinion? And you instead provide a screenshot of him asking a question? But ok, I'll take your word for it and assume he's said that BCH is more high risk than BTC. And? BCH is currently trading at 4% the price of BTC and doing a fraction of its transaction volume (despite much greater transactional capacity). Peter believes in the original Bitcoin vision of massive scaling and cheap, fast, and reliable p2p cash. But that doesn't mean that BCH is guaranteed to emerge as the winner (or even that it's more likely than BTC to do so).  Here's how I've summarized my own opinions on this question before:

People seem to lose sight of the fact that the value of any cryptocurrency today is almost entirely speculative. When you buy BTC or BCH (or Dogecoin or anything else for that matter), what you're *really* buying is an entry on a *ledger*. That ledger is associated with a current protocol (i.e., a set of Schelling points that define how that ledger is updated). But that protocol can change over time. Moreover, (as we've obviously seen on several occasions) a multiplicity of protocols may end up carrying a ledger (as of a particular point) forward. The nature of money is such that you want to hold a piece of the ledger that you think that ""everyone else"" will want to hold in the future (and of course they'll have the same goal). BTC's current protocol might be very sub-par, but the fact remains that it's still the market leader with the largest market cap, the chain with the strongest ""brand,"" the (at-least perceived) ""original"" cryptocurrency, the chain with the most proof-of-work, and the chain with the most infrastructure support. That makes it a VERY strong Schelling point for the market to ultimately converge on (although it will *eventually* have to unfuck its protocol and actually deliver on the promised potential that cryptocurrency offers). BCH on the other hand launched as a rebranded (new ticker, new name), minority hash-rate spinoff that made wallet-breaking changes to its transaction format and difficulty adjustment algorithm. In doing so, it sacrificed a huge chunk of its network effect (reflected not only by its substantially lower price but also by its still rather anemic transaction count). Its network effect took a further hit with the messy BSV split. BCH obviously hopes to rebuild its network effect, but there's no guarantee that effort will be successful and the past two years aren't exactly uniformly encouraging in that respect.

> And if you analyze his holdings, which is 97% in BTC for philosophical reasons and not for temporary TA reasons, then it's obvious that in his mind the chance of BTC being this solely successful crypto is 97% and the chance for BCH being the solely successful crypto is 3%.

Well, I'm not privy to the man's holdings.  But if memory serves, I believe he's said he owns more BCH in coin terms than BTC, but the value of the latter is greater (which, given the huge gap in value between the two, only implies that he doesn't have more than 25 times as many BCH coins). I believe he's also said that he thinks BCH is undervalued relative to his view of its prospects.  That's my own view as well. Holding more BCH coins than BTC coins implies that he'd profit more by BCH emerging as the winning ledger. Not going ""all in"" on BCH has served him (and me) pretty well over the past few years. But no, he doesn't think that BCH has a 100% chance of becoming the global ledger of tomorrow. Neither do I.

No person in their right mind would willingly sacrifice 97% of their holdings under the assumption of ""hey, if the 3% happens to be right, I'll still have the same number of coins or greater"", without thoroughly not believing whatsoever in the 3%. That's banking on BCH less than I would bank on BSV, honestly. If I invested in BSV id go to around 5-10% at least.

">Wow. And you're calling yourself a BCH supporter after basically calling it a cheap spin-off?

Well, yes, it was launched as a ""spin-off."" Again, it was forced to rebrand and make wallet-breaking changes, and in doing so, it sacrificed a huge chunk of its network effect. And sadly, it is ""cheap"" for now compared to the still much larger, more dominant chain. That doesn't mean it can't ultimately emerge as the winning, most-worked Bitcoin chain -- and eventually reclaim the ""Bitcoin""-sans-modifiers ""brand"" in the eyes of the world. I hope it does. That would make me richer.  

>You don't think a lot has happened in the last two years?

Sure. Not all of it's good unfortunately. And frankly, I view the transaction volume as more alarming than the price action.  It looks to me like BCH is currently averaging around 50,000 tx /day. The then-undivided Bitcoin chain began consistently exceeding that level sometime around January 2014. That's six years ago! Even if you remain optimistic about BCH's long-term prospects, don't fail to understand just how badly its network effect suffered as a result of the minority fork path it took.

>Yeah, it's like 97% of it.

You got a citation for that figure? The only way you get 97% of value in BTC (at current prices) is if you hold more BTC coins than BCH coins. If you held the two coins 1:1 in coin terms (and had no BSV or any other crypto), that would only get you to 96% value in BTC.

>I don't because I'm not here to make money, but to serve p2p cash, which BTC does not do

BTC certainly doesn't do it very well in its current form but again, that could change in the future.  I love the goal of p2p cash. That's why I got into Bitcoin almost eight years ago and well, yeah, also to get rich. The good news for you is that (in my opinion at least) p2p cash is a tremendously valuable thing and thus one good way to become richer, at least in the long-run, is to successfully predict which chain will ultimately best serve that purpose. I guess you're 100% convinced it will be the BCH chain. I'm not.

">Well, yes, it was launched as a ""spin-off."" 

No, it was launched as The Real Bitcoin. We failed to secure that branding, but this is the historically accurate analysis, not us intentionally being a spin-off.

We lost some bsv supporters and price went down slightly. Where is all the bad things that you've think to have happened?

Don't you think our whole point is to turn that around? Can you understand why it's upsetting when people like Peter who aren't invested in BCH and imply that it will probably never succeed or might even die tell others how to feel and think? He's got no authority here, he's borderline like Greg Maxwell running around trying to imply that his opinions matter here, Peter is just generally more respectful about it.

>You got a citation for that figure? 

I'm not going to entertain you wanting a citation for an exact number on something extremely volatile and violently fluctuating.

">No, it was launched as The Real Bitcoin. We failed to secure that branding, but this is the historically accurate analysis, not us intentionally being a spin-off.

Whether it's historically accurate remains to be seen. In some ways, I'd agree that Bitcoin Cash does have a better claim to being the ""real"" Bitcoin i.e., in the sense that its efforts to preserve Bitcoin's original characteristics as fast, cheap, and reliable, ""peer-to-peer electronic cash"" are more consistent with the whitepaper than BTC's movement towards becoming a high-friction settlement network / ""digital gold."" But unfortunately, Bitcoin BTC has more hash power and that also gives it a strong claim to being the ""real"" Bitcoin as defined in the white paper, notwithstanding the current gross mismanagement of that chain's protocol.  Bitcoin Cash was intentionally launched as a ""spin-off"" at least in the sense that the nature of its forking changes reflected the fact that the parties behind it knew that it would be, at least initially, the minority hash-rate chain.

>We lost some bsv supporters and price went down slightly. Where is all the bad things that you've think to have happened?

The price is 4% that of BTC's, and transaction volume is at a level Bitcoin first crossed six years ago. ""It's just a flesh wound."" 

>Don't you think our whole point is to turn that around?

Of course, and again, I very much hope we'll be successful in those efforts. 

>Can you understand why it's upsetting when people like Peter who aren't invested in BCH

Peter IS invested in BCH. I get that you'd like him to put all of his assets into BCH and maybe max out his credit cards and take out a second mortgage. For selfish reasons, I suppose I'd like that too. I'd *really* like it if we could get Jeff Bezos to go 100% BCH.  I don't suppose you two are on friendly terms? Maybe you could nudge him in that direction?

>and imply that it will probably never succeed or might even die tell others how to feel and think?

It might die.  And I don't think he's telling anyone how to feel or think. He's simply expressing his, in my opinion, very well-reasoned opinions on various subjects -- as are we all.

>He's got no authority here

I don't think he would attempt to claim any ""authority."" Although individuals are certainly free to give his opinions more weight if they think he's proven himself to be an intelligent and clear thinker in the past.  

>I'm not going to entertain you wanting a citation for an exact number on something extremely volatile and violently fluctuating.

I understand the exact number in dollar terms will fluctuate. I simply want to know the source you used for your specific claim that he was 97% invested in BTC. Can you not provide that? If the source expresses the ratio in dollar terms we can get a rough figure by seeing when it was written and looking at the historical exchange rates. And if the source expresses the ratio in coin terms (i.e., number of BCH coins per BTC coin), then we'll also have the information we want.  

>Even if he was 90% in BTC, that's still enough coupled with his extreme pessimism towards BCH success to prompt the same thoughts, feelings, and discussion that's already been prompted.

">Bitcoin BTC has more hash power

The hashpower isn't relevant to bch as it's on a different chain. The only serious argument being made about BCH being the original bitcoin is harboring the original purpose and community, having extended from the same origin as BTC.



>Bitcoin Cash was intentionally launched as a ""spin-off"" at least in the sense that the nature of its forking changes reflected the fact that the parties behind it knew that it would be, at least initially, the minority hash-rate chain.

The intent wasn't necessarily to be a spin off. That was just the unfortunate consequence.

I don't care if he has a billion dollars in BCH. When you also have a hundred billion dollars in BTC, and you don't do anything with your pot of gold to the benefit of BCH, then I don't understand why I should trust him on anything, as he isn't incentivized to act in the favor of BCH over BTC.

">The hashpower isn't relevant to bch as it's on a different chain.

It's on a different chain because it had a minority of the hash rate. It was launched because the efforts to increase the block size limit via a clean hard-forking ""upgrade"" had failed (and to a lesser extent, because the efforts to prevent the SegWit soft fork shit sandwich from being pushed through also failed.)

>The intent wasn't necessarily to be a spin off. That was just the unfortunate consequence.

It was an unfortunate consequence of the failure to obtain sufficient hash rate support to do a clean hard fork upgrade of BTC.  

>All in the last 2 years? You're making huge exaggerations in order to put down BCH.

The two figures I provided are both accurate and easily verifiable. Are they things that happened in the past 2 years? Well, yes, or rather they're things that *didn't* happen in the past two years. BCH hasn't gained significant ground on BTC in exchange rate terms -- it's mostly lost ground in those terms. And it hasn't significantly recovered transaction volume.

>I don't care if he has a billion dollars in BCH. When you also have a hundred billion dollars in BTC, and you don't do anything with your pot of gold to the benefit of BCH, 

I don't think he has a billion dollars in BCH or a 100 billion in BTC (and I don't know whether he has any gold holdings at all and if so, whether he stores it in a pot).    

>then I don't understand why I should trust him on anything

I don't think anyone is asking you to trust him on anything. Evaluate his arguments on their merits. And by the way, you shouldn't trust anyone else simply because they claim they hold all of their money in BCH. Do you verify such assertions in each case? I suppose you could have them sign a message with a BCH address, but what if they have even larger BTC holdings that they're not telling you about?!

"> The claim that segwit somehow reduces efficiency is just flat out wrong.

It's not so black and white like you paint it.

there are several types of SegWit transcations and some take up more space than a legacy transaction and some less.

Even Veriblock which helped reaise SegWit adoption from 40% to 60% understands this:

https://medium.com/@veriblock/veriblock-adopts-segwit-and-will-now-take-more-space-on-bitcoin-edf11fbb6678

> Paradoxically, this means that VeriBlock will actually take a larger portion of the actual on-disk Bitcoin blockchain, and the same amount of in-block “weight.”

Not to mention the whole reason Bitcoin Core stalled with raising blocksize was because of the irrational fear that syncing a new node would take too long, when in fact disk space is measured in MB's not blockweight.";1;0;False;500239;ffwwwhu;I stand with Freetrader opposition to a hashpower attack fuelled tax scheme on Bcash.;eutnpn;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/eutnpn/i_stand_with_freetrader_opposition_to_a_hashpower/

You are angry because you are posting hateful and insulting comments. But maybe it's just your personality. Attacking LTC is also silly. It's a pure non-tainted bitcoin clone running on a different PoW algorithm and can be used as a backup option if/when the original bitcoin gets temporarily congested again.

Actually I'm the one posting in the Bitcoin Cash sub, because I love Bitcoin Cash. You're the one who comes here to troll Bitcoin Cash lol. Are you going to deny your hate for Bitcoin Cash, which you post every day?

Don't project your actions onto me. Why would I post hate in the subreddit I support? Meanwhile you hate Bitcoin Cash (Don't deny it) and come here to hate. Not sure why you think you can mask your intention at this point lol. I'm pretty sure every regular here has you RES tagged as something colorful.

And calling out Charlie Lee exit scamming and inviting scammers Mr Ilirgashi back into the fold is just 100% fact. I posted the links as proof. You haven't refuted that, because well you can't.

I was able to mine some Bitcoin for a while with ASIC's, used any GPU's for scrypt mining. Then ASIC's started getting hard to get, or with major delays usually because most ASIC's manufacturs were themselves mining on their made hardware and shipping them the moment it became unprofitable. This was the case with Butterfly labs as at one point I purchased several new ASICS and waited over 4+ months with only excuses. Only when I threatened legal action did they refund my money. Soon after the smart ones realized, if you're expecting crypto/Bitcoin to go up, don't waste your time mining and instead just buy the coins instead, which is what I did. The rest is history.

I witnessed 3 bubbles since I got into Bitcoin, and the pattern was clear that any fool should have realized that the manic 3-4 months of crazy pumps don't last. 

You know the Bitcoin Maxi posts about Bitcoin vs altcoins gains and store of value posts? Those are the same idiots counting their net asset value AFTER holding through a bubble.

This may surprise you, but I initially joined /r/btc only because I did not know that /r/bitcoin even exists. You guys are squatting this subreddit and the description at the sidebar is not helping. I couldn't care less about the dedicated BCH subreddits.

> Are you going to deny your hate for Bitcoin Cash, which you post every day?

I'm posting my comments only when ""someone is wrong on the Internet"".

> Meanwhile you hate Bitcoin Cash (Don't deny it) and come here to hate.

By the way, I initially did not see anything wrong with BCH and even defended it because I naively assumed that it's okay to let these guys to attempt scaling to gigabyte blocks. But it quickly turned out that the BCH ideology is built on just badmouthing BTC, while almost no progress is being done on the scaling front.

> And calling out Charlie Lee exit scamming

Haven't you just admitted that you ""exit scammed"" in 2017 too? What is the difference between you and Charlie Lee?

> and inviting scammers Mr Ilirgashi back into the fold is just 100% fact. I posted the links as proof. You haven't refuted that, because well you can't.

All the 2017 newbies say this because they don't understand what happened. When /r/bitcoin censorship started around 2014, most of us moved to /r/btc since there's no censorship here AND we have a public mod log to enforce that. Naturally most support BCH here because it works better than the crippled Bitcoin that /r/bitcoin supports. 

Next time use the search bar on the right to find many pro Bitcoin posts starting in 2014, before you jump to conclusions.

Around the time Bitcoin Cash formed and SegWit2x fell through sentiment shifted and most realized Bitcoin Core was full of shit and Bitcoin Cash was natural path forward. People are still allowed to discuss any Bitcoin fork or even altcoin here without censorship because we keep discussions unhindered. You can talk about Nano, Monero, Litecoin in good or bad lights. I frequently talk about Nano as a potential competitor to BCH, even though at this state it's not ready to stand toe to toe with BCH.

> But it quickly turned out that the BCH ideology is built on just badmouthing BTC, while almost no progress is being done on the scaling front.

I guess you missed the obvious https://i.imgur.com/Nat7YfB.jpg We call this scaling and we're not stopping. Bitcoin Cash ABC clients stands for Adjustable Block Size and the idea is that we don't need to jump to terabyte blocks despite it being on the roadmap. We just need to keep the blocksize ahead of demand.

> Why isn't Mr Ilirgashi listed here: https://litecoin-foundation.org/about-us/ ? Since you know so much, what is his role exactly?

He is listed there under ""John Eidson"" as ""Marketing and Communications"". Ilir Gashi is an alias or perphaps the other way around.

Making a new comment to make sure you see it.

Also on that note, why is it that Litecoin has existed for 9+ years and has a waaaaay smaller community than /r/btc? /r/litecoin is a ghosttown and there's no way Ver is running this many sockpuppets accounts lol.
