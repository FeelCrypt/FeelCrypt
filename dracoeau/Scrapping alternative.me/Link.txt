Détails de leur méthode calcul : 
Volatility (25 %)
We’re measuring the current volatility and max. drawdowns of bitcoin and compare it with the 
corresponding average values of the last 30 days and 90 days.

Market Momentum/Volume (25%)
Also, we’re measuring the current volume and market momentum (again in comparison with the last 30/90 day 
average values) and put those two values together.

Social Media (15%)
While our reddit sentiment analysis is still not in the live index 
(we’re still experimenting some market-related key words in the text processing algorithm), our twitter analysis 
is running. There, we gather and count posts on various hashtags for each coin (publicly, we show only those 
for Bitcoin) and check how fast and how many interactions they receive in certain time frames).

Surveys (15%)
Together with strawpoll.com (disclaimer: we own this site, too), quite a large public polling platform, we’re 
conducting weekly crypto polls and ask people how they see the market. Usually, we’re seeing 2,000 - 3,000 votes 
on each poll, so we do get a picture of the sentiment of a group of crypto investors.

Dominance (10%)
The dominance of a coin resembles the market cap share of the whole crypto market. Especially for Bitcoin, we 
think that a rise in Bitcoin dominance is caused by a fear of (and thus a reduction of) too speculative alt-coin 
investments, since Bitcoin is becoming more and more the safe haven of crypto. On the other side, when Bitcoin 
dominance shrinks, people are getting more greedy by investing in more risky alt-coins, dreaming of their chance 
in next big bull run.

Trends (10%)
We pull Google Trends data for various Bitcoin related search queries and crunch those numbers, especially the 
change of search volumes as well as recommended other currently popular searches. For example, if you check 
Google Trends for "Bitcoin", you can’t get much information from the search volume.
