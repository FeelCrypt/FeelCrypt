"Traditional banks are in the business of providing debt to people and businesses in exchange for future repayment of the debt plus interest. They do not care if you use USD, Euros, Yen, or BTC. 

One way they provide debt to consumers is through credit cards where they charge merchants a fee to process the transaction, while making the said transaction safe, simple and with a reward in the form of points to the consumer. 

Crypto has a long way to go before they can threaten credit cards. Crypto will never threaten banks, as currency (crypto or fiat) is inherently different than a institution that provides debt."
"This makes no sense. Uber is direct competition to Taxi company’s. 

Bitcoin is not an institution and is a currency/technology/etc...that is able to be used by banks if they were so inclined.

It would more like if Yellow Cab had to reorganize as Blue Cab - would they lose any identity? Would it even work for them? Do people want to ride in blue cars more? "
"Banking could be adapted to work with crypto, but literally all financial instruments are already digital so why would they bother? 

&#x200B;

And the belief that Bitcoin prices can stabilize is nonsense. There isn't enough liquidity in the world for any financial asset to have stable value relative to everything else. The USD is the most liquid financial instrument in the world and it still needs interest rates and capital controls to maintain relative stability. Anything crypto inherently can't have that."
"They should be worried about missing out on the technology and funds being moved into crypto and out of the banking system. 

I have no idea which one will win or when that will be...could be 100 years from now but crypto is here to stay. If it weren’t people wouldn’t still be arguing  like they have for at least few years now (time I’ve known/paid attention to crypto; i do not have and holdings on it either) if it is here or not. 

I imagine we will see a dramatic transition in how fiat money is handled in the future...to me it doesn’t make sense to continue to be maintained how it primarily is now...this might be the one event that could get rid of crypto entirely. Makes no difference to me but the technology has too many possibilities to dismiss."
