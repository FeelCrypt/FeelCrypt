"Bitcoin BCH is Bitcoin. 

No offence intended, but I'm not sure if you understand what a brand is? 

Bcash is an attempt to confuse the Bitcoin Cash Brand, alienate it from hits origins. Bcash requires you build a new brand.

Likewise green is an attempt to differentiate Bitcoin Cash from Bitcoin Core, it requires you build a new brand image.

Bcash = green

Bitcoin Cash = Orange. 

failing to understand this is probably why people haven't ever paid you to design brand identities. 

It so happens that many Bitcoin Cash enthusiasts were able to recognise the Brand dilution with Bcash, but not able to recognise the same with Green. Brands are not dictated they are earned, Brand images are used to leverage the brand. 

I'm pro brand confusion, it gives Bitcoin Cash enthusiasts an opportunity to muy more BCH at a discount. 

But to grow Bitcoin BCH needs a consistent brand identity and given 80% of Bitcoin were issued before the BCH fork I'd say it's >80% Bitcoin.

"Bitcoin Cash, or BCH, or Bcash.  But NOT Bitcoin (BCH)!  The parentheses make it look like you are stating the Abbrivation to the foremintioned ""Bitcoin""."
no, its still called bcash.
bitcoin is BTC which BCH is a fork of, stop trying to scam people. 
Yes? 
isbot <SwedishSalsa>
He's right. Theymos should fork off and create Theymoscoin and /r/Theymos
Can you do that to me too. 
I don't understand your comment. People who like bitcoin cash are almost all people who used bitocin for years, understand how it works, and don't want it to be broken and corrupt, how is that a bad thing?
I'm pretty invested into EOS myself, having started off with ETH. You can see how much things are spicing up as a whole. 
There is no reason why BCH couldn't function on Ethereum Plasma chain (It's still undeveloped tech, but should be redy within reasonable time frame) - this is more or less ethereum version of side chain, everyone should be happy
"Then open the mod logs. You can keep repeating this but we all know what we were banned and censored for, and it wasn't what you say.

So open the mod logs. Let us see the justice you are doling out left and right.

You are arguing for less transparency, it makes no sense."
"moderation is a lie, it's censorship pure and simple.

moderation would require obeying the rules. "
"It's public knowledge that it's a case study for how to breed a regime based on the foundations of censorship and closure.

If anyone wonders how guys like Hitler or Stalin were able to gain control of peoples mind - study r bitcoin - it's a neat model.

Anyone knew what they are doing, it was public knowledge.

But it took several decades, even until today  to work up all the crimes that have been conducted off the records - only mentioned in secret logs which have been made available afterwards."
"Personally I wasn't aware of those deleted topics, but I think the fact that there is an open modlog on this sub is a huge factor in why people feel the censorship is seen as more acceptable.

Have you asked the mods directly about any of those posts you pointed out being deleted? Maybe they came from known spammer usernames or something along those lines? I've always felt the mods here were pretty upfront about things and they're not trying to hide those deletions as evidenced by the fact that you're referencing them, so maybe there is a legitimate reason?

It's funny, the /r/bitcoin mods use the same excuse, spam, for why they remove a lot of posts. The difference is that they hide the modlog so I have no way of looking into it and verifying what they say is true."
Who decides on what is an altcoin and what isn't?
But that’s the point.  You do get banned on r/bitcoin for saying you want bigger blocks.  That’s why we ended up with BCH in my opinion, because if the majority had been allowed to express their opinion, it would have become clear that the “contentious hard fork”was contentious for a very small minority - unfortunately headed by Theymos and u/nullc 
">There’s a difference between a controversial opinion and actively promoting altcoins and other projects.

Altcoins themselves are allowed to be discussed, but *only* negative posts.  Any positive post is ""promoting altcoins"" and is removed.  All negative posts are left up.

So casual readers see nothing but negative news against the projects the mods dislike, but never see the positive news to balance it.  It's just propaganda.  "
"Problem is, that LTC was, promoted there actively and mods didn't do a shit. Hypocrisy in the name of promoting SegWit that was implemented in LTC first. 
Also, I remember them removing links to Bitcoin Cash (or just Unlimited client?
Dont remember exactly)  patched clients when DoS vulnerability was discovered. Links to instructions how to perform attacks were left intact... "
"> There’s a difference between a controversial opinion and actively promoting altcoins and other projects.

Except these goalposts have moved many times, so we all see right through the ruse."
fuck off. I got banned from your shit r/bitcoin even before there was bitcoin cash. You absolutly were not allowed to advocate for bigger blocks
When the purge started, there was no bch and conversations about expanding the blocksize were removed. Did they adjust the moderation policy?
"It's OK on r bitcoin to conduct hate speech - actually it's welcome.

They play a very twisted game and any word coming from them should not be considered as honest - until the moderation logs are open.

As long moderation logs are closed it is just to easy to sugarcoat the situation.
Their words are without weight and value until this is getting disclosed.

It's pathetic from their side and in meanwhile these statists show up here to fool around."

"It's so interesting to me how the users here pretend that [the censorship that occurs every day on this subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7dlyk4/censorship/duaqgxb/) doesn't exist.

Every time I point it out, the people here try to change the subject and talk about *other* subreddits, rather than acknowledging that rule-abiding posts are constantly being removed from this subreddit by its moderators with no accompanying explanation. It is surreal to see this happen here, *without fail*, every time I bring the subject up and provide proof of what I'm saying."
"And it's a good thing that you'd be censored because this is reddit and it's not a place for meaningful discussion.  

However, this community, and /r/Bitcoin do in some way provide a medium for understanding Bitcoin.  

This subreddit is full of logical fallacies, false facts, and frankly bull shit.  

It's politics... not educational or rational.  It's bull shit.  People like Roger Ver are the reason Bitcoin was invented.  He lives to control systems and people and profit off of them.  That's exactly what he is doing here.  

It's impossible for the few number of people who actually have a clue as to how Bitcoin works on multiple levels in terms of economics, code, and game theory to retort the baseless attacks that run rampant on this subreddit.  It's time consuming and it is far more difficult to rationally undo fud with an individual than it is to induce it. 

You see executing psy-op attack on Bitcoin can be relatively cheap and profitable.  This is what Roger Ver is doing.  

So anyway when I came to this subreddit last year .. I was shocked by the moderation on /r/bitcoin... Then I took the advice and did my own research.  I was mislead for a while.  Then I found the opposing side's position and on a technical level they made a very strong case.  

I have yet to see a convincing retort to their position.  

So this subreddit caused me undo stress and mislead me for a while and for that I fucking hate every bcash shill there is.  

On the other hand I do appreciate Roger Ver pen testing the Bitcoin community.  If at the end of it all it comes out he was just doing this playing the villian... then Good he would really be Bitcoin Jesus sacrificing himself (his reputation even further) for the long term good of the bitcoin community.  "
There’s a difference between a controversial opinion and actively promoting altcoins and other projects. It’s fine to say “I think we need bigger blocks”, but it’s obviously not OK to go on /r/Bitcoin and say things like “Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin” in an effort to confuse or mislead, or point users to software that departs from the Bitcoin consensus.
Shocking that the guy using “cuck” doesn’t know the difference between “theirs” and “there’s”...
he had a point before the message got edited
"if you had 1 bitcoin and 1 bch 6 months ago and sold the BCH for more bitcoin.  You'd have $13600.32 or 1.34 BTC 

If you had 1 bitcoin and 1 bch 6 months ago and saved it.  Then today sold your bch for btc.. you'd have 1.135 BTC or 11519.68

EEEKK... that's a a 15% drop... damn "
He is worshipped on r/bitcoin. He is a very smart cookie, but obvious troll.
yeah he plays that game with calling transactions he doesnt like spam too.. He can code. But his opinions suck
Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't a LN node similar to setting up a node on the Bitcoin mainnet? No permission is needed, therefore you don't have to go through any centralized service.
You do not need to make an account to use lightening network. You create a payment channel. Very different things. 
Yes his tonal bitcoin client has been a valuable addition to the world of Bitcoin. /s
Ya, he thinks the earth is the center. To be clear.
"**Barycenter**

The barycenter (or barycentre; from the Ancient Greek βαρύς heavy + κέντρον centre) is the center of mass of two or more bodies that are orbiting each other, which is the point around which they both orbit. It is an important concept in fields such as astronomy and astrophysics. The distance from a body's center of mass to the barycenter can be calculated as a simple two-body problem.

In cases where one of the two objects is considerably more massive than the other (and relatively close), the barycenter will typically be located within the more massive object.

Sharding must save ETH, or other SC platforms will come and eat its marketshare soon...SC's are hot... EOS, NEO, TEZOS, Shift, Expanse, Cardano etc etc... Smart contracts are coming for ETH
You can't value assets like that. This is to say my USD has gone down 20% because I didn't use it to buy litecoin yesterday.
True to an extent, you have to have the funds available for people to route through your node, so larger companies with more liquidity will naturally become large hubs most transactions will pass through.
people are trying to hide the truth here by downvotes (essentially, censorship?)... cognitive dissonance is amazing.
Wrong, wrong, wrong. 
Not even close to true, seems you don't understand how the blockchain works.
You poor thing.
Haha really? Mental hoops? how tiny is your world?
"First, note that you're taking the ""double-down on the changing the subject to focus on a different subreddit"" strategy, once again reaffirming my initial point here. This doesn't bode well in the ""does this account reflect a genuine person trying to seek truth and engage in civil discourse, or a troll solely interested in spreading malicious, false propaganda"" department... but whatever, let's set that aside for the moment.

>How about you extend an olive branch and unban me from /r/bitcoin then?


Have you appealed (or even inquired about) your ban via the mod-mail feature? Generally that's the proper medium to do so (and the first step to take, if you're interested in getting un-banned).

>You'll never win over someone like me

I'm not sure what you're referring to in terms of ""winning""... are we competing in some way that I wasn't aware of? I'm simply trying to discover, express, and propagate the truth, thereby furthering the collective understanding to the best of my ability; incidentally, that's all I am ever really doing on reddit. I would hope that this (or something like it) would be a common goal we share.

>someone like me who was banned for nothing except challenging theymos

You claim that you were ""banned for nothing except challenging theymos"", but this doesn't appear to be the case. This leads me to believe that you haven't actually inquired into the reason for your ban, which once again doesn't bode well for your sincerity or intentions here.

>no matter how strong you think your argument is because I'm living it personally

I also don't understand this bit, because none of the statements I've put forth so far have to do with anything that you're ""living personally"" in any way that I can see. *Again*, I'll set this aside, though.

>That's why your time here is probably better spent elsewhere.

I agree. I'll go even farther: my time is probably better spent elsewhere, period. The very presence of signal in this chamber of noise is questionable.

>You're telling me you're nice while slapping me in the face at the same time.

I am neither telling you that I am nice nor am I slapping you in the face. I'm furnishing facts and correcting misconceptions with the relevant truths. Until this most recent comment, nothing that I had said was in specific reference to you at all, other than to observe that you had proved my primary point with your very first reply to me.

In any case, if you offer me your honest assurance that you're not going to go deliberately breaking the rules of the /r/Bitcoin subreddit (and to be perfectly clear here, going around trying to convince people that ""BCH is the real Bitcoin"" *does* unambiguously qualify as breaking the subreddit rules), I will rescind your ban in good faith."
"This is what I said - 

>""I support a future hardfork which increases the block weight limit in due time.""

I am advocating a future hardfork to increase the blocksize. "
By all means, expand my world and tell me about these blockstream accounts.
"> going around trying to convince people that ""BCH is the real Bitcoin""

I've never done this, so it won't be an issue. 

> I will rescind your ban in good faith.

I honestly appreciate that and it makes me happy to know someone over there is willing to listen sometimes. It was not my experience in the past when trying to talk to other mods. I really don't think I broke any rules over there other than to make some chiding posts, so I will take your olive branch and will vow to only post high effort content on your sub."
"Look at the semantic leaps he had to make in order to get his point to sound palatable over there. Also you posted it as a reply to a random topic, go make your own post directly supporting a blocksize increase today.

You're not playing fair my friend. At least stop lying to yourself, we're not falling for it so there's no point."
"All North Corean agitators say ""I support a future block size increase"". Even the **C**hief **T**error **O**fficer babbled such shit into the cyperspace, and all the minions parrot the shit of their idol. "
The ban's lifted. Thanks in advance.
bitusher is a sad troll
"Yep, what's even more sad is that he goes to beginner crypto subs to try and indoctrinate people with his political views as early as he can.

The last thing we should be doing is talking politics to someone who just wants to understand how crypto works."
If you want to understand how bitcoin works you damn sure better understand the politics....The reason you don’t want politics talked is because you’re on the bad actor side and talking about your politics hurts your investment and strengthens mine. 
">hurts your investment and strengthens mine. 

This is a perfect illustration of the problem at hand. You assume that know what I'm invested in just because I posted one opinion on reddit.

 Please, enlighten me about what you think I'm invested in.
"
You’re shilling Bcash on a Bcash sub, it’s not rocket surgery champ.
"You're just pretending to be ignorant, or you are ignorant.

I along with thousands of other bitcoiners have been banned from posting on r/bitcoin for no other reason than expressing coherent arguments in favour of removing the transaction limit.

Until I'm allowed to express my opinions, discuss evidence politely, and respectfully r/bitcoin is censoring my perspective."
oh the liar triing to show he isn't a liar by lying great example!
Yes you’re right.  Saying “I do support a block weight increase, at some point, when appropriate...” is perfectly acceptable.  Sigh...
"How about you extend an olive branch and unban me from /r/bitcoin then? 

You'll never win over someone like me who was banned for nothing except challenging theymos, no matter how strong you think your argument is because I'm living it personally.

That's why your time here is probably better spent elsewhere. You're telling me you're nice while slapping me in the face at the same time."
"I think it is, but you still need to pay fees when opening/closing a channel. Anyone can open a lightning node, which is very cool.

If BTC's fees were at BCH levels, LN's use would skyrocket. Otherwise, BTC would be called ""LightningCoin"" and everyone would keep their funds in channels indefinitely. Only big companies, banks and governments would afford high fees of using the more secure BTC blockchain, which is a deal breaker."
No, because realistically, that payment channel will also include an account with Blockstream that lets them forward your payments to someone else. And you'd pay them a little bit for every transaction.
"Well, most people will be using Lightning via services like Coinbase so yes for most people the onramps to Lightning will still be AML KYC affairs.

A channel is really just another word for account really. You commit funds to a contract with another entity. Everyone else in the world calls that an account."
We can all joke about Bitcoin Knots (as everyone does... because seriously... why does it exist) but in all seriousness, his contributions to the actual codebase of Bitcoin Core wallet software have been pretty substantial.
"Could you explain what you are doing in this sub right now?

Whining and bitching fit the description?"
"You can do it to yourself

Because some people incessantly said so some months ago.

I wouldn't call him very smart. Somethings he may be very knowledgeable about, but I can't attribute general knowledge to someone who believes in geocentrics.
"It's quite clear why the threads were removed (apparently using the word ""bcash"" alone is enough to warrant a removal in most cases). The moderators here have never been willing to engage in civil dialogue with me; every time I try to discuss anything with them, no matter how politely I do, they call me ""retard"", ""Hitler"", ""piece of shit"", ""scum"", and a long list of other nasty epithets, and pointedly refuse to actually discuss whatever subject I am bringing up... and as lovely of an experience as that is, I am not particularly interested in another round of it.

>It's funny, the /r/bitcoin mods use the same excuse, spam, for why they remove a lot of posts.

No, we don't (unless it actually *is* spam). The vast majority of posts that are removed from there are actually flaired so that the rBitcoinMod account can automatically remove the post and respond with a distinguished comment to notify the user of the reason for the removal and suggest a next step. You can see a list of its recent actions directly from [its user page](https://www.reddit.com/user/rbitcoinmod), in fact.

The mod-logs aren't ""hidden"" in any sense, they're just not published publicly, just like [you don't publish comprehensive financial records for you and your family, even if I ask you to](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7ej6io/roger_ver_is_paying_millions_in_social_media/dq7q8dn/). Of course, if you want to turn over those records and prove you're not a human trafficker, please let me know, and we can proceed from there.

In any case, it's clear that public mod-logs don't really matter; after all, no one ever cares about what they contain for *this* subreddit (indicating the intent behind the demand rather blatantly).

Finally, before moving on, I'd just like to point out how directly you just proved my primary point above with your comment here:

>**Every time I point it out, the people here try to change the subject and talk about *other* subreddits**, rather than acknowledging that rule-abiding posts are constantly being removed from this subreddit by its moderators with no accompanying explanation. It is surreal to see this happen here, **without fail, every time I bring the subject up** and provide proof of what I'm saying."
"This is simply untrue ..

I'm not smart enough to think of what that might look like, but I do know that peaceful cooperation and empowerment leads to stronger products and communities.

"This is the same guy that promoted ""code is law"" and ""immutable smart contracts"" for Ethereum, and then mutated his blockchain to censor valid transactions so he could bail out his friends. Literal financial censorship. And then he has the nerve to act like he's some libertarian on Twitter? What a joke.

/u/theymos has been [protecting the Bitcoin subreddit from abuse for a very long time](https://web.archive.org/web/20111028210631/reddit.com/r/bitcoin). It's more than reasonable to have a moderation policy that ensures the community isn't taken over with off-topic discussions. Bitcoin Cash is technically, socially, economically and literally **not** Bitcoin, so it doesn't belong on /r/Bitcoin. Same with XT, Unlimited and every other altcoin or altcoin-to-be that claims it is Bitcoin or will become Bitcoin.

Libertarianism doesn't mean that you have to be **forced** to tolerate dangerous ideas you disagree with on your own private spaces. If you don't like the moderation policy on /r/Bitcoin, you aren't forced to use it, you can go elsewhere. Same with if you don't like the content on bitcoin.org or bitcointalk.org."
"Wow this is pretty fucking stupid.  Greg slammed Vitalik over his power over a rather significant financial platform which he doesn't actually take seriously.  

Then Vitalik responds by saying Bitcoin isn't an open community platform because a subreddit .. LOL!!!! 

Yes Themos's moderation has no impact on Bitcoin and there are many other platforms where people can voice their opinions and he's comparing that to forking Ethereum when he lost money because he's stupid and incompetent.

"Damn I'm in the same boat. I really like bitcoin and LN but it sucks the community is so divided and we have to ""pick sides"". Wish we could all just get along but I guess that's against humane nature."
"I highly disagree with BCH's scaling solution, and am a fan of the LN.

That being said, while I have not personally been censored in /r/bitcoin, I certainly do believe all the outcry around me, and have dug into the problem and see the huge conflict of interest by the mods on /r/bitcoin.

I wonder if there is some way to have a /r/BTC of sorts, that's about BTC, not BCH (no offense meant). Wonder what we should call it. Maybe go by /r/lounge_of_theymos or something (similar to /r/trees and /r/marijuanaenthusiasts, and just talk about BTC without censorship of concerns, dissent of opinion in the direct BTC is headed, etc."
Yeah r/btc is good but endless shilling of BCH and attacks on BTC are exhausting.
"The arguments apologists put forward is mind boggling.

What do you call a person who can not tell the difference between ""good"" and ""allowed""? In my vocabulary, the word is ""totalitarian"". You may think this is a harsh label, but it certainly is the core fault that we have been struggling to get beyond. We have to overcome this stage and leave it behind, and everyone needs to be educated on what happened and why."

So why don't you open the modlogs to the public then?"
Then negative posts about bch or ver should be removed. Since as you say they have nothing to do with Bitcoin. But they aren't.
"Vitalik has long been an ally of r/btc's message. He has said that for Bitcoin to scale it needs to increase the size of its blocks; he called out Core for their failure to honour the HK agreement; has provided evidence of how Core's ironfisted ways have stifled innovation on BTC by, for instance, preventing ETH from being built on top of it; and he has called out Theymos for his antics. The latter point is especially significant when we consider how people like u/nullc, u/luke-jr, and the rest of the Core devs have failed to call out Theymos and the rBitcoin mods."
Yes, individual regulators can be nice people even though they may be getting a paycheck from the government which tries to enforce bad ideas. That's when you realize that their open nature with you is an opportunity to persuade them to resist bad policy.
as a moderator of r/ethtrader my doctrine has largely been *don't be like* r/bitcoin
"Helping or giving good advice to BTC (Bitcoin) dev team is actually bad for all Bitcoin Cash (BCH) ~~users~~ hodlers. It's like cutting a branch on which we sit.

Imagine if by some divine intervention, luke-jr, theymos, Blockstream, and all that's bad in Bitcoin (BTC) would go away. Bitcoin (BTC) would immediately shift block size to 8 or 32 MB, remove RBF, while keeping all the Segwit innovations. Fees would be the same or lower than BCH, thanks to Segwit. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) have no reason to exist, and it's value would drop to... I don't know, drop to where a redundant airdrop drops once it's dumping is complete.

I love what BCH is doing: it's enabling us to exchange money without any fear of high fees or network congestion. It's a real peer-to-peer cash system, what Bitcoin should be. My crypto holdings are at least 50% BCH by this point, because from what I've seen so far, I strongly believe it's going to win long-term. But if Bitcoin (BTC) implements all the good things from BCH, then the long-term projection is gone, and it's game over for us BCH holders.

So, just... Everyone, be careful who you help. Bitcoin (BTC) is fine the way it is. It's a blind god without a guide dog. Don't guide it, don't help it, unless it's about to kill itself and take with it the world it created. In that case just make sure it's death is slow and gentle."
This cannot be stated often enough. Users often criticize r/btc for being obsessed with attacking rBitcoin and BTC. It is however very important to regulary let the community know that there is another side they should check, which is getting censored on the main forums. There are a plethora of new users coming in who get told how bad r/btc is, even though there is really no comparison between the subs. How should they find out if we don't keep repeating it and upvoting it to our frontpage?
This is the most difficult part. I get nostalgic thinking back to the days when r/Bitcoin was free and open. It was so sad to see the slow and constant decline into what it has become. Such a shame.

I know this is off-topic, but that one really depends on how you define the center.  If you're talking center of mass, then it's a non-stationary point that doesn't line up with the center of the sun, and isn't even always within the sun's surface.

Well, to play devil's advocate, the sun may orbit the center of the solar system but the sun, itself, is not true center.  You need to consider that the sun is ever so slightly influenced by the gravity of everything else in the sol system, too.  Gravity doesn't only work in one direction.

That's because he is playing a semantic game. To him it is not censorship, it's preventing people from diluting the narrative or promoting non-consensus alts or some nonsense like that. I can't find the quote now but he explicitly doesn't think what the mods are doing is censorship. Whether he really believes that or just says it is another question.

"It would help if we keep reiterating the fundamental reasons why they are doing this.

There's an organization (blockstream), funded with tens of millions of dollars by VCs, trying to ensure that bitcoin sucks unless you use the Lightning Network.

The Lightning Network is a really neat technology whereby bitcoin transactions can be free as long as you make an account with a centralized service. But because it's complicated and hard to understand, they try to tell everyone the Lightning Network is decentralized.

When realistically, due to the network effect and how the Lightning Network works, it is likely that only one company can succeed at doing this.

**Blockstream wants to be that service and they believe if they succeed they will process transactions for the entire world.**

Vitalik <3
Luke-Jr is a censor himself with regard to trying to blacklist things from the blockchain he does not approve of. The guy seems fairly disliked both in rBTC and rBitcoin. I think he gets a power trip knowing how much a huge proportion of people in the Bitcoin community dislike him and how much power over the fate of Bitcoin he wields.
May offer the opportunity to convert to fiat later for a fee?
"I can speak to this.

I accept crypto, but my distributors do not. Some percentage of my sales will need to be converted to USD to cover expenses. The smart move would be to do that on a proper exchange, but if I'm already playing in coinbase's ecosystem maybe I let them handle it.

I was looking for this exact solution last weekend and thought I might have to build it myself. This is pretty great, if you ask me."
Right, but no documentation on what they are sending you (what is the payload), and no documentation on how to verify it is actually from them. We can investigate the http request to find out what they are sending if we have to, but they need to have SOME documentation.
For someone like us, any many others, who use e-commerce sites like Shopify, the only crypto option we had via Coinbase was BTC.  This opens up BCH, ETH and LTC.  Until today we haven't accepted BCH or ETH via our website because it was just to much of a hassle to try and get it integrated.  With Coinbase Commerce it took me literally 12 minutes from the time I read about Coinbase Commerce to testing the payment gateway and then posting about it :)

so they do that for free to promote cryptocurrencies?
For BCH they did?
very true, bch volume has also dropped a crazy amount tho
THIS IS GOOD FOR BITCOIN 
I'm not sure what exactly the webhook is, but there is a section in the coinbase commerce settings to add webhook subscriptions. It says to add a URL to start receiving payment notifications 
"What sales guy - yada yada yada. I own it already. Whoopy. Any coin can be attacked that way and it's not easy, I'm sure it took a good bit of money and effort.
"
Your username has the answer 
If Bitcoin can be so effortlessly attacked then you should sell your BTC for a coin like BCH that welcomes all transactions. It should be left to a free market of miners who should decide what value a transaction has to them. And it seems transactions don’t have to be expensive to be included in every block with BCH. These fundamentals alone will win in the long run.. BCH can and will handle more traffic and that gives it a huge advantage over BTC. You can only do so much on BTC with 1mb.. it has already reached its peak. 
Why are you here if you think crypto may be doomed, lol.
"Yea, well deny it all you'd like but there was some shifty shit going on two weekends towards the close of last year during which time there was also quite a lot of pumping for BCH.

Now, you can say it's BS all you'd like. But from what I saw; there was definitely a manuver going on where the BTC mem-pool was purposely being spammed on top of the normal heavy traffic it was receiving.

You can call it fallacy but it was an attack. You can also deny any Russian meddling in the last election and just chalk me up as parinoid."

Lol, I hate to say it, but you are delusional.
Conspiracies..
What is this nonsense about spam. The brainwashing is strong with this one.. any transaction that pays a fee however large or small is called a transaction. It does not matter what the transaction is used for it is still a transaction. This spam regurgitation needs to stop.
Or maybe it’s just because btc had a lot of vendors/ATMS stop using it to stop the cluster EFF that was going on.  I’m sure if they all started accepting it again we would see the same high fees kick in.  
When demand goes back up which one will have low fees?
Yep, across pretty much all cryptos.
When is LolNet?
"> (did I win?)

No."
They burned up that 75 million. Maybe they need some more (bitcoin) cash?
Or maybe it's because the network is not being spammed to prop BCH up artificially currently. It's kinda d of expensive to do it all the time so they save it for special times, like when Bitmain wants to move a lot of hardware for overpriced BCH.
Doesn’t matter. That’s not what OP said. He said crypto. 
No, it's right in the payment settings on your shopify site. Just choose coinbase commerce from the drop down menu in the alternate payments section. You will need the email you signed up with in coinbase commercial and an API key. 
Www.badrx.net
What’s the website?
Maybe they don't care about small value transactions. I recall BitPay's CEO talking about how they did a lot of high value transactions.
I still sometimes use bitpay to pay with BTC. It makes no sense they're talking so long with BCH, I'd much rather use BCH for payments and hodl the BTC due to the slowness of it. (I always rebuy BCH after using it for commerce though). 
"Does anyone here regret not being around when you could mine Bitcoin using a CPU?

PSA: Bitcoin was ported onto an ethereum smart contract. You can mine it now. Mining difficulty is only at 2 so far.

It is explained at r/tokenmining and 0xbitcoin.org

"
Who is Bitpay??? Are they related to Ledger??? Never heard of these horrible companies...
"It took all of 12 minutes for me to set Coinbase Commerce up with my Shopify store and now we can accept BCH, BTC, ETH and LTC.  Until today we could only accept BTC and LTC because they were the only cryptos with gateways that worked easily with Shopify.  This is a big day for BCH.

Bitpay really screwed themselves because I had their gateway set up and waiting for them to implement BCH and it never happened.  Now that I can take four cryptos with one gateway... it would take a lot more work to get us to switch now.

Oh, so you can now buy yaupon with BCH now ;)  Yaupon is N. America's only native caffeinated plant.  We wild harvest it in central Texas and make really tasty tea with it.  https://lostpinesyaupontea.com"
"I have shopify. I wish it had BCH support. 
Maybe it's not active yet.
Proof: https://imgur.com/tHBOxTB

Correct me if I am wrong but BitPay allows merchants to get funds in fiat and this is a service you integrate with your portal to accept crypto into your own wallet.
I like how they made sure there's exactly 2.5687 of both BTC and BCH in that example dashboard screenshot so that nobody's feelings would be hurt.

No, first just create your account on coinbase commerce. Generate the api key from the settings. In shopify settings go to payment options, alternate payments, choose coinbase commerce. Then just enter the email you registered with coinbase commerce and enter the api key. 
woocommerce?
How did you integrate this into Shopify? Is this something that I'd need to hire a dev for? 
I have a shopify hosted site, so all I had to do was choose coinbase commerce as an alternative payment option. It just asks for you email from your cc account and api key and that's it. 
"Did you find any documentation? What do their webhooks send? How do you verify webhook data? Can we do testing using testnet coins?

I found no documentation so far, hoping they will add soon. 

Yes it is super easy to add a button to the site, but I need to have things happen when payment is received. How are you handling this?"
I think the news said the new service can be implemented by any vendor. I'd guess it is an add-on and you need to add it before it can be accessed by customers.
Or send it to Coinbase. 
"> Coinbase's new platform is very welcome, but doesn't do that. At least not yet.

Coinbase already offered merchant services that instantly converted customer payments to fiat.  The new platform is for merchants who want to hold and control their own crypto, so I don't see them changing Coinbase Commerce in that way unless they retire their old merchant service."
"My guess is it has something to do with the same influential groups (big central banks in particular) who've been pulling the strings over at Blockstream (to keep BTC crippled/useless as a currency) - I'd bet they are also exercising influence over Bitpay. 
They're doing what they can to slow/stifle the adoption of cryptocurrencies. "
"What the point of using Bitcoin as an ETH smart contract.?

btc fees have been shockingly low lately.
Yeah, some people limit themselves unnecessarily. If it's cryptos, you simply MUST ALSO have BCH, ETH, LTC.

Yeah was looking for the same. Let me know if you find anything. Need to know what to expect in webhooks and also how to verify that info.
Yeah those check boxes are confusing and actually don't do anything. The coin selection is in the settings screen in Coinbase Commerce. BCH is fully supported. 
Zero. They can't charge fees since they aren't a middle man in this case.
I think the news said the new service can be implemented by any vendor. I'd guess it is an add-on and you need to add it before it can be accessed by customers.
