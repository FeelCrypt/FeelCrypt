Or you could run your own one ... so no, not forced at all fudster.
"Eragmus will either write an unreadable self-indulgent word salad, or if he's really testy reprise his ""who the fucking fuck fuck fuck fuck do you fucking think you fucking are?"" seizure episode originally targeted at Gavin but repeatedly edited with no apparent moderation consequences. Brgtroll the social media consultant flak will sound constipated, as usual."
"Sigh.. yeah, there's always the possibility of a >50% attack, but that's overrated. 

First, miners would have to stop mining on their chain just to perform this attack. That alone is big deterrent.  
Second, they'd have to organize and coordinate such attack. They don't seem that efficient in this matter.

And the ultimate deterrent : have a second code base ready that would change the mining algorithm in case that happens. That would solve the problem, and render all current mining equipment obsolete. If the economic majority stay in the new chain (very likely), then all miners investments would be lost. They wouldn't dare to provoke this outcome. Better wait and see who wins and point their equipment at the winner chain."
God normally filters this kind of spam.
Fuck you
Yeah, really wild. everybody knows Coinbase is an Orwellian nightmare to deal with, unless you've been under a rock for the last 3 years.
"first, assuming a bit more than 75% switch (lets say 80%), only 26% of the new network (~21% of total hashrate) needs to be active in the 51% attack. We already know some pools and singular entities control that much hashrate. Its still brand-suicide, but the more that people switch to 2mb, the weaker the old fork gets to these attacks. Its both a benefit and a risk to a financial network based on a complex network of hashing devices as it typically results in ""there can only be one""

secondly, changing the algorithm would not hurt the new >1mb chain - only the smaller chain. changing algorithm would certainly send any remaining SHA256 to the new >1mb blockchain. The btc/core chain would then be operated entirely by a new algorithm, that could be extremely vulnerable to anyone who is able to quickly assemble the first asic or a dedicated GPU farm (>1000 GPUs). This is typically new currencies gain in value as hashrate grows. To initiate a new hashrate when BTC is already worth >$100 (on the ~20% chain) could expose it to a huge list of issues.

I think that this whole issue is getting out of hand though with FUD on both sides. everyone wants scaling (though some arguably have motives to scale/stagnate for other less noble reasons), and i think that whatever can be done safely and in a short (well-tested) timeframe will prevail and gain consensus quickly.

I like 2mb, and i also like the majority of core roadmap (about 60-40 on rbf since it could better protect non-rbf transactions down the road). 2mb is a working tested patch while segwit requires a lot more modification to how blocks work and validate, and as such i think 2mb in Q1-Q2 2016 and segwit in Q3 could be best overall. This issue should not be so devisive as it is if only both dev teams would work together to ensure quality code and testnet usage for everyone "
Fairytales. Dream on.
