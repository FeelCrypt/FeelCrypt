Correct me if my memory is failing me but didn’t he hire who he thought was a hitman to kill someone?
Good point, did he paid for it?
Paying for it is a crime and shows intent.

That you should not spend it?

I dunno... I just watched the actual presentation.. I definitely started out thinking it was a joke, but I'm pretty sure it's not."
ETH price has recovered somewhat, and it is still no. 2. Sure, a lot of ICOs are scams, but ETH is not by any measure.
So if something drops in price it's a scam *cough btc*? The word scam has been raped to the point where it's completely meaningless.
"""If you do not agree with these 4 truths, then you are wrong. Of course you are free to be wrong."" That is either top level trolling, or this guy seriously believes the slide he created.

Insane
how is it trolling? of course someone will ask for context. Are you new to reddit or what?
"You were going well up until

He has a good point you know, people want to know the context. Because if that slide is serious, that would be nuts"
"I assumed you were replying to me. I guess you weren't?

I never said anything about the context. It was an [image I saw on Twitter](https://twitter.com/elatyshev/status/1043756813387223040). I thought it succinctly framed what I personally think is wrong with the community. I shared it here.

"the points are silly, especially the one about spending BTC =being lured in a scam

the slide was made by an obviously toxic BTC cultist, the fact that he is worshiped by a wanna-be-CEO of a no-name exchange tells a lot about who finds such points valuable information imo"

Most people here want A Peer to Peer Electronic Cash System on an uncensorable ledger.  That's why they like BCH.
"I read most of the comments on the thread and only a few attribute it to core.

Blockstream's ex-CTO and founder is Greg Maxwell who has had a lot of influence over BTC. Blockstream's funding includes AXA. I am not convinced blockstream is a bilderberg controlled entity, but can you see how people would think that?"
No, dude is definitely dead serious
you obviously don't know who zucco is. he's not just a random CEO of an obscure firm.  I wouldn't go around showing off your ignorance like that
Perfect example of ad-hominem. How does that make OP's point less valid?
"I don't understand how that's relevant.

I posted the picture because I thought that the image was interesting, regardless of who took it. Maybe it's a joke. Maybe it isnt.

The content on the slide is still interesting, regardless of the how and why.

If I had have titled the post, ""Dragon's Den Evil Plot Exposed"", then yeah ok the context matters. But...

just no."

I can't find this video fragment anymore, looks like it's removed.

I think its well established at this point that BTC consists of sociopaths, narcisists and bullies that is less a community, and more a howling, foaming at the moth mob.

That's pretty lame
they don't want you to spend it? it's a digital collectible, so sad. I'm sticking with ETH, if they are able to pull off all their plans by 2021 it will overtake all other crypto. because it will actually have utility.

Lmao whats the context of this, this looks like satire.
This is borderline Nazi
