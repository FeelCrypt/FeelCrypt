Who said it was the most efficient? Obviously, mesh networks are more efficient for sending packets to my neighbor, but that doesn't mean its practical to develop a mesh network that will enable me to transmit large amounts of data to the guy the next town over, and definitely not to anyone across an ocean. Also, there is a great difference between decentralized routing being theoretically possible, and the actual owners of the infrastructure (and their governments) from actually allowing you to do it.;7;1;False;JeffKSkilling;ckwvo9j;Protestors are using using a P2P mesh network (Firechat) in Hong Kong to coordinate and not get shut down.

"I actually see it backwards: with bitcoin, mesh networks (and internet) can reach every point on the planet, banning (or unplugging) the internet would become even more ineffective (see what I did there?)

Why is this? Because Bitcoin allows machines to exchange value, thus you can have a system where nodes are compensated for the bandwidth the provide. This is working in HK because text messaging is low bandwidth and everybody contributes out of a sense of camaraderie and duty, but you need bitcoin to build solid, stable, long term meshnets.

"Your implicit surmise that the bus topology is the most efficient mode of transport is falsifiable by an easy example in the application layer:  The next time you sit down and use your favorite instant messaging client to talk to your next-door neighbor, ask why the TCP packet carrying your message had to go all the way to a server in Mountain View, CA (for Google Chat - of course other locations for other services).

Clearly the mesh topology is a more efficient physical layer for the needs of this particular application.

Now, to your point: Yes, of course the bus topology has it's place.  However, as many great minds of network topology have pointed out, a bus topology needn't imply centralized authority over things like, as you mention, DNS.

"> The current contract runs through 2014, and there is no reason to believe that it won’t be renewed beyond that. The only creative-side people who have the power to shut down the show are the six principal voice actors,36 and they have one of the sweetest gigs in show business. They only have to work a few hours a week and they aren’t even required to be in Los Angeles with the rest of the (non-animation) staff. They can record from anywhere. Unsurprisingly, they reportedly agreed to a serious pay cut to keep the series going in October of 2011.
> 
> And why shouldn’t they? The voice actors were paid peanuts for much of the early run of the show, and the six of them have done as much as anyone to make it the boundless money fountain it is today. They deserve to cash in. More importantly, the overwhelming majority of the animators, staff and hangers-on aren’t rich. It wouldn’t do them any good to end the show.
