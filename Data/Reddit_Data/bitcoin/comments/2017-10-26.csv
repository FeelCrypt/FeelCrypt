"I don't think you understand the benefits to blockchain technologies.  You realize that the centralized databases that banks already use are more energy efficient than a blockchain would be?  The main benefit of a blockchain is to create a trustless ledger that allows people who don't know each other to transact without any friction.  Banks are currently that friction; they are the middleman.  Any transaction goes through their personal ledgers and is confirmed by them before any funds are truly sent.  But blockchain technology will not allow banks to be more efficient.  The only way banks would be able to utilize blockchain for economic gain would be to premine their own crypto and somehow convince customers that their new JPChase Coin® should be valued.  People might fall for bank issued shit coins at the beginning, but eventually everyone will realize that premined centralized coins are crap, and no one will buy them anymore.

"> I'm sure bitcoin will have demand when no reasonable company will accept it as currency.

What defines a ""reasonable company""? ""Reasonable"" here is pretty obviously a [weasel word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weasel_word). Companies like Valve and Overstock accept bitcoin. Which of [these companies](https://99bitcoins.com/who-accepts-bitcoins-payment-companies-stores-take-bitcoins/) are ""unreasonable"" companies? All of them?

> Waiting 2-3 hours for confirmation is revolutionary.

You only wait for 2-3 hours if you don't pay a high enough fee, which you will if you use most wallets. The fact that you can choose to have a lower fee if you don't mind a longer confirmation time isn't a deficiency in Bitcoin.

> Fees are unacceptable.

Average transaction fee is not a good metric. Exchanges and other companies tend to batch multiple transactions into one, which is cheaper regardless of what current fee levels are. Large transactions have much higher fees than small ones, even though the cost per output is lower than small ones. Median transaction fee should be used instead since it is not subject to skewing from outliers.

> The current price is the hopes and dreams that it will be accepted by online retailers, banks, and retail stores.

Citation needed. Is this also the source of gold's current price? No? Well then I guess you can have a store of value without being a significant medium of exchange.

> Claiming and comparing bitcoin to gold, is proving that the bitcoin community does not want a transactional currency but a commodity. 

No, it's not. Bitcoin is different things at different stages of its development. Even if Bitcoin was only a store of value at this time (which is obviously inaccurate), there's no reason to believe it wouldn't become a medium exchange once lightning networks are rolled out.

> Time is ticking, bitcoin is slow in a rapidly expanding playing field.

This is the only semi-accurate claim you've made in your post. If lightning networks aren't rolled out on a reasonable time frame, then some other cryptocurrency will take Bitcoin's place. Given that Bitcoin's price is on the rise while alt-coins are faltering, it's safe to say that the market thinks Bitcoin will come out as the winner in the medium term.";1;2;False;merehap;doxkniu;Bitcoin is going to do to banks what email did the post office and Amazon did to retail.;78uxpf;https://www.forbes.com/sites/briankelly/2017/10/24/why-bitcoin-matters-more-than-blockchain/?utm_source=followingimmediate&utm_source=TWITTER&utm_medium=email&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=20171023&utm_campaign=sprinklrForbesInvestorTwitter&utm_content=1125431648#5ae2449437ac

I'm not saying that banks won't innovate something, they very well might, but block chain is irrelevant technology to banks as we know them.

Dead on. American banks, and foreign banks that primarily deal with US dollars, don't need a whole new crypto currency. There's no reason for them to get away from transacting in their customer's most popular and secure fiat currency. The banks just need to update the central ACH system to be faster, more robust, and still able to deal with the millions of transfers it sees daily. I imagine a similar transfer accounting system to Bitcoin block chain that's less decentralized than any of the public crypto currencies are, but it will use a similar replicate of chains verification system, and it won't require the banks themselves to change much of any of their current software or currencies handled.;1;0;False;secondsbest;dox8hgm;Bitcoin is going to do to banks what email did the post office and Amazon did to retail.;78uxpf;https://www.forbes.com/sites/briankelly/2017/10/24/why-bitcoin-matters-more-than-blockchain/?utm_source=followingimmediate&utm_source=TWITTER&utm_medium=email&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=20171023&utm_campaign=sprinklrForbesInvestorTwitter&utm_content=1125431648#5ae2449437ac

"First of to clarify:

bch (or bcc)  = bitcoin cash

Btc (or btx) = bitcoin 

Btg = bitcoin gold

(they made a mess of these abbreviations) 

So you needed to own bitcoin, before the fork (btc) only then you would get bitcoin gold. If you owned bitcoin cash, you won't get anything.  

Found a topic about claiming your bitcoin cash, this should work the same for bitcoin gold (if you owned bitcoin)

A blockchain can be used to simply validate the flow of information or physical goods that have receipts or a trail.

Real world example: Disney corporation uses blockchain technology at their parks to prevent theft, minimize operating loss on goods, and tracking the travel of resources from one place to another.

They eventually might offer reward for mining it for them as the blockchain gets larger but they don't have to and it would only be what they do if it's cheaper than the losses they'd have without it.

"Take it up with that poster; he's the one that brought up cc's. I was correcting a factual error, one that you insist on repeating.

You are wrong that cc's are cheaper.  CC's charge merchants significant fees, and those are passed on to the consumer in higher prices.   Look no further than the difference between cash and cc prices at gas stations in some markets, or why some business refuse to accept cc's because they are so expensive.

My company makes software priced in the multiple thousands per license.  CC transaction fees are notoriously difficult to parse, but a fixed fee of 35 cents plus 3% isn't unusual for most transactions.  Tell me again how me, as a merchant, paying $150.35  for a single sale of my $5000 software is less expensive?  Lol.  Plus there is the threat of chargebacks.

Credit cards aren't cheaper than bitcoin.   A vendor gets charged a fixed % by Visa and MasterCard.  If you buy a 10,000$ item with a credit card the vendor loses 100$ or so on the sale in fees.  With bitcoin the fees are anywhere from free to a few cents (best case, when mempool isn't back logged) up to 2 or 3 dollars worst case when there is a back log of transactions.   2$ in fees is a lot if you're buying a 6$ sandwich....but it's absolutely nothing compared to ACH wire transfer fees or credit card fees if you're moving thousands of dollars.;2;1;False;HitMePat;doxcu24;Bitcoin is going to do to banks what email did the post office and Amazon did to retail.;78uxpf;https://www.forbes.com/sites/briankelly/2017/10/24/why-bitcoin-matters-more-than-blockchain/?utm_source=followingimmediate&utm_source=TWITTER&utm_medium=email&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=20171023&utm_campaign=sprinklrForbesInvestorTwitter&utm_content=1125431648#5ae2449437ac

why would a customer choose to shop at a store where they had to pay a transaction fee and couldn't do a charge back over a store that had no transaction fee and allowed chargebacks?

Merchants also aren't going to use bitcoin when it can take hours for a small transaction to go through. No one is going to wait 3 hours to buy a coffee with bitcoin and no retailer is going to just let someone walk out with goods only to find out 3 hours later the payment bounced.

"**Weasel word**

A weasel word, or anonymous authority, is an informal term for words and phrases aimed at creating an impression that a specific or meaningful statement has been made, when instead only a vague or ambiguous claim has actually been communicated. This can enable the speaker to later deny the specific meaning if the statement is challenged. Where this is the intention, use of weasel words is a form of tergiversation.

Weasel words can be used in advertising and in political statements, where it can be advantageous to cause the audience to develop a misleading impression.

A large amount of inefficiency due to the way banks interact with each OTHER. It doesn't take your bank 3 days to transfer money, it takes the string of financial institutions 3 days to transfer money. Having a distributed ledger among the FIs eases these inefficiencies.

">  Some very intelligent companies will allow the option of BTC to get the BTC fan boy niche, but exchange at the lowest rate for the past week or so (or 10% below market value if that moment is the lowest point for the last week). Then they will instantly trade back to fiat for instant profit.

BTC is not good for emergencies, neither is any cryptocurrency. If you need fiat immediately good luck. You can’t just deposit it in your bank that’ll take a week, good luck finding a seller in your area that can buy it immediately and not worry about it being a scam, sure you can go to a BTC atm but then take a huge percentage hit if you can even find a fiat-to-btc machine in your area. As of right now BTC is only good for investment purposes and you can tell that if you check any subreddit when all they care about is how much fiat it’s worth.  ;0;1;False;80085_lol;dox4b49;Bitcoin is going to do to banks what email did the post office and Amazon did to retail.;78uxpf;https://www.forbes.com/sites/briankelly/2017/10/24/why-bitcoin-matters-more-than-blockchain/?utm_source=followingimmediate&utm_source=TWITTER&utm_medium=email&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=20171023&utm_campaign=sprinklrForbesInvestorTwitter&utm_content=1125431648#5ae2449437ac

I rarely use checks, but there are times when they can be convenient or helpful. For instance we collect monthly dues for a kids sports team. When everyone pays by check at the same time we know who the money is from and the cashed check serves a receipt and proof of payment for the family. This is easier than everyone paying cash and trying to keeps track of who paid and when. It also avoids the situation where the mom says the dad paid or the dad said the mom paid.

"**1Malaysia Development Berhad scandal**

The 1Malaysia Development Berhad Scandal is an ongoing political scandal occurring in Malaysia. In 2015, Malaysia's Prime Minister, Najib Tun Razak, was accused of channelling over RM 2.67 billion (nearly USD 700 million) from 1MDB, a government-run strategic development company, to his personal bank accounts. The event triggered widespread criticisms among Malaysians, with many calling for Najib's resignation – including former Malaysian Prime Minister Tun Dr. Mahathir Mohamad.

"Bitcoin has its issues. Number 1 it uses SHA-256 for proof of work so it is vulnerable to ASICS. There have been several instances in the past where a single mining pool was able to briefly obtain over 50% of total hashing power.  Using a proof of work method that requires brute force computations has its drawbacks like the enormous amount of power that is required to maintain the proof of work for bitcoin. 

Second Bitcoin is extremely volatile with the value fluctuating on a day to day basis.  This happened before the hard fork and when the Chinese cracked down on cryptocurrencies. As far as I know Bitcoin has no way to hedge against volatility although there are probably services out there that allow you to do so. 

Finally the decentralized nature of bitcoin means that it is very difficult to make sweeping decisions related to the currency.

That being said in spite of all that bitcoin has been exploding in value.  When I looked at the market cap a year or 2 ago it was only 10 billion with Ethereum having a 1 billion market cap. Now Bitcoin is close to 100 billion and Ethereum is close to 30 billion.  Money has a way of retroactively solving all other issues. 

So in short I wouldn't expect Bitcoin to replace banking.  They are two different services.

That’s usually govt regulation not the banks fault. The costs related to providing that service for the bank are reflected in that fee. Banks are businesses just like a retail store or a mom and pop shop. They have to make money somehow to stay in business, and since 2007, regulation has increased significantly this driving up costs for banking a and forcing the banks to go through certain channels to get things like this done. This increases costs and time it takes. I go way further into this if you want, I work on the commercial side not retail but we do have to take regulatory compliance assessments that explain some of this stuff. ;15;0;False;WhackIsBack;dox2f3j;Bitcoin is going to do to banks what email did the post office and Amazon did to retail.;78uxpf;https://www.forbes.com/sites/briankelly/2017/10/24/why-bitcoin-matters-more-than-blockchain/?utm_source=followingimmediate&utm_source=TWITTER&utm_medium=email&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=20171023&utm_campaign=sprinklrForbesInvestorTwitter&utm_content=1125431648#5ae2449437ac

"Thank you for getting it.

Bitcoin is more about creating a new money, than sticking it to banks. Money is about network effects (is the ultimate network good).

The only really important questions, in my mind, are empirical; wait and see: is bitcoin the MySpace or the Facebook of crypto (proto)monies? Will bitcoin accumulate the critical mass of network effects in time to become a unit of account money and quell volatility; become mainstream enough to weather the severe persecution that it will face from the state and incumbent industries who will lobby the state? Will 2nd layer solutions extend the speed and ease and utility of Bitcoin enough to make bitcoin's first-mover advantage hold over technically superior altcoins (in much the way that ipv4 has been just good enough, to be able to find work arounds to its limitations and ride on the immense network effect it has, or switching costs to ipv6)?

Banks can and will be currency-agnostic. States will not.

">Cryptocurrencies don't facilitate the transfer of money between savers and borrowers

You don't mean lenders and borrowers? because transfer of bitcoin is built right into it.

>the most single important mechanism of finance

If you're criticizing bitcoin for not have an inherent mechanism to facilitate Lending then fine: of course it doesn't do that.

It's role is to be a currency... not a Man and a Contract that you (a Person) signs, nor also a Debt Collector if you don't pay back.

Of all of those actors above, in the typical Lending scheme of our modern day, bitcoins role is the capital that gets lent.  

In order for the other actors to take part in this Pantomime of modern day lending, they need to be built.

We're talking computer technology here. Automation of all of these mechanisms is possible.

"okay but usually you're not making international payments with cheques these days, it isn't the 90s.

There are services out there that will do international payments hassle free and for quite a low charge considering.

I.e. Western Union, TransferWise, Xe, WorldRemit, Revolut.

Banks are already getting disrupted by these services. You know what Bitcoin can't do and Visa, MasterCard and Amex can. Process a fucking payment in a matter of seconds anywhere you are in the world. There's a reason you centralise massive payment networks.

Sadly that's the worst, I worked with a partner in Canada, whom would write me a Check every month for my 80% share and he takes his 20%(long story to explain why he has to do it). So every month I had to wait a whole month just for my money to get approved and get it deposit into my bank account :/ worst 2 years of my life. And once had a check for $13k get lost in the mail, so I threaten them with a law suit as the Canadian bank refused to cancel the check as it was bank check or whatever the reason (been 4 years) and my bank had to use their insurance.

"I want to believe this but ... are the banks going to just ROLL OVER and give up control?  I mean, seriously ... think about what the banks allow to happen in modern society today (for good or bad):

- You can reverse a transaction if a fraudulent transaction happens on your account.

- You can reverse a transaction for a refund.

- You can reverse or cancel a transaction if you do not get what you were supposed to get.

- Authorities can freeze your account if you are delinquent on other legal obligations

All of this cannot happen with BITCOIN, which is largely the UPSIDE of Bitcoin ... but with the REFUNDS and reversals not able to happen anymore, people could have some bad things go down just by not being responsible.  The ANSWER could be ... BANKS could become BITCOIN ESCROW SERVICES, and therefore remain relevant.

"People who assert that bitcoin will replace banks don't seem to have a good grasp on what banks actually do. Banks aren't in the check-cashing or payment processing 'business'- they may derive some fee-based income from those services, but it's hardly their bread and butter. Banks are in the business of money rental. They pay you to park your funds with them, first literally via dividends (with more available the more locked in those funds are), then via incentivizing services like check issuance, peer to peer payments, online banking, billpay, etc. Those services are only an inducement to deposit, and all of those things are EXPENSES to the bank. They willingly pay them to secure the capital which they then promptly lend out. That's how they earn the lion's share of their income, and the better they strike the right balance of securing it for relatively little while lending as much of it out as safely possible, the more successful they become. They want to reward you for depositing cash with them so they can lend it out, and yeah, so they can cross-sell you more means by which you'll borrow (or earn interchange fees). But either way, that cash is promptly going right back out again at an advantageous rate of return. 

Bitcoin isn't an existential threat to that model. It could cause a disruption to the service incentive piece of the puzzle that helps banks secure cash, but they have many means of earning those deposits. Peer to peer lending, on the other hand, is a shot across the bow...";97;7;False;VLANtagonist;dox6tk7;Bitcoin is going to do to banks what email did the post office and Amazon did to retail.;78uxpf;https://www.forbes.com/sites/briankelly/2017/10/24/why-bitcoin-matters-more-than-blockchain/?utm_source=followingimmediate&utm_source=TWITTER&utm_medium=email&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=20171023&utm_campaign=sprinklrForbesInvestorTwitter&utm_content=1125431648#5ae2449437ac

"I have been digging into this for about two months and I can’t figure out two things that prevents me from embracing this.

1. Do we really think that if this became mainstream that the Federal reserve would allow it? We stopped printing $1000 bills so it would be hard to move millions of dollars and this plat form allows you to move as much as you like seemingly anonymous without any form of tracking.  What would stop the US from declaring it illegal overnight and making Bitcoin nonexistent?

2. How much can we really trust the blockchain? It seems to soft fork at will. It’s all managed by miners who are now teaming up to get greater share of new bitcoin but what would happen if enough teams worked together to change the ledger?

"I have left reddit for [a reddit alternative](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditAlternatives/wiki/index) due to years of admin mismanagement and preferential treatment for certain subreddits and users holding certain political and ideological views.  

   The situation has gotten especially worse since the appointment of Ellen Pao as CEO, culminating in the seemingly unjustified firings of several valuable employees and bans on hundreds of vibrant communities on completely trumped-up charges.  

   The resignation of Ellen Pao and the appointment of Steve Huffman as CEO, despite initial hopes, has continued the same trend.  

   As an act of protest, I have chosen to redact all the comments I've ever made on reddit, overwriting them with this message.

"Also, Amazon has taken hold of ONLINE retail. The online retail sales account for about 12% of total retail sales in the US (2016).

While Amazon has around 45% of that there’s no denying that they bring in some disruptions and innovation to the market. 

Considering how large Amazon are, and the statistics, I think bitcoin is far from disrupting banks - unpopular opinion perhaps.

Like, we may send fewer mails than before email, but we still send shit through post (I know amazon does...). So in conclusion, things change and adopt.

Banks are affected, but not disrupted.

I needed the money immediately (so no time to find a Caixa atm: also I didn't know why I was being charged so much) and don't give a crap about such amounts but it's just insane.

So I have some beef with bitcoin... it requires SEGWIT to allow it to have a chance at being the globally used currency - the process takes up too much memory and so there is a relatively small amount of transactions that can take place at one time. This will be very limiting. Also bitcoin is ‘de-centralised’ but I’ve been reading that there are holders of very large portions of bitcoin that are in partial control of the currency that said that they wouldn’t allow SEGWIT to be implemented in the system. Thus totally shutting down the crypto’s chance at going global. The idea of bitcoin is brilliant, but I reckon another crypto-currency to come will go global. ;1;0;False;wu-tang-it;doxnkqe;Bitcoin is going to do to banks what email did the post office and Amazon did to retail.;78uxpf;https://www.forbes.com/sites/briankelly/2017/10/24/why-bitcoin-matters-more-than-blockchain/?utm_source=followingimmediate&utm_source=TWITTER&utm_medium=email&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=20171023&utm_campaign=sprinklrForbesInvestorTwitter&utm_content=1125431648#5ae2449437ac

There is little chance Bitcoin becomes the norm for small transactions in the future. HOWEVER - I do see the potential that it remains the base for which all the other currencies are built. It already is when you think about it! You cannot (easily) get any other cryptocurrency without first getting Bitcoin. Stretch that thinking out a few years and I see an ecosystem where Bitcoin is used and valued at a macro-level, while a few specialized currencies are used day-to-day for specific use cases. ;1;1;False;Sipbackrelax;dox9cm3;Bitcoin is going to do to banks what email did the post office and Amazon did to retail.;78uxpf;https://www.forbes.com/sites/briankelly/2017/10/24/why-bitcoin-matters-more-than-blockchain/?utm_source=followingimmediate&utm_source=TWITTER&utm_medium=email&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=20171023&utm_campaign=sprinklrForbesInvestorTwitter&utm_content=1125431648#5ae2449437ac

"In the Netherlands it's quite easy, even for a student. Takes about 15 minutes maximum. In fact, I'd maybe say it's even easier as a student than as a normal person.

Also, since all banks here have good mobile apps and do instant payments between other people at your bank and next day payments with anyone else, all with zero fees, that's hard to complain about.

For me, it has more to do with my distrust of consumer banks gambling with their customers money and super shit interest rates.

I actually got an email from my bank the other day, saying:

>Uw spaargeld verdient beter! Met de huidige rente ligt uw spaargeld bijna stil. Dat is zonde, want er zijn genoeg slimme alternatieven.

> With the current interest rates your savings barely grow! That's too bad because there's smarter alternatives.

"In the USA our money and economy are relatively stable, so there's not as many advantages here to using bitcoin as a currency.   Until someday if shit hits the fan and the USD goes into hyperinflation, at that point you may wish you had cared about bitcoin.   

For me it's mostly just exciting to know that no one controls my BTC but me.   The government can't sieze it, the banks can't block me from accessing it, and I can spend it on anything without permission from anyone.   I may be 99% sure my government and/or bank will never try to seize/block me from my account balances...but if they did, I'm powerless to stop them.  With bitcoin they couldnt do it even if they want to.   Look at Greece and Cyprus when the banks seized deposits to pay for government debt as two sad examples.  Could it happen in the US too?  Yes.  Hopefully it never does but bitcoin is a hedge against that eventuality.
