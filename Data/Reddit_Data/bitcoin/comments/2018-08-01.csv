While I respect your knowledge on the subject, it is simply impossible for any debtor to continue buying our debt when our the interest on our debt alone rises above the annual GDP. There is simply no debating that point, because at THAT point it will require massive printing or creating new virtual currency, which other nations will take notice, meaning inflation will ramp up significantly, as well as the rating on our debt which will no longer be AAA. All those factors combined to make the dollar less trustworthy will ultimately send it tumbling down once it's no longer the world's supercurrency. That day will come, mark my words. You think they're printing all this money and making a killing on the fee they charge for e very dollar for nothing?

That must be taken with a grain of salt. The more the dollar inflates, the less it's worth. Sure, same is true with any fiat currency. However, we only issue new debt because of the trust in the stability of the dollar. If nations see the dollar is being printed too hastily and see it's going on an unsustainable path of maintaining its purchasing power, all they need to do is switch to another denomination. If and when the dollar is no longer the world's supercurrency then it's over for us. That's why we invade every county that threatens our denomination and it's value;1;0;False;hwmpunk;e3fa2k1;So they agree that fiat currency has no value anymore.;933bnu;https://i.redd.it/ozij0ypxn2d11.jpg

"> that government spending and specifically inflation will cause people to work for a lower real wage

Can you explain this? What do you mean by a lower real wage?

> It would be false to assume that everyone believes the Keynesian model or derivatives of it is best for humanity

But would it be true that almost the entire world, excluding Cuba and North Korea, runs on the Keynesian Model. You can argue Austrian all you want but 

> (this as the cause of inflation stimulating the economy is made very clear in the General Theory of Employment Interest and Money)....

Havn't read it but **Controlled Inflation** stimulates the economy by encouraging people to spend rather than to save their money. Having a linear 2% Inflation (or atleast thats what they aim for) means that even if you were to save your money, overtime, you would be losing a portion of the worth of the dollars. This combats hoarding, like we see in Bitcoin today.

> But that doesn't mean it's best overall in the long term.

There certainly are problems with it but it is much, much healthier for the economy as opposed to using Austrian School of Economics.

> Eventually, people abuse the power to control money and major problems result that might be larger than all the minor good they produced with such tight control

This is why I support cryptocurrency and the blockchain. However, I think you are oversimplifying the issue. I think you are assuming that the Federal Reserve itself is malicious. They are what help to drive the economy. They help to make important decisions that help to regulate the economy. I do agree that we need to do something different which is where I see blockchain having an impact. But I would say its naive to want a global currency that is based on Austrian School of Economics. Well, we've already seen the run with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. They are deflationary. They do not make a good choice for currency and would directly impact the economy.

> Similarly, convincing people to work for a lower real wage might be causing long-term problems we don't expect.

Again, I do not understand how this would cause people to work for a lower real wage. If you look at the [data](http://www.surlytrader.com/historical-salaries/), it suggests otherwise. After we got rid of the Gold Standard, the real wage actually grew to higher than it ever had before. And the Gold Standard is already regarded by most economics as having been a failure. Why do you think every country (again, aside from North Korea and Cuba) has switched to Fiat Currency.

> And again sometimes we abuse this idea and the cost of a sovereign debt crisis might be worse than all the minor gains we got along the way.

I will say that you make a good point with this one. I do agree with you on that. But I also think going the way with the Austrian School of Economics is a step in the wrong direction. I stated this above but again, I think blockchain can directly help our economy while still following the Keynesian school of economics. What we need is more stability in the people who control the money. Poor choices (which to be fair, running an economy is extremely hard and small choices can have major impacts) can lead to economic collapses like you said. Something inherently transparent, like the blockchain, I feel, can be used to make this system much better.

> Most importantly, regardless of whether inflation and/or controlled money supply is 'good' or 'bad' (it's a tough call), Bitcoin has a very clear opinion; Bitcoin is deflationary. The money supply is limited in the long run. When anyone loses a coin or the world GDP grows, Bitcoin is going to deflate. That is a goal (section 6 of the bitcoin whitepaper talks to incentives that work 'completely inflation free')

Yes, you are right that Bitcoin was built on this idea and it was purposelessly made to deflate. I am arguing that if we want a cyrptocurrency to be used in modern day society, we can build off of the blockchain and help redesign it, following more closely with Keynesian Economics (and like you said, whether you agree or disagree it is good/bad.)

> That is part of the addictive adoption strategy (good money pushing out bad). That is deeply embedded in the code and expectation. Bitcoin is going to drag us all into a deflationary world by eliminating competing inflationary assets.

I honestly love Bitcoin and have supported it for a long time but I don't really think that Bitcoin is going to be what stands on top in the end. I have more respect for Bitcoin than any other coin because its idea is what started a revolution and is what introduced the Blockchain. I also do not agree with the way Bitcoin chose to go and the ""censorship"" problems (hope I don't get banned lol) that goes on in the Bitcoin community. When the Bitcoin Cash fork happened, I was really hoping Bitcoin Cash would become the norm. Instead, Bitcoin remained and stayed the same. I mean, Bitcoin's community is pretty much just investors too who will defend anything. Remember those times when they were defending $45 fees for transactions. Yup lol. Thats why I hopped off the whole Bitcoin ride. I currently find ethereum to be superior as well and I do not understand why people are still on Bitcoin.";1;0;False;;e3dpzcu;So they agree that fiat currency has no value anymore.;933bnu;https://i.redd.it/ozij0ypxn2d11.jpg
"[This](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johntharvey/2012/09/10/impossible-to-default/#7ec8ba821180) should explain why.

The US never needs to default thus, it will not fall.

> there is 0% chance that the US will be forced to default on the debt.

> We could choose to do so, just as a person trapped in a warehouse full of food could choose to starve, but we could never be forced to. This is not a theory or conjecture, it is cold, hard fact. The reason the US could never be forced to default is that every single bit of the debt is owed in the currency that we and only we can issue: dollars. Unlike Greece, we don’t have to try to earn foreign exchange via exports or beg for better terms. There is simply no level of debt we could not repay with a keystroke.

 > Don’t take my word for it. Here are just a few folks from across the political spectrum and in different walks of life saying the same thing:

> ""The United States can pay any debt it has because we can always print money to do that. So there is zero probability of default."" Alan Greenspan

> “In the case of United States, default is absolutely impossible. All U.S. government debt is denominated in U.S. dollar assets.” Peter Zeihan, Vice President of Analysis for STRATFOR

> “In the case of governments boasting monetary sovereignty and debt denominated in its own currency, like the United States (but also Japan and the UK), it is technically impossible to fall into debt default.” Erwan Mahe, European asset allocation and options strategies adviser

"It would be false to assume that everyone believes the Keynesian model or derivatives of it is best for humanity. I agree that humans can in theory control inflation/deflation to make a stronger overall economy. I also agree that in periods of high-unemployment that government spending and specifically inflation will cause people to work for a lower real wage; driving employment back up and getting total production above what it would have been (this as the cause of inflation stimulating the economy is made very clear in the General Theory of Employment Interest and Money)....

But that doesn't mean it's best overall in the long term. Eventually, people abuse the power to control money and major problems result that might be larger than all the minor good they produced with such tight control.
