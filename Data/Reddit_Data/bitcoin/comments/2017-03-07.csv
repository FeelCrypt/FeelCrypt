When corporations control the government and enable monopolistic control, then they're a major problem. We have state monopoly capitalism and the basic rights of US citizens are compromised for the sake of private control of some markets that ought to be, at least in my opinion, public: healthcare, education, libraries, police force, fire protection, and maybe food and shelter. Even the founder of modern libertarianism, Hayek, believed that the state ought to provide basic health, shelter, and food. Free markets, which in the classical sense implies a lack of monopolies/oligopolies, in areas that aren't crucial to basic existence work well. Our government just hasn't busted up monopolies in about a century and fails to protect the commons against polluters/human rights abusers/etc. I'm also a fan of having worker representatives on the boards of corporations, as is done in Germany.;1;0;False;deebeedubbs;den01m0;BREAKING: CIA turned every Microsoft Windows PC in the world into spyware.

The discrepancy between what the people want and what the people get from government is enormous.

"Joe Nacchio was a giant steaming pile of shit.

> On March 15, 2005, Nacchio and six other former Qwest executives were sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. They were accused of a $3 billion financial fraud between 1999 and 2002 and of benefiting from an inflated stock price.

>In its case, the government stated that Nacchio continued to tell Wall Street that Qwest would be able to achieve aggressive revenue targets long after he knew that they could not be achieved. This helped it buy up regional phone rival US West, the government alleges[6] For his part, Nacchio maintained that he believed Qwest would soon be receiving several large government contracts. On November 21, 2005, The Wall Street Journal reported that Nacchio ""believed Qwest was doing well because it was getting lucrative secret national-security-related work from the federal government."" Nacchio claimed that he was not in a rightful state of mind when he sold his shares because of problems with his son, and the imminent announcement of a number of government contracts.

>Nacchio was indicted on December 20, 2005 on insider trading charges in Denver, Colorado. He was forced to surrender his passport for fear that he would flee the country. The indictment against Nacchio charged him with 42 counts of insider trading. Each count carries a potential 10-year jail term and corresponds to a sale of Qwest shares, including a flurry in April–May 2001, when Nacchio sold almost $39 million in stock. At the time, Qwest was trading between $41.12 and $38.31.

>Nacchio was convicted on 19 of 42 counts of insider trading case on April 19, 2007.[11] He was released on a $2 million bond. On July 27, 2007, Nacchio was sentenced to six years in federal prison. Federal Judge Edward Nottingham also ordered Nacchio to pay a $19 million fine and forfeit $52 million he gained in illegal stock sales. On March 17, 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit overturned his conviction on the basis of defense expert witness testimony that was improperly excluded, and ordered a new trial before a different trial judge.[12] Herbert J. Stern led Nacchio’s defense team during the initial trial,[12] while Maureen Mahoney was lead defense attorney during the appeal.[13] On February 25, 2009, the full Tenth Circuit reversed the three-judge panel and reinstated the conviction and sentence.[14][15]

>Nacchio surrendered April 14, 2009 to a federal prison camp in Schuylkill, Pennsylvania to begin serving a six-year sentence for the insider trading conviction. The United States Supreme Court denied bail pending appeal the same day.[3][16] His federal register number is 33973-013.[17]

>On October 5, 2009, the US Supreme Court denied certiorari, letting the conviction stand.[18]

>Nacchio finished serving his sentence on September 20, 2013.[19]

As for open source software, I mostly agree.  I am much more inclined to trust open source software when it comes to security, as a rule, it's basically always the most secure solution for exactly the reasons you point out.  That said, open source is definitely a double edged sword.  It allows you to put many pairs of eyes on a problem and route out any potential flaws.  But at the same time, being able to see the code absolutely **does** make one aspect of exploiting software easier - transparency naturally gives an attacker more information, knowledge of the internal mechanisms give one more of an idea on where to focus their efforts in developing an attack.

No, comments like **yours** don't help.  Nobody has bothered posing the question you are here because it's a fool's errand.  Neither is invulnerable, a solid understanding of the limitations of each in a security model is necessary.  One is a company legally required to work with them to infiltrate whatever they want.  The other is a software chain running on a hardware platform that in a vast majority of cases is controlled by a company that is legally required to work with them to infiltrate whatever they want.  Not only that, the idea that individual developers can't be served an NSL to prevent commenting on sudden suspicious source commits is absurd.

"It is a fair point, but at some level, you have to wonder when they have gone too far. Right now, the Alphabet agencies can hack pretty much everything which isn't hyper secure, and there is absolutely no way to know if they are hacking us, if they are stealing our information and what not. They are a faceless mass. Do they even work against other agencies? We might presume so, but we can't really confirm. 

I think that the baseline is that they have gone too far. If they keep quiet about certain activities to specifically fight enemy agencies, then it is not ideal, but they don't even do that much. President Obama promised that the government was going to be disclosing critical exploits to the companies, and that simply wasn't done. That means that either Obama lied to everyone, or that no one has control over the agencies, and if no one has control in the first place, then there is absolutely nothing stopping them from doing whatever they want.

Keeping the exploits secret not only goes directly against what they claimed they were going to do, but it also hurts every American citizen whom they kept this from. All of our security is weaker because of this, and our nation is more vulnerable to attacks by foreign adversaries, which is ostensibly the entire goddamn point of having these agencies. There needs to be some kind of reform or change in how they operate, because the current state of affairs is just flat out unacceptable.";5;1;False;Dorgamund;demlo1x;BREAKING: CIA turned every Microsoft Windows PC in the world into spyware.

It would prevent crime in one place but decrease the ability to discover and prevent crime in another place. In the end it should come down to which of the crimes is more dangerous to the general public.

* Compromised private and potentially sensitive data which would, in the worst case, result in financial losses
* Potential breach of privacy by government agencies

"You should read some of the press from the time of the Snowden leaks. It's a combination of legal, unique hardware, and brute force tools that complement typical cryptographic tech, which gives the NSA its edge. While they don't resort to the wrench as far as anyone knows, it's more like the old XKCD comic than not.  It's not ""crack this key, computer"", it's ""sign this other key, sir"". Gag orders and leverage from existing monetary entanglements are the big trump card. Corporations have too much money at stake to risk any of their revenue stream or missing quarterly goals on some legal fight that could existentially threaten those revenue streams. Joe Nacchio of Qwest exemplifies that (he was a criminal, and tried to exploit the secret information to do insider trading; they just pulled the secret rug out from under him and showed enough to the SEC to send him to jail; at that point, he was no longer interested in cooperating, so it's slightly out of order but goes to show how easy it is to lose in that confrontation). There was a large number of very straightforward hardware tools for spying; They sounds unrealistic for any normal person, but using gag orders, shipments would be intercepted and tampered with.

There is very rarely any opportunity to use a brute force directly against cryptography, but it's just not for lack of trying. Every time we read about some bug that needs to be patched, or some configuration peccadillo (key size, etc.) creating a cryptographic weakness, there's also probably some target that's unpatched, making another opportunity they can look at exploiting. There is massive storage dedicated to pitting last year's crypto vs. next year's hardware, too, so supposedly, they will be exploring old troves of encrypted information in the event that they are eventually able to.  That may or may not work but it doubles as a scare tactic to keep people from encrypting data.";4;1;False;jajajajaj;demw1mc;BREAKING: CIA turned every Microsoft Windows PC in the world into spyware.

"That's not entirely true, through, since there are special powers specifically granted to federal agencies.  For example, recently 'Rule 41' has changed during the Obama administration to allow federal agencies expanded powers to access electronic devices (even remotely), as is needed in an increasingly interconnected world to effectively perform their duties: https://www.engadget.com/2016/12/01/rule-41-fbi-doj-hacking-power-expand-search-seizure/

I believe that one warrant (or a FISA warrant) can be applied to any number of devices as long as they are related to an investigation or operation's specific mandate.  And remember, warrants don't even need to be sought by most CIA operations to begin with, because they tend to focus on foreign intelligence gathering (not US citizens).  So it's mostly a non-issue for the agency.  If, through affiliation/contact, they need to expand gathering to a US citizen or citizens, often it is passed to a different agency or a warrant is then needed.

Naturally, it would be counter-intuitive to have to get permission from the targets to do this kind of intelligence gathering, because doing so would tip them off.

"Even 5 years ago I would hand-wave you away as a nut.  

Given the configuration of ignition, throttle, steering, and braking, it would be *impossible* to assuredly cause a car to get out of control.  The experiment done by those two guys and the Jeep is totally invalid.  

That vehicle has a hard mechanical link between steering wheel and the rack, and a hydraulic ps system.  The brakes are mechanically linked, with a booster.  The throttle may be fly-by-wire but there is a mechanical ignition interlock you can control regardless of any computer.  There is a mechanical transmission linkage which can be controlled (put in Neutral) regardless of a computer.  There is a mechanical parking brake independent of the braking system which is completely independent and not electrical at all.  

As of today, the only thing I am sure of is that there is a mechanical rear parking brake on American automobiles.  All other assumptions are off: they in some way can be controlled by computer.

"As a general rule when it comes to the CIA's invasion of computers and cell phones, if you can imagine it, they have done it. They have some very intelligent people working for them who are far more creative and knowledgeable than you and I. Something as simple as a backdoor in Windows or malware for cellphones is just the very tip of the iceberg.

I would say it's highly likely that they've already planted backdoors in the hardware (meaning motherboards, processors and peripherals) that all of our computers run on. If you think you aren't being monitored, you're probably wrong. As much as I hate the invasion of privacy, this is the new face of power. I understand why they are doing it, and I don't believe it to be malicious at its roots. The country who knows more than everyone else has the most power.

The DDI is one of the five major directorates of the CIA. The EDG is responsible for the development, testing and operational support of all backdoors, exploits, malicious payloads, trojans, viruses and any other kind of malware used by the CIA in its covert operations world-wide.

"> In what is surely one of the most astounding intelligence own goals in living memory, the CIA structured its classification regime such that for the most market valuable part of ""Vault 7"" — the CIA's weaponized malware (implants + zero days), Listening Posts (LP), and Command and Control (C2) systems — the agency has little legal recourse.
> 
> The CIA made these systems unclassified.
> 
> Why the CIA chose to make its cyberarsenal unclassified reveals how concepts developed for military use do not easily crossover to the 'battlefield' of cyber 'war'.
> 
> To attack its targets, the CIA usually requires that its implants communicate with their control programs over the internet. If CIA implants, Command & Control and Listening Post software were classified, then CIA officers could be prosecuted or dismissed for violating rules that prohibit placing classified information onto the Internet. Consequently the CIA has secretly made most of its cyber spying/war code unclassified. The U.S. government is not able to assert copyright either, due to restrictions in the U.S. Constitution. This means that cyber 'arms' manufactures and computer hackers can freely ""pirate"" these 'weapons' if they are obtained. The CIA has primarily had to rely on obfuscation to protect its malware secrets.

One of the more interesting passages. The arsenal must not be classified to protect those who deploy it from legal action. This cyberwarfare kit, which can just as easily be used to destroy the US as one of its enemies, is public domain software created and released at US taxpayer expense.

> The CIA's Remote Devices Branch's UMBRAGE group collects and maintains a substantial library of attack techniques 'stolen' from malware produced in other states including the Russian Federation.
> 
> With UMBRAGE and related projects the CIA cannot only increase its total number of attack types but also misdirect attribution by leaving behind the ""fingerprints"" of the groups that the attack techniques were stolen from.
