Ok i'll check... so it's funny how you never commented on the bitcoin sub or mentioned it anywhere until the price started to explode in 2017 despite having them for 4 years before.

Also no mention of when you bought them and why, you know why almost no one had them in 2013? They were useless for the most part and no one cared for them. 2013 was also quite a volatile year with a low of around $13 and a high of almost $1000.

Anyway, not saying you 100% didn't buy them in 2013, just seems fishy that you just randomly bought a worthless (at that point) currency and stayed quiet until it reached thousands and then all of a sudden claim you had them all along...";14;1;False;beeswaxx;e4ysdoc;Cheers!;9au41d;https://i.redd.it/hmzbd5az5qi11.jpg

"> Something that takes an hour to clear is far superior? You realize there's cryptos out there that do hundreds to thousands of transactions per second, right?

You're mixing up two different concepts.  Bitcoin - the currency - is not limited to any particular number of transactions per second nor does it take any particular amount of time to clear.  Bitcoin's blockchain used directly as a payment network does have these limitations.

This is not all that different to the US dollar.  Cash transmits instantly, but Credit Cards take a long time to clear.  Both are USD, just with different payment systems implemented.  Bitcoin can (and does) have different payment systems as well.  I've personally transacted bitcoin:

* On the base blockchain layer
* By handing a printed private key over to someone else
* On the lightning network

> You should be diversifying into other investment vehicles (bonds, index funds, real estate)

Bitcoin isn't an investment to me.  It's my currency.

I do happen to have significant investments as well.

> and a small amount into *various* cryptos.

I have no intention of investing in any cryptocurrencies because I don't think they're a wise investment choice.  I have no intention of using any other existing cryptocurrency because they don't have the properties that I consider to make bitcoin valuable and interesting to me.

> I hate the Federal Reserve too

I don't really hate them.  But then again, I'm not in the US.  If I were, I probably would.  I do consider them an outdated dinosaur relic of a past system that will soon die.

> but your singularly focused exuberance is very reckless and baseless

You seem to be assigning properties to me that I don't have.  I have no singularly focused exuberance for anything really, and especially not a currency.

"you are right I do not agree with the article. Also not interesting because no new counter arguments. I've heard of Bitcoin several times but it was as late as mid 2017 that I digged deeper into it. Even though I was always bullish I also knew it would crash at some point, as many others who are in favor of crypto.  

regarding the article:

1) ""Bitcoin is Tulip bubble 2.0"" --> ehm no. Tulips are no network which get more valuable as they 'grow'. Typical strawmen argument including a logical fallacy. 

2) ""My fingernails are rare too"" --> same as 1)  

3) ""Currently only speculators drive price"" --> yes that's true, and that's true for all investments to some extend.  

4) ""Bitcoin is no investment as it creates no value/returns"" --> Bitcoin is a special case for an investment. It's value increases with network growth and demand for it. As a store of value and transaction method it very much creates value for people.  

5) ""Investing in Bitcoin is a waste of time as you as an investor create no value"" --> The fact that the network gets more valuable as it grows proves the contrary point. As an investor you help the price to increase and in consequence the awareness and adoption to rise. The profit you make is the reward for helping the network to spread over the planet. Profits are high in the early stages as it's the most risky time for the network and they will decrease over time the clearer the victory of Bitcoin as hard money becomes.

Thanks for calling me young.  It's not something I hear face to face a lot what with the lack of hair on my head and the ones on my face all being grey for many years now.

> Come on man, a BTC transaction can cost multiple euros and take hours to process. Even today you're waiting at least 10 minutes on the network and paying each miner a fee. You're just being dishonest.

That's totally incorrect.  On-chain transactions tend to be a few cents at the moment and I usually batch them anyway to send many transactions in one unless it's an ""immediate need"" to send (e.g. getting a beer at the cafe around the corner from where I live).

Regarding the ""hours to process"".  No, they are broadcast to the network immediately and are usually seen within seconds.  Whether the person receiving the bitcoin chooses to trust me after zero confirmations, one, or several is entirely their choice.  The aforementioned bar for example is happy to accept a zero confirmation payment.

That in mind, I don't use on-chain transactions when I can avoid it, which brings me to:

> I shouldn't assume that literally the only way of doing it in the wild is the only way?

Lightning exists.  Small denomination paper wallets as ""notes"" exist.  I use both as much as possible and expect to use Lightning significantly more in the future (and the paper wallet notes hopefully less, since they're insanely low security).

Could you imagine if you were at a local store and swiped your credit card and _had to wait 10 minutes_ ? The current fee is 13,500 satoshi's or about $1USD and is about a ten minute wait. Could you imagine a $1 fee just to swipe a credit card! MADNESS! Your system is not just inferior to fiat, it's about an order of magnitude worse. Or several orders.

"There's a reason the fed aims for 1-2% inflation.  It's a safety margin against the real bad guy-- deflation.   

If we experience deflation, a lot of bad things happen.   

1. My money is growing in value, I'll save it!  Doesn't appear to be bad, but...

2. Hey, if I wait a few more months, or years, that thing I want to buy (car, boat, refrigerator, house, computer, TV, etc.) will be be cheaper, so I'll wait.   Doesn't appear to be bad except...

3. Uh oh, sales of capital products plummet because only people who absolutely need to buy are buying these expensive things.   

4. Uh oh, I need to lay people off because I've got warehouses of stuff that isn't moving.   Also, I better drop the price! 

5.  Prices are dropping, my money is even more valuable, if I wait just a little bit longer... or I'm out of work, better not spend too much.

6.  Governments relying on sales taxes are feeling the pinch now.   Unemployment and welfare getting hit hard. 

7.  Now you've got a lot of people who are hungry, on unemployment or welfare, and production of new goods has all but stopped.

"The goods and services you ""use bitcoin for"" are all pegged instead to USD/fiat, causing the bitcoin value of them to vary dramatically. 

You're gambling on bitcoin because it's not a stable or low-risk investment, it's an extremely high risk and unstable cryptocurrency notorious for its young, naive and strongly addicted fans. 

The gambling occurs potentially in several places. Like when you move USD to crypto and then buy things pegged to USD with it -- the gamble is on attempting arbitrage that the value of the goods and services will be less through bitcoin than through USD. Even if you attempt to just bitcoin as a currency, you're gambling on the arbitrage opportunity whether or not you want to. This is why people who have euros turn them into dollars before spending them in America. Why gamble on every single small purchase? 

The gambling also occurs on any bitcoin you don't spend, as it's quite worthless without being turned into USD or being spent on a USD-pegged good or service, so at some point you have to resolve your gamble and take your USD/USD-pegged result.

And finally, even if, even if you were truly attempting to use bitcoin as a currency only, then you're engaging in the rank stupidity of using an inferior, expensive, laggy, pseudo-currency. That may not be a gamble per se (although I would make an argument that anyone who supports bitcoin at all is gambling by nature), but it's worth pointing out.

"That view of economic theory is one I'll never understand.  It's essentially a more complex version of the broken window fallacy.

Yes, people buy less in a deflationary system; but they still buy what they need *because they need it*.  I spend bitcoin a lot, because if I didn't pay my rent, my landlord would kick me out; and if I didn't buy food, my family and I would starve.  Even on ""wants"", it's still something I can decide.  I wanted a new computer recently, so I bought one.  I wanted a holiday to Tokyo with my family last year, so we went.  If I'd held those BTC, they'd be worth more now than they were; but I knew that would be the case and did it anyway because living a happy life is more important to me than being rich.

The inflationary system encourages spending which is good for the economy until the entire thing collapses under its own weight of waste and useless crap that no one actually wants but everyone gets because otherwise their money will be wasted through no fault of their own.  It's an inherently broken concept in the long run.

It's worth noting that in the short run, inflation can be helpful.  Bitcoin is in fact inflationary (currently 12.5BTC per ~10 minutes).  It's designed however to decrease the inflation over time, until it becomes stable at just under 21 million total coins.  There will then be a small deflationary pressure as coins continue to get lost or destroyed, but this isn't likely to be a lot by then.";1;1;False;dalebewan;e4yy1qr;Cheers!;9au41d;https://i.redd.it/hmzbd5az5qi11.jpg

I don't believe it's a ""complete unknown"". Simply an unknown. It seems highly likely based on all available data that it will increase in value over time.

Ridiculous strawman of my position.  A car isn't something you just hold to trade away later.  You *use* it.  Money is something you don't use except in trade.  Also, you haven't told me anything about the mystery box to help me determine the likelihood of it holding or increasing in value.

"Other than that it's actually EUR rather than USD, most of your post is correct.  I don't really think it's a significant gamble though because the time between earning and spending tends to be low, making the volatility quite irrelevant as a percentage of the total amount.

There are only two parts I'd disagree with:

> The gambling also occurs on any bitcoin you don't spend, as it's quite worthless without being turned into USD or being spent on a USD-pegged good or service, so at some point you have to resolve your gamble and take your USD/USD-pegged result.

I fully expect a time in the future where prices will be denominated in BTC directly.  Perhaps not my lifetime, but within that of my kids (which is why they own 1BTC each, as a gift from me on the day they were born).  Sooner would be nicer, but I can wait.

> And finally, even if, even if you were truly attempting to use bitcoin as a currency only, then you're engaging in the rank stupidity of using an inferior, expensive, laggy, pseudo-currency. That may not be a gamble, but it's worth pointing out.

I completely disagree.  I find BTC much easier to use than euro.  It cuts out the middleman completely (similar to cash, but I can transact it remotely, unlike cash).

It's also important not to confuse the payment system with the currency.  Credit cards that spend USD are spending the same currency as a cash purchase in USD, just over a different payment system.  Credit card payment systems require clearing time, have middle-men, but can be done remotely.  Cash payment requires no clearing time, is peer to peer, but can only be done locally.  Just as USD, EUR, and other fiat currencies can have many payment systems for transacting them, this is also true of bitcoin.  You shouldn't just assume on-chain ledger entries with block confirmation are the only way that bitcoin can be transacted.";1;1;False;dalebewan;e4yxc9p;Cheers!;9au41d;https://i.redd.it/hmzbd5az5qi11.jpg

They are not particularly smart, and I recall them brigading this subreddit quite often back when Bitcoin was only $200.

As with any investments, on average, you will always lose money to those who can/do spend more time and effort than you to learn and make informed predictions. The money isn't free, it just changes hands to those more adept with the market. If you can beat the average trader (weighted by volume) in their understanding of the technology and economy, then you could potentially make money, on average. But that is only an average, and you can easily stand to lose big either way (or win, if you are lucky, but gambling is not a prudent path to get rich). But remember there are many professionals out there trading in high volumes, so you need to be at least mostly as smart as them for any luck at all to be in your favor.;3;1;False;Keavon;e4yqq7g;Cheers!;9au41d;https://i.redd.it/hmzbd5az5qi11.jpg

This year's rally has the potential for other cryptos to make Bitcoin irrelevant. It also has the potential to go to a whopping 10k and then back to 4k.

I think most of the investors here who have a decent amount of BTC are semi-wealthy people just diversifying their holdings.  I have about 7% of my net worth in BTC just in case it does skyrocket (or USD tanks), and if BTC crashes then I'll still be fine.   ;1;0;False;softawre;e4zchg4;Cheers!;9au41d;https://i.redd.it/hmzbd5az5qi11.jpg

Just think of like if you cut a nickle up into 6 pieces, gave 2 away to your friends, 2 down the well, and the other two you sharpened down so they become a shiv and rob someone and take the $10 in their wallet. Then you take the other 2 pieces back from your friends and when they ask where they can get more you push them down the well. ;18;1;False;Everyone__Dies;e4yrgbi;Cheers!;9au41d;https://i.redd.it/hmzbd5az5qi11.jpg

"most importantly:  

1) Bitcoin is hard money with virtually uncorruptable limited supply. It's purely digital but harder than gold.  

2) Bitcoin is a decentralized network, which allows to transfer money peer-to-peer without the use of a bank. Just like giving cash to someone. The decentralized property also prevents corrupt people to change Bitcoin to their advantage.  ";0;1;False;Hanspanzer;e4yrq9a;Cheers!;9au41d;https://i.redd.it/hmzbd5az5qi11.jpg
