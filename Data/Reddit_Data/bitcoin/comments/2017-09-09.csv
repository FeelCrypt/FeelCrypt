The Carl Force guy was with the DEA, and his actions meant the DEA investigation was tainted. However that didn't affect the parallel FBI investigation.;1;0;False;jcancelmo;dmrwcd1;Hi, my name is Ross Ulbricht;6cp2ql;https://i.redd.it/djb8i3hoh3zy.jpg

There were two separate investigations, the FBI investigation and the DEA investigation.

Carl Force, the corrupt agent, was heading the DEA investigation. His actions caused that one to be tainted, but it was the separate FBI investigation which nabbed Ulbricht.

However the federal prosecutors did use Ulbricht's reactions to Force's threats against him in his trial.";1;1;False;jcancelmo;dmrwemv;Hi, my name is Ross Ulbricht;6cp2ql;https://i.redd.it/djb8i3hoh3zy.jpg
Loans at the moment effectively have inflation rate built into the interest charged, so if we had a deflationary economy they could account for that in reverse by reducing interest rates down accordingly (even into negative rates, loan provider still wins in the same way because the currency is increasing in value, it's all relative).;1;1;False;petriecg;dmr6gl7;The difference between inflation and deflation...;6yn8hs;https://i.redd.it/zs4byvahrgkz.jpg

I mean, you don't have to spend. You can invest. Which is what you are doing with bitcoin, especially if you don't spend it. If no company grew an index would still track inflation, because networth would match it. I also would like to see why it should be deflationary instead of just retaining value. It should theoretically only seem deflationary when compared to an inflating dollar, no?;1;0;False;;dmrpvav;The difference between inflation and deflation...;6yn8hs;https://i.redd.it/zs4byvahrgkz.jpg

"Well I over simplified. It's value comes from the fact that it is a currency that cannot be manipulated or inflated by any government. So it is safe from political influence. (At least more than fiat anyway)

Also it is pseudonymous and transfers are far faster than traditional bank transfers. And the ledger is fully public, so even though users aren't identified anyone can still validate that every transaction is legitimate. So no need for a trusted intermediary. You can do everything yourself and don't need to trust anyone in the process. You don't even need to trust the person you are transacting with or even know who you are dealing with, and can still trust that the system will work fairly. 

So I think that is where its true value is. The rare thing is just an extra. 

Yes it is bits, but not in the cloud as that term is normally used ie not in datacenter servers. It is on individual desktops and specialized hardware owned by anyone who wants to run it. 

Also even though it is bits doesn't mean it can be copied infinitely to make more. The rules of the ledger still apply, and all network participants have to agree to accept any changes. So one can't just invent  infinite money out of thin air with it. Which is another value -- satoshi made a system that takes advantage of all the benefits of being digital without sacrificing the integrity required in a currency system.

"You just responded for me. Economic stagnation has led to social issues, which has contributed to the population decline. And a declining population creates further economic issues.

Though upon thinking about it for a second longer i suppose what incentive is there to lend if you will lose money, guess that will require a non profit lender to work.;1;0;False;petriecg;dmr6jef;The difference between inflation and deflation...;6yn8hs;https://i.redd.it/zs4byvahrgkz.jpg
I'd agree, but economies are emergent, caused by the individual choices of millions. The central bank can influence by acting through the banking system but individuals can decide to spend a lot of money on tech stocks and real estate if they like. Unpredictability is inherent due to our uncertainty about the future and beliefs of consumers. If tomorrow people thought inflation would be 10% it would devalue the currency when nothing has really changed. You can see the impact through things like the false Chinese ban news today causing bitcoin to drop.;1;0;False;linklitter;dmrmxed;The difference between inflation and deflation...;6yn8hs;https://i.redd.it/zs4byvahrgkz.jpg
"Most economists would say it's better to have moderate but constant economic growth, than erratic growth (boom and bust cycles).

So, no, doing everything to push toward growth, growth, growth at all cost isn't necessarily better if it causes a severe recession every decade or so. And this recession cancels all the super-growth you have achieved the preceding years anyway.

Look at the US, it's a perfect example of what can go wrong: the dot com bust of 2000, and financial crisis of 2008 have severly disrupted the lives of millions and created tons of social problems. I would have rather traded all this chaos for a more constant moderate annual economic growth of 1%  through the last 20 years...";1;1;False;_mrb;dmrg10s;The difference between inflation and deflation...;6yn8hs;https://i.redd.it/zs4byvahrgkz.jpg

If the world's population increases from 7 billion to say 10 billion and the amount of bitcoins stays the same the currency will continue to be a deflationary currency until population growth stops.

"Oh but they would.  Not all employers would have the courage to do it but the large ones would, and for those that didn't you would be forced to face the practical reality of no raises, and an environment where if you lost your job you may not, in fact probably would not, be able to find one that paid as well as your old one did let alone better. 

Even in your own example, stagnant wages coupled with unemployment and/or casualisation is in effect a net drop in wages.  If I tell you I am going to still pay you the same amount per hour, but now I can only have you come in for 35 hours per week, I have just essentially cut your wages.

So long story short, owing debt in a deflationary currency, particularly an aggressively deflationary one (as BTC will be for a long time), is a very bad idea - for the lender too by the way. 

One other thing, even under more inflationary fiat currencies wages do stagnate or occasionally go down but this is rare.  Ordinarily nominal wages increase over time even if real wages remain stagnant as they have for some professions for a long time.  In principle, if we assume real wages are steady, nominal wages will increase over time under an inflationary currency and will decrease over time under a deflationary currency.

edit: typo, and point about inflationary currency and wages.";1;0;False;grandaha;dmrmu4s;The difference between inflation and deflation...;6yn8hs;https://i.redd.it/zs4byvahrgkz.jpg
No employer would reduce your wage overtime, it doesn't happen in the current inflationary world either.  Rather the wages stagnate, or they move to casualisation but the rate doesn't change and in that case if your wages are paid in BTC you'd be fine, as I said.;1;1;False;smithy006;dmrgbdi;The difference between inflation and deflation...;6yn8hs;https://i.redd.it/zs4byvahrgkz.jpg
