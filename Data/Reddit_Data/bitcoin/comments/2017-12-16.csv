"Hey, you were the one who first said ""I can't even respond to this"" to perfectly reasonable statements.

But I think I've diagnosed you: your ego is so wrapped up in the notion that higher education makes you superior that the existence of people who don't esteem it as highly is an affront to you. That someone might possess a point of view you hadn't considered is a personal insult: after all, you can't stop talking about how much better your ability to discern ""nuance"" is than those filthy, uneducated plebians. That your own arguments are fallacious is irrelevant, after all, you're educated; even if what you said is wrong, *you*'re still right.

How dare dissenters not pursue education for as intellectual of reasons! How dare an engineer pursue the study of physics, not to critique literature, but to learn to create labor-saving devices! How dare an entrepreneur study business, not to ""fight the status quo"", but to provide for himself and his family! How dare a doctor pursue the study of medicine, not to consider Marx, but to heal the sick! *How dare they pursue education not for its own sake, but as a tool to better the world? Don't they know that the purpose of education is to place themselves on a pedestal and silence opposition?*";1;1;False;pwag42;drb8y7h;Nothing can increase by that much and still be a good investment.;7jht7c;https://i.imgur.com/oWePY7q.jpg

They have achieved LOADS... They developed the open source and now global Satnogs platform which is a network of groundstations enabling reliable and independent ways of collecting even more scientific data from satellites.... They built and launched UPsat a small form satellite (Currently zipping around our planet once every 90 minutes on orbit!) The development of UPsat is about creating an open source reliable cubesat satellite platform for EVERYONE to use.
From meeting some of this team recently and chatting to them on their forum they are currently researching the development of an open source space launch system for nanosatellite payloads (think ROCKETS!) and are working on ways to increase their engagement and outreach activities with many different communities globally.

"Dear [u/PineappleFund](https://www.reddit.com/user/PineappleFund), I hope you have a little time to see a 5 minute youtube video called [Why Die?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C25qzDhGLx8) and a 7 minute video called [Why Age?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoJsr4IwCm4) and will be convinced, like I am, that aging really is the biggest problem in the world today. It causes far more suffering and death than any other cause, or even all other causes combined, both in developed and in developing countries. I see that you have already made a great donation to SENS Research Foundation, that supports the most effective way forward to bring aging under medical control - that is addressing directly the types of damage that cause aging. It is beautiful and visionary that you have already chosen to support the work of SENS. I wish you will consider allocating to SENS an even bigger part of your donations, taking into account that aging really is the world's biggest problem, causing 100.000 deaths every day, and constant pain, suffering and indignity to millions more.

"Consider donating to the organization I work for: Foresight Institute, a non-profit institute focused on advancing the benefits, and avoiding the dangers of technologies of fundamental importance for the human future, e.g. molecular machines, longevity, cybersecurity, AI, and blockchains.

We’re a small organization but have a lot on our plate: 

- we do research on neglected risks, especially AI safety & cybersecurity and host private workshops, e.g. on AI Policy with MIRI, EFF, OpenAI, Google Brain, Future of Life Institute, Future of Humanity Institute, and other Ai safety orgs
--> Your donation would allow us to host additional meetings, which were requested by participants (requested topics: open vs close AI safety research, cybersecurity as catastrophic risk)
- We award the Feynman Prizes and the Foresight Fellowship to brilliant scientists to further their work in underfunded projects. Our 2007 Feynman Prize winner, Sir Fraser Stoddart won the shared Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2016 for his work in molecular machines.
--> Your donation would allow us to invite our prodigies to our gatherings so they can participate, present their work, and connect with mentors.

- We host invitational workshops to push for progress in specific scientific fields, e.g. longevity, AI, atomic precision. Previous workshop was described as ""the most interesting conference I have attended in years” by John Koza, Pioneer of Genetic Programming. 
--> Your donation would allow us to host two workshops next year, Nobel Prize Laureate Fraser Stoddart has agreed to chair the first workshop in May 2018 on Molecular Machines.

- we host salons free to the public and our Vision Weekend to get to work on topics of fundamental importance to our future. E.g. on ""Blockchain: The Next Frontier"" including Arthur Breitman, Tezos, Zooko Wilcox, ZCash, Jorge Lopez, ESCA, Mark Miller, Foresight Institute  ""Long-term thinking: The Tools To Make It Beyond The Century"" including Joon Yun, Palo Alto Investors, Tom Kalil, previous White House Office for Science & Technology, Melanie Swan, Institute for Blockchain Studies, ""Longevity: Reaching Escape Velocity"" with Aubrey De Grey, SENS, Sonia Arrison, Thiel Foundation, Max More, Alcor Life Extension, Kevin Perrott, Buck Institute, and more than 10 further topics.
--> Your donation would allow us to keep the always “sold-out’ salons free to the public and offer income-support for Vision Weekend.

- we collect a collaborative knowledge graph to steer humanity toward positive long-term futures at existentialhope.com
--> Your donation would allow us to ask experts in different fields (e.g. asteroid mining) to populate sub-sections of the index and recruit brilliant people to work on more long-term projects

For a full list of 2017 achievements and how your donation would allow us to continue each project in 2018, see https://foresight.org/donate.";1;0;False;seagrubb;drbamey;I'm donating 5057 BTC to charitable causes!

"Please elaborate where have we met? 

And why are you saying this? If I didn’t care about helping people in need I would have never started this project.

I was three times in Munich CCC hackerspace showing progress of project and looking if there are people interested to join this project. Did we meet there?

This is fully open source project so there is no way any single person can benefit from this. We have intentionally kept everything fully open source.

If my goal was to get money I could have gotten it many times - but all investors only understand parents and proprietary projects. That is why this project has been self financed by me so far - to keep it fully open source to the core.

You can see all of our progress and what we did in last two years. Also our team members are also now contributing to Lede and OpenWrt projects.

So again I’m kindly asking you to explain where we met.

If you have been in middle of crisis situation with thousands where refugees that were arriving were totally lost and didn’t know where they arrived and where they were going because complete 3G and LTE infrastructure failed so they couldn’t use their phones to open google maps or to let their friends and families know they are alright.

We can give anyone who is interested contacts from humanitarian organisations that we worked with to provide free Wi-Fi to check with them if we charged them anything or if we volunteered and helped then with providing free Wi-Fi.

Some of organisations that we helped are Red Cross, Greenpeace, Jesuit Rescue Service, Mountain Rescue Service, Refugees Welcome and lots of small NGOs.

I can provide contacts form all of these organisations for anyone interested in double checking anything what we did and if we did this as volunteers or not.

We created Seeds Tokens (www.seedstokens.com) to allow tokenholders to ask the blockchain for help - and receive it - no strings attached.

In part because 96%+ of the BTC wealth is held by 4% of the addresses - perpetuating the same wealth disparity challenge in fiat - we're working to be mindful of doing whatever we can to get Seeds Tokens in the hands of as many diverse groups of people as possible.  

Each tokenholder can then makes a Needs Request to our system of front-end products, which have been integrated into about 30 apps, and it will be gifted to him/her, no strings attached.  It's a bit like a decentralized GoFundMe.

In 2013, I sold off my personal BTC holding to keep Seeds going when investors were ignoring us, often at least in part because of misogyny in institutionalized finance.

Now, I want to solve the problem of lack of funds due to discrimination - for all of us.  I believe we've found an effective way to do this at scale through the Seeds tokens vehicle.

However, we are not a non-profit, which was a philosophic choice.  I think the non-profit/for-profit binary was manufactured primarily for tax reasons in the US, and it has unfortunately led to rampant greed and zero-sum thinking in the for-profit space in too many cases, and lack of resourcing and efficiency in the non-profit sector in too many cases as well.

I believe Seeds can transcend that, creating a new paradigm - a system of abundance.

If this resonates with you, we'd be so grateful if you would be interested in engaging with us in whatever capacity feels appropriate to you.  

Regardless, thank you so much again for doing what you do!  Happy Holidays!";1;0;False;baerbelleksa;drcg7lp;I'm donating 5057 BTC to charitable causes! Introducing The Pineapple Fund;7jj0oa;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7jj0oa/im_donating_5057_btc_to_charitable_causes/

"Generally speaking. Yusus, you can't say anything these days without being ripped to pieces. All I was trying to do was portray the severity of the situation to allow others to understand that it is a good cause to donate in order to help others.
Can't even do that these days with people judging you all over the place. If everyone is so judgemental what's the point of social media to create awareness when no one wants to hear you or you get shot down every sentence you make?
I do not understand why people use social media as a weapon to destroy others. And it  is mainly used as a method to hide behind distant walls in order to hurt others (which shows how small you actually are as a person where you cannot do that in real life).

"You could consider allocating a portion of the fund to creating incentive-packages for scientific breakthroughs. Instead of donating the funds to use directly (working capital) you create prize rewards for solving a specific problem. Much like e.g. the 1 million USD Millennium Prize Problems, but then to problems that are more directly beneficial for humanity (thinks like: photovoltaic cells for solar power with a specific yield for less than a specific cost, method for detecting cancer with specific accuracy and cost, desalination of water below specific costs, etc.).
Set a specific amount of bitcoin aside for each solved problem such that maybe in 10 years there is an enormous financial incentive to solve it. Like that you can spread the impact of your fund over many more years.

Problem definition in coorperation with reputable scientific journals (Nature, Cell, etc) and their readers. Safekeeping and verification of problem solving by several of the top reputable law-firms and funds in multisig wallet.

"For climate change, human health and animal rights, Good Food Institute has huge potential if properly funded. It works on supporting companies developing plant-based and lab-based meats. The lab-based meats are grown from cells, with (eventually) no animal involvement past that point. The goal is to get these meats below the cost of regular meat, healthier, and tastier. They're close already, with lab-grown burgers at $11 and clean of any growth hormones etc. used in normal farming, and good reviews on the taste. Researchers in the area have identified some concrete blockers like developing a commercial cell food to drop prices further - donations now could hugely speed up adoption and save lives.

The thing I like best about this charity is it targets all these high-impact areas, in a way no-one else is doing:

1. Climate Change: lab-grown meats use 90% less resources (land, water) than regular, and don't produce methane since no actual animals are involved.

2. Human Health: These meats can be engineered more easily to contain higher levels of protein, vitamins and not to contain the growth hormones and similar used in most modern farming

3. Animals: factory farming is gruesome. I'll be glad to see it go.

Hope you get a chance to give it a look :-) It's one of those areas where the rate of progress makes you do a double take";2;0;False;Arathiam;drbvfxl;I'm donating 5057 BTC to charitable causes!

"I got in very recently and my investment has already doubled. I started to pull a little out a week ago, which reduced my gains, but I don’t feel bad about it, I needed to have some safe money in case of a huge crash. 

Thing is... at this point the value of my investment is just a few hundred dollars short of the balance of a credit card I’ve been paying interest on for a long time. Paying off that card would be a huge personal financial milestone for me; I can’t recall the last time in my life I was totally free of credit card debt. Of course I’d still be totally buried in student debt, plus my car loan and mortgage, so it’s not like paying off that one account would radically change my life. But it would be pretty nice to pay off a debt with free money from the internet. 

I think I’m going to hodl just a little while longer and then do exactly that. It’s really exciting watching my tiny little nest egg grow. At one point I was thinking of continuing to invest in it aggressively. But as I learn more about Bitcoin I’m less confident in its utility as a regular currency because of transaction time and cost concerns. I’m not sure what will happen when the big rewards for mining stop - will transaction fees go up even more? All of this really sours my optimism. I think it’s only real future is as a large-scale store of value and I’m not certain it won’t be supplanted by something better. So maybe it’s a good idea to get out before more investors have the same thoughts.

"But what if it's worth 20 percent more?

The big catch with Bitcoin, at least if it catches on, is that the demand will always outstrip the supply. It literally can't keep up because there's a hard limit on BTC. Now that assumes that it does in fact make itself a viable currency, but for a lot of people that risk is worthwhile given the potential outcome.

This isn't a coin flip, it's a proposition that you could potentially be looking a situation where the currency you're investing in now has 10 to 20 times that value in the future.

Statistically speaking, that's incorrect. Yes, there's a 1/26 chance your case contains a million, and IF Howie removed 24 other cases for you and said either yours or the remaining had a million then it'd be much more likely the other case has a million.

If this does become a viable currency in the future to the level of credit or Fiat, suddenly things become very interesting. The demand for these coins is surely going to rise, but unlike nearly every other economy, it's literally impossile for supply to scale up, which means it's value continues to rise.

Even after its bubble it won't crash. It'll shrink into a #10 level market cap and people will still invest in it but it won't be the big thing. It'll be a dead coin to most but It'll still be higher in value that a lot of other coins. Bit coin won't hit 0. It won't fall to 1 over night. People have such unrealistic ideas of what will happen. The bubble (IMO) won't happen until it gets to .5mil or multi million. I think it'll happen on a day were the price goes up so high in one day, that it creates massive swings of buys and sells and it'll be a circus to the likes of which we haven't seen. It's volatility will get so great that the coin basically explodes.......that's when alt coins see a tidal wave of influx from investors and the whole game changes. 2019, 2020. Just my guess.

">No consensus is the rules the nodes agree upon

Exactly.   Nodes == miners .... and so consensus = miners = hash power.

It is only those nodes which are enforcing the rules of the block chain, AND participating in adding new blocks (ie. proving hash power), which do anything relevant.

.... and so for Bitcoin Cash to have any ""consensus"" .... it needs to have enough hash power on its chain.  Which it does.

If it did not, it would be dead.  ie.  no support from anyone.

>Bcash is an altcoin

Sure.... but you must understand WHY.   Bitcoin added segwit (and allowed the block size to become a unintended limitation) .... so Bitcoin Cash forked, and this is exactly what the vocal supporters of small blocks and high fees ASKED for.

So don't be salty about it.    You got what you wanted, enjoy your BTC chain.   To any person with knowledge of the history and a 3 digit IQ, BCH looks more like the 'original' bitcoin, so I hope it gets the adoption it deserves.";1;1;False;davewantsmoore;drcnnka;"Starting a new company called Apple Unlimited!

An old node that runs in the BTC-network will still see everything as valid (even though it's useless if it didn't implement segwit).

"I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you’re referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I’ve recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.
Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called “Linux”, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project. There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use.
Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine’s resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called “Linux” distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux.";28;2;False;HelloImRich;drb9nqw;"Starting a new company called Apple Unlimited!

"Where are all these people who got tricked and confused into buy bitcoin cash? Did they get tricked into bitcoin gold? Bitcoin platinum? Any exchange where you can get bitcoin gold also have bitcoin cash. Most USD exchanges you can only trade for bitcoin. No one is getting confused and coming into crypto accidentally with a bunch of bitcoin cash. 

Also, who gives a shit about market cap? Your exact same argument applies to bitcoin too, with estimates as much as 30% or more have been lost. It didn’t “magically” come into existence anymore than half of bitcoins market cap “magically” came into existence this last month. 

The exact same thing that pumped bitcoin cash is the same thing that pumped bit coin up: other people wanting to buy it. That’s it. Bitcoin isn’t any better in that regard other than it was first. People either like the technology and direction of the project or they just think they can print money with it. 

Holy shit, seriously. Pot, this is kettle. Everyone of your complaints, save the flimsy one about the name, *literally* applies to bitcoin too.

"Let’s say I don’t like the way the TCP/IP protocol does some things. If I fork the codebase and then make some changes, it’s perfectly acceptable to call it TCP/IP Swift or whatever. This is very very common in open source projects when things share so much of the same code base. It doesn’t need to be a point of contention. 

Look at cocos-2D and cocos-2D-x. They are both cocos-2D. Nobody’s bitching about which is the real cocos-2D. They’re seeing what the other does well and implementing and improving as needed. 

Look at FreeBSD Linux, Linux, Unix, a jillion other flavors. They are all Linux/Unix. Nobody’s arguing which is the real Linux, instead they’re comparing features a design philosophy. 

This is not abnormal at all. Arguing about whether something it the “real” bitcoin is entirely counter-productive. What is this going to prove? It doesn’t inherently make one superior than the other.

"BITCOIN vs BITCOIN CASH, THE BRANDING EXPLAINED ( I'm neither pro Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash, this was a impartial text I wrote based on facts, sources are only the whitepapers and information relating to Segwit and Segwit2x.) 

Bitcoin is the real Bitcoin at it was started however as adoption grew Bitcoin needed to come up with a scalability solution to both speed transactions confirmation times and to reduce transaction fees. As Bitcoin is open source the community with vested interests are the ones who decide the future of the project. 

Bitcoin came up with two potential scalability solutions.

Option A: To  increase block size from 1mb to 8mb , thus allowing transactions to be confirmed faster and keeping fees low. This was a simple solution and although more like a band-aid to the overall problem of scalability it arguably does the job for the time being. This option would have been consistent with the original Bitcoin whitepaper. 

Option B : Segwit, removing signatures from the 1mb blocks to allow more transactions into this block, thus allowing more transactions to be confirmed quicker. This was not consistent with the original Bitcoin whitepaper and in theory decreases security. There was also the idea of using side chains which in reality are basically using IOU ( i owe you ) tokens which would then be credit to the user after processing of a transaction. Also very controversial as it would be giving power and control to the companies responsible for these side chains ( block stream). Segwit2x was basically the same idea but doubling the block size from the current 1mb. 

The problem was then to decide the next step. Part of the Bitcoin community which aligned with option A forked Bitcoin. 
Because this fork happened prior to a 51% decision taking place this fork had to name their project, the name chosen was Bitcoin Cash.

Bitcoin remained the same and thus kept the name of Bitcoin. Segwit2x  did not go ahead and technically speaking Bitcoin is the ""REAL"" Bitcoin as no changes have really happened and the majority was still behind it. 

In generic terms both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash are actually BITCOIN. 

If Bitcoin goes ahead with sidechains and Segwit2x, in theory this would not be the
 ""REAL"" Bitcoin as the vision of the project would have drastically changed from the original project.  In that case Bitcoin Cash would technically be the original Bitcoin but it can't ever claim the name Bitcoin because it forked without a majority vote.

The problem here is that Bitcoin is not a company, it is not run by any specific entity. It is intended to be used as a means of exchange, a digital deflationary substitute for CASH.  

Bitcoin Cash is not going to be the real Bitcoin in branding because it forked without a majority vote, but it technically is in its core.

I'm not saying BCH is bad but by forking the chain, taking on Bitcoin brand recognition and getting into the top 10 coins - it could cause issues. A couple of those things, no.

The problem is I have no more confidence in the BCH dev team than I do in the Bitcoin dev team. If I cared enough, I would research both. But instead, I've diversified a bit into altcoins.

Perhaps if I did look into the merits, I would instantly agree with you and claim that BTC is far superior to BCH and that it is ""a shitcoin worse than fiat"", but, again, I have had no interest in looking into that yet.

You are aware that just because you truly believe in something (even if you have all the technical reasons to do so), it doesn't mean that everything related to it is right, yeah? This comparison is a bad one. This doesn't take away any technical merits or superiority that BTC may have -- it just means that whoever made this comparison was either intentionally intellectually dishonest, or just very, very, very slow.

What you have exhibited here is dogma, coupled with insecurity. Why are you so personally offended by the fact that this one person, despite possibly being ""on the right camp"", made what can only be described as an ""incredibly shitty comparison""? Just relax, your beloved coin is not being questioned here, just OP's mental health and/or intentions.

EDIT: I'd like to point out that this comparison is indeed so bad that the Mac Operating System (as well as iOS, watchOS, tvOS) is a fork of two extremely well known open-source projects known as FreeBSD and Mach, forming the XNU kernel, which is the basis of MacOS, which is then itself the basis of iOS, etc. It's just incredibly funny that macOS is a heavily modified fork of other operating systems and its parent company was used for this example. Note that I am also not saying that macOS's case is comparable to the BTC/BCH one (e.g. naming issues, etc). You are capable of that much basic reading comprehension, right?";1;0;False;jorl17;drbsjg4;"Starting a new company called Apple Unlimited! Please don't confuse this with our competitor, Apple.

"Exactly. And this is fine. Anyone can fork Bitcoin, anyone can make an altcoin, etc. The market will decide.

The only people who care which fork wins are the people who sell off the ""bad guy coins"" because they think they've got it figured out. Its not a religion people, its a new asset class. Bitcoin has already tipped above 20k if you hold your own private keys and don't pay enough attention to coin politics to bother selling.

Everyone is assuming that there will be one true Bitcoin that hits 100k or 1M or whatever - maybe it'll be 20 different branches that sum to that amount? Maybe something else will take over?

"**Apple Corps v Apple Computer**

Between 1978 and 2006 there were a number of legal disputes between Apple Corps (owned by The Beatles) and the computer manufacturer Apple Computer (now Apple Inc.) over competing trademark rights. The High Court of Justice handed down a judgment on 8 May 2006 in favour of Apple Computer, but the companies did not announce a final settlement until 5 February 2007.

BTC/Crypto Prediction *Put Tin Foil Hat On and buckle up*:

Crypto was released with no one knowing the name of the true creator. The intent of this release was to engineer consent among people who would normally be skeptical about buying and selling using a digital asset. The release enables people to feel like they are fighting against international governments and banks, and the whole time they are innovating and creating newer,better, and more advanced blockchains. Essentially they are creating the very thing that will enslave them and all the while they think they are fighting against the system.

Fast Forward: BTC/Crypto reaches fever pitch media attention right as a world economic collapse happens, people run to crypto currency for refuge during times of the crisis because it has gained popularity and consensus as a real alternative. BOOM The exchanges and assets are seized,seemingly overnight, and converged into the most advanced and controllable coin that the powers that be have created through the innovations of the free market.
Suddenly, Crypto is now the only form of currency that is allowed by governmental entities worldwide because it is fully traceable and everything about every transaction is recorded on the ledger, I.E., no more untaxed money in the form of cash can ever exist. Now the mega banks have engineered consent, normalized a digital currency, and have seized full control of the currency, all without anyone fighting the system. ByeBye Freedom and Hello microchip. You just built your own prison.

I'm unsure how much you know about fractional reserve, but the basic gist is that banks can lend out 10x the amount of money they actually have in reserve,  because there are measures in place to stop a bank run. What this means is that a bank can collect interest on 10 loans for the price of 1. With blockchain currencies, they can't lend out more money than they have, unless it's in a different currency, so they either need to foster a culture of having many different types of currencies, one which they control, or just lend out only what they actually have.

"Because now banks hold all the power over your money.  They, or the government, can cancel your credit card, freeze your bank account, and even refuse to accept cash payments because those bills you got from an ATM machine might (or might not be) counterfeit.

With Bitcoin you are your own bank (unless you are uneducated and leave your bitcoin in a wallet belonging to an exchange).

Bitcoin has been called the money of the internet.  Just as internet shopping has decimated brick-and-mortar shopping (for better or worse), so will the banks fall to Bitcoin.  The protests were indeed about shady investment practices and predatory lending.  Bitcoin will not make them change their ways, it will simply, and in large part, end their reign.  (At least that is the hope.)  It isn't about a re-distribution of wealth; it is about returning autonomy to everyone (rich or poor) who uses money by removing the central controlling authority. 

Andreas Antonopoulos describes this process in greater detail and with an eloquence I can't begin to match.  I'd suggest watching his youtube videos for a better explanation.

Occupy Wall Street was not just about bank bailouts, it was also about addressing systemic wealth inequality due to capitalism, i.e. ""We are the 99%.""

Bitcoin is recreating the same old inequalities because it is simply rearranging the demographics of the 1% vs. 99%. Bitcoin may dismantle central banks, but it will also exacerbate global wealth inequality and governments will start asserting their authority in harsher ways as they lose control of the money supply.

"**Two Treatises of Government**

Two Treatises of Government (or Two Treatises of Government: In the Former, The False Principles, and Foundation of Sir Robert Filmer, and His Followers, Are Detected and Overthrown. The Latter Is an Essay Concerning The True Original, Extent, and End of Civil Government) is a work of political philosophy published anonymously in 1689 by John Locke. The First Treatise attacks patriarchalism in the form of sentence-by-sentence refutation of Robert Filmer's Patriarcha, while the Second Treatise outlines Locke's ideas for a more civilized society based on natural rights and contract theory.

This publication contrasts former political works by Locke himself.

**French Revolution**

The French Revolution (French: Révolution française [ʁevɔlysjɔ̃ fʁɑ̃sɛːz]) was a period of far-reaching social and political upheaval in France that lasted from 1789 until 1799, and was partially carried forward by Napoleon during the later expansion of the French Empire. The Revolution overthrew the monarchy, established a republic, experienced violent periods of political turmoil, and finally culminated in a dictatorship under Napoleon that rapidly brought many of its principles to Western Europe and beyond. Inspired by liberal and radical ideas, the Revolution profoundly altered the course of modern history, triggering the global decline of absolute monarchies while replacing them with republics and liberal democracies. Through the Revolutionary Wars, it unleashed a wave of global conflicts that extended from the Caribbean to the Middle East.

**Agrarian Justice**

Agrarian Justice is the title of a pamphlet written by Thomas Paine and published in 1797, which proposed that those who possess cultivated land owe the community a ground rent, and that this justifies an estate tax to fund universal old-age and disability pensions, as well as a fixed sum to be paid to all citizens upon reaching maturity.

It was written in the winter of 1795–96, but remained unpublished for a year, Paine being undecided whether or not it would be best to wait until the end of the ongoing war with France before publishing. However, having read a sermon by Richard Watson, the Bishop of Llandaff, which discussed the ""Wisdom ... of God, in having made both Rich and Poor"", he felt the need to publish, under the argument that ""rich"" and ""poor"" were arbitrary divisions, not divinely created ones.

2. The smartest financially minded people in  the world running analytics and forecasts.
3. Access to a network of people who are deeply in ‘the know’. For 99% of things, they learn about them before everyone else because they’re better connected to sources that info comes from.

"On the contrary, Librtarian socialism is a subset of socialism; the term libertarian was invented by the socialist  thinker Joseph Dejacque in order to distinguish his ideas from those of other early socialists who he saw as less radical in their critique of capitalism — and thus more authoritarian. He used the term libertarian to distinguish his understanding of liberty from that of contemporary liberals, as liberalsim was seen as antithetical to socialism. 

The modern understanding of the term — what you might cal right liberarianism — emerged much later, but for similar reasons, out of a desire from the right to define their classically liberal ideology without reference to liberalism, which had by that point evolved to become associated with the left in the US — and to a lesser extent elsewhere in the Anglo sphere. 

Nowadays because distinctions between socialists aren't terribly relevant to mainstream politics, the term is primarily identified with the right-libertarianism that emerged later, but it was still used to describe a type of socialism in the original instance. The only thing these two uses of the term really have in common is a desire to express a conception of liberty different from that professed by the liberals of the day.

"Who’s funding, though? The reason loans go through banks now is because they have an incredible availability of capital via deposits. If that’s not the case, lending would be much, much harder to come by

On top of that, fully-collateralized smart contracts are in no way a necessary element of bitcoin. There exists a world where uncollateraized loans and bitcoins are used in harmony. Hell, there exists a world where uncollateralized loans, bitcoins, and fully-collateralized smart contracts exist together

Think about this: say a company wants to issue a bond. They find investors and put together a smart contract. The investors pay them 100 btc. Oh wait—to fully collateralize that, they have to put down 100 btc and therefore have no way of effectively raising capital

What about non-bitcoin collateral? Smart contracts have no way of repossessing physical assets. Besides, even if they did, it would just be a more efficient version of the system we currently have. Escrow already exists (as do collateralized loans), and they work *most* of the time. Smart contracts are thus a process improvement, not a different system 

Smart contracts are therefore only useful in manner of “I will pay out a set amount of money if certain conditions are met.” They are in no way revolutionary in how we lend lump-sum capital on the promise of future cash flow. That’s still as variable as ever, because a smart contract can’t take money out of an account if that account is empty 

As such, if smart contracts were the only means of lending, credit would be insanely constricted and the market would slow down immeasurably 

It’s interesting to me that a technology based on libertarian ideals is so blatantly anti-free credit ";2;1;False;necrow;drba6cx;Bitcoin is the real Occupy Wall Street.;7jytuc;https://twitter.com/JulianAssange/status/941600368588476416
Not being argumentative, but honestly curious about the thought process here... How will bitcoin bring them down? The banks on Wall Street are investment houses and the protests (to me) seemed more about shady investment practices, not necessarily the fees on wiring money. Doesn’t seem like they care what currency the capital comes in. Or is the hypothesis that bitcoin is a redistribution of wealth, and the new holders won’t be interested in investing through traditional markets? If that’s the case, the economy might be pretty screwed too.;1;1;False;illiller;drbt0dg;Bitcoin is the real Occupy Wall Street.;7jytuc;https://twitter.com/JulianAssange/status/941600368588476416
"Of course, having a lot of Bitcoin enables you to do things which you can't if you have almost none. Take a trip to outer space, for example. (At least one of the Winkelvii booked a SpaceX flight with their Bitcoin. The other said he bought Legos. Whatever floats your boat.)

BUT even with crazy amounts of Bitcoin, things you still cannot do include (but are not limited to):

* Freeze or seize anyone else's Bitcoin
* Stop anyone from spending their Bitcoin
* Stop anyone from sending Bitcoin to a particular person or group
* Recind your transactions or anyone else's
* Create new Bitcoin and debase everyone else's Bitcoin, making it worth less
* Distribute new Bitcoin as you deem fit (i.e. Bailouts and payoffs)

All of which can currently be done in the Fiat system by the Financial Elite such as financial executives and governments. This results in a minority having great power over the majority. In Bitcoin they have no more power than the Average Joe in the street, albeit they may use that identical power to greater effect. Which is fair enough because there is no system in place which intrinsically prohibits the Average Joe from doing the same thing.";1;1;False;NewWorldViking;drbb2nr;Bitcoin is the real Occupy Wall Street.;7jytuc;https://twitter.com/JulianAssange/status/941600368588476416

"Bitcoin came about after banks gambled on a housing bubble. They lost so much money the banks were deemed ""too big to fail"". In other words, the money system was about to be exposed and collapse.

To prevent this it was decided the ordinary people of the world should pay to keep this bankers bubble unburst. And we're still paying for it.

Were we ever asked if we wanted to bail out the bankers gambling debts? No they made that decision for us.

But if you stored your wealth in Bitcoin they can't touch it. In fact as they print money to escape their gambling debts, it only encourages more people to buy Bitcoin...

Loans, financing, multi-party agreements, etc., will potentially be sorted out using smart contracts. These contracts are essentially code written to trigger a series of events when a given event on a blockchain occurs. And because it's all machine to machine it can all be automated. A loan is an easy piece of software that transfers some amount of cryptocurrecy to you, and it's recorded on a blockchain, and over a period of time the transactions go the other way, likely with a small % interest. I believe there are these types of loan services for various cryptocurrencies already available (e.g. https://www.trendhunter.com/trends/lending-platform).

"Not debating your first sentence, but Coinmarketcap isn’t necessarily “true value.” It takes an average of all the exchanges across the world and weights them by trade volume. A couple weeks ago, the Korean exchanges were sometimes over $2k above everyone else. At the same time, their trade volume was enormous. This inflated the price on Coinmarketcap to be even higher than the GDAX price for days, often by nearly $500. This would not have been “true value” for any westerner because it is extremely difficult to arbitrage money in and out of Korea and get those inflated prices. 

Even today, the Korean exchanges are trading at $19,500 USD, but their trade volumes aren’t as dominate as a couple weeks ago, so the spread between Coinmarketcap and GDAX is thin at the moment.

"You seems to be very knowledgeable in this area. Do you think I should buy 100 dollars worth and cash out when I double my money or hodl till I am a millionaire 

Also how do I sell my coins when I am rich do I just take the physical coins to the bank and get them exchanged for real money ?

When I do buy them do they send the coins to my mailbox? Also do I have to pay for shipping ?

So excited to retire early and quit my fucking job 


Thank in advance 

P.s sorry I know your probably busy won’t take much of your time

What kind of safe should I get to put my coins in ? I have a gun safe with a pin code and it’s fire proof and built in a wall behind a picture. I was thinking that would Keep it safe. I hear about people getting there wallets stolen. 

I had my wallet stolen once in the late 90s but I don’t normally carry coins in my wallet just usually in the front pocket of my jeans 

Why would people walk around with bit coins in there wallet. They are stupid. Now that I am thinking about it. Definitely keeping in my safe

"No, what it means is that bubbles are neutral. 

A bubble is when price strongly exceeds the asset's intrinsic value - meaning the value when you disregard market value. Your house intrinsic value is the value of the dirt it stands on, and the cost of the materials that make up your house. Location is not part of that value. So it is completely neutral. The housing bubble that we all probably remember came about when there were too many buildings for people to live in and not enough people to pay the loans to pay for those houses. A market correction was needed. 

A bubble is not going to hurt, but a bubble that bursts will hurt. So maybe you should just look at corrections. We see small corrections all the time. A bubble that bursts is just a big correction.

"Well not only Bitcoin, the whole industry is more ready and also the world itself. Some comparison. 

One big exchange, MtGox, which collapsed and brought the whole system down with it. Now there are hundereds. Cannot happen again. Also the wall street boys are joining with futures, etfs and etcs. Was impossible 2013.

A few altcoins back then. Now there are over 1500 with at least 20 that are really promising and proves what kind of stuff you can achieve with crypto and blockchains. Most live on the backbone of Bitcoin because that is the entry point and most trusted and oldest system. They need bitcoin wherever you like it or not. 

2013 it was drug money. Now it's accepted in most countries with regulations, ATMs, trusted companies etc.

Insanely more businesses accepting bitcoin today. Going very strong in Japan for exemple. Why use bitcoin if it cannot be used? Not true anymore. Things are developing fast now.

Big companies and Banks are developing blockchain solutions. That is very positive for Bitcoin because that is the underlying tech. People will trust it. 

Second layer solutions are soon here, lightning network for exemple. That will be a game changer. Was impossible 2013 because it was invented 2015. 

More open source developers and businesses are working world wide to solve the biggest questions. It's not even comparible to 2013. 

I could go on and on and on but it's getting silly. If you can't see this than you must have been under a big rock for the past years.

"Depends on the terminology you use (i.e. hype vs adoption). You could just as easily say that Bitcoin becomes more valuable as scarcity increases in relation to *n* holders. 

So you're right—BTC is only worth more because it is coveted. Much like gold, or other precious commodities (and yes, I'm aware gold has practical uses, but traditionally it has been a store of value moreso than a traditional material). Is it a bubble, or is the supply just incredibly limited in respect to the number of people accessing the currency? We'll have to find out.";13;3;False;jonodoesporn;drc005i;Well, that’s 18k!

"Sounds like how gold works in real life. People hype it up and make it seems valuable so the price goes up... Yet gold hasn't done anything to increase it's value. It's just a rock.

What happens when 10% of the worlds population start wanting bitcoin? 100x more valuable at that point.

"Not really.

Think about it.

There will always be people who think bitcoi  will be worth more. Therefore as the price falls of it falls there will be buyers to keep it up. They will increase the more it falls. This keeps the price from falling to zero in any short time frame.

Furthermore crypto has a permanent place in the world now. Therefore bitcoin will have permamnent place. It can never actually fall to zero. Proof: If tomorrow or ten years from now all of bitcoin had fallen so that you could buy all 21,000,000 million for $100 would you do it? Of course. Just on the chance it might go back ip. This of course would neve rhappe  becuade many mantly more people would make the same decision at much much higher prices.

The idea that bitcoin can go to zero is false.

Network effect assumes that bitcoin would actually be getting an increase in use cases. But 99% people (I pulled that number out of my ass but it wouldn't surprise me) just buy it to get rich and never use it for anything. It's definitely in a bubble right now (though I can easily imagine this being the actual correct valuation sometimes in the future, after it goes through a painful correction/bear market).

"Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram can generate cash flows by selling advertising space. While these may not be truly value-adding activities in the long run, at least there is fundamental rationale behind a valuation. Cryptocurrencies are instruments that few people fully understand or know what to do with. I agree that it's the technology that matters but what has happened to the technology that explains such a dramatic increase in value? An increase in the number users is inadequate, especially considering how many just buy and hold on exchanges. 

And sure, Bitcoin has been around for 8 years but it only broke $1000 this year, and since then it's climbed to nearly $19000?

"Pretty sure bitcoin is going up in value as the major country economies become increasingly unstable.  In the USA we have record bank corruption, record government corruption, record wealth disparity.  The establishment old money is holding on for dear life by rigging the laws in their favor as much as possible because they can’t compete otherwise.  Net neutrality is next; 86% of the USA population wants internet to be treated as a utility yet fcc still sells out.  It’s a fucking joke and everyone who’s been paying attention sees this.  The emperor has no clothes. 

.



Bitcoin it’s digital gold and gold increases in value as economies become more unstable.  Once the tipping point is reached I predict massive and unprecedented swings in wealth and power.

.



HODL because in the 3 year time window we all know bitcoin is the right play.  Does it really matter to freak out day to day at this thing or that thing?  This is all noise.  

.



Buy as much bitcoin as you can, go to fucking sleep... wake up in 2-3 years... and be wealthy

.



U want to make bitcoin or bitcoin cash take over the world faster?  Figure out a way to install a make-believe-bitcoin-credit-card on Apple Pay via jail broken iPhones.  Boom now we can pay for every day things at any store that is integrated with Apple Pay.  The revolution will not be televised.

You can look at all coin's total market cap increase and see the influx pour in over Oct, Nov and Dec.

"Right now, the ability to short Bitcoin is very limited. 
For those that don’t know what shorting is, it works something like this: 
The exchange or brokerage holds bitcoins. I borrow bitcoin from them and sell it to you at 18. I do this because I think the price will go down. The price goes down to 17. I buy it at 17 and return the borrowed coin and keep the difference.
If the price goes up, I still have to give back the coin I borrowed, so if it goes up to 22 and shows no sign of stopping, then I have to buy it at 22 and I loose 4.
Price moves up because of buying pressure. More people want to buy at the price than want to sell at that price. The price has to increase enough until it finds someone willing to sell at that price. 
That is why the price keeps rising. Everyone wants in now because the price is rising so fast and they don’t want to miss out on the riches.
This increases the amount of buyers and drives the prices up even more. That is where we are now with the added bonus of very limited money available for shorting ( remember that to take a short position you must SELL)
So, right now bitcoin is like a bottle of water in a sun parched desert. If you want to buy it, you will have to pay.
Another guy selling water comes along so now you can buy at a better price.
Three more guys come selling water so now water is cheaper.

So, when will the price of bitcoin go down?
When people start selling it. If you bought at 18 and the price goes down to 16, are you going to sell? What about 14?  Well, you and everyone else and that will drive price lower.

Remember, the shorts are salivating in the wings waiting for this thing to open up. Then, they are coming in and they are SELLING.

Nobody knows when or if this will happen, but it seems more likely than not. Don’t buy on margin.

that would be true if the futures were settled in bitcoin.  but these futures are cash settled.  basically you have someone who says bitcoin is going to go up.  and you have someone who thinks it will go down.  the futures manager helps get these people together and they make a bet.  in a month they settle up as if they had sold bitcoin at that price by giving cash in an amount according to what they value of bitcoin would have been if they owned it.  because they just pay the difference in cash no bitcoin is ever bought or sold.  therefore in the strictest sense these futures have no direct effect on the bitcoin market;1;0;False;duelistjp;drcjq75;Well, that’s 18k!

"That's like asking what a fair price for gold is. Obviously, it must cost more than its production cost. 1 troy ounce of gold must cost more than what it costs to extract it from the ground, refine it and assay it. 1 bitcoin must cost more than what it costs to mine it and secure the network.

The price of gold is somewhat influenced by the price of other metals. Theoretically, a troy ounce of gold could cost $1,000,000, but it would lead companies to use other metals with similar properties when they can and at $3215 per gram (the smallest practical amount), many investors would be priced out of the market.

Bitcoin doesn't have these limitations. The price has a lower limit, but the upper limit is anyone's guess. If you consider that 10% of the world population will ultimately use bitcoin and that the average user will store $1,000 in bitcoin, the fair price per bitcoin would be $50,000 with a supply of 15M bitcoins (current active supply). You might need to double or triple this price to account for powerful Wall Street-flavored investors.";1;1;False;Exotemporal;drceyha;Well, that’s 18k!

"It happens. Welcome to trading.

I’ve been really lucky. I bought $200 worth at 15.6k just to play with it. Got scared at 17k when it peaked and dipped and expected a correction or something and dumped half of it. Got lucky again and bought back at 16.5k a day or two later when the price was cycling.

I’ve read more into it now and am deciding if I want to just hold what I have and see where this goes, cash out half again at the next high and enjoy my very minor gains while still keeping some skin in the game or fully drink the koolaid of this going to the moon and drop another $300 or so on the next correction (if that happens) or just jump in and don’t look back. 

Edit: for the sake of clarity, I’ve been very skeptically and bearishly following the btc and eth market for over a year and just never could afford to get into and frankly expected them to not really go anywhere, but with the recent spike in popularity I decided to finally jump in and play instead of sitting on the sidelines. I sincerely regret not getting in sooner, but money is tight and I’m really risk averse so I would’ve panic sold and lost it anyway, so it’s probably better this way.

"You don't have to be near the bubble top for it to be a bubble. 


You are in a bubble as long as the price is above what it will stabilize at after a crash. Historically, Bitcoin has hit one significant digit more, and up to 1.1-3.0x that bubble-to-bubble. There is a high likelihood of a crash between now and 30k that could hit as low as 2k and stabilize around 4-5k.


That might not happen. Already I see less mania and panic crashes around minor issues. And this bubble is overdue vs previous trends set. So yes, past performance doesn't necessarily indicate future performance but - markets cycle in bubbles and for a growth market like Bitcoin, this is especially true. A bubble is not a bad thing. Just part of a normal cycle. 


Regardless, in order to say that this is not a bubble, you must make the claim that you do not expect to see a significant downward crash from the current price and that you expect stabilization around this price from now on. Historically speaking, that is foolish. You are either expecting Bitcoin to become stable at a high or you are expecting the $X0,000 bubble to be skipped in favour of the $X00,000 bubble.
