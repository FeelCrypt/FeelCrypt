"That's speculation.  Stimulus does not cause resources to appear out of thin air.  All stimulus does is take resources from productive people who have saved and prepared and transfers them to people who have proven adept at destroying capital.

"The land is rarely worth more than a fraction of any building. Buildings are very rarely made to last forever, particularly nowadays when quite precise calculations can be made to reduce the costs of production in order to fit a particular purpose. There are some buildings that will probably last 200 years or more, but there are also plenty of buildings that won't last 100 years, and some cheap stuff is already showing signs of going down the gutter after only 10 years. There are definitely lots of buildings that will fall apart and be deemed uninhabitable long before someone just wants to build ""something better"" in their place.";1;1;False;jarfil;dk0j4t6;What if the bank runs out of money;6m2btp;http://i.imgur.com/djrKAoW.jpg

"No. The point are awarded to the players for their actions much the same as money is awarded to people for their labor.

The source of the points is irrelevant as is the outcome of the game, whereas the outcome of our labour can be very important and thus the compensation should be commiserate and tangible.

Alright, I'm glad we agree! People just often use that argument to say that money is bad, so I felt the need to point it out.;2;0;False;thomasbomb45;dk03v6q;What if the bank runs out of money;6m2btp;http://i.imgur.com/djrKAoW.jpg
I don't think you are understanding. Property tax = value of land + value of building * millage rates. Property tax and building tax are not separate things, at least not here in the US. It is entirely possible to pass the cost of property taxes along to a tenant, by way of charging them more rent, in fact, many landlords do this. The rent is set by mortgage pmt + taxes + included utilities + % profit.;1;0;False;FlipFlopFanatic;dk09vjn;What if the bank runs out of money;6m2btp;http://i.imgur.com/djrKAoW.jpg
It's a good thing (for bitcoin users) because the way the federal reserve currently operates (inflation/printing unlimited money) is a flat out scam. Bitcoin is a way out and it's why btc will continue to appreciate in value for years to come. It's simple really. And it's not just a joke.. have you ever compared the color of the 1s, 5s, 10s, 20s, 50s and 100s in Monopoly money to the current colors of the USD bills? They are the exact same colors. The jokes on you buddy!

US government has people who will take damaged cash, examine them to figure out how much they were, and compensate you.  [This Planet Money segment](http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2017/06/30/535062249/episode-781-the-money-fixers) indicates you need to send in greater than 50% of each bill or convince the examiners that the rest of the bill was completely destroyed.

This isnt very well thought out. Enen if a building is condemned the land is still worth something. And when were talking about buildings, they can last forever. The only reason a building would be destroyed would be to build something better for that place at that moment.;3;1;False;centinel20;dk0dxwg;What if the bank runs out of money;6m2btp;http://i.imgur.com/djrKAoW.jpg
