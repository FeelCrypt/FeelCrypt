">I got into bitcoin in feb 2017. This was right before the hype train. “Back” then, there was hardly any reliable news on it and I did a lot of research. I didn’t know a single person that owned bitcoin and people thought I was nuts for buying in.

Meanwhile I remember everyone around me talking about bitcoin in 2013, I remember the post on this subreddit about the suicide hotline incase anyone was depressed after after the price dropped by over 80% and didn't just bounce back. If you bought in feb 2017 you're fine, if you bought before the hype you probably didn't pour your life saving's into it and even if you did a 90% drop and you're probably still in the green. Meanwhile there are people putting these on credit cards, tons of people with no money are putting their money into it. Thinking the price will still go up is a gamble and nothing else.

> If you think this is crazy, wait till next year.

I first heard about bitcoin when it was about $20, in under a year it was as $1200. I think you're the one that hasn't seen anything yet ;)

> It’s the most insanely liquid asset we have ever seen, ever.

What makes you say this? The technology or the price? 

Remember the ""panic"" where bitcoin's price retraced from $11k to 9k losing all the gains it made in what 2 days? Every exchange was having issues, the network unconfirmed transactions hit over 90k. In november we hit I think over 170k unconfirmed transactions. Bitcoin in its *current state* is **not** liquid. If a bitcoin billionaire ""retires"" and decides to start to liquidate billions and billions of dollars of his holdings so he can build schools in africa. It would kill Bitcoin. If Jeff Bezos did that with amazon stock there'd be no problem. There's a saying:

*Liquidity is always there until the moment you need it.*


> You’re reading too much into the tea leaves and driving yourself nuts.

I'm not reading anything, there are no leaves to look at. This entire thread is ""don't invest recklessly"" It sounds like you're not betting the farm on bitcoin by your entry date, but I have friends with barely any savings putting down $10k on dumb stuff like hash flare because their calculators said they'll make $100k by the end of 2018. They *might* or they might not. I know lots of people are taking out loans and credit cards to put it in bitcoin, I see my facebook and there are people putting a lot into bitcoin.

And you know, who knows I called my friend an idiot for putting $20k into bitcoin in 2013 when the price was like $200-300 (and that was -all- his money at the time). He's  a millionaire now. That could still happen for people betting it all today. I myself made a ton of money, more than my entire (sizable) retirement and taxable investments made in that time and I only put in like 2-3% of my money in.

>The one thing they never understand is that they would’ve had to have bought and hold throughout the years.

>This is that time and you’re busy mindfucking yourself.

I fully understand the lookback regret. In 2015 I almost bought another 25ish bitcoin then decided to scale back and only buy like 10. Hell in 2013 I almost bought like 10 bitcoin for like $500 before decided it'd be dumb. You gotta play the game to win it.

Once the general population start to buy, invest and spend bitcoin, that's when the hype will explode. That's probably 2 years away minimum. I predict steady gains til then, then an explosion.

The biggest issue that bitcoin has is the technical hoops that investors Are required to jump through to purchase coins - most people arent going to be able to do that.

"It seems you're mixing up two concepts, value and wealth. Apple had wealth, that was what I was describing if no one wanted stock anymore and it was liquidated this moment, what's left over is its ""wealth"". Its value is greater than its wealth but only about 3x as much.

Bitcoin however has no wealth, only value. Fiat has no wealth only value. Wealth is material goods, and the means of production. What a $1 bill is is a debt. When I have $1 the world owes me $1 worth of work. When I spend my time working and get paid $1 by my employer, that $1 is an I.O.U. The world now owes me back $1 worth of work.

When I buy food with that $1 I'm cashing in my I.O.U. Someone else takes that $1 as an I.O.U. to the next guy that they need something from.

Bitcoin is much the same, bitcoin is a token value of wealth, I can right now give you a bitcoin and you'll give me $11,000 worth of work.

Total inflows into bitcoin has been under $10billion, assuming that there are only 10 million bitcoin that aren't lost that means we currently have $100 billion in ""wealth"" that has been created out of thin air. Who did that much work? There are now $100billion in outstanding I.O.Us. It means if the price of bitcoin was ""real"" then out of nowhere a ton of work is owed to holders of Bitcoin.

Where did this debt of work come from?

> Do you know what gives money its value? It’s from participation. You get a group of people who believe something has value and BOOM, it has value.

If this was true, then why can't we all just create a ""human"" coin, evenly spread it out so everyone Human gets an equal share of human coins, then all collectively decide we each now have $1 trillion in wealth in the form of Human coins?

If we all believe it has that much value, would we not have just solved poverty, inequality, world hunger? If we all believe in the human coin and spread it out to everyone we'd all be rich.

> You seem like a smart guy who works in finance

I don't work in finance but I do read a ton about many subjects. I first put money into bitcoin in 2013 because I believed in its value as a transactional currency and its merits. I made a lot of money off bitcoin from a very small investment and I understand the technology very well. I think Bitcoin's main value is as a currency, however all this hype around it has made many get into a ""get rich quick"" mindset by most people ""investing"" into it. Bitcoin's worth is in its usability as a currency, and right now I doubt even $1billion in transaction occur in a year with bitcoin directly for goods. Yet it's taking over $1billion a year just to run the network. It's current price isn't a reflection of Bitcoin's utility, but a reflection of dollar signs in people's eyes. If Bitcoin's current value was closer to $2-4k I could believe the price reflects people's hopes and dreams of a future currency, but currently it's people's hopes and dreams that they can multiply their money. I would be surprised if even 10% of the inflows to bitcoin were from people who want to see it as a currency and not just trying to make some ""free money"".

I'm not trying to be negative I'm trying to be real. Bitcoin could still go up another 10x, 100x, who knows. But it's important to understand that currently the price of bitcoin is going up, because people want it to go up so they make more money. Meaning people in mass can never exit their positions because there's no underlying asset. Unless Bitcoin becomes a usable currency for everyday transactions, everyone cannot use up their Bitcoins at once without crashing the price, this gives bitcoin a pretty awful velocity of money which isn't good for a currency.";1;1;False;awoeoc;dqow4q1;Don't invest recklessly;7gi55s;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7gi55s/dont_invest_recklessly/

I think crypto does have a future but the value is in its applications not in expecting ever increasing token prices from get rich quick ICOs. I am not sure if the successful cryptos will end up having a fixed supply or will rather be pegged to something external in the real economy. I think fixed supply creates an artificial scarcity that tends to allow these speculative pricing bubbles such as we are currently in to form. Economically it should not be possible for you to buy a non-productive, non-equity asset and expect it to just increase in value over time. There is no economic function in the value appreciation of cryptocoins other than to arbitrarily redistribute wealth from late adopters to early adopters, kind of like a Ponzi scheme. I have not read up too much on ETH and I am not familiar with Cardano except that he was a Renaissance Italian Algebraist.

That’s exactly the benefits of these ideas going back and forth here. I agree with what u said, especially with token prices, like Ripple, for example. If Ripple gets too expensive, then customers will use another platform. Ethereum is still young but quite different in that regard. Ether and Cardano are building competitive platforms where, I believe a demand will exist for using these blockchains. I have a lot of faith in these. Also, no one is working on a music application for blockchain, so in interested in seeing how this turns out. These are the “power line” utilities being constructed for endless possibilities, including voting and p2p connections and transactions with malleable programming. This is why I like Cardano. They are learning from Ethereums mistakes and waiting for the technology before going balls deep. As far as Bitcoin, there will be a bubble. As crazy as this sounds, the real capital hasn’t even poured in yet, so I believe there is still time. That said, Litecoin is much cheaper, faster and much easier than using Death Star levels of electricity. But, what will the governments do? They will merge with each other, to an extent, and I believe they will slowly regulate crypto but not destroy it. Buying and selling limits for example and taxes through exchanges. They will eventually try to peg its price to something though, but who knows.

I look at the world and the future through the Ethereum lenses. Bitcoin is the tip of the iceberg. Digital trade is coming and there will be a massive reallocation of wealth and stability across the world over the next decade. Prices will have to stabilize globally, and that is a huge feat. I see Blockchain first, then I look at everything that will be built on this. I view it differently than you do, but I believe that the future will be decentralized and everything will be cloud based and that includes value also. Bitcoin may fail one day, but no time soon IMO. I am more excited about Ethereum and Cardano than bitcoin. The beauty of all of this is that the possibilities are endless and this is the free market competing to fill a new sector. I personally believe that most skeptics are wrong about crypto and that has been proven over and over. I’m 100% confident in my position and will never look back.

"It's great advice, and applies really to anything one can invest in. The truth is, as historic and huge this whole situation is, there is still a lot of shady stuff going on.


I was mining LTC a few years back and converting to BTC (as was the trend), at the time there were pools like LTC Rabbit, which I used to be on, and that just disappeared. There were exchanges, like Cryptsy, and look what happened there - a class action lawsuit is underway I believe to retrieve users funds - I lost a small amount, but couldn't imagine how upset I would've been if there was a lot in there.


I think this is probably one of the bigger problems now, the exchanges and the possibility of being exploited/hacked/swindled. It is true that this is also the case for other forms of investment, but other stockmarkets have been around a long time and there is some more safety in brick and mortar operations.

"You seem like a smart guy who works in finance but you’re connecting dots that shouldn’t be connected and also are not getting the idea of value.

The market IS assigning value to Apple by trading, it is actively figuring this out. The price swings up and down because there is CONSTANT speculation of the market value. IE - Apple announces tomorrow that it had 500 trillion in q4 earnings...well guess what, the market will go apeshit as it reassigns a more correct value to reflect this.

Your second fallacy, much like a lot of people within the space, is to compare bitcoins movement to that of a stock. This is not a stock.
It is not a company, so forget price earnings and all of that other nonsense.

Where did the wealth come from?

It came from people purchasing it on the open market, they are WILLING to pay said price for bitcoin. You can interpret it this however which way you please...but people are basically voting with their fiat to say that bitcoin is worth x amount.

Do you know what gives money its value? It’s from participation. You get a group of people who believe something has value and BOOM, it has value.

I sold all my Bitcoins this week. The explosion in volatility did not make risking my gains worth it to me. I am fortunate I got (not earned) what I did from investing early in this year. I always took it as a highly speculative investment. Yes indeed it is a quasi-religious mania / cargo cult. What in particular triggered my decision to sell now was reading about the uncertainty surrounding BitFinex and Tether. (See /r/tether) An exchange blowing up could easily pop the bubble. The risk was not worth it to me and I could not find a fundamental reason to justify the current valuation. There was recently an article in the NY Times about the uncertainty surround Tether and a BCH guy on the /r/btc claimed he contacted USA Financial Crimes Law enforcement on the issue. Even though Bitfinex / Tether are not based in the USA they need access to USD to function effectively. Their banking connections have been severed since the Spring. If they are receiving USD through informal channels that may be considered money laundering, etc. There is just too much uncertainty in that added to the fact that the current spot price of Bitcoin is entirely irrational considering of its lack of significant actual usage for things besides speculation.;2;2;False;BitGoyim;dqp1pua;Don't invest recklessly;7gi55s;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7gi55s/dont_invest_recklessly/

It's a consensus among people who don't know anything about bitcoin and see it as monopoly money, ignoring all of its revolutionary use cases. Bitcoin has been growing in value exponentially for 9 years and it's shocking for anyone used to much more reasonable fluctuations. The truth is that the price blew through $10,000 while only a fraction of a percent of the world population owns bitcoins. The price is probably going to keep growing purely for mechanical reasons as the awareness of bitcoin's existence and advantages keeps rising.;2;0;False;Exotemporal;dqppl4i;Dutch national newspaper urges people to sell all their Bitcoins as it undermines the government, could destabilise the economy and reduces the power of central banks.

It doesn't feel right because it wouldn't be right for any other asset to move like this, but keep in mind that bitcoin is in a class of its own and that the 9 years of continuous growth (minus a couple of blips) are a direct result of rising awareness about bitcoin's existence. The supply of new bitcoins is very limited while the demand is very high. The only real danger to the price is that a sizable percentage of users don't understand bitcoin and are here only for speculation, which introduces some fragility. The percentage of bitcoin users is still a minuscule fraction of the world population, so if awareness keeps rising, we can expect the price to keep growing exponentially before we can even entertain the idea of a stabilization. ;1;1;False;Exotemporal;dqpp7ez;Dutch national newspaper urges people to sell all their Bitcoins as it undermines the government, could destabilise the economy and reduces the power of central banks.

They never could be, they were just in control of the means for which your work was given financial value, whether labor or business.  I would be very scared of an internet coin that can turn my fake paper money into global money without a fee and can be exchanged without a government regulator taking a middle man fee.  What I don't think people understand more than anything about Bitcoin is it is destroying the very basis of the dollar's value by its own existence.  The point of the dollar for the people who print dollars is to beat inflation with fees that basically allow them to print money.  If banks can't make free money, there is no point in making more dollars, and the realization of that will cause a gigantic sweeping loss of confidence where the dollar is used, which is nearly everywhere.  The fact that bitcoin circumvents these fees is going to rapidly accelerate the collapse of the most speculative bubbles in major first world countries that have relied on central banking to hide their corrupt and toxic assets which will be exposed as having no value as they often get exposed eventually.;22;2;False;Herculix;dqpt9pa;Dutch national newspaper urges people to sell all their Bitcoins as it undermines the government, could destabilise the economy and reduces the power of central banks.

She specifically states a concern that investments in ICOs are high risk because they are not 'rated' investments and subject to regulations, like IPOs, which is hard to describe as anything else but cold truth.

Both for storing wealth that is hard to confiscate and possible to trade and for creating records and contracts that can not be altered.

"**Coingate scandal**

Coingate is a nickname for the Tom Noe investment scandal in Ohio revealed in early 2005 in part by Toledo, Ohio newspaper The Blade. The Ohio Bureau of Workers' Compensation (BWC) invested hundreds of millions of dollars in high risk or unconventional investment vehicles run by people closely connected to the Ohio Republican Party who had made large campaign contributions to many senior Republican party officials.

A rare coin investment fund has attracted particular scrutiny after it was reported that two coins worth more than $300,000 had been lost. Further investigation then revealed that coins worth $10–$12 million were missing and that only $13 million of the original $50 million invested could be accounted for.

You can buy any amount of Bitcoin you want.  You could set up regular weekly buys of $50 or $100, or any amount you choose.  Realistically though, with BTC fees getting fairly high these days (often $5-10 to transfer), you should understand it is becoming impractical to send/transfer amounts less than around $100.  The fee to transfer $50 would probably be about the same as to transfer $500 or $5000 since it does not depend on the amount of money but on the tx data.;3;0;False;sph44;dqprjqf;Dutch national newspaper urges people to sell all their Bitcoins as it undermines the government, could destabilise the economy and reduces the power of central banks.

"Essentially, the national debt shouldn't be seen as a measure of how deep in shit are we, like your regular credit card debt.

It should be seen as a measure of how much trust and potential people value the American economy and stability. 

Here's an example I always use: 

Say you have money you'd like to invest. There are 2 potential people who are open to taking investment money.

First one is Johnny. Fresh out of college, only 50 bucks in college debt, has a job at Starbucks making 5 a year, has 5 bucks in assets.

Second one is Mr. Brown. Investment banker for 20 years, currently holding 5,000 dollars of other people's money. His only job is investing that money. He's got a fancy car that is an asset of 100.

So Johnny is 40 bucks in the red, 50 - (5+5)

Whereas Mr. Brown has a 4900 debt, 5000 - 100

Who would you give your money to? Johnny, who judging from his significantly lower debt, should spend money better than Mr. Brown?

Not Johnny of course, the logic is simple.

Now let's add in the fact that if you funded Johnny, he'll make you 5 bucks a year, flat, because he can now afford to move to a bigger city and get a better job that pays 15 a year.

But if you funded Mr. Brown, he'll make your investment grow twice as much a year, only taking 10% of that as his fee. Also Mr. Brown has never, ever, lied. He always kept his promises. And he always pays on time.

Johnny is the other countries out there. 

Mr. Brown is the US. 

Everyone trusts the US economy. That debt doesn't mean China or American citizens and businesses can collectively force the US to bend its knees to any and all demands of the creditor right now. It doesn't mean the US is gasping for money. It means that 20 trillion dollar is waiting to be paid out, every single time they come up. And the US government expects to have made more in benefits of many forms than the initial value of the debt it took on by that time.

The article is not based on that blog post, it is literally just one of her arguments that is based on that blog post. The other (poorly written) arguments have no connection to that blog post whatsoever. 

>This article simply highlights the problems that could occur, which are very real, if Bitcoin does crash and does not recover from a bubble. They are valid threats and possibilities that should always be taken into account when dealing with funds.

Fair point.

"Central banks and fiscal policy is a good thing. They regulate how much people should borrow and invest, based on how the economy is doing. 

Creating new money creates inflation, but that's ok, if your nation's value increases to match it. You could, for example, have a perfect offset, where your nation gets more wealthy due to borrowing and investments, which increases the value of the dollar, and so they create new money to bring it perfectly to zero, and there would be no inflation whatsoever. 

But, instead we aim for a suitable amount of inflation, so that we can continue to invest and hopefully grow the economy. If that becomes dangerous, the central bank can change the interest rate to migitate lending, and creation of new money. So, inflation reduces, and the dollar will hopefully grow at that point.

Problems occur when a crash is too quick and severe. 

Bitcoin doesn't allow any of that, which is actually bad for countries.

"An interesting quote at the end of the article:

>  If I had one, I would sell it.

Lots of people writing articles in traditional media on how this HAS to go down for this and that reason. But none of these people can put their money where their mouth is *as they have no Bitcoins*. Traditional people now analyzing the scene for the first time, not quite grasping what Bitcoin at its core is so good at. The decentralized nature of it, the distributed and border-less nature of it, I dont have to go on, we all know these and many more. They might pressure other newcomers to not buy, but these don't pressure us hodlers to sell *at all*. Which means price will not come down crashing like they initially claim. Because they may call it energy-consuming, unbacked by a government or the best fucking money-laundering tool since taxes were brought onto this earth. If I ain't selling, and you ain't selling, and that other guy isn't either and those naysayers that dont own any, can't sell any. Well then we're just going to keep going.

Hoo boy. I know a couple of guys at my crypto trading server who've gone full neet. One dropped out of high school, another college last year. They thumb their noses at education. Let's just say both are showing signs of being on paths to becoming maladjusted members of society. When the trading bots start making life harder for amateur day traders, I truly do wonder where they'll be. No higher education degree, no trades/crafts experience, no soft skills. What then?

A one world government with a single cryptocurrency that's accepted worldwide is *probably* how the fundies are spinning things. From a political science perspective, they're probably not wrong that that's where we're headed.

"I don't see how that doesn't strengthen my argument.  We replaced gold with gold-backed paper money, then eventually with just paper money, in part *because* of the problems with hauling a million dollars of gold around.

Cash was a step forward from gold because it was easier to store and trade.  Bitcoin is yet another step forward, being even easier to store and trade in today's online world.

Gold has at least some intrinsic value as a useful material.  Bitcoin does not have that particular advantage.  It has value because everyone agrees it has value.  One of the things that will help ensure it retains that value is people being able to spend it.

I can go to the store and trade cash for food.  I can probably find a store that will take a gold bar as payment for food, but it will be harder.  Bitcoin is even harder to spend directly, but I hope that changes.  I don't want Bitcoin to replace gold.

"To your first point, using bitcoin and selling bitcoin is the same thing. I should have specified. Any trade is a sale/purchase, using bitcoin to buy something is a trade.

To answer your last questions about the consequences of people being able to invest in and use bitcoin to pay for goods and services: there will be little or no change for the US goverment or society as a whole.

The US government actively encourages ordinary people to invest in assets long term by having a lower tax rate for long term investments and by giving tax deductions to mortgages. Everyone is free to open an investment account or put their money into any variety of stocks and funds and pay no taxes on it until the day they realize the capital gains. If they put their money into large stocks or and an S&P500 passive index fund they can expect 7.5% yearly returns when factoring in inflation for the long term.

The government want the fiat currency to lose some of its purchasing power over time partly to encourage spending and investing in other asset classes. If there was deflation and usd appreciated compared to all other assets it would discourage spending and investing.

The government aims for around 2-3 percent inflation per year uses interest rates from the federal reserve to make it more expensive for banks to lend money, regulation on the reserve requirements in banks to force them to lend less and higher interests on their state bonds to remove money from the markets.

Bitcoin is an asset that you can trade with others over the internet without an intermediate, it is great for transactions between countries and perfect for developing countries.

Just a clarification, there is no set bitcoin tax, but bitcoin is taxed as property and property is currently taxed at 15%. This could change in the future and there may be differences based on your your district.

"You are right.

This is how I understand it, correct me if I am wrong.

If you earned no other income and realize a long term capital gains total capital gains of 50k that counts towards your income and you pay a 15% capital gains tax on everything above the 15% tax bracket.


15% taxes on 12349 in capital gain of the total 50k (50 000 - 37 651) and a total of 1852 (12349*0.15) in tax.

You only pay capital gains tax when you realize a gain.  If you buy and hold, and the value goes up, you don't pay taxes on it (yet), but when you eventually sell, even if it's years down the road, you would pay tax based on the total appreciation over your original cost.  Can you imagine if you had to pay CGT on your bitcoin gains this year (2017), and then the market were to plummet next year after you paid those taxes?

"The reason it is classified that way is for taxing purposes and based on how it is currently used.

Bitocoin is more similar to a stock or commodity and blockchain technology is more similar as an market than a currency.

Currencies is a unit that is used for trade in one and more countries and between countries. The value of the currency is relative to all other currencies and depends on the monetary policies of the countries that have them, trade between countries and the sort of markets that use it. Petroleum being traded in USD from countries that themselves do not use USD as a national currency for example.

When people want to buy a good that is valued at 10 usd they trade bitcoin that has a market value of 10 usd, then the vendor sell that bitcoin for 10 usd on the market and registers that they have completed a sale of 10 usd. You could say that the person trades the good for 10 usd worth of bitcoin.

I could write a contract that I will me transfer ownership of a fund or asset to another person in exchange for their car. Instead of me selling the asset and buying the car for the local currency I am realizing my capital gains trough a trade, I pay taxes on what I earned on the stock. People are doing the same when they are using bitcoin, they create a contract in the blockchain with another person that they will trade their ownership of X bitcoin for a good or service, then they register the difference they paid for the bitcoin and the market price for the good that they purchased compared to what they paid in usd to get the bitcoin.

If you are talking BTC, it’s my understanding that a well motivated investigator could trace all of the transactions, albeit with ample time and resources to do so. Certain privacy coins like Monero may make it much harder to impossible to trace. That being said, it is probably more unlikely than likely that the IRS is going to be able to trace all or any of your crypto activity. How would they know? They would likely have to be tipped in some way initially, either by subpoenaed account documents from Coinbase or another online exchange, a random audit that catches a suspicious financial transaction, a bank flag due to the size or origin of a financial deposit or withdrawal, etc. Like I said, these things are unlikely to happen, but can happen.

Does the IRS care, yes. Will it likely ever show up on their radar for such a small amount, doubtful. Does that excuse you from your legal responsibility to do what is right and pay taxes on capital gains, no. But remember that if you hold an investment for a term greater than 1 year and then sell, you only owe long term capital gains (15% capped) on the profit. If you buy at $20 and sell at $100, that’s $80 profit, of which you’ll owe $12 in taxes. Will the IRS come knocking on your door if you don’t pay this, almost certainly not, but why give them a reason to for such a small amount?;9;2;False;bpbenda;dqp2af4;I'm likely one of the Coinbase 14,000 that the IRS now has targeted.

Every time you exchange any crypto for anything else you have realized a capital gain (or loss).

If you bought bitcoin with an expectation of making a profit, rather than mere entertainment, and you have some documentation of money spent, you should have a good argument that this is some kind of capital loss or business expense rather than personal property lost. You need to research this though because it's not just yes or no answer. Depending on how you frame it,  you may get different answers for flexibility in timing, and whether its fully deductible.

"This entire thread is the perfect reason why BTC is not ready for prime time as a standard currency.  All the sovcit types trying to hide everything because 'taxation is theft' or some other such nonsense.  Build roads by using the blockchain as a decider as to where they go and have the local businesses pay for them?  What a complete clusterfuck of an idea that is.  'Why has there been a 388% increase in car accidents in the last 6 months?'  'Well maybe it is because we all voted to make Main St. shaped like a dickbutt just for the LOLs'  'Naw that couldn't be it, there has to be a better reason.'
  
Oooooo wait I know...we'll all stop using the internet to buy and store our coins.  Yeah.  We'll use Meetup to find other like minded and woke people to buy and sell coins that way.  I'm SURE that will work out just fine.  And we won't ever have to pay taxes again!  See you at the library!  Be sure to bring your Trezors!
  
We all live in the real world kids, like it or not.  The real world has governments, like it or not.  The real world government has taxes for a reason (and its not 'theft'), like it or not.  When you cash out your coins, you'll need to pay Capital Gains taxes, like it or not.  Now more than ever because of how well BTC is doing.  If it stayed down below $1,000 no one would give a shit about your Capital Gains.  But that's the rub, eh?  Get rich with BTC...pay your taxes.  Try and hide that shit...have fun.
  
And here's a helpful hint: if BTC ever DOES become a globally accepted currency that replaces fiat, do you actually think you won't need to pay taxes on it?  If so, I've got a great bridge to sell you for only 3.8 BTC...hit me up.

I kept pretty good records, but did do some initial shape shifting from a phone wallet just playing around so I have a few fuzzy spots in my book in regards to tracking alt>alt, etc.  Just seems like a logistical nightmare to track. I know my fiat in and fiat out, but apparently that isn't enough.  Luckily I hadn't traded much. I'll be sticking with ETH > Alt immediately for all alt purchases in the future, or realizing gains from BTC > Alt. 

I can only imagine what a nightmare some people's books are, if they've specifically tracked their large cap coins to alts to back, shapeshift, changelly,  Airdrops, GAS, etc.

"> If someone have been buying bitcoin since forever without selling it they are in the clear no matter what they have.

You mean buying bitcoin without **using** it keeps them in the clear. Cryptocurrency **use** is being taxed -- potentially a very effective way for the US government to control its adoption -- and it is this that fundamentally breaks analogies to stocks and other traditional investments. You don't **use** stocks as a medium of exchange. You don't **use** gold bullion as a medium of exchange. Cryptocurrencies are currencies, and like fiat currencies they are simultaneously investments and mediums of exchange. The fact that they are being taxed as property is essentially the US government saying, ""we don't want this to be used as money.""

The MMT school argues that taxes are what fundamentally give fiat currencies their value, and it is easy to see the logic in their position now that we have crypto. Crypto is beginning to offer a way of bypassing the use of national currency and it is conceivable that, uninhibited by legal obstructions, living entirely off of crypto will be doable someday relatively soon. But it is the fact that taxes are only payable in national currency that keeps the value of that national currency safe. *Because taxes are payable only in the national currency, and because you can still be taxed even if you fail to earn any national currency, you are forced to use the national currency to the extent that you engage in economic activity at all, consequently the national currency always has value.* This is the meaning of the idea that fiat currencies are ""backed"" by guns. Because you are being forced to use them on threat of imprisonment. Even if you do nothing but transact your life through barter or bitcoin, the US government will still force you to pay taxes which then forces you to use the US dollar because the government will not accept payment in barter/bitcoin. 

Taxation, it would appear, is what fundamentally guarantees that national currencies have value.

But it is more than that. The US government can always print more US dollars (i.e., borrow from the Fed), so actually taxes can really be conceptualized as a way of controlling inflation. That is to say, taxation is a way of removing money from the economy so that the government can print new money that pays for government programs without dramatically increasing the money supply. 

So if there were no Federal taxes, not only would the US dollar not need to be used and therefore rapidly lose value, but money printing would ruin its value even further. Put simply, Federal taxes are almost entirely about the US dollar.

Right now we are seeing a dramatic appreciation of all varieties of assets against the US dollar. In essence, hyperinflation has already begun, not for the consumer, but for the wealthy. But what happens when this dramatic appreciation of value next to the US dollar is in a new asset class that can itself be used as money? What happens when it isn't just the wealthy who park their excess liquidity in investments, but the average consumer can simultaneously remain liquid and invested at the same time? What happens when businesses have a means of accepting investment assests as payment? What happens when the only time anyone needs to hold US dollars is no longer for liquidity, but for taxes?

Who said anything about avoiding taxes?  OP said nothing of the sort, nor even implied it.  Your question reeks of prejudice.  You do not owe taxes for purchasing and holding bitcoins or other crypto-currencies.  The taxable event occurs when you sell it or trade it, and then you owe capital gains tax on the appreciated value over your cost.  If you hold for more than 1 year, you owe the reduced rate for long term holdings.  I'm confident most holders know they will owe capital gains taxes when they eventually sell.  I think OP's concern is that this will induce audits to tens of thousands of taxpayers who have been dutifully paying their income taxes and who understandably don't want the added hassle of an IRS audit simply because they invested in bitcoin a couple of years ago.;3;0;False;sph44;dqpc8pv;I'm likely one of the Coinbase 14,000 that the IRS now has targeted.

There is a wide variety of views. Some categorically dismiss any utility of taxes, other's are just fine with them.

They could, for example, instead rely more heavily on [land value tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_value_tax), which is impossible for a landowner to avoid because land can't pack up and move away.

Things to keep in mind: 

- Many households earn less then that.

- A tiny amount of super rich can skew this number upwards.

- In some cities in the US you need to earn a lot more simply to live which means they might not be able to spend on optional items. Think about someone earning 100k but living in San Francisco for example.

- How many earn more then that, but have no savings because of student or medical dept.

But some people seem to think that the very premise of paying taxes for money made in cryptocurrency is in question, which it isn’t. Buying cryptocurrency at one vale and selling it at a higher value is totally analogous to buying and selling stocks, and so should be taxed under capital gains.

"**Land value tax**

A land/location value tax (LVT), also called a site valuation tax, split rate tax, or site-value rating, is an ad valorem levy on the unimproved value of land. Unlike property taxes, it disregards the value of buildings, personal property and other improvements to real estate. Land value taxes are generally favored by economists as (unlike other taxes) it does not cause economic inefficiency, and it tends to reduce inequality.

Land value tax has been referred to as ""the perfect tax"" and the economic efficiency of a land value tax has been known since the eighteenth century.

"Yes. It really will depend on whether countries want to encourage or discourage the crypto economy. Ultimately, though, it is important for people to understand/appreciate that the concern really revolves around crypto-to-crypto trading where it is possible the tax laws can cause you to lose substantially more money than intended. Few people are really taking issue with the taxes that come from cashing out directly to USD. 

For another example: Say you are an ordinary Joe who makes 50K a year, but bought into bitcoin back in 2011 when it was next to nothing and now have 100 btc. Imagine that you trade all 100 btc for litecoin when bitcoin was $10,000 then trade back into bitcoin. Now you owe taxes on roughly $1,000,000. But imagine that before you have time to cash out 15% of your bitcoin to pay the taxes which your yearly income doesn't cover, the price of bitcoin crashes 90%. Now you owe more in taxes than you actually possess and will have to sell the entirely of your bitcoin just for a single lousy trade in which you probably didn't make much money anyway. 

These types of nightmare scenarios could be avoided if taxes applied *only* when one moved from crypto into USD.";3;1;False;Ilogy;dqpz568;I'm likely one of the Coinbase 14,000 that the IRS now has targeted.

This is not a case of the court merely applying equity brokerage law to the crypto world; they are overreaching that in ways that violate the privacy of many thousands of customers.

"> acquisition

This is a rather big stretch I think. Would it count if I've never even created a BCH wallet? If I happen to know there is value on the BCH chain that nobody in the world can control without the secret numbers that only (hopefully) I have, does that really mean I've acquired them? If someone stuffs an envelope full of cash into my mailbox, is it my property (my problem) at that instant or do I need to open the mailbox & envelope first? And then there's the folks who may be blissfully unaware (as I was about CLAM coin for a while). Treating them as negligent seems unfair, but taxing someone just because they knew about an alt chain seems silly too.

Do I also need to worry about all the other forks? I probably don't even know all of them (is Bitcoin Diamond a real thing yet?)

Strange to think about, because even importing the keys into a BCH wallet doesn't change anything real (I suppose an argument could be made as to intent here). I just don't see the justification for considering such a non-event as taxable (taxing proceeds of the sale of such coins assuming cost-basis 0 I can wrap my head around, though).";1;1;False;Quantris;dqpa8mi;I'm likely one of the Coinbase 14,000 that the IRS now has targeted.

"I’m treating my fork coins as a $0 cost basis. So if the coin is worth $100 and I sell it, I pay capital gains on the full $100. 

Some people are treating the value of the coin the day they received them as income, which you pay tax on. If you receive a $25 fork coin, you pay income tax on the $25. When you sell it for $100, you pay capital gains on the $75 difference. 

I’m not sure how to report your method on the IRS forms. It’s similar to when a stock splits into two different tickers like when GOOG split into GOOG and GOOGL, so there probably is a way. The only advantage your method has (which is admittedly a big one), is that you don’t have to hold the fork coins a full year to get long term capital gains. You only have to hold a year from which the underlying BTC was purchased. Other than that, it’s basically the same as the way I’m treating the forks.

Maybe I’m confused as to what you are trying to say. My original point was that there is IRS guidance for how digital currencies are interpreted by the IRS, and I have provided that link. There is no guidance suggesting that the IRS considers or will ever consider crypto to crypto transactions to be like-kind exchanges.

That is not how capital gains taxes work. If a CEO of a corporation is given a stock worth $100 today, they owe regular income taxes on $100 even if they do not sell the stock. If they hold the stock for a year and sell it for say $150, they will have paid tax at their ordinary rate on $100 in year line and capital gains taxes on the $50 capital gain in year two. If you eliminated capital gains taxes the CEO in your example would still pay the ordinary income tax on the $100. Getting paid in stock instead of cash does not change the taxable nature of the payment. ;5;0;False;;dqp98w0;I'm likely one of the Coinbase 14,000 that the IRS now has targeted.

Also, it’s moving USD where they get you, not moving BTC. They will know where your USD came from and where it went if they have information from the exchange.

So you disagree with capital gains taxes entirely? You realize most CEOs and board members of large corporations get paid in stocks so that they only have to pay capital gains instead of the regular income tax, right? If you got rid of capital gains taxes then most rich people would pay literally nothing in taxes. That’s why there is a lower limit to capital gains, you have to have made over a certain threshold before it starts getting taxed. That is precisely to protect normal everyday investors who are using capital gains to supplement their income, not replace it. So you either need to be OK letting the rich get away with paying nothing, or suck it up and _maybe_ pay a _fraction_ of your capital gains to the government.;7;2;False;Fakjbf;dqp8yfj;I'm likely one of the Coinbase 14,000 that the IRS now has targeted.

"At least with currency, you separate out the part of the increase in value that came from the currency and pay tax on that on separate forms than the part that you pay for the ""other thing you acquired"". 

In other words, in my $5.01 example if you spent $5.01 on an item, you would actually pay taxes on the 1 cent specifically declared as ""increase of value of currency"".  Then if your European purchase was in Hungary, then you would owe Hungary VAT tax (27%) on the entire purchase so you would then pay Hungary about 14 cents in VAT tax.  Note: ""VAT"" stands for Value Added Tax so I know saying ""VAT tax"" is silly: Value Added Tax Tax.  :-)

"Da fuq? SS is absolutely horrible my man. They blow the money you put in now on other shit with the intention to pay you with future revenue, it is quite literally a textbook example of a ponzi scheme. SS is no where near sustainable and is heading full speed ahead to insolvency.  As it stands now, many of us will wind up paying into it our entire lives and likely only receive a tiny fraction when retire - if we get anything at all.

A much better system would be to save and invest your contributions over the course of your career instead of blowing it on consumption like the government does. If you were able to save those contributions, you'd probably have enough accumulated wealth by the time you retire that you could live comfortably on just the interest, leaving a nice pile of change for your children.  This is called capital accumulation and is how you get rich in a capitalist society - SS makes this nearly impossible for your average working stiff.

Instead you are effectively giving them a free loan to go bomb brown people or whatever they squander our wealth on.

Then point is SS is a huge scam that appeals to the emotions of the economically illiterate (ie the majority of Americans since US schools rarely teach any economics, and when they do it's usually horribly biased).  It may seem nice to have the short term benefits of SS, but the long term costs have made us all unfathomably poorer and, worst of all, has caused large swaths of the population to become financially dependent on the government.

And don't get me started on roads and schools. These are two massive money sinks with consistently piss poor results.

"Re-read my comment. I listed those as classic examples of public goods.

But there's variation in how hard it is to imagine each of those classically public goods as private goods.

* A justice system: ancap / libertarian types like to talk about ""polycentric law systems"", and imagine ""dispute resolution organizations"" that people could voluntarily opt into. Personally I don't think this would be stable (I think it would disproportionate into some number of sovereign territories, just like the countries we have now), but it is imaginable.
* Roads can be built privately. Some already are - toll roads (dramatic, but not quite purely private), and farm roads are examples. It's possible to exclude non-paying users: you simply don't lift the gate for them.
* Military defence: imaginable as insurance industry coalitions. Insurance companies would insure your business against foreign invasion, and then they'd invest in tanks and jets to reduce the risk of that happening. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP4f68Va9kA
* Telecommunications: you could have fiber optic networks spanning the country and let only paying users access them. Almost like... today!

"**Public good**

In economics, a public good is a good that is both non-excludable and non-rivalrous in that individuals cannot be effectively excluded from use and where use by one individual does not reduce availability to others.

Gravelle and Rees: ""The defining characteristic of a public good is that consumption of it by one individual does not actually or potentially reduce the amount available to be consumed by another individual."" In a non-economic sense, the term is often used to describe something that is useful for the public generally, such as education and infrastructure, although these are not ""public goods"" in the economic sense. This is in contrast to a common good which is non-excludable but is rivalrous to a certain degree.

Public goods include fresh air, knowledge, official statistics, national security, common language(s), flood control systems, lighthouses, street lighting, and Wikipedia itself.

That's a very imperfect ""perfect solution"". Joe wants the road to cut through Bob's land, and Bob wants the road to cut through Joe's land. If Bob has more money than Joe, maybe he can get the road to cut through Joe's land, but then we've injured Joe - *forced* him to accept the road cutting his land into two pieces. That isn't qualitatively better than the system we have now in most jurisdictions: Eminent Domain type laws that allow the state to just decide and (usually) compensate the ""losing"" landowner for their loss.

Of course there is.  They explicitly exclude those classes of property exchange which do not qualify for like-kind treatment.  Crypto isn't on that list.

Crypto was never put on that list, even when they ruled that crypto was property back in 2014.

"Profit from capital gain is income as is receiving money for working in someone else's enterprise. 

Why would you tax one (which is the only source of income for the vast majority of people) and not the other (which is only an important source of income for the richest among us).



I have no idea how you've come up with all those other questions. You seem to be ignorant of the basics of human societies in general and democratic decision making in particular.


There are different models, but if you live in the US or the EU, you have democratic elections of legislative bodies, which may elect the head of government.
In some countries the head of government is the president and is elected directly.
The candidates present their programs and the most popular ones get elected. The winners of the election compile from their programs a set of measures as a government program.

It's a compromise between the different interests and needs of the population. These programs need to be financed. Financing is mostly done via taxes and partly via debt.
How taxation is distributed across different parts of the population and the economy is decided by the elected legislative and government who represent the polulation who.elected them.

Fairness is definitely a factor when deciding who and what to tax and how much. Taxation is therefore a very complex system of laws regulating rates, exemptions, procedures etc. which are subject to frequent changes and take up a large chunk of each government's work.


I hope this gives you a vague idea. Yet should you live in a democratic country and are older than 14, I am shocked by your ignorance and would strongly advise you to start reading some quality news papers and watching the news.
Rereading your school books might help as well. Some of them definitely contain all the info necessary to answer your questions.";0;0;False;rockybeethoven;dqpjbv9;I'm likely one of the Coinbase 14,000 that the IRS now has targeted.

This is for simply failed to file or failed to report. This is the standard ""oops, I forgot about that"" which is probably the situation of most crypto holders.

The IRS wants its money more than anything so obviously they're not going to come down on your door to arrest you because you failed to report BTC gains. They'll just ask for their money down the line plus interest and back taxes, pay it? You're good. Tax evasion is when they catch you actively trying to not pay your taxes.

Two questions, two answers. It’s your responsibility as a tax payer to report any and all income. Ignorance of the law is not a valid defense. Like speeding, it doesn’t matter if you don’t know what the speed limit is or if there wasn’t a sign. A judge may decide to throw your case out, but you are still breaking the law. Secondly, no, there is no way to know what the IRS does and doesn’t have on you. For the most part, they aren’t collecting boxes of information on you. For most people, if you get flagged for an audit they will investigate to a certain extent matters related to the nature of the audit, but it is just too impossible for them to be actively and deeply collecting mountains of information on hundreds of millions of tax payers.;16;1;False;bpbenda;dqozje5;I'm likely one of the Coinbase 14,000 that the IRS now has targeted.

I am not a tax professional and therefore cannot answer that specific question for you. What I can tell you is that stocks, bonds, notes and other assets considered to be securities do not qualify as like-kind exchanges in the eyes of the IRS.

"you cant just go up to a bunch of black people and go most of you are gangbangers, so we're gonna arrest all of you.   Just start auditing bitcoin users on an individual basis.  Until there's proof of wrongdoing the government has to assume that you're one of the 800 - innocent, until proven guilty.

We have a tax system in place that drains 2 tril a year out of our economy.  It works and its onerous as hell.  I've been working on my taxes all day today.  Trust me - we're not mexico.  None of these small potatoes, mostly geeks college kids are not gonna get away with much.
The mafia wasnt trading on coinbase in 2015.  It's not some national crisis where we should throw out the laws because its a national emergency. bitcoins were like 100$ back then.  Alot probably were under 20k.

I mean we preach freedom and rule of law here but soon as something new or scary happens we instantly throw away our principles and role out the gestapo tactics.  They're singling out a group of people - bitcoin users and applying unique laws to them, and yeah financial privacy is important.  what if we just started looking at all of the bank accounts of gays.. or journalists.. would that not be oppression?

If you were to listen to the media you'd think we're all in ISIS or something.. read this reddit.. what's the vibe you're getting here?    We're geeks.. we're smart.. and now we're all rich.  And bitcoin wallets are going to be set up in congress.. and you'll see the tide turn very soon.

Social security was lumped in with the general budget back in the 1960s under Lyndon Johnson's administration.  It might appear as a separate line on your paycheck when you see your taxes taken out, but it is part of the general budget.  Now that the baby-boom generation is retiring, every year less and less of the benefits paid out (federal expenditures) come from current contributions, and this is getting worse due to the aging of the population.

"> Its a currency, not a stock.

That really doesn't matter.  If you buy Euros at 8am for $5, and sell the Euros at 9am the same day for $5.01, you owe tax on 1 cent in profits you made from making these trades.

I agree Bitcoin is not a stock, but it seems more like a ""collectible"" like a baseball card than a currency.  Increase in value of collectibles are taxed as a capital gain.

But it really doesn't matter what I think: I live in the the USA, and pay 100% of the taxes that the USA government says I should pay.  They decide some semi-arbitrary rates of sales tax, capital gains tax, income tax, property tax, etc.  Then they classify all sorts of things for me into each category.  Then I follow their rules to avoid jail time for tax evasion.  And the USA government has absolutely positively ruled on Bitcoin.  You can read about it in Forbes: [https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2017/02/21/if-you-traded-bitcoin-you-should-report-capital-gains-to-the-irs/](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2017/02/21/if-you-traded-bitcoin-you-should-report-capital-gains-to-the-irs/#23cc91f1e3d8)

TL;DR - The IRS classifies Bitcoin an ""intangible asset"" - report it as capital gains.

Edit: if you don't live in the USA, you will need to consult your government's laws!!  For example, if you live in Monaco, they have no income tax.  So each government decides their own arbitrary rules of how they plan on collecting money from their citizens, and (most of us) follow the arbitrary rules.

"the issue is crypto presented a way to make money without the IRS having visibilty as to how much you made.  The IRS found only 800 tax returns had coins in them which is less than the 14,000 accounts that coinbase said had bought and sold Bitcoin.

Hence, the IRS went to Coinbase and asked for all your detailed info including your darknet purchases, (ha got ya. just joking) of US based Coinbase customers. To which CB said no. 

Not to be denied, the IRS went to court and won. Coinbase has to provide the info on annual transactions over $20,000 for each year from 2013 - 2015.

You can amend your last 3 years worth of returns to correct errors. If you haven't reported gains it's not too late. If you haven't reported losses then the IRS probably won't come tell you about it but it would be in your best interest to report the losses as they can offset your other capital gains or ordinary income, like wages, to a small extent. Go see a local CPA or enrolled agent. It's honestly not that complicated to report as long as there isn't a ton of transactions. To add to that, a lot of people wouldn't owe tax on it anyway as your capital gain rate is 0% until your taxable income is in the 25% tax bracket which is about 70,000 for married filing jointly.

"Btw, **Taxation is theft**.  (same as you should be able to just buy own food, instead central gov taking everyone additional 1% of income and buying everyone ""free"" oatmeal that you hate).

(yees roads too and shit, guys investors exist and build even larger **private funded** projects, you buy entire cinema complexes, shopping malls and other private things just by then buying in them daily stuff - sad /r/bitcoin become so mainstream that this needs to be explained to supposedly **cypherpunks**/**ancaps**/**self-independent** people. Yes central army, and very few other things might need to be centrally paid - but that is like 2% of country budget, easily covered by opt-in land tax, instead of **spying on each citizen, questioning what is income and what is profit and then punishing for being profitable**).

So if you made a lot, why not take the route that some millionaires make and just move to other country?

* kingdom of Monako (located near France/Italy) has 0% income tax (need around 1 million $ to become citizen)

* there are few other high quality (not ""wild"") countries that have that. Bermuda. Hong-Kong and Singapore practically have no tax. Many other countries make it really easy to pay no income tax (which is a theft) if you set up company properly (get pro accountant for that),  and then you just pay an opt-in (so not theft) tax like for buying land to build your company/home on.

* many of ""wild"" countries are not as bad as they paint it, no not just Somalia ;)

* there are dozens of 1st world countries ""just like USA"" that still do the theft but at least are less hostile against citizens when stealing tax, e.g. do not hunt them all around the world so aggressively

If bitcoin would go to 100,000$ or 1,000,000$ and (many of us) would be multi-millionares that easily can buy house and travel weekly in/to another country, would you then?

"So Bitcoin is a currency. At least is officially accepted by Japan and adoption there grows rapidly. I’ve also seen in UK some places where you can directly buy with bitcoins. I would expect the same principles to apply as for foreign currency taxation.

"The big deal is that crypto to crypto trades are often/usually not about increasing your USD holdings, but rather increasing your bitcoin. So, for example, if one sees Ethereum is rising next to BTC, one might buy Ether and then sell back into BTC. 

The problem is that the taxes are in USD. So just the act of buying ether might cause you more losses in bitcoin due to taxes than you gain through the trade. This never happens with regard to the USD because taxes are always only a portion of your net USD gains. But in trades where you aren't concerned about realizing USD gains, but rather increasing your bitcoin, the tax laws can actually hurt you . . . substantially.  

For example: Let's say you bought 30 btc when they were at $200. You trade all thirty bitcoin for ether at 0.036 btc and sell the ether at 0.0396 btc for a gain of three bitcoin. At no point were you interested in USD. However, say the price of bitcoin at the time of the trade was $8000. You now owe capital gains on your bitcoin (having bought at $200 and sold at $8,000) which comes to roughly $35,000 or 4.3875 btc. You've actually lost 1.3875 bitcoin on the trade. If in 3 years that 1.3875 bitcoin comes to be worth $80,000, you've lost a great deal, none of which you can claim as losses on your taxes.

These tax laws dramatically discourage crypto to crypto trading for precisely this reason, which is bad for the crypto economy.

"I don’t understand why everyone has their parties in a bunch about this. The IRS is just doing their job. It’s called information matching. When you file your taxes, they check what you put on your return against some forms that were filed by banks (for dividends, interest, cap gains, etc) to see if the numbers on your return match what the bank/broker filed. It’s a simple way for them to figure out if someone filed incorrectly.

This still seems so ambiguous to me.  Does that mean $20K in USD value at the time of the transaction(s), and more importantly, does that mean $20K per transaction at any time (ie. 1 transaction for that amount or higher triggering the release for probable audit), or does that mean $20K in accumulated value?  If it is in accumulated value over 3 years (I read it was 2013-2015 thus 3 years), then that's not even a substantial amount of money for many who have invested steadily over 3 years, so that would be hugely different than a single > $20K transaction triggering it.

A lot of people didn't sell any bitcoin (and thus didn't make any income from it yet), just bought it and sent it to their own wallet.

"I'd be interested to know how much it costs the IRS to collect tax on bitcoin. A Freedom of Information request may reveal that, if that is possible?

Simplistic example: for $1 collected, it might cost the IRS .6c. (probably more, because seigniorage on a dollar bill is .5c alone)

This cost (of collecting bitcoin chargeable gains) I assume will increase with adoption, because they will theoretically be chasing more people around the block.

At which point does it then become economically unviable to collect tax on bitcoin? There is an opportunity cost to seigniorage to consider in this: conceivably the government would consider reforming the IRS, as they may as well spend that .6c on bitcoin themselves instead of on the cost of collecting tax on it.

Especially as chargeable gains will only occur in the event of bitcoin rising

Congrats on your success, however to be honest, this post is a little ridiculous.  Of course the IRS would track investment transactions with mutual funds.  I am not sure why people are making this such a big deal, have you never invested in the stock market?  I have since I was in college and every year I include my trade activity while reporting my income to the IRS, crypto is no different.  This is not some plot to screw the crypto community, this is the law for all investment income... now if you have not made any trades this year, then there is no taxable transaction so you have nothing to worry about.  However when ever you do sell btc, you will need to pay your taxes on gains, just like any other asset you invest in, including mutual funds.  Not sure there any need for legal representation in this processes, I am a CPA and honestly the tax law for crypto is pretty straight forward, find a CPA who understands it and you will have no worries going forward.

For what it's worth I didn't get the sense that you were considering tax evasion at all. 

I find this whole thing to be frustrating as hell and would prefer that financial institutions and governments keep their corrupt hands out of crypto currency.

"I think they are looking for people who used $20K of BitCoin to pay for something (AKA sold it). BitCoin is not a currency based on the US tax code - it's property so it's treated like an investment. 

Because of this, when you buy something with BTC it's technically 2 transactions - you are selling your BTC then using the proceeds to buy whatever you bought.  So if you bought BTC for $500 and sold for $20,000, you need to pay capital gains taxes on the $19,500 investment income you made.  If you held it for over a year you pay the 15% capital gains tax or $2,950.  If you held it for less than a year you pay whatever your tax bracket is which could be as high as 39%.  What the IRS is doing is looking for people who liquidated over $20K in BTC.  With the ledger they would know what they paid for it so they could then make them pay the capital gains tax on it. 

Most mutual funds already report that info and issue you a 1099 which facilitates paying those taxes so that's probably what will happen with BTC if it remains classified as property.";7;0;False;CoopThereItIs;dqpgbg3;I'm likely one of the Coinbase 14,000 that the IRS now has targeted.

That's my question too.  There is an enormous difference.  You could have bought and sold a few bitcoins in 2013 and it would only have been hundreds of dollars, nothing important.  But if they were to use today's value it would seem like a lot of money.  More importantly, is it per transaction, or accumulated value of transactions?  If it is based on the value at the time and it's 20K per single transaction, then that would cover relatively few people, but if it's based on all transactions combined it would probably cover most people who believed in Bitcoin and began investing early.;1;1;False;sph44;dqpbttc;I'm likely one of the Coinbase 14,000 that the IRS now has targeted.

"You're not being targeted because of crypto. If you had traded 20k in stocks on ameritrade that shit would've been CCed to the IRS, if you had bought 20kin ETFs and then sold it. It would've been sent to the IRS as well. When you get paid, it gets sent to the IRS..
You're only hearing about it in crypto because it's new. But it's the same exact shit as any other investment avenue out there.

Where is the ""overreaching""?

The only difference is that when you do ameritrade, bank, forex, nymex trading, those platforms report automatically so the IRS matches everything with your report automatically.  That doesn't exist for crypto yet. So they need to literally ask for X papers to coinbase to do the same thing.

They get the number and your gains and your name put it in the system and that's it. It will match with the rest of your Financials. If you trigger any red flags, ie you made 600k but reported 300k, you get audited.

The guidance on cryptocurrency that has been established by the IRS is that a sale from one coin to another, like VTC to BTC or any coin to another coin, is considered a taxable event. That being said, it is still a legal grey area. It is unclear what the IRS can and will know about any one person’s cryptocurrency transactions. So, if you choose to not report (because you don’t think the IRS will find out or for any other reason), you run the risk of tax evasion. That is a decision that you have to make for yourself.

"I am not a tax advisor and have no specific information about US tax rules. Hire a professional to help you!

In some tax systems you can carry forward the loss created by the stock sale into the future and use it to reduce taxable gains.

Example(way way way over simplified):



Year 0: Buy stocks for 10k

Year 4: Sell stocks for 5k (declare 5k loss on your tax report). Buy 5k Bitcoin

Year 5-10: Don't do anything. Carry the loss forward (It stays in the system)

Year 11: Sell Bitcoin for 10k. The 5k profit can (if legal) be added to the 5k loss from year 4 so your total taxable gains are 0 and your tax is 0 as well.";3;1;False;A_scientific_dolphin;dqp4kbd;I'm likely one of the Coinbase 14,000 that the IRS now has targeted.
