Firstworld problem...  I wish someone would create a site which organizes all of the bitcoin comics on the internet and have them organized by popularity, date, etc...  I would enjoy such a site. I'd attempt to create it myself but I have so many other priorities at the current time it would never be realized.   Maybe someone, someday, who is toying with web frameworks  looking for a project will take this as a challenge and create one. ;2;0;False;Mknox1982;ch286g9;We've gotta be able to laugh at ourselves;1z5ynn;http://explosm.net/db/files/Comics/Rob/givemeyourcash.png
