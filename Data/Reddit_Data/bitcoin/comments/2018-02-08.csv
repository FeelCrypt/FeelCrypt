I'm still not sure what you really meant by that statement. It sounds like a very emotion driven statement.

"This isn't bad advice investing in an associates degree or certifications is a great investment because certs can double your salary and associates can get you jobs you wouldn't be able to before (not to mention the first 2 years of college, the associates degree, has just as much to do with teaching you how to be a functioning member of society, how to network, speak to people, etc.)  Obviously if you enjoy school (or at least do well) it's even better to turn that associates into a Bachelors.

The stock market has been doing it's job for over 200 years.  As long as there's companies who make money and issue stocks, there's growth to be found and all that growth gets rolled into more shares next year which compounds and compounds.  [Even Benjamin Franklin spoke praises of how powerful compound interest is.](http://www.mymoneyblog.com/ben-franklin-compound-interest.html).  That model isn't going anywhere.  It's one of the coolest things about being a human that can live for so long, you get to witness investments compound and grow to enormous sums of money assuming you're intelligent enough to get involved and stay involved from a young age.  I think most intelligent people recognize crypto as another potential means of making money, but very few cryptos pay dividents that can be rolled into more coins automatically so it doesn't have the long term snowball power of the stock market.   No one would deny the stock markets insane track record for allowing normal people to retire with a shitload more than they put in.;4;1;False;spaceshipguitar;dty3dgn;Millennials Love Bitcoin And Hate Stocks;7w4731;https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2018/02/millennials-love-bitcoin-and-hate-stocks/

That's interesting but what worries me is how fast the tech is changing and evolving.   Many of the coins you been investing in could easily be obsoleted by better tech in 5-10 years and meanwhile, with a standard Roth IRA, you spread it among a hundred giant companies and they keep going for centuries.  Because a company can change to the tech, but many blockchains infrastructure is set in stone and / or takes too long to successfully port to something different before a competitor takes all the cheese.  So you could easily be plugging 22 grand into it for 4 years and all of a sudden it drops to zero because a new wave of tech outperformed the original coins by a factor of 100.  Roth IRA picks should be something that isn't going anywhere, crypto is too new and moves and changes too fast to be picking definite 30 year picks.;2;2;False;spaceshipguitar;dty89wi;Millennials Love Bitcoin And Hate Stocks;7w4731;https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2018/02/millennials-love-bitcoin-and-hate-stocks/

Thing is, stocks, especially niche stocks are a bit harder to find and research, and as such, conversation for them isnt as easy amongst our generation as crypto.

"Does Cannabis end with recreational marijuana? 

People are COMPLETELY forgetting how big cannabis was before it was criminalized. Not speaking as a hippie, but cannabis has the potential to replace opioids when it comes to pain management. Marijuana goes from smoking a spliff with your friends to helping a woman with menstrual cramps, to helping a cancer patient deal with nausea and loss of appetite. Then there are SO many different ways to consume it as well. Smoking, vaping, oils, edibles,

But wait, what about its other uses besides medicinal and recreations? Industrial hemp. Hemp can be to create fibres, food, construction(check hempcrete), fuel, pet food. All of this has low THC and is not intended to get you high. 

HempCo Canada (HEMP) a Canadian publicly traded company that makes Hemp foodstuff, their [protein powder](http://hempcocanada.com/product/hemp-protein-powder/) per 100 grams contains roughly 50 grams of protein, a boneless skinless chicken breast contains  [100 grams](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/protein-in-chicken#section1)

TL;DR So with cannabis you get clothing, housing, food, medicine and also be use recreationally. There is no way this industry is going to be a behemouth in the next 5 years, it will take time for it to grow. But the number of countries lifting restrictions on it is definitely a positive sign and shows there is good opportunity in this industry.";1;1;False;bennyllama;dtya1la;Millennials Love Bitcoin And Hate Stocks;7w4731;https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2018/02/millennials-love-bitcoin-and-hate-stocks/

"/r/RobinHood for non-commission trading

Though, you have to pay extra for day trading (buying/selling the same stock more than once in a day I think).

However, to me, it's sort of a weird tool because most people who are knowledgeable enough to make a substantial profit day trading are using more advanced brokerage tools for short-term gains, and for long-term investing there are much less volatile routes one can choose. 

Personally, I think it's fun for penny stocks or putting a bit of money down on volatility indexes if things turn upside down but this is essentially the same as walking into a casino expecting to lose *n* amount of money and having either a good or bad day. Same could be said for crypto I guess but it's much more user-friendly.

"I agree with what you have said above but it’s important not to mix criticism of crypto and the traditional stock market to excuse one with the other. 

We must look at both objectively. In this case we were discussing the stock markets growth behaviour and future potential. 

My point being that just because the stock market has existed and thrived through the industrial revolution and North America’s rise because of the devastation caused in Europe during WW2 does not mean it can continue this pattern of perpetual and exponential growth. 

Warning signs being that central banks are now stepping in to save this system by propping up stock markets with money they created and lowering interest rates to almost 0. 

These are really the only 2 tricks they have to play with. 

My understanding is that central banks having to prop up stock markets is a very new development.

These are also functionally securities (at least in the US) that will eventually be subject to securities laws, although we all hope that evolves (since I consider the accredited investor rules to be excessively paternalistic).

"Crypto hasn't even had a chance to fork/develop into ""historically safe"" and ""aggressive"" currency yet. That being said, let's say that ""historically safe"" is bitcoin and ""aggressive"" is ethereum and litecoin for the sake of argument. You saw what happened a few days ago. People who were putting all of their faith into bitcoin also lost a lot of money because of the crash followed by a panic sell. You're comparing an infant technology to the stock market which has been around for decades. Give crypto time to grow and eventually capitalism will snake it's way into it and the same kind of shit will occur. For example, an entire nation could release a news statement saying they're banning crypto, wait for the price to plummet, secretly buy up a ton of it, and then recant their original statement. What's stopping this from happening today? In fact, I can bet you that shit like this is already happening as we speak. Like it or not, the little guy is being fucked over regardless of what he/she invests in.

And if crypto ends tomorrow or slowly dies over the next 5 years, people WILL be affected. There are people out there who've taken out mortgages to go all in for bitcoin. There are others who are using bitcoin as a retirement investment. The world WILL be affected if bitcoin crashes. Not as much as 2008 but there will definitely be a TON of people affected.

See, what you have here is a generation of young investors who are finally feeling empowered that they have some say in what they're investing their future in, which is great. But at the same time, that empowerment can be taken too far and someone might start saying that crypto rocks, everything else sucks. Empirically, that's a terrible attitude to keep about anything. You should always weigh the pros and cons for everything, even things you hate. There are things about the stock market that are amazing, and a smart investor will be able to make the most of it, even in a situation like 2008.

"Millennials are often portrayed as being irresponsible with their money or being lazy bums...

But the stereotype really took hold after 2008 when the finically crisis caused unemployment across the board to shoot up, and as a result companies were less eager to hire new talent and focused more on experienced hires (entry levels require insane qualifications...this is so companies get gold talent and pay lower wages). 

And being irresponsible with money because they buy higher quality items/food, but this is a factor of being an informed consumer. Millennial a will research and shop around for the best price, older generations would simply take a coupon out of the mail and go to a store thinking it was being smart. 

Millennials are also portrayed as bums living with their parents, but this again is because wages are low and housing costs the most it’s ever cost. Older generations could save up for 2-3 years working on the factory line and get a decent house, now millennial are pouring 40-50% of their salaries into crappy apartment rents and saving barely anything. 

I also don’t think millennials are the social media freaks, more the generation that is currently under 15...those kids are always on YouTube or some other app obsessed with the next vine star or another. 

All in all, millennials are adjusting to a new economy - lower population growth, lower wages, higher cost of living, and millennials like an increased standard of living too.

Many of them are graduating and finding a very hard time finding work, even with a good work ethic and solid credentials. I am personally seeing alot of college kids get hired on at jobs they are massivley overqualified for.

They deserve a new a system and I'm glad to see them being the ones to upend the existing one and lead the way.

Many of the gatekeepers now, when they were same age, had it easy. Let's be honest about that. You could get a college education for very low cost, and I know multiple stories from that generation, who paid for their college simply by working summer jobs at factories.

When they graduated, they literally just had to show up with a degree and they could get work. And investing, heck if you just buy and held, you would make a fortune simply by just being in the market.

Kids today have to deal with the following: 1) a terrible job market (even with full employment, the quality of jobs is much lower than in decades past. 2) skyrocketing, immoral financial burden of educational loans 3) ridiculous housing prices 4) shrinking wages due to global workforce competition";1;0;False;crypto_kang;dty16c5;Millennials Love Bitcoin And Hate Stocks;7w4731;https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2018/02/millennials-love-bitcoin-and-hate-stocks/

bitcoin noobs need to recognize the power of compound interest.  7-10% gains in stock market doesn't sound like much to a total fucking noob, but when you realize the nature of compounding interest and compounding growth, your $5500 a year contribution equates to 6000% gains *reliably* over time when you cash out to retire.  Because it's a lot easier to score 7-10% gains *reliably* than to pray your schlitzcoin goes to the moon.  You *need* 6000% gains just to keep up and then you gotta pay 15% capital gains tax on it when you yank it out.  My roth IRA doesn't get taxed when I pull out those sweet gains later in life.  I say do both, but your bare minimum, baseline investment should be a tax sheltered IRA fund.

"I personally think this is true due to the times we live in. Everybody wants quick info, quick gains, and something new. For alot of people the stock market is boring, which compared to crypto it is. The stock market also is a place where low amounts of capital wont change your life financially. Yes you can make money but the stock market doesnt have the potential crypto does in terms of changing your life financially. 

My first financial investment was crypto and I will soon begin investing in stocks. The real reason I got into crypto was its potential gains for being an early adopter. I didnt get into to get lambo in a year or two but more so for the potential financial security that could come if the project/coins I invest in hit like Amazon, google, and apple of the tech/.com era. 

I only invested what I was willing to lose and suggest that for all investments. The stock market is for the slow accumulation of wealth ( yes you can make insane gains if you hit on a stock, which is hard and unlikely). Crypto provides young investors a opportunity of a lifetime and these opportunities dont come often. Yes most coins will fail and alot of people will lose money. But for a small investment you could have massive returns which equal small risk=massive reward.

1. I get paid garbage mostly because big businesses who live and die by the stock market use their gains to lobby government so they don't have to pay me or any of us what we're worth. Buying stocks feels a bit like supporting that business model. Not interested. 

2. Watching how poorly ""serious"" hedge fund managers and other people who want to take a slice of my money do relative to index funds while turning their nose up at the rest of us is annoying and off-putting. The biggest bubble in history are their egos. 

3. 2008. Fannie and Freddie. Libor. Enron. Savings and Loan. Wells Fargo. Bailouts. HSBC. The list goes on and on and on. The history of Wall Street is fraud, theft, contempt for the ""little guy"". I'm not really interested in giving them my money to play with. 

4. I was a kid in the 90s and I watched the internet rise from a collection of obsecure dial up only message boards into what it is today. I remember being talked down to in  the 90s when I mentioned how cool I thought it was, hearing nothing but dismissive doom and gloom regarding the future of the internet. It was a fad, a flash in the pan, solved no problem that wasn't already solved by legacy systems, etc etc. Basically dinosaurs raining on my parade all along the way. 20+ years later,  that curious 10 year old kid has been vindicated. I thought I was watching a transformational tech emerge and I was right. Bitcoin is the internet of money. It's the first tech I've seen that is as transformative. The dinosaurs are still nay saying. I've learned to ignore them. 

6. The returns on the stock market are bullshit when you don't have a lot of money, and millennials in general don't have a lot of money. This means our risk tolerance is a LOT higher than the old guard. The corollary of that is parking what little money we have in an account that's kicking back a couple of percent means we'll be screwed come retirement if we do things by the book. For those of us at the older end of the generation, this is an especially salient point. 

So, for me, it's a combo of high risk tolerance, profound distrust in legacy financial systems and the parties the players in those systems support, a chance to have a retirement, the excitement of an impending technological sea change similar to the one I grew up with in the internet, and a realistic assessment of just how much money the old guard is willing to part with to make our lives better, while also ensuring that my money is going to me, not to some wallstreet chucklefuck who sees me and my thin account as pocket change to pad his bonus. 

Everything about Bitcoin and crypto is more appealing to me than stocks. ";307;18;False;ianandris;dtxjcem;Millennials Love Bitcoin And Hate Stocks;7w4731;https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2018/02/millennials-love-bitcoin-and-hate-stocks/

EDIT:

For those that aren't up to speed on the crypto-revolution yet, while people are needed to initially create a distributed system, they are not required to continually run it like a traditional company.

Once a cryptocurrency and system is built, anyone can invest in it by simply acquiring the tokens; there's no actual need to take risky investments on systems that aren't created yet.

Conversely a human operated system like say Walmart is subject to corruption, incompetence, and inefficiency; and would require constant trust and vigilance to fight against it.

Why would anyone take the risk? Especially when you get a feel for the corporate environment and how it is actually run.";9;8;False;_Marni_;dtxeeim;Millennials Love Bitcoin And Hate Stocks;7w4731;https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2018/02/millennials-love-bitcoin-and-hate-stocks/

For instance tokenizing the deed to your house and wrapping it a home equity loan smart contract @ 0% interest. If you fail to repay at term deed is auctioned via smart contract. No need to rent the capital from a usury agent. Of course diversify your investments but some or multiple iterations of crypto will massively alter the way the economy functions in the future and trying to compare it to gold valuations is grossly myopic. ;1;1;False;KingLeo23;dty7kzb;Millennials Love Bitcoin And Hate Stocks;7w4731;https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2018/02/millennials-love-bitcoin-and-hate-stocks/
Crypto is in the state a penny stock is in. Huge potential, massive uncertainty and could explode or collapse on the next news cycle. I don't invest in penny stocks for that very reason and I won't touch crypto yet either. It's great people are getting into investing but I don't think this is the right way. The latest crypto crash for example probably turned off many people expecting easy money. I always tell people to download robinhood and buy a share of apple stock if they want to get into investments.

"You hit the nail on the head here! 100%

The only thing I might add is the fact that the SEC has very tight controls over who can invest early into major technology innovations. As in, most companies start private to prevent hostile takeovers, which limits outsider investment to only the class of certified investors. To be a certified investor you need to already be a millionaire. 

There are some laws trying to change this, like Crowdfunder, but the limits are such that the amount you can invest are extremely strict. It has to be a set amount, like a certain percentage of your annual income. You can't simply put $100 down on a dozen cool companies to spread your risk.

Crypto, as it is a share of a network or a commidity, rather than a security (in most cases) - nicely loops around these laws. And while I understand the need for consumer protection, a lot of those laws just exist to keep the working class poor as hell and permanently endentured to our plutacracy.

At some stage, sweeping over-regulation will damage crypto permanently in the US, China, Europe. Then, around the world, countries that embrace it will find much more efficient economies and greater consumer power. If anything, we'll end up with a scenario where people running mining operations in their basements in the first world are simply providing financial services to the entire third world, but can't access the same services themselves because of failing democracies and regulatory capture. There would be some truly existential irony in that scenario.

Of course, I HOPE it remains a permnently accessible asset class to everybody. It'd be nice to hav e some protections, and an international risk/rating system for ICOs, but hey, you can't beat investing into any emerging market - and crypto is one of the only emerging markets that consumers can actually access.";27;2;False;ion-tom;dtxn8ux;Millennials Love Bitcoin And Hate Stocks;7w4731;https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2018/02/millennials-love-bitcoin-and-hate-stocks/

"You invest in the asset because you expect the value of it to rise. If the value is rising, it means each month you buy less of it for the same amount of cash. 

Your 100 might buy you 100 zcoin, and over the course of the month it doubles in value. Your next investment only secures 50 more zcoin, and your 200 has only bought you 150 zcoin.

OTOH if you buy 200 right away, by next month when it doubles in value you still have 200 zcoin. 

IRL this is much less exaggerated (you probably don't expect BTC to double in a month) but the only time helps you is if you happen to start investing before a dip. If the coin is losing value more often than it is gaining value, you will come ahead from DCA because you mitigated your losses, but you are losing money. OTOH if there is more growth than dips (the value goes up over time) then it is more likely a random investment time is not right before a dip.

"I wish they would just ban cigarettes. I get that the country was founded on nicotine income and whatever.

It's just that, research literally shows that, almost 90 percent of lung cancer is directly caused by smoking. We're talking about natural and artificial lung cancer -- 87 percent of that is from cigarettes. How is that not bannable? The FDA bans pharmaceuticals that have caused bad side effects. Yet they can't ban cigarettes for some weird reason.

And people will argue that it's about freedom and free will. But then why is meth banned? Is it because it messes with your head? Cigarettes mess with your head too.

Someone should make a campaign with like a guy who walks up to a counter and points his finger at one of those fake bitcoin coins instead of pointing at the cigarette carton. Then there should be a huge caption that says, ""In 10 years, his cigarette allowance turned into millions.""

"Seems like it's a more common strategy than I'd realised -- I'm also feeding some of what I would have smoked into Bitcoin since I quit a few weeks ago. 

I'm not putting it directly into Bitcoin, into the exchange first in Fiat and then converting to Bitcoin when the time seems right. I managed to get the first lot in within a few hundred dollars of the bottom of the dip, luckily. 

It's not much, but it certainly passes the ""afford to lose it"" test, as I would have just smoked it anyway -- and the potential to end up with a bit of a nest egg is indeed a powerful motivation to keep off the cigs.

Regarding quitting, it's a good thing that vapes exist. I couldn't imagine succeeding with just cold turkey or any of the patches/gum stuff that was the only option before.

"**Dollar cost averaging**

Dollar cost averaging (DCA) is an investment strategy with the goal of reducing the impact of volatility on large purchases of financial assets such as equities. Dollar cost averaging is also called the constant dollar plan (in the US), pound-cost averaging (in the UK), and, irrespective of currency, as unit cost averaging or the cost average effect.

By dividing the total sum to be invested in the market (e.g. $100,000) into equal amounts put into the market at regular intervals (e.g.

"This is how to do it in my experience. You have to Yoda it. Do or do not. There is no try. The people that *try* to quit smoking usually end up *trying* their whole lives unsuccessfully. It's a mental trick that puts you in control. 

What made the difference for me was to make it a rule- No more buying packs. Then i could still have one at a party or something without breaking my rule and feeling like a failure. Without having them around for a couple weeks to smoke when I was bored the obsession faded and I didn't crave it anymore.

Yeah i tried to quit for years. Used patches and nicorette gum. Didnt try chantix. Anyways one day I just said fuck it and bought 2 packs of regular old spearmint gum from the store instead of 2 packs of smokes. I just kept chewing gum every time I wanted a smoke. After about a month or so the cravings started to fade. After about 3 months I chewed gum less often. Finally after about a year I was able to stop chewing gum for that purpose. The urges went away.

"When you put in a portion of your paycheck there is not an oppurtunity cost. You aren't losing potential money from hesitating to buy the assets. When you have 1000 dollars expendable but only invest 100 at a time you are making less (generally) than the more conventional strategy of investing 1000 right away. OTOH if you have 100 dollars, invest it right away, you are following a more conventional strategy. And after expenses next month when you have 100 more expendable and invest it right away, you are following the conventional strategy again.

I used Chantix. Some of the worst possible side effects of any drug out there, but that shit made me literally disgusted by cigarettes. You keep smoking while you take it and within a few weeks you have no urge to smoke a cigarette at all.

"> I'm a truck driver

So am I. Am also slavering nicotine addict. 

Get yerself a low ohm vape.  Works better if you give up the ciggies for 48 hours first then use it when the craving kicks in.

I actually *enjoyed* Chantix/Champix.  It gave me crazy, acid grade dreams.  Great fun, though nearly passing out if I picked something off the floor wasn't.  It also took all the fun out of alcohol, which sounds bad, but I was getting worried about my drinking so I took the opportunity to give that up as well.

"Just a heads up, DCA is when you have a lump sum available but choose to invest it in portions over time. For example if you had 24k in savings and invested 2k a month from it you are DCA. OTOH spending a portion of your paycheck is just plain investing. 

Also if you do have the opportunity to DCA, I recommend not doing it. It only saves you if you begin before a major slump or crash, which is pretty dumb luck if you can't tell the future (and if you can you'd be rich already.) From historical data it is the better choice to invest the lump sum right away the majority of the time.

>Calculating Market Cap

>Market capitalization is just a fancy name for a straightforward concept: it is the market value of a company's outstanding shares. This figure is found by taking the stock price and multiplying it by the total number of shares outstanding.
