"Advice I wish I'd been given at 17 years:  

Get out of debt, then stay out of debt.   

Save an emergency cash cushion: enough to pay all your bills for one full year (two years, even better).  

In addition to that, save up for your old age (don't count on government programs). Don't put all your eggs into just one or two baskets. Make sure one of those baskets is Bitcoin.  

Don't bother with ""alt-coins"".  

Don't invest heavily in things you don't understand.

Remember: **not your keys, not your Bitcoin**. Don't store your Bitcoin on anybody's exchange/web site/etc. any longer than necessary.  

Once you've learned the basics of how to, then consider investing more and more.  

Beware of scams/scammers. This includes people touting their ""TA"" (technical analysis). TA is bullshit - sadly, even smart people can fall for it. Don't ""loan"" your Bitcoin to anyone. Fools and their money are soon parted. Pigs get fat; hogs get slaughtered.

"> only specially blessed computers can hold dollars. The protocols for how to send dollars electronically

Computers don't hold Dollars and there is no way to send Dollars electronically, since there is no electronic Dollar in existence. What you mean is that claims on Dollars sitting in a bank vault are exchanged via a message: ""$5 Dollars owned by costumer 1 in bank A are now owned by customer 2 in Bank B"". No Dollar is exchanged, when transmitting and confirming this message, but in the end actual Dollars claimed have to be exchanged, because a bank can go bankrupt and then the claims become worthless. The banks themselves don't even hold as many Dollars in their vaults and don't exchange them physically, but keep them in an account with a central bank. Then actual Dollars sitting in the central banks are shifted from bank A's to bank B's account. They are not shifted physically, but just in the books of the central bank. If the banks are with different central banks, it gets even more complicated. One might note that central banks do not hold actual Dollars, but just claims of banks. This is true, but these ""virtual Dollars"" can never leave a central bank, they have to be printed on paper. If customer 2 with bank B wants to withdraw his $5 and bank B's vault is empty, then bank B has to withdraw Dollars from its account with the central bank. If the central bank has no Dollar notes left, it has to print and physically ship them to the bank, simply because there is no electronic Dollar.";1;3;False;bitsteiner;ff77jp0;The Fed Has Pumped $500 Billion Into the Repo Market.

"> Talk about magic internet money.

Its very ironic that people see bitcoin as complex and the dollar as simple. 

Nothing could be further from the truth. 

The totality of bitcoin is a few pages of design details. Its utterly transparent and simple, possibly as simple as a money system can be. Its money reduced to the most elemental mathematical form.

The fiat dollar, in comparison, is an amazingly complex scheme. It spans multiple types of media, it can wink in and out of existence, it has miles and miles of pages of rules about its function, when and where and how it can be spent or redeemed, and those rules change all the time. 

The dollar has no true settlement system; for things to settle, the main method is used is ""wait a long, indeterminate time"". Even the methods advertised as irreversible, such as cashiers checks, cash deposits, and wire transfers, can be reversed. 

You cannot simply create a new server or hardware device and put dollars into it; only specially blessed computers can hold dollars. The protocols for how to send dollars electronically are secretive, and require special blessings from high priests to work. If you try to send or receive dollars from your computer to other computers without those blessings, it wont work, and would land you in jail.

The dollar is its own antiparticle, because a debt dollar and an earned dollar are the same. 

The dollar system requires a huge set of wizards bureaucrats and administrators just to keep it functioning, and if they stopped it would spin out of control. And no matter how hard they try, it eventually spins out anyway, and they have to fight to pick up the pieces and start it over again, at a great cost to the public.";35;2;False;mj2gg2ltifhegqkq;ff6yror;The Fed Has Pumped $500 Billion Into the Repo Market.

High risk **can** = high reward. If you could know for sure that in 20 years BTC is worth $100,000 and you would rather have things now then sell. Otherwise there is a possibility you make a lot with it. But with that also comes the risk of losing all of it. Personally as a teenager you have a lot of time to make the money back and now is a good time to take financial risks while you have parents that can take care of you (I'm assuming). In these situations I tend to take the advice of Warren buffet in saying that he never sells his stock because owing a stock or in this case a coin that **may** fail, is like owning a lottery ticket. Might as well keep it. My completely informal and casual advice would be to hold because crypto is as big if not bigger than the internet. I also am holding and continuing to buy but with the understanding that I could lose everything. Remember this is not formal advice so do whatever you feel comfortable doing.;4;1;False;Patagonia246;ff6hvat;I want to exchange all my btc to bank and spend it on irl stuff . i am going to do that in march .

">Can’t imagine how it must feel living in a country where there’s no second chances!!

Most of these men have been given 2nd or 3rd chances. Most had multiple felony convictions before being sentenced to life. 

On the surface, we should be sympathetic towards these guys because society should advocate for lesser punishments for non-violent drug offenses. Yes, these men are jailed for life due to non-violent drug convictions, but that doesn't erase their prior criminal history.

From the picture, here's a brief rundown of these men. The main takeaways: 1) most are repeat offenders and already had their 2nd/3rd chances, 2) some have history of violent crimes

Shawn Sorenson – two prior drug felonies (repeater). Possession of coke and meth, multiple guns

Jawad Musa – reverse sting, received call from undercover offering him coke for 20k, he met the undercover and showed cash, no drugs ever exchanged, but convicted for life

* *This guy I sympathize with and can't find any history indicating he warrants a life sentence. He's been imprisoned for 28 years because he was framed*

Anthony Dejohn – possession of marijuana and 4 guns, **two prior felonies for assault**

Patricio paladin – cocaine, 3rd felony (repeater)

Victor brown – fentanyl/cocaine (distribution), gun in nightstand (not unusual), previously pled guilty to robbery

Jose “bat” Marquez – large history of crimes/gang/cartel activity, multiple stays in prison

Khary Ancrum – cocaine distributor, two prior drug felonies

Jonahan Homedew – trafficked meth from CA to IA, no prior history found

* *Used USPS to ship meth across state lines making it a federal offense but 30 year sentence is harsh*

Jose Delacruz – meth distribution, two prior drug felonies

&#x200B;

From what I found, only Ulbricht, Homedew, and Musa have no history of priors and whom I believe were the only ones punished too harshly. The rest were given multiple chances and wasted them.";26;8;False;lovemyhawks;ff6y7rc;A photo and message from Ross Ulbricht for the new year;erxgd7;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/erxgd7/a_photo_and_message_from_ross_ulbricht_for_the/

He's going to have come across a president that's a secret Bitcoin trader, or has an affinity for the onion router, or is a closeted LSD freak that buys his shit off of the darknet. No president in their right mind would pardon you Ross, I'm sorry to get your hopes dashed here, that would be political suicide. 

You've got to see your status as the United States federal government sees it... You are in essence the poster child for creating an avenue for drug dealers to remain anonymous and make boatloads of money from the privacy of their own home, using the United States postal service as their mules. Now maybe you didn't sell drugs maybe you weren't into drugs I don't know you but you administrated the marketplace that allowed that. I'm not going to castigate you for what you did because I'm in no position to do that. I like being honest with people so here it is. 

You see what you did was wrong, you aren't some wrongfully accused innocent in all this. you can say you didn't know what was going to happen or you didn't know people were going to sell drugs and whatever they were selling, of course you did... that's why you created the marketplace. So people could do whatever the fuck they wanted and they did and that's how you got caught. Can't cry over spilled milk now. you're only upset because you got caught... had you gotten away would you ever admitted to what you did or thought what you did was wrong? Of course not. 

I don't know you so I don't want to sit here and judge you but, how much money did you make off silk road? And you might not be a violent offender according to the United States government and the laws that we have in place here, but I guarantee you at some point an individual who bought drugs off silk road either committed a violent act because of the drugs they received or vice versa. Silk Road on the surface may not have been directly responsible but you opened a portal that was never opened before, that nobody ever in the history of the world created. I think it was innovative as hell, brilliant idea, but unfortunately you got caught.

And you created a ripple effect in the drug world with silk road. You can't look at yourself as a non-violent offender, that is the complete wrong attitude for you to have and that's why the only interest I've seen from anyone about your case and helping you are random idiots on Twitter who say they have your back and the reason they say that is to make some sort of social media statement to their followers.

The issue I've had with you ever since...well since I'm being pretty honest here I might as well go all in....
... why not.

I was a drug dealer on silk road. I also used to buy shit on silk road for myself because I was a drug user. You helped make me about 3,000 bitcoin back when they were a fraction of the value they are now. So I have to thank you to a certain degree. I was able to get mine out of silk road and put them through coin mixers and hide  in monero and then zcash and then decred. Silk road and Bitcoin changed me. it changed the course of my life not for the better don't confuse what I'm saying here I have a lot of money yeah but my life is not what it should be. It's a wasted life. I was going to school for computer programming, I was and still am a very intelligent person in certain aspects of life, but I stupidly dropped out of college because I got hooked on drugs... specifically oxycontin, which then accelerated to heroin, that I was buying off of silk road.  

Whether you committed the violent act yourself or not, you created an avenue that facilitates drug trafficking at a heavy level anonymously, that historically and statistically and from personal experience let me tell you it actually will facilitate and fuel violent scenarios. You can be the Mahatma Gandhi but if your trafficking in narcotics, statistically you will be exposed to violent behavior and most likely have violence attempted at you at the very least. 

Whether you're a user or dealer or both.... The drug world will turn you into a different person and in many cases it turns you into a violent person, I've seen it happen too many times, so by sitting there with what appears like zero remorse, continually stating you are a nonviolent offender, it really cheapens the thought that you learned any lesson while you've been there other than your bitching and whining to get out since you got in. 

Dude how long have you been in prison? Like 5 years? Christ I did more time than you have... Do yourself a favor get another decade under your belt and then maybe come back out with the petition. From what I've seen with you in the media you show zero remorse, you act as if you did no wrong, you just opened up a marketplace, and you shouldn't be responsible for the aftermath. Do you ever lay awake at night and wonder how many people died because of silk road? I guarantee you the number would haunt you for eternity.  

Whether it was an overdose on drugs, or getting shot in the face due to a drug deal gone bad, silk road caused deaths. I'm not trying to be an asshole here man, but I've lived in the drug world and I got out. Drugs destroy families, they destroy people, they destroy children, they destroy lives. Some people can do them and go about their life normally other people end up lying, stealing or even killing for them. You know how many instances of of those things you created by starting silk road? Countless. You are a violent offender. You just weren't convicted of a violent crime because there isn't a law against inadvertently facilitating murder with 3 degrees of separation. Don't get it twisted man a lot of violence occurred because of the silk road. Just cuz you weren't the one beating somebody's face in with a bat for a couple of ecstasy pills doesn't mean you aren't partially responsible for that face beating.

I'm in no position to judge you because I've done a lot worse shit than you but the difference between two of us is... So far as I can tell I got away with it. And moved on with my life and away from the drug world. Maybe what you need to do is show a little bit more interest in the hurt that you did cause people, and try to make some of that right. 

I bet you still have a shitload of Bitcoin don't you? You can tell the press and sheep followers whatever you want, but no way in the world somebody with the skill set a programmer like yourself has doesn't hide some  that nobody knows about. Do yourself a favor... donate some anonymously... 

You know I just thought of this...you created a marketplace where yourself and all the criminals within could remain anonymous.... well pseudonymous really.... And now all you want to do is tell everybody your name.

"Copying from my other comment as it seems relevant:

Most of these men have been given 2nd or 3rd chances. Most had multiple felony convictions before being sentenced to life.

On the surface, we should be sympathetic towards these guys because society should advocate for lesser punishments for non-violent drug offenses. Yes, these men are jailed for life due to non-violent drug convictions, but that doesn't erase their prior criminal history.

From the picture, here's a brief rundown of these men. The main takeaways: 1) most are repeat offenders and already had their 2nd/3rd chances, 2) some have history of violent crimes

Shawn Sorenson – two prior drug felonies (repeater). Possession of coke and meth, multiple guns

Jawad Musa – reverse sting, received call from undercover offering him coke for 20k, he met the undercover and showed cash, no drugs ever exchanged, but convicted for life

* *This guy I sympathize with and can't find any history indicating he warrants a life sentence. He's been imprisoned for 28 years because he was framed*

Anthony Dejohn – possession of marijuana and 4 guns, **two prior felonies for assault**

Patricio paladin – cocaine, 3rd felony (repeater)

Victor brown – fentanyl/cocaine (distribution), gun in nightstand (not unusual), previously pled guilty to robbery

Jose “bat” Marquez – large history of crimes/gang/cartel activity, multiple stays in prison

Khary Ancrum – cocaine distributor, two prior drug felonies

Jonahan Homedew – trafficked meth from CA to IA, no prior history found

* *Used USPS to ship meth across state lines making it a federal offense but 30 year sentence is harsh*

Jose Delacruz – meth distribution, two prior drug felonies

From what I found, only Ulbricht, Homedew, and Musa have no history of priors and whom I believe were the only ones punished too harshly.

Bitcoin is like wearing a mask. You will still be seen on camera it's just very difficult to know for absolutely certain who is behind it. But you are definitely still seen on camera. Therefore you can still be tracked. 

Also mining bitcoin nowadays takes more time and investment than buying bitcoin. This is because it takes a specialized computer called an ASIC. Brace yourself for another analogy.

Middle mans like banks are needed for a functioning system if this system is ever meant to get to a serious size. The concept of a middle man like a bank or a payment provider also isn’t a bad one. What is bad and what’s bad with the current system we have is the power distribution where these middle man hold more power then the other parties.

it replaces the likes of bitpay and allows you to run your on PoS system for your online shop WITHOUT a middleman

it's an awesome piece of software. like say you are running a online shop, you connect that with your own instance of btcpay and then when someone goes to checkout it generates a QR code and does the whole checkout shebang and tells your shop ""yep they paid""


it's basically selfhosted ""middleman"" service so you don't need a middleman if that makes sense

"Did you even read what you linked? It only argues that *1/3* of the premises in the quote isn’t found anywhere in Jefferson’s writings.

He didn’t say the first part of the quote, and *definitely* said the second part of the quote, and the third portion appears to be paraphrasing something Jefferson said, according to the link you provided.


>The first part of the quotation (""If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their Fathers conquered"") has not been found anywhere in Thomas Jefferson's writings, to Albert Gallatin or otherwise. It is identified in Respectfully Quoted as spurious, and the editor further points out that the words ""inflation"" and ""deflation"" are not documented until after Jefferson's lifetime.

>The second part of the quotation (""I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies"") is a slight misquotation of a statement Jefferson made in a letter to John Taylor in 1816. He wrote, ""And I sincerely believe with you, that banking establishments are more dangerous than standing armies; & that the principle of spending money to be paid by posterity, under the name of funding, is but swindling futurity on a large scale""

>The third part of this quotation (""The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people, to whom it properly belongs"") may be a misquotation of Jefferson's comment to John Wayles Eppes in 1813, ""Bank-paper must be suppressed, and the circulating medium must be restored to the nation to whom it belongs.""

"Yea, I think the value of debt becomes apparent when it allows you to purchase a home for the first time 20 years sooner than in cash, but if prices weren't inflated, would I still care? Could it become normal for people to just buy outright or wouldn't some share of people always be seeking debt to get the house/car sooner, or to get two houses and generate an income stream from renting? 

My first exposure to all of this was Ray Dalio's video on the Economic Machine, it's clear and coherent and I wish it were required watching. So many people will never care, they don't need to understand that their money doesn't retain value because they have no money, in fact if their debts are dollar denominated then they might benefit when the dollar is worth less over time so long their wage increases to compensate, which it probably won't.

For Bitcoin though, it's complicated. What is it really - techno-optimistic money that computers can use; or an apocalyptic safe-haven asset, I'm not sure we get to have both. The monetary policy at least is teachable, it's simpler than the existing system by merit of a few fixed rules that allow us to show what will happen in the future. As for the rest?

You mention ‘money keeps moving’ but I’m not clear what you’re saying about one dollar paying off multiple debts.  My understanding is that every dollar is currently *underwriting* multiple debts, which is a very fragile condition.

"There are dozens of arguments in favor of bitcoin use, and this video draws attention to one of them.  It’s true that this video doesn’t explicitly say it, but the point it’s making is that all the other problems you reference *are themselves* more of the predicted consequences of this system: all of the problems you reference are examples of the unaffordability of life today.  

If you are being taxed today by all the taxes you voluntarily pay, and you are effectively being taxed *from the past* by being paid in debt-driven currency decoupled from its monetary base, and you are effectively being taxed *from the future* by the necessity of inflation to balance the books... 

...then nearly all the value *you* produced by exchanging your personal time for work - effort that you’d not prefer to expend but for the monetary compensation you get from it - is being extracted from you.

Low unemployment can be a very very bad sign if it’s because people need to work two jobs to pay for fewer things than only one of their parents had to work part time for only forty years ago.

When we compare a 1913 dollar to a 2020 dollar, the the 1913 dollar can be thought of as solid, and the 2020 dollar is a shell with 95% of its insides hollowed out.  If our country has more wealth, more product, more intellectual property, more *real* property than we had 100 years ago, then how is the money that’s supposed represent it be worth so much *less* than it used to instead of more?  It’s because all the value we produce, that we should have majority right to, goes to people who control the flow of money first.

Ergo, even though you and EVERYBODY ELSE work harder and longer than your parents did,  you likely have less functional health care at a far higher price; you have mental health care needs because you’re working far harder than you’re supposed to for what you have; we have so many prisoners because we’ve criminalized every aspect of having too little money, and when you have too little money to be allowed to receive any more money... your only option is to take things without using money, i.e., commiting further crimes.

All of these things are what ‘systemic poverty’ LOOKS LIKE.  You forgot to mention the rising costs of education, by the way.  Which is, again, more of the same problem.

Everything is getting worse because everything we’re trying to build for ourselves has been rendered worthless.  At the end of the day, everything is always a money problem at its most fundamental level because money is literally the language of exchanging *what we have* for *what we need*.  For EVERY need.

So.  What’s one solution to this problem? Stop participating in it whenever and wherever possible.  Create and participate in an honest local economy with people you trust, with a reliable medium of exchange that conserves its value and cannot be meddled with by a bad actor.  Bitcoin happens to work remarkably well for this purpose.";6;0;False;ritmusic2k;ff6t4gr;When people ask me why is bitcoin good, the first video I show them is this.;ervt7q;https://youtu.be/G9IH-XKQpOI?t=2
"Yes 100%, that's a fragile system that has repeatedly gotten out of control and led to a cascade of failures like in 2008. When debt is being used transparently it can accelerate the economy, which is usually great. It's partially dependent on the feedback loop between credit supply and demand for borrowing to set the interest rate. The interest rate also functions as compensation for taking on risk that a debt won't be repaid. Then as you said, if debt is used to underwrite other debts, or repackaged to obfuscate its risk, this complicates the risk assessment we lose the ability to properly set interest rates.

Things spiral out of control until the Fed jumps in with a massive increase in the money supply to erase some of the debts and provide liquidity to the system. In theory this would be used to unwind these layered debts but that's a lot of work, only going to happen if you force the banks to do it.

The fallacy is the idea that loans break the rule of assets=liabilities because a $100 loan with $10 interest leaves behind the interest when the loan is paid. Part of the puzzle for the fallacy is that increasing money supply by issuing loans will decrease interest rates - which as we've seen can be driven into the negatives if necessary. I don't have a good answer for the rest of the issue, I'm currently digesting this [article](http://www.georgistjournal.org/2014/01/31/the-ever-expanding-debt-money-fallacy/).

"Just heard this on the radio.  No transcript yet, but the gist is that bank withdrawals are severely limited and it sounds like economy is collapsing due to capital controls.

I'm looking forward to the day when a significant portion of the population will keep at least a small portion of their savings in bitcoin.  In my mind, this is the ideal use case and could provide a lifeline for those who just want to buy basic medical supplies or diapers like those in the interview.

Let's keep our eyes on the prize and work toward providing that lifeline.  In my mind we need volatility to continue dropping (it seems to be happening little by little), continue investing in scaling tech (LN, pegged sidechains, Schnorr, etc.), and UX.  I'm optimistic on all these fronts.

Anyway, the need is real, and I'm proud to be a part of this community.  You guys rock - keep it up.

"As far as far as I know (not a legal advice of course):

In the USA ordering medicine out of country is legal if :

a) the medicine (same brand name and dose) is available/listed in the USA

b) a foreign doctor prescribed it following an IN PERSON visit (there is a deadline too, like not more than a year ago or something like that)

(+more, but these two are easy to see and see that you can't fit

"Hi Matt, in regards to point number 4 - what if I've bought smaller amounts of btc many times for the purpose of holding, but with a more random timing, irregular pattern - kind of DCA in a way - and then go on to sell a large amount in one go when btc moons? How would we calculate the profit/loss for taxation on all of those smaller purchases? 

Would I need to painstakingly go back to check through transactions then sell the equivalent of purchases multiple times? This wouldn't be ideal should the price moon and then wish to cash out in one go.

This really confuses me, I'll appreciate any insight you can offer.

"I don't wanna be a bear but just want to let you know a few things because I was at the same position a few years ago.

- Research! I see you call this an investment, use it as an opportunity to learn more about Bitcoin, its fundamentals and it's history (why it came about). With that said, never go into an investment without knowing what it is you're investing in.


As a part of this, whenever you invest in anything - do it in a way without bias (people telling you to, connection to investment [i.e. emotional, family, friends, etc]) and do your own research and make up your own mind.


- Inform your parents. Might sound stupid but let them know, especially as you are using their details. I'd say once you're 18 they don't have to know about where your money is going but definitely for now do so. I wish I did at the time. I understand I may come across as someone that is belittling you and that's not my intention but in the case of anything happening, you'll find it easier to talk to them and they'll be able to help.  


- Own your crypto. Get a wallet outside of an exchange, this can be a desktop wallet, paper wallet, hardware wallet, mobile wallet etc. Research and find one thats good for you. Coinbase is a 'wallet' but you don't own the keys - find one that does. It is a bit more work but you own your crypto so in the event an exchange gets hacked or bankrupt, you're not affected. Also, keep (multiple) backups of any keys/seed phrases as these will be used to recover in the event of loss (device/corruption/etc)


- Minimise costs. With Coinbase, the fees are pretty high... but with your same account details you can access Coinbase Pro and the fees are so much lower and you have more control over your trades. There is a learning curve at first but most is googlable. Also, something to consider is that they allow you to withdraw without additional fees so in the process of moving to your own wallet, you won't lose any bitcoin.


- Don't try to time the market. Many people try to do this, and it make sense: buy low, sell high. But for most, it doesn't work out right. So it's best to buy and hold for long term investment. Never try to outsmart/outthink the market because it's likely it won't be successful.


- Hindsight is 20:20. If you see something that just shot up a lot and you think that you should've bought more rather than the little amount you did, there's no point dwelling on it. You analysed the risk and acted at a level you're comfortable with. Same goes for the other way, if something drops and you bought a lot, you should be comfortable with the risk associated and understood that it was a possibility. Basically, don't dwell but figure out your risk tolerance and all's calm.


- Diversify! If this is purely an investment and not because Bitcoin gives you more freedom over your money, invest elsewhere too! ETFs, Stocks and Shares etc - by not putting all your eggs in one basket, you minimise risk and put yourself in a much stronger position.


- Don't invest more than you can afford to lose. If it all goes to 0 overnight, make sure you won't be that badly affected. Obviously as a 'child' you can rely on your parents and you can afford to take risks but make sure you understand the risks.


Not saying it will go to 0 but the due to the nature of cryptocurrency, it can wildly fluctuate in ways that normal stocks usually won't.


Lastly, may sound kinda stupid given everything I just said, you kinda gotta pick and choose which ones to actually listen to and which ones do/don't apply to you. I hope it helps you out and hope it didn't come across too preachy!

My recommendations: Don't focus on price. Learn.

"Congrats, just know that what seems like a lot of money at 15 is pennies when you get older. Try to keep things in perspective and DON'T sell. If you're able to DCA every week or month or whatever do it, in four years you'll likely be able to pay your way through college. **Edit**: Just to explain myself a little bit more for anybody doubting this, if you Dollar Cost Average at 75 dollars per month for four years that gives you a total investment of about 3600 dollars. If bitcoin increases by 10X in four years like many anticipate that it will, you'll have ROUGHLY 36,000 dollars, which is likely enough to pay for college depending on where you want to go.  

When I was 15 I was very impulsive, if friends wanted to go out and do something I'd blow all of my money. Don't do that if you can, try to stay frugal and don't ever touch your bitcoin, treat bitcoin like your life savings.

"Don't put in anymore. Be very, very, very wary of the rush that will come if the price goes up. That's dopamine, and it can get addictive really fast. 

Don't watch the price every minute, or hour, or even every day. It will drive you mad. 

Not every project you read about on Reddit is a good one, or even a real one. Many will fail. Many are scams to take your money. I would avoid reading about alt coins entirely. 

If you haven't already, read about Bitcoin. Why it exists, the pros and cons of it. 

Learn more, invest less. Be patient. You're 15, which is a good age to be aware of investing. Crypto was my introduction to investing and led to my interest in equities. If you learn about long-term holding vs short-term, tax implications, and dollar cost averaging, those lessons apply to traditional stocks and funds. 

I would think of this as a start to your investing career. If you start investing small amounts of money at 18 (when you legally can), the compound interest can be HUGE, and you will be set up to retire well before your friends.

"A few things.

1. Don't do a lot of trading, when you cash out you'll be expected to pay taxes on your earnings and if you trade a lot it becomes next to impossible to really figure it all out.
2. Have a certain amount that you don't touch for like 5 years/10 years, etc.
3. I'd recommend a hardware wallet, and keep your wallet safe. It's easy to want to talk about it, etc. But there are bad people in this world and you do need to be careful if it does ever go really high.
4. If you sell or trade what you bought before a year the capital gains tax is a lot more so I'd recommend not touching anything you buy within a year. Also there's FIFO (First in First out), or something, and I believe it means if you bought 1 btc in 2008, 1 btc in 2010 and 1 btc in 2019, and you have 3 btc in you rwallet. Then you sell 1 btc, the btc that would be thought to have been sold is the 1 btc in 2008 because it was the FI (First in). Therefore the taxes would be calculated by taking the price that you purchased that 1 btc in 2008 and not the other prices you purchased your other coins in.";1;1;False;MattPilkerson;ff6fgu5;15 y/o ,Just invested 75$ in btc for first time ever and plan to do more!

"This is all very new and very unclear, I'll attempt my thoughts.

If it's a pure repo, as in a ""repurchase"" agreement, then you're on the hook for capital gains since you *sell* only to repurchase later. No different than selling on exchange. On top, you'd need to consider the fee/rate in the repo, that's also profit/loss.

If the contract is a swap, things could be different. In a repo ownership changes, and say in the event of a fork it's the new owner who gets the forked coins. With a swap, ownership might remain with you, so no cap gains and keep forks. But the fee would be profit/loss.

"Well the point of the question isn't how do you make it work, because that's obvious. What I'm wondering is: what is the incentive? I want to understand why would anyone want to use Bitcoin and especially: why would businesses?

I'm starting to think that if fiat currency is obsoleted and Bitcoin becomes the common currency (likely wouldn't happen for a few decades or more), you still have the same problem with exchange rate fluctuation because the token value varies. But you save on faster transactions that reduce risk of value variation and you have the added security. This is all assuming you don't have any other cryptocurrencies at your disposal (which you likely would). 

How much is this worth to businesses? I can foresee companies (banks, insurance companies and the like) lobbying like big tobacco does against weed and vaping.

"\> If I was on the receiving end of a large (millions of dollars) purchase, a 0.1% change in the value of Bitcoin is worth $1000, so I could very easily see the volatility of Bitcoin wiping out the benefits of the extremely low transaction fees.

Under most fiat methods of transfer moving millions costs you in fees and exchange rates more than that 0.1% volatility, mind you. And Bitcoin is also faster and irreversible.

But your point about volatility is of course valid. Bitcoin is volatile because it's not as liquid as the top currencies. When it usurps the Dollar as the reserve currency of the world, you can bet that pricing any deal in Dollars would seem insanely volatile (as it's hyper-inflating). Just like people in Venezuela no longer price any meaning transaction in Bolivars.

> That makes Bitcoin sound like a tax/fee avoidance vehicle for rich people and corporations than a currency. 

Politics is a tax avoidance/collection vehicle for rich people and corporations. Bitcoin is a way for the smaller fish to protect their wealth from the tax known as inflation. It doesnt help with other types of taxes, but inflation is still a very nasty and unfair business.

"The tax authorities in the U.K. can’t even trace cash in hand payments for self employee people and they certainly can’t collect those lost taxes.

As for Bitcoin and other crypto coins they are more opaque but believe me when you hear a lot of noise from HMRC it’s just scare mongering noise, they really haven’t got to capacity or man power to trace every transaction.

If they had they wouldn’t be offering 100k for anyone who can come up with software that’s guaranteed to bunch transaction 🤔.

Further more you’d have to be an idiot to pay all that tax on a BTC gain when you could simply pay someone in a no tax jurisdiction a fraction of that for helping you cash out your money.

I’m convinced you’ll see those offers in the future from individuals in crypto tax haven areas.

"For those reading this trying to make heads or tails of this here's the deal: when you make a bitcoin wallet using an app it practically screams at you to back up the seed phrase which can instantly reconstitute the entire balance anywhere, anytime on practically any other wallet. Just in case you lose your phone, or any other mishap (including the bungling excuse that Schiff used that the app malfunctioned and corrupted the data-seed phrases can't be corrupted). This seed phrase can then be further encrypted with an optional passphrase which enables you to secure it even further such that even if someone sees your seed phrase it is useless to them because they would need to input the correct passphrase once they try to reconstitute the wallet. So you have multiple levels of protection and backups. Bitcoin was designed like this.

Peter Schiff's story is more a lesson of a lack of understanding about Bitcoin and how coins are stored. Schiff thought he lost his coins because his blockchain.com wallet became corrupted and no longer accepted his password. Even if this is true he didn't actually lose his coins, the webwallet devs behind blockchain.com could easily see what went wrong and restore access to his wallet. Obviously Schiff shouldn't be using a webwallet at all and backup his 12 or 24 word seed like all normal wallets tell you to.;1;0;False;Miz4r_;ff6ecno;Peter Schiff's story is a great lesson for anyone who is new to the world of Bitcoin;erspx5;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/erspx5/peter_schiffs_story_is_a_great_lesson_for_anyone/

"Because there is no guarantee whatsoever that 10x will happen. There is no way to have future knowledge regarding human driven systems. We can calculate when an eclipse will happen or when celestial bodies will be in alignment, and many other accurate future knowledge based on physical principles. But economics is really just mass psychology. There are some principles that hold true, but they rely on human factors being unchanged to make accurate predictions.

For instance, you can be relatively certain that when the supply of dollars increases relative to a good or asset , that the price in dollars will increase. However this only holds true if the demand remains unchanged, and demand is much more difficult to model and understand than supply. The majority of demand is in constant flux, with a lower stable underlying demand that is independent of current market conditions. As the price of Bitcoin goes down, people get turned off and less interested in buying, and the opposite when the price is going up. This is why the price always over and undershoots.

So basically,  many believe (myself included) that the reduced daily supply will manifest as a significant price increase over the next 18months, which sets off a chain reaction that draws in new demand. But there is absolutely no certainty that we will see that new demand, and is just as possible that something happens to reduce demand.

The next reason people arent buying now is simply they don't know about it. Very few people in general have any kind of understanding of how to evaluate various kinds of investments. Even smaller number of people understand the disinflationary design of Bitcoin. And even further, among those who understand,  many get hung up on ""a deflationary currency isnt good for the economy"" ; which is just funny because nobody complains about their gold or stocks deflating aka prices rising. 

Essentially this boils down to two reasons. First and foremost 10x is just not guaranteed, could be 0.25x could be 100x. Second is asymmetry in information and understanding. 

If everyone already came to the same conclusion there would never be an opportunity for you. It feels difficult at first , it seems once you ""get"" something like Bitcoin you can't believe others havent gotten it yet. But this kind of knowledge takes a long time to permeate.  And you should be glad, because if we are right in our understanding this information asymmetry is providing a once in a generation opportunity for those who ""get it"" first.";27;1;False;46dcvls;ff5fyvu;If Bitcoin Stock-to-Flow shows 100k in the next year....why isn't everyone buying Bitcoin right now?;erpf1q;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/erpf1q/if_bitcoin_stocktoflow_shows_100k_in_the_next/

"One thought,  just because something is scarce and becomes more scarce over time doesn’t mean people actually perceive it as more valuable. One thing stock to flow does not take into consideration is perception, unless more people perceived bitcoin as having value and chose to purchase/hodl/transact with Bitcoin the scarcity argument won’t necessarily hold up. Also, imagine this scenario: say in 2 months some groundbreaking new digital currency algorithms are developed that render bitcoin less useful, that would really skew the value right? (I know it’s unlikely but many things could have this effect on perceived value) If people find an alternative for something the stock to flow falls apart. This is still one type of risk that we have with cryptocurrency. Oil is in the same boat, as alternative energy becomes cheaper/cleaner/more accessible than Oil, the price will decline, even if it’s a scarce and limited resource. Some people even seek out alternative even if they are not as efficient or cheaper, If they perceive its better... (Environment, ease of use, portability, privacy, access, etc..)

Firstly I’d say people generally don’t know about stock to flow let alone how Bitcoin works.

The masses generally aren’t interested in Bitcoin yet.

Those masses probably don’t have much spare income that they’d consider gambling with.

Plus Plan Bs model may not reap those rewards, it’s a case of wait and see.

But when bitcoins were fractions of a dollar you’d have said the same thing if you were originally a believer and could see it finally was something different from what had been before, so you could have said that then and up until this point why aren’t people buying it.

"I noticed this where I live. So then I checked all of the coinstars that I saw in my area. Most of them did NOT offer it. I'm guessing they wanted to test it on X% of machines before they roll it out everywhere. Either that, or some machines lack the functionality needed to process the transaction.

I tested one just to get a feel for the UX. I wasn't impressed. I mean, it's cool that they're in the crypto space at all, but this is what I encountered:
- 8% - 10% fee IIRC
- full KYC including ID scan and account creation
- took over 24 hours from when I deposited cash to be able to access the btc I paid for

Seems like there's a substantial human element involved, my guess is that someone behind the scenes at coinstar has to manually approve each transaction / check against some sort of known ML database.

Also I was disappointed that I couldn't turn in a jar of change and use the proceeds from that to buy btc. Crazy, right? The machine and company that is known for turning in coins wouldn't let me use my coins to buy btc. I would have had to redeem the coins for cash,  (8.9% fee) then feed the cash into the machine and buy the btc with that (another 8-10% fee). By the time all would be said and done, I'd be -19%. Not a good start IMO.

"> I understand it's for my own protection

It has nothing to do with your protection.  It's for ***their*** protection.  US banking transactions are completely reversible, basically forever.  They get the bank transfer the next day.  To cover the risk of charge-backs they carry fraud insurance.  For whatever reason the fraud insurance underwriter told them 10 days was the appropriate amount of time to wait.

Other exchanges use other insurers or self-insure.  Try the big 5 and see which ones work for you.  I've heard that if you use a Debit Card (not Credit) to fund Gemini, CashApp or Coinbase that you can get quicker availability.

I generally don't use Debit Card funding due to the high fees.  I have use FedWire on coinbase and it was instant.  Fees will be $10 + whatever your bank charges.

KYC Exchange Buy/Sell (maker) fees:

* r/Binance - 0.10% + 0.0005 BTC withdraw fee
* r/Kraken - 0.16% + 0.0005 BTC withdraw fee

There are physical locations where there are Bitcoin ATMs and other vending/voucher methods.  For example, in the U.S. there is:

- https://coinatmradar.com  <-- Some will require Identity verification/KYC, others just a phone number (e.g., CoinFlip ATMs, when $900 or less), or nothing at all
- https://www.coinstar.com/bitcoin (with [2,200+ locations in the U.S.](https://coinme.com/kiosks))  <-- Identity verification/KYC
- https://libertyx.com/a/buy/locations  <-- Cashier (cash), and/or Kiosk (debit card)
- https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/dabf2m  <-- Some will require identify verification/KYC, but not all will.

Otherwise, an in-person cash trade or an online trade using a P2P trading exchange may possibly be your next best option:

*P2P Trading exchanges*

- [Person-to-person (P2P) Trading Exchanges](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/dyclf8)
- https://exchangerates.pro  <-- Choose country and/or Payment Method

Using gift cards, there is [CardCoins](https://www.cardcoins.co) for paying with a non-reloadable, prepaid GIFT card (VISA/Mastercard/AMEX/Discover),  [CryptoVoucher.io](https://cryptovoucher.io) for paying with gift cards for numerous brands, [Redeem](https://www.redeeem.com/gift-cards), and [BitOf](https://bitof.io/) for paying with Amazon UK gift cards).


You can purchase online using a No-KYC online store, paying by depositing cash in a bank account or through Moneygram/Western Union:

- [BitQuick QuickBuy](https://www.bitquick.co/quick-buy) [**NO-KYC** (when trx amount is under $400)]

When the block number is 630000, the halving period increases from 2 to 3. The block reward is 50/2^3 = 6.25  

The period between blocks averages 10 minutes if the global hash rate is constant. The mining difficulty is recalculated every 2016 blocks (approx 2 weeks). If the hash rate increases between difficulty recalculation points, then there will be 2016 blocks mined in less than 20160 minutes. If this happens a lot, then block 630000 will arrive sooner than predicted. If the hash rate falls, then block 630000 might arrive later than predicted

"You are trading with something for 3 years now whose fundamentals you do not understand at all! That is noteworthy...

First of all there is no ""they"". ""They"" do not determine the halving date. ""They"" do not exist. Please educate yourself about the open and decentralized nature of Bitcoin!

Secondly, the halving is not defined by a date but by a blockheight, i.e. by a number of blocks mined. Exactly every 210000 blocks a halving occurs! I.e. next time after block nb. 630000.

One block takes 10 min on statistical average in theory if(!) global mining power did not change. However, de-facto it always increases due to a combination of better ASICs and higher prices. This and the fact that difficulty adjustment always lags behind by 2 weeks due to the Bitcoin protocol implies that actual average block interval is rather 9.6 than 10 minutes.

So right now we have block 613779, so 16221 blocks are remaining.

Multiply this with 9.6 min and we get 155722 min or 108 days from now. This brings us to 7th May 2020 for the estimated Bitcoin halving date.";4;1;False;Amichateur;ff4vr77;Halving date;ern113;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ern113/halving_date/

"I have my doubts.  But one thing I thought of today was to use the congressman's need to raise [congressional dues](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7879613/AOC-holds-250K-dues-Democrats-says-wont-pay-people-like-not-welcome.html) to our favor.  My plan is basically to donate BTC to your congressman.  Works something like this.

1. Find your [congressman](https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative)
2. Ensure your registered to vote since congressmen will pay more attention to a registered voter than an unregistered voter.
3. Join the political party of your congressman.  You don't have to vote party ticket, but party rolls are public record.  Your congressman will pay more attention to a registered voter in their party than one in an opposing party.
4. Use google to find their campaign page, not their Congressional page.  The two are different.
5. Make a $10 donation through their campaign page and record all the answers you gave in the questionnaire.  Be truthful.  Donations are public record and a politician will pay a lot more attention to a donor than a non-donor.
6. Find the mailing address for correspondence off of the campaign web-page for the congressman.
7. [Make a paper wallet](https://github.com/pointbiz/bitaddress.org) depositing $10 in BTC to it.  Ensure you ***KEEP THE PRIVATE KEY***.
8. Write a letter to the congressman making ***NO*** political position, only requesting that they accept your small campaign contribution.  Include in your letter all the questions and answers you filed away in [5] as well as the paper wallet.  Provide some basic instructions for sweeping a paper wallet and mention that the wallet will be void after 12 months.
9. Use the congressman's House.gov website (not the campaign website) to request a meeting with the congressman or his staff.  Yes, they do this, its their job.  Tell them you would like to discuss ""Virtual Currency Tax Fairness Act of 2020"" sponsored by congresswoman Suzan DelBene of Washington's 1st District.
10. You will likely meet with a staff member, don't be offended.  Simply make your case to them and also provide your arguments in written form.  Some offices may require you transcribe the message onto their letterhead.  Don't be offended, just do it.
11. Check the address in the paper wallet every month or so to see if the funds have moved.  If they do move send a letter, tweet or call to the congressman's campaign thanking them for accepting your bitcoin donation.
12. If the funds don't move for 12 months, sweep them back to your wallet and send a letter, tweet, or call to the campaign informing them that the wallet had expired and offer to make them another.  They will decline.

Done.  You've done your bit and it only cost you $10 to $20 and a shit-ton of time.  The above really kinda works for any interaction you want to have with the government.  I've used it before and it helped quite a bit.

">I figure it's much better to spend bitcoin than to cash out and pay the taxman

You are committing tax fraud.

Lets say;

- You buy 1 BTC for $5000 AUD

- Then when BTC is worth $10000 AUD, you spent 0.5 BTC to buy a $5000 AUD guitar

- You got that 0.5 BTC for $2500 and unloaded it when it was worth $5000

- This creates a taxable event of $2500 profit

It doesn't matter if you trade your BTC for a guitar, ETH, XRP, a block of gold, sex, bananas from Coles, or fiat (AUD).

It's all the same, you bought an asset (BTC), and then got rid of the asset (BTC). It's a taxable event, and you have a profit or loss from it.

A couple important points:

Actually just the beginning of the story. You are credited with owning something, you actually have no control over it whatsoever. Being that the whole purpose of bitcoin is to have a self sovereign form of money that cannot be confiscated and that you 100% verify and control yourself, Robinhood's custodial form of ownership is as far from actual bitcoin as they come. Robinhood owns the bitcoin, they have the keys, they have the control, they can buy and sell it, move it around... basically they just say in their database that you are entitled to the $USD equivalent of your holdings. If you own it, ask Robinhood to send it to a certain address for you, ask to withdraw to your own wallet, ask for the keys to that bitcoin, you will get nothing. How can you technically own something that you have absolutely no control over whatsoever? Bitcoin is not a stock, it's not something a bank controls for you, you are just so wrong on so many levels. You might own something, but it certainly is not bitcoin that you own. You own an IOU of fiat value. That is the end of the story.;2;1;False;Gr33nHatt3R;ff4m5rt;Where can I buy $10 in bitcoin?;erklfw;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/erklfw/where_can_i_buy_10_in_bitcoin/

"Eh. Maybe that's good enough for some people. I think you will find a much higher than average number of people here who prefer actual control over ""legally technical ownership"". Just my observation from spending a few years around r/bitcoin. To be clear, I don't think there's any issue with keeping small amounts in there--I mainly use RH for stocks but keep my small leftover balance in bitcoin instead of USD--but again you're putting a ton of trust that Robinhood has excellent security (likely) and insurance (also likely, but I still worry about the lack of details on their site), and also won't suffer a wide-scale breach that forces them into bankruptcy (low likelihood, but not impossible). Counterparty risk is real and worth mentioning.

"Well that's a fucking straight lie. Robinhood uses ""strict operational security"", which is a combo of hot and cold asset storages.

"You must've missed the part where I said ""Robinhood owns the bitcoin, they have the keys, they have the control"", I am well aware that Robinhood holds the bitcoin securely for you. You don't actually have the bitcoin though, Robinhood does. Bitcoin is immutable & censorship resistant. Right now Robinhood can censor you and tell you what you can and can't do with that bitcoin. They are custodial and you have no right to the bitcoin whatsoever. All you have the right to do is to buy or sell from/into fiat. You never actually own any bitcoin. They hold plenty of bitcoin I am sure, you hold none. You hold a ticket in a database to convert in and out of fiat, that is not bitcoin. Bitcoin is a means of being financially self sovereign and you have nothing remotely close with Robinhood. Of course you are free to speculate on the price while somebody else owns the bitcoin for you, but even if they lost ""your"" bitcoin, the insurance will return fiat to you. You will never actually see any bitcoin under any circumstance. If they get robbed or shut down, no bitcoin for you, only fiat.

"Debt doesn't necessarily have to be a bad thing, though.

Let me ask you this question. Would you rather pay $2,000 a month in rent for your entire life and be ""debt free"", or would you rather take on a $240,000 loan on a $300,000 house with 20% down payment, 30 year mortgage, and then after a 30 year period. At a 4% interest rate (which is quite high right now), you'd be looking at paying $545,000 including interest, property taxes, home insurance, HOA fees, etc...for 30 years. And then after that you would be able to live only on property taxes and insurance which would run you about $300 a month.

So over a 45 year period, you would be paying $599,000 to live in a very nice house, with your own rules, that could still be re-sold most likely at LEAST at break even point to the original price, probably more likely to gain 1% or so on inflation per year. 

That would cost you $1109 a month in total over a 45 year period. Whereas with renting, over a 45 year period (by the way, rent prices tend to go up, so this is actually best case scenario, assuming that rent prices stay the same), you would be paying $2,000 a month = $1,080,000

So in other words...After a 45 year period, with buying a mortgage, despite paying almost 70% in interest on your house, you'd have an asset worth $300,000 (worst case scenario the house is only sellable after 30 years of inflation for what you paid for it) as well as having paid, in total, $600,000. While renting you would have paid $1,080,000 and would continue to have to pay $2,000 a month in rent, and would own nothing.

No the mortgage loan is considered a liability. The house itself is an asset. You need to work on your financial literacy. And no, renting is terrible. When you rent you are throwing money away. You can pay rent and get nothing or pay your mortgage and pay yourself towards your own equity. I’m getting my masters in finance currently. The reason people rent is because they can’t afford a down payment for the house. But if you have the cash for a down payment then owning is 100% better because your mortgage goes toward your own equity. You just need to find the right property and get a good interest rate.;7;2;False;Grizzzlybearzz;ff4supd;Who else lives like me?;erj4ff;https://i.redd.it/5uyptx82uzb41.jpg

I can imagine not having yet found what you enjoy.

I don’t support the socioeconomic norm nor do I pretend to find beauty in the calamity that ensues from our capatilist wet dream.

I want to automate menial labor so education standards can be raised and a new flood of engineers, artists and scientists can come about and create a better future with everyone unborn held in regard.
In my free time before I work I read/write music and record and manage my machines for my hobby mining and push to become better at coding all because I can’t imagine not being busy.

Sad, surely in your eyes, but I like to think I’m pushing towards something because even through that I keep going to school.

I understand you might have a utopian post-work vision, but that doesn't invalidate the fact that work does create a sense of purpose in many people's lives, even if it is not the *main* purpose. /u/ToshiBoi might not even be talking about *career* work, but maybe simply about staying occupied.

First assumption is that you're a do-it-yourselfer. Am I wrong?

Second is you have access to the internet...clearly evident.

Third is you don't have a face that causes women and children to flee...you have said you have a girl friend. That's a huge plus that many don't have. Accept support wherever you find it in life.

I'll bet you can make enough in your own small town to attain the money to buy the tools you need and the truck to carry them and yourself to greener pastures and a more fulfilling life. If your girlfriend supports you in your efforts you are a very lucky man.

By tapping your phone to the art work you can see the balance of each card, see the public address for each card, and move money (bitcoin) from a card.

If there is a balance on one of the cards you can extract the value to a cryptocurrency wallet that you control. Each card has a microchip on it that holds the private key.

"I work in IT. So from a technical perspective, the only reason you'd want to use a blockchain is if your priority is decentralization (not to be confused with a federalized model, where there is distributed control to a few parties), and on top of that most 'blockchains' are not sufficiently decentralized even though they claim to be. Bitcoin is not decentralized just because it uses a blockchain, it's decentralized because of the miners, the distribution, the hashrate, the entire ecosystem. Chances are, if you need decentralization, lets say for supply chains as you mention, you'll either peg to the bitcoin blockchain (see Open Timestamps), or use a federated side chain like liquid. You do not need to create a new blockchain and its stupid expensive.

Think about it from an engineering perspective. Maybe blockchain introduced some cool concepts from a business perspective which is totally valid, but when you actually go engineer a system you probably don't need it, or best case is you use bitcoin because it is the most secure blockchain. In other words, you could either spend a shit ton of time and energy trying to build and *maintain* a decentralized blockchain ecosystem, OR you can make use of one that exists. And why wouldn't you use the most secure best blockchain available? If your blockchain is not sufficiently decentralized then it's just a database (IBM Hyperledger). That's why this blockchain hype is a bit of a mirage.

My guess is, when it comes down to it, 99% of projects that actually need some sort of decentralization will use federated side chains like liquid. You get some semblance of time-stamping and consensus building, but the federation is still in control.

And as a side note, you could argue to use ethereum over bitcoin, but I think there are just so many systematic issues with ethereum it would be very risky to build anything on it, if you're looking at it from a systems engineering standpoint.

Edit: Just to clarify, I'm sure blockchains are being built and deployed and will continue to be bought into for the next while, but what I'm trying to say is in truth they're inefficient, and probably the wrong way to do things, which happens all the time.

"> Segwit uses accounting tricks

It's not an ""accounting trick"".  That makes it seems like it's all smoke and mirrors, with no actual benefit.  In reality, the use of segwit allows more txs to fit in each block.

Previously, blocks were limited to 1mb, but now because of segwit, blocks are routinely ~1.3 - 1.4mb.  That's a roughly 30-40% throughput increase.  And this is only at 50-60% segwit usage.  If we get to >90% usage, blocks should routinely be about 1.7 - 1.8mb.

> This doesn't mean that blocks are more efficiently filled.

Yes, it absolutely does.  It is more efficient from a throughput point of view.  The more segwit txs that are in each block, the more densely packed blocks can be.  He used the word ""efficiently"" exactly as defined.

> In fact if you count the bytes that a block uses Segwit transactions take up more space than regular non-Segwit transactions.

Yes, because more txs were packed into the block.  Of course that's going to require more bytes.

Except that we wouldn't have needed the 1 MB limit in the first place if it wouldn't have been for a vocal minority that claims that Bitcoin blocks need to be limited in size. Satoshi's original design always intended to scale the block size with usage:

> The current system where every user is a network node is not the intended configuration for large scale. That would be like every Usenet user runs their own NNTP server. The design supports letting users just be users. The more burden it is to run a node, the fewer nodes there will be. Those few nodes will be big server farms. The rest will be client nodes that only do transactions and don't generate.

The think about Segwit is that it not only uses account tricks to put more transactions into a block, it is also pretty bad at it. If you have the same set of transactions as (i) regular transactions and (ii) Segwit transactions you will be able to fit more transactions into a block due to the arbitrary 1 MB limitation. But assuming that this limitation would not exist (or that the transactions don't reach the block size limit) then the Segwit transactions would take up more space (when counted as bytes) then the regular transactions.

The only ""vocal minority"" I see are the losers who lost 90% of their bitcoin denominated holdings by buying BCH.

The blockchain split. Everyone who supported big blocks went to BCH. Bitcoin retained more than 95% of the value. BCH can't even hold 5%. You're absolutely crazy if you think only a ""vocal minority"" agreed with segwit. If there was support for big blocks, BCH would have won the vast majority of the market share.


>Satoshi's original design always intended to scale the block size with usage

""Original design"".. Lol, you sound like Craig Wright.  The reality of the situation is that Satoshi put the 1mb limit in place himself. You don't seem to understand that breaking a protocol rule requires nearly unanimous consensus. No developer is obligated to code up someone else's proposal. If you want large blocks on Bitcoin, then you code it up and see if it gains consensus. But this was tried multiple times with BitcoinUnlimited, BitcoinXT, and even Segwit2x. Guess what happened? Each and every time the proposal was defeated.



> The current system where every user is a network node is not the intended configuration for large scale.

He referred to miners as ""nodes"" back then. He was simply explaining that everyone wasn't going to mine. But he absolutely did expect everyone actually run the Bitcoin client. That's the only way the network remains decentralized.

That's a generalization that's not true in many cases. Me and a lot of other early adopters who support big blocks didn't sell on any side of the forks. First, because I prefer an index-style investment in case my predictions are wrong. Second, because I don't like paying taxes which I can (legally) avoid as long as I hodl.

This is nonsense.  You're tying to blame the $29k bubble popping on fees?  The vast, vast majority of people who were buying never knew what a fee was.  They were just opening up Coinbase accounts and buying Bitcoin.  It was a speculative bubble.  It was never sustainable.  This is how Bitcoin grows, in cyclical bubbles.  Years of very slow increases, building up to a massive bubble setting a new all time high, then popping back down, but always ending up higher than the previous all time high.

But once people show up and say ""I don't use BTC for small transfers anymore, instead I use <random altcoin>"" they are ""instructed"" that said altcoin is a scam and that they should use BTC instead. You can't have it both ways.

Small value txs and even micro-txs will be done on Lightning, not some centralized worthless altcoin.  And let's be clear, even BCH's fees are too high for a micropayment network.

It’s trying to indicate the emotion of the market. Generally times when people are greedy are when you should hold/sell and in fearful times you buy.

"I have my doubts.  But one thing I thought of today was to use the congressman's need to raise [congressional dues](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7879613/AOC-holds-250K-dues-Democrats-says-wont-pay-people-like-not-welcome.html) to our favor.  My plan is basically to donate BTC to your congressman.  Works something like this.

1. Find your [congressman](https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative)
2. Ensure your registered to vote since congressmen will pay more attention to a registered voter than an unregistered voter.
3. Join the political party of your congressman.  You don't have to vote party ticket, but party rolls are public record.  Your congressman will pay more attention to a registered voter in their party than one in an opposing party.
4. Use google to find their campaign page, not their Congressional page.  The two are different.
5. Make a $10 donation through their campaign page and record all the answers you gave in the questionnaire.  Be truthful.  Donations are public record and a politician will pay a lot more attention to a donor than a non-donor.
6. Find the mailing address for correspondence off of the campaign web-page for the congressman.
7. [Make a paper wallet](https://github.com/pointbiz/bitaddress.org) depositing $10 in BTC to it.  Ensure you ***KEEP THE PRIVATE KEY***.
8. Write a letter to the congressman making ***NO*** political position, only requesting that they accept your small campaign contribution.  Include in your letter all the questions and answers you filed away in [5] as well as the paper wallet.  Provide some basic instructions for sweeping a paper wallet and mention that the wallet will be void after 12 months.
9. Use the congressman's House.gov website (not the campaign website) to request a meeting with the congressman or his staff.  Yes, they do this, its their job.  Tell them you would like to discuss ""Virtual Currency Tax Fairness Act of 2020"" sponsored by congresswoman Suzan DelBene of Washington's 1st District.
10. You will likely meet with a staff member, don't be offended.  Simply make your case to them and also provide your arguments in written form.  Some offices may require you transcribe the message onto their letterhead.  Don't be offended, just do it.
11. Check the address in the paper wallet every month or so to see if the funds have moved.  If they do move send a letter, tweet or call to the congressman's campaign thanking them for accepting your bitcoin donation.
12. If the funds don't move for 12 months, sweep them back to your wallet and send a letter, tweet, or call to the campaign informing them that the wallet had expired and offer to make them another.  They will decline.

Done.  You've done your bit and it only cost you $10 to $20 and a shit-ton of time.  The above really kinda works for any interaction you want to have with the government.  I've used it before and it helped quite a bit.

"> How bout USA Puerto Rico Territory.... isn’t it all free of capital gains?

Uh, no. Not exactly.

First of all, it's a myth that Puerto Rico does not have an income or capital gains tax. While citizens of Puerto Rico can not be taxed by the US Federal government, they can by the Puerto Rican government, and they are. And it's similar to the United States. The only people in Puerto Rico who don't pay capital gains taxes are the very small numbers of people who apply for and meet the very specific requirements of an Act 60 decree (formerly known as act 22 pre-2020), which exempts them from the Puerto Rican capital gains taxes, along with other benefits.

Among the many requirements to qualify for an Act 60 decree, are a yearly $10,000 donation, property ownership, and primary residence in Puerto Rico. People who resided in Puerto Rico at any time between 1997 through 2012 are not even eligible (so basically, all native Puerto Ricans).";2;1;False;333929;ff4rfe7;Proposed bill in US House of Representatives to allow any personal transaction to be excluded from capital gains tax as long as **PROFIT** is less than $200.

The point was to explain why Schiff prefers gold over Bitcoin. Gold is undeniably more tangibly useful than Bitcoin or any other bootstrapped currency. It became the preferred metal for jewelry and ornamentation because it has luster, doesn’t tarnish or rust, is easily malleable, and can be melted down at a reasonable temperature. Copper, iron, and bronze were all used too, but they fall short in at least one of those characteristics.;1;0;False;UrbanIsACommunist;ff6hfeo;Poor Peter;er398h;https://i.redd.it/jbp6i1ak7tb41.jpg

"I didn't say I wanted to destroy all government. I just want to take away it's ability to coerce the people for funding and existence. They should compete with private corporations in everything they do which is only possible with the option not to pay for or use the municipal option.

If there are things that are not possible to do well enough, in a free market, then those things should be government responsibilities. I happen to think my local government is as good as it gets, at taking away my trash. I have no reason to seek an alternative garbage disposal solution.

Edit: People should be free to organize, either politically or economically, to accomplish shared goals. Governments are good at getting things done that don't seem economical enough for a corporation to invest in it, or that the local people wouldn't trust as a profit driven thing, like prisons. However, using force for any of it is a recipe for bad results. Using the law to abolish competition both with Municipal infrastructure, like power and water, or on behalf of Comcast and Verizon is not helping citizens.";1;0;False;acvanzant;ff4kffe;U. S.

There's plenty of volume. I'm in bitcoin for the long term. I don't buy bitcoin when it's low and sell when it's high to make fiat money. I buy bitcoin every so often in little amounts to dollar cost average my buys and hold. If you want to only accumulate bitcoin then bisq is a great way. And volume is increasing every day.

"Yes, all they have to do is enter the recovery phrase into any compatible wallet software program and they will have full access to your entire crypto stash.

Write your old recovery phrase down again, generate a completely new wallet with a completely new phrase, generate addresses in the new one, save those, go back to the old wallet (reenter the old recovery phrase) and move all your crypto to the new addresses.
