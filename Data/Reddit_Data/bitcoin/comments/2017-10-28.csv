"I’ve read those articles, but sadly I’ll need your explanation of how their relatively subtle distinction between literally directly using the precise funds obtained in a specific deposit to make a specific loan somehow utterly invalidates my capsule summary/abstraction of the business model of banks. The third article seems to hint at a peculiar agenda/mindset and I wonder if it is part of what is in play here? Is it anger at “fiat money”? 


As your own articles plainly state, deposits must balance the ledgers. Yes, they can be obtained from other sources, but it’s more expensive and there are regulatory requirements that mandate specific ratios. Those deposits also lead into other services (cross selling) and can generate fee based incomes for services, hence the various promotions used to attract deposits (matching funds, etc). Certainly there are complexities beyond the scope of my capsule summary- we also don’t always loan out all of our funds and can even invest them, but none of those things seem like a profound knock against my basic premise- the primary reason that banks pay dividends and offer services to attract deposits is so they can earn terrific rates of return on those deposits via loans. The accounting used in the process doesnt seem to utterly undermine the analogy to me, but I am certainly eager to see you explain how it does so.";1;1;False;VLANtagonist;dozngy2;Bitcoin is going to do to banks what email did the post office and Amazon did to retail.;78uxpf;https://www.forbes.com/sites/briankelly/2017/10/24/why-bitcoin-matters-more-than-blockchain/?utm_source=followingimmediate&utm_source=TWITTER&utm_medium=email&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=20171023&utm_campaign=sprinklrForbesInvestorTwitter&utm_content=1125431648#5ae2449437ac

"Calling it creation is largely semantics- those deposits still offset loans. That there are other (much less lucrative) methods of securing funds isn’t really relevant to the business model, which is still functionally get deposits by offering interest (better if funds are locked in via certificates of deposit) and services in order to lend at much more favorable rates of return. That’s still very relevant to an article whose central precept is that bitcoin will displace banks just like Amazon destroyed brick and mortar stores (or Uber destroyed cans, since that’s the example of industry disruption that leads every Gartner presentation I’ve ever sat through). As I said, banks aren’t really fundamentally in the business of providing payment processing or cashing checks. That’s not their raison d’etre. Those are inducements to deposit only, and if anything, articles emphasizing the ability to draw cash from the central bank (for a worse profit margin, mind you, and with less cross sell opportunities or fee incomes) only underscore that perspective.

That is about the expected outcome at fee levels, but it depends on the *time of day* you send, and Sundays are the lowest fee days.

Futures show BTC1 is currently trading -17% current BTC price, I'd say that is a huge devaluation. Granted this may close in when things are more certain as of right now it is devaluing bitcoin.

Just because I post negatively about bitcoin does not mean I am not a holder. I just absolutely hate the direction bitcoin is going. Bitcoin should have had increased transactability [YEARS](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-December/011865.html) ago (ctrl+f 4MB). 

It also feels weird they are still referring to it as electronic cash when the fees were down. Don't see that posted anymore. The *bumps in the road* had years to be fixed! 

It is frustrating how slow solutions are to fix this issue, the less transactions being made on bitcoin, the fewer people are buying it which = less money in bitcoin. Imagine a truly liquid bitcoin on <10 cent transaction fees, with larger blocks we honestly could be seeing 7-8k BTC right now (take away portions of ETH and LTC cap). 

Alternatives are popping up taking bitcoins demand away. The 'digital gold' aspect is psychological, It goes against all convention the price rises while transactions are kept pretty much static due to block size limitations. It concerns me seeing the transaction numbers vs price. It would help me sleep at night knowing the [transaction #s match the price](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/marketcap-transactions-btc-eth.html#6m)

I'm 'pumping' Ethereum by pointing out its superiority as [transactional currency] (https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/median_transaction_fee-btc-eth.html#6m), users are moving to [ETH](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/transactions-btc-eth.html#1y) and LTC for making cross exchange transactions and purchases (where accepted) also ETH devcon in 4 days.

Im looking at how i can use this project to set people up with using cryptos in about 15 minutes, then go into the details where they have a choice to see how it works. In research id look at other websites to see what they did for beginners on how to use the system. They all go into the history of how it started, nodes, mining, and how revolutionary it is. People dont care how it works, just like cars, the internet, cellphones, even their own banking system, they just use them. The system isnt hard to use and while  learning about it all can be fun, its not necessary. People will be curious on their own, once they can start using the system they can start asking how it work and other questions. There is really a lack in this department.

"This is the reason me and my country men are using it more and more, our country is in a fucked up situation, we can't access dollars directly we need to use third parties to convert our national currency to dollars in places like paypal or payza, but those places have fucked more than one of us, they closed my account and i don't even know why and i will never see that money again as it only allows me to attach an US bank account after 6 months, but unless i go to the US and open one it is impossible for me to do that.

I'm a freelancer, i used to charge my international clients on paypal, after that i started to use payoneer then they closed my account as well for a contract that was on an ecommerce website for e-cigs, they told me they do not accept transactions that are for tobacco as that is a banned item, such bullshit, i was just charging to build the website! Not buying any tobacco or related items! They removed my billing service, global payment service, and C2C (possibility to send from payoneer account to payoneer account), and only allowed me to withdraw what i already had through their card.

So now i have to do magic for clients that do not want to pay me in bitcoin as they are unsure on whether buying it or not as they haven't ever, i have tried to convince them, tell them how easy it is, offer them a discount, but they do not agree, some clients that already use bitcoin have no trouble using bitcoin, others i have to charge in things like amazon giftcards then trade those for bitcoins, it's a nightmare! And all of that nightmare is due to our countries centralization.

Before if i needed to convert things like payoneer or paypal to my national currency to buy food or anything important i would have to take a -20% in exchange fees. If i had $100, i would only get the $80 equivalent in national, with giftcards to my national currency it is even worse at -75%, now with bitcoin i can sell at localbitcoins at -5% to -10% and for those that earn in national currency and want to buy in they do so easily thanks to localbitcoins, and no risk of their life savings disappearing just because paypal or others decided to close their account. =) ";36;6;False;randomizerdude;dp0e6yg;Hahaha;799zq0;https://i.redd.it/g2w5a8mnkkuz.jpg
