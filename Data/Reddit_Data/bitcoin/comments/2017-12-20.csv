"You should donate to WAMM. They are an incredible non profit based out of Santa Cruz CA. They donate the majority of their funds to a compassion program that gives out high grade medical cannabis oils, tinctures, and flowers to the seriously ill who cannot afford it. I have never once come across a group who are so committed to a mission of giving and healing. 

Here is the description from their website:
“ Founded in 1993, the Wo/Men’s Alliance for Medical Marijuana (WAMM) is the nation’s oldest continuously operating phytotherapies collective, one that still serves as a model of truly compassionate care 24 years later. By focusing on the needs of patients and caregivers, WAMM provides hope and builds community while offering a safe, organic supply of phytotherapies to patients with a doctor’s recommendation for the treatment of terminal and chronic illness.

Described as “the gold standard of medical marijuana” by a federal judge, WAMM was founded by Mike and Valerie Corral, a couple in Santa Cruz, California who first started secretly growing marijuana together in the 1970’s, after Valerie found the then illegal herb effective in helping to control her epileptic seizures. Following a pair of arrests, the Corrals resolved to help others facing similar persecution, and soon local patients started seeking them out.

Since then, what started as a handful of seriously ill patients banding together has grown into a collective membership of more than 2,000 seriously intentioned citizens. Beyond growing and distributing phytotherapies and related products, WAMM also plays a vital role in advocating for the rights of cannabis patients and providers, including by helping pass Proposition 215, California’s medical marijuana law.

In 2002, the Drug Enforcement Agency raided the WAMM garden and destroyed the collective’s entire crop of state-legal phytotherapies. Several members died as a result of being cut off from their supply. In response, less than two weeks after the DEA raid, WAMM gathered on the steps of City Hall, alongside the mayor of Santa Cruz and other local officials, to defiantly distribute free medicine to members.

Next, with support from the ACLU and the City of Santa Cruz, WAMM successfully sued the federal government. The garden was subsequently replanted, and now grows more beautifully than ever.

Today, WAMM membership is open to all California residents with a valid doctor’s recommendation to use medical marijuana. But please note, we do not sell nor buy marijuana. Each member receives according to need and returns to WAMM according to ability. There are no financial or other demands required for participation. We only recover our costs.”

Disclosure: I have friends who are treated by WAMM and have been a supporter of theirs for a very long time.
Do your own research tho and it will reveal itself as the amazing healing organism that it is.

"Yesterday I sat down the executive director of our nonprofit-www.ibmee.org- and explained to her what cryptocurrencies are and why I believe they are the future. I showed her the Pineapple Fund and proceeded to tell her that I believe we have a good chance of being honored with a donation. 

We spent several hours pouring our hearts and souls into filling out the very reasonable application. We could see the possibility for millions, maybe billions, of children to no longer be victims of educational systems (or lack of) designed to make them rule following robots who can't freely think or feel!  

We sent off our application feeling optimistic that we would stand out. Our passion and dedication won't let anything get in our way. We have sacrificed our personal creature comforts, wondering if we will pay rent, afford groceries or be able to fix our cars....we trust and somehow the money shows up. We spend our evenings coaching, on boards and social justice committees, networking, volunteering, and even provide a program pro-bono to a high-risk school. 

When you are giving to a nonprofit, you are betting on the people. I want you to know we are the kind of people you can bet on. As I reflect upon our invitation to donate to i.b.mee. I may have left out the best part...my story that lead me here. 

The Dark before the Dawn-

*I will never forget looking in the mirror and seeing the entire left-hand side of my body limp and unresponsive. I didn't know who I was or what I needed. I felt scared and alone.  I was only eight years old and I was having a stroke in my school's bathroom.*

I look back on this life event as the seed for all my future work. I now realize that my stroke was my brain and bodies cry for massive support and attention. I was shutting down. My whole life my family was stressed to the max and very demanding and I wasn't coping. I felt responsible for everyone and tried to be perfect...even hiding how sick I had become. I was experiencing what many children experience- poor health due to toxic stress or ACES (Adverse Childhood Experiences- google this!!). 

Three weeks later, I found the quote, ""Be the change you want to see in the world,"" It lite a fire within me. I became actively aware that a positive educational experience was necessary for people to climb out of the cycles of disempowerment. Over the next 20 years, I watched my sister and I struggle to cope with school and life. My sister was brilliant but by her sophomore year, she was practically a dropout and definitely a drug addict. I vowed to become an educator and prevent other brilliant kids from giving up on themselves. It was after 8 years of teaching in conventional and innovative school systems that I knew something systemically had to change. We were dumbing our kids down and teachers were struggling to meet the ever increasing demands of standardized testing that was pointless! ENOUGH WAS ENOUGH!

That was in 2014 since then I have helped launch an innovative nonprofit called i.b.mee. With other visionary leaders including a former IBM Coach and business leader, Mark Stamper, and other great minds from all over the world we are creating and research-backed roadmap to learning and growing in the 21st century. We are for education what bitcoin is for the economy...we are a disruption. We are rewriting the rules and educating the troops to co-create a new vision for our children. 

We are working with people all over the world to create the Declaration of Education! 

We have learned more about the brain, trauma, natural learning, motivation, and whole person wellness in the past 25 years then we have in the past 2,500!! 

It is time for a shift! Let me know if you have any more questions or would like to see our research handouts. 

Pine, Please take a few moments to consider my story and view our website: www.ibmee.org.

"<3 this. Pineapples also have another connection that I find really interesting to what you are doing. It is a genius name. Pineapples are a symbol of wealth & hospitality. Your interpretation (Share the deliciousness) gives me goosebumps! I am all in for taking back our symbols (and money/power) and giving them new meanings. 

Your meaning: Something so sweet and nutritious is meant to be shared. YAS!!

Old meaning: 
""The European bastardization of the pineapple symbol, however, meant more than just hospitality—it meant prestige. The richest of the rich bought these fruits, however expensive to show off to other their ability to have them. Since demand relied on the few shipments between the far-off continents, supply would often be scarce. This led to a brand new pineapple rental market taking the European gentry by storm, writes historian Mary V. Thompson. Although, by the 1700s, Europeans started growing them in their own hothouses.

"I heard about this project last week and was blown away at the generosity and the opportunity. I put in an application but wanted to call out what we do here too. I'm not a business development person or a sales person, I am just a program manager who is really passionate about the work we do and believe we could make a huge impact on the communities we reach if only more people knew about us :)

I work for VecnaCares (www.vecnacares.org) a small non-profit based in Cambridge, MA. We work in areas where there is either no or unreliable electricity or cell network and in harsh environments (heat, dust, bugs, rain etc.). All of this combined means that having Electronic Medical Records in these areas is expensive and requires lots of money and expertise to maintain a server. But we've found a solution for this, to get EMR software the last mile to the clinic and the clinicians treating the patients. 

Our solution is the CliniPAK It is basically a server and power management system all in one. 
• Power Management: It can be powered off a solar panel, a car battery or AC power and it can seamlessly switch between them so if  it is rainy for a few days and your solar battery is depleted but you have a car battery plugged it it will automatically switch to the car battery.  
• Server: The CliniPAK creates a LAN (local area network) that allows any wifi enabled device to connect to it. We have deployed OpenMRS, DHIS2, Bahmni and our own EMR software onto the CliniPAK and once its deployed it can be accessed on any web browser. None of the data is stored on the cell phone or tablet it is all stored on the CliniPAK which means that you can have multiple doctors, lab or pharmacy techs or nurses working on the same patient record at the same time and it will instantaneously update. 
• Cell: Our newest model, which we are prototyping and designing now, has a cell modem built in meaning that this data can now be sent over a cell network when its available making the data accessible to people outside the immediate LAN.

Now you may be thinking 'a lot of these places where you're working need medicine and doctors. Why would we focus on getting Electronic Medical Records to them?' That 's a fair question but here are a few benefits of an EMR. 
1) It allows patients to be easily tracked over time. Imagine that you were pregnant two years ago and had a really complicated pregnancy and birth and it was all documented on paper but now you are pregnant again and that paper record is in a room where no one ever looks at them again because they can never find anything. Because you're doctor doesn't know about the issues you experienced during your last birth they can't treat you properly and you and your baby may be at risk for dying. Or if you are a patient with a chronic disease (such as high blood pressure or diabetes) they cannot track you progress. These electronic medical records allow doctor's to know your full medical history and to take all of that into account when they decide on a course of treatment.
2) Having an electronic system makes reporting and and identifying trends so much faster. With the press of a button a person can get a a full report that they need to submit to the Ministry of Health. Easy reporting also allows trends to be identifies much faster and for resources to be deployed to the appropriate areas. Imagine if the first record of from the 2014 Ebola outbreak was recorded electronically instead of on paper. Instead of that record having to go from the clinic to the county health department to the state and then up to the ministry of health to be reviewed it could of be sent directly to the relevant person. In outbreaks such as the Ebola crisis time is everything and knowing where and when cases are occurring as soon as possible is key in preventing the spread. Having an electronic medical record system allows for this to happen. 

We currently work in Kenya, Haiti, Tanzania and Nigeria as well as in one of the largest refugee camps in the world but we want to expand to help organizations that are responding to humanitarian crisis. 

Right now we are small but I truly believe that with this help we could be mighty!! If you've made it to the end of this thank you and thank you for considering us :)";1;0;False;go_abi_go;drjk6tz;I'm donating 5057 BTC to charitable causes!

"Dude, you're something else with anecdotal stories that no one cares about.

Point is dogs are super simple creatures and live life in the moment. What you see is what you get. Shelters encourage adopters to spend time with animals to get to know them before making a choice. Any educated adopter can make an inference to how that animal is as a whole. Dogs don't know to impress anyone. That type of environment means nothing until the dog has had enough.

There is a clear difference between a quiet dog and a dog that is shutting down. People don't adopt dogs that are shut down anyway so it's a non-issue if the dog will be different at home. And those who do already know the dog will be different. That's why there's a push for those dogs to go into a foster home in order to give them a second chance. It's more for the benefit of the dog than the person.

You can opt to purchase a dog if that's your choice. But people buy instead of adopt because of false information on adopting or buying.";1;1;False;;drhzhpk;Sold some bitcoin to buy my new best bud 🤗;7kqq1j;https://i.redd.it/16bgn309ys401.jpg

"You are right. There are a lot ""problematic"" dogs in shelters. That can have a lot of reasons... I should have mentioned  that my post was based on my personal experience I've made with shelters/ organizations in Germany and lots of adopted dogs. My mistake. I can really say I haven't seen any ""sugarcoating"" when describing the dogs. Because of the reason I mentioned above. Those people tying to find a new permanent home for the dogs. They don't make profit from it. The worst thing is if the owner brings back the dog after a few days/ weeks. They mention how the dogs behaves towards humans, children, other dogs, cats etc. Ofc if it's a dog from the streets history is unknown. But then again, they won't set up the dog for adoption without knowing it/ being able to give information about it.

To reduce the chance in getting dogs which might have experienced bad stuff and evoked bad attitude/ behavior you can also adopt puppies.
Concerning health I must say, if you get pure breeds from not certified/ legit breeders, depending on the race, you almost always gonna have problems -> puppy mills.

That wasn't an argument. The mills would be shut down and the impregnating of dogs to be bred for them would stop. The dogs currently in the mill could be sold for low adoption fees by the organization putting an end to mills. Or, the mill would be forced to sell its last set of dogs at their price of choosing. Those specially bred mill dogs would be bought by the public fairy quickly. Then, there would be an end to the mill cycle.

"Are you going to buy all the extra puppies in the world and then personally make sure the breeders slow down their business despite the demand for puppies being greater than ever? No, they'll say ""every single puppy was bought, better make even more to keep up with demand"".

I love animals, but to think all of them can be saved would make me a hypocrite. Look up ""galapagos goat shooting"" and tell me how you would save every animal. You can't. You don't want to kill the goats? Well if you let the goats live, native species die. The correct answer is to kill the goats to preserve biodiversity. It would have been best if humans never introduced goats to begin with, but we can't change that now. It's harsh, but yes, some should die so less will suffer later. 

I don't support the pet trade at all. There are too many irresponsible pet owners out there. Many abandon their pets because they think they're being merciful by releasing them into the wild, or they just don't have the heart to put down the animal when they don't want it anymore so they release the thing. Well, that may be fine for their ex-pet, but it can wreak havoc on native and endangered species. Just look at the boa constrictor problem in florida, or feral cats, which are a huge threat to wild bird populations. What should we do with these harmful animals? Spaying and neutering helps, but it's expensive and it doesn't stop them killing native wildlife until that neutered individual dies. So, should we kill these problem animals for the greater good? Yes, absolutely. Preserving biodiversity and native habitat is way more important than the lives of these cats and other invasive species introduced by humans. 

The pet trade further threatens endangered species by supporting demand for wildlife trafficking. Many parrot species are threatened because people are selfish and just want a colorful bird as a pet, not thinking about how it effects the rest of the world. If you must have a pet, adopt it, and be sure you're prepared to commit to keeping your pet for it's whole life. The only dogs that should be bred are the ones with special jobs, such as police dogs, shepherd's dogs, dogs for the blind, etc.";0;0;False;Tororoi;dris6cy;Sold some bitcoin to buy my new best bud 🤗;7kqq1j;https://i.redd.it/16bgn309ys401.jpg

If BTC market cap hits 2+ trillion USD it will have an inflationary impact on global reserve currencies and will (by necessity) have obtained the status of de-facto standard in enough markets for it to put the incumbents on their heels and affected foundational assumptions about state bank control over global finance and long-term growth in historically rock-solid instruments like US treasuries. Just achieving that scale will become a source for some degree of panic about what is happening to global wealth and power. I personally believe that this will drive even more value into BTC and the USD as the traditional safe-haven. I believe that Japan is already anticipating this sort of shift and is concerned that the Yen may not turn out to be a top pick in this new landscape.

I think the rebalancing point is related to the question of your overall portfolio model. For simplicity, I have three categories of investments: 35% low risk, low volatility, low liquidity (muni bonds, treasuries), 50% in medium risk, medium volatility and highly liquid (cash, equities & real estate) and 15% in highly volatile, high risk alternatives. In this category, I try to keep at least 10 bets, each with a 90% chance of failure and a 14x+ upside if they don't fail. I re-balance every quarter. I actually play BTC in my equities portfolio (bets on the companies that could surge with BTC, either as users or producers) as well as some cloud mining and some buy-low-and-and-hold BTC purchases, all dollar-cost-averaged in and out over a quarterly window to minimize impact from the volatility. Our thesis is a $1T+ USD market cap by Dec 2017.

"Dead right. The odd thing about the disconnect between the real-world problem and the use case that many enthusiasts are fixated on is that it is so pervasive. For someone with no savings BTC is not at all an improvement over what they have today. They only care about transaction fees, convenience and performance at the point-of-sale. For all the hubub about BCH, it is not meaningfully superior to BTC for this case. Despite Satoshi's opening line describing BTC as a ""peer-to-peer version of electronic cash"", it isn't. The market pricing of transaction fees and the compromise of low transaction processing performance in favor of security, scalability and resilience effectively doomed it for the ""electronic cash"" use case.

"I'm saying that there's a lot of magical talk in this thread (and elsewhere) like ""the best thing about bitcoin is THE PEOPLE invested in it"" and ""Once it's spent, there are no unfair rules that funnel wealth back up to the top like in fiat.""

I'm saying that actually, if it's widely adopted, there are **tons** of unfair rules that will funnel this wealth back to the top.

So far the only ways you've found that it will stop the wealth funneling up is lack of printing money (agreed) and being able to illegally hide your wealth from the government (that seems outside scope, since you can do the same thing with gold or whatever).

I'm saying that the other pieces of the system that funnel wealth back up to the top are much, much more powerful (the law, the courts, taxes, bailouts), so your reasoning for how this will help ""the people"" and prevent wealth going up are little drops in the bucket.

It's fine to like BTC, but if it's ever widely adopted it's still going to mostly held by the same 1% as now, since their current cumulative wealth and power to keep the existing legal status-quo is much greater than any in-on-the-first-floor Bitcoin millionaires.

"I really don't think that the transaction cost is that high and even if it were, Bitcoin is still in it's very early stages and I am actually surprised and amazed at how well Bitcoin has done considering that it was the first. I am very hopeful about lightning network and other technological improvements that will help Bitcoin slowly evolve into a mature crytocurrency rather that try and fix all the issues today to reduce transaction fees. 
Now that I think about it why would someone want to use Bitcoin for small transactions? Aren't there hundreds if not thousands of coins that can do micro transaction at negligible cost better than Bitcoin or Bitcoin cash? If I were to be doing a transaction of a hundred thousand dollars, I would be okay paying a hundred dollars in transaction cost. Considering the market cap of Bitcoin, I really do not want those small transactions on Bitcoin network. Interesting comparison would what would be the transaction cost on BCH when it reaches market cap of around $500. Will it still be feasible to have small transactions using BCH??
I hold both Bitcoin and Bitcoin cash and I don't see why both of them cannot coexist in harmony.

"> and will happily scale to that of bitcoin and eth no problem

Untill it *actually scales to that* you should refrain from statements as ""will scale"". You don't know. It *can theroretically scale* to that amount.

You know what? We have a postgres database backing our payment system (nothing crypto, just one of many payment apps out there) that handles approx the BTC amount on busy days. It can theoretically scale to 20x Bitcoin if we scale the PG RDS instance on AWS up to the max. 

This, however, is silly and a stupid comparison. We currently don't need that scale. We probably never will (payments are a side-show of our app). 

I could come in here and say that our BravosChain (the internal name for the payment system) handles x times Bitcoin. 

But I don't. Because it is a) irrelevant, b) untrue, because it can only do so in theory and c) comparing apples and tomatoes.

"There is obviously a spectrum of ""doesn't scale"" though, and Bitcoin is all of the way on the wrong end. Almost every other crypto is better for transactions than Bitcoin, and it's not because btc is handling the most transactions. 

Ether handles more than twice as many transaction last I checked with far lower fees and faster confrimations than btc.

Some ideas like delegated proof of stake or DAG ledgers are taking it even farther. 

If Bitcoin is going to be anything other than digital gold blocks in the long run it needs to at least try to keep up with the rest of distributed ledger tech. 

Otherwise why would I build a business on top of lightning network over Ethereum's upcoming sharding, plasma or raiden, or Iota's flash channels, or basically every other coin that has has more scalability and is working on similar services? If the underlying tech scales better then reattaching the off chain transactions will always be cheaper on other chains.

">Bcash is 'my business needs low fees' and competing against Paypal

...and for the non-rich.

You're talking about 'my business needs low fees'. You're right that a $15 transaction fee isn't convenient for someone who wants to buy coffee, but for some people *it's more money than they make in a month*.

What's the point in challenging our current financial system if only the affluent are able to participate.

BTC needs high fees to be what it is, and we need BTC to be what it is in order for the entire market to function properly. We also need other coins to fill other markets and serve other purposes.

Feelings of loyalty animosity or rivalry should have no place in how you think about economics and markets.

"Consider that you're asking this question in a censored environment, and I might even receive a ban for saying it. :)

The fundamental value of a cryptocurrency, outside of a bubble, is **not** based on nothing. It is based on mathematics. It is determined by how many people want to make transactions using that currency, and what proportion of the currency everyone needs to make those transactions. The currency can't be worth less, but it can sell for more if people stockpile it for some reason.

With BTC, you currently can't make transactions.

"It scales quite a bit.  The issue is that 1mb is an inappropriately low value - BTC is prioritizing the very unimportant time to do a full sync over its core value proposition, which is to act as a decentralized payment network.  8MB or even 100MB+ blocks don't seem to pose any significant risk to centralization, they simply allow more actual transactions to be recorded.  When you start running into issues like blocks being too big for other miners to get before the last block's miner mines a new block, sure, they're too big.  But one block every ten minutes, versus the download time for 8mb?  No way.  That's not even a single second on my home connection.

When you actually hit the limits of that basic, non-invasive, non-protocol-changing scaling method, then it's appropriate to discuss protocol changes to facilitate L2 stuff (assuming the proposals have a good value proposition).  If they're worth the tradeoff before then, sure.  But that's not what's happening.  BTC core is currently incapable of scaling and a simple constant tweak on a fork lets it scale for the foreseeable future, at the oh-so-horrible cost of increasing the amount of storage to record the entire history of transactions for a currency (currently costing, uh, $40, $50 total? What is that, 2-3 transaction fees now?).  And if you want to talk about long, long term scaling - the blockchain increases *infinitely*.  You have to cut off the chain and form a consensus system as to the current UTXO state eventually, with something like btree+DHT for storing the then-unused legacy chain.  I've been describing this like functional reactive programming - replayable transformations T(s1) -> s2 that transform one state into another.  If you know s2 is valid, you don't need to know s1.  Each block is an instance of T, transforming UTXO state.  If there's network consensus on UTXO state at block height h (obtainable through hash + statistical sampling), you can just download that.  Not as strong a security model as everyone being a fully validating node, by a sliver, but that's what scaling is like, you make tradeoffs based on pros and cons.

The really important point to get - the blocks just contain transaction data.  Saying we want to limit the block size to X is just saying, we're only going to allow this many transactions per block (given consistent tx size).  You can't get around that issue.  You can find ways to avoid committing transactions, or merging transactions, stuff like that, but those are just little optimizations - the network is still rate limited.    The unresolved question is, how much do we value having more transactions vs. the technical risks and limitations?  Right now things are grossly imbalanced in favor of limiting transactions.  It has not been shown that 8 or 16 or w/e MB is a risk, there's a multibillion dollar blockchain operating just fine on that premise, but it has been conclusively shown that 1mb right now is causing the equivalent of fee price gouging because of static supply and growing demand for the scarce commodity of space on a block.

"**Hash (food)**

Hash is a dish consisting of diced or chopped meat, potatoes and spices that are mixed together and then cooked either alone or with other ingredients such as onions. The name is derived from the French verb hacher (to chop).

Canned corned beef hash became especially popular in some countries including in Britain and France during and after the Second World War as rationing limited the availability of fresh meat. The dish may also use corned or roast beef.

"Sorry, I can't tell if you're correcting me, agreeing with me, or making an entirely different point than I was trying to make?

Bitcoin is code, yes, but Bitcoin is not about to be forgotten any time soon. 

Bitcoin is deflationary.

By nature, deflationary currencies rise, unless something happens to prevent that. That is why inflationary currencies drop in value over time, like the USD.

Limited supply is really all that's needed to make sure a currency grows in value over time, everything else can change, but if supply is limited it sets the total value of a currency much more effectively than just speculation.

I think a pretty $5k drop right at the time that lots and lots of new people were getting into it is definitely going to set it back a bit.

Hardware wallets and paper wallets are great options for large amounts. For small amounts there are numerous software wallets to choose from on various platforms such as PC or mobile. For PC, I've heard good things about Electrum and Mycelium is a popular mobile wallet (though they don't support SegWit yet). If you want an alternative to Coinbase, Gemini is a common suggestion. I just wouldn't suggest keeping your money on an exchange unless you're trading it, and even then, keep in mind that you're trusting a third party to hold your coins, so if something happens to the exchange, you could lose everything.

"Because the underlying principle of the stock market is ""give me some money for a bit of my business, and if we do well you'll get dividends and a bump in the alpha which means you can then sell your bit of my company for profit.""

Insider trading is taking an investors money and going ""lol, suckers, we'll sell before the bad news and leave our investors fucked (or buy before the good news and lock everyone out of that opportunity too)"" - it's a breach of the moral contract between a business and it's shareholders (and coincidentally the legal one). 

If it were allowed, no one would want to invest in listed companies and market liquidity would dry up faster than a Californian dam. 

Edit: FX isn't quite so clear cut though, since insider trading would technically refer to a central Bank (hmmmm) but certainly exchanges could be accused of insider type fraud if they're front-running trades.";4;1;False;novum_vipera;drio2e5;Coordinated bitcoin dump + network attack with high fees + coinbase adding Bcash...

"I am totally having trouble understanding, so thanks for being patient and taking the time to explain.

First off, my understand of today's events is, there are a handful of individuals that own enough bitcoin to severely impact its price.  They all coordinated and decided to 'dump' a bunch of bitcoin which drove down the price.  I guess my ELI5 version of how I understand all of this is imagine the bitcoin market cap is a body of water and the amount of bitcoin being dumped is a rock.  Right now, the bitcoin market cap is a puddle, so you throw a rock in it and it has a huge impact on the entire body of water.  Twenty years from now, bitcoin could be an ocean and you throw that same rock in it, and it's just a small blip on the radar.  Assuming bitcoin is a success, then hundreds of thousands of people will be involved in bitcoin and using it day to day, so I feel like the more people and more money that are involved in bitcoin, the less power these 'whales' have.

Your concern that it is risky reporting is duly noted.

Couple of things though.  There are hundreds of forks of bitcoin, also airdrops for example did you know that you have byteballs which are being allocated at full moons or somesuch time?  Also, anyone can fork the chain at anytime and sell one new coin to their buddy for 1000$, now not being listed on the exchanges that you frequent, are you going to be filing taxes for income of 1000$ per coins?  The answer is obviously no, you and no one else is because it is essentially impossible to take on that task.  BCH is just popular but it is not even remotely close to the only fork which is granting 'coins' to each btc address holder at the time of it's creation.  Once you sell that BCH or that obscure one of hacker fork, then you will incur income and you would then also have to include the calculated basis price.

""Insider trading is the buying or selling of a security by someone who has access to material nonpublic information about the security.""

Not all insider trading even in the stock world is illegal. Its perfectly legal for say directors of a company to buy shares of their own company despite having insider knowledge. This is still called insider trading however. [Investopedia describes the several legal insider trading situations that happen all the time](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insidertrading.asp)

Yes the term usually implies illegallity, that doesn't mean it universally is used that way.

I agree with you there was no crime here, and this is the price for having an unregulated market. I agree with you on all of that. That said it still is 100% insider trading.

"You might be lost here.  I was initially noting how they substantially increased the price, which then additionally caused people that didn't already hold BCH to buy more of it (whether they agree with the currency or not).

It has nothing to do with adoption, nothing to do with BTC or any other currency's fees.

Dollar amount change *does* matter, because, like it or not, we still represent *buying power* in common currencies, such as USD.  Yeah, in terms of investment, percentage change is more important; but when you're actually looking at cash flow in your accounts and trying to buy stuff then having huge volatility in buying power is absolutely terrible.  This situation works out for people that held from a while back because the S9's value in BCH might be similar to what it was; but it doesn't change the fact that relative to every non-currency asset in the world, the actual price of an S9 has doubled.  Don't forget what currencies actually are: a method of delayed, common-ground, bartering; so you don't have to work for a dairy, get paid in a dozen gallons of milk, then try to trade with everyone else for what you actually need and hope they want milk that day.

Also: I've never told anyone to dump BCH.

"I'm happy to discuss this, though I don't think we agree on all points.

SegWit was implemented as a soft-fork (opt-in functionality, coexists with the current chain) while Bitcoin Cash was implemented as a Hard Fork (mutually exclusive, all-or-nothing change).  Your argument that SegWit has not had sufficient penetration is also applicable to Bitcoin Cash (big blocks = better scalability and lower fees) because people still need to begin accepting the hard-fork as the ""one true fork"" and abandon the old blockchain.  Bitcoin Cash, or any other hard-fork, has the same adoption requirements that something like SegWit does, and this is reflected in its adoption rate as well (Bitcoin Cash has next to no tx volume compared to Bitcoin - it's blocks rarely go above 1MB even though they support up to 8MB).  Just like with SegWit, a hard fork requires Vendor adoption - they must acknowledge it as the ""one true coin"" and abandon the other.  The big difference, is that a soft-fork such as SegWit is backwards compatible, so people who choose not to adopt it can still transact with those who do adopt it, while this is not possible with a hard-fork.

In terms of decentralization, it applies to much more than just countries and/or governments, but to any trusted party.  I rely on Banks and other institutions to store my value and personal information securely.  We've seen multiple times this year alone how that security has been breached and put people's value or identity at risk.  Decentralization helps protect against that just as much as it helps protect against Big Brother.  Central Hubs in the LN are not the same because those Hubs lack authoritative control over the network, and if one Hub goes down or engages in dishonest activity, the system just reroutes around the hub with minimal disruption (assuming LN works as advertised).  

This is an excellent video about why a Layer 2 solution (such as, but not necessarily, LN) are the best long-term approach, and why Layer 1 (on-chain) solutions have undesirable trade-offs.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AecPrwqjbGw

I recognize that this post has somewhat derailed into a discussion on scalability, but at the heart of this, I believe this is what we are trying to wrap our heads around.  Bitcoin promised a lot of things to a lot of people (mostly instant, low-fee tx) and it's true that it's not there yet.  Most cryptocurrencies are not, even the ones that claim they are.  In terms of technical development, Bitcoin, and indeed Blockchain Tech in general, is still very much in its infancy.  If this were a video game, it would be barely ready for it's Technical Alpha / Early Access stage.  However, media hype and word of mouth has put it in the hands of many more people than it was ready for.  Just because that happened does not mean we take shortcuts.  We are trying to change the way the world views value, and that must be done gradually - even if there are bumps along the road.";3;1;False;enigmapulse;drj4jhj;Coordinated bitcoin dump + network attack with high fees + coinbase adding Bcash...

The negative of insider trading isn’t really about moving the price. The problem is that it’s an imperfection in the market.

No, I think you missed my point, centralization is not the problem, it's corruption. Any scaling solution will lead to some form of centralization because it's practically required for the scale of a global currency. It's possible to be centralized but not able to be corrupted because the underlying protocol is sound and voted on by people with consensus mechanisms. LN is over top of bitcoin and outside of it's rules, no consensus, this means it's easily corrupted. It allows LN's final form to be no different than the crappy fiat system we have now.

"Thank you for your reply.  First up, please don't take any of my responses personally.  I like to have a good exchange on this topic since it's not often discussed as openly as it should be (without heated emotions getting in the way).

Regarding the vendor support: If Lightning requires this, then surely we already know the future since Segwit has apparently not penetrated to any effect.  This seems to negate the argument of the Game Theory working in favor of BTC because 1) people have small sums of coins on legacy addresses that they cannot move due to high fees  (which I believe is the case) and 2) When users finally manage to incur the expense of ""unlocking"" their coins, they are likely to move their wealth into another stable crypto-currency with lower fees and more fluid (of which there are at least 2 which would fit this bill).  This essentially means that Bitcoin is left with the few of the few users who are holding the coin as a store of value.  I don't feel like this sort of a Bitcoin has lived up to it's promise and it's certainly not the one that I would be using over the next x months of I had the choice. 

You also mention decentralization. If you think about why this was a desirable attribute, it was so no country could ban or curtail Bitcoin's use.  Over some 8 years we have established that if there is any regulation, it will come in the form of laws (such as KYC or outright bans) rather than some attack on the network (blocking IP's, etc).  So from this perspective, almost all other altcoins are subject to the same restrictions of BTC, regardless of how ""decentralized"" the architecture is (and of course, some argue that LN is more centralized since you can start taking specific hubs offline).  So, if there ever was a reason to go to such lengths to ""decentralize"" at the expense of usability, I feel this was a real poor use of time.  

The development team, to me, just don't seem to get that they are losing traction as a universal payment method.

"> Why do you think lightning is centralized?  
  
Game theory. Sure, anyone can run a node. The problem is that People and businesses are only going to want to open as few channels as possible with highly connected nodes (hubs) to avoid excessive fees and the hassle of managing thousands of channels. There is also the problem of preferring to connect to nodes with high balances to avoid rejected payments due to lack of funds.  
  
Walmart will have a node but it will only open a channel with a bank level node because it's far simpler to route all customer purchases though one or two common payment providers than millions of customers. Since all the customers of Walmart will have to hop through this bank level node to get to Walmart anyways, the customers will also open channels with this node because no one wants to pay higher fees if they don't have to. Other businesses see that this hub has 1000's of users and partnered with Walmart so they will open up channels with just this hub as well.  
  
The system will naturally centralize itself over time because that's the most efficient form of network architecture. Bitcoin is decentralized, this is not efficient, LN will be more efficient because it's centralized. Now That's not really a problem until you think that the LN is completely separate of bitcoin protocol and can be modified at will without a fork consensus. LN could be modified to a fractional reserve lending situation between hubs without bitcoin being able to do shit about it as long as the final closing works out. That's why the real purpose of segwit was never to increase transaction throughput, it simply enables the LN.

"Thank you for the article, but it is still extremely high-level and doesn't answer some of the main questions I have: 1) Does it require vendor support before it can be used (much like Segwit) and, if so, which vendors are onboard and 2) How does LN propose to commit information into a block when it is already completely full, or is the assumption that people will (somehow) immediately convert to LN when it is released?  This doesn't make sense to me as I expect that adoption (if any) would take months to materialize in the form of alleviating the congested blocks. 

While the technology itself might be interesting, the roadmap of execution is not clear.  The project team need to understand that this isn't just about technology.  It's about getting large interests involved so it doesn't end up poorly utilized like Segwit.

"Let me take a crack at answering some of these.

1) Yes, it does require vendor support.  It's not just a switch than can be flipped, there will be a transitory rollout period.
2) It does so the same way we use SegWit tx today.  Opening and closing a channel on the LN is a transaction on the blockchain.  The idea is that instead of an individual making 50 tx over a month then instead make just 2 tx (opening and closing) and then their 50 tx happen on LN (off chain) instead of directly on the blockchain.

The idea of making things like SegWit and LN ""optional"" is to enable a transitory rollout, and not force full adoption all in the same instant (hard-fork).  These technologies offer incentives (lower fees, better features) that encourage use and the network relies on Game Theory (people act in their own best interests) to encourage adoption.

Bitcoin is decentralized, and part of being decentralized means there is not (and should not) be some controlling authority which says ""you must do this in this specific way.""

"Ok, I see the problem. What you are describing is not insider trading.

Insider trading is using information about your companies future activities, which the public is unaware of, in order to make a profit.

"I guess what he is trying to say is that insider trading has nothing to do with price whereas what you're describing is price manipulation. In insider trading, they use information that is not publicly known to give an edge to them. 

For example, suppose you are an accountant working in a big corporate and you get your hands on the upcoming finiancial report that will be published in a week. You notice that there is a 30% boost in revenue and earning so you contact your friend or relative to buy the company's stocks and hold it until the information is released and the stock price will rise. 

In this sense, insider trading doesn't rely on price cause it can be done at any price and still gain profits.

Personally, I agree with your idea about price manipulation and I think that this happens almost in every market. In stock markets, at least, when the fish come in, the price will change even if they don't intend to do so. What I've heard and I believe is true is that market manioulation is real and the degree of which it's applied is dependent on the market cap. And they don't usually do this alone. Big selling or buying can change the technical patterns and lure in technical traders to behave in a way that they predict.

It's harder to force the price up/down using money, but if you have knowledge of something that would significantly impact the price (for example, some change in regulation by a large national government), it would still be easy to profit off of that.

"Bitcoin is about a decade old.  It is not in its infancy.  It is mature, and struggling with age related issues. 

In this case, whale would be anyone holding a large percentage of the active coins at any given time. 

In 20 years, there will be roughly the same number of coins in circulation as today.

Today, there are about 16.75m coins in circulation.  Roughly 1800 per day are minted right now, but that halves periodically.

The maximum number of bitcoins will be 21m in the year 2140, which is about 30% more than today, minus burnt and lost coins.

Someone holding 30% of bitcoins now, holding to 2140, woukd still have 25% of the coins.

It’s like when people think you could sell all of the stock for all of the companies and give the cash to the workers.  You cannot, because the value is in the holding, not the selling.

"> Hornung v. Commissioner, 47 T.C. 428 (1967) and Commissioner v. Glenshaw Glass Co as codified in 26 CFR 1.451-2

thanks for the info,

You realize not all accountants are in agreement.  In any case, you and I can argue, but it won't change what the IRS will do.

In my opinion, which I am standing by, and any IRS audit will do nothing.

The BCH is not a dividend, it is the product of an asset which has not been sold yet.  The cost basis I will use is to subtract it out from the basis I paid for BTC.

I am not going to bullshit and act like money was created out of thin air.  If I buy 1 BTC for 100$ and get 1 BCH later, and then sell.

My cost basis is 100$ and I will spread it to BTC and BCH at the ratio of the coins at the date of Aug 1.

So selling BTC at 200$ and BCH at 50$, yields me 150$ profit, and that ratio is just there for which one has which basis.

That is solid, I'll be putting my papers where my mouth is on that one.

That BCH value came out of BTC, BTC would be worth more if it were not for BCH diluting it.";2;1;False;easypak-100;dricpwe;Coordinated bitcoin dump + network attack with high fees + coinbase adding Bcash...

"I understand where you're coming from, and I was on increasing block-size to at least 2 MB camp like 6 months ago. I did a lot of research and watched videos and now from what I know I don't think its smart to increase block size at all. Increasing block-size will preclude a lot of people from running nodes and will centralize bitcoin a little more, and increasing block size will only increase the transactions capacity by twice as much; which is nothing. With exponential increase in bitcoin adoption the increase in blocksize also needs to be exponential, which is not a feasible solution.  

Now, if we increase number of transactions off-chain with a completely new protocol, then those increases can be exponential, LN is a great example because it literally can add exponentially greater number of transactions to the network. There will be other discoveries/inventions as well as we go along. But increasing block-size, even to 2MB is not justified at all.

"“Time to sell out” implies you don’t really understand crypto currency and the point of bitcoin. 

I saw in another comment you said bitcoin will crash and burn. So why would say get back in but say it will crash and burn.

When people like you and the media tell people who don’t understand bitcoin “it makes you a lot of money but nothing is backing it so IF it crashes there is no safety net.” Where is the implication of it crashing? Besides the people who print more money when they need it creating hyper inflation telling you that it will crash. And then in turn you telling people that it will crash. Creating a fear in the people who are interested but don’t understand it.

"The problem with the 'insider trading' argument is that it assumes that it's obvious in advance whether the price would go up or down. 

Just because we see what the price has done does not mean it could be easily correctly called in advance. After all, many here predicted that once Coinbase opened its stores that the other coin would drop in price massively from people selling it.

They could just as easily have traded on the expectation of a falling price by shorting the coin.

You and your tax advisor are entitled to their opinion. It is my opinion that this is a high-risk reporting strategy based on Commissioner v. Glenshaw Glass Co., 348 U.S. 426 (1955). I generally don't think arguing against fairly clear supreme court rulings is a good idea. I think you should get it in writing that your tax preparer thinks this is the right way to go and his legal basis. This will protect you from future penalties should the IRS go after you. This will protect you if there is an issue down the road. I think the risk of your strategy is dramatically lower if you had control your keys on the fork date. 27k in ordinary income being incorrectly reported isn't enough to necessarily get the IRS's attention. If you are part of the Coinbase distribution, 300k is.

"> ""Insider trading"" is a term that most investors have heard and usually associate with illegal conduct. But the term actually includes both legal and illegal conduct. The legal version is when corporate insiders—officers, directors, and employees—buy and sell stock in their own companies. When corporate insiders trade in their own securities, they must report their trades to the SEC. 

Legal definition from sec.gov

Like I said, it doesn't matter what you think insider trading should be. We have laws that outline what insider trading is and courts and judges and all sorts of judical process for making that determination.

"> The ""asset"" here is a block within a Blockchain.

I point out that the asset is a block in *A* blockchain, not necessarily the Bitcoin blockchain.

> But that is not truly scarce since you can clone Bitcoin (or create another altcoin) and then you have more blocks available.

True, you can clone a blockchain, but that doesn't draw wealth away from the original by default. Anyone running a full Bitcoin node has a clone of the blockchain on their computer that they use to further diversify the Bitcoin network, further securing the original blockchain. No extra blocks are generated. To generate entirely new wealth, you need a new blockchain, ie: a new currency.

> The blockspace asset is not limited.

It is within a project, and that's all it needs. There is a limited number of Bitcoin...forking Bitcoin does not add to the total number of Bitcoin that can be generated. The only thing you can do is change your forked chain slightly so it takes advantage of Bitcoin's progress to date, then build on that progress...but you're still heading in a different direction from Bitcoin, so Bitcoin is not affected by your fork. It's quite literally like a fork in the road...follow one path, you can't follow another unless you have a second body/coin/currency.

If Bitcoin has a limited supply, it is deflationary. This will not change due to any kind of fork, unless the community at large agrees to make the change. Community consensus.

"Oh don’t worry, it will dip more. I know I’ll get downvotes for saying this but Bitcoin, B Core, B Cash or whatever you want to call it is broken.  The utility of it has been destroyed. 

For example, let’s say I give you....

 $200 worth of bitcoin. Once claimed post fees you will receive approximately $10 worth of bitcoin. Why? Full blocks and high fees. 

$400 worth bitcoin cash. Once claimed post fees you would receive approximately $399.98 worth of bitcoin cash. 

Fees will vary depending on your wallet/service, but you get the point. 

Now....

Every successful store in value often has more than one use case.  What do I mean by this? Simply put....

A home is a great store in value. It’s also great for living in! 

Gold is a great store in value. It’s also great for dental fillings or wearing jewelry. 

The more every day use cases the better.

"No they are that high. Just did a test to compare the two coins. I was blown away and lost the bet. 

Store in value needs a secondary use case to be successful long term. This is just how it works but people are treating btc like shares. Bitcoin was designed to use from consumer to merchant for anything. You cannot buy a $30 item or whatever with btc anymore. The block sizes are too big. People seem to be forgetting thAt but btc was a utility. It’s no longer “decentralized” because you have can’t do much without a financial exchange. More will become clear over the next few months. The funny thing is the bitcoin cash seems to mimic the original white paper better than btc. 

I have no dog in this race. I am not taking sides to take sides. I think these augments are dumb and uneducated. However, I think bitcoin cash is going to win in due time unless btc gets fixed. They have too many bottlenecks. BTC was not designed for rapid adoption and $17k value per coin and crazy mind blowing fees. Fees and decentralization don’t go together.  It grew too fast and none of this thought about. 

I don’t know what the future holds for bitcoin but I’m pretty sure bitcoin needs to cut politics and get to work. Fees suck. Slow speeds suck. Legacy architecture sucks.

"Hello friends, this is my first post. Seeing all the events of the last 3 months, I think the time has come to react intelligently and strategically. I'm sure the greatest intellectual force is in the Bitcoin Core team, several brilliant minds in coding and programming. I may be wrong, but in my perception, we lack a defense / combat strategy in narrative control. Our opponents are well articulated, strategically positioned, playing as a team, with a defined game plan and a lot of financial resources. So, now is the time of the cultural war, we know that the mass adoption of Segwit, would greatly improve things, we also know that the implementation of Lightning will be wonderful in the future, but we can not sit around waiting for these technologies to come true in the day to day.
for example, Segwit is already a reality, few portfolios and brokers are with the technology deployed, what do we do? We complain (rightly), but lack more effective action, we need to agree on measures to be taken against those people who are harming us, we will be harmed without even defending ourselves? A lot of people may not like him, but my intuition is that the BTC team urgently needed a guy like the late Andrew Breitbart, a brilliant strategist for a war that's already going on.";0;0;False;tpiza;driq9j2;Coordinated bitcoin dump + network attack with high fees + coinbase adding Bcash...

"So I don't get this. Coinbase added Bcash in the same way that it added Litecoin (I wasn't around when Coinbase added Eth so I cannot vouch for that): without any announcements until the day it was released. 

Litecoin was added for consumer purchase on Coinbase on 3 May 2017. If you observe the Bitfinex LTCUSD charts from early April to hours before LTC was released, you will see that Litecoin gained approximately 100%: from a low of 10 USD to almost 20 USD before it surged to a high of almost 40 USD after the release. Isn't this a symptom/sign of insider trading (similar to that for Bcash's)? 

So why is it that when Bcash pumps prior to its release, it's not okay and Coinbase folks need to go to jail for collusion and insider trading, while no similar complaints about Litecoin and Coinbase were made when it was released on Coinbase in May this year?

"He is an asshole for the tax disaster he unleashed on his customers. By waiting to allow control of BCH until today, mixed with a major BCH pump, combined with the knowledge that all of the records will land in the hands of the IRS very soon is borderline economic terrorism. Leading tax advise is that chin forks should be counted as misc income for US persons. The tax event occurs when you have any ability to control the asset. For those in control of their keys, it was the day of the fork. The IRS cares not if you even know it happened, you are on the hook. 

On the fork day the BCH price was $267. So a hodlr of 100 BTC received $26.7k in ordinary taxable income. A coinbase customer had no way to exercise control over their BCH until today, so the taxable event was today. Today's average price is massively higher. Let's use  3k for sake of discussion. That's $300k in ordinary income that needs to be claimed. An extra 300k in income dropped on you with two weeks left in the year, how are you suppose to plan for an extra 100k in tax due?? Something you didn't ask for but was forced upon you. If you ignore it, the IRS will get the records from Coinbase and come after you for tax fraud in due time. You are a easy, low hanging fruit.

I said, of course there is.

Immediately his follower kid jumped up with NO THERE ISN'T! THAT'S JUST STUPID!

And I calmly said, ""I am sure there is. You seem very concerned with seeming smart.""

I admitted I didn't know the formula and the first guy says ah something you don't know. And I say there's lots of things I don't know, but at least *I don't pretend they don't exist.* And the next day my friend came to me with the formula he got from one of the cool young professors.

"i don't know much about crypto, and don't pretend to. But after thanksgiving, where people went home to their families and spread the word about bitcoin to their siblings and cousins and parents, etc.. it went up, along with exchange registrations.. like a lot of them, hundreds of thousands in 3 days

can't imagine Xmas will be any different, if not more significant. everyone can point to gains they had in the past month while showing how it's also being accepted by futures markets

i can't imagine it would just fall out of the sky. not any time soon. as soon as it drops people will pounce. How could it stay down or die in the next 1-6 months? i feel like the popularity/widespread craze is just getting starting

"So for a few weeks, everyone has been speculating which coin will be added to coinbase. Whatever coin it is will likely see a big jump in price because coinbase is the most popular cryptocurrancy exchange in the U.S. 


Yesterday, some fishy stuff started happening. In the morning, the SEC suspends Bitcoin trading for The Crytpo Company, which ""offers a portfolio of digital assets, technologies, and consulting services to the blockchain and cryptocurrency markets""

This began a small bitcoin price drop because people began doubting bitcoin more due to the news.

Shortly after, Emil Oldenburg, the CTO and co-founder of bitcoin.com announces that he sold all his bitcoin for bcash. Everyone who knows who Emil is already knew he was a massive bcash supporter. Not to mention, bitcoin.com is not really a bitcoin fully supported website. It was created by those that lead bcash to basically have people think bcash is bitcoin and invest in bcash when they hear the hype about bitcoin. So people that know what's going on saw that Emil sold his coins and were like ""eh, ok that's no surprise at all"", but the masses read ""bitcoin.com founder sell bitcoin for bcash"" and go crazy and start selling bitcoin thinking it's about to tank.

So the price starts going down gradually after these two things go public. 

Then, coinbase comes out of left field ""We are adding bcash to coinbase"". 

Bitcoin price tanks to like 13 - 14k.

A lot of people start taking money out of bitcoin and moving it to bcash knowing bcash was about to  go up.

Clearly, all of this happening in nearly perfect sequential order is a clear sign of some shady shit going on behind the scenes.

However, coinbase kinda screwed the pooch. Long story short, their site glitched and people were simply buying bcash on coinbase without the ability to sell in time before they locked trading. So now, you have the price of bcash on every other exchange reflecting the correct price (~3K) while it's stuck at 9,500 on gdax!!

Now, whoever bought bcash during the hype is praying to sell at such an insane price. However, if it tanks before then, they could lose a shit load of money unless coinbases fixes all of this.";1;1;False;FalcoLamborghini;drj3wak;Coordinated bitcoin dump + network attack with high fees + coinbase adding Bcash...

"you are joking right?

First thing in the morning:

**SEC announces suspension of bitcoin futures trades... out of fucking nowhere...they HAD to know something was about to happen today**

Then after that: 

**one of bitcoin.com founders and known supporter of bcash says ""I sold all by bit coins for bcash""... Price begins to go from 19k to 17k in a matter of hours. with a A LOT of bitcoin negativity on this sub**

LITERALLY A FEW HOURS LATER... 

**Coinbases announces bcash on coinbase and gadax.**

Dude this shit was planned. Could not be more obvious. 

**EDIT**: It was not futures suspension - it was the suspension of bitcoin for a firm by the SEC. http://money.cnn.com/2017/12/19/investing/bitcoin-crytpocurrencies-sec-bubble/

"It had a sharp sharp sharp sharp drop! Like, sharper than I've ever seen (Well, not since Jan 2014... we all know what happened. And i don't watch the charts often, so there may have been steeper.).

I saw 15.5K hit, minutes later, steady at 16.5K.

I actually NEEDED that steep drop to prove to myself that there's enough support, investors waiting to get onboard.

Because back in the day if the price dropped 5% it would go to 15% really fast (source needed). I think it's because confidence was lacking in this newfound digital currency. According to HODLers back then, a steep drop could mean the end of Bitcoin forever. Certainly was the case for me. ""I got in the game expecting to lose my investment. I guess that's what I'm watching now."" That mindset sure has changed over the years (Well, since 2014 not that long ago lol!)

These steep drops shed the SODLers (certainly not soldiers). For every steep drop, there are a few new HODLers who jump on the train. I welcome them aboard!!! 

However this party is not done yet. Still more action to see.

"Even if they did fully enable segwit it wouldn't immediately accomplish anything. For one thing you can't just suddenly make existing Bitcoins sit in a segwit address without first transacting into a segwit address, who's going to eat that initial fee? If everyone suddenly tried to move their Bitcoin into a segwit address what do you think will happen to the transaction fees!?

To benefit from the segwit discount the Bitcoins must originate from a segwit address, so you have to pay a fee to move the coins into one to begin with.

There also needs to be much better wallet support for segwit, it'd be nice if Core supported segwit change addresses for one thing.

It's only after everyone has moved a ton of Bitcoin into segwit addresses and they start spending from those exclusively that we'll see increased throughput and even then at the current pace of use it's unlikely it'd be enough of a throughput increase to drop the fees down to what people want.

"Yes, it’s true. 

They left the price of BCH on the GDAX exchange side at $9500.

It still says that now.

Trading is still suspended, however, on the GDAX home page BCH is $0.

The motivations seem obvious to me.

Social engineering and market manipulation at its finest.

Follow the volume.

BCH trading on GDAX crashed and was suspended at that price at 8:30AM Beijing Time, 9:30AM Tokyo/ Seoul/ Beijing time.

What a coincidence.

Everyone in Asia is at their desk and ready to pile money in the game.

Aside from the coordinated attack, the 9500 BCH GDAX price sitting open, fueling further speculation in Asia.

Coinbase retail folks may end up picking up the slack and getting dumped on.

This is an irresponsible, reckless and possibly criminal rollout by Coinbase.

There’s ZERO education or proper user on-boarding of BCH on their site. All the retail money piling into Coinbase must be utterly confused. 

I can see new retail investors piling into BCH thinking they are buying “Bitcoin”, BTC.

I wouldn’t be surprised if people buy BCH and send it off exchange to BTC wallets.

And, there’s a strong possibility there will be a lot of retail investors burned and left holding the bag on this one.

Then there’s Brian Armstrong’s hollow shat out crisis relations firm doctored Medium article regarding Coinbase’s “Employee Purchase Policy” - this hit at 2:30AM EST:

https://blog.coinbase.com/our-employee-trading-policy-at-coinbase-1d4e860b7837?source=linkShare-131901444fb3-1513775880

“The policy prohibits employees and contractors from trading on “material non-public information”, such as when a new asset will be added to our platform. In addition to trading restrictions, it prohibits communication of material non-public information outside the company. This includes to friends and family.”

Ok everyone, so, don’t do it. ;)

How is that enforced and tracked exactly?

Details please.

What a load of corporate mouthpiece bullshit.

The mere secrecy and games behind the rollout dates fuel acting against this policy even more.

All the API and on site smoke signal shit they’re doing to further fuel speculation on coin additions is reckless, irresponsible and destructive to the overall arc of this movement.

Clearly, Coinbase are acting with malicious, self-serving, hostile intent.

They’re now a serious fail point in this movement.

If retail investors pile up BCH and get dumped on, this could spark a large regulatory overplay and damage the movement.

Finally, people dump on the common person, the retail investor just getting in, if this movement is going to go anywhere, it takes all.

This kind of bullshit seriously dampens retail enthusiasm.

So yeah, fuck those crooks at Coinbase and fuck the ideological BCH clown squad who all may put a serious dent in the adoption rate of the inevitable and no, I don’t mean just BTC. That’s the gateway drug.

"One does not ""fix the fees"". Even if that would be possible, it would be ""fixing the symptom"". And this is an Open Source project. There is no ""they"".

The fees are a symptom of several things:

* Large amounts of transactions. Only Ethereum handles more transactions than Bitcoin. And it's fees are also high (but not near Bitcoins'). Any Altcoin can come back when they *actualy* handle the volume *and* transaction amount that Bitcoin handles.
* There is technology ready, tested and proved. You, me, us, (and not ""they"") are rolling this out as we speak. *if* this (lighning network) works, and *if* it fullfills its promise, then fees on the main chain will go down, *and* you and I don't need to pay fees at all anymore.";4;2;False;berkes;drifd32;Coordinated bitcoin dump + network attack with high fees + coinbase adding Bcash...

"An open source project is still subject to outside influences. Bitcoin isn’t going to die, the worst that will happen is the value will dip and the recover over time. It’s a deflationary currency, it grows over time by nature. 

Bitcoin also isn’t the only “correct” cryptocurrency, because it can’t fill every niche simultaneously...it simply can’t. I recommend Bitcoin as a store of value and other projects for other purposes...BAT for paying content producers, Litecoin for relatively small purchases, etc.

Find projects that suit your lifestyle and support them - cryptocurrency isn’t about making a quick buck, it’s about reforming our economy such that people can truly manage their own finances, without needing to rely on a profiteering middle-man.

"> my full node, along with every other one, will drop your miner from the network.

Can you clarify a bit how this is done? You can refuse to relay blocks, but if the blocks are valid, then presumably there will be some % of non-mining nodes that WILL relay the blocks.

Moreover, attacks on non-mining nodes are attacks on transaction broadcast / blockchain distribution. However it's not an attack on the blockchain itself, which requires hashpower.

>Also, decentralized, means that all these parts are controlled by different entities, on different geographical locations.

So, using your definition, BTC is centralized, is it not? (I actually agree with your definition)

Let's say you're right that non-mining nodes are critical to network integrity. I'm an attacker, let's say I'm China to make it easy. What stops me from running a million nodes? Very little.

On the other hand, while a nation-state getting majority hashpower is feasible, it's not nearly as easy because of the profit incentive of mining. Non-miners have no profit incentive and thus are vulnerable to attack from a well-capitalized enemy.

>Not one party, in one datacenter. 10k AWS nodes and Jihan mining all the POW is not decentralization.

I agree. However BCH isn't just running because of Jihan or whoever the designated scapegoat is. It's certainly vulnerable to attack, primarily because BTC still has more hashrate.

"SPV clients can't verify that blocks are valid. They can verify the proof of work and therefore select the highest difficulty chain, and they can verify that a block contains a given transaction. They can't verify that:

"**Store of value**

A store of value is the function of an asset that can be saved, retrieved and exchanged at a later time, and be predictably useful when retrieved. More generally, a store of value is anything that retains purchasing power into the future.

The most common store of value in modern times has been money, currency, or a commodity like a precious metal or financial capital. The point of any store of value is risk management due to a stable demand for the underlying asset.

They took a step backwords stating that it is a huge leap forward.

Please show your math. I've done the math, and big blocks seem viable. Exponential increase in tx throughput requires exponential increase in blocksize. This is countered by exponential improvement in computing power and storage space. The end result is some constant multiple, which is quite acceptable (we can always handle a constant, we can't handle unbounded exponential growth without an exponential offset).

"> Its not limited to 8mb .. it can go to 32 mb and their master plan to scale is just to continue increasing the blocksize.

It's not actually, check the dev updates.

> It's not just a matter of hard drive space. The reality is even at 32 mb block size the transactions per second rate is unimpressive. It slows the growth of bitcoin and LTC would win and BTC would be in a state where it could no longer compete with other coins.

It's storage space, CPU time and bandwidth.  Also, LTC's 2.5min block time is basically equivalent to 4mb blocks (with Segwit, so let's say 6-7mb for tx equivalency).   

> Forget about running 4000 transactions a second on a 10 mb connection you're going to need a gig.. and again .. 4000 transactions a second isn't impressive for what bitcoin is suppose to be.

Even Satoshi said, your average 10mbps connection user doesn't need to sync the transaction history of the planet (he was AFAIK the first one to mention light clients/SPV).  

There seem to be rampant misconceptions about what L2 can accomplish.  On top of the base layer of BTC, the best thing they can accomplish is reducibilty and non-immediate commitment of a state change.   So for an indefinitely recursive u_n = T1(T2(T3(T4[...](u_m)))), a summary transaction of the state changes from u_m to u_n, and/or a layer of transactions that haven't been committed to the chain.  I can't emphasize this enough.  LN and other L2 techs aren't magic, they can only simplify what gets committed and retain things in an uncommitted state.  Wild guess, maybe a 1/2-1/4x  relative  rate of increase for chain size.  So you need both on and off-chain scaling.

"Hmm, there are a few things here that don't sound quite right.

>There will be huge delays but, like the mempool, nothing is really forgotten. Only delayed. Correct?

Mempool transactions do actually get dropped out of the mempool if fees are too low and the mempool is too clogged. But in general it's just a delay, yes.

>If 100 percent of NoMineNodes decide to drop every block except one with special interest then they still can't add that block to the blockchain since they're not miners. Or maybe they can, but the honest/real miners won't accept it and will therefore quickly become a ""least work chain"". Correct?

So, the miners produce the blocks, and the non-mining nodes exist to relay them. Thus with 100% control, you can prevent the network from relaying newly found blocks, but you're not actually modifying the blockchain. You're just preventing people from finding out about the blockchain's most recent state. Note that I'm not even convinced you can censor block distribution in this way because you only need a fraction of ""honest"" non-mining nodes to distribute. Plus miners can propagate blocks/transactions themselves, unless my understanding is way off.

>I understand the decentralization part completely. Nodes = more copies. More copies = more security. These questions are geared more towards ""what power do nodes actually have"" kind of thing.

That is exactly the crux of the issue. What power do non-mining nodes really have? My position is very little, as was intended by Satoshi. If non-miners did have enormous power, it would be far cheaper for a nation-state to take control of 99.9% of non-mining nodes than it would be to take control of 99% of hashpower.

>If 100 percent of NoMineNodes decide to drop every block except one with special interest then they still can't add that block to the blockchain since they're not miners. Or maybe they can, but the honest/real miners won't accept it and will therefore quickly become a ""least work chain"". Correct?

They can't produce blocks, because they don't mine, and mining is directly the activity that produces blocks and therefore processes transactions.

What non-mining nodes do is relay transactions to other nodes, and hold unconfirmed tx in their mempool, so that mining nodes can worry about mining and then rely on the non-miners to figure out what transactions are available to be put into blocks (and then greedily sort by highest sat/byte fee to maximize profit).

Bitcoin has a simple principle: where there is profit incentive, there is power, and vice versa. This makes it so that free-market dynamics lead to the network being strengthened against attack. These dynamics do not exist with non-mining nodes, which is why Satoshi didn't even have the concept in his whitepaper ( what he called nodes are miners, which makes for confusion when Core supporters quote parts of the whitepaper and pretend he's talking about full-blockchain non-mining nodes [full nodes] )

"Nobody, but that is very difficult, because you only need a few nodes to keep the network running. Critically, taking down all non-mining nodes would prevent tx from being broadcast, but it would have no effect on the underlying blockchain. For example, controlling all the non-mining nodes would not allow you to double spend.

Remember, there is no profit incentive for running a non-mining node. Therefore there is not much investment, and a nation-state could easily achieve 95% non-mining node control. However 100% would be very difficult although I suppose you could just DDOS the remaining nodes.

If 100 percent of NoMineNodes decide to drop every block except one with special interest then they still can't add that block to the blockchain since they're not miners. Or maybe they can, but the honest/real miners won't accept it and will therefore quickly become a ""least work chain"". Correct? 

Likewise, if all miners except one(special interest block miner) do their own thing then eventually the correct blocks will be relayed and everything will move on as usual. There will be huge delays but, like the mempool, nothing is *really* forgotten. Only delayed. Correct? 

As I learn about bitcoin these weird question come up and I have to get the right answers before I can move on. Hate having holes in my understanding.

Network latency, among other things. The world wide web is as strong as its weakest links. Larger block sizes increase bandwidth (and storage) requirements for full nodes, and risk of orphaned blocks for miners.

"> Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash miners are the same miners - so if miners can be influenced then both coins have a problem. 

Both coins do have a problem. SHA256 is broken. But that problem is far more exasperated in BCH.

Sure, the network is fine now with >50% of nodes controlled by one entity, but what happens when its 60%? 80%? 95%? What happens when nearly everyone running a node is also mining?

BCH's big blocks have two big centralization problems. First, they centralize nodes because they cause nodes to grow much more rapidly. But secondly, perhaps more troubling, is that they centralize mining because larger blocks increase consensus delay which increases the risk of mining orphan blocks.

In addition, BCH offers a number of gifts to centralized miners. Retaining the ASICboost vulnerability, for example, which Bitmain owns the Chinese patent on, and which increases mining efficiency by ~20% in exchange for producing empty blocks. The removal of opt-in RBF (a feature of the original BTC whitepaper and client, btw) which increases the number of trxs that need to be processed by miners. The decision to eschew segwit which increases the average size of trxs, and which prevents second layer solutions to trx volume issues. These are all gifts to miners in exchange for more mining centralization and/or more network congestion.

BCH may only be a bit more centralized than BTC right now, but BCH is much more *centralizing* than BTC. If BCH becomes the new BTC we will see it gradually shift from being a decentralized network to Paypal with a convoluted data structure at its heart. And in exchange for what? A temporary reprieve from trx speed and fee issues which only pushes the problem down the road and makes it worse in the process?

Many BCH miners are BTC miners, you're right. ViaBTC, for example, has decided to automatically switch between BTC and BCH depending on which is more profitable in the moment. Perhaps, if BCH is to remain a high cap, high hashrate asset, it will become difficult for miners to attract capital unless they participate in mining both based on their profitability. And if that's the case then BTC really does have a problem, as BTC mining may be forced to follow the same centralization trends that BCH will.";103;7;False;the8thbit;drj6mm4;54% of reachable Bcash full nodes are running on virtual servers of Alibaba in China, against only 2% of Bitcoin, hmmmm;7l1kss;https://twitter.com/lopp/status/943479553829343232

"> Network latency, among other things. The world wide web is as strong as its weakest links. Larger block sizes increase bandwidth (and storage) requirements for full nodes, and risk of orphaned blocks for miners.

It can increase bandwidth usage, sure.  Let's run that math though.  8mb block every 10 minutes, on an average connection let's call that 5 seconds.  So that's (60/5) * 10, 120 propagations per block for each node.  Are they syncing and raising like 80-100 other nodes every block?

> The larger the block, the less people that can afford to mine or run full nodes. You are forcing miners and node operators to centralize around network hubs to remain viable in the bitcoin network.

See my other comments in thread ([example](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7l1kss/54_of_reachable_bcash_full_nodes_are_running_on/drjcpet/)).  It's not necessary for all nodes to retain the blockchain tail indefinitely if you can simply reach network consensus as to the current UTXO state.

You can't maintain that title with a system which accomplishes its scaling via raising the minimum requirements to participate on the network.

Let's reframe that.  Bitcoin is meant to be a global digital asset, a currency accessible to all.  *That won't work if you only allow 5 transactions a second to be recorded on its ledger,* even with fancy tricks like LN that can help simplify what state changes are recorded (the best thing they can hope to accomplish).

First of all, there is no mention of RBF in the whitepaper. Second, transactions are lighter without SegWit, not heavier. SegWit just removes some data from the blockchain. Malleability in bitcoin cash is already fixed, you can use LN without segwit without any problems whatsoever.

But secondly, perhaps more troubling, is that they centralize mining because larger blocks increase consensus delay which increases the risk of mining orphan blocks.

First, I take issue with the claim that large blocks cause node centralization.  It's trivial to form consensus on a UTXO u at a given block height n, with block T, T(u_n) -> T(u_n_plus_1) being the only transformation a validating ""floating"" node has to perform.  And with an 8mb block size, the maximum capacity is about 400gb/yr, which is an expense of about $100 every 10 years at current HD pricing (double that for a simple RAID).  

As for miner centralization - what is latency on a high speed connection for 8mb?  1 second, if even.  Versus 10mb time between blocks.  Nope.

"> He is not using a slippery slope argument, he argued how big the blocks must be to get us back to nearly free transactions. And then he compares that to our growing rate of adoption and using that, predicts how big our future blocks must be.

This is the exact definition of a slippery slope argument... the implication that if we do it once, we have to continue doing it at higher amounts. Instead, he should recognize that Segwit and the lowering of transaction sizes in general will not be enough, and that at the very least we should recognize that a 2x increase now will put us closer to what will eventually need to be at. He's implying that a blocksize increase necessitates continuing to do so as if it would necessarily mean throwing out other solutions like Segwit or Schorr Signatures or Lightning Network.

The argument for a 2x increase is the logical middle ground: That although Segwit and Schorr Signatures and Lightning Network will do a lot, it will also need a small increase on top of that to function properly with all of the increased traffic it will most likely cause. We don't have to commit to blocksize increases being the way we'll handle the situation next time, we just need to recognize that where we currently are, at 1MB (or ~2.7 with Segwit) will most likely never be enough if we want to be utilized at a world wide scale, even if almost everyone is using off-chain solutions, since they require on-chain transactions like when LN opens or closes a channel.";8;1;False;Korberos;drjdx9t;54% of reachable Bcash full nodes are running on virtual servers of Alibaba in China, against only 2% of Bitcoin, hmmmm;7l1kss;https://twitter.com/lopp/status/943479553829343232

"Seen it and disagree.  Block size increase = transaction capacity increase, full stop.  The blockchain is just a chain of linked transactions - if you want to add more, you have to have the capacity to add more.  The only thing Lightning and similar can do is find clever ways to reduce the # of transactions that end up on the chain (not to downplay that this can help).  And I've found Andreas's usual reasoning to be a slippery slope fallacy - that 8mb is a bad idea because 1gb or 10gb blocks would cause centralization (which is honestly debatable, I reckon there are some clever tricks you can use to safely scale up to huge blocks).

Full node centralization (as in OP here) isn't a decent marker of centralization BTW.  Miner centralization is the real concern, which honestly only seems to emerge as an issue with BCH because of variance in mining profitability and miners switching between chains.

Beyond that this is meaningless... Alibaba is a perfectly sane place to run nodes, they (I assume) have multiple data centres so the nodes are decentralised.

Furthermore node count is a poor metric of anything. It's cheap to setup nodes to run anywhere (even for BCH's larger blockchain).
