"Electrum is a pretty good wallet to start out with. It's pretty much plug-and-play, when it comes to use. Just download, launch... and you should be ready to go.

Coinbase would not be optimal. I don't know for sure, because they've blocked Guatemala... but from what I could research, it seems you can only buy and sell at current price, which leaves you at a disadvantage. With that kind of trading, you'd need to be continuously logged in and very attentive to current price. Bitcoin's volatility is very much moment-to-moment. With bitfinex, you don't need to be so active all the time. That's where Limit Orders come in handy. When it comes to buying and selling, there are different types of orders that can help you set the rules you want for your buys and sells. Market, Limit, and Stop-limit are the ones I use and like the most. the TL;DR explanation for each is as follows

- Market: The current price is good for me! Hook me up with the current buy offer or sell offer. Sell/buy right now.

- Limit: There is a certain price I want to buy or sell at. When the buy or sell offer matches the price I've set to buy or sell at, the exchange will make that buy/sell for me. Buy/sell at the price I set, whenever it happens.

- Stop-Limit: If the price hits a price I set, create a limit order at another price I've set. 

These are available to you in Bitfinex.

... And lastly...

"> The only place that 'bitcoin investors' are getting money from is later investors.   

If I buy gold at $1500/oz and sell it at $2000/oz, does that make gold a Ponzi? No, it just means that demand has increased faster than supply. It's the same thing with bitcoin.  

This post explains this all in greater detail, citing the World Bank report that concludes that bitcoin is not a Ponzi. https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/world-bank-bitcoin-not-ponzi-scheme/

exactly what they said about poloniex before it gave out bch and the price jumped like double. The true issue that BTCers dont seem to want to talk about is that 2nd layer solutions offer very convenient points for government to regulate the manner in which BTC functions. with Lightning network being very centralized and allowing government a convenient opportunity to seize any lightning network nodes and regulate who can send what thru Lightning network effectively turning bitcoin into FEDcoin where we can again deny people access to the blockchain or any other use of the blockchain that requires Lightning or such second layer solutions. this also becomes important as government struggles with HOW TO TAX bitcoin because obviously that is the ONLY thing governments give a shit about. thats one of the larger concerns of BCH hodlers, again of which I am not one. there are some libertarian reddits that are able to have civil discussions about these issues, and it might be better to ask there, since they at least try to maintain integrity and reason in political discussions. ;2;0;False;-RustyShakleford;dofo6wx;We made a Bitcoin Roller Coaster Mover Prototype using a Raspberry Pi.

"The US economy would collapse if it had to rely on bitcoin as its main currency.

Bitcoin cannot handle the volume of transactions in the US economy, and even if it could the transaction times make it impossible for most businesses to use.

McDonalds, Walmart, Target, Starbucks cannot wait 10 minutes for your bitcoin transaction to confirm, let alone the hours it would take if everyone in the US suddenly started using bitcoin.

In the extremely unlikely even the USD collapsed people would just switch to another fiat currency which is what always happens when a fiat currency collapses.

The Zimbabwean dollar collapsed recently. Has Zimbabwe moved over to bitcoin? No. They just use dollars and yen and other fiat currencies.

the market cap of bitcoin is 91 billion dollars.

The entire market cap of bitcoin could be wiped out and the US wouldn't even notice, especially since so much of bitcoin is held in China and Japan.
