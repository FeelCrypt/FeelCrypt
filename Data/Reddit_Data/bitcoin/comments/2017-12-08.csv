"In the very early days of bitcoin around 2009-2011 (early 2011), you could just mine them by downloading a client and leaving it running. This client would use your computer's CPU to run a mathematical algorithm (which serves no purpose aside from validating transactions really). You would then be rewarded with bitcoins. Once 2011 came, mining switched over to GPUs since they were far faster and more efficient than CPUs. A few years later in 2013-2014 time period, ASIC machines (Application Specific Intergrated Circuit) took over and mining became far more centralized.
Nowadays most BTC is mined in enormous data centers filled with ASIC machines (which cost about 4000-5000 each and take about 6 months to pay off their value). The issue with this is that it centralizes the wealth and power of BTC in the hands of a few people, which is the complete opposite of a ""decentralized"" currency. The problem with this? When people don't agree, they just leave and take their processing power with them (which is being used to validate transactions and ensure the book is legitimate). Hence why there are so many ""forks"", though segwit 2x was cancelled.
Early users would get 50 bitcoins very quickly to reward early adopters and you could mine literally hundreds/thousands of bitcoins in a week (Bitcoin is around $7000 at the moment). In 2009, 1000-1500 bitcoins were worth about $1. Today they would be worth between $7-10.5 million. In 2010, people were trying to sell bitcoin too. Famous stories such as the guy who tried to sell 10,000 BTC for $50 (worth $70 million today and no one bought it from him) or the guy who traded 10,000 BTC for pizza are well known in the crypto community. If you left your computer running the client for a month in 2009 or early 2010 and never touched those coins until today, you'd probably easily clear $50 million.
Hindsight is 20/20. BTC was a brand new and no one knew back then would turn into a revolutionary technology. The vast majority of BTC mined back then was sold at far lower prices ($1, 5, 10, 100, etc etc). Several million BTC were also lost since there were no online wallets back then, just hardware ones. Many people threw out their BTC because they considered it ""worthless"". A lot of 50 BTC wallets are now just ""lost"", each of them worth over $300,000.
Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of BTC, has the most BTC at over 1.1 million (more than most exchanges combined), which is worth over $7 billion today. However these coins are considered sort of ""lost"" since Satoshi hasn't moved them or even touched them since 2009. His public addresses are well known, so people would know if the coins start moving. The crypto market is abuzz when a very large stack of BTC from 2009-early 2010 starts moving since that means old coins are moving back into circulation rather than just being considered ""lost"".

"The title is misleading.

Concealed ownership in and of itself won't be criminalized if this act is passed, although it's important to remember how words can be manipulated and seeds can be sown with bills like these.

[**The act**](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/1241/text#toc-idCF2B3955A9F145DB86B93851A941F78C) only states what most of us probably already thought existed:

>#SEC. 18. Prohibition on concealment of ownership of account.

>“(a) In general.—No person shall knowingly conceal, falsify, or misrepresent, or attempt to conceal, falsify, or misrepresent, from or to a financial institution, a material fact ***concerning the ownership or control of*** an account or assets held in ***an account with a financial institution.***

If you have a bank account, they don't want you hiding it from the government.

If you have Coinbase account, they don't want you hiding it from the government.

If you have a hardware / paper wallet, that's ***not*** a financial institution, and not applicable.

However, it touches on border crossing/entry into the United States:

>#SEC. 13. Prepaid access devices, digital currencies, or other similar instruments.
    
>(A) by inserting “prepaid access devices, ***digital currency***,” after “money orders,”; and
    
>(B) by inserting before the semicolon at the end the following: “, or any ***digital exchanger or tumbler of digital currency***”;
    
>“(7) ‘prepaid access device’ means an electronic device or vehicle, such as a card, plate, code, number, electronic serial number, mobile identification number, personal identification number, or ***other instrument, that provides a portal to funds or the value of funds that have been paid in advance and can be retrievable and transferable at some point in the future.”.***
    
>(c) Customs and border protection strategy for prepaid access devices.—Not later than 18 months after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, shall submit to Congress a report—
    
>(1) detailing a ***strategy to interdict and detect*** prepaid access devices, ***digital currencies***, or other similar instruments, ***at border crossings and other ports of entry for the United States***; and

"This is ironic, because I did not even read the editorialized content to which you refer.  I made my post today based on reading the actual text from S. 1241 months ago.  S. 1241 proposes to amend Section 5312(a) of title 31, United States Code, adding the words ""digital currencies"" after ""money orders"" in a clause that included ""cash"" from the existing Title 31 regulations.  That is why I said it likens digital currencies to cash.  Some of the relevant text is below, directly from S. 1241 (not from anyone's editorial):

SEC. 13. PREPAID ACCESS DEVICES, DIGITAL CURRENCIES, OR OTHER SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS.
(a) In General.—Section 5312(a) of title 31, United States Code, is amended—

True.  IMO the one thing that has prevented widespread abuse by state & local authorities is the public visibility eg investigative reports on behalf of the victims of CAF (eg. by 60 minutes or other programs) to shed light on abuse by the government.  They probably don't want to abuse their CAF power rampantly for fear of losing it altogether.  That's probably little consolation to those who have had to spend tens of thousands of dollars on attorneys to sue and prove their own innocence just to get their rightful property or cash back, but anyway that's probably why it's not totally unrestrained to date.

"**Ex post facto law**

An ex post facto law (corrupted from Latin: ex postfacto, lit. 'out of the aftermath') is a law that retroactively changes the legal consequences (or status) of actions that were committed, or relationships that existed, before the enactment of the law. In criminal law, it may criminalize actions that were legal when committed; it may aggravate a crime by bringing it into a more severe category than it was in when it was committed; it may change the punishment prescribed for a crime, as by adding new penalties or extending sentences; or it may alter the rules of evidence in order to make conviction for a crime likelier than it would have been when the deed was committed. Conversely, a form of ex post facto law commonly called an amnesty law may decriminalize certain acts.

"BTC to USD. 

It's just making it so US based exchanges are treated like banks in that they're required to share account information with the IRS (and if a warrant is issued, with other agencies). You'll also be required to file an FBAR if you have funds in foreign exchanges in excess of $10,000. 

With this classification, it's also opening the door to potential federal insurance (or even larger scale private insurance) on US based reserves, which can prevent an exchange from stealing your currency. It's also a step towards legitimizing cryptocurrencies. 

However, depending on what happens with the future of cryptos, you may begin to see reserve requirements on these institutions. Currently, banks are required to keep a certain percentage of their reserve open for withdrawals (usually 7-9%). Occasionally, they'll also be required to deposit a bit of it with the Reserve in order to control money supply. These policies are designed to help keep banks from going under because they put too much of their funds at risk.

The quote that was editorialized:
“criminalize [those] intentionally concealing ownership or control of a [digital currency or digital exchange] account.”

The uneditorialized quote:
“criminalizes intentionally concealing ownership or control of a bank account.”

Not at all the same.

Digital exchange account, yes. Digital currency account, no. (that doesn't even make sense, wallets aren't ""accounts"", yet the impetus on these threads is to say that the gov are retards that don't know that, instead of the editorializer making shit up) The implication is ""holding on your own wallet"" versus ""holding on an exchange.""

But please, enlighten me why you believe the government should not be allowed to regulate the government's currency? If you don't like it so much, why are you exchanging bitcoin for $$$? As stated in the above quote, if you don't use a KYC/AML exchange, they can't know your holdings.

"What do you mean by ""declare your bitcoins"" ?

I don't see anything in the bill about ""declaring"" anything.

There's no process by which you regularly tell the government what assets or accounts you have....  in fact  the 5th amendment prohibits search and seizure without a warrant;   so a law requiring every citizen to ""declare every possession in the world you own""  would be not only a privacy violation,  but unconstitutional.

"The goal is to talk about crypto in general first, talk about some of the success on foreign soil with altcoins like Ripple. 

The group wants a basic understanding of what bitcoin is and *why* it is the way it is. Rather than get to technical, I'm going to give a nice crash course on the blockchain.

Then I'll dive into economic bonuses of the system being deflationary, money saved by crowsourcing and incentivising transaction calculation, transaction fees for large transfers in banks, and deregulation /decentralization of the currency as a whole (Republicans love deregulation, they eat that shit up). And of course, the huge potential benefit for the people who would push for the U. S. to benefit in bitcoin adoption.

Ultimately I have a lot of knowledge on many facets of crypto and, depending on what they *want* to know, I have the research and knowledge to back it up.

They don't need a validation of authority, they have it and you are not the one who gives it.  What they need is a reality check and only honest discussion allows that.  A portion of politicians are not corrupt - it is important to generally assume that they are not unless proven otherwise, and if not proven, they are just ignorant.  If they are ignorant, well, we need to enlighten them.  They have jobs they focus on all day.  They can't learn about everything in the world.  They are forced to listen to everyone else and make an educated decision, and that's in an ideal world.  The only way to change things with legitimate politicians is discourse, and for the corrupt, money you can't afford.  So, I see it as you should be taking a shot at every senator hoping a few are good and will fight the good fight.  If nothing else expose who won't.  The longer it takes to regulate it, the more powerful it will become and the harder it will be to stop.;1;0;False;Herculix;dqypcjd;Us Senate Bill S.1241 to criminalize concealed ownership of Bitcoin;7iey6q;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7iey6q/us_senate_bill_s1241_to_criminalize_concealed/

"**Stop-and-frisk in New York City**

The stop-question-and-frisk program, or stop-and-frisk, in New York City, is a New York City Police Department practice of temporarily detaining, questioning, and at times searching civilians on the street for weapons and other contraband. This is what is known in other places in the United States as the Terry stop. The rules for stop, question, and frisk are found in the state's criminal procedure law section 140.50, and are based on the decision of the US Supreme Court in the case of Terry v. Ohio.

Can a free society be banned from buying an essentially virtual product without having to tell Uncle Sam?  Will programs and apps be banned next?

"Let me give you some background first.

Years back, big companies and many very wealthy people would use passive loss as a loophole to not pay taxes. They'd basically put a small amount of money into a fake business, give it huge debts, and then say ""oh no! I lost lots of money this year!"" They'd then report huge capital losses on their returns which would offset their income.

The government put lots of laws, rules, and regulations into place to stop this. One of those was to limit annual passive loss at $3,000. However, this meant that some people would experience huge passive losses (say, a company you owned stock in went under). In order to actually allow these losses to be recognized, they allowed you to claim the loss against passive gains you report both in the past and in the future.

Let's make an example: 

Between 1997-1999, you report $10,000 in capital gains. Then in 2000, you report $200,000 in capital loss. Between 2001-2017, you once again have $10,000 per year in capital gains.

In the end you've ended up with no gain or loss. However, if you couldn't carry your loss, you'd end up with taxable income of $197,000 (10,000 per year minus the 3,000 max capital loss). 

You'd be in a pretty shitty situation, wouldn't you? At 25%, you would have paid $49,250 in taxes. 

Since you're allowed to carry it 17 years forward and 3 years back, you can subtract your capital loss from other year's income, in the end, effectively paying zero tax.";16;5;False;droans;dqyousc;Us Senate Bill S.1241 to criminalize concealed ownership of Bitcoin;7iey6q;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7iey6q/us_senate_bill_s1241_to_criminalize_concealed/
"Currently? You're only required to report it as property on your tax forms. You're not required to file an FBAR. If at any point this year you have more than $10,000 in Bitcoin stored in an overseas institution, I do recommend it, since it won't hurt you and the FBAR is a rather simple form. Plus, it'll prepare you if they do require it in the future. Accidental failure to file is a met with a fine up to $10,000 per account, whereas intentional is $100,000 or 50% of the account's balance, generally whichever is greater.

Don't worry too much about the bill being passed. Bitcoin has gotten to the size that governments will start looking at it, especially since major institutions are taking part.

I like Hartson's positions, but she's pretty green—I think challenging Feinstein requires some experience, and De Leon is president of the state senate.

">Why do you need a lawyer, and why did you have literally all of your property seized? Surely you'd have thought of that beforehand.

Because I do not know how to prove that in a court of law. Of course not literally all property. But perhaps most of the disposable bit. 

>As determined by the *court*. The court and the police department are not the same thing. You do get to make an argument in court, but you also cannot expect to just get whatever amount you say it's worth.

True, but who wins in a he-said-she-said with a cop?


>That's what I meant when I referred to declaring property on your taxes. Profit made from buying & selling Bitcoin is considered a capital gain as far as I'm aware, because Bitcoin is considered to be property and not a currency by the IRS; though I may be wrong about how some of that works.

Right, so currently if I bought btc in 2014 and never sold it, I can hide it all I want until I convert to USD. This law would make that illegal. 

>>Yes

>Yes.

"The problem with that logic is that your assumption of fairness is that ""he makes more, so he should give less in percentage because he gives more in total"".

You seem to not consider that by making more, he also gets to keep a lot more. 

We have a progressive tax system because someone working for $12/hour for 2080 hours a year only makes $24960. After rent, bills, and food, what does that leave a person?

A person making $50/hour makes $104,000, and pay a progressively higher share because not only can they afford to take care of necessities, they can also afford luxury goods and spend money on things they don't need. Even with a higher tax (or hell, even a $0 tax for person making 25K), it's still fair. The person making $25K spends all of their money into the economy. They have no choice. You start taxing them, and they have to chose between food and rent. Food over rent? Lose your home. Lose your job. Now they are on the social net, or even worse off. 

No thanks, I'd rather pay ""more"", while having more, living comfortably, and not have those less well off come after me for having more.

Edit: because this comes up every time in these conversations. If the guy making 25K is not paying any tax at all on his 25K, neither am I! Our progressive system has tiers, it's not on your total income. We all pay the same tax on the same amount of money, but if you make even more, the next bracket is taxed at a higher rate, and then the bracket after that goes up a bit as well. This is why, even when someone is in the highest tax bracket, their effective tax rate is lower.

"**Tuition fees in the United Kingdom**

Tuition fees in the United Kingdom were reintroduced across in September 1998 under premiership of Tony Blair following the cross-party approved Dearing Report. Tuition fees were said to be a means of funding undergraduate and postgraduate certificate students at universities, with students being required to pay up to £1,000 a year for tuition. However, as a result of the establishment of devolved national administrations for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, different arrangements now exist with regard to the charging of tuition fees in each of the countries of the United Kingdom. In 2017, students in England typically pay the limit of £9,250.

"From the eyes of a Bitcoin enthusiast/citizen? 

They're way, way too broad already.

From the eyes of the US government, who's ability to monitor people and create money out of thin air (inflation) might disappear if this 'crypto thing' keeps going? 

Absolutely not. Bitcoin is undermining a lot of the power they hold. The government should rightly be terrified. This won't be the last law that's aimed at taking a chunk out of Bitcoin.

I think it's kind of funny though the predicament they are in. It's almost impossible to ban Bitcoin without it hurting the US gov. The only way Bitcoin can be crushed is if every major country in the world agrees to ban it simultaneously. If some do and some don't, it might survive... the ones that didn't ban it would control a large portion of a sought after global resource. The US needs control of oil because it's scarce.

That's what I meant when I referred to declaring property on your taxes. Profit made from buying & selling Bitcoin is considered a capital gain as far as I'm aware, because Bitcoin is considered to be property and not a currency by the IRS; though I may be wrong about how some of that works.

"Well illegals literally can't pay taxes because they aren't citizens. They're forced to work under the table. It's kind of hard to say they're at fault when there is no legal way for them to work.

I think we should sensibly try to keep illegals out at the border, sure, but if they're already here I don't see ripping them from communities being helpful from an economic or social standpoint. So making it possible for them to pay taxes may help with that whole issue.

And people living in poverty...do I need to say anything else?

"It has a fundamental flaw that limits its viability as a currency: it in inherently deflationary.

Currency needs to be mildly inflationary (otherwise people just hold onto it as much as possible ie it becomes a store of value).  It has no necessary day to day use (ie being buying food or paying bills) so there’s not even that use. Which means everyone (like the memers in this sub) “hodls” it.

It resembles a store of value far more than a currency. And as an intangible store of value with little real world utility at this point it’s probably going to head towards store of value or death.

You'd have a system like today where people invest in hold because it holds value, but obviously use Fiat for everything else only you'd hold your ""savings"" in BTC and withdraw/convert whichever alt ends up being dominant. 

Also obviously I see this as a ways off, BTC is great, but too volatile in my opinion to realistically replace gold, but after some time like when all the coins are mined and there are no news one, I bet it'll stabilize at a high value and be here to stay. I'd love if the world all started using a single currency, like paying with ""credits"" in every sci fi";3;0;False;machina99;dqyzg26;Us Senate Bill S.1241 to criminalize concealed ownership of Bitcoin;7iey6q;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7iey6q/us_senate_bill_s1241_to_criminalize_concealed/
"It's really really *really* not a currency. Regardless of tx and ln, it's not a currency until it's $ is stable. Without a something to back it (I dunno, maybe with a centralized financial body that can guarantee it's value?)
it's value depends solely on demand. And when demand is mostly due to its price, you have a pretty basic circular relationship for volatility

"The IRS doesn’t tax the property, they only tax the income or capital gains derived from property. Property taxes are a state and local thing.  

Now, if you fail to report the income, the federal and state governments can force you to sell your property to pay off what you owe if you can’t pay your taxes. 

As far as bitcoin goes, doesn’t the nature of bitcoin require it to be public to track the ownership and transactions on the ledger? The problem that the government has is that it is anonymous. They have the same problem with cash. The only difference is that the government can’t print bitcoins or control how much is out in the economy. This could lead to fraud, counterfeiting, and money laundering of illegal activities.

"Exactly, there is no way they can hold the bitcoin water by squeezing their fist. Nobody, no individual and no central power or government can control, manipulate, ban, hack or kill a worldwide distributed open-source peer-to-peer cryptographically secured decentralised system. Bitcoins will continue to increase in value, more than gold and silver, there will only be 21 million bitcoins ever, they are cryptographically and mathematically secured, it is decentralized, so can't be banned, co-opted or confiscated/stolen by any central group or government, you hold your own private keys. The future economy is digital and decentralized.﻿

"Did you really think we want those laws observed?"" said Dr. Ferris. ""We want them to be broken. You'd better get it straight that it's not a bunch of boy scouts you're up against... We're after power and we mean it... There's no way to rule innocent men. The only power any government has is the power to crack down on criminals. Well, when there aren't enough criminals one makes them. One declares so many things to be a crime that it becomes impossible for men to live without breaking laws. Who wants a nation of law-abiding citizens? What's there in that for anyone? But just pass the kind of laws that can neither be observed nor enforced or objectively interpreted – and you create a nation of law-breakers – and then you cash in on guilt.

"This reads like it's speaking to institutions right now, moreso than individuals. If you run a financial institution (exchange) which they define as:

>an issuer, redeemer, or cashier of prepaid access devices, digital currency, or any digital exchanger or tumbler of digital currency

Then you are mandated to not allow the anonymous purchase of digital currency. As a holder, it doesn't seem to by implying that you have to disclose your wallet addresses to the government and register them to you *yet*.

That was a big part of the Patriot Act though, that the US gov didn't want anonymous bank accounts or bank accounts given to people who were not US residents. I had to open one as a foreign national in the past, and they made me give my passport + proof of address.

You have to guess they would like to get to that point again, but this bill *may* fall short due to it's broad nature.

It actually does a lot to legitimize BTC as a viable financial tool. You see, any banks that touch international money transfers of any kind have to do a ton of AML footwork. 

They mostly don’t want to touch BTC because how AML laws operate with respect to BTC was not defined, and therefore they couldn’t safely do anything with it.

This signals that major institutions said “Hey Diane, write up some basic, bare-bones AML rules for cryptocurrency so we can freaking accept it, trade it, and offer exchanges for it, ok?”.

"Roading Infrastructure in Guatemala 
 0
By Eliza Gresh on December 8, 2017 
World News
BORGEN writer Eliza Gresh spent some time volunteering for Habitat for Humanity in Guatemala almost a decade ago. While there, in a village alongside the mountains near Anguilla. she helped a family to construct what would become their home.
GUATEMALA CITY — Guatemala is a country full of movement, color and vibrancy. The people are welcoming and the culture exudes from the indigenous people that make up nearly half the population. The infrastructure in Guatemala builds from the establishments of early settlers and the indigenous population. After traveling to the country almost 10 years ago, I remember remarkable differences between infrastructural capabilities throughout the country.
From one city to the next, the infrastructural capabilities varied along the landscape made up of 82 percent slopes and highlands. As a Habitat for Humanity volunteer, my job was to contribute to the infrastructure in Guatemala. My team and I worked on building a home in a small village on the side of a mountain. Our van left the city on paved streets but, once it neared the village, streets were unpaved and narrow.
Much of the road infrastructure in Guatemala is a maze of dirt and paved streets maneuvering over mountains and culminating at cities. Of the 17,621 kilometers of roads in Guatemala, nearly three-quarters are unpaved. The small village where we were stationed exemplified the need for paved roads in Guatemala.
The nearby city where we were staying, Antigua, was a different situation. Once the capital of Guatemala, and famous for its Spanish colonial buildings, Antigua has a sufficient amount of historic roadways and paved streets. The majority of routes to and from Antigua were established during Spanish reign and paved over time to uphold Antigua’s tourist appeal. In fact, much of Guatemala’s road infrastructure is centered in cities.
The lack of infrastructure connecting Guatemala’s large cities to the rest of the country has negatively affected public and private investments. The World Bank has called Guatemala the biggest economy in Central America. Yet, according to the International Monetary Fund, “At less than 1 percent of GDP, public infrastructure investment in Guatemala is among the lowest in Latin America.”
In 2016, the Guatemalan government presented its portfolio of infrastructure projects to local and foreign investors in search of funding solutions. Antigua is the subject of one of the 150 proposed infrastructure projects, worth $1.6 billion. The plans also aim to raise Guatemala’s infrastructure related rankings with the International Trade Center. Amongst 148 countries, The International Trace Centre ranks Guatemala at 78 in the overall quality of infrastructure and 82 in the quality of roads.
I still remember the slanted village along the mountain near Antigua. The faces of the children running around the local store and the communal strength of a village helping a family build a home were inspiring. The cultural identity maintained by the indigenous population draws investors to villages outside of cities. A foreign investor invited us to see his new construction a few meters above the village in which we were building a home. His experience in the country encouraged him to build a home and stimulate the local economy.
Although my visit was 10 years ago, infrastructure advancements were visible then, even in rural areas. As the country with the lowest tax revenue to GDP ratio in Latin America — 12 percent — Guatemala relies on foreign investments. The projects currently in the pipeline require investments to be fulfilled and to advance Guatemala’s development outside of the larger cities.

"S1241 is unlikely to pass in its current form (we hope!) not least because it creates at least one ""perverse incentive"". For instance, it turns ordinary tax fraud that does NOT involve criminal proceeds, into ""money laundering"" - hitherto a much more serious offense. People who are vulnerable to the lesser charge may as well commit a more serious crime in an attempt to cover their tracks; the penalty won't be any worse. 

In principle, treating Bitcoin and Ether like ordinary money, or gold, is not necessarily a bad thing. But to conflate the holding of these assets with criminal activity, which some people do, is both stupid and dangerous (to many of us here). Even hodlers in Europe and other countries outside the US are at risk as there are specific provisions for accessing foreign bank statements. 

This is a Bill that needs to be watched closely.

"If anything, acknowledging and codifying the new frontiers that Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency unlock grant us a legitimacy that we need for the market to stabilize. 

Yes, this bill confirms that tax evasion and money laundering are illegal in the United States. If any Americans believed that our government would just throw up their hands to Crypto because it's anonymous and difficult to trace they are outside of their minds.

The US Government wants their cut of ALL financial transactions that take place in it's country or among it's citizens. They require taxes to be paid on illegal gambling profit, money made while working in a foreign country, and on any other tangential example you can think of. If I find a hundred dollar bill lying in the middle of the street the US Gov't wants me to declare it on my income taxes as short term capital gains. 

This is kind of a drag, but it's preposterous to have assumed that the government would not react to tax all financial transactions that they feel lie within their jurisdiction.

"Is everyone here really bothered about the fact that the IRS already asked you if you have foreign bank accounts?

I think it's pretty standard practice for your government to want to know your assets so that they can tax you.

Bitcoin is an asset and I don't really see the difference between asking if you have a foreign bank account and asking if you have Bitcoin. Has Obama famously said Bitcoin is like a miniature digital Swiss bank account in your pocket.

If it bothers you that the IRS asks about foreign bank accounts when you do your taxes then it would not be hypocritical for you to be bothered by this change of terminology in this bill. 

I think it's an important time to remind everyone that Bitcoin was not created for tax evasion. There is not a single reference in the white paper or any Bitcointalk posts by Satoshi that talks about evading taxes.

The only real ideological purpose that we know for Bitcoin is to eliminate Central entities from controlling monetary policy. That's it.

"I don't agree that this toxic copy-paste from a known ""anti-jew bank"" forum should be allowed to go to frontpage reddit, even with your clarification. It is FUD-mongering.

Never mind that this copy-paste strips out all of the contextual links to the speaking, the actual laws, and the source of the horribly editorialized version you see above. Funny that. This was reposted a few times and it's odd that this version was the one that caught traction... anyhoo, I littered up the comments below posting those links and a verbose eye-cancer version, that you've nicely formatted and responded with here. Thanks for that, at least.

"The bill is not saying it is illegal to buy or own digital currencies.  However it attempts to liken digital currencies to cash, which is already subject to government seizure via civil asset forfeiture if law enforcement authorities ""believe"" said cash could have been used in some unspecified crime at some point.  The person whose property is seized does not need to be charged with, or convicted of, any crime whatsoever.  To make it worse, state and local law enforecement in the past (this goes back to the 1980s) has had an incentive to seize people's assets because they have been permitted to liquidate those assets and use the funds.  People who have had their cash or property seized include many who were simply transporting cash (not even always more than $10K) and people running cash based businesses (eg. convenience stores, etc) who made regular large cash deposits to their bank accounts.

">Exactly, there is no way they can hold the bitcoin water by squeezing their fist. Nobody, no individual and no central power or government can control, manipulate, ban, hack or kill a worldwide distributed open-source peer-to-peer cryptographically secured decentralised system.

You are not considering the influence of developer consensus.

Let's say some developers of a coin realize people like the coin.  They realize people keep using the coin and that their main form of monetary gain off of it is to make money on in/out process of fiat and coin exchanges - similar to what the IRS does with various securities and assets.

Let's say they get greedy over time.  Let's say they realize they can collude with major miners who control huge portions of the network.  Slow down the network.  Drive up fees.  Offer an alternate solution, an off-chain network that makes everything go super fast!  You don't pay a premium now, but there's no reason you won't later to cover costs for this and that - and hold on, now you have another conglomerate of developer consensus to deal with on the off-chain network.  One group already devolved into typical behavior of humans in control, and now they're going to let others in on it?  Also consider that the government, while it can't easily track on-chain transactions... off-chain is an entirely different story.  You get off the chain, you get off decentralization, you allow exploitation just like it's always been since before there was cryptocurrency in the first place.";1;0;False;Herculix;dqyoetv;Us Senate Bill S.1241 to criminalize concealed ownership of Bitcoin;7iey6q;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7iey6q/us_senate_bill_s1241_to_criminalize_concealed/

The only people who use crypto for money laundering are people who are desperate to have dollars, they don't believe in Bitcoin and they are still dumb enough to believe in the fiat dollar and it's actual value.  Soon BTC (the closest thing to CURRENCY we've had in  hundreds of years) will be accepted everywhere right alongside dollars or MONEY, so you never have to turn it into cash or U.S.D. so they won't be taxing anything but normal sales taxes. And that amount is state by state.  The money launderers do have something to hide, and they didn't realize Bitcoin isn't totally anonymous.  But only wallets that do shady shit even get considered for investigation.  There is just way too much transaction volume for them to even keep up with let alone go back and audit the past, the IRS just does not have the manpower to enforce it, at least at this point in time..;1;1;False;lightwithin87;dqyy6qr;Us Senate Bill S.1241 to criminalize concealed ownership of Bitcoin;7iey6q;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7iey6q/us_senate_bill_s1241_to_criminalize_concealed/

"Coin Center is aware of this and is working to oppose it. However it's worth noting that the bill would not change the current treatment of cryptocurrency, and is actually just redundant with existing guidance. 

""The first thing the bill would do is add ""issuer, redeemer, or cashier of ... digital currency ... or any digital exchanger or tumbler of digital currency"" to the BSA’s definition of ""financial institution,"" thus bringing these under BSA coverage. However, FinCEN’s intervening 2013 guidance made clear that these persons are already considered MSBs, and thus ""financial institutions,"" making this section of S. 1241 bill redundant with current law. Furthermore, if this language were to remain in S. 1241 it would introduce a lot of confusion by creating new language and categorizations that would now be incompatible with FinCEN's guidance, administrative rulings, and the years of compliance efforts that have emerged around that guidance.""

1.) The government is very good at tracking financial transactions, like when you try to convert between dollars and bitcoins, and they can criminalize services which facilitate this.

2.) It is easy to track what's bought with bitcoin, and you can track where it ends up; Meaning bitcoin is only good for black market purchases.

3.) Gov doesn't even try to prevent Bitcoin, but severely penalizes those that get caught, like tax evasion.

here are some scenarios

1 ""decentalized""? unfortunately the flaw in the bitcoin protocol encourages centralization of the miners into pools, just as it exists today. governments can (and probably will, if they haven't already) attack the miners. without miners, no transactions, or only selected transactions, get processed. 

2 the government declares it illegal and criminalizes it. then people stop using it out of fear. sure bitcoin won't die fully, but that will put a huge weight to overcome

"#STOP SPREADING THIS FUD

I've seen this cross posted **4 times** in the last 3 days now, and it is all based on the same misinterpretation.

This is literally a copy pasta from this blog post: https://btcmanager.com/us-senate-bill-s-1241-criminalize-concealed-ownership-bitcoin/ I don't think EaFaer = Landon Mutch, and I don't get why THIS POST got all the traction when I've seen it over and over again.


""“criminalize [those] intentionally concealing ownership or control of a [digital currency or digital exchange] account.” Wow. Let this sink in for a minute…"" **BULLSHIT.**



""If you’ve already watched the hearing, watch it again, but this time replace all mentions of ‘banks and financial institutions’ with ‘digital currencies and digital exchanges.’ The implications are really rather alarming."" **NOWHERE DOES IT STATE REPLACE ANYTHING WITH DIGITAL CURRENCIES. IT IS ONLY BANKS w/EXCHANGES.


##""The bill criminalizes intentionally concealing ownership or control of a bank account.” was the ACTUAL QUOTE.

https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/meetings/s1241-modernizing-aml-laws-to-combat-money-laundering-and-terrorist-financing


That's it.

Bank account would be amended to include ""accounts on an exchange.""





“§ 5333. Prohibition on concealment of ownership of account



**(a) In General.—No person shall knowingly conceal, falsify, or misrepresent, or attempt to conceal, falsify, or misrepresent, from or to a financial institution, a material fact concerning the ownership or control of an account or assets held in an account with a financial institution.**

I mean, obviously.

They're equating crypto exchanges with foreign bank accounts. you can't just hide money there.... well, you can, but it's already illegal to do so.

Again, this is about INSTITUTIONS/ACCOUNTS not ""crypto holdings.""

...
SEC. 13. PREPAID ACCESS DEVICES, DIGITAL CURRENCIES, OR OTHER SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS. (a) In General.—Section 5312(a) of title 31, United States Code, is amended—
(1) in paragraph (2)(K)—
(A) by inserting “prepaid access devices, digital currency,” after “money orders,”; and
(B) by inserting before the semicolon at the end the following: “, or any digital exchanger or tumbler of digital currency”;

https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/31/5312 (K) an issuer, redeemer, or cashier of travelers’ checks, checks, money orders, or similar instruments;

so they're taking it out of context of ISSUER, REDEEMER or CASHIER.

TLDR: having a bitcoin wallet does not make you a bank.

Again, you wouldn't have to report your holdings, you'd have to report your holdings ON AN EXCHANGE.
So basically get the fuck out of here with this clickbait FUD.

the actual quote was:

https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/meetings/s1241-modernizing-aml-laws-to-combat-money-laundering-and-terrorist-financing

“criminalizes intentionally concealing ownership or control of a bank account.”

That's the quote, not this horseshit from the link:

https://btcmanager.com/us-senate-bill-s-1241-criminalize-concealed-ownership-bitcoin/

“criminalize [those] intentionally concealing ownership or control of a [digital currency or digital exchange] account.” Wow. Let this sink in for a minute…

Wow, learn to read you fucking wingding. Not sure what the agenda is here but please just think for yourself, this shitpost swapped bank with ""digital currency"" ... lol. And look at all the rabid claiming ""how dumb must the government be that they would even try!"" Obviously.

The speech: https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/meetings/s1241-modernizing-aml-laws-to-combat-money-laundering-and-terrorist-financing

The lie on btc manager: “criminalize [those] intentionally concealing ownership or control of a [digital currency or digital exchange] account.” Wow. Let this sink in for a minute…

This has nothing to do with criminalizing crypto

In fact, these laws seem good to me -- and some of the least repulsive I've seen -- as their intent is weeding out nasty crime. The problem is when the law overreaches and can be used to suppress things that are not at all equivalent, etc.

"I've always interpreted it to mean - ""don't invest based on emotion (& following the market swings), invest based on rational evaluation of price to value"".  

Which means - don't invest in Pets.com in 1999 just because it's the Dot Com boom and everyone's throwing money at anything ""on the internet"". 

It also means - invest in well-run banks, newspapers and railroads that have good business fundamentals, but that everyone's running away from because they are so ""last century"".

This is untrue. The US has had a half dozen major currency iterations in its short lifetime. We are a complicated and finicky people. We are not stable  (that's not necessarily a bad thing). But I wholeheartedly believe that you will see a major money paradigm shift in your lifetime if you are younger than 40. Fiat currency has an average lifespan of 70 years and we are dangerously close, on all financial fronts, to a necessary reset of our currency and others around the world.

"""That's the stuff that money cannot buy"".

I call pure bullshit on this. If you don't have enough money to spend time with someone anywhere but in a fucking cardbox in bushes then it doesn't matter who you are with, it's fucking shit.

You can't learn for free unless you literally run through public libraries looking for information. What are you gonna tell me, that internet is free? Well what are you gonna use to connect to that free internet for free? Your fucking stone with a stick? Or a computer/phone you had to buy?

What about traveling? I can barely get to another town, explore the fucking world? With what money? Am I supposed to ""explore it"" on my feet?

All these fucking things is what money buys, if I had money oh believe me, I would for sure be exploring world right now and not arguing about nothing on a fucking reddit with my potato laptop.

Money can't fucking buy this my ass. Try getting food without any money, I dare you, you can't be fucking happy if you are starving or fucking dead.

People who fucking have money and can't even appreciate the fact that they have it and say that money doesn't fucking matter, even though they wouldn't really be as happy if they didn't have any piss me off more than anything else. It doesn't fucking matter how much money you have, there's never enough, because all excess can be put to charity and even if that won't make you as happy as being able to travel around the world and being secure for the rest of your life financially, it will make you feel just a little bit better that you help out those who weren't as lucky as you are, you fucking ungrateful piece of shit.";1;0;False;PurpleIcy;dqy9hvx;My brother killed himself because of BTC;7hmjdw;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7hmjdw/my_brother_killed_himself_because_of_btc/

it's one thing to go all-in on some stock and hold it for a long time. yeah, you might miss the peak. you can always hold it longer. but if you buy a shitpile of call options, and you miss the peak, they typically crash to zero. and then they vanish come expiration. at least with a stock, you still have SOMETHING in your portfolio when it crashes. it might go below where you bought it, representing a loss... but at least you can still sell it all for something. when you fuck up and let your options expire, you're just fucked.

Watching everyone talk about the money they could have made in cryptocurrencies (esp bitcoin) has been interesting, because normal people in the non financial world are realizing they missed an opportunity. What's crazy is that almost every day there's stocks increase 100%, so very hypothetically you could pretty much double your money every day if you knew which stock was about increase. It's the same as the cryptos, in that there wasn't enough information present at the time to realize what will happen in the future. This FOMO and regret of not making money is especially interesting to me because people treat it as a new and unique opportunity. If people only knew how much hypothetical profits in the stock market they could be making, they'd realize that this crypto craze is nothing new, and that they shouldn't feel bad about it.  ;1;0;False;immenseplays;dqyekfq;My brother killed himself because of BTC;7hmjdw;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7hmjdw/my_brother_killed_himself_because_of_btc/

"that's not really fair. options exist as insurance. they exist so that you can own several hundred shares of some underlying stock, and then in times of uncertainty, you can use options as a way to lock in potential profits (or lock a maximum possible loss) in advance in case things get weird. 

now, playing with options for stuff that you do not already own... that's a different story. you're essentially trading insurance policies on assets that you don't have. like buying fire insurance for your neighbor's house for like a couple months at a time and just hoping that somewhere in there, it burns to the ground and you can collect the payout. 

consider that you own 100 shares of CompanyA stock that you bought at $80/share. you've had it for a few years and it's now at $100. you obviously want it to go up forever, and keep holding it. but we know that's not how life works. it might go down. who knows... it might never go back up to any given level ever again. So you could sell a call against your 100 shares at $120. you collect a little cash for it, and if it goes over $120, you lose out on a little profit, but you'd then end up selling your whole 100 shares at that price, which is still a big profit from where you originally bought them. Alternatively, you could buy a put at $90, so that if the stock keeps going up, nothing happens and spent a little cash to own that put. but if it crashes, say to $70/share, which would be a loss on your whole 100 shares, you would have the right to sell them all at $90/share which would have locked in a $10/share profit over where you bought them several years ago. insurance. 

sure, you can go in and bet all your money on black and just buy call options with the hope that they become more valuable in the next 3 weeks before they expire, but that's just degenerate speculation/gambling. that's how you lose a lot of money in a very short time.

That was kind of the mistake. NO ONE CAN PREDICT THE MARKET. I promise you this. People who claim to be able to are scam artists.

You still have a nice chunk of change. Tell you what to do: put all of it into a few low cost index funds and about 10% of it into bond funds. Then let it sit for many years. That's it.

"Very sad to hear for your loss and your brother having such a difficult time dealing with his situation. If he was hacked, that would be a very difficult thing to deal with mentally especially when you're relatively young and have no obvious path towards reconciliation. It may be too early to tell... but was he in debt? Debt would be a much larger mental weight than simply losing money and having to restart at zero.

If he sold them too early, the fact is he never would have made the kind of money that he drove himself mad over missing. Looking back and doing the math on 'what if i held' is nothing but a flawed form of thinking, because this is not a binary one time 'what if' question.

A binary 'what if' question when you wish you could change one decision at one particular point in time that isn't a re-occuring possibility. ""If I didn't punch that dude, I wouldn't have been arrested."" ""If I didn't take the wrong turn, I wouldn't have got lost in the woods.""  The reason why this question is different is because the 'what if' in this case is when to sell, could have happened at essentially an infinite number of times and price points between then and now. It's not a binary question, it's a constantly reoccurring possibility that occurs over and over at every minute of every day. Because if the nature of that type of question, the probability of your 'what if' scenario quickly approaches zero.

I had 4 BTC that I bought early 2016 that I bought around $200-$400 and sold at varying prices around $1000. I sold them because they had gone up so much, and it was a right thing for me to do at the time. I don't beat myself over not holding 4BTC today, because I never would have ever held them to this point. I would have sold when it hit $2k, I would have sold when it hit $3k, I would have sold when it hit $5k, and so on. Maybe I should have held onto 1BTC just to be in on the ride, but even then I bet you I would have sold that last one too at 7K.

"I know exactly how this feels. I was 20 years old when I took over managing my own investments. Went heavily into TASR stock starting around 2002 or 2003. Turned $10 into $350k. Back down to $50k. Doubled down and got it back to $350k. Then took all that out and put it into a company nobody ever heard of, Raser (ticker RZ, figured it rhymed with Taser so it had to be another home run investment in the making). 

In a few months, my RZ stock spiked up and, for just a few hours, I was a 22 year old college student with $1,000,000 in my Etrade account. I thought, ""Should I sell? Or what if this is just the beginning of the real run up, like I experienced with TASR? If I sell, I'll owe ~$400k in short term capital gains taxes. Plus, I'm smart, obviously. Let's turn this $1M into $10M and retire!"". 

By the end of that day, the stock was already back down about 30-40% from it's intra-day high. But that was okay, that meant I still had about $600k. Long story short, two years later it was worth $10k. A year after that, $0.

The reason BTC are worth so much for long term holders is only because **there are so few long term holders**. Every single person thinks that *they* should have been a part of that 0.001% of insane maniacs who refused to sell their BTC. 

But the truth is, by the simple fact that they **no longer have their BTC** is *proof* that they are not one of those people.

So kicking yourself over something that was never going to happen anyways is a waste of time.

"From what I've read about it, the fees are basically zero until it touches the block chain -- which would either result in a large decrease in the number of miners, or high transaction fees for the few times the block chain is used for a transaction. Great for users buying and selling stuff, but if the number of ""miners"" (not really, once all bitcoin are mined) is too low then you lose the security of a large network (which is probably way too big at the moment).

I guess there is some money to be made by running a lightning network node, but it sounds like the per transaction fee is very small, so I imagine profit would be low unless someone is able to gain a large number of transactions routed through their node.

If you found a good write up that that presents an alternate point of view, then post a link.";1;0;False;Nightlark192;dqxmgnm;$15,000 Bitcoin Breached!;7i5f3w;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7i5f3w/15000_bitcoin_breached/

The risk–return spectrum (also called the risk–return tradeoff or risk–reward) is the relationship between the amount of return gained on an investment and the amount of risk undertaken in that investment. The more return sought, the more risk that must be undertaken.

"I understand that there is a finite source of it. 

I'm saying that the paper money we earn and use to buy goods is essentially worth nothing. If the economy collapses, the value of the dollar would crash and wouldn't be able to buy you much of anything.

Before 1933, the only reason paper ""money"" had any value was because you could exchange it for gold. Since then, its essential sentimental paper that people SEE value in. It's no different than saying an old baseball card is worth $1000. Effectively, it is just a piece of paper with ink on it and it's only worth what someone would pay for it. There is only a finite amount of those cards out there, but the only value is what someone sees in that object.

While gold (or other precious metals) is also a finite resource, it's physical nature means you can use it for a variety of things.

""Just go with it man"" isn't really a convincing argument.

"No offense, but I can tell you don't have a lot of experience. Not saying I know it all, but I'm just gonna tell you what I think.

You're right when you say Bitcoin supply has a limit. And up to now buyers have obviously been increasing, thus the price went up. You can't talk for the future, but yes you can make an educated guess. Aka  buyers are gonna keep increasing.

I'm not saying buying btc right now is necessarily a bad choice. Just saying you don't know the force behind the current rise in value.

Let's talk about motivation. Why do people buy btc? Most people? Because they think the value will increase. But people are limited, so at some point, the price will have to stagnate if I'm right about most people buying it for future expectations. And then people will stop buying, and sell. The losers are those who bought at the highest point.

You nor anyone knows when people are gonna stop buying.";1;0;False;w2g;dqxy09v;1 BTC = $16,000!!! Absolutely Insane!;7i6p4a;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7i6p4a/1_btc_16000_absolutely_insane/

"IOTA spiked like crazy, more than doubled in a day on the 5th. Capped at around ~$5.00 and then the correction came through and IOTA crashed all the way down to nearly $2.00. Pricing is subjective to the exchange you're using.

I guess a lot of people started panic selling. Didn't really help when the price kept going lower and lower and lower and people started getting concerned that the pricing was going to crash even lower to before IOTA announced a partnership with Microsoft.

Most investors right now don't ever intend to use it as a currency and big vendors are rolling back on accepting it already.

I’m feeling the pain. I held mine since 2013 through the lows. It got above $7k a few weeks ago — so fast was the rise, I traded it all for ether. That went up $150 so I thought I was good, and then Bitcoin kept going up while Ether has been going down. It’s been a tough week watching for that correction that hasn’t come — and having to momentarily root against Bitcoin. But if Bitcoin corrects it could send a massive amount of money into alts, so maybe Ether will shoot up, then I’ll diversify into bitcoin and a maybe one or two others. ;1;0;False;truguy;dqxivpm;1 BTC = $16,000!!!

"So, BTC futures are worth what people think they're going to be worth, but people who speculate on futures tend to be pessimists because (generally) if an asset/share is at an all-time high it's reasonable to presume that a drop will come once the buzz dissipates.

Nowadays, BTC doesn't really pump because of news - it's being adopted because of the news, the brand, network effect, word-of-mouth.

If the guys interested in speculating on BTC's futures buy (or get their friends to buy on their behalf so it doesn't get traced back to them) a lot of BTC before futures speculation begins, they can lay large margin-leveraged bets to the tune of millions of dollars on the futures market that BTC will drop below a certain point. Let's say a 10x margin-leveraged bet that it goes down.

If they've taken note of how much BTC it would take to make everybody else's stop-losses activate and cascade downwards (flash crash) they can sell their BTC below that market value at just the right time for it to collapse, hit below the point where they said it would on the futures market and they get to win their bet.

If they bet $10m that BTC would drop below a certain level with 10x leverage and it does that, they've just earned $100m on the futures market.

They can also start buying the cheap BTC if they have the cash to buy it from the bottom.

"~100%-200% growth over a 2-3 year span to about 2-3k. And that's accounting for it's propensity to swing wildly.

This isn't natural growth.  It would imply more people have bought more bitcoin in the last month, than in it's entire history.

And considering even now it's swinging wildly up and down in the 10% range by the hour I am significantly more convinced this is highly emotional market money chasing a bubble, than that it is the result of legitimate adoption.

In August I thought is was adoption growth, In September I changed my mind,  by November I was convinced that this was a bubble that was unsustainable in the long run, and now I feel pretty sure that a lot of people with a lot of money have lost their fucking minds, that' or really don't like money very much.";1;0;False;N3bu89;dqy6n2j;1 BTC = $16,000!!!

"Mmm yeah I know what you mean, and I think that is a big benefit is the hope for quicker and cheaper transactions that credit cards can't provide and that will be interesting to see how the technology all plays out with the transaction fees.

And are you proposing that banks may create their own blockchain system for transferring money between themselves sorta thing and then maybe they hold our keys or something? That would be interesting and I guess.

I also was just talking the other day about how the ownership mentality has either shifted from the modern age or was taken from us through higher prices, but it seems like everyone is getting more and more comfortable just renting things rather than owning them and I think bitcoin allows for that sense of control and ownership that is lacking in many other places. Things like renting homes being more common, or renting cars and other technology for periods of time like a cell phone from your phone provider having a set contract. Someone even brought up how people are more okay with renting music sorta through spotify rather than owning the songs whether that's a CD or .mp3 file.

I guess I'm just saying that I can see that people don't seem to mind the idea of someone else controlling some aspect of their life so long as its cheaper or more convenient- maybe not a bad thing but just a different mentality from the ownership generations we've seen years before ";2;0;False;ZeeBeast;dqxoxcv;NEWCOMERS.

No its not....  thats why for example in many small shops in Europe you need to buy a minum amount to use credit cards...

Theres a reason the US became a financial center(half of their economy is financial services), if you control how/where the money moves you can earn unlimited amounts because you basially put paywalls in every transaction....

Diversification is the name of the game.

Plus I think the average life of fiat currencies is around 37 years and every single one of them has died due to the same problems: hyperinflation and overprinting...

Clearly you missed all the points listed before. Again roads are not built through income tax. Second, Taxation is theft. If I do not pay taxes, men will show up with guns and take it from me. That is theft. Basic education has been around without taxation. Clearly you are delusional if you think 80% tax rate on corporations would benefit the population. Im done with this conversation as I don't think you even remotely understand economics to not get what I mean by corporations don't pay taxes. I mean they pass the added cost to the consumer. You can post again, but like I said before, we have philosophical differences. Only problem is your belief is forced on my by governments guns. Finally roads are not even built by government, government is just the middle man. Society and the free market has solved way more difficult problems than how to fund the construction of roads(BTW hint the first freeways in the United States were paid for voluntarily by companies).

"Difficulty has started climbing again though it doesn't look to be going up very fast.

That said, there are about to be >100 million watts of mining power added to the network next year, probably more like 200Mw. That's an insane amount of power and would push the difficulty up past the point where S9 or DragonMint would be very profitable (might just barely break even).

Unfortunately there aren't any more S9s to be had right now either, and also the power reqs on em are pretty insane (1400W/5.5A).

I love mining and right now I really wish I could buy a ton of good miners and just have em show up right now, but there just aren't any options.

DragonMint looked like an option, but not shipping until April with pre-orders live *now* means that you'd probably lose a ton of gains, and also get your miner *right* when the massive 200Mw datacenters come online, spiking the difficulty a ton.

Right now I'm hoping that by the time GMO Internet's 7nm miners come out (if at all), the difficulty will still be decently low enough to make them feasible, even in large numbers.

"Your post is has multiple statements that are incredibly false. The first thing I would like to point out is you claim I said I must select the evil of my side. I never said that. You assumed it. I said both are responsible for horseshit which I definitely did and they are definitely. So you are saying Democrats are not to blame for the state of our country? Our perpetual warfare? How about the insane amounts of spending on the welfare state leading to our inflationary currency? You don't think they have part to blame? Are you really that blinded by cognitive dissonance? You don't think that all these welfare programs and insane spending don't add to our financial woes of our country, that don't help get individuals out of poverty but rather trap them there? And you say nonsensee about anti progress but often times, these attempts at progress hinder it. You don't think the trillion dollar stimulus was a handout for crony capitalism? The trillion dollar Affordable care act? Those are handouts to big corporations at the expense of the taxpayer, you just like them because they pretend to have good intentions. They aren't banning Muslims, not that I approve of the travel bans. Obama expanded on bush's policies, the patriot act, drone strikes, the number of countries we were at war with(declared or not). Stop pretending that both sides aren't guilty. Also, you can't say ""Republicans are racist"" sure some probably are, but if you don't think some democrats are too you are fooling yourself. Keep making excuses all you want for the democrats, but the reality is they are no more pro freedom than the republicans. Again you are assuming and stating that I support republicans when I clearly stated they are responsible for plenty of wrong doing. We have philosophical differences on rights. I do not think the government has special rights of theft and kidnapping, but they granted it to themselves. I don't think groups have rights, only individuals. I don't believe the government has any business in healthcare, in marriage, the bedroom, gun laws, etc. You can argue all you want, but that will not change. The government gets its ability to act, through the delegation of action from the people to it. Therefore if the people do not have the right to commit theft, kidnapping or murder, neither does the government. Therefore I think taxation is immoral and wrong. I think inflation is wrong, it is why bitcoin exists, and without inflation the welfare/warfare state can't exist. Keep defending corrupt politicians because they say warm fuzzies about minorities and women, promise free shit in return for votes. ";1;0;False;FlPumilio;dqydsha;NEWCOMERS.

Also, you claim tax cuts are antihumanism? Thats insane. Taxes are theft. I don't care if its rich or poor.

The first time it hit $400 it was EXACTLY like this and it went up to $1200 in a short period just like this and then BOOM it dropped fast!!!  I'm willing to bet that is not the time that you bought in and more likely it was within the last couple of years.  You have no idea what you're in for...the most you have seen was the big selloff a month ago and that wasn't that bad and it corrected back up within a day.  If by ride out the storm you mean HODL for 5 years then maybe you might be on to some sound advice but not a lot of people here will have the balls to do that if it loses 60%+ in a short time period.;2;1;False;Qwertster;dqxudew;NEWCOMERS.

"As an Australian, our smallest unit of cash is 5c. In my mind, this represents a functional limit for the largest value a Satoshi could hold. (If a Satoshi was worth $1, it would be hard to give change/make small payments).

So, given that there are 100,000,000 Satoshis in one Bitcoin, if each was worth 5c, one Bitcoin would be about $5M AUD, which is probably about $4M USD.

Unless there is a separate currency for small change, Bitcoin won't be able to exceed this value without losing utility.

Edit: that limit would be $1M USD, if we choose the US penny as our maximum Satoshi value, although I think pennies probably offer marginal utility...

Because we have been waiting for a correction since 10k and it hasn't happened except for a small dip to 9k. The reality is that the media coverage of BTC has attracted a lot of individual waiting for a dip to invest and so whenever the market is heading towards a correction or a downtrend, a lot of money is put back into the market by new investors.

"The simple fact is that if you are scared to lose money, don't invest it. When I put my first $50 in I was at peace with the fact that I might not ever see that $50 again. I did the same thing with my next $50. And so on.

Tonight I decided I've risked enough. I sold just enough btc to get back all of my investments plus enough to take my wife and I out to a nice dinner. What's left can either rise or fall - even if it bottoms out to zero I've still not lost any money and I got a free dinner out of it. If it rises, I'll be happy that I protected myself against loss instead of thinking ""OH MAN I SHOULD HAVE JUST HELD IT ALL INSTEAD"". Plus if it dips, I can always re-invest what I just took out if I change my mind and decide to be back in it with risk.

My suggestion to you, if you do invest, is to wait until it doubles. If it does that, take your principle out and let the rest of your bitcoin experience be fueled by what's left - free investment. Of course my first point stands - if you can't afford to lose that initial completely, don't do it.";7;1;False;TSTC;dqxkuxt;NEWCOMERS. Don't be worried if we see a $6000-$7000 correction soon.

If you want to get in for the first time but are nervous, then just take whatever amount of money you want to spend and divide it into two or three buys that are a few days to a week apart. That way if it moves down, you can lower your average buy in, and if it moves up, your average will still be below whatever the current price is and you won't feel like you bought at a top. Really helps take the edge off jumping in for the first time. After that, you can just add to your position every week or month or whatever. ;1;0;False;Sharlach;dqxo25j;NEWCOMERS.

"It's traditionally a strategy used to minimize potential loss when investing a large sum.

Let's say you wanted to invest $200k into a stock (let's ignore whether or not that's a good financial plan for this example). You are worried that if you put that $200k in right now the price might correct on you and then you're starting your portfolio down at a huge loss.

So instead you invest $20k every week for 10 weeks. The value will inevitably change each week. Some weeks may be higher than when you first started, some lower. The idea is that over the longer period of time, the average between all of these highs and lows will be closer to zero than how much you could potentially lose in one go.";3;0;False;TSTC;dqxl748;NEWCOMERS.

"I only had a little bit of money in my bank account but I went ahead and invested a couple hundred.

If I invest any more, then I'll start panicking.

I think the trick is to invest *as much as possible* up to the point where you feel it would be financially crippling to invest any more. If it's chump change for you, invest $1,000.

"One real reason the volatility of Bitcoins price is not a good thing -- the fact that it really makes investing in alt coins very difficult. If the price would stabilize then people would stop moving their coins back and forth from alts to Bitcoin and alt coins might actually go up instead of just spiking now and then and then plummeting. 

ETH and Litecoin isn't doing so well and nearly every time that I look at TradingView 20 or so alt coins on my list are just doing very badly. Usually there's 1-3 that are doing alright when the rest are diving. 

Just seems like until things stabilize with all this insanity lately that alt coins just aren't going to really move up healthily and be worth anything talking about.

It's getting depressing sometimes, waiting for Bitcoin to stop going up. Even if it's making me money. I want to see alt coins start doing well and stop suffering from it.";2;0;False;Marikc1;dqy10iv;Reasons why these price increases are NOT a good thing. no FUD, all facts.;7ia5w2;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7ia5w2/reasons_why_these_price_increases_are_not_a_good/

"Bitcoin will drop soon, and hard.  Will it happen at &20k?  I think so.  $20k is a milestone, and a lot of people are going to sell.  Bitcoin has become a fad over the past month; there are a ton of new buyers now, and at the first sign of trouble, they will bail.  Most of these people don’t even know, or care about what Bitcoin is or how it works.  It is being manipulated right now, and the whales are settling up an ambush.  The holders will hold, and buy more when the drop occurs.  Following that, we won’t see the gains we are seeing these days.  At least not for a while.  The people who went all in will get slaughtered, unless they got in under $6.5k.  I’m not trying to scare anyone, I’m just facing reality.  These are only my opinions, and I’m not a prophet.

I had an epiphany the other day, and I'm convinced Bitcoin is priceless. You can't put a price on this. This is the start of the new world order. The end of FIAT and the adoption of Bitcoin. The government can try to take control of bitcoin, but you can't. People taking money out from profits and putting into FIAT are fucked. They'll have to buy back into Bitcoin later when it becomes THE future of money. Bitcoin will be used for daily life. Food, housing, transportation, everything, all transaction will be in bitcoin. Peer to peer, end goal to get more satoshis, more bitcoin. Your choice to save it and let it keep growing in value, or use it for daily life. Nobody would've guessed the internet would be a thing. Maybe bitcoin is that next step forward.

I probably got a bit of brainwashed after traveling in Africa and seing people not keeping money in the bank (for mere 1% of interest) but buying cattle that will give birth to a babies and that way generate at least 25% interest per year. In that places one is often allright - fed, smiling, easy life...

My view is, Satoshi gave u something and if u vise enough you can have what ever you want without feeling bad when ""cashing"". Don't keep all eggs in same basket.  So buy house, buy flat, buy land maybe when btc is for 200k in year or two you choose to build house using those btc.

UX designer here ready to donate my services. I have a good understanding of what makes for an easy experience and my biggest concern to date is the divisibility of bitcoin and other crypto currencies. What makes fiat so handy is the nice round numbers. You can buy so many things with $1, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100. The simple, rounded numbers are just inherently easy to understand and calculate. With credit and debit use in most cases we no longer even do math to calculate change. This is just not the case with crypto currencies. I can see an argument being made for card transactions but even then an average person will have a difficult grasp on 0.000781 purchase. Sure. We can make up names for smaller nominations but even then we have far more digits to worry about. Say I use a crypto debit card how do we display price that’s easy to understand at the merchant level? Will a bag of chips be just as easy to purchase for 0.000913 of something as say ... $4? This and other issues like it bother me and make me question the whole concept of crypto as currency. I know there will be a ton of objections to my comment from people who are tech literate but there is a vast majority of people who have a difficult time even grasping bitcoin yet alone learning how to use it.;10;2;False;stackdatcheese3;dqyd5s1;Lightning is going to come really soon!

"Agreed, and I'll add, lightning **is not going to help the current situation**, at all. Lightning does not change everything, it ADDS something to Bitcoin.

The current situation is caused by people flooding to exchanges, not by people rushing to buy BigMac meals or Mochaccino. It will not help solve 95% of the current situation.

Schnorr sigs may help by allowing exchanges to setup incoming tx batches by some sort of not-yet existing service, I need to read up on it but I guess it can allow bundling of incoming tx's from separate parties, and condense their signatures into a single signature.

By the end of the day, Lightning Network is not designed to handle the current situation. It will ADD a very good functionality, but let's not get carried away. We need bigger blocks and hopefully it will be added alongside of meaningful additions like Schnorr.

"> And plus, lightning isn't going to be **as** useful for **one off** transactions, so those will still need to be handled on-chain.

FTFY. Value of the currency being exchanged isn't a big determining factor for usability; some very large transactions can benefit from being done through payment channels (If making a large purchase, a ""down payment"" could be put down first by the buyer, then the goods exchanged, then the final amount, which adds more security for whoever goes first in that exchange. Also, if the channel is left open for a short while after, it can be used as an option to return/refund some or all of the cost if an issue arises).

Any payment that is currently done as a one-off payment between parties who will likely never transact again, and does not benefit from being broken down into smaller pieces, and there's no multi-hop payment channels already open that connect those two parties will not benefit from the Lightning Network and would most easily (and cheaply) be done on-chain.

That will likely be a large number of transactions to start with, but the idea is the more the Lightning Network grows, that ""there's no multi-hop payment channels already open"" clause will catch more transactions, making it cheaper to do as a Lightning Network transaction.";1;0;False;MidnightLightning;dqyt3xp;Lightning is going to come really soon!

Each hop will produce some delay, right? Since each node needs to react and do somethings to forward the payment to the next node. So it's best to route the payment via only one or two always-on nodes, since an offline node can't react until its back online, right? So this means you are unlikely to route the payment via your friends or acquaintances, and more likely to route it via large nodes with lots of liquidity?

Lightning channels cost around a dollar to open and close. Your math is already off.

[Sauce, if interested](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/56611/the-cost-of-restarting-a-lightning-channel).

I honestly don't know what Blockstream's business model is, but I've never seen any information about how they will be making ill-gotten profits from creating open source software like the lightning network.
Blockstream's business model is the Liquid Network, which is a federated sidechain to be used between exchanges and large-scale Bitcoin users. Suppose you have a Coinbase account and want to pay someone with a Bitfinex account. Now suppose, Coinbase and Bitfinex are part of the Liquid Federation controlling the Liquid Network. Instead of using the Bitcoin blockchain to pay, Coinbase and Bitfinex use the Liquid Network, which is faster (since it is not mined by an anonymous set of miners, but is instead signed by a fixed set of blocksigners i.e. the Federation, it does not have to worry about block sizes and propagation delays as much as the public Bitcoin network does); so you can pay using your Coinbase account to the payee's Bitfinex account by using Coinbase and Bitfinex as intermediaries. Blockstream will be part of the Liquid Network and will get part of the fees involved in Liquid transfers. Obviously the Liquid Network will be centralized around the Liquid Federation and particularly around Blockstream; the hope was that only Liquid would centralize, with the base Bitcoin network remaining decentralized and distributed.
Notice how the above is very similar to what is commonly accused of Lightning (you need to entrust your funds to some third party which gives you IOUs (i.e. the exchanges who make up the Liquid Federation), it's a sidechain where Blockstream gets a cut of fees, it will lead to a centralized upper-layer network, etc). Many arguments against Lightning are almost entirely composed of conflations of Liquid and Lightning.
However, Lightning is different from Liquid. It was initially developed by Joseph Poon and Thaddeus Dryja /u/Dryja, both academics at MIT. At first only them academics could understand it, then Rusty Russell /u/RustyReddit got drunk, read the paper three times, then wrote a blog disassembling the whole thing for the rest of us (I am sensationalizing here). Then Blockstream hired him and told him to build Lightning, leading to the ""Reaching the ground with Lightning"" and the lightning-rfc, and the projects to implement the Lightning BOLT specs.
Lightning does not need to entrust funds to a third party: you only entrust funds to the correct operation of the Bitcoin blockchain (and if you're using Bitcoin at all, you are entrusting funds to the Bitcoin blockchain correct operation anyway). Blockstream gets no larger cut of the fees other than operating Lightning nodes that are channeled to services that users want to pay to, which any of us, in principle, can also do (unlike Liquid where membership of the Federation is by invitation only).
Blockstream has two devs working solely on Lightning (Christian Decker /u/cdecker and Rusty Russell), and 1.5 devs working solely on Bitcoin Core (Pieter Wuille /u/pwuille and Greg Maxwell /u/nullc as the 0.5 dev, since he moonlights as Blockstream's CTO when he's not trolling rbtc with his imaginary millions of sockpuppet accounts).
Lightning potentially will destroy Liquid, simply because Lightning is decentralized and has pretty low barrier-to-entry (at least when Lightning implementations get completed). Blockstream still helps build it anyway even if it could threaten their business model.";1;0;False;isriam;dqyma7e;Lightning is going to come really soon!

"> I don't think bitcoin is ready for main stream  

You are not wrong. The scalability is one issue, usability another.
 It takes quite a bit of effort just to understand how to set up a wallet and to secure your private keys (just look at the stream of uninformed people right after price rising, and now think how many more people are still out there who never even heard of reddit, who are not into tech at all etc etc).  

That being said, it all will come sooner ~~as~~ than we think. Paradigm shifts don't happen overnight, but they happen behind the backs of the uninformed masses.   

edit: also - education is super important! Even people who haven't been on board for long can educate complete noobs about basic security, why it's important to have control over your keys etc. Help out people around you who want to inform themselves!

"Honestly I'm tempted to ignore this conspiracy, and since I am a Blockstream employee people will not believe me anyway, but let's try.

Lightning is not a sidechain, which I believe the whole argument in the video hinges on. Lightning channels are an agreement between any two endpoints to establish a channel and negotiate the ownership of the funds in the channel over time. At any point in time all participants have a bitcoin transaction in their hands to settle and payout their funds on-chain. There is no central intermediary and there is no requirement for special hardware. In particular Lightning is an open-source effort that multiple companies contribute to, working on the specification and implementing clients and applications. This is by no means a Blockstream only project.

The video talks about high fees for the settlement. It is one of our goals to lighten the load on the blockchain, by settling smaller payments off-chain and only reflecting the final sums on the blockchain. The result is that there is less load on the bitcoin blockchain, and fewer transactions that compete for space in the blockchain. In addition Lightning has some other nice features like real-time payments (no need for confirmations since endpoints can always enforce the agreed upon state on-chain) and increased privacy (not every coffee transaction is reflected on-chain for eternity).

The video also talks about forcing users to adopt Lightning or Sidechains. Both are open-source technologies that anybody can implement, and adoption is opt-in based: you like the tradeoffs of a system, you're free to join, if you don't you're free to continue using what you want.

The remainder of the video basically gives away the true motivation: pushing a forked off coin as the new bitcoin. We might have ideological differences when it comes to block size, but everybody should be able to think critically about the information that is presented, and not just follow what other people say.";41;5;False;cdecker;dqyagru;Lightning is going to come really soon!

No, exchanges almost always set the fees very high. Even higher than is really necessary for fast transactions usually. I'm not sure why. Might be in case your coins are spread across many internal wallet addresses, might actually be paying all those fees, might be skimming a little off the top.

You can control that fee with your own wallet, though. If the transaction doesn't need to go through immediately, I paid less than 50 cents for a transaction a couple weeks ago.

The thing is micro-payments almost don't exist on the network because of the congestion, so LN solves a non-existing problem. In other words LN introduces _new_ possibility of micro-payments but doesn't address the current congestion.

This is an illusion of choice; if bitcoin only has 1 solution then the only choice you have is to fork the whole bitcoin and implement your own solution.

"So what you're saying is, you don't really understand how LN works?

Lightning allows users to take a single bitcoin transaction, and use it over a finite space of time, in order to shift bitcoin back and forth, with no or vanishingly small transaction fees, as iou's between what are called 'lightning channels'. The actual transaction size will be the same as a normal transaction, with a flag that says it can only be committed to the blockchain at a specific time (or block depth). In effect, these lightning transactions are cryptographically signed 'iou's. The 'thousands' of back-and-forth iou changes are discarded when the channel is closed (massive privacy dividend), and only the aggregated change is committed to the blockchain. This is the great thing about lightning. It is a single transaction with as many inputs and outputs (one/two) as defined in the original transaction. Only the transaction values change.

Consider a channel link of this : John->Bob->Sally->Anne. Only the people next to each other in the chain have a 'channel open' with each other (John/Bob, Bob/Sally, Sally/Anne). Assuming each of the channels between all of the participants have adequate funds in order to achieve this, if John wanted to send 1btc to Anne. A transaction ledger would read :

John->Bob channel : John -1btc, Bob +1btc

Bob->Sally channel : Bob -1btc, Sally +1btc

Sally->Anne channel : Sally -1btc, Anne +1btc.

Anne now has 1btc more, and John has 1btc less, but the net effect in each channel is simply a modification to the distribution of bitcoin in that channel.

Imagine this happening, back and forth, and extended to thousands, tens of thousands, and millions of people. As long as there's a chain between them, you use the chain. You might even have your transaction split over multiple chains. For links that don't have a chain, you create a channel on-the-fly.

Each channel, therefore, only ends up with the same single input, and the same two outputs, just differing values.

It's significantly more complex than that (transaction routing, and channel closure mechanics), but that's the idea. I wish I could remember the lightning dev that explained it. It really is very clever. I haven't actually questioned about the effect of having channels with multiple inputs (John/Sally) and outputs (Bob/Anne) at inception. Technically, I can't see any reason why this wouldn't be possible. Just a much weirder set of ramifications.

I would suggest that the method for creating ln channels is most likely :  Carol wants to pay Bob 0.5btc.  She creates a ln channel with 1btc, of which Bob is allocated 0.5btc, and carol is allocated 0.5btc.  Bob gets paid 0.5btc that is accessible once confirmed.  Carol has 0.5btc that is now accessible once confirmed.  That way the ln can be bootstrapped by existing txns.

I'd also suggest that it would be easier to understand if Bob were Bob Inc.  The incentive will be for the buyer to reduce txn fees.  If Carol uses a store (coffee?) she will want to reduce paying those fees.   So she creates a channel with 0.1btc and 0.001 is allocated to Bob Inc. For the coffee she buys today, coffee + txn fee.  Ever more?  Zippo txn fee.   When your channel is almost zero, you buy bitcoin, it is delivered back to you by the rebalancing of that channel. And because it's Bob Inc the path through the channels from a source of bitcoin is reduced, maybe even two hops ( exchangeA/exchangeB -> exchangeB/Bob Inc. -> Bob Inc./Carol).  

Every transaction of which is onion routed.  Even between  atomic swap enabled chains.

"I would recommend you take a look at some of the various crypto mining subs. There's usually one for every crypto coin.

Just a quick non-technical run down so you at least have a starting point. Over the last year it's been far more profitable to simply buy bitcoin and hodl than it is to buy equipment and then put it to work mining. This is mainly only true for Bitcoin and maybe 2 or 3 other coins. There are several ways available to mine depending on how you want to mine and which coin(s) you choose. Some like bitcoin, litecoin and dash can no ONLY be mined with expensive dedicated ASIC mining machines. Some are mined through proof of stake which is essentially the same principal as earning interest in a savings account. Some are mined by CPU only like vericoin. Another option is proof of capacity or hard drive mining which currently is limited to burstcoin. Some can be mined with CPU or GPU's and others like ethereum can only be mined with GPU's. Basically you'll need one or more of the following if you want to mine any coin and it be profitable.

* CPU i7 6700k or greater. You can also build a farm of single board computers for CPU mining using the Odroid XU4 or Raspberry pi 3's. 

* GPU nvidia 750ti or greater

* a large amount of one of the proof of stake coins

* 25 TB or more of HDD space that you can dedicate to mining.

So the deal with miners is you pay for the electricity but are rewarded with more than enough to pay for it. Seems like a system that could work for UBI.

"Perhaps this technology is not of use to people who transact once every 100 days or even twice every 100 days. But if they transact say, 10 times every 100 days, it looks a lot better.

This is not about making occasional, one-off use of bitcoin cheap and fast. This is about making repeated, high frequency use of bitcoin cheap and fast. You may not find much use for it, but imagine this: all exchanges, miners, and payment processors having channels. That means a lot of traffic that doesn't have to get routed through and stored forever on the blockchain. I mean, speculation is kind of much of what bitcoin is right now. It's already mostly off-chain, but a lot of the more security-conscious folks store their coins on-chain and swing trade instead of day trading. This technology will satisfy their needs as well. In fact, daytraders who use lightning-enabled exchanges would be able to keep their coins in their own wallets and only transfer back and forth the amounts they are directly trading.

If I pay someone on a channel .05 BTC for my coffee (let's pretend that's just worth $5), until that channel is closed out they can't do anything with the money, like sell it to people who aren't also on the channel. Any company that accepts BTC as payment generally wants to consolidate it into USD as quickly as possible, because if you leave that channel open for months or even days who knows if they'll get their $5, or if it will be $3 at the moment they need to balance their books. It just greatly complicates the accounting process because one day you could have $15k held up in channels, the next $10k, the next $18k. That's why all the bitcoin payment pretty much just abstract the bitcoin away from the company and from their end it's just dealt in USD.;2;1;False;;dqymi57;Lightning is going to come really soon!

"This is not the fault of the bitcoin currency though. I mean, some of it is with the transaction fees but most of the time it's heavily dictated by the exchange you are using. 

Coinbase, for example, tries to take 'advantage' of 'normal' non-savy users that decide to trade directly on coinbase, while also offering one of the cheapest ways to buy bitcoins on the market with basically 0 fees through gdax.

I put a SEPA payment to a coinbase euro wallet, 0 transaction fees, I move that money to gdax, 0 transaction fees, I add a maker (not taker) order on gdax and buy bitcoins, 0 transaction fees, I transfer the bitcoin back to my coinbase wallet, 0 transaction fees.

There are some minimal fees to transfer the bitcoin from coinbase to an external/non-coinbase wallet, but for everything else it's literally free. Furthermore, if you want to cash out your bitcoin into euro, you only have to pay 15 cents flat rate on any external bank payments, not even a % rate. Can't get cheaper than that.

"LN transaction doesn't move bitcoins, it's basically users lending money between each other while never really moving them.

It's like if I have to give Ralph money and in order to do so, you lend Ralph money and I lend it to you but nobody's really paying nor getting paid.

To make it simple, we all have, e.g., 1 Bitcoin, but cannot spend it really. Meanwhile we give cheques for that 1 Bitcoin around, which is frozen till we close the channel and we lose that Bitcoin to the last person that received it.

Problem is routing.

Since you can be a possible chequeing route between two people, you're de facto responsible for the money (cheque) that passes through you. At least in front of U.S. law.

If, e.g., you have an open channel with an exchange and U.S. government wants to track a transaction and a part of it went through you, you're responsible for it.

I honestly think it's very hard if impossible to enforce this and I don't know how easily can they track those cheques going around so you shouldn't be worried.

I feel like routing fees and scalability of LN are the first thing we need to see working and judge.

"The fact that miners are necessary is BTC's biggest risk for future dominance. PoW uses a ton of energy and lots of people seem to think it's wasted. I personally don't, but it's been shown that PoW simply isn't as necessary for decentralization as people first thought. The fact that it's not necessary to invest in hardware with a limited lifespan, a warehouse to house it, and energy to run it, is a huge risk. It also means there's a huge up-front cost to becoming a miner which is a risk to decentralization. Of course full nodes are the ones that verify transactions, but they won't be included in a block unless a miner chooses to put it into a block, so centralization of miners is dangerous.

And people that are working on ASIC-resistant PoW solutions are missing the forest for the trees and trying to solve the wrong problem.

I do think BTC dominance will continue for a while, as long as it's profitable to build warehouses full of mining rigs. But if there's a ""flippening"" event and some other currency (based on PoS) passes BTC's market cap, I don't think it'll be able to recover. The price will go down, miners will abandon their operations, and the BTC network will continue on as a hobby project but will have no significant economic footprint.

"> The thing is micro-payments almost don't exist on the network because of the congestion, so LN solves a non-existing problem. In other words LN introduces new possibility of micro-payments but doesn't address the current congestion.

That fully depends on the capacity of the channels that are being created, with channels in the 50$-100$ range we can easily support common payments for 5$-20$, which is what most day to day transactions are about. Micropayments is but one application, and we may be able to capture a lot of use-cases that are being pushed out by the current high fees. In the end there will be an equilibrium of use-cases that are better suited for LN and others that are better served by on-chain transactions. This equilibrium is not static and will adjust over time.

No, it's a scalability layer built on top of Bitcoin. It aggregates smaller payments before settling them as a whole on-chain. By doing so it reduces the fees for the small payments, increases privacy (your coffee payment will not be stored for eternity in the blockchain) and adds real-time capabilities (once the payment goes through you don't need to wait for confirmations). Payments are denominated and backed by bitcoin, so if you have bitcoins you can use Lightning, no need to buy yet another coin.;10;2;False;cdecker;dqy539g;Lightning is going to come really soon!

"Energy consumption isn't a problem really, it's just the latest thing Bitcoin opponents complain about. How much energy and lost productivity do you think we see worldwide because of Netflix. Millions of people wasting energy running their TVs, sitting around doing nothing. So let's ban Netflix for the good of society, right?

We have markets to establish prices for energy, and as long as someone is willing to pay the price, it doesn't matter if someone else thinks what they're using the energy for is wasteful. I would argue a global, decentralized, open, immutable payment network provides more utility than a service like Netflix, because Netflix literally wastes energy and time simply for entertainment. I obviously would never argue people shouldn't be allowed to waste their time and energy on Netflix and I expect the same courtesy in return.

"I just understood lightning yesterday and I for one don't think it is a good thing. I think we need a HODL on lightning.

Lightning protocol is complicated. It took me sometime to get my head around it - and I am the smartest guy I know. If something is complicated for me - It is complicated for almost everyone. 

The complication is OK - as long is the user experience is not. 

The complication is still OK - as long as you have nothing to loose.

Lightning is complicated for now and fails on both these metrics. Bitcoin might be old for you guys, but Bitcoin is still in its infancy. It needs to be the grown up version of what it already is. If Bitcoin tries to do lightning - I am afraid it will get stuck in the middle. It will neither be lightning nor will it be what it is now.

We just saw a pump and dump yesterday. More attacks are coming. Winter is here. Bitcoin needs to keep its fort and hodl its stance. This is not the time to conquer new lands. 

EDIT: Sorry I didnt meant to brag. I was just trying to be factual. I must admit I dont completely understand how LN works. I found it incredibly complicated to understand. I could be wrong though - I am frequently. Can anyone explain to me quickly what hte user experience of LN is ? How is it superior to fiat today ?

That's still wrong! You can use (= your wallet will use) routes through other channels, if there is no direct channel to a vendor.

"This is kind of a bad example of the problem that LN is addressing. Your issue is more with the exchange fees, and it sounds like you're using a credit card. If you use a bank transfer, the fee is 1% to buy (this isn't un-similar to a commission you'd pay at, say, Fidelity to buy a stock). If you want to transfer your money to gdax and buy using a limit order, you pay ZERO fees (free commission, even better than a typical stock broker). Then you can use gdax to transfer to your wallet, again, for FREE. 

The real problem that this is addressing is speed to get transaction confirmed (at times can be hours, others much quicker depending on traffic), and fees to move around after you've purchased and you're trying to spend or send to another wallet.

"The primary risk of centralization, isn't people running SPV instead of full nodes, but people using trusted 3rd parties instead of controlling their own keys and money.

Let us say Lightning Network works exactly as advertised. There are still some limitations by design:

* You can *only* receive money when you are online. So if you ever want to receive passive payments, you will need to have a node running 24/7.
* You can temporarily not access some of your money if a peer is unavailable. This will happen occasionally.
* You cannot use LN for large payments, so you will have to occasionally ""top-up"" your channels and wait for them.

These may seem like minor issues, but it means that for average Joe, it will be easier, cheaper and more convenient to trust a 3rd party than to control his own node and keys.

This is in sheer contrast with the SPV scaling model, where it is easier, cheaper and more convenient to use your own wallet that verifies the PoW and your own transactions, than to use a 3rd party.

LN may be cool for microtransactions, but for decentralized scaling it is vastly inferior to the SPV/on-chain model.";59;4;False;tomtomtom7;dqy7dzo;Lightning is going to come really soon!

"To add what you've already been told, blocks will still be just as full as ever, so miners will continue to make just as much money as they do now. What lighting brings to the table is a way of amortizing the high transaction fees across very large numbers of transactions.

This buys bitcoin *real* scalability. However, it still relies on the base layer capacity. At some point in the future, bitcoin will still likely need a base capacity upgrade. That *may* be a hard fork on the main chain, but it may *also* be the creation of a side chain with either larger blocks or lower block time intervals or both.

"Just guessing, correct me if I'm wrong:

Assuming the mining fees increase to compensate for the lack of mined coins, the fees would still only be applied when settling the cumulative transactions of a LN channel on the blockchain.

"I think what is great about LN is that it offers an alternative *in addition to* the existing system.

"No, Lightning network are still bitcoin transactions.  The difference is you only spend money to the miners when you need to establish a new channel or the trust with the person you are trading with breaks down.  In theory any malicious behaviour ends up in a channel being closed, a lucky miner receiving a fee and you and the participant both losing out on mining fees.
This means there is an incentive on both parties playing fairly since neither benefits from malice.

That said it does inspire the miner to act maliciously, but it's like saying to miners now, why don't you just deny all tx's except where the fee is > $100?  They wouldn't do this because someone else will take the <$100 fess and it generally would hurt the network and therefore hurt their btc value.  I.e. the miners are incentivised to make sure the network works smoothly so people use it to create/close channels and they make a tidy sum out of the regular easy mining fees.


LN is very much game theory in action though, whether it's successful or not depends on how easy it is for people to use, how safe it is for people to use and ensuring it scales to vast transactions per second (we're talking millions of tx / second eventually... and yes it's still a long way from this but is getting there).


If we can include signed invoices within LN from the outset I think this would be a massive win for society too.  Right now paying arbitrary bitcoin addresses is too technical.


Generally the future of bitcoin is exciting because LN can only fail if something even better takes it's place.

So far LN looks like the winning recipe, just the on/off ramps need to existing fiat systems need simplifying and perhaps this is something the banks will scoop up... my hunch is they're too lethargic to adapt and some young google V3 will own this space.";13;4;False;5tu;dqyq0oc;Lightning is going to come really soon!

"This is something people fail to accept,  and that is bitcoin (and many, many other alts) do not scale. Once the users come, it will bloat any network.  Just look at the high and mighty Ethereum right now. It took only 1 app to bring it down and there are thousands more coming. If the network becomes to demanding (like increasing block size),  we will need more and more powerful equipment to run nodes. Now if we manage to keep up in technology to handle the block size increases, it doesn't matter because the only people who could afford them will be people with money. Eventually you will upnthe block size so high only a few players control the nodes and boom. There's your 51% attack. Also doesn't sound very decentralized anymore does it?  Not to mention poor countries and villages around the world are able to afford the equipment to node up the area.

Now lightning seems like its no longer bitcoin but doing a transaction on bitcoin is still there. Lightning is more like a tool or extension we can use to make instant and free micropayments. If you want to make a big secure payment,  the network is still there for you but to be able to run thousands of baby transactions is just not possible. Again this might make alts look enticing but don't forget how much stress bitcoin network currently has. Those alts will bloat up as soon as the transactions start flowing in. Even BCH has a few blocks already filling up at 8mb. That 8mb will be the new 1mb and they will increase and increase until they have 1 Peta-sized blocks that have to be processed in under 10 minutes,  every 10 minutes. We will fall behind by that time to handle it and if we don't,  again who will adore to be able to run that node? ";16;4;False;iiJokerzace;dqymxnl;Lightning is going to come really soon!

"Here's the thing that I don't think people mention enough; Lightning Network requires the underlying Bitcoin layer. So if you don't want to use Lightning, you don't have to. No one knows for sure, but I've heard some convincing arguments that Lightning will tend towards centralization. If you want to use Lightning with multi-hops so that you open like one payment channel for 6 months and do all your transactions through that, you need to connect to someone who's willing to have lots of channels open, which will probably be a big bank-like entity. 

However, if the software gets there, opening up a channel directly to the coffee shop you frequent will be pretty easy. You can then avoid the privacy reduction by just having that channel dedicated to your coffee shop transactions. This will be more expensive though, and so you'll have to pay extra for that additional space on the Blockchain. You have to decide if that trade off is worth it. However, not having the choice at all (which is what BCH seems to offer) has to be worse because there is no trade off decision to make at all.

"You might have heard the term ""payment channels"". Think of these as extantions of the bitcoin network now requiring more trust to whoever is hosting these payment channels. In theory anyone can host a channel and transactions done on them could be almost free or completely free. Either way the people hosting these payment networks will eventually have to propagate where all the bitcoin sit now to the bitcoin network. They are the ones that will pay a fee to the miners every time they do this and they will be lower since there will be less transactions to bloat the network. 

 Basically what they are doing is instead of having individual transactions flowing through the network, we are going to package thousands, if not, millions into one single transaction to the bitcoin network to drastically reducuce fees and speed.

"> Looking at BCH in terms of USD misses that there is a third place that you could have put your money: Bitcoin.

This goes back to my previous point. If you think Amazon stock is performing well you're forgetting that you could have bought bitcoin instead, which apparently means Amazon is a ""dumpster fire"".
