"So, basically, here's my deconstruction of your exchange:

There price definitely *could* do anything- as there is always a probability of a scenario where it might happen. So you are technically correct and were reminding people it DEFINITELY is a possibility. But it should also be pointed out that he did not specifically state that the price was NEVER going to hit 3k (which would exclude that possibility entirely).

Also- In common vernacular we already take into account that there is always a *possibility* for anything. Therefore, he could only infer from your use of the term *definitely* to imply *strength* in the probability, and structured his argument around that.

So to be fair I believe this is an issue of you projecting a prior argument with others who said the price could NEVER reach 3000 and are actually the one who miscomprehended his statement, despite you being technically correct in your statement. Make sense?

"> But that isn't what's happening. What's happening is, a big rush of small-time investors are treating it like a one-trick pony, and are handicapping both the broader utility and broader adoption in the process.

I think that's the narrative non-believers like to tell themselves, ""it's all dumb money, greedy and gullible fucks buying something they have no idea what is to try to 10x their USD"". I just don't think it's the truth.

Sure, a substantial portion of buyers, when it gets really frothy (as in late 2013 and late 2017) are absolutely these types of people, but I think a lot of them aren’t and for each hype cycle, more people “get it” and become holders longer term and start engaging in learning and building the ecosystem rather than looking at charts.

>Frankly, Bitcoin posts these days are nearly as uninformed and toxic as essential oil or anti-vaxx posts...and they're often being promulgated by the same people.

There is always going to be a lot of price hype, people will celebrate it going up or try to get others to buy in. This is unavoidable. I tend to think the unscientific idiots gravitate to altcoins mostly. Especially the new ones claiming to be Bitcoin 3.0 etc.

>This sub hasn't sunk to those levels, but it's also not exactly a wellspring of balanced thought and enlighted commentary either.

I agree, there are a lot of memes and shitposting here, but I don't think that's systemic to Bitcoin, there is plenty of technical discussion going on if you seek it out (there's a world outside of r/bitcoin). If you are only judging the Bitcoin community from a single subreddit, you won't get a good picture. I personally prefer twitter because I can follow people that have proven to be rational and intelligent (whether I agree with them or not) and if discussion degenerates too much into dumb shit it's easy to curate.

>All your links shows is how the 'fuck you, Imma get mine' attitude has taken over Bitcoin...as an investment. People want to get rich, not establish a new revolutionary means of paying for things.

That's a false dilemma, wanting to increase your own purchasing power is perfectly compatible with wanting to see a monetary revolution. The genius of Bitcoin is that either will do.

>And until they do the second, they're just going to continue to get fleeced by people with the money to manipulate values at will.

Noobs who try to trade this stuff surely will get fleeced. Hopefully they learn from that and stop trying to trade and just hold whatever they can afford to lose. Thankfully, I think most people learn from their mistakes.

>Because while all crypto is still subject to the same market forces that any other currency is subject to, it has none of the regulatory protections that traditional markets have. 

That's the whole idea, Bitcoin is probably the closest thing you can get to an actual free market doing its thing.

>It's a pure recreation of 19th century markets, routine bubbles and all.

Okay. If people worry that we're in a bubble they are probably over levered or buying for the wrong reasons (short term USD speculation).

There's a lot of ""think of the children"" going on with some of these arguments, as if Bitcoin will burglarize people and it's a travesty that they aren't protected. At the end of the day buying Bitcoin is voluntary, I'm a fan of personal responsibility, learning from mistakes and helping spread sound investment advice (with Bitcoin TL;DR: buy only for what you can afford to lose and prepare yourself for volatility).

I do agree that there has been and still is a lot of *really* dumb overly speculative money in this space and it has been healthy with a reality check in the form of a large correction.";1;0;False;YoungScholar89;dxexppi;Bitcoin Doesn't Give a Fuck.;8c6o3w;https://gfycat.com/LinedTallBobcat

"Ok, I'll bite. 

First off, why would anyone ever want to be paid in Bitcoin? Even if volatility disappears entirely (essentially impossible due to the inherent properties of crypto), goods and services are priced in dollars and always will be. But even if your incredibly implausible scenario were to occur, the answer to your question is *absolutely* - the vast majority of people will keep their savings in a bank. Most people have zero interest in ""being their own bank."" Its complicated, risky and serves zero benefit to anyone who doesn't buy into the insane conspiratorial worldview peddled by the likes of ZH and this subreddit. 

Moreover, even if the depository function of banks somehow disappears, it still would not displace their role as underwriters, loan originators (which does *not* depend on deposits, by the way), investment managers, analysts, etc etc.  They do a lot more than just take deposits and Bitcoin can't do any of that.

"If I want to get paid cash electronically. I have to go through a third party, (bank or some other money processing service). Bitcoin will eliminate this. In seconds I could have my funds 100% secured into my personal wallet and in seconds spend it. 

Why would someone *want* to get paid in BTC? Well if the value is slightly going up, say 2% year, sure I'll take it. If it gives me 100% control sure I'll take it. If it's as easy as, click I made a wallet, now please deposit my money, sure I'll take it - no need to setup a bank account. I can spend it in seconds, convert to other crypto, pay bills more efficiently, just wave my phone over a vending machine with a QR code and buy snacks. Bitcoin will make transacting much easier and efficient. We are living in a digital world, money is inevitably going digital - and decentralized money spent across boarders will be in more demand. 

As of now lots of ideas are being put forth to design systems that make everything simple, safe, efficient. It's not going to happen overnight, and that's why right now its best to invest cause its dirt cheap. If bitcoin hits a very high price, volatility will greatly reduce. If it were to break $1mil a coin I doubt we would see 10% swings a day, more like 0.1% a day, but at that high of a value it would more likely slowly rise than ever drop massively.

"You have a narrow view of what money is. Obviously, nobody HODLs $5 bills expecting increased purchasing power, however this isn't necessarily true with non-fiat moneys.

[Here's an infographic](http://money.visualcapitalist.com/infographic-the-properties-of-money/) that explains the 3 main properties of money.

* Store of Value (SoV)
* Medium of Exchange (MoE)
* Unit of Account (UoA)

The computer science breakthrough of Bitcoin is trustless digital scarcity, this allows Bitcoin to have properties similar to gold with a finite supply (but with a much more well-defined emission curve and cap). Realistically, most people here don't have a lot of issues using their national currency as MoE and obviously as UoA. However, all fiat money (some by orders of magnitude more) are terrible long term SoV's, by design. This is where Bitcoin is unique and why many prefer the analogy of ""digital gold"" to something like ""stateless dollar"".

People keep having these misguided views that Bitcoin has failed because we don't see broad use in commerce, this mostly because of the term ""crypto currency"". They fail to see that while more use in commerce would be cool, it's not the killer app at all and not the natural first step for an organically appearing new money.";0;1;False;YoungScholar89;dxdmlv2;Bitcoin Doesn't Give a Fuck.;8c6o3w;https://gfycat.com/LinedTallBobcat
You can't apply the properties of fiat money (Dollars, Euros Yen) to Bitcoin. The dollar money supply has increased a huge amount especially recently and is guaranteed to go down in value, but Bitcoin supply is increasing at a much lower rate and it is a new currency seeing huge new investment so naturally the price has been rising. It's possible that Bitcoin will be seen mainly as a digital gold, with very little use as a currency. But I think at some market cap value, say $2 trillion,  large companies will be compelled to start accepting Bitcoin as there would be too much value in Bitcoin not to tap into it.;1;1;False;Bits4Tits;dxe0kjo;Bitcoin Doesn't Give a Fuck.;8c6o3w;https://gfycat.com/LinedTallBobcat

"A new money will never become SoV, MoE and UoA from day one, it's a lengthy process and Bitcoin has already come far from being a fringe ""fun collectible"" for nerds to being considered judgement and censorship resistant store of value and inflation hedge by a lot of people. 

Digital gold I think is the best analogy of what it is slowly becoming - it's obviously the early days and price volatility is unavoidable. Nothing grows like Bitcoin has grown in a linear fashion, it's simply impossible with human psychology.

People generally think way too much in USD price terms and miss the exciting part: Bitcoins emission curve. 

This is the first ever experiment in practically unstoppable and verifiable, extreme digital scarcity. It's unlike anything we've seen before it, so it is hard to make sense of intuitively. I think if people forgot about the price in USD completely, backed up and tried not to bring their preconceived ideas of money with them, detractors that are honest with themselves would find themselves a lot less cocksure in declaring it an inevitable failure.

This is what I think, I know there are no guarantees in investing or in life in general. I'm not going to try to convince you that Bitcoin can be sound money, it's fine that you disagree. I don't think Bitcoin will become less polarizing anytime soon, but it doesn't really need to be that to succeed. It just need an inflow of people with without deeply entrenched ideas, ask some fundamental questions about money and come to a similar conclusion that many have already, that this is a huge improvement over fiat moneys. The vehement detractors chomping at the bit to call it a failure and declare it dead, has if anything, been very helpful in spreading it due to the Streisand effect.

I'll leave you with an article from early 2014 that counters the ""you need to spend your Bitcoins to help grow the ecosystem, ""hodling""/hoarding it is bad"", it's a fun read, fairly concise and it should at the very least help you understand the logic of ""hodlers of last resort"" and how SoV predates MoE.

"I have a very specific view of what money is: all three of those things. Bitcoin isn't used as two of those - it's a store of value only. Hence my comment. It's being used as an investment vehicle, and an inherently risky and unregulated one at that. 

Trying to resell it as 'digital gold' only proves my point. We don't use gold as money. We use it as a relatively stable hedge against investment market volatilities. But Bitcoin and other crypto aren't remotely stable enough to serve as a hedge, so they instead act as a primary investment. And a very stupid and risky one. 

There's safety and profit in mining, but that's it. Right now, Bitcoin is primarily a tool for parting gullible small time investors who think they know what they're doing from their money, via a sort of gambler's fallacy writ large.";2;1;False;whistleridge;dxe10ej;Bitcoin Doesn't Give a Fuck.;8c6o3w;https://gfycat.com/LinedTallBobcat
"> You can't apply the properties of fiat money (Dollars, Euros Yen) to Bitcoin.

As it's currently used, no. But that's where its real conceptual value is. Using it as a 'new gold' offers all of the risks of an unregulated stock market, and none of the security of actual gold. It's wildly unstable in value, the only consist benefit comes from mining, and ultimately it returns far more risk than benefit.

"But he said that in response to the comment above which said ""it's at 7800 *now*"". So the statement is true that it's ""not at the 3k many said it would be"" since it's referring to the present moment. He didn't say that it would never reach that price- only that it's not currently at that price now. 

Let's say a weight lifter is supposed to hit a 500 pound bench press by next year. He gets into an accident and people are doubtful he will ever lift weights again.

Satoshi and everyone else involved in Bitcoin in the early days had to fairly mine or buy the bitcoin themselves. There was a real opportunity cost and they bore real risk to obtain those bitcoins.
