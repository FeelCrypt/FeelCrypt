"I meet some people who don't even like metal but still frequent metal festivals because of fun occasionally. I also met one guy in a bus station waiting for the bus heading to one metal fest a month ago. He was very tidy dressed and appeared a bit nervous because it was the first such festival for him and he didn't know what it was all about. This weekend I met him again in another festival. He was wearing a leather jacket, all drunk, torn apart and dirty, running in circles while waving his penis around. Quite a rapid change in such a short time.

These two are for this year's fest, you can find older ones. However most of them are in Lithuanian, so I doubt you'll understand much haha. But you could take a look into the English version of their also broken [website](http://daubafest.eu/indexen.htm). Kinda funny too, as the whole fest was.;2;0;False;BeerPowered;cjufncd;This guy scammed a scammer! (x-post /r/justiceporn);2dlord;http://imgur.com/a/tR48B

"Hahaha! That video is awesome. I'm not big into metal, but judging from their personalities I think that any type of person could have fun there. Especially ""make divings"" into the ""river near our festivals.""";1;1;False;booksforlunch;cju03zw;This guy scammed a scammer! (x-post /r/justiceporn);2dlord;http://imgur.com/a/tR48B
