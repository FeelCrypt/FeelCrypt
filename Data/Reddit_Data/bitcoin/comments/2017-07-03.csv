Oh I definitely agree in the short run, but in time people and entrepreneurs find solution work arounds that allow individuals freedom of choice. Bitcoin is so important because once capital is completely mobile and can't be contained, the world will have to be governed completely different. The State Powers that try to stifle its usage will be left behind as other States embrace it as an opportunity for capital investment and local innovation. It's essentially what was laid out in the Sovereign Individual in that, in time power will continue to be more decentralized and move to the individual. It is Evolutionary. The internet has allowed information to flow more efficiently and essentially at zero cost to the consumer. Not only is crypto currency in the early stages, in reality the internet is still in its infancy and it is continually evolving as well. It's only been 29 years since it was introduced. ;8;1;False;purduered;djq6wn4;South Korea is Preparing to Regulate and Legalize Bitcoin;6kzmhp;https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/south-korea-preparing-legalize-bitcoin/
It means that a lot of investors and entrepreneurs will be extremely pissed and innovation will move elsewhere in the world. Make no mistake, the NY Bitcoin license set a precedence to the rest of the States of what not to do. Majority of crypto innovation left and went elsewhere. If the US federal government did the same, the same reaction would happen except on a national level. Essentially for disbandment to work, majority of every nation state needs to collude in disbanding it. However it's basically the prisoners dilemma in that the country that defects from the collusion benefits as innovation and opportunity in the space would flee to that geolocation. and they'd have more of a first mover advantage. This essentially leads to everyone defecting from enforcement. Japan's move is essentially the first domino that will lead to every nation eventually embracing Bitcoin. If the state does not embrace it and tries to stifle it, they will essentially miss out in the long run. This is essentially what happened with China trying to control their internet for so long and has caused them to play catch up in the dot com space. It's the reason why they will not make Bitcoin illegal there either because in large part their people would benefit greatly from the long term success of it as they are huge first movers in the space.;8;0;False;purduered;djqaeoc;South Korea is Preparing to Regulate and Legalize Bitcoin;6kzmhp;https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/south-korea-preparing-legalize-bitcoin/

"> I believe bitcoin will be much like pot regulation and filesharing regulation - the regulations are there but millions of people ignore them and get away with it.

If government tries to regulate Bitcoin its self then of course it'd be like file sharing, it's decentralized so it cares not for government. But I think most governments are starting to figure out that any attempt to ban Bitcoin or regulate the network its self is in effective and few of them want to do so. At least not in free democratic countries. 

Thing is while regulating user is much like regulating pot and torrents (it just doesn't work), regulating exchanges and MSBs on the other hand are more like governments regulating banks, that tends to work (unless the banks get the upper hand and start regulating the government...)";1;0;False;PoliticalDissidents;djqnldl;South Korea is Preparing to Regulate and Legalize Bitcoin;6kzmhp;https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/south-korea-preparing-legalize-bitcoin/

"**Economic system**

An economic system is a system of production, resource allocation, and distribution of goods and services within a society or a given geographic area. It includes the combination of the various institutions, agencies, entities, decision-making processes, and patterns of consumption that comprise the economic structure of a given community. As such, an economic system is a type of social system. The mode of production is a related concept.

"I did read your post. My main point is that many regulations are designed for enforcement after the fact. If at some point in the future you get audited, or the government comes to learn about the transaction they've got an extra charge to slap onto a person. They may never find out, but if they do they've got something extra to use against you. 

For example a state passed a law requiring drug dealers to pay tax on the sales of illicit drugs. I think the tax stamps could be bought at the gov't office. So now when they catch a drug dealer they don't just charge them w the regular narco laws, they get to slap on some tax evasion. 

So you're right, so long as your use of crypto leaves behind no evidence you'll be fine. At the time of the transaction the government has no idea crypto was used. But if you get audited/investigated and your personal financial life doesn't seem to balance, you'll have some legal trouble.

"Cash is regulated.  Just because something cannot be perfectly enforced, it doesn't mean it will exist completely outside of the regulatory sphere.

Take a restaurant that wants to accept bitcoin.  They're going to want to make that visible (or, what's the point?).  That'll be kind of hard to hide if there is any kind of investigation into them.  So if there is some kind of regulation regarding bitcoin, it would likely make sense for them to go along with it (assuming it's not cripplingly onerous, of course).";6;0;False;makriath;djqgckv;South Korea is Preparing to Regulate and Legalize Bitcoin;6kzmhp;https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/south-korea-preparing-legalize-bitcoin/

"> Well yeah you can freely murder people too if you don't get caught

This is a majorly apples to oranges comparison. You have an 80% or so chance of getting caught if you commit murder. By contrast, laws regulating the use of bitcoin are much, much more difficult to enforce.

> The coin kids' idea that they are above the law shows just how naive to the world they are.
