"Guys I've made a mistake. I wanted to transfer some BTC from my Ledger Nano S to my Bittrex acc. Usually not the most difficult job. However, somehow I didn't press both buttons on my Nano Ledger to confirm the transaction (I only pressed the left button, so to reject, when I was grabbing my Nano Ledger..) Now my balance is 0 en my transaction is gone, however unconfirmed and I can do nothing to cancel this transaction. I also don't see anything pending on my Bittrex account. Does anyone know how long this will take before the money will be send back to me? I see the following here: https://ledger.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005497169-Sending-failed-An-error-occurred

"LOL

Man things were different back then, it seems quaint now. I remember worrying back in 2013 that my 7970's would overheat and cause my whole room to catch on fire. Having to cut out holes in my case and put in Noctua fans on the outside to get more air in. I had a really high end card prior to that and it fried from overheating, it made me paranoid about temps. GPUs today are much cooler and more efficient. Maybe not Vega but Pascal runs cool and also there are really good coolers today from all the manufacturers. Back then my stock clocked 7970 cards ran at 85C if I left them running for more than a few hours, and forget overclocking.  I had to buy an Accelero Xtreme ($300 for 2 back then) to put on them, and I was nervous as hell taking the cooler off and putting on the new one.

The scarcity concept of Bitcoin is easily surmountable. now can you tell me why I’m wrong?

"Scarcity is the main promoter of value in the world. Couple that with security, liquidity, practicality and programmability and its a self sustainable circle. 

As long as is it scarce, it will grow in price, as long as it grows in price, it will be attractive for miners, as long as miners are in, the security of the transactions and the blockchain rises, which attracts more value from less secure instruments (cash, deposits, derivatives, real estate (depending on location)), which rises the demand, and the cycle repeats (and I´m not talking about traders, but you can put them into the equation and it will just accelerate the thing).

Of course it will not hold all the capital in the world, but even taking in count the other cryptos, the available supply from the physical world is really big (and growing every day thanks to the fractional reserve system and the ongoing devaluation of the old ""paper"" currencies), and ""real"" instruments are very scarce (physical gold and other precious metal and elements, art, etc and lack the liquidity/practicality that bitcoin and other cryptos have).";2;1;False;eXWoLL;ds4wdua;9 years ago block 0 was mined.

Bitcoin will soon be superseded by technically superior coins with better privacy, lower fees, more stable values, faster transactions. When that happens, what is the force that is stopping Bitcoin falling in price and the superior coin taking its place? As far as I can see, it’s the centralised institutions that want to keep the price high. Exchanges, mining pools, early investors, holders, drug market operators. 

I understand the utility of crypto, I just don’t see how anyone can be so confident bitcoin will stay number 1.

"If the code itself forks from bitcoin, it would become The bitcoin, there is no point there to address, since everyone would have the same amount of them as the old chain. 

Now in case that it's some new coin, it should be really really really very good and in some way beat the shit out of BTC and deem it obsolete in all ways in order for people to leave an established, and gradually shrinking in supply asset, for some new coin with a short blockchain, lower value and uncertain future. We already have coins that beat BTC in a lot of ways, but there are still no queues of people wanting to sell their BTC to jump into them!

Would be the same case as gold (with so many other options that outperform it in every single way) or some ""solid"" equities being out there for ages even when a lot of new and better companies pop out every other year.

I never wrote that BTC will remain #1, doubt it will keep that place for the next year or two, but Berckshire isnt the #1 company either (or, 2 o r 5) and it costs almost 300kUSD/share.

Those 1000 people will have that BTC as precious stones and use them to settle trades efficiently with very big quantities for the years to come, unless something really big happens that would kill the coin and make it obsolete in one of its main attributes.

"**Paradox of value**

The paradox of value (also known as the diamond–water paradox) is the apparent contradiction that, although water is on the whole more useful, in terms of survival, than diamonds, diamonds command a higher price in the market. The philosopher Adam Smith is often considered to be the classic presenter of this paradox, although it had already appeared as early as Plato's Euthydemus. Nicolaus Copernicus, John Locke, John Law and others had previously tried to explain the disparity.

"I'm guessing 473,354 was calculated [assuming 1 year = 365.2425 days on average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar).

To be more precise:

9 years * 365 days = 4,730,400 minutes

2012 and 2016 were leap years, which adds 2 days = 2,880 minutes

Thus, in total there should have been about 473,328 blocks in the last 9 years.

The block mined closest to 9 years after the timestamp of the genesis block (2009-01-03 18:15:05) was 502,400 (2018-01-03 18:14:02).

"Winston is **nowhere close** to the racism shown in that 2016 film. He is a voice of reason for the team, and even if you think he's the weakest character in the original (he's not) his monologue:

 ""I'm Winston Zeddmore, Your Honor. I've only been with the company for a couple of weeks, but these things are real. Since I joined these men, I've seen shit that'll turn you white.""

....is written better than **any** single sentence in the script of the reboot.

I am not talking about ""Hollywood"" over-sexualizing. Attractiveness is a general trait of most actors/actresses in hollywood as they grab attention. The problem is when that sexualization applies to the characters themselves. It's less about him being attractive to the audience and more about him being the sexual attraction to the female characters in the film.

The original wasn't a children's movie. My own parents enjoyed it as well as many others I know far older than myself. This was a timeless family classic that spans generations and holds up well to this day.

This film was so far off the original I feel uncomfortable even comparing them even with a simile.

As much as I dislike Big Bang Theory even those creators show nerds more respect than this absolute shit show.

Quite frankly, I believe to like or defend this film you'd have to be: sexist, racist, **and** have a uniquely horrible sense of humor; and an extreme dislike for anything about the first one. ";5;1;False;;ds3z9bc;Bitcoin today;7no7ty;https://i.imgur.com/ykjMMov.jpg

I 100% percent agree with you about the black stereotype but I would direct you to the first Ghostbusters at Winston's own character and will say maybe not as stereotypical as the reboot, but a very poorly thought out character, with his occasional one liners and short words of wisdom. Unfortunately Hollywood as a whole is over sexualizing everybody so that's just something you're going to have to get used to. I mean, while Dana was a stronger female character than Chris she definitely was sexualized for the movie. Their main mistake, on top of those, was they made a children's movie. They wanted to sell toys cause that is where they made their money last time. The original series was a comedic SciFi adventure while the reboot felt more like a slapstick comedy fest with some over the top CGI to make it science fiction. They took the route of Big Bang Theory nerddom and made a full length movie out of it. ;0;1;False;Linrono;ds3y505;Bitcoin today;7no7ty;https://i.imgur.com/ykjMMov.jpg

Would it be possible for Bitcoin to drop back down to -1000 levels due to regulation and rise again?

I only ask because I would like to buy BTC but it just feels like I missed the ship. And I want to catch the next wave... I'm just hoping there's another wave.

"You also don't see the thousands of other ideas that would or could have replaced those technologies materialize the way shitcoins do though.

With altcoins the opposite is reality. Any goober with a coding team and $10,000 can come out with one and dozens of new coins come out every day.  

 Bitcoin is more like a format. It's 35mm film. It's the universal standard. While modern digital technology aims to replace it in as many ways and places as possible it's still the most important piece of the puzzle and necessary at the base level.

"Personally I do my personal banking with First Direct, they are by far and a way the best bank.

But for crypto and other things, I have Halifax, Lloyd's, Barclays, Santander, RBS, Natwest & co-op.

All free basic accounts opened in a few minutes online. There's absolutely no reason to bank only with one, and actually it was useful recently, a scammer on Localbitcoins nearly stole £800 from me. Luckily they did not, thanks entirely to Lloyd's.

But for a few days while it was being sorted out my Lloyd's account where the funds went was frozen.

So it was lucky that my direct debts all come from RBS, my personal spending cash is in First Direct, and savings are in Co-op. Which meant I didn't fail any payments and still had access to funds.

Just to be clear, if you recieve stolen funds into one account let's say Lloyd's, and transfer it out into another lets say Santander, Lloyd's will freeze both their accounts and the Santander accounts. So you should leave the funds in Lloyd's if using local bitcoins for a week before transferring out to make sure it's legitimate. Or withdraw in cash.

Personally, I am done with local bitcoins now and sticking to exchanges. There is too much risk.

This person had a lot of feedback, all ID, selfie etc. But I figured out something was wrong and had to drive 3 hours each way to the house on the ID to warn the person who owned the account.

The only reason I lost out was because they deemed it that she had been grossly negligent by giving out her account login details along with her identification documents.

That is a difference to ""generally accepted"". Arguments on Bitcoin always on a global scale, Bitcoin is not US-centric.

There are countless examples in history. Well, you never experienced that in the US.

You claimed that ""its only circulated on a few crypto exchanges, dark markets, and even less retailers."" which is a kind of distorted view and not supported by evidence. In contrast most of the Bitcoins are stored on addresses of private users.

In a market economy everything changes its value on a daily basis. Besides that the Dollar lost most of its purchasing power since 1913.

Bitcoin does not circulate on crypto exchanges, this is simply wrong. It is a p2p-currency which circulates between people, retailers, institutions and governments. 
US Dollar has been the preferred currency in dark markets for decades. The illegal drug market in the US alone is more than  $100 billion/year.

Wrong. 

> its not held in a bank.

This is changing. Swiss banks offer Bitcoin accounts. Exchanges like Coinbase is essentially a bank, since it is almost regulated like a bank and holds fiat and cryptos for you. 

> its value fluctuates and is not stored as a currency would be. it does not tie to the dollar in any relevant way.

It's a pure market currency. Pegs are anti-market and most pegs have failed in history. Most currencies are floating. Not an argument.

Two third of all government issued currencies did not held its value. They simply disappeared. You are just reducing your definition on the US-Dollar, which is kind of short sighted.

> Bitcoin does not circulate on crypto exchanges, this is simply wrong. It is a p2p-currency which circulates between people, retailers, institutions and governments. US Dollar has been the preferred currency in dark markets for decades. The illegal drug market in the US alone is more than $100 billion/year.

so when you go on nicehash and buy crypto. is that not circulating on the crypto exchange?  im not impressed by its ability to be used on the dark web. i am saying if anything that is a negative, that its main/primary use is for illegal activity.

> it has no coins or paper money.

ok? so show me some of the coins or paper money....

> its not held in a bank.
> 
> This is changing. Swiss banks offer Bitcoin accounts. Exchanges like Coinbase is essentially a bank, since it is almost regulated like a bank and holds fiat and cryptos for you.

essentially is not the same. dont get me wrong. banks may own a shitton of this. i bet they do (and are the ones pumping it), but they do not hold it as a measure of securing liabilities to its customers. it is not held to vouch for a customers account. is this swiss bank just letting you stash your coins in a wallet? or are they actively giving you interest on it, using it when you arent, and circulating it like they would with cash? im sure btc can get there but its not happening now.

> its value fluctuates and is not stored as a currency would be. it does not tie to the dollar in any relevant way.
> 
> It's a pure market currency. Pegs are anti-market and most pegs have failed in history. Most currencies are floating. Not an argument.

dude thats a load of crap. i dont mean it is 'pegged' to the dollar. i mean relevant. something that was $500 last year and was almost $20000 this year has NO RELEVANCE TO TO THE DOLLAR.  its range is far to wide to have any meaning.  it has nothing to do with floating or pegged. you are just bringing up random stuff. it has everything to do with storing a value and being secure. it clearly does not do that, as the range indicates.

> if anything its like a point system that any brand would have. for example a credit card point system, or coins at chuck e cheese.
> 
> ????
> 

not sure whats confusing. would you rather have 100k credit card points with chase or lehman brothers? would you rather have 100k points with BTC or dogecoin?

> not saying i have anything against btc. just dont see it as a currency. the most key part of a currency is its ability to hold its value in regards to a market, and btc does not do that at all. it could be $100k by the end of the year or $100.
> 
> Two third of all government issued currencies did not held its value. They simply disappeared. You are just reducing your definition on the US-Dollar, which is kind of short sighted.

"BTC is a currency, a cryptocurrency.

Most of the Universities define it as such; Cambridge, Cornell, MIT and Princeton to name a few. The whitepaper that founded cryptocurrency also says it is a currency, electronic cash.

It is used as a currency and on most of the general internet, it too is referenced as such.
