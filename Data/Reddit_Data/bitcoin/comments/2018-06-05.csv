"I gave a fellow hunter this list, they ran it to get various combos in BIP39 and BIP49 -- none seem to generate the address to the prize. So to save everyone time these were the words that failed as a combination (in no particular order):

* network
* process
* since
* know
* model
* able
* problem
* next
* power
* size
* place
* add

Correct me if I am wrong but an address starting with 3 is not always a m/49/...derivation path (multisig). Per https://bitcoincore.org/en/segwit_wallet_dev/ it is indicated « Until a P2SH-P2WPKH UTXO is spent and the redeemScript is exposed, a P2SH-P2WPKH address is indistinguishable from a non-segwit P2SH address (such as a non-segwit multi-signature address) ». Maybe that was the reason that the btc was moved to a new address, to spend it and be able to look at the redeemscript. Anybody familiar with redeemscripts could look at it?;1;2;False;CryptoSatus;e04xipw;1 BTC is hidden in this puzzle. Good luck!;8kk0pa;https://i.redd.it/g4rbvtbiwry01.png
