Of course they know it's there . To buy or cash out any Bitcoin you need to give them all your details.. Passport, bank account,home address ..  They know exactly how much you have and where you live .. Bitcoin is a government run project ..all this talk of becoming free of the system is just a carrot in front of our faces we are walking straight into a system  ( blockchain ) that will enslave us 10 times more then we are now .. They want a cashless society and always have done .. I can't believe people actually think satoshi is some rogue genius that just happened to invent the most paradigm shifting tech since the Internet ..

How did you set up your account on bittrex ?? Passport ? Address ? Bank account ? You think your movements within bittrex are invisible ? How do you plan to cash out ? Every time you buy or cash out its logged even if you send your btc to a different account it's still come from your original account that they have all your details for .. Lol .. They will wait until enough people are involved then all of a sudden you will have to declare how much crypto you have anyone that's ever made an account on any crypto exchange will be first to be sent a letter to the address that you used to open your account asking to declare your amount .. I can't actually believe people think this is running outside of the govenment .. Bitcoin is everywhere mainstream media is covering it all the time .. If it was a rogue project there would be a media blackout .. The fact celebrities are pushing it should have rung a few bells .. You are extremely naive to think you are some kind of outlier ..

"I feel like you must be relatively new to crypto. 

Back in 2013 and before, almost nobody was into crypto for the riches. It was almost exclusively people who distrusted centralized banks and who were interested in technology. 

It’s hard to imagine now, but in those days the big trend was to spend crypto wherever possible, and to give it away to your friends to encourage them to use it. 

Back then there was no talk of Lambos. I don’t remember anyone speaking about crypto as a way to get rich. Talk primarily centered around making crypto (BTC) a viable alternative to fiat currency. One that was free of political manipulation and fear of inflation. 

To be clear, I wasn’t one of those people. I’m not here to get rich, either.  (I don’t hold any crypto and never have.) I’m just pointing out that the get-rich-quick aspect of crypto is a relatively new phenomenon, and the tech/politically-minded enthusiasts were, up until about 18 months ago, the rule rather than the exception.

"Exactly. I mean yeah, I love the technology and concept and as someone living overseas it would be fan-fucking-tastic if crypto was widely accepted and I could just easily buy shit in person or online with something like NANO, but I've mostly been investing because I expect the value to go up, period. 

Ideally I'll be able to use my coins directly in the not so far future, but ultimately the goal is to increase finances regardless of what form they take. 

I refuse to believe anyone that isn't in this for financial reasons unless they're already multi-millionaires, and even then only if they only have a token amount of coins.";3;0;False;Tyr808;dywmm68;This is Cryptocurrency;8j01gs;https://i.redd.it/t85dnponkix01.jpg
