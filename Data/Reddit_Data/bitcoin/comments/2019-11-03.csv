That's horrific. How can Bitcoin be flatlined and people openly support it? Madness!;73;2;False;HydraGene;f6cjmm3;Finally some good use.;dqzisc;https://i.redd.it/leixvkuvogw31.jpg
I put half of my net worth in bitcoin and if it stays even or at least matched inflation I’m happy. Rather than keep it in a savings account who give me .01% for my money.;5;2;False;holddadoorhodor;f6d6rrv;Finally some good use.;dqzisc;https://i.redd.it/leixvkuvogw31.jpg
Yes, for a few days. After that? Can it be volatile again or does it still need to stay flat? There has to be some kind of volatility. Green percentages get the attention we need, with that comes red percentages. Nobody is going to put money into something that does basically nothing.;2;2;False;HydraGene;f6d07vo;Finally some good use.;dqzisc;https://i.redd.it/leixvkuvogw31.jpg
I would say bitcoin tracks USD more on a debt ratio. USD is decreasing as the result of debt, and trust. That’s why we have inflation. This isn’t feasible with bitcoin. Flatlines are okay for a few days no need to start selling off your positions.;4;1;False;pricklypencil;f6cuymc;Finally some good use.;dqzisc;https://i.redd.it/leixvkuvogw31.jpg
What I'm saying is that you don't need volatility to decentralize value. Just volume.;7;0;False;l0rb;f6ec5c7;Finally some good use.;dqzisc;https://i.redd.it/leixvkuvogw31.jpg
Bruh, since 2015.. But another surge is bad according to you? A flat line means decrease in value. If Bitcoin would stay at a flat line, then Bitcoin would decrease in value, because FIAT decreases in value due to inflation.;6;1;False;HydraGene;f6cugja;Finally some good use.;dqzisc;https://i.redd.it/leixvkuvogw31.jpg

Volatility is not good with an intended currency. It’s just the early stages and short term it will always results in a settlement into a little flatline before another surge or dip. Seriously have you purchased BTC before?;7;1;False;pricklypencil;f6cr3mh;Finally some good use.;dqzisc;https://i.redd.it/leixvkuvogw31.jpg

"But what about the gains!? 

On a serious note, volatility is good. It displaces value, as it is supposed to do. Value shouldn't be hoarded and be concentrated at one place. Value has to flow, otherwise there is no economy.";7;3;False;HydraGene;f6cndgm;Finally some good use.;dqzisc;https://i.redd.it/leixvkuvogw31.jpg
