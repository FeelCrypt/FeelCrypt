"If you think of the world like a video game bitcoin is the only thing where there will never be more of than the market cap so in theory making it the most valuable thing in existent.
For an example in Runescape you have had an event which released useless party hats in the game these gave you no help or extra bonuses.
But after that event they were never more released while their were a lot of new coins created.
So after a while people catch on to the idea that it was the only way of truly holding it's value in the game and prices have skyrocketed every since.
The real value has gone from 5 in 2013 to 6000 even out preforming bitcoin itself.
But in Runescape you could not invest like in the real world and compound your wealth. ";1;0;False;oigid;eeb6aq7;Whenever you doubt yourself, remember this guy.;ackua3;https://i.redd.it/hs9p8g3b6g821.jpg
