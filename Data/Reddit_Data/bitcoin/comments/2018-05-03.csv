Credit unions tend be much smaller and limited to a particular area, at least they do in my country. Therefore you have many smaller points of aggregation, and even the catastrophic loss of one credit union wouldn't have much, if any, impact on others, whereas we allow mainstream banks to become too big to fail, even internationally. Centralisation isn't a binary metric. It's tiresome how many people ignorantly suggest it is, especially on this subreddit, where people ought to know better.;0;1;False;pepe_le_shoe;dyde8il;What a time to be alive!;8g8vqu;https://i.redd.it/rbt35cjw89v01.jpg

What about a credit union isn’t centralized? The members deposit their money into a CENTRAL location that is the credit union. The credit union then loans that money out from the CENTRAL location to make money. Again, the only real difference between a bank and a credit union is a bank makes money by charging more for loans than it gives back to the people it’s borrowing from, while a credit union gives back more to cancel out those profits. It is no less centralized.

"No, I don't but I've been in crypto for six years.

>So bitcoins price will have hit a million dollars with just one order and for that one instant everybody's bitcoin would have been worth one million dollars

That's why they have average and close of day price etc. Anyway, you could argue the other way. Someone bought ETH for ten cents or something last autumn but that did not mean ETH's market cap was obliterated.

>Market cap doesn't equal total money supply bought in to the coin, market cap is the PAPER value of all the coins.


All things being equal you could say that about any money or asset. Gold has a trillion dollar market cap but using your logic if everyone decides to sell it all...

My original point still stand.

Other than the fact that they are the ones most able to do it and the timeline of when the spam was happening more/less was coinciding with BCH events/announcements (particularly from Ver), it's circumstantial, sure, but ask yourself who would be most motivated to carry out such an attack? They've made it their modus operandi to sell BCH by trashing BTC, instead of on its own virtues, and they control a lot of BTC and hash power.

> Also if you want to disconnect from government fiat you're going to have to get used to insider trading being ok. Ain't nothing besides a government gonna stop that. Ver may be an asshole but he's right about that.

If you take an extreme libertarian view, perhaps. But within the current exchange space, where most of it is regulated, moves like the pre-GDAX BCH trading were clearly wrong in most people's eyes, and preventable.

Honestly man, I didn't realize I was in r/bitcoin, I thought I was replying to a post from cryptomarkets. So firstly, I was kind of surprised that anyone was in favor of Bcash, and I was also interested to know why they are actually in favor of Bcash. I'm open to listening to people, and I wanted to learn more, but yea r/bitcoin is probably not the best platform for that discussion \(though I think there should be open discussion about it, because it's important\). I'm a pretty decidedly anti\-Bcash person, but I also have $0 invested in bitcoin at the moment.

"The pros of BCH are pretty obvious, being able to increase the blocksize at will, as long as miners are okay with low to no fees, means transactions can be practically free.

The idea that this can increase adoption is pretty solid, and if it weren't trying to conflate the names, it would be a pretty solid coin on it's own, maybe even overtake Bitcoin on it's merits and eventually achieve consensus and 'be' Bitcoin.

The fact that they aren't going this route is probably half 'not wanting to give up on their original plan', and half not believing in the coin as a standalone project, or thinking that allowing the existing Bitcoin to go unchallenged splits the market too much, so the benefits of killing Bitcoin and taking it's place are worth the risk of failing and drying up, or even killing both coins.  

Since people can't control the existing Bitcoin, they're better off making an attack than attempting their own route.  Plus, if they could 'take over' Bitcoin, they could promise/threaten/cajole the big miners in the way the BTC currently can, but I expect Roger has more profitable motives for it rather than the purportedly altruistic motive of the core team.";2;1;False;dnick;dyeal9p;WOW, this just happened on Jeopardy! last night.;8gop47;https://i.redd.it/4b4njtb2jlv01.png

"As the other guy said, there's nothing bad with BCH itself, it's the people trying to claim that BCH is 'Bitcoin'.  
BCH had, and still has, its chance to 'be' Bitcoin based on consensus and a longer chain (i don't know how that would work after this long, but conceptually I guess it's the same chain).  

The problem is, Ver insisted and basically gambled that the split, and resulting 'better' code would have such obvious benefits that all processing would shift over to BCH, they would have the longer chain, and BCH would legitimately be Bitcoin.   When that didn't happen, that crew basically tried insisting that BCH is still Bitcoin based on their insistence that the code is better, even though it didn't achieve consensus.  

Since the 'brand' of Bitcoin, it's market visibility and pretty much everything about the name 'Bitcoin' is more popular, and since he somehow controls some popular (centralized) marketing mechanisms for the word 'Bitcoin', it's more profitable for him to push 'Bitcoin' users (especially new ones that don't know any better) to Bitcoin Cash.  

It's basically far more profitable, and a better gamble for him in general, to ignore consensus, use his resources to bolster Bitcoin Cash, and take whatever he can get out of it.  It he decides it's a losing battle, he'll know when to get out before everyone else (just like he literally admitted to doing when getting 'into' it right when/before coinbase started listing it) and he will be no worse off for having 'passionately advocated for what he believed in', just like he 'passionately advocated for BTC' before he got frustrated that he couldn't control it with his passion and business skills/con-ish behavior.
