"But how does the price dropping drastically help with the technology? I agree that a stable price (steadily growing) is what bitcoin needs to succeed. Price continuing to fall hurts the technology. If it’s low enough, miners won’t have the incentive to mine, etc. 

Putting $1,000USD in and it being worth $100USD now does not help technology. So that’s where I fail to understand all these posts about “yay this thing I bought for more usd is worth less now!” What would be good for bitcoin and the technology growth is if its value related to fiat was growing at a steady ~10% per year.

"Some of these shows are really good at teaching you how to manipulate a crowd. It is just amazing people's bias and how they will just lie and lie and lie without knowing it... or rather change the past to fit a narrative, but the footage shows otherwise. Or how the dweebs are usually the most disloyal, and cute girls do anything to create a victim complex.

Far and away the most reliable people are jocks - bar none. But the winners are really good at creating believable stories of 'the other' and then sowing the seeds repeatedly. The best example of this in Survivor was [Sandra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandra_Diaz-Twine): a fat black women. She could never win a comp, but moms are great a manipulating crowds - and she'd do anything to win. She would find the crowd ganging up on the other black person, and then steal the thing the victim had been asking for, claiming the victim must of taken it, playing into the prejudice, while causing the victim to go crazy.

She was dominating the 3rd season she was in too, until she repeatedly and nonchalantly talked about wringing the chicken's neck. It made others become unsettled.

This season of Big Brother was really good... don't checkout the spoilers but here are some funny clips:

In Bitcoin, you can definitely see WhalePanda doing shit like this all the time; fostering tribalism, getting people to forget what game they're playing, and festering rumors. When you get good at these games, you can spot the people who do this. The biggest giveaway is when smart people stir up social grudges, instead of discussing winning the game. Winning is all that matters, social grudges are what stupids do to fit in and it gets them slaughtered.

WhalePanda is quite good at playing the game, and clearly is far above the need to hold a grudge - but at the same time is too cunning to forgo manipulating young bitcoin'ers into attacking people for his profit.

A lot of us who bought in way early care more about to the technology succeeding. The value in USD isn't the point. We're looking for consistency and stability. Such a huge flood of people came in and want the exact opposite, they obviously want the price to drastically increase. It's a difference in perspective.  I won't lie and pretend I haven't sold for profits, but that wasn't what I expected when I bought in, not so drastically anyway.  people more interested in investing, are the ones who made the price skyrocket and subsequently drop. They are the ones who came after and assigned their own ridiculous value to something that wasn't ready yet. investors define the value of actual units of crypto-currency much differenly than those of us who value the technology itself much more. It's weird seeing a group of people come in, make out the tech into something it's not, and then call those of us who didn't get into to crypto for fast cash in the first place, crazy. ;27;2;False;Joe303;ebv7uyd;My reaction to the price vs. everyone else's;a6gca5;https://i.imgur.com/aocjx.gif
