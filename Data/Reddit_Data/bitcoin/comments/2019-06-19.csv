"Can robinhood be hacked? Absolutely. For personal information and surely the ""bitcoin"" that they claim to house. 

In terms of safely investing, storing, and actually owning bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, you can easily register for an account on coinbase.com, gemini.com or a number of other ""reputable"" exchanges in the industry. It's VERY important to understand that these exchanges can be hacked the same way robinhood could except that you're not insured so your bitcoin effectively disappears. Important to note here that you never actually own the bitcoin you buy in robinhood because you cant take if off of their platform and place it  in your own wallet. The exchanges mentioned above are safe places to exchange your dollars for bitcoin etc. Its just important to not let your bitcoin sit on said exchange for an extended period.

It's worth it to use these other exchanges because you can actually own your bitcoin and do with it as you please. Trade for other currencies, buy things, etc. It is essential, though, that you remove your bitcoin from these exchanges after you've purchased them. You can create a number of wallets to store them on you're computer, but that is really no safer than it sitting on an exchange in regard to hacks because they care connected to the internet and your computer is subject to hack. The safest place for storage is offline in a cold wallet. One of the wallets that crypto holders prefer to use is the ledger nano s. 

I HEAVILY suggest that you watch some youtube videos on safe ways to store crypto before you do anything. Start learning and reading up.

Hope that helps.";1;0;False;lwc-wtang12;erjtkgs;It’s over 9000!!!!;buuwao;https://i.redd.it/720kzruvfd131.jpg

>The value of a Libra is meant to stay largely stable, so it’s a good medium of exchange, as merchants can be confident they won’t be paid a Libra today that’s then worth less tomorrow.

"You are missing the point. If you are open to having a serious discussion, read on. If not, close your laptop.

Bitcoin is the 'popular' coin over all the other coins. Facebook is wildly more popular than bitcoin. Now, I know the science behind bitcoin is great, but the actual intrinsic value and 'want' is determined by popularity. The ONLY reason bitcoin's price goes up is because more people WANT IT. There is zero difference between Cabbage patch dolls, or some other valuable thing, like, say, Picasso Paintings. Bitcoin could literally be Picasso Paintings. In 50 years, Picasso might not be as valued, just as Cabbage patch is today, jus as bitcoin might not be in 50 years. 

So, why did Cabbage Patch go from $35 to $10,000 at Christmas? because it was the popular thing. It was supply and demand, and there was demand. Bitcoin went to 20k because of demand and popularity. 

Now, you should be very afraid because Facebook could essentially launch ANYTHING and make it an instant success because they can literally advertise for free, to EVERYONE. That's trillions in free advertising to everyone on the planet. Bitcoin is ONLY advertised by word of mouth and reddit and by the Winklevoss. Imagine the facebook coin and how it will be so popular, like facebook. They could really upend banks, ruin the credit industry, and become so powerful because they will know how much money each person in the world has by the transactions they make. It's scary. 

So, if there was a TLDR, the reason Bitcoin raises is because more people buy in. People buy in because they not only believe in it's merits, but moreso the FOMO which is the arm of Popularity. When facebook launches a coin the FOMO will be so high it will be trillions. It will out perform anything Bitcoin (as a coin, not the technology) can do. It will take the bitcoin tech further faster than anyone else can. But it will also be a sad day indeed.

"Hang on, I think you are missing something.

Let's talk about Bitcoin's biggest selling point: that you can buy anything globally with bitcoin. This is of course, utter bullshit. For instance, I can use USD fiat to buy something in Chinese Fiat and it goes through an exchange based on the arbitrary strength of the dollar at the moment of transaction. If I use bitcoin, I have to use my fiat to buy bitcoin to buy the product, which then gets transferred back into Chinese Fiat at the end. So, really, the path from fiat to fiat is identical except there is bitcoin in the middle. Now, as long as we live in a country with it's own Fiat, fiat will never go away, and as long as fiat will never go away, there will always be a need to convert from bitcoin in and out of fiat. The thought is that one day I will get paid in bitcoin, buy groceries in bitcoin, and pay rent in bitcoin. It could happen, but then countries would go bankrupt. 

Now let us talk about whatever facebook does in the financial sector. Let's say, facebook creates 'toilet paper rolls'. So, you buy TPR's with your fiat, and you then can buy stuff from china using TPR's which can then be converted back into chinese fiat. It's no different at this point than bitcoin, so why use bitcoin? Plus if everyone decides that TPR is more popular than Bitcoin, then the price of TPR's goes through the roof and suddenly TPR's hit 20k. 

Now as you politely put it, 'people with a brain will understand this'. Have you seen the people on Facebook? We, as a race, are NOT intelligent. Not even a little bit. People waste their whole lives on Facebook and Reddit because they are addicted and stupid. Therefore, Toilet Paper Rolls, or whatever Facebook calls it, will undoubtedly crush but not kill, whatever other banking thing there is.";0;1;False;tommygunz007;erkq67u;But why would someone buy FacebookCoin, Mark??;c27kk9;https://www.blockcubed.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/mark-zuckerberg-uses-you.jpg
"> People with a brain will understand this. Those who just follow the hype will be caught up in the bs.

This is the key to what you're missing. The vast majority of people follow the hype and don't think. Personally, why Facebook has become so indispensable is beyond me, but despite the recent blows to its reputation it's still the dominant social media company, especially when you consider Instagram.

Plus, at the moment, most people right now prefer fiat--and for good reason as most people haven't developed the caution and tech-savvy necessary to handle Bitcoin safely. Most of the middle-aged moms who are active Facebook users shouldn't be in Bitcoin without some education anyway (and I say this as someone who's almost middle-aged and almost a mom). I wish it were otherwise, as we'd all be in a much better place if people could think things through and handle a little more complexity, but that's the reality of the world we live in now. Possibly Libra could serve as a gateway to Bitcoin, but people could just stay there too.

"Should have really been written SNs and not SNS. It was screen names, you used to put your AOL/AIM screen name in your profile and it'd be a common way to contact your classmates on Facebook since there was no messaging system yet. It wasn't until much later that pokes and messages were added. There wasn't even a feed or wall in the very early days, so it was literally a contact directory and sort of friend directory.

I was on Facebook back in 04-05 when it first started and there were tons of glitches that basically made everyone's info available to everyone else. The first limitations they put up were to just limit your profile to your friends, but they forgot or were too lazy to actually implement the same limitations for the mobile phone SMS system they briefly implemented...so everyone's profile including their phone #'s, screennames, e-mails, etc. were available to everyone else if you just bothered to use the SMS system.

Anyways, the original Facebook was a lot like Friendster, except you could put stupid shit in your profile about your interests and a relationship status.

In all this silliness, I have to say that I kind of miss AIM. You could go home and log on and chat when you wanted to, and when you didn't feel like it anymore you'd just log off. Made conversations much more immediate too because anybody signed on really did want to be online to chat, whereas now with texts/imessages/whatsapp people may or may not be near their phones and may or may not want to be chatting. So you had much more legitimate conversations that flowed much more like a real phone conversation. Which is of course another thing nobody does anymore.

Without knowing much about what Libra will look like in practice, especially in terms of international regulation, it's hard to say. If they cooperate with Venezuelan authorities, or if for some reason it's easier for the government to trace Libra activity, then people will prefer Bitcoin. But if Libra takes the stance that Venezuela is an outlaw state and they do not comply with any requests, and Venezuelans feel confident their money is safe there, then they might prefer Libra unless there's another compelling reason to use Bitcoin (they ideologically believe in the Bitcoin project, for example).
