"""... the deleted posting of a scared animal backed into a corner who has just been beaten and is admitting to anything anyone says so that the beatings will stop. Jordan is like a puppy licking the collective hand of reddit and whimpering so that maybe he won't get another crack across the face with a rolled up newspaper.""

In social engineering and in PR people tend to be told to defuse the situation quickly and without further conflict. He did say that there was fault on both sides , but did not go on to finger pointing, and accusations, which would have made it a huge fight that drags on. Besides, since when does an angry mob listen to anything after the fact? 

Admit you were wrong, make reparations, and wait for it to blow over. Path of least resistance. That's the path he took. When you are doxed, lied about, threatened with violence , and the collapse of your company you end the conflict as quickly as possible and learn your lesson. He's not the good guy, anyone can see that. He made some mistakes. The thing is people are running on the assumption that OP is this angelic poor soul who was horribly treated and ripped off. The reality is the OP was an abusive, lying , uncooperative , inexperienced and technologically ignorant customer ... and Jordan handled it badly, dropped the ball several times, and when he tried to make good on it his offer was thrown in his face when he was legally not obligated to do anything. The answers to his offers to fix the issues, and the initial refund offer ( cost -$5k ) was answered with inciting a mob to trash his name, reputation, employees, and a heavily edited version of events. In short he was scared, and made some bad decisions, that compounded and put him in a situation where the only option was to fall on his sword and take the loss. 

Does it sound like I think he was the good guy? Does it sound like I think either of them were the ' good guy ' ? There were no good guys in this situation. It was a clash of an inexperienced businesskid who made a mess of a bad situation , and a tech/bitcoin inexperienced  customer who needed someone to blame , and had to rely on lying to a mob to get what he wanted.
