"If you were someone of influence you wouldn't be arguing with nerds on an internet money subreddit. 

The great thing about bitcoin is that is made up of people of *no* influence. The technology has the influence the people spread the 'idea'.

You see, the reality of wealth exists as much in our imagination as it does in the physical world. The construct of our stories and our memes and ideas spread to the far corners of this globe. For when people imagine wealth to be something different tomorrow than what is imagined today, reality changes with it.

"Since you loved my wisdom so much here is some more (for free):
Bitcoin has taught me that money is the ultimate delusion, a shared hallucination. I have watched my 'wealth' go from nothing to riches to nothing to riches many times over. It has reaffirmed to me that true value comes from fulfillment and purpose and that money has very little to do with that. Cherish your friends and love your family because the world is about to fade away. 

The love of money is the type of evil that clouds your mind. It makes you incapable of empathy that is required to repair our world and love others. 

It isn't the money itself that is evil, it is your fear of losing it. For the fear of losing wealth is what motivates some of the worst things imaginable.

How i spend my money is nobody's business. We shouldn't have to invent BitCoin to enforce privacy. 

Governments should do the right thing simply because it's the right thing to go. Instead we use technology to drag the government, kicking and screaming, into doing the right thing.

"You're a programmer, and your company is hired to develop software for a customer.

You develop it.

I think it's wrong to prevent money laundering, or financing of terrorism. But in the end i'm trying to make the job of the anti-money laundering team easier.

I try to develop software to make people's live better.

And BitCoin developers have the same goal: to get rid of government regulation on the flow of money to make people's lives easier.

"Financing of terrorism is an unavoidable consequence of freedom.

People love to try to the extreme example as a reason not to have something.

- you can't have free speech: because child porn
- you can't have encryption: because criminals
- you can't have cryptocurrency: because financing of terrorism

Well these Technologies are here, and they're staying. They have benefits that are staying. And people can use them for bad things as well. 

-:We're not going to ban the technology because of the bad things that could happen. We're just not.
- That means you're going to have to accept the bad things. You just are.

So rather than dick around with these arguments, I just negate them:

- yes the government is not allowed to have a microphone in everyone's bedroom
- yes that means they could be planning a crime
- I don't care
- them planning a crime is allowed
- it is right and good they're able to plan a crime
- because if they weren't it means we were in a very bad world

So that's how we got here.

- It is right and good that people can use cash to avoid paying taxes
- it is right and good that Free Speech means someone can say Donald Trump is bald
- it is right and good that Apple won't unlock the phone of the San Bernardino terrorists
- it is right and good that TOR allows silkroad website to sell products
- it is right and good that Banks don't report my private transactions to the government


It is right and good that people can Finance terrorists.

Also there can be senior people who had no idea about it. To make blanket statements about jailing the CEO is stupid. The CEO can't and will never know what all employees are doing at all times. 

Then you have junior people that may have opened accounts at their bosses instructions and they should definitely not go to jail.

"Well, that's really unfortunate to hear. But this is basically standard practice in the Dutch banking industry and probably applies to other West-European banks as well. All Dutch banks (Rabobank, ABN AMRO, ING, De Volksbank, NIBC, etc.) have to conduct due diligence and check background of their (potential) customers. Since Iran is sort of ""blacklisted"" in the Dutch banking register, they have to scrutinise each transaction that have being made from Iran to the Netherlands and vice versa. I know it's extremely frustrating for you but in this case Rabobank just can't afford to receive another hefty fine for reluctant due diligence. So, the principle of ""safety first"" applies here though.

"> Because people become the bad guy when they decide to profit from their hard work and changing the world? 

Yep.  Because they naturally are forced to compromise and con people to make a profit.  

Remember profit requires us to take more than we give in value.

And why would we want to agree?  That would make life useless to have everyone thinking the same way.

For the record, I'm beyond political competitiveness.  I'm an organismist, which is where we have a collaborative system where everyone is free to do what they want, rather than having to compete with one's friends and family and neighbors on the planet to get crappy stuff the way it is now.

Collaborative, free systems are the only systems that have been shown to work exceptionally well over the billions of years of life on Earth.  Evolution knows what it's doing.  It's just very slow and methodical, having to try all possible options (random mutations) before naturally selecting the ones that fit in the best with all the others.  So the dinosaur meme of being as large as possible and taking more than one gives back is going extinct as us more creative, collaborative, playful types, like Musk is in his heart, are ready to take over and create a free, flourishing planet.";1;0;False;Turil;du1cxwa;This video of old school astronauts criticizing Elon saying he'll fail reminds me of Warren Buffett and others saying Crypto will fail;7wavza;https://youtu.be/CyGqMZQAMio

"Competition drives desperation and cheating and wasting resources.  Which is why our planet is so fucked up now, including our society and human health.

Collaboration to solve shared problems, on the other hand, drives creativity and innovation and effective use of resources.

"It's funny people have such unwavering faith in Satoshi Nakamotos vision when he abandoned the project years ago, and built much of the project based on guesses that turned out to be badly wrong.

In what other field of tech did one of the very first versions of a type of software survive by dogmatically clinging to the original design plan of the first developer who then left the project unfinished?

Things like the 1mb block limit were instated simply as a short term band aid that were never meant to be permanent, but have now become enshrined as doctrines of the faith because Satoshi implemented it and his vision is perfect and infallible.

Now people are adamant that the 1mb block limit must stay and that the solution must work around that limit despite the fact the person who implemented that limit never intended it to be permanent.

In no other aspect of tech would people have such blind confidence in the success of such an outdated and infrequently updated software to stay relevant and not be replaced.

The only thing Satoshi managed to get right was that if you have an exponentially decreasing supply curve then you can initiate a deflationary spiral that will encourage speculation and hoarding that will increase price, which comes at the expense of actually being functional. He clearly had very little knowledge of economics since his white paper makes no reference to bitcoin being a ""store of value"" or speculative asset, he intended it to be a p2p currency which is mutually exclusive with something where the incentive is to hoard, not spend it.";2;0;False;suninabox;du1fwpd;This video of old school astronauts criticizing Elon saying he'll fail reminds me of Warren Buffett and others saying Crypto will fail;7wavza;https://youtu.be/CyGqMZQAMio

Banks were forced to provide 0 balance accounts to people by the government. I remember banks rejecting my new account request before. But after the government regulation came in called the 'jan dhan yojna', bankers were going out to get people to create new accounts. It did help banks to recapitalize after having billions in NPAs but then they had to pay interests out to everyone so they had to reduce interest rates. This did help a lot of youngsters secure business loans at a very low interest rates and helped people settle themselves. Basically it's not in banks interest to provide accounts to country's poor. It was the government forcing them that they did. ;20;1;False;harshgandhiin;du1ij5r;Nobody blames a currency when criminals launder money, but if they used BitCoin suddenly it’s a BitCoin problem;7wlmog;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7wlmog/nobody_blames_a_currency_when_criminals_launder/

Indian here. The government did try a lot to bring the unbanked to the banking sector. With 0 fee accounts and life insurance at about 1rupee per month, all noble causes. But then they wanted everyone to stop using cash & start using digital payments & that ain't happening. Sure the amount of digital payments increased drastically after demonetization, but cash starvation almost killed many markets. Markets gained momentum only when cash started flowing more into these markets. Government forgets that cash is the ultimate peer to peer, fungible currency.

"Nobody was ever blaming the internet for murders. The closest thing I can think of was the hysteria around predators hiding within chatrooms, which is actually still just as prevalent today, but we perhaps don't hear about it quite so much anymore because chat rooms aren't really much of a thing anymore. But people are certainly not 'over' the fear of predatorily behaviour taking advantage of the increased anonymity provided by the internet.

The point is, which you seem to be completely missing, many of the founding principle of bitcoin, namely that it has no censorship, it is permission-less (there are no arbitrary gate keepers controlling where coins can or can not go), it is based around the concept of Pseudonymous (no ID required to use or own), and that transactions are irreversible, make bitcoin a veritable paradise for those wishing to do things with their money they shouldn't be doing. Of course, these people are going to be doing dodgy shit with their money no matter what, but giving them a tool that makes it so much easier, is definitely something that needs to be seriously looked into.

"Same argument the NRA makes about the press and scary looking guns.  Violence would happen with or without those particular weapons just as money laundering would occur using [holding company owned accounts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama_Papers), cash, [blockchain ledger](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-08/irs-cops-scouring-crypto-accounts-to-build-tax-evasion-cases), [commodities](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/technology/science/honey-laundering-the-sour-side-of-natures-golden-sweetener/article562759/#articlecontent) or precious metals.

**This is why I am in favor of stricter gun laws. Because the argument is absurd.** Furthermore just as a 20 round magazine affords extra capabilities to a weapon that includes it as a feature, blockchain adds abilities that cash doesn't have.  So perhaps blockchain *does* facilitate money laundering.

"finding the source for something like this isnt that easy, i just tried and i couldnt find it in a couple minutes, much less 10 seconds.

the media has been spewing really bad estimates based on bad math again and again, so going with some random % quoted in an aritcle doesnt really tell us much, id like to look at the specific source you are using and judge their math myself

"No, mining a block, and thus reaching consensus in a constantly under attack network takes an enormous amount of energy, which is what makes it work. The number of transactions that can be represented by a single settlement transaction is infinite so pretending to extrapolate it to individual transactions just shows you clearly have a very limited understanding of the protocol. The cost of that energy is what aligns the economic incentives to make the system work. It’s why eth also has POW. POS has yet to be proven and is a pipe dream. 

And it takes the protocol 10 minutes to come to absolute global consensus. That’s not long at all.
