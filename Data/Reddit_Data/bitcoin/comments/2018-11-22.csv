"Odd that no one mentioned the BCH fork... There was a branch of Bitcoin that split off a while ago and has been in the top 5 spot (Bitcoin Cash). It stemmed from a disagreement about what Bitcoin should be and if it's true to the original vision of the whitepaper. Well, the people in charge of that split off branch of Bitcoin could not agree between themselves what BCH should be, so that was split off also into BCH ABC and BCH SV. The people involved had a lot of influence in terms of mining power and mining pools, and the accepted theory was that whichever of those forks of BCH had the most hashing power post-fork would be the winner and would be the accepted standard BCH.

Well, the ASICs that mine Bitcoin can also mine BCH, and what happened and is still happening, is a hash war. Mining hardware was pulled off mining bitcoin to mine BCH to secure a winner in this war, which triggered uncertainty in the market.

This happened after the price of BCH spiked, as the fork announcement was widely known, and after the fork, you get to keep both branches of BCH effectively doubling your crypto, but at the same time, the price spike is artificial and greed driven, and after the fork occurs, the price can't stay that high, so people sell it off ASAP because they only bought in to grab some profit off it. Huge selloffs in one crypto can often instil panic elsewhere.

It's a lot of factors, but I think the BCH fork injected panic where it didn't need to exist.";13;2;False;Voidward;ea8y8ry;It was a nice ride;9zd9am;https://i.imgur.com/6QqBbp9.jpg

"simplified:

there is no price of Bitcoin yet.

I am not able to formulate my response into ELI5 format, maybe someone more knowledgable could help simplifying what I am trying to say, but:

&#x200B;

There is only price of Bitcoin in FIAT. This value is calculated from  buying and selling transactions in real time. So this way, price in USD of ALL bitcoins is determined by trading a fraction of them valued at the moment. This method of measuring price does not consider people that are not selling because they don't want to, and people not buying because they already have enough.

we need to get off the USD reference frame (as a mind experiment for now to see the implication). Bitcoin will have value of itself when it could be generally said at some particular place that good espresso is 10 Sats, 30 Sats is too expensive and touristy, and less than 5 Sats expect a pisswater of coffee. This needs stable prices in Sats.

when BTC/USD price swings, it is hard to keep the coffee's price stable in BTC only if you operate in FIAT and just accept BTC. But a coffee place that pays utilities settled in BTC, buys coffee beans in BTC and pays employees in BTC would not have this issue, correct?

creating a value-based reference for Bitcoin by pricing goods and services will not be too welcomed at the beginning, and it would require a significant adoption (just more people using Bitcoin really) and a higher USD price even to begin in forming a value reference frame.

&#x200B;

when you will commonly see ads for products priced in BTC, you might wonder how much USD is needed to get x amount of BTC to get that product from the ad. Until then, it will be fairly dramatic. To answer you question,

>Why didn't it go back to pre-2017 levels?

nobody knows and it can at any time, but what does a ticker price on centralized exchange mean, really?

>If you study what happens when currencies compete--specifically when hard and soft currencies are in competition, you can clearly see what happens. The hard currency always wins.

Bitcoin isn't a hard currency, and arguably not a soft currency or even currency. Even if this is an absolute rule, it either, has no relevance to bitcoin, or it means the USD would always win in competition to bitcoin.

>Bitcoin is going to destroy every other currency and is going to necessarily be worth more than all other currencies because it is better than all of them. Bitcoin will be worth 90 trillion+ in 10 years.

Based on what? How is it going to destroy them? Bitcoin is inanimate and incapable of attacking something.

>I don't need to convince you or anyone; it will simply happen. And when it does you will be confused and wont understand why. You will say it was luck or that no one could have known Bitcoin would take over. Fuck that, I know and a lot of other people know. It's clear as day. Sorry you don't see it.

You absolutely do need to convince me and everyone, or a majority of people. That's the only way a speculative asset, what bitcoin has become, can gain value. You need to convincing people to buy it for more than you spent, or more than you think it's worth. Incoherent ramblings and invalid arguments, spouting bullshit don't convince anyone, or anyone for long enough to make it sustainable.

Bitcoins value is that it introduced a new technology and new way of thinking about the security and principals of your money. A problem arises that most people haven't adhered or care about the original principals. Centralisation is rampant, including wallets, mining power, and exchanges. Exchanges have led to it's deterioration as pseudonymous. It's viewed as a way to get rich, not as a medium of exchange. Many of the same fiat institutions and flaws satoshi wanted to disrupt have made their way into the bitcoin market.

Many of the underlying technology principals introduced by bitcoin can and will have a tremendous impact on the ways we govern, conduct business, and hopefully monetary institutions, all while benefiting the greatest number of people. Unfortunately that does not make the Bitcoins you hold more valuable.

Even the open source principal hasn't been adopted or contributed like originally hoped. Few people contribute to the source code, and not a lot has changed. For technology to succeed it needs to continue to innovate, and respond to the changing market. Changes to the core should have prevented the centralisation of mining efforts. Further core changes to the core should have enhanced the privacy. No where did satoshi say the fundamentals need to stay the same. In fact the opposite occurred, the ability to fork is part of bitcoin, and allows miners and holders to vote with their mining power and adoption.

I really hope a decentralised and opensource  crypto currency becomes main stream. But I do not believe it will be bitcoin. There is a probability that Bitcoin will bubble again, enough that I still have a small percentage, it's FOMO. But there is a higher probability that it falls further with the chance of not recovering. And if it bubbles again, there's an absolute certainty that it will crash again.

Bitcoin price will never come back up. It is a simple economics law. You have more and more substitutes (altcoins) which necessarily has a negative impact on the price of bitcoin because people like to diversify by selling bitcoin to buy altcoins if they stay in the crypto trades. Otherwise they cash in to consume something or buy other assets that are more tangible. Altcoins that get released always have improved features over bitcoin, so people will rather jump ship on them and it is expected to be more speculatively profitable. The similar argument goes for etheurem but the negative effect will be smaller because it has a better features.;1;1;False;Ikuyas;ea8v4x0;It was a nice ride;9zd9am;https://i.imgur.com/6QqBbp9.jpg

Can anyone give a EIL5 (or Explain It Like I'm a busy adult that hasn't done a lot of research but would like to understand more) explination of a couple things for me? 

Why did bitcoin suddenly take such a dramatic dive? I understand the dramatic peak last year with all the publicity and regulatory acceptance. I understand the slow decline from that peak as it normalized to a more 'real' value'. But why such a dramatic drop? I didn't see any news about ""Satoshi discovered to actually be a 6 year old indonesian girl who made the whole thing up"" or some other craziness. (lol)

And then also the followup question: If it's ""failing"", then why didn't it fail all the way to Zero? or perhaps the better question, why did it drop to 4k and stop dropping? Why didn't it go back to pre-2017 levels? 

Any way, I was hoping to hear some thoughts from people who are more knowledgeable than me. I own no bitcoin or digital currency, but I do think it's all very historic.";45;14;False;jaeldi;ea8hws0;It was a nice ride;9zd9am;https://i.imgur.com/6QqBbp9.jpg

"That's economically backwards thinking, and more in line with Keynesianism, which Bitcoin is in opposition to.

People value currencies with greater liquidity. Hodling increases liquidity. Spending/selling decreases liquidity. It's literally getting rid of the thing you claim to value, which is hypocritical.

Bitcoin **is** an investment. That's how a currency is bootstrapped from 0 to world domination- enough people hodl it.

"I didn't get into into Bitcoin for a digital gold story. I got in it for electronic cash - like nearly everyone else around that time. 

The drive up to 20k in late 2017? Yes, of course that's the get rich quick fools, many of whom bought into the digital gold story. THAT is also cherry-picking. I'm quite sure during 2013-2016 price was driven by what I described in my last post. If not actual wide-spread use yet, then at least the expectation of such as we all could witness the momentum build up. (overshadowed by a few major events like the MtGox collapse) That all ground to a halt when it became clear core would rather strangle Bitcoin's usability to death than keep the momentum and ride the adoption wave. Instead they started pushing the store of value / digital gold / layer-two stories.

But no, Bitcoin's strength is NOT to be a digital gold without any usability value to back it up. The foolishness of that position you are witnessing live these days. Gold itself is volatile enough, but show me in which decade it had [multiple 80%+ crashes](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9z4icx/bitcoin_crashes/)! That volatility in Bitcoin is not going to go away as long there is nothing else to stabilize it. Just speculating on it being ""gold"" will just lead right to the next speculation bubble and crash. Stability would come from widespread commercial use, sustained high-volume of buying and selling, where someone dumping 1000 coins barely makes a blip on the market. That's when you get the digital gold properties as cream on the top. Instead, today, among nothing but gold-only dreamers, you dump 1000 coins and watch the price tank. 

As for being able to ""buy things satisfactorily with cash and cards"" - you need to realize that a) USA ≠ the world and b) the definition of ""satisfactorily"" is highly subjective. 

There are billions of people who don't have access to credit cards and bank accounts and would still like to have a way to participate in e-commerce and other transactions at a distance. People who live with hyper-inflation and see their cash turn to toilet paper, just ask in Venzuela, Argentina, or several places in Africa like Zimbabwe. 

And even in the West, I, for example, don't appreciate having my [credit card transaction records sold to the highest bidder](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-30/google-and-mastercard-cut-a-secret-ad-deal-to-track-retail-sales) (and btw [Mastercard has been doing this for years](https://adage.com/article/news/marketing-mastercard-launches-data-service-marketers/141512/)) or get [threatened and have my accounts frozen for buying the wrong coffee](https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/perth-coffee-shop-users-violating-cuba-trade-law-1-3640707). Bitcoin was supposed to remedy these things. Electronic cash - uncensorable, (semi-)anonymous, [global, fast, cheap](https://i.imgur.com/bjRILt4.png). That's where Bitcoin's strengths lie.

You could use a tumbler if you do though better make sure its one you can trust. I would do it 50 at a time. They have been known to keep peoples bitcoin. You could use local bitcoins and buy in cash. The best way is to get a monero wallet. Change your bitcoin to monero with morphtoken its like shapeshift no id required. After you do that use xmr.to to change it back to a bitcoin wallet you own. Make sure this  is done using a no log vpn or tor. I would recomend Nord VPN. This will hide your true ip address which can be used to find out who you are. Here is a link to Morphtoken https://www.morphtoken.com/ This should keep you somewhat safe. Unless the government is after you. I dont think you have to worry about that. I hope.

>The drive up to 20k in late 2017? Yes, of course that's the get rich quick fools, many of whom bought into the digital gold story. THAT is also cherry-picking. 

The crash is the result of that incessant buying. So if it's cherry-picking so is your example.

The developers want to put decentralisation and security above everything else and good for them. A payment system (if you want that) needs a strong foundation.

The rise in 2016 I think was due to the last halving.

"Well the article certainly does enough to make me evaluate my positions.

First of all by the definition of liquidity, holding decreases liquidity. The article is specifically saying that by getting greedy, holding Bitcoin and decreasing liquidity, eventually everyone will value Bitcoin highly and success will have occurred. At that point liquidity will be high.

I disagree with this in a couple ways. First of all, spending is not trying to get rid of something you claim to value. It is a *demonstration* of its value as well, as a merchant is then exposed to the ways in which Bitcoin is better than fiat (of course this assumes Bitcoin actually does have practical advantages over the dollar that a merchant would value). Secondly if everyone passively holds, how do new people become exposed to the possibility of using Bitcoin instead of the dollar?

It seems to me that for everyone to value Bitcoin more, more people need to know about it and need to know how to use it, need to know that it's useful, rather than the people who already know how to use it hoarding it. And spending and buying accomplishes this.

But maybe I'm wrong and everybody needs to just keep being greedy until eventually someone wants to spend their millions. But we've seen with the dollar, hoarders often don't want to spend. I don't feel that's a recipe for BTC to become the dominant currency.

"> Pretty much every definition of currency describes it as being circulated and being used for trade. A currency just sitting somewhere isn't being used for trade. This one of the reasons why gold, from your other thread, isn't a currency, but a commodity. If Bitcoin isn't actively used in trade, isn't a commodity with intrinsic value and isn't some kind of replacement for stock (see ICO's), **then it shouldn't have any value.**

Emphasis mine. And yet it does, so you can either continue to be an ignorant sheep that keeps spewing nonsensical Keynesian ideas about how money must change hands frequently....

Or you can revisit your assumption because the market clearly seems to think that Bitcoin has a lot of value and that value has been increasing over time from zero at its inception.

You need to understand that it does not matter at all how frequently a currency is exchanged.  Look at Rai stones.  Look at what happens to currencies when they die via hyperinflation.  Do they stop being traded and then lose their value?  Or...do they keep getting exchanged at higher and higher frequency until their value is completely zero and no one will accept or hold said currency?

"> You are right that currencies with other uses are bad, that's why we don't use bullets as currency for instance, because the manufacturing of it would need to be faster than the firing of it, or else it would disappear.

That's not why.


> 
> You are not correct, however, in your assessment that a currency that is hoarded is doing its job. By definition, if it doesn't circulate, and do so often enough, it's not a currency.


...Go read about Rai stones which very rarely circulate and come back and tell me they are not a currency or money.  I am so sick of this ignorant fucking Keynesians going around spewing this bullshit idea that a currency MUST circulate in order to be a currency.  No, it doesn't and if you believe it does you are just fucking oblivious.

> 
> I'll give you an example: take something valuable, that always increases in value over time, like real estate. ¿Would real estate be viable as a currency? Nope.

Yes, RE is a an example of a currency in that it has both utility or ""non-monetary"" value and monetary value.  People often buy RE as a long term store of value because they don't have access to better alternatives like sound money.  Bitcoin will eliminate the portion of value of RE that comes from its function as currency.  Same is true for art.


> 
> Controlled inflation is actually 10x better for the economy that a fixed deflation rate. Coca-Cola cost exactly $0.05 a bottle for nearly 60 years in the US. In that time, those 5 cents came to be worth much less than before, but because the rest of the economy developed, and new categories of more complex, niche goods arose, basic products like bread, milk or Coca-Cola could keep their nominal cost.

Get the fuck out of here with your Keynesian garbage ideas.  Markets are not static or stable.  Markets relying on price signaling to solve countless Supply-x-Demand equations.  If because of increased productive manufacturing a Coke becomes less expensive, then that should be communicated to the market via price changes.  When you keep fucking with price you distort this market signal and introduce inefficiencies.  You ALSO give a HUGE advantage to the holders of the newly created money--which, spoiler alert: IS NOT YOU.  Where do you think this advantage comes from?  Do you think it falls out of the sky?  Spenders of newly created money acquire their purchasing power from dumbfuck holders of the existing supply of said inflationary currency.

I'll tell you what, you keep holding your dumbfuck soft inflationary money, and I'll keep holding my immortal hard deflationary magic internet money and we will come back in 10 years and see who was right and who is an ignorant jackass.  Deal?

> 
> I do agree though that current rates of inflation are unsustainable, but something like 0.75% of annual inflation on an economy with a size that of the US, for instance, and with added redenominations once every 100 years that could return the value of the currency to its previous state, would be quite viable.

What is the end supply of a currency that has 0.75%/yr inflation?  The answer is that the supply is infinite.  

If people have a choice between a soft money w/ 75 basis points of inflation and a hard money with zero inflation, the hard money will win out EVERY TIME, and the inflationary garbage will be reduced to zero because it cannot compete against 0 inflation.

" I think both are playing their part really tho. The hodlers keep the price up, they are the floor of the market which is important, they give it stability. But the drug dealers are actually using the coin for its intended purpose thus creating movement in the market which it also cant live with out. 
Also their are plenty of non drug dealers using it for normal reasons and they probably play the bigger roll. Im sure plenty of them are accumulating and utelizing it simultaneously.

Please forgive me if this is an obvious question but I'm genuinely curious.  To those who do buy illicit drugs online....where are you having them shipped to?  Seems super risky to have them shipped to your home since the package could be screened and intercepted on the way to you which would land you in a world of trouble.  Only option I can think of is a private PO box, however, that's an expensive service to pay for which would more than erase any money saved from purchasing online.  Or am I missing something here?

And if you'd prefer to cherry-pick other years, I'll gladly point out that throughout most of Bitcoin's history the price was in fact driven by actual or expected commercial activity. Beginning with the 10,000-BTC pizza, adoption, adoption, adoption was the mantra and every large new merchant was widely celebrated including right here in this sub. Dell, Expedia, Overstock, Microsoft, Valve/Steam, Braintree/Paypal etc., etc. Oh, isn't tomorrow Black Friday? I remember when Bitcoin Black Friday was a big deal and staggering BTC revenue numbers were all over the crypto news. Those big wins often triggered an upswing in price. 

Today? Many of those merchants stopped accepting Bitcoin, Bitcoin Black Friday is a mere shell of its former self and the price tanked throughout the whole year. Congrats to your store of value! Hope you didn't store too much though.

Wiring money into an exchange is a painful experience and we agree on that. I even add an extra step that makes me do usual bank account to small tier bank account to exchange (3 steps). That because I don't want my usual bank to shut my main account without warning.

">and now even its largest backers would rather not risk future gains by using it as a currency

I need to eat.  I need to pay rent.  I need to have entertainment.  I fulfil these needs by paying for them with money.

There are two kinds of money that these services will accept from me: Euro or Bitcoin.  Regardless of which one I use, I now have less money than I did before.  As it happens, I prefer not to hold any euro, so I use bitcoin.

This preference is actually implicit in the statement that it's preferable to pay euro/dollars instead of bitcoin - you want to get rid of the least sound money first.  I just take it one step further by getting rid of all my euro whenever I have it and living on bitcoin.  So in my situation, I most certainly do use bitcoin as a currency, because it's the only currency I have.

"Did merchant adoption drive the price to 20k? Of course not - get rich quick fools put in their live savings (then panic sold when it dropped in price - tarnishing Bitcoin's name on the way). So did Bitcoin drop because it had been debased or because it had been severely overbought? Several merchants adopted it in 2015. It didn't make any difference to the price.

The price has nothing to do with merchant indifference because this does not matter a jot to Bitcoin.  It's not where Bitcoin's strengths lie. It's more of a digital gold. You can already buy things satisfactorily with cash and cards, so what need for another method?

"> No it doesn't. Just because there's the slightest ""change in magnitude of State influence"" doesn't mean law enforcement is eliminated. Do you know what a small percentage of taxes go toward things like police to prevent/solve thefts, murders, etc? Do you know that there are more private police than public police?

I feel like you're a victim of the common libertarian flaw/shortcoming, which is understanding government as a relationship between an authority structure and individual citizens. Naturally it's more complex than that and deals in the aggregate, with many different entities including business, zoning, etc. Your relationship to government isn't you vs. them, and naturally the ""law"" isn't just policing property and transnational relationships between individuals. 

We're talking about public policy here, and the libertarian position is ""there should be less of it""

> No, the owners and residential associations can make people drive the speed limit under even the most extreme forms of libertarianism

Ah yes - back to the naive and very faith-based premise that a private-sector, fund-raised option can not only replace a public one, but do a better job at it in a more ethical and trustworthy manner. Using the libertarian technique of course that a few gated communities in Florida are proof that every neighbourhood ought to carve out its only little volunteer private police village funded by voluntarily donations by home owners, via an HOA, to fund a mercenary speed limit enforcement force.

What a sensible vision! Silly me for thinking that is absolutely ridiculous. 

> So in other words, if someone looks at evidence, arguments, facts, and comes up with any conclusion other than yours, you will always dismiss it as 'faith'. 

No - if someone extrapolates recklessly as ""proof"" that private individuals will voluntarily cooperate and always figure out grass roots market-based solutions as laughably nonsensical as individual residential neighborhoods passing the hat around and funding their own private mercenary speed enforcement, I will dismiss them.

Just as I would if some hippie argued that, because they subsistence farm their own sweet potatoes, we somehow don't need the food industry because their little example is ""proof"" that it can work anywhere. 

Wreckless extrapolation is a common afflicition of fundamenatlists and dreamers, a category I think it's very clear libertarians fit within. A thirst for a made up better world (dreaming), founded upon very simple (fundamental) ideas, and a faith that it will work out and is worth pursuing (religious fundamentalism) 

> The fact that you think that ""hey, let's work out a solution to fires together"" means ""we'll use a bucket brigade and obviously nothing else,"" is ridiculous

You essentially proposed a bucket briage solution to the speeding through the residential neighbourhood example.

""Let's away with the monopoly and start taking turns to develop a home-grown option that's best for our immediate geographic region,  based on the expectation of sufficient voluntarily participation and adequate voluntarily donations! A shitty option that is voluntarily participated in by free individuals and funded by choice is ALWAYS superior to one that may be superior in getting the job done, but eliminates the power of individuals to choose and shape the option"" 

That's a real warm and fuzzy premise you've got there, neighbour. Volunteer fire departments work out in extremely rural areas, so naturally we can all have them everywhere. Each block could have its own fire hall and we can all take turns helping each other out :) If that doesn't work, we can send out volunteer fire-fundraising group captains once a year to raise money to pay for a private fire fighting service. The kids can do a bake sale and the grownups can sell wrapping paper :) 

As long as we can hug after. 


At the end of the day, your core ideology is founded on the premise that laws and regulations and policies are, to a great extent, in a number of places where they are either unnecessary, ineffectual, or downright harmful, and that they got there solely based on the meddlesome proactive expansion of the state (possibly facilitated by monied interests and other sinister undemocratic forces). It's a mix of overly simplistic reductionism, reckless extrapolation of isolated local case studies, juvenile contrarianism against authority, and good old fashioned ignorance-fueled conspiracy theories.

I'll never forget the shining example of a libertarian analysis of why phosphates have been banned in detergent (as taken from Reason itself). ""Because the government hates your freedom of choice, loves to control you and, doesn't want you to have clean dishes""

Can't put much stuck into people who think we all automatically cooperate and that the only reason we don't is because there's a corrupt authority structure hell-bent on stealing as much freedom and money as it can from us

"The problem with analogies, particularly with radically different techs, is they can lead to invalid conclusions. I think where you've taken this is an example.

> The only problem is, if you had invested in Archie in 1991 (Or Bunyip I guess, which was the company), you would now have... well you'd have nothing

I'd argue that investing in Bitcoin is more like investing in TCP/IP, if such a thing had been possible, where in our stretched analogy IP is the fundamental technological concepts of crypto/blockchain and TCP is the Bitcoin-specific implementation of it.

Of course with the net, that wasn't a realistic option, but because of the unique nature of crypto, investing in the *base* of the stack is not only an option, it's in fact a necessary condition for the whole thing to work. Without the financial incentive attached to the base layer the entire thing falls apart.

We *still* use TCP/IP to underpin the whole infrastructure today. Not because it is the best protocol but because it was the first working agreed upon option and has since become the most ubiquitous by far. Moving away from it is more expensive than putting up with its limitations. You can call me a maximalist but that's where I see Bitcoin still being in 20 years. Underpinning the whole infrastructure of most everything else built on crypto.

The equivalent to Archie in our analogy would be more like LN or other 2nd layer stuff. And sure, I have no idea if LN is the Archie or the HTTP of this broken analogy :) It could be wildly successful and open up new horizons of usage or it might just be a blip on the roadside of failed developments.

> Right now the investment is in a single currency. So, you're all betting that a new crypto currency WON'T come along that has better technology fundamentals, and captures the market, before Bitcoin establishes itself enough to be untouchable

Of course. But since this has already happened more than once and not yet displaced Bitcoin, it's not an unreasonable bet. We've already seen some ""UDP/IP"" contenders come along that will likely have a permanent niche in future crypto infrastructure, but nothing has come close to denting the first-mover advantage for Bitcoin. The network effect is real and critical, and just like TCP/IP, every time someone builds a new thing on top of Bitcoin it gets that much less likely that it will be trivially replaced by something as boring as a minor technological improvement.

And the reason for this is straightforward (to a maximalist, anyway), though it gets lost in the scams, hype, and "".com"" nonsense of crypto. The only practical reason crypto exists is to have a system with attack-resistant, trust-less, and permission-less transactions. It is literally the least efficient method imaginable to manage transactions if you don't care about those properties. And on those properties alone it is *extremely* difficult to displace Bitcoin because to do so would mean starting from scratch on several of those issues.";1;1;False;nezroy;ea8vbn5;What happened the emphasis of spending bitcoin on this sub?;9ys0y5;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9ys0y5/what_happened_the_emphasis_of_spending_bitcoin_on/
