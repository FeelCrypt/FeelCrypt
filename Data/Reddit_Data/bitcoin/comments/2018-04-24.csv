">I was on their side for a considerable amount of time. I was in the bitcoin game early on when it was all ""freedom and decentralization and libertarian festivals and down with the big banks the internet of money is going to help everyone out of poverty! Everyone can be their own bank! Alpaca socks!""

I don't think you were early if this is what was happening. I've been involved in some way or another since 2010, and back then, bitcoin wasn't decentralization, libertarians, or freedom. 

the only goal that was common among everyone back then was transparency. Mainly because the opaqueness of the banking industry is what exacerbated the 2007-2009 housing crash. 

>I'm paraphrasing of course, but fees continued to climb. And the community's focus had changed. And even back in 2015 everyone was blindly hyping some apparent vaporware 'lightning network' which, back then, everyone insisted was ""Just around the corner!"" and ""Lightning Network will fix this! It'll fix everything! We promise! I saw a YouTube video on it once!"", when just increasing the damn block size like Satoshi had left as an option seemed like it would immediately result in lowering fees back to economically moot levels like they had been originally.

You're missing the point here though. While fees increasing is a very real problem, the solution you take to dealing with them is important. 

Increasing the block size inevitably leads to a concentration in mining power, because the hardware required to stay competitive increases as block size increases. While this decentralization effect is not particularly important to bitcoins future on it's own, the effects it creates are extremely important. 

As concentration of mining increase, so does concentration of bitcoin wealth. As fewer and fewer parties have control over more and more bitcoin, incentives become perverse. Similar to how monopolistic firms cause deadweight loss in ecomomics due to pricing issues. 

A system of ever increasing block sizes will inevitably cause perverse incentives; that is, incentives that encourage reducing transparency. Which, undeniably, IS the main focus of bitcoin, whether you view it as a currency, or as a store of value. 

If bitcoin doesn't do its job as a transparent and secure currency, the fees are inconsequential. They could be zero, and nobody would use the coin. 

bitcoin cash as a solution would be like your doctor putting a band-aid on your tongue because you have herpes. it does nothing to fix the core problem, nor prevent future problems associated with it.

if the market isnt consistently going up and the last dip was recent than businesses wont want to use bitcoins. they sell you something for $20 in bitoins and by the time they convert the bitcoins to usd its now only worth $15 - any fees they also have to pay.

Bitcoin doesn't have any deflation, and the inflation is set in stone without a hard fork change.

The coin itself is pretty much the most stable currency concept in the world, it's the value of everything else relative to bitcoin that's so unstable it makes using bitcoin as a currency today unreliable. Fiat is far more versatile in that specific regard, as fiat policies can be changed with changing political or economic climates.

"Generalizing a lot here, but I am trying to be fairly neutral with my response:

BTC believes in offchain scaling, Lighting Network and smaller block sizes (and more efficient use of that block size), and generally thinks that any pain today (from high fees, slow transaction times, etc) are worth it now (read: early stage adoption) in order to have a leaner, more efficient chain in the future.


BCH largely sees the limiting of blocksizes as an artificial cap in order to make fees higher and allow the core team to push the lightning network. BCH has larger blocks that are used less efficiently (no segwit) which has relieved the pain now (really low fees, faster transaction times during times of congestion, etc and does not have ""replace by fee"" which makes 0-confirmation transactions viable). BCH supporters see storage space as cheap (who cares if the blockchain is 4tb if you can buy an 8tb drive for $150) and feels that networking will continue to evolve to easily handle large blocks in the future, so there isn't a need for almost-mandatory complex offchain solutions in order to use the blockchain.

They are both splits from the same chain in August 2017, and both are different from the original Bitcoin whitepaper, so neither has a claim to the name besides adoption. In general, the most used chain has the name. The most used chain is not Bitcoin Cash by any measure, and trying to argue so makes you look like an idiot. But if at some point in the future BCH overtakes BTC and it doesn't appear to be contested, I don't see why BCH wouldn't be referred to as Bitcoin at that point. (But that would need to happen first)

Basically it boils down to off chain scaling (BTC) versus on chain scaling (BCH).

Calling Bitcoin Cash Bitcoin is roughly as stupid as calling Bitcoin Cash bcash. Just call each what they are.

"You're missing the issue.

There is ""Bitcoin"".  This is the original.  It is commonly abbreviated as BTC.

There are many forks of Bitcoin.  Many of them use ""Bitcoin <xyz>"" in their name.  Examples are ""Bitcoin Cash"" (BCH), ""Bitcoin Diamond"" (BCD) and so on.

Calling Bitcoin (BTC) ""Bitcoin Core"" is wrong.  Bitcoin Core is the name of a client that operates on the Bitcoin network.  One amongst many.

This website even then goes a step further and calls BCH ""Bitcoin"" instead of ""Bitcoin Cash"".  The only effect of this is to confuse people who are not familiar with it and potentially cause them to acquire some BCH instead of BTC when that is what really wanted.

Most people don't complain about the other forks that have Bitcoin in the name because - so far - none of them have companies associated that are actively spreading this level of confusion.  Companies associated with the other forks tend to use the full fork name only and will only ever say ""Bitcoin"" alone when referring to the original BTC chain.

I can't speak for anyone else, but if that website would relocate to something like ""bitcoincash.com"" and consistently refer to BTC as ""Bitcoin"" and BCH as ""Bitcoin Cash"", I wouldn't have any negative feelings towards it.

"It's not just conning, it can be a muddy waters scenario, or just fundamental disagreements.

I was on their side for a considerable amount of time. I was in the bitcoin game early on when it was all ""freedom and decentralization and libertarian festivals and down with the big banks the internet of money is going to help everyone out of poverty! Everyone can be their own bank! Alpaca socks!""

Then I came back to the scene after a few years and the subreddit had changed to 'Bitcoin was never meant to be a peer to peer electronic cash system, [why would you think that](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)? Why would you ever *buy* anything with bitcoin?'

I'm paraphrasing of course, but fees continued to climb. And the community's focus had changed. And even back in 2015 everyone was blindly hyping some apparent vaporware 'lightning network' which, back then, everyone insisted was ""Just around the corner!"" and ""Lightning Network will fix this! It'll fix everything! We promise! I saw a YouTube video on it once!"", when just increasing the damn block size like Satoshi had left as an option seemed like it would immediately result in lowering fees back to economically moot levels like they had been originally.

I'm glad that we're finally starting to see some of the LN, but I'm still apprehensive that the lightning network will actually fix anything. In my career, I'm very used to vendors and sales guys promising the same kind of promises and when we finally get the product, it's a sack of hot garbage. I still hold my BCH that I got from the fork, and continue to buy small amounts regularly alongside my BTC buys. But that's due to inherent economic selfishness and my refusal to blindly support one side over the other, as if cryptocurrency is some kind of competitive sport where only one side wins.

Really it wasn't until I had the realization that a perfect storm of high fees and high volume with a large blocksize might result in, (though doesn't guarantee), a runaway blockchain size problem, in the event that trading volume doesn't go down. If the market becomes crazy bullish and blocks are full and stay full, having large blocks becomes a big problem really fast. And high fee, full block conditions can come out of nowhere. Just see late 2017 for example. I honestly didn't know if that surge was ever going to stop. I was concerned that $20 fees were just 'the new normal' for bitcoin. It was entirely possible.

I still wish BTC would harken back to their roots a little bit and try to solve some layer 1 problems before moving to layer 2 but as aantonop said, if we really need those things, we can always make Bitcoin2 in 10 years or whenever. And transitioning from Bitcoin to Bitcoin2 will be significantly easier than transitioning from Fiat to Bitcoin1. Let's focus on that first.

Money and the Mechanism of Exchange (1875), William Jevons. University College of London, creator of the Marginal Value theory, father of math in Economics. Influenced Irving Fisher and Alfred Marshall. It's literally hard economic theory. Bitcoin isn't money and never will be in the current form. ZWD isn't accepted in most FOREX trading and is failing money, just like the Deutsch Mark after WW1. It's literally losing it's functionality as money, just like the Venezuelan Bs.F. Money only works as money while it is stable and you can used it as store of value. Bitcoin fails that requirement as it's value fluctuates enough for economic calculus to be impossible. Therefore, it isn't money. ;0;0;False;lgb_br;dxwn2kq;This is NOT OK. Upvote for visibility;8ek5c0;https://i.redd.it/w8sjxhnnsut01.png

Fuck core and bcrash. Anyone who truly understands the tech has realized that Bitcoin is great start but only a model or loose guideline. The crypto of the future that will likely become the crypto standard likely doesn't exist yet. Maybe the foundation which may evolve into it may exist but Bitcoin from the ground up is not capable of what a third + generation crypto will be capable of.

I believe this is why Roger Ver and the BCH teams are branding themselves as bitcoin. It's closer to being a payment method for everyday items than BTC is (due to high fees, etc, etc...). I'm not sure why so many people care what they call themselves. Its beyond me why anyone would look at tweets about its name vs. its functionality and use the former as a reason to not adopt BCH. Let them call themselves the US Dollar for all I care. I just want a quick reliable decentralized currency to eventually move over to and away from traditional fiat. That's what BTC started as. That's what BCH is trying to achieve. Do your own research and make up your own mind though. Don't just listen to shitposters and shillers.

BCH is just put a bandage on the scaling issue. Real life payments and transactions should not take time,  it needs to be more liquid than that. Instant and zero as possible fees. That money has to move quickly for some people and businesses. The transaction fees will add up even if they were set to 1/sat per byte.

A confidence trick (synonyms include confidence game, confidence scheme, ripoff, scam and stratagem) is an attempt to defraud a person or group after first gaining their confidence, used in the classical sense of trust. Confidence tricks exploit characteristics of the human psyche, such as credulity, naïveté, compassion, vanity, irresponsibility, and greed.

"Because it fails all 3 functions of money.

1) it is not currently a viable mean of payment. Not everyone accepts it, mostly because;

2) it is not a store of value. Bitcoin is way too volatile to be used as a currency. Imagine if your dollars would lose 40% of their purchasing powe in a week... Only to regain it 2 weeks later. You can become a millionaire and then broke in a few weeks, without changing the numbers in your bank account. And because of that, Bitcoin can't be used as;

3) Unit of account. How can you price something if the value of currency itself changes? You can't price something in Bitcoin because the value of bitcoin itself changes too fast comparatively to everything else. It's a quasi-inflation rollercoaster. When bitcoin loses value, it's inflation, when it gains value, it's deflation. To make long term plans, you need a stable currency, where its value doesn't change. Imagine you own a shop. You want to invest because you think you can make 10% more money if buy whatever. However, there is also the possibility that the money sitting in your pocket will, by itself, value 30% in the same time of your investment. So you don't invest because you're afraid you will lose that potential 30% gain. It becomes impossible to make plans to the future because money won't be usable as an unit to.make the calculations of the investment. 


TL;DR: Bitcoin isn't currency because it's not even money. It can't be money until it's value becomes stable enough that it won't fluctuate more than a normal inflation rate.

"> We aren't stuck with the current state of bitcoin forever.

No. Changes can be made to the core code, and any miners that adopt the change will be supporting the new code. S2X was intended to be such a change but was rejected by the btc community, so the fork never happened. Had it happened, we'd have a different bitcoin today than we did 2 years ago. There's nothing saying it wont be attempted to be changed several times in the future, and any of those potential changes could be mass adopted and we get a different bitcoin on the other side. 

It's all a matter of why is there an attempt at change, and will the new code result in a better bitcoin. If we see obvious shortcomings as more people adopt and we scale up, there might be legitimate need to make changes to the core code for it to develop any further.

If some other crypto figures out ways to do things better than bitcoin, there's really no reason why bitcoin itself couldn't just adopt whatever those differences were, depending on what the specific changes would be.";0;1;False;Some_Dude_;dxwhfsd;This is NOT OK.

More a response to a lot of sentiment in the thread that Roger is evil, and the confusion caused by the ""Bitcoin"" in ""Bitcoin Cash"" is the sole reason for it's popularity.  I don't think so.  There was certainly PR reasons behind the choice of name, but if that was all it had, it would have much less market interest now -- Bitcoin Gold is a good example.  You can find some places that still trade it, but it's value is abysmal.  

> However I think there is a flaw with your statement in general. A small number of people can convince a large number of people about conspiracies and technological solutions that others disagree with, and that can create a base that is strong enough to then support an even much larger portion of people to speculate on the price.

That is a reasonable point.  Bear in mind it might well be applied to both sides of this discussion, though.

> My biggest concern with BCH is what if it wins, and then 10 years from now, on-chain scaling is an ENORMOUS problem, and the block-chain is too large to be run outside datacenters, and then governments shut down datacenters to stop bitcoin.

I don't think the BCH camp is completely averse to off-chain scaling.  Just that at the current time, it is not the appropriate solution.  My concern with BTC and LN is actually similar -- I suspect that the network model that will grow is that you will have most users (both buyers and sellers) connected as leaf nodes to large, well connected hubs, much like TCP traffic is with the current internet.  And those hubs will be vulnerable to both overt and covert attacks.  Centralization of one sort or another is inevitable as adoption goes mainstream.

TBH, I do think that BCH is more likely to come out on top in the long run, but it's by no means certain.  It may well be BTC or some other coin that wins out.  Or the whole concept may end up a failed experiment.  Ask me in a decade.  Or two.  :D";2;0;False;bgrnbrg;dxw8oac;This is NOT OK. Upvote for visibility;8ek5c0;https://i.redd.it/w8sjxhnnsut01.png

"The difficulty makes mining harder and ensures that a new block is mined every 10 minutes on average when hash power increases. BTC has a blocksize of 1MB as opposed to BCH's 8MB, so naturally BCH's blockchain can deal with more transactions in the same time. The problem with a bigger blocksize is that the entire blockchain becomes larger (naturally), so storing and propagating (bandwidth) becomes more expensive. If running a node becomes more expensive, then simple economics tells us, that fewer people run nodes which decreases decentralization. Because decentralization is expensive, maximum decentralization isn't always best though, so you need to find a balance. In my opinion, although raising blocksize to 8MB is not a big deal and still decentral enough, it's still only a temporary solution since blocksize scales linearly while usage if adopted will increase exponentially. Given advancements in infrastructure and cheaper technology, BCH may be able to keep on increasing blocksize until adoption stops increasing.

BTC on the other hand tries to scale by trying to offload most transactions to the Lightning Network. Within this peer-to-peer network money can be transferred instantly and free or for a small fee. The details on how this Lightning Network works are very complex and keep on changing. This, too carries some degree of centralization with it (debatable). There is tons I would add to this paragraph if I wasn't so lazy.

"Cryptocurrencies competing against each other would be perfectly fine. But unfortunately this is way worse, and OP's screenshot is a perfect example of it, it's about a group of people misleading the public for own profit.

As you can see in the outlined area of the screenshot, the site lists 2 currencies, Bitcoin (BCH) and Bitcoin Core (BTC). As a matter of a fact, there is no such coin as ""Bitcoin Core"".

BTC or ""Bitcoin"" as we all know since 2009, is a protocol or an economic unit where ""Bitcoin Core"" is one out of many wallet implementations.

BCH is known as ""Bitcoin Cash"" or ""Bcash"". Though the site on the screenshot is listing it as just ""Bitcoin"" in an attempt to forcefully take the brand and mislead people into thinking it's the coin that's being spoken of on the news or in friend-to-friend conversations.

Lots of news media have spoken about Bitcoin being over $10000 a while ago, but BCH has never achieved such a thing at the time of writing this, however if this kind of lies keep spreading people will begin thinking so.

Far from the page being shown in the screenshot, associated people and companies have been spreading tons of misleading info all over the media like for example [this](https://twitter.com/rogerkver/status/853250894162350080) which is provably false by anyone with enough understanding of the protocol.

"\-folks will vote with their dollars, and if we're confident in BTC over BCH, this will sort itself out. Outside of the mindless $20 investor\-types, they will realize there's a discrepancy when they see a Bitcoin \(btc\) and Bitcoin \(BCH\), naturally dig into it, and stumble on this stuff, and then decide for themselves. 

\-A very deliberate effort is obviously being made, but if one has to constantly argue that 'their vision/change is the right one, no it's not what you actually think, *change narrative etc. etc.,'* then it starts to reek of something or someone desperately needing to prove they're right. Facts always win out. If BTC is 'right,' in that it has the right tech, right set up, right protocol, then long term that'll reflect on hash power, etc. Let Ver do this nonsense 

\-The new securities law discussions popping up lend an interesting angle to it. SEC and co. are definitely trying to slap some framework on this. If you don't believe the two previous 'market will win out' approaches, then try legal i suppose. Good case #1: get SEC to take Ver to court for misleading investors, file a criminal complaint, let BCH experience the downside of having a currency with a visible leader.

It means brands are not protected and any jackass can fork your coin and claim he is following the original vision and the others aren't and if enough jackasses follow him then the network decides that this ""brand"" has value. 

There is no such thing as real bitcoin. The people decide individually. In case of bcash it has less value than bitcoin (core) but it is much more than zero so some people are fine with that vision which means to them bitcoin cash isn't a worthless knockoff but simply another version (in their eyes, more close to the idea of white paper and therefore more valid).

Don't get me wrong, Roger Ver is batshit crazy but if he believes bitcoin cash is real bitcoin and it is worth more than 0 and some people agree then they are technically not wrong. People who say btc is real bitcoin are also not wrong. This is what permissionlessness is. Anyone can claim whatever they want, in the end the market decides and this decision can be decisive (like the other previous bitocoin scammy forks that nobody cares about which gone nowhere) or indecisive like the BCH vs BTC case.

"I understand your point of view but let's be clear here, there's no such thing as an existing definition of the real bitcoin.

To crazy Roger and his fans his fork with bigger blocks with bigger capacity is a real bitcoin, closer to a white paper vision a peer to peer cash.

To many people here bitcoin btc is a real bitcoin, with smaller blocks potentially less susceptible to centralization. Fundamentally they're both correct because there is no absolute definition, it's all about perspective and what in your opinion is the direction the network should develop. Now of course more people believe in BTC than in BCH but what if today someone made a fork and the network would split 50/50? Which one would be the real bitcoin? Who gets to decide that and why? What if the split would go in 3 distinctive ways because of some community split or development arguments and all of the new networks would get approximately 1/3 of the market share? Would Chain A, B or C be a real bitcoin and why? Or maybe the previous BCH? 

That would depend entirely on the people who chose one network over the other. This is why unlike people who are very attached to their favorite crypto brand in my opinion this is fine. Why? People who put their trust in BCH may truly believe that saving people from putting money in fake bitcoin (btc) is a good thing to do because BCH is better and more useful. Meanwhile BTC fans will believe that protecting people from fake bitcoin (bch) pretending to be ""real"" bitcoin is the right thing to do because BTC is better. I know that many people will argue here that the scummy moves and misleading practices of Roger are bad and he is on the wrong side of history but once again, pretend for a minute that you believe that BCH vision is much better, in such case fighting the ""core"" with anything you've got would be the right thing to do.

People who are emotionally or financially invested in one of those will often defend their beliefs to the death and deny the other group their position. I on the other hand believe there is no fundamental absolute truth which chain is the truest one and both groups have the right to claim they are correct and the degree of their success should be determined by the consensus of people not some powerful organisation that will impede them one way or another just because some people complained about them. By asking some authority to intervene they are taking the ability of the people to decide and that is not decentralization. 

Like that twitter shutdown. People were cheering that the Twitter has shut down bitcoin account (which is presumably controlled by BCH people) and this was wrong in my opinion. When a centralized entity takes power from your opponent it may be convenient but it is a hypocrisy to cheer because when the same thing would happen to you you'd be crying about your ruined decentralization dreams.

"They are labeling bch as Bitcoin and btc as Bitcoin Core. 

I just don’t see how that seems like a good move aside from the fact that the number of people who are confused and buying something other than what they intended and complain about it, vs the number of people who are confused and buy something other than what they intended and don’t complain is an acceptable ratio to Ver, because it will keep the trend of ‘adoption’ climbing and he can get more out of bch before he bails than if he didn’t do stuff like this.

The worst part is that BCH has its own value and can rise and increase adoption on its own merits without this shady crap.  Ver is very much not ignoring the fact that people see ‘Bitcoin’ on the news at nearly $10,000, and all their friend talking about it over the years, and then go to bitcoin.com and see Bitcoin selling for a fraction of that, and thinking they’ll get a steal.  It erodes confidence in people who are tricked, makes BCH seem like it’s not great on its own merits, and all around crappy.

The difference is, that the currency is ""aimed"" at different people while BCH and BTC compete for the same market. BTC has been established as (the) Bitcoin. Forking off of the main project and claiming the same name just seems purposefully misleading. Why would someone fork off and not try to distance itself to the coin that it forked off from?

Let's say the price is $400. The chaos surrounding the gox collapse caused the price to drop so quickly and sporadically that we saw $400 become $200 but since the bots and trade engine were not prepared or aware of the situation ( since not super AI ) the price spiked back up to $400. Some quick acting individuals placed buys and sells near the ceiling and floor and doubled their money on a magnitude of several orders. In that 5 mins it was possible to make 100% profit more than once. In fact the swings were so rapid it were as if someone was blinking and the price moved 80% - 100%+ with every blink.;5;1;False;RallyUp;dxw1t8n;It’s over 9000!!!!!!;8egh4c;https://i.redd.it/981nlnpg7rt01.jpg

"You do you pal. If you want to be a crypto hero, buy the dip and HODL. I'm not here to save the world. I think most people are in this to make money. I don't at the moment make more than enough money and I don't trade with a bot. I trade a couple of grand that I made with a couple of hundred I put on not too long ago.

I have no issue with shorting at the top of every spike and scalping when things are going sideways. Maybe when I'm at the point that I can pay off my regular debts and make more than enough as a job, I can be less aggressive about this, but I don't feel I have a reason to feel bad about making 15% of my holdings a day by trading like a dick.";1;1;False;Voidward;dxvwjyc;It’s over 9000!!!!!!;8egh4c;https://i.redd.it/981nlnpg7rt01.jpg
"Yeah, I do fiat to BTC. Alts tend to follow BTC too often, and then you're relying on 2 unstable variables rather than one. Going BTC -> ETH doesn't do anything for you when the whole market is crashing. If you do trades to fiat, you can make money the whole way down any time there's a spike/trap/panic sell. If you're trading between 2 cryptos while everything's in flames, you're still in the dumpster at the end of the day.

I put in money at 8800, and by the time BTC slipped down to 6800, I doubled the fiat I put in. Maybe that's doable with BTC to alts, I just haven't had as much luck. I find this much more intuitive and controllable.";3;0;False;Voidward;dxvkgz7;It’s over 9000!!!!!!;8egh4c;https://i.redd.it/981nlnpg7rt01.jpg

"You're a bot trader, making more money than you need, preaching to someone who's been doing this for a month about how virtuous they are to DCA out at the bottom of crashes and being slightly inefficient. How generous of you. Good to know you're not a twat like me.

Even the HODLers are here to make money. They're not talking about lambos to save the world, they just suck at trading and their reasons  for not doing it is ""you'll crash your portfolio in a month"" and ""99% of traders fail, don't do it ""

Now the bot trader is telling me I'm a bad guy for spending 10 hours trading to make a few hundred. Yeah alright pal, I can feel the virtue seeping off of you. Maybe one day I'll be saintly enough to not give a shit how sloppily I exit the market with my bounty of profits and then I'll be a good guy too.";1;1;False;Voidward;dxvxzw8;It’s over 9000!!!!!!;8egh4c;https://i.redd.it/981nlnpg7rt01.jpg

Like, for instance, the episode in Star Trek TNG where Picard throws his hands up and says, ""Why?"" was early 90's, but we don't say the meme started in the early nineties because it didn't come along into the internet pantheon until at least a decade later, right?  Anyways, I don't think it's correct to say this DBZ meme was born in 1997.  That's just when the source material first went public.

I've been HODLing for 6 months now. Buying the dips but never selling the rises. Always been too greedy. So now I am going to see 20% of my coins. This way if they go up, that's ok - I still have 90% of my coins - but if there another bloodbath, I don't go into 3 days of depression, kicking myself that I didn't see this coming.

"Why is everyone selling at exactly 10,000 ?

Makes no sense.

1. If you sold at 9999.99 you're more likely to succeed.

2. Makes it harder for bitcoin to reach 10,000.

Sellers gotta smarten up.

Or maybe they want the price to go back below 10,000 right after they sell?

Well, if you sell some at 10,000 and hoping to sell some higher, sell the first at either 9999 or 10001.";2;0;False;;dxvhh56;It’s over 9000!!!!!!;8egh4c;https://i.redd.it/981nlnpg7rt01.jpg

">How is a fiat coin/note any easier to divide or count than a gold/silver coin?

Gold is worth too much to make small change coins that are practical. A fiat coin or note with a chunk missing is still worth the same, a gold coin with a chunk missing definitely isn't.

>a dollar bill has a far lower value to weight ratio than gold does

I think you switched those by accident

>it doesn't stop dollars being used as currency because of the weight of carrying a wad of notes.

Oh, you're serious... No, notes are lighter per dollar value than gold.

>Only $50 and higher notes have a higher value to weight ratio and they're rarely used because they're so large.

Except in the case where the weight of the notes would be a problem. If someone is carrying $1 bills, they aren't worried about the weight.

>modern coinmaking techniques make coin shaving economically unfeasible. they're designed so that taking any meaningful amount of material off the coin will both cost more than it makes and destroy the security features of the coin which means there's no reason to do it.

I'm not familiar, is this still true for gold coins or does it assume that the coin is made of cheaper materials? Can you share a link?

>coinshaving was only common when coins used simple soft alloys and had designs simple enough to shave without destroying more value than would be gained

But if you shave a small portion and the recepient doesn't notice, no value is lost to you because the coin will be accepted at face value.

"> Having money that doesn't slowly rot seems like a decent one for starters, then you also get border-less currency thrown in for free.

Cigarettes slowly rot, yet cigarettes are much better currency in prison than gold.

Almost like appreciation isn't actually necessary or sufficient for a currency to have.

">Gold is worth too much to make small change coins that are practical

No coins have ever been made of pure gold, they're all alloys because gold is too soft in pure form to make a durable coin. Some of the earliest gold coins were only 40% gold.

you could make a 10 cent gold coin the size of a pizza if you wanted to, you just alloy it with less valuable metal.

Alloying coins is good for multiple reasons, it increases hardness which makes them more durable and harder to shave, and it also destroys the financial incentive to clip or shave them since it greatly increases the processing cost to retrieve pure gold from the coin.

You can also just trade redeemable gold tokens like the central bank used to and like modern metal exchanges still do. Or you could just use cheaper metals like silver or steel.

>Oh, you're serious... No, notes are lighter per dollar value than gold.

Dollar notes weigh 1 gram. Google the price of a gram of gold.

As I said, the only notes that are worth more than their weight in gold are the 50 and the 100. No one complains about the weight of a $20 bill. ""gold is too heavy"" is just knee jerk defense from deflationists who haven't really thought about why gold isn't used as currency. 

it also contradicts the other argument that ""gold is too valuable for small coins"". It can't both have too high a value to weight ratio and too low.

> A fiat coin or note with a chunk missing is still worth the same, a gold coin with a chunk missing definitely isn't.

When have you ever used a fiat coin or note with a ""chunk"" missing? These don't circulate because no one is going to accept a $20 with a piece missing. At best you could get away with is a small tear and at that point the note is at the very end of its life and about to lose all its value. 

>I'm not familiar, is this still true for gold coins or does it assume that the coin is made of cheaper materials? Can you share a link?

Google ""coin security features"", that's all I would do for you. Modern coins can be made very hard with very intricate designs that are impossible to shave without destroying. As soon as you destroy a security feature you immediately downgrade the coin value since its not harder to tell if its forged, which is especially important for commodity coins where the coin isn't just a token but a physical commodity.";1;1;False;suninabox;dxwk8hk;"Bitcoin exposes the massive economic illiteracy of financial journalism; arm yourselves with knowledge.";7iyej5;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7iyej5/bitcoin_exposes_the_massive_economic_illiteracy/
">Except for the facts that they're heavy and hard to divide and count on the spot?

How is a fiat coin/note any easier to divide or count than a gold/silver coin?

a dollar bill has a far lower value to weight ratio than gold does, it doesn't stop dollars being used as currency because of the weight of carrying a wad of notes. Only $50 and higher notes have a higher value to weight ratio and they're rarely used because they're so large.

>there's plenty of history that shows that people start cutting little pieces from the coins and other types of shenanigans

modern coinmaking techniques make coin shaving economically unfeasible. they're designed so that taking any meaningful amount of material off the coin will both cost more than it makes and destroy the security features of the coin which means there's no reason to do it.

"Credibility is important to science. It's why we trust some journals, but not others. It's why you must list funding sources. It's why your career is instantly destroyed the moment you get caught presenting fake data. Science tries to be as objective as possible, but the core message in modern philosophy of science discussions is that it is impossible to divorce science from the failings of the human mind. The way to separate the good from the bad is to demand evidence generated under compelling methods. Evidence I have asked for from you. Instead all I see is ideology steeped in moral superiority. An ideology I happen to agree with; a fact that I don't think you've noticed. I am not on this sub to troll. I'm here because I'm an actual adopter of bitcoin - and not just as a get-rich-quick investment. So I am not debating the ideology behind it. I am debating whether it has been successfully applied and stress-tested in an rather unrelated realm. A discussion forum is *very* different beast than a financial ledger.

I practice experimental science as a career. Ideologies and hypotheses and guesses masquerading as ""theories"" are a dime-a-dozen. People are good at generating ideas that seem plausible. These can be comfortable or convenient to believe. But they are not so different from faith until tested. When you are attempting to promote an ideological shift, the burden is on you to convince people.

Your inclination to declare my skepticism as unscientific is absurd. Skepticism is the foundation on which science rests. Were it not for that, charlatans and snake-oil salesmen would take over. I cannot accept the blind application of any ideology, no matter how seemingly great, without careful consideration. Just because a distributed consensus system works well for a financial ledger doesn't mean we can claim it is possible to apply the technology to every facet of life. We can certainly try, though (and should). But I am unconvinced a decentralized community can prevent decay by popularity. This is not the same as being convinced of the opposite. I'm open minded, but you've not presented a single shred of evidence to convince me.";1;1;False;CaptainOuzo;dxwgq1c;Amazon filed a patent to de-anonymize Bitcoin transactions and sell the data to law enforcement;8dc65s;http://darkcitycrypto.com/index.php/2018/04/19/amazon-filed-a-patent-to-de-anonymize-bitcoin-transactions-and-sell-the-data-to-law-enforcement/

"> Credibility is important to science.

Not real science.  That's called either religion or politics when you're letting someone else tell you what to believe.

Those of us doing real science take all the data, ALL OF IT, and combine it together to make a theory of our own, and then test it out.  We don't care who is offering the data.
