I know that's not what you meant, but seriously though, supply and demand is important, but my point was more so that things should be priced fairly and accordingly; I feel this should apply more to drugs more than a lot of things even, say televisions, especially psychedelics and empathogens.

Once a felon, you lose the right to vote, own guns, and it becomes damn near impossible to get a job.

"> Pills have been pressed with all kinds of logos for years now. I remember a decade ago at least, that blue Mitzibushi's were the ones to get. There's since been pressings with logos from McDonalds, Playboy, Sky, 007, Motorola, Adidas, Volkswagen & Armani, to name but a few. If Bitcoin has now been included within this sub-culture I struggle to see how this is bad! Are any of the brands I just listed damaged specifically for having a pill pressed with their logo? I don't think so....

My SO asked me how many dogecoins I have, and I said ""4-ish"". He asked if that was a lot and I giggled and just said that his friend that mentioned having 300,000 of them had about $200 usd worth. 

Takes a whole lotta dogecoin to make a usd, but damn if it isn't a fun community :) 

Edit: also, /r/dogeducation for anyone wanting to get into cryptocurrancy, I'd recommend starting with dogecoin because the community has been very welcoming, supportive, and they ELI5 without making me feel inferior or overwhelmed by everything.

"Pills like these are normally around 200mg. The pills themselves are normally around 10 dollars. At $565 a bitcoin, you could probably get about 65-70 of these pills (you always get discounted for buying in bulk, especially in the drug trade.) If you took 65-70 200mg pills, that'd be 13-14 grams of MDMA.

I publicly condone the use of drugs and I publicly support the use of darknet markets. Why? Because people will do them regardless and if they do, we shouldn't ostracize them because that will make them feel like worthless outcasts leading to a more destructive lifestyle. I support darknet markets because it's a safe and easy way to buy your drugs and be sure that whoever you're buying from is legitimate and sells quality product.;0;1;False;;cg9qygq;I heard some guy in the restroom of a club talking about bitcoins.

>The primary acute risks of taking MDMA resemble those of other stimulant amphetamines. The second most important cause of death from MDMA use is hyperthermia, core body temperature rising too high until the major organs shut down at about 42°C. This is comparatively more problematic than blood salt imbalance, harder to treat and to avoid. MDMA-related hyperthermia may occur as a symptom of [serotonin syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome), which is where too much serotonin is released into the brain. This can occur with MDMA if too much [5HTP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-Hydroxytryptophan) or other serotonergic drugs are consumed together. 50–200 mg of 5HTP is believed by some users to make MDMA work better and last longer, but anecdotally more than 300 mg 5HTP may increase risk of serotonin syndrome [*[citation needed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*], which can lead into lethal hyperthermia if it becomes too severe. It has been suggested that [hyperthyroidism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperthyroidism) may also increase risk of MDMA-related hyperthermia.
