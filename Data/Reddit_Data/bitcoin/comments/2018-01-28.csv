"It depends a lot on your age and your appetite for risk, but if you retire young and still expect to live for decades and decades it would make sense to keep a lot of it in equities at the return is greater with equities and *over long periods* drops in the market average out.

The main reason for moving into something ""less risky"" close to retirement is that if you retire at 65 you probably aren't going to live another 40 years and a relatively short-term crash could be devastating for you, and you won't have the years of life left to wait for it to build back up. So you move into more secure investments.

No-one investing long-term for their retirement just stashes cash in the bank. You wouldn't do that.

I mean Bitcoin is incredibly volatile and incredibly risky by comparison to an index. An index isn't totally risk-free, nothing that generates significant returns is, but it has the 100-year record of providing these consistent returns if held over the long-term. If you invested in Bitcoin at the mid-December peak you lose, lose lose as well, and a lot more than even cash. Long term we really don't know what is going to happen with it.

But you could trivially retire with $2m. I think people that think you can't just have no connection whatsoever with reality. The average individual income in the US is around $30,000. Median net worth at retirement is $200,000 *per household*. $2m is **ten times that**. And that $2k figure is by household, which typically is at least 2 people.

"You know if you start pulling these appeal to authority ""ive been here longer than you so I know more"" arguments... you have already lost.  

If you really think you have an argument against the poor using bitcoin based on the limited exposure they had and the resulting limited acceptance, you are insane.  For bitcoin to work in a poor low tech country, the populous needs many many years of constant access to extremely low fee transfers and a fairly robust infrastructure system developed around their limited technology.  Since this was even close to a reality before the fees became insane, you can't even begin to say that it didn't work because of other reasons.  

If lightning works without losing a bunch of people money, then maybe bitcoin can start to pull actual use cases back, but I am pretty sure that like every other piece of software in the world, there will be bugs discovered that might loose some people a lot of money while it is growing up.  By the time lightening gets its kinks worked out, it will likely be too late.

"As someone who's been around forever, I think that might be overstating it a bit, because the buy-sell spreads were always particularly steep. Especially in countries where Localbitcoins was the only option, or some small local trader/shop. 

Like you could buy and sell BTC with a decentish spread if you were in the US or some parts of Europe. But that last mile converting it back to local currency in other countries made it not quite the slam dunk option that many people seemed to always believe that it was(or would become eventually).

If the fees were a non-issue then it might actually be better now than it was. I'm not sure how much better the spreads are now in 2018. I know there are all kinds of new exchanges and such, so it might be a much better situation now. If they are actually far better than they were, and super low fees via LN become a reality, then perhaps the rose-coloured past might become the real present though. 

If we're talking domestic transfers, they are almost always super low cost or free in every 'developing' or 'newly developed' country from what I've seen. Interested to know if there are any countries other than the US where the domestic transfer system is expensive, slow, and shitty if anyone happens to have some examples.

"An international conspiracy of rappers planned 9/11. How, you ask? Think about this: 2pac 2 Chainz 2 Towers. Is it a coincidence? Can't be. One might ask though -- 2pac? Why would he want to destroy the twin towers? The answer is simple. One only needs to look at the East Coast / West Coast hip hop feud. Who was 2pac's biggest rival? That's right, the Notorious B.I.G. aka Biggie Smalls aka Christopher Wallace. Where did Mr. Wallace live? Oh, right New York City: the same place the Twin Towers are. Tupac wanted to desecrate Biggie's grave. ""But Elijah"" you might say, ""didn't Tupac Shakur die in 1996?"" Of course not! Tupac, after faking his death and hiding in Cuba, started reaching out to his network of relatives and friends. The Shakur family had connexions to the Muslim Brotherhood and many criminal organizations -- in fact, 2pac still has relatives on the FBI Most Wanted list.

So, Tupac had the motivation and the means, but what about 2 Chainz? Why would he want to destroy the twin towers? The answer lies in one of Chainz' most popular songs -- ""Birthday Song"" featuring Kanye West. Whose birthday is on September 11? Not just co-conspirators Elephant Man and Ludacris (who has collaborated with Kanye many times), but also Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. That's right, 2 Chainz, in order to give a birthday gift to and ingratiate himself with Assad, destroyed the World Trade Center towers.

Where, though, does Kanye, the other musician on Birthday Song come in? Well, let's look at Mr. West's family. Yeezy is married to Keeping Up With the Kardashians star and notorious sex tape actress Kim Kardashian. And who, you might wonder, is the fruit of this union? Yeezus' daughter North West. (!) Wait a sceond... North West? Where are the twin towers in relation to Syria? NORTHWEST!!! Kanye is in on it!

I wish I could say that the conspiracy stops there, but by golly it doesn't. Who was President when 9/11 happened? George Walker Bush. What was the name of Snoop Dogg's most recent studio album? BUSH! Snoop Dogg was in on it too.

But let's think: who signed Snoop Dogg to his record label? Right, legendary rapper/producer Dr. Dre. Wait a minute! What year did the towers fall? 2001. What is a Dre album name? 2001!!! Coincidence? I think not!

But hold on, Snoop Doggy Dogg isn't the only rapper signed to Dre. Who else did he recruit? Grammy-winning rapper Eminem. AKA Marshall Mathers. What movie did Eminem become famous from? 8 Mile. How many syllables in ""mile""? 1. 8+1=9! Plus what happens when you add the 2 Ms from ""Marshall Mathers""? 11! 9/11!!!!!! Moreover, what other name does Mathers go by? Slim Shady! SS!

Where else do we know those initials from? Oh, right, the elite Nazi unit of Hitler's. What was the name of Hitler's regime? The Third Reich! Third... Three... Three side of a triangle...

Δ ILLUMINATI CONFIRMED Δ

Illuminati is Latin for ""the enlightened ones"". Who spoke Latin? The Ancient Romans. Let's think about them: Who is a famous Roman? Julius Caesar. One of his most famous works, Commentaries on the Gallic War, opens with the line ""All Gaul is divided into THREE parts."" Again, the Illuminati number shows up.

""Hold on for a minute there, Elijah,"" you might say, ""sure, you may have proved the Ancient Romans were in the Illuminati, but what does all this have to do with 9/11?"" Well, the Romans derived much of their mythology from the Greeks. Who were a famous mythological group who inspired art in mythology? Right, the Muses, of whom there were 9. Plus, when you add the two consuls at the head of the Roman civil government, you get 11. Again! 9/11 (or, as the Romans might put it, IX/XI).

Another famous Roman was the orator Marcus Tullius Cicero. One technique he would use in his speech was the tricolon crescens. TRIcolon? Three pops up again in Ancient Rome! Not to mention ""crescens"" --> ""crescent"". Who has a crescent and star as their symbol? Islam!

Wait... Islam... Hitler... what do they have in common? Persecution of the Jews. Is it possible that the Jews knew about this conspiracy this whole time? Perhaps these co-conspirators persecuted the Jews so the secret wouldn't get out.

Now, let's blow the lid off the biggest secret of them all. 9/11 was a firey explosion in America. But what firey explosion happened in Rome? The eruption of Mt. Vesuvius! How many major towns were destroyed by the volcano? Two! Pompeii and Herculaneum. Another parallel to Sept. 11! Now, we all know jet fuel cannot melt steel beams, but here's another inconvenient truth bomb -- molten lava can't melt marble columns!

MT. VESUVIUS WAS AN INSIDE JOB!!!

That is actually a giant misconception. The entire bitcoin network *can* run on just a single laptop, more nodes simply decentralizes the network. More hashing power on a node does (almost) nothing to speed up the network, it just means that node is more likely to proc a reward. If mining was incompatible with ASICs that would make something like GPUs the standard to mine with which some people find to be a better solution since ASIC production is more monopolized.;1;2;False;ThrowingAwayTheLice;dtcuivx;Bitcointalk's famous user Loaded moved his 40k BTC stash to a native SegWit address. $1 in fee to move $400M+.;7tcmi4;https://twitter.com/khannib/status/957186970672947200

Utterly false. The very concept was created in the 1970s; and it is an attack on the money-ness of government currency. It is a reckless destruction of civil liberties that are arguably as important as free speech. There has to be such a thing as a non-revocable payment, and that requires an unencumbered ownership of money, for if there isn't no one can ever actually own money which cripples *serious* business. The question is what you embed that non-revocable layer into. With the current system only realistically, banks and ultimately central banks have access to that layer (even SWIFT is somewhat reversible) electronically, for ordinary people they have access to that via cash; and governments are aggressively trying to remove it (it's already been crippled with size limits). But I believe they will fail, people *will* have access to real cash, at least digitally, maybe even physically too.

> Where blockchain tech comes in is it can either circumvent the regulation, or it can make the cost of this regulation much cheaper. 

Don't listen to all the shitcoiners, ICOs and worst of all the corporate ""private blockchain"" drivel; the very concept of a ""blockchain"" (a ludicrously inefficient design) only exists to enable survival against large-scale state-actor sponsored attack. See: egold, I am being literal.

People try to twist the definition so that it can work in a controlled setting; that's not ""blockchain"", it's basic cryptography applied to distributed databases, tech that's been around 30-40 years and should probably already have been in use at least 10-15 years ago.

> Take your pick. 

That's the fundamental problem, people *can't* take their pick, in the existing framework. Those of us (like me) who have no need for government to tell us what we can invest in, never wanted external control over our money, but never had any choice. Now to a limited extent we do, with Bitcoin, which is why we spend our time on it.

"> Did the people abandon those systems or did the people who benefit from fiat abandon those systems? 

No, the people did. There are plenty of currencies in use around the world that are not government fiat.

It's perfectly legal to use gold coins (or gold certificates) as currency now, and there are hundreds of countries its never been illegal to. 

There are people around the world using everything from cigarettes to phone credit as currency. To my knowledge there are no examples of anyone still using gold as currency for the reasons I've already stated. It's too profitable to hoard so its become an asset, not a currency. Gold is now measured in other currencies rather than being a currency other things are measured in.

>Remember, they had to literally outlaw private gold ownership to institute the dollar system in the US.

They did that because during the Great Depression hyper-deflation was destroying the economy and causing millions of people to become unemployed and malnurished. 

Executive Order 6102 was in 1933, Bretton woods wasn't until 1944, the the gold standard wasn't fully abandoned until 1971. 

If it was some plot to get rid of the gold standard why would they still be pegging the dollar to gold? Why would they care who was hoarding gold? You can hoard as much gold as you want now and the US dollar is completely free floating.

Executive Order 6102 wasn't an attempt to destroy the gold standard it was an attempt to save it. The Fed required gold to print new dollars, and the hoarding of gold made it impossible to print more money even though there was a 35% monetary contraction during the Great Depression. Banning private gold ownership was an attempt to make more gold available as currency.

There are plenty of other countries that never banned private gold ownership that still abandoned gold currency.

>New Bitcoins are added to the system every 10 minutes on average. I'm afraid you don't know what ""hyper-deflationary"" means in addition to not knowing history.

And thousands of tons of gold are mined every year. There are many more tons of gold mined per year than there were 100 years ago. Is gold inflationary? Why do people keep talking about the gold standard like its some kind of antidote to inflation if we keep producing more and more gold?

I'm talking about relative inflation and deflation. The supply of a currency can increase but if the demand increases even more, you will have relative deflation. The purchasing power of bitcoin went up 1000% last year, that's well in the realms of hyper-deflation, and its because demand rate is going up while supply rate is going down.

USD is deflationary in Zimbabwe but inflationary in the US, because supply of USD in Zimbabwe can't keep up with demand because they don't print their own and have to rely on arbitragers to bring in more currency.

">Why is the network less congested now?

It's difficult to tell with any accuracy, but the most likely reasons are:

* 'spam attacks' stopping (malicious parties creating lots of transactions to deliberately cause congestion and raise fees) - there is no direct evidence of this that I'm aware of
* Increase in transaction batching (this would explain why there are fewer transactions, but larger transaction size on average)
* increase in segwit usage (not likely a big factor)
* decreased usage overall (number of transactions hasn't lowered enough for this to be a big factor)
* increase in mining has power (more blocks being mined faster than usual, leading to more transactions being processed) - definitely was a factor

I agree with you in principle, but my background in computer science leads me to point out the fact that the amount of processing power devoted to the Bitcoin network is important. The reason is because of the processing power sitting on the sidelines. If ASICs had never been developed, an entity with enough computing power (like the NSA) would be able to disrupt (read: rewrite the blockchain) the network at its whim. As it stands, the Bitcoin network has more computing power than all of the supercomputers in the world combined. This is an important security feature. I agree that SHA-256 is not the best algorithm to solve this problem, and ASIC-resistance is a desirable feature.;1;1;False;ex_nihilo;dtdkdxy;Bitcointalk's famous user Loaded moved his 40k BTC stash to a native SegWit address. $1 in fee to move $400M+.;7tcmi4;https://twitter.com/khannib/status/957186970672947200

"I had the exact same issue happened to me.  But it only took 3 days to resolve.

I wired money from my bank account to Coinbase and incorrectly typed the ""reference code"" that's associated with my Coinbase account.  Note that I have successfully sent many wires to Coinbase without issue - you just have to follow the exact instructions.

I called my bank and requested the tracer number associated with the transfer.  I then called Metropolitan Bank, who Coinbase/Gdax uses, and provided them the tracer.

"You think bitcoin will nearly triple its high from last year when hype hit a fever pitch and everyone + their mother was tagging on? Unlikely. At 10-12k the potential ROI is too small to justify investing a whole lot because 
It could easily go lower. It just takes 1-2 whales to decide its hit a ceiling and sell a big stake to really start off a wave of panic sells.

The regulation speak @ Davos world economic forum doesn’t bode well either.

Unless you already have a shitload of bitcoin investing now is a pretty bad call. Even if it shot back up to its high of 20k you’d only double your money. Maybe you put in 1000 or even 5000.

Only those who have shown their faith by holding our bitcoins. The holy white paper is the purest truth. Those that fathom the perfection of the blockchain see that this is self-evident. Our unenlighted brothers dream of Lambos and banging hot dudes and chicks. They see only bitcoin as compared to fallen and unclean USDT with it peg to evil USD.

"Hi! Thank you sooo much for the detailed feedback!! 

1. The second tab on the app is wishlist where you can add your favorite cryptos. The main interface (tab #1) takes 2.5 seconds to load every time user opens the app. But wishlist takes 0.1-0.3 seconds to load all the cryptos. 

I’m setting up a caching server with a friend and will rewrite all the networking code to be able to display prices faster! Now that you’ve bought the app, you’ll get all updates for free :) 


2. Alright! As you say! Coming in v1.1 for you! :D


3. I can’t fix the center wheel because my tableview’s cells’ length is custom and the wheel is in iOS and it’s in the horizontal middle of the screen. If I make my cells the same (crypto name and price), some cryptocurrencies like bitcoin when converted to a fiat like INR won’t fit in. I’ll research on how I can make my custom Center wheel. 


4. Will fix everything! 

5. 1. Alright, will do. 

5.2 I’m not sure if I understand. Logically the condition you set is being met. You mentioned <12,000$ for BTC. So if the price is below that, it’ll send a notification. However, the cooldown period is 6 hours. So you won’t receive another notification for that alert (I did this because otherwise it can be annoying). 
If you’re interested in getting a notification when the price drops below 11,500$, then you should set 11,500$ in the text box. 


Did I address each of the points in your feedback?

"Alright amiga, I bought your app, it’s really great and I will definitely use it in a future if you will improve a couple of things.

1. Make it faster! So, I was using a CoinDesk app before and it was doing its job about telling me btc price. I come in, it’s right there. Instantly. You need to do the same or you’ll lose to free apps. Here is a short video for a better understanding https://youtu.be/keQ71voDTN8
As you can see, coindesk does it fast and it has one home screen for only one currency. I understand why it takes so much time for your app to load - lots of cryptos to show. So maybe you make a home screen with only one currency. Or like in a Weather iOS app. You choose 2 cities and it shows a weather in a first one on your home screen, you swipe and there is a second city with a forecast. So, something like this. I am not interested in anything except 2 cryptos, I don’t wanna see 100 of others. In my opinion it’s a good idea to keep this screen with 10s of other cryptos but do not make it a home screen. Well, you got my point.

2. Widget. I always use widgets. For the weather, for the currency rates, for the traffic, news, everything. And I wish some btc app would have a nice widget. Most of widgets are ugly, if they have one (usually not). So it’s going to be your good and big advantage if you make one.

3. CENTRALIZE THE GOD DAMN LOADING WHEEL-THING-WHATEVERITIS. My inner rage is growing freaking fast when I see this biased to the right loading wheel🤬😤.
It’s a not a deal-breaker but... just a wish

4. Graphs. To many bugs there. 
Watch this: https://youtu.be/9VYn66slMTk
You can move along the graph. That’s good. But once you’ve done it, you cannot move a pin. You can only move the graph. Just make it so: wanna move a pin - 1 finger, wanna move a graph - 2 fingers. 
Another bug is scaling. I guess it’s a feature to tap twice and a graph will scale but it’s bugged. I tap twice it’s scaling down where it’s only black and white and no graph. I have to swipe it back up. 
Make the pin smaller. It’s too big and wide for such a small graph.

5. Add an option of change theme. Maybe to black/white or smth else. I think not everyone will like black/gold.

6. Thresholds alerts. If current price is $11,500 for example. I set the alert BTC<$12,000. It starts sending me notifications like “THRESHOLD CROSSED 11732.7” and then the same but $1 up. Is it supposed to be working this way?
Oh, and change the format of digits showing. E.g. from 11732.7 to $11,732.7. Looks more... legit, idk

I think that’s all I’ve noticed so far. 
I will rate your app 5 stars and I hope you will change those things. Cause right now you are honestly losing to some free apps. But if you will improve those things your app will worth its price. So I trust you won’t give it up.

And personally, I am glad to see you doing such a great things in your age. You have a great future ;)
