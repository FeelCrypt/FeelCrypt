This doesn't make sense. If you don't have money, you're not going invest in either an inflationary economy or a deflationary economy... So it's not a benefit of one over the other. Being poor in both scenarios suck.

I don't see what that has to do with talking about the dangers of deflation, but I'd also say that economies are complex. Predicting the direction of an economy is taking into account more than one factor. For instance, your economy can be deflating, but productivity increasing, leading to growth. However, the very existence of this meme demonstrates the hoarding behavior experienced with deflation. Just as people rush out to buy things while they can in the case of inflation, people hoard money to get an even better deal in the future. If my money is increasing in value by 10% every year, I might as well wait to buy a car until I absolutely need to because every year I wait, it will be 10% cheaper. This sounds great, but when everyone acts this way, the economy slows down. Japan's situation isn't just about deflation, it's also about population growth driven by a strict immigration policy. But hey, that's their choice to grow their economy at half our rate. Money isn't everything.;2;1;False;linklitter;dmq5f8q;The difference between inflation and deflation...;6yn8hs;https://i.redd.it/zs4byvahrgkz.jpg

"Indexed or adjustable-rate loans do not adjust the principal - they adjust the interest rate. The principal is going to keep increasing in real value throughout the loan's term in a deflationary system.

Hence, in a deflationary system, *the real cost of a loan is going to be higher* - the loan would be paid back with money that is worth more than it is now. The only way to make a deflationary loan equal in cost to an inflationary loan would be if the bank offered a negative interest rate, which will obviously never happen.

Banks offer indexed loans because they benefit the lenders in our inflationary system. They wouldn't offer terms in a deflationary system unless it similarly benefits them.

Furthermore, one glance at a balance sheet would show another reason loans would be unattractive in a deflationary system - liabilities (loans) would keep increasing in real value while assets would not only depreciate as usual but also become worth less in the future than when it was bought due to falling prices.

This is a pretty basic explanation, yes. Although it needs to be expanded upon since it lacks the demand side. Inflation can be defined as the ratio between supply and demand for the currency.

"People with cash are able to remain agnostic as to what they want to buy until the very last moment. They are more prepared for unexpected expenses and opportunities, and therefore free from the need to plan. A person with savings can treat as ordinary expenses things that would be disasters for people who didn’t have savings. Most people, if they have a big enough income, would choose to buy insurance for their car, home, or health. But someone with a lot of savings doesn’t need as much help from other people.

He is also more in a position to help other people who have been struck with disaster. Not only is he in a position to be nice if people should need help, but he is also in a position to profit from doing so. A business has certain expenses that it must make regularly or go out of business. It must make payroll, for example. There is always some risk that the company will not have enough revenue for some time. The company could reduce this risk by holding extra cash, or it could use the cash to buy more capital and attempt to expand its future production. It is difficult to maintain the right balance because circumstances are constantly changing and uncertain, so even fundamentally sound businesses sometimes end up in an immediate need for cash. When that happens the business’s stock price goes down because their risk of insolvency goes up. They may also be willing to take out a loan at a very favorable rate for the lender. An investor with cash on hand can help an otherwise worthwhile business survive by taking care of their immediate expenses and in return can buy the stock at a good value or earn a good rate of interest off a bond.

However, this kind of opportunity does not last forever. Investors who have cash get first dibs on it. When one is in cash, one is uncommitted and ready for opportunity. By contrast, a lot of the potential value of an investment depends on being able to choose when to sell it. A given investment can always go down for a while, even if the investor ultimately is able to sell it at a profit. An investment has a much better chance of being valuable if the investor can expect to hold it long enough that a good selling opportunity will have occurred. Furthermore, although on ordinary days it may seem as if a stock will be easy to sell at any time, there are days when most investments other than cash drop at the same time. During these days it may not be possible to sell investments fast enough and it is much better to have cash on hand in the first place.

Thus, a cash-holder benefits himself by being prepared to take advantage of the best deals, and provides the corresponding benefit to the economy of being prepared to jump in where help is needed. The cash-holders benefit the economy by deciding which troubled businesses can be redeemed and then providing the necessary cash.

Of course, it is not the cash itself that fixes the troubled business. The cash is used to buy the necessary resources to do so. For example, it could be used to pay employees to keep them working until some new revenue comes in. Thus, the existence of cash-holders in an economy can be thought of as meaning that some fraction of the economy’s production is reserved to be diverted to error correction.

A cash-holder can live idly and can avoid making investments. It would be a mistake to look at this person and say that he is not contributing anything. The ability to live idly is also an ability to become committed at any time, to whatever has the greatest need. People depend on this service because it is impossible to avoid error, and insofar as everyone in the economy depends on everyone else, we are all subject to one another's’ errors.

A person who is uncommitted cannot step in to fix every problem that might arise. Eventually he will be committed himself and can take on no additional projects. Therefore, if there is a lot of money held in cash, then there is a lot of tolerance for error in the economy, whereas if there is little, then the economy is much less error-tolerant. Thus, the problem of overinvestment is a reduced capacity for error-correction. If everyone decides to put their money to work now, then theoretically more can be accomplished at once, but at a much greater risk of failure. If a lot of cash-holders remain on the sidelines, then less can be ventured, but at a greater probability of success.

Because an error in one business can affect the businesses that depend on it, then when people are overinvested, not only is there a greater risk of error, but the consequences of errors are more severe. For example, suppose that two businesses, A and B, both make short-term errors that require correction. In a healthy economy, maybe one or the other would have failed, but the other would have been rescued, whereas in an overinvested economy, both fail. Now suppose that business C can tolerate either A or B failing to follow through on a deal, but not both. Then C also needs to be rescued. However, it too evidently fails as well.

Thus, it is possible, in an overinvested economy, for a small error to turn into a big error because there is no one prepared to fix it while it is small. This is an economic crash. When too many people become invested and not enough remain uncommitted, then everyone in the economy must move in lock-step with one another. In a healthy economy, there is a lot more room for everybody screw up.

"I don't want to get into a semantic argument so im not going to argue over what the proper definition of inflation is.

When I personally use the term inflation I mean it ONLY to be the expansion of the money supply and this would be independent of price action.  All things being equal an increase in money supply would make prices rise; however, prices may fall due to productivity increases--e.g. TVs, consumer electronics, etc.

My definition of inflation is internal to the money itself and does not factor in external factors that may also effect price.  

I think your definition renders it useless because it is an umbrella term that groups so many different factors.  To call a price increase due to a commodity shortage, increased demand, or an increase in the money supply the same thing makes no sense as these are VERY different things.

A lot of people will claim we have inflation around 2-3%.  That's bullshit.  What we have is a much greater expansion of the money supply and also at the same time productivity gains.  Lets say companies are being able to produce goods ~3-4% cheaper every year do to gains in manufacturing or technology improvements, and then the ALSO completely separate from this the amount of US dollars is increasing by 6-7%.  The NET aggregate price increase may be around 2-3% but to call this inflation is fucking retarded because it renders the term meaningless.

My guess is these are all grouped together because it helps hide the true cost of inflation.  If you define inflation this way, you need to break it up into the sub-components.";7;1;False;ztsmart;dmpsmzy;The difference between inflation and deflation...;6yn8hs;https://i.redd.it/zs4byvahrgkz.jpg

"Socialism is not without its own flaws and it still has a security force. I'd argue there hasn't been one successful example of its utopian vision on a macro level. I believe there are some positive aspects of socialism and better than capitalism in some ways but I'm not convinced it's better overall. The socialist countries I have visited often have lower crime but were in my opinion living at a much lower standard of living. They all had a roof over their heads but no toilet paper. Is that better? To some people maybe. 

There was still a police force. They force you to participate in a socialist society as much as the police force forces us to participate in a capitalist society. Try telling them you want to have your own business, or that you don't want to work for to government and see what happens. They still controlled the flow of information. Minimal access to the internet, not censored but inaccessible for most people and dreadfully slow.

If they want something, no one is entitled to a quantity of anything that exists. There are still costs that limit availability to the few that can afford them. The costs might not be monetary but there are still limiting factors. You still end up with the have and have nots.

There's minimal incentive to anything difficult like becoming a doctor to get paid the same as a garbage collector. Why go to school for 25 years to get paid the same? In a society where everyone is empathetic and altrustic the system should work. I just don't think that society exists.

"Dude, what extra money? Extra money causes crisis? Extra as opposed to 'normal' amount of money? Low interest rates motivate economic subjects to take out loans (i.e. creation of money) and then spend the money. Where does it go? To somebody else's account, i.e. back to the bank which allows the bank to provide another loan. This is called the multiplication effect. This is happening even if credit rate is 20%. Why? Because it is the basis of our economy. There is no problem there until massive amounts of loans are given to economic subjects that have no way of sustaining the payment schedule (this is in fact NEGATIVELY correlated with the credit rate), as the lending agency then immediately and fraudulently sells these loans to institutions which further securitize them and pass them off as investment-grade to poor idiots who get duped.

"Wew.

You're confused.  You haven't effectively called me out on anything.  You've skirted my main point, and nit-picked on what I already admitted was an intellectually lazy comment; because this is reddit, not my doctoral dissertation.  

So please, go right ahead and call me on what you find wrong with the dis-logic of citing market failure as one of the ""problems with capitalism"".  Because, remember, that's what this whole thread is about. . .

You:
>You used strong language 

Also you:
>seemingly hoping no one would call you on it.
>splashiness of that tactic whether intentional, or due to pathos and haste 

Supposedly my language was ""strong"" but your's wasn't?

I wouldn't call my language (""has empirically proven to be far superior"")  strong. . . I would call it lazy. . . which I already admitted do.  But again, please by all means continue your sophistry and trying to deflect from the point that: as far as the discipline goes which is best positioned to come to an informed consensus on this fact goes (i.e. economists); there is a massive body of research supporting the opinion that, and wide consensus among economists that ""capitalism"" as it is colloquially understood, within the context of western democracies; is by far the best economic system for producing growth, wealth, peace, and prosperity.  

Additionally, you took my question and made some assumptions that are just simply not the case:

>As to the rigor of social sciences, they do frequently make claims based on non repeatable research.

I didn't assert otherwise.  Don't confuse me asking the question as anything other than ferreting out from you what I figured (and was correct about) was your particular hang up regarding empirical work in the social sciences.

Economists are well aware that there are limitations to social sciences; especially in accounting for all relevant factors and variables, and not always being able to have a control or control group.

But you understand, right, that econometrics are a thing?  And that observational studies can approximate randomized experiments?  Also, there's a whole branch of economics dedicated to experimental econ.  So, no: the lack of a good control does not preclude empiricism.  Astronomers, as just one example (and theirs is considered a hard science) have to make observational studies quite frequently.  Reproducibility is a problem to some extent in all sciences (obviously it's going to be more so in social sciences). 

Most importantly; do you have a better way, or a better idea as to how to study social and psychological phenomena?  Just because imperfect; does that mean that there are a group of people who are more likely to have a better grasp or come to a better consensus than economists on issues of the production, consumption, and transfer of wealth?

If not, then what is actually your point? It's one thing to not jump to every conclusion drawn by every new study. . . but it's another thing to deny the validity of a very long-standing and highly uncontested consensus on the efficacy of capitalism and it's superiority over economic systems (and specifically what it has to say about the neo-socialist and anti-market non-sense that gets peddled and bandied about on reddit).

Did you see where I advocated for capitalism and free people? Free markets doesn't mean unregulated markets. Ultra ideological purity is a more extreme stance than trying to blend the best of multiple ideologies into a compromise. 

When you take freedom to the extreme, it results in lack of freedom. Should I be free to own slaves? A class of ultrawealthy individuals can make that happen unless some power opposes them. Today that power is government, but it's being assaulted by those ultrawealthy already. 

I don't care if the power is religion, the government, the masses, or a benevolent AI. Today, government is the one I distrust the least.

This is an extreme statement. If wealth concentration gets too high, the powers that control the wealth controls your freedom. In some eras, its the government, in some eras its the church, sometimes it's the mob of people itself, sometimes monarchs, or aristocracy, or the merchant class. 

Today, I believe corporations and authoritarians are the biggest threat. Extreme wealth inequality will make them worse and that's why I believe it needs to be redistributed.

Because I believe that markets and capitalism are powerful and useful forces, I don't think all the wealth needs to be redistributed. I believe it's ok for someone to be fabulously wealthy, but that initial wealth should be taxed so that by itself, it could only last 2-3 generations. Again, it doesn't need to be extreme and if the next generations actually build on the wealth, then they'll reset the clock. Those that sit on it and don't contribute to the world will see it dwindle. I believe a land value tax + UBI would be a good start in this direction. 

> ""extreme wealth concentration"" is ALWAYS dangerous, both in a socialist and in a free country.

Government and bureaucracy is inefficient, but if you value freedom and transparency that inefficiency + slowness is the price you pay. And yes, I agree the government goes too far in terms of privacy and secrecy in some places and I want those things to change for the better. 

No government is perfect, no human institution is.

I don't advocate for pure socialism. That's why I said all wealth doesn't need to be redistributed.

"**Land value tax**

A land/location value tax (LVT), also called a site valuation tax, split rate tax, or site-value rating, is an ad valorem levy on the unimproved value of land. Unlike property taxes, it disregards the value of buildings, personal property and other improvements to real estate. Land value taxes are generally favored by economists as (unlike other taxes) it does not cause economic inefficiency, and it tends to reduce inequality.

Land value tax has been referred to as ""the perfect tax"" and the economic efficiency of a land value tax has been known since the eighteenth century.

The Austrian business cycle theory (ABCT) is an economic theory developed by the Austrian School of economics about how business cycles occur. The theory views business cycles as the consequence of excessive growth in bank credit, due to artificially low interest rates set by a central bank or fractional reserve banks. The Austrian business cycle theory originated in the work of Austrian School economists Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek. Hayek won the Nobel Prize in economics in 1974 (shared with Gunnar Myrdal) in part for his work on this theory.

"> but wrong that everything just finds equilibrium and is the same

Not what I said.

>Buffet's shareholder letters from the 70's when there was huge inflation. He talks over many years about the decrease in company earnings relative to inflation. This made a huge percentage of companies during that time actually have negative earnings relative to government bonds.

Not sure how that's applicable.  As I clearly stated, ""in equilibrium"".  Economies never really reach equilibrium; but are in constant flux, in a never-ending process of equilibrating. Equilibrium is a useful thought-aid in economics.  You seem to be pointing to the problems of a shock or sharp change (which causes problems in changes towards inflation or towards deflation).  This is why I used the term ""in equilibrium"".  

Pointing to relatively deflationary (or rather, dis-inflationary) episodes within a secularly inflationary environment, or to an inflationary shock in a mildly inflationary environment, as you did, hardly proves or disproves anything.  Expectations and institutions themselves have to shift, in order to normalize and approach equilibrium.  The U.S. in the 70's was not in anything close to an environment where expectations and institutions had shifted to accommodate a more highly inflationary environment.  Transaction costs and market failures abound with sharp changes in either direction; and economists rightly fear short and medium term deflation upon our current environment (e.g. due to sticky wages, menu costs, etc.).

The argument here is theoretical, and/or based on a hypothetical future where bitcoin was and had been for a long period of time, a base money or reserve currency in a large economic sphere.  Bitcoin is not yet even money! [See here for why](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6u14b3/why_bitcoin_is_the_way_that_it_is_or_how_i/?ref=share&ref_source=link).

In that context, it is simply wrong to suggest that capital projects and growth (in real terms) can't possibly continue under slow steady deflation, as they would under slow steady inflation (again, there's other reasons why monetary policy is usually thought to best be slowly inflationary. . . but that is a whole other argument).";1;0;False;kwanijml;dmpxe28;The difference between inflation and deflation...;6yn8hs;https://i.redd.it/zs4byvahrgkz.jpg

"Couple basic economic theory points here:

Bitcoin is not money in the same way the dollar is. 

Deflation is really bad for a currency. 

Here's why: money is a medium of exchange, a store of value, and a unit of account. As a medium of exchange bitcoin fails, in the same way gold fails. It's not a true ""currency"" in the strict economic sense. While there are places that will accept bitcoin payments they mostly need to exchange that bitcoin into dollars or whatever the currency is for the country that they are in. 

In my mind, bitcoin functions more like a stock, its value is speculative and is tied to how much interest people have in it. You can't live exclusively with bitcoin anywhere in the world. 

But even if you insist that bitcoin and the dollar are comparable, that they are both currencies in the same way, you can't escape the fact that deflation is bad for a currency and this image makes it seem like a good thing. 

Sure, it's nice when less money buys more things, and this works to your advantage as a consumer of goods or the owner of debt. But if you owe any debts that are denominated in a certain currency, the number of units of that currency doesn't change regardless of if the value of the currency goes up or down relative to other currencies. If I borrowed from someone 50 bitcoins in 2015 and promised to pay them back those 50 bitcoins in 2017, I would be relatively worse off than if that debt contract had been on a currency that had not deflated over that time period. That is the very simple explanation for why deflation is not something to brag about in a currency. And if you think that it doesn't matter for bitcoin because bitcoin isn't used to lend and borrow money, then you begin to lean into my first point, about bitcoin not being a currency because it is not a true medium of exchange.";2;0;False;uhm_ok;dmqdd4h;The difference between inflation and deflation...;6yn8hs;https://i.redd.it/zs4byvahrgkz.jpg

Saving should be encouraged but people also have to spend. Saving doesn't make the economy go around, spending does. It's economics 101. Few people use bitcoin to buy goods.

"Deflation is one of the greatest threats to economic growth in the world. It causes people to horde wealth to obscene levels. Money leaves banks, and companies can no longer borrow cash to purchase capital and resources and pay for employees to make things. 

Hint: Car companies borrow money to make cars, sell the cars and then pay back the loan. It costs them .025% interest for a very short period of time, but it allows them to create inventory without needing to keep a huge amount of cash reserves. Otherwise, every car company would have to operate like tesla, with a car taking months to be delivered after you pay for it.

In a normal economy, Savings = Investments, because you don't hold on to cash. You put your money into a bank account, into the stock market, or into bonds. Savings accounts and bonds have interest rates that exceed the rate of inflation in general, while the stock market generally sees growth in excess of inflation, all of which make those investment options, and thus savings options, far better than holding on to cash.

Problem is that each of those types of savings has a different level of liquidity. It takes time to remove money from bonds, and there are usually some rules against taking more than a certain amount of money out of a savings account at a bank. Stock markets are the most liquid of those investment options, but also most volatile.

Bit coins are dangerous because they could disappear tomorrow, and their entire value is based upon speculation of their value. Because of their volatility, they will never be a viable currency. All that is happening at the moment is the bit coin is both being printed like a currency in Hyper inflation, and being valued as a currency that is in hyper deflation. It's absolutely retarded, and when it falls apart, billions of dollars will just vanish into thin air.

It really seems like the only purpose for bitcoins right at the moment is to clean dirty money. You can't really buy grocieries with it at the store, you can't buy lumber at the mill. The market for them to exchange for real things is very limited. It failed to catch, and it's be too much of a pain in the ass for shops to try and keep their prices up to date with the random pricing of the bitcoin.";1;0;False;;dmpyjgr;The difference between inflation and deflation...;6yn8hs;https://i.redd.it/zs4byvahrgkz.jpg

We are bonded by mutual constraint of actions, and mutual investments offer better returns.  100 individuals investing $100 each can do less than all of them putting it together and divvying up the returns off the collective investment.  The problem is how to trust that you will get your fair share.  That's where regulation comes in. 

There are some shared investments we don't even get a choice in, so it makes sense that you are born with certain societal obligations even though you never asked for them. Neither did anyone else, and they have to breath the air, too, so don't fart in the car. 

When a company makes a risky move like putting a pipeline over a river, that risk is farting in the car.  We can't hit the company. We can't hit each individual employees, when no 1 individual shoulders 100% of the responsibility.  That's why we need regulation.  We also need a death penalty for companies...

"The problem is that people don't realize currency has multiple purposes it needs to fulfill.

Dollars NEED to inflate because the amount of money needs to grow to sustain a growing economy. An economy growing without the money pool also growing makes the economy less efficient as hyper deflation is as dangerous as hyper inflation.

Currency also needs to inflate when selling or exporting, because why buy products with an expensive currency if cheaper currencies have the same product? Deflation only helps in buying but you can't buy if you can't sell your services because the conversion rate is shit.

Why buy an apple at 10 US dollars when you can buy it for 1 peso which is worth less than the US dollar?

Bitcoin is not used for large interactions with other economies nor is it required to grow to fit the economy because Bitcoin is not the accepted standard currency. Bitcoin has no other purpose than to hold value, it does not need to maintain a day to day economy.

So yes, in a deflationary system the people who hold become more wealthy.

But the vast majority of people will become worse off, and we are back to income inequality.

But because Bitcoin is accessible now, ""anyone can get in"" and so anyone has the chance to be one of the elite few in the coming years.

"Reposting these two comments I made in other threads:

""Inflation is a tax on patience. It biases present investment and consumption opportunities over future ones. You can think of savings as an investment in an economy that does not exist today but may in the future. It is a bet against the current array of opportunities which can help one avoid systemic risk.

If you think society is going the wrong direction, you can both avoid the pitfalls of that trajectory and help shift it by betting against the economy through saving instead of investing or consuming. It is basically a meta investment.""

""Savings can be understood as a potential investment in some future enterprise or consumption of a future good. So people do not and would not save indefinitely or for no reason, they are saving for when a suitable opportunity in line with their time preferences presents itself.

One thing your contingency ignores is self-employment. In a scenario where savings is extreme (and improbable), households may become more autarkic, meaning self-sufficient. This would reduce the division of labor and the efficiencies normally gained from it, but perhaps it may in certain situations (such as a widespread decrease in social trust) be rational. That is a minor point though, just to illustrate that an extreme level of savings could be rational.

Normally, the general level of savings would not be so extreme. Eventually, the increase in savings would cause entrepreneurs to accept very high interest rates on loans, above the rate of appreciation of the money unit. So, savers would make more money by investing than by saving. We can assume the level of savings would then equilibrate.

What would probably happen (under normal circumstances) in an economy with a deflationary currency is that time preferences would be reduced, which in a simplistic sense, means that people would be less wasteful, more prudent and patient, which would raise productivity. Additionally, long-term growth in productivity would be raised due to reduction in the severity of business cycles; the artificial severity that is caused by inflationary monetary policy.""

If deflation is at 2%, then the ROI on the machine is reduced relative to the currency. So there is less incentive to invest in the machine.
