Many institutional investors changed their views about the value of crypto in the past year and some of them started entering into crypto markets, bringing substantial demand for Bitcoin with themselves. In addition to all this, we are close to the next halvening of block reward in 2020, which will further constrain the supply of Bitcoin. All of this resulted in the steady rise of Bitcoin’s price in early 2019 and now we’re witnessing the FOMO effect.;1;0;False;alluva;etebrsg;13,0000 boys, we’re vertical again;c5rwel;https://i.redd.it/vv9hnuz19q631.jpg

"Nothing will be gained from bringing up the same tired talking points that /r/btc has been beating dead horses with for three years.

Don't like it? Fork it. That's what people in agreement with you have already done, but their products failed to convince the majority. Bitcoin core has a different vision for scaling than you do, that's all.

If you care so much, you should learn the math and programming and contribute. Of course you will probably find your fork going nowhere, because although there are a lot of people who agree with you, it seems that they can't accomplish much of anything without infighting and outright incompetence. Honestly I think the anti-core movement is summed up mostly as ""internet drama"", driven further by strong anti-Western influences coming from corporations based in China.

The actually productive projects that disagreed with bitcoin didn't try to con people with similarly named forks.

"That's because of the implementation of DDA in bch. Satoshi designed the halvening schedule and it is retained in bitcoin protocol, not bch protocol.

The clowns that forked bitcoin to create bch went against many of satoshi's implementations, one of them being the difficulty adjustment. Bch termed it as dynamic difficulty adjustment [DDA], where the difficulty is adjusted every 10 minutes. This is mainly intended by bcashers with the purpose to win the hash war back then during fork.

This is why bch implemented DDA to win hash back then (although we all know such attempt fail miserably):

1) immediately upon the fork, dump BTC for BCH temporarily to attract more hashrate to mine on the BCH fork, as mining bch is more profitable temporarily.

2) however as more miners are onboard and difficulty spike, bch become less profitable to mine unless the bch investor continue to prop up its price which is unsustainable. In order to retain the miners from switching back to btc, DDA will ensure miners get bch mining rewards every 10minutes.

3) however, majority users think bch fork does not work/ not the right scaling approach and continue to stay with btc. Most of the btc holders who get bch for free also proceed to dump bch. At one point mining on bch chain isn't even profitable enough although mining reward is guaranteed every 10minutes. Bch undergoes a massive dump as users compete to get rid of their bag.

"> You actually  wrote the book on it....

Indeed I did!

> So here is an honest question.  What is really going on on a trip? Is it purely hallucination or is it enhanced acuity?

That’s complicated to be honest. But the short answer is, “a bit of both”. 

The brain overall starts sending signals between regions kind of chaotically, which is likely responsible for the bulk of the hallucinatory aspects, however that’s only part of the story. LSD also reduces activity in two key areas: the thalamus and the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC).

One of the jobs of the thalamus is to route sensory information to the appropriate brain areas. In doing so though, it also performs pre-filtering, which is why if you’re not paying attention, there’s no way you can tell me the colours of the last 5 random strangers’ shirts you saw walking down the street. You saw them, but they got filtered out. LSD appears to disrupt the filter function without removing the “pass on to the rest of the brain” function. This is why it seems like - and in some ways really is - enhanced acuity. 

The PCC is responsible for uncontrolled attention and combining information with memory to get a consistent view of the world. Importantly, it’s a part of the Default Mode Network (DMN), which is pretty much responsible for your “sense of self” when behaving normally. Disruptions here from LSD are likely what causes feelings of “oneness” and not being sure of where you end and something else begins. In extreme cases, this losing coherence without you losing consciousness is what gets called “ego death”, where the sense of self is gone and only experience remains. 

> I have since added that it is perhaps some weird quantum manifestation of projected mind 

As far as I can discern, there are no significant quantum effects in the brain. And what we call “mind” is an illusion built from complex feedback loops (for more on that, read up on [Integrated Information Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_information_theory))

> but the trips frightened me too much and I got past being impressed by it after even the first trip to ever bother with exploring it again.

I always think that too. I was 28, had a decent job, was aware of bitcoin... But didn’t buy any. However I also remind myself if I would’ve bought like 500 coins back then, I probably would’ve sold them when it hit like $25... I would’ve made a nice profit, but now would constantly kick myself for selling them. It would always be hanging over my head that I had that many btc, but sold them waaaaay to early.

"I had a friend who was a sex worker and she needed me to place an ad for her on Backpage.  This was in September 2016.  Backpage ads were $5 in bitcoin.  I had just fell into $500 and I had been hearing about all this bitcoin stuff.  I thought bitcoin was stupid, I mean, fake digital money not backed by any government?  Then I went to youtube and watched a ""what is bitcoin"" video and my brain literally fucking exploded.  It was unreal, this was actually something that could soar to the fucking moon.  So, I bought $500 in bitcoin, placed her $5 ad for her.  

Then I had some life drama happened a few days after I bought and I literally 100% forgot about the bitcoin I bought.   

Fast forward to December 2017 and bitcoin is all in the news.  I then remember ""fuck, I have some bitcoin"" and I log into the site and BOOM!!!!  My $500 in bitcoin grew the fuck up.  

I cashed it out when Bitcoin hit $18k

Then, in November of 2017 I convinced my boss to add a Bitcoin Option for our online sales.  We then did $1600 in sales in a couple of weeks.  During this time, bitcoin dropped in value and our $1600 became $1400 and my boss freaked the fuck out and told me to sell.  I told him to hold that Bitcoin would go back up, but nope, he was adament, he didn't want to ""gamble"" anymore.  So, I told him I'd buy the bitcoin from him for $0.95 cents on the dollar and he agreed-- this was in November of last year.

Bitcoin will not replace money. It probably won't even be worth more than all the gold, but it could still go up a lot from here. There is however a practical limit to the price, and that is the cost of securing the network. As eco freaks like to whine, it already consumes all the electricity in Iceland. As the price increases, the number of miners also increases, but there are only so many Icelands on the planet, so there is a hard cap to how much juice we can realistically waste on mining, before enough large countries cut off the juice.;-2;1;False;HODL_monk;etewtzy;This sure did age well;cbalwd;https://i.redd.it/3x51z28nyd931.jpg

I mean, its an entire magazine dedicated to making money, yet they don't even mention the best performing asset of 2019. Its like nothing outside of stocks, bonds, and real estate even exists in their world !";7;1;False;HODL_monk;etex3s2;This sure did age well;cbalwd;https://i.redd.it/3x51z28nyd931.jpg

I suggest focusing on what you CAN do rather, work, learn (dev/ai/analytics/python/robotics) amass knowledge, turn it into fiat by showing off skillz online doing odd jobs. They don’t care about age, and convert that into gold, silver, and then blow what you can afford on bitcoin when legal. That being said, plenty ways to get bitcoin under the radar, it is just a premium usually, but hell bitcoin swings 15% in a day, so what if it costs a little more now, this is the long game. Bonus jf bitcoin does die your still a smart mofo with a yacht in your early 30’s by catching the next tech wave and staying on top of it.;1;1;False;VertigoOne1;etgkko6;This sure did age well;cbalwd;https://i.redd.it/3x51z28nyd931.jpg

"Never too late to put in whatever you feel comfortable with every paycheck.
Who knows 1% of your weekly wage could end up being a years salary.
If not, you wouldn't have lost much.
And you would always buy the tops and bottoms.";3;1;False;enbydend;etepqbs;This sure did age well;cbalwd;https://i.redd.it/3x51z28nyd931.jpg
"It's never too ""late"" to own something that nobody can take away from you.  If that interests you, I'd recommend you find out about it.

If you really only want to make  money I'd recommend doing something else. Not because I don't think btc will go up, a lot, but if you don't believe in it you will rationally sell as soon as it moves one way or another - like lots of ppl in this thread who (supposedly) got out at $10 or whatever.";2;0;False;jaydoors;etest1u;This sure did age well;cbalwd;https://i.redd.it/3x51z28nyd931.jpg

"The reason why the Dollar Cost Averaging strategy works is because you are saving less money than you need to, so you have less invested and can stomach the ups and downs a lot more easily.

The other reason why it works is because despite the sheer amount of support that it has, very few people actually use DCA. It takes a level of dedication that even hardcore savers cannot stick to. I had a friend who joined me in doing DCA and when the price dropped below $3,500 in November 2018, told me he just couldn't justify buying anymore. Had he kept purchasing at the November and December levels, when everything was in despair for him, he would have made the single best trades of the last year and a half, however.";1;0;False;Yorn2;etfrmpn;This sure did age well;cbalwd;https://i.redd.it/3x51z28nyd931.jpg
