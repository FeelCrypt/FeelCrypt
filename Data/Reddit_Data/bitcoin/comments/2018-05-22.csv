>Btc is  currency like jpy USD EUR. Why should it get converted first

And that’s the difference between state supported fiat and a bunch of random numbers adored by nerds. The difference between real money and monopoly money. 

And even if it were a real currency, currencies are interchangeable. That’s one of the properties of currencies: they’re interchangeable for goods, they’re interchangeable for other currencies. 

In reality, BTC is an imaginary commodity, like loot boxes and skins. And with commodities, you are made whole, based on the value at the time of the loss. If someone wrecks your car new car in 2010 and it takes 8 years for the courts to decide, you get the value of a new car, not an 8 year old car.

"hello to all.
my thinking is this.
1)hidden in plain  sight. so i think  is it simple.
there are 12 words with medium or large font that have marked with numbers.
the clue said.
 1)one must look within (within the circle i think)
2)(to infinity and beyond) the infinity symbol is within the circle.

my only problem is X MARKS THE SPOT as it is not the last word (x=10)

this are they word that are marked with numbers inside the circle.
only inside the circle there are words marked from 1 to 12.
one + also is that many words are pairs,  two times marked.
if you find the puzzle with my help dont forget me i am a good guy that shares :)

1=without

2=chain

3=attacker

4=transaction (or)transactios

5=per (or )course

6=Nodes or maybe is still

7=transaction

8=node

9=Nodes	

10=attacker

11=timestamp

12=timestamp

another way that i see it by accident.

if you bucket paint the x mark this letters paint also.

"I don't believe the  [2] [7] [5] theory. The Brackets are just for random references. I stand strong with my guess of 257=Sha256+1=2^(8)+1 = marking the X , because this hints that there are 24 words and the X was the clue for the +1 passphrase. He also had **+1 as a clue**. It's too obvious for me. What's more: the **visible part**  of 257  (=""25"") was there nearby X, so I had an epiphany that this was the 25th word=passphrase. If I ever constructed  such a puzzle, I would put it that way. I mean, **there has to be a hint that we're looking for 24 words**, so that was my logical shot. 257 makes perfect sense for my theory of **2^(8)+1** which not only reveals that we're looking for 24 words (and NOT 12 or 18), but 257 was also in accordance with the clue **""+1""** and also in accordance with my theory of **visible part of 257 (just the ""25"")  = 25th word = ""+1 word"" = passphrase**";4;3;False;migmxke;dzddiyk;1 BTC is hidden in this puzzle.

"If all clues are still relevant, it means that none of them were related to the passphrase/derivation path/whatever was the next step. Which leads me to think that the puzzle is set up in such a way that once someone finds the correct words, they will have a pretty good idea how to do the second step, which makes the easing of the puzzle by removing the second step strange, especially since it seems that no one has even got that far. Or if ""Try +1"" is now annulled, then it's not true that all clues are still valid, or you don't consider that an official clue.

Also, regarding the comment ""it will not affect current progress"" - if what was removed was a passphrase or a derivation path, then it **will** affect current progress, because we have tested seeds without passphrases and different derivation paths, which means we would have to try everything again, in the search for the new address. Unless we are way off about the thing which was removed, but I'm not sure how can the second step be completely separate from the first.";1;0;False;PaleProgrammer;dzdglu9;1 BTC is hidden in this puzzle.

"Thank you, your comment made me want to look it up and learn more about it. [From the wiki](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Private_key#Hierarchical_Deterministic_.28HD.29_Wallet_Keys):

>Wallet software may use a BIP 32 seed to generate many private keys and corresponding public keys from a single secret value. This is called a *hierarchical deterministic wallet*, or *HD wallet* for short. The seed value, or *master extended key*, consists of a 256\-bit private key and a 256\-bit *chain code*, for 512 bits in total. The seed value should not be confused with the private keys used directly to sign Bitcoin transactions.

I didn't know about the term ""master extended key"" and that it was 512 bits, a 256\-bit private key and a 256\-bit something called chain code.

"When he transferred between his public addresses, I think he just **removed his original passphrase**, therefore we have **1 less step** to solve. (like he **literally** said). That extra (final boss) step would originally be to find the passphrase (=25th word). I estimate that **both addresses** (his old and new) are **still derived from his same private key** (24 word seed). A passphrase was probably included **only in the old address**. The original puzzle had probably **25 words (24 bip words+ 1 passphrase)** and now it probably has just the original **24 bip words (23 cherry picked and 1 checksum word**), but with **no passphrase**. But still seems hard af. I'm sure he understood that the mnemonic seed was hard enough to solve, let alone finding any extra lost passphrase. 
 
In my opinion, the small **X** inside the rectangle, marked near the number **25** (of 257) giving clue for the (now removed) **passphrase=25th word**. And the nearest word in X is ""**lost**"" (it's not a bip word, but it was included in 1 of his [clues:](http://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Screenshot-2018-5-21-1-BTC-is-hidden-in-this-puzzle-Good-luck-•-r-Bitcoin.png) ""**Lost transaction costs among users**"". 
So, if I ever got so close near the solution with all my guessed 24-word seed correct , I would just put 'lost' as a passphrase or manually brute-forcing something like that. (Lost, lost257, Lost257, lost25, Lost25, 25lost, 25Lost, l.o.s.t., l-o-s-t, l_o_s_t, LOST, LostX,  etc.) because the **passphrase is case sensitive** (both in ledger and trezor). But even so, I think the passphrase would be easy for me to **crack** in Python (or even manually), compared to the rest seed.

But maybe that 257 number is  also meant to mean **256+1**.  It's clear to me, that **257=2^(8)+1 = 8 bits +1** = **24 words + 1 extra** (""the passphrase"") so I bet the seed has **8x3=24 words (the bip mnemonic seed is always a multiple of 3 words=1 bit**. (according to the BIP specifications in Github)
 
 I mean, there **had to be somewhere a hint that we were looking for 24 words and NOT 12 or 18**, so my 257 theory makes sense. At least now, with my theory, I'm almost sure  that we're looking for 24 words, and we can steer the suggestions and the whole research towards **24-word seed** and **NOT 12/18 word** seeds. 

 I also searched (""ctrl+F"") the Satoshi whitepaper for the number ""257"" but it can't be found anywhere. It's **impossible** that ""257"" appeared in this **word cloud** out of nowhere. So it was just probably **set up** in that specific X spot as a part of the puzzle.   Too bad the passphrase is  probably removed now, that's why I write what I would otherwise keep it for myself, if I ever got so close to the end. My work on the passphrase doesn't matter now, because his passphrase was probably removed. 
  
At least, I just wanted to let you guys know,  that **to me now, it's almost sure that the seed words are 24, and neither 12 nor 18**. So, you can now steer your own research only towards the **24-word seed** and ditch the simplistic 12 word combinations. Anyway, I just put a few logical scenarios. And with a passphrase or not, this puzzle is still somewhat brutal, unless more hints are given. Good luck.

"The implicit assumption in the statement ""you can't figure out how to view OP's comments"" is that I toiled away on this for hours and just couldn't figure it out. Geez, I must be one dumb cunt. What the fuck am I even doing on this post? In reality, I looked for all of 3 seconds, didn't find it in that time (maybe you have some time limit in mind, that is directly correlated with IQ score?) and since a work meeting was starting, posted that I couldn't find it and probed for more information from all the helpful people here at Reddit.

If you think that's bullshit, then fine. Check the post timestamps. Oh, you don't know how to do that? Neither do I. I have never done it before (not psychic either), but if it is possible and you figure it out, you will see how little time I spent.

Another assumption you pluck out of thin air is that I am here because I am working on this problem. I'd love to, but I don't have the time. I was actually showing my daughter.

Maybe the irony that your claimed irony is based purely on assumptions that you have projected into this context is not lost on you?

1. I think the words are completely irrelevant
2. We are presented with values for ""z"" and values for ""q"". There are also seemingly random numbers, of which the number 25 is the most relevant. 
3. I guess we are meant to iterate through the values for ""z"" and ""q"" with using a logic condition to test if ""k"" \> ""z"" and using incremental counters, k\+\+ & i\+\+. I also think we are testing for a number sequence of sorts
4. I have no ideas as yet

6. See point 3 above, this could be an error handler which executes code to insert missing numbers into the sequence we are testing for.

"I thought it had to do with the nature of a butterfly. The dance of a butterfly is delicate and fleeting by its nature, kind of coming and going leaving no real consequence behind. A “bull run” would be quite the opposite, strong and charging, driving up the price spiking the testosterone levels of all crypto holders bringing them dreams of lambos and Courvoisier. Now the young animated lad looks at first glance to be happy and contented with the 4% gain day. But if you look long enough at him you can see the short smile is just a facade masking the quiet desperation he has felt for months. His eagerness to greet this 4% gain as a “bull run” betrays him, and he moves to aggressively to greet the butterfly. The butterfly turns and scurries away, just another fleeting opportunity that will be lost to the sands of time. He now has to return to the doldrums of his life without lambos and Courvoisier.

">But right here, you would be going against your own interests then to vote for, or not vote against, the ""team"" that does want to make moral decisions about what you do with your body. You can obviously disagree on other aspects of their platform, but that is an example of how you do agree with a particular side. Further, a lot of voters are mobilized on this single issue alone, particularly among those that do want to make moral decisions about your body.

You're assuming we need a bureaucratic body to make decisions for us. I don't assume or agree with that idea.

>This is another confusing bit for me, because you acknowledge it's the corporations but lay the blame at government for trying to implement legislation to check the corporations. It's those private interests that are lobbying against Net Neutrality, and who try to capture regulatory agencies (as they have done with this administration's FCC) because the free market actively conspires to make itself less free. This also seems to mean that you again would be more naturally aligned with a particular ""team"" over the other.

Corporations are just branches of government. In order to form a corporation, you must submit to and partner up with the government. So without government, the internet would be much more free and open- nobody could just grant these corporations a monopoly on the market like the government does. With a Net Neutrality law, you are simply saying ""we trust the government to make the internet neutral."" To me that is no different than saying you trust corporations to make the internet neutral. 

>I agree, it's foolish to think either side can fix everything, or that either have been or could be perfect representatives. But you're letting perfection be the enemy of good. First and foremost, voter apathy (which is often due to the assertion that both sides are the same, which is why I'm engaging you on this) is the biggest culprit. It means that there are huge swaths of the population that representatives don't have to represent. If more people voted for the least worst option, eventually you start moving upwards until the acceptable options get increasingly better. Instead, the Overton Window has moved sharply to the extreme right, and Eisenhower would be called a spineless socialist today. Instead of continual progress, it's a race to the extreme, and to the bottom.

Perfection? No. We don't even have a semblance of a peaceful, prosperous system where the most amount of people benefit. Voting and 50%+1 majority rules doesn't work. Neither does handing ""representation"" off to those who are bought and paid for. Politicians have always stood in the way of progress and that is not changing anytime soon. So no, I won't be voting for either ""side"", which is anti-progress.

>Then vote, especially in primaries where you have more power to select a candidate who does more closely align with your views. Without being engaged civically, it's just empty complaining about how ineffectual the government is, while giving yourself a way out of having to learn more about the issues or candidates. And that is lazy. The government is nothing more than people, and will only function as well as the people it's composed of are. It's failed in many ways, and yet also built national infrastructure, put a man on the moon, and created the internet. It also regularly does a massive amount of other tasks that completely and positively affect our daily lives that go unnoticed because that's not worthy of headlines.

All those were accomplished by men. We don't need government to build roads, men have figured out how to do that. You're confusing the idea that we need to have an organization that runs things with threats of violence in order to have a society. We don't. We can figure things out ourselves without overlords or voting (which can also be called a suggestion box for slaves, since politicians rarely even carry out what voters want).

>The US has and its system has had many failures, but also many triumphs. Unfortunately, top-down hierarchical structures will have to exist in any enterprise, public or private. The only alternatives are anarchy, from which hierarchies based on power and resources will still emerge like the warlords of Somalia, or a fully post-state society like Marxist communism, which is unlikely until humans are completely post-scarcity. So, if we have to deal with these hierarchies barring major and likely disastrous change, it makes sense to me to continually work towards a better version of it.

Says you. Decentralization works in every area. Hierarchies are not necessary, they are just what we have come to know.

>I'm a big believer in cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. But I think looking at fiat is a good example of why I think that, barring complete catastrophe, current power structures are here to stay. Fiat's value is backed by the full faith and credit of the US government, which is the best guarantee of value you can have. The reason is because for that to no longer mean something, the nation would have to have completely unraveled, and any way in which that could happen would mean complete global disaster.

Full faith and credit? What does that mean? The same organization who is $21 trillion in debt? Do you really put faith in them? And, this is the problem bitcoin solves. A centralized system created the federal reserve, which prints money and takes it out of your and my bank accounts. Bitcoin's major asset is it is a decentralized currency. I'm surprised you haven't read about this central tenant of bitcoin, and are still clinging to the idea that fiat currencies will be around forever because faith.";1;0;False;plentyoffishes;dzdz6ov;Is this a bull run?;8kzzay;https://imgur.com/EEkCke2
