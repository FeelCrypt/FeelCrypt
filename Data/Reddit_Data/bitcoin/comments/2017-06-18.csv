"Possibly, but very unlikely. This is people's stored value they are talking about. Not something like a myspace page where it's as easy as changing to facebook. Even Ethereum people seem to think as a ""competitor"" but if you actually know anything about the platforms you know that they are completely different things that serve different purposes, and have pros and cons. Where Ethereum exceeds, it gave up other things that bitcoin has that will bite it in its ass. The future world is one with many atomic transactions where people chose money that fits their needs, and can convert instantly to whatever whoever they are paying wants. 

Also, not only does bitcoin get the first mover/founder award, it is open source, and the ledger is really what makes bitcoin bitcoin. It is more like comparing ""internet"" to TCP/IP. Sure TCP/IP is the fundamental protocol for the ""internet"" but that doesn't mean that the ""internet"" won't ever receive upgrades in the future. By being open source, bitcoin sets the bar that all other projects be open source. So if another project shows to be better than bitcoin, we simply adopt their code and continue on with the ledger. 

There's a reason countries are focused on ""Bitcoin et all"" and not ""Ethereum et all"" or ""Litecoin et all"".

If it hits $100k per coin I'd consider it. My investment was made with money I don't need, so I'm really just in it to see what happens. To be honest, I'm not even convinced bit coin is the future. It may be another block chain tech that ultimately prevails. One of the major draws for me is that earnings yield in the stock market is pretty much zero and we are due for a major pull back. Schiller p/e has been higher only two other times in recent history, the 1930's crash and the internet bubble. Here's my one problem with digital currency, when there is a giant cyber attack (and there will be one day) that takes the internet down, digital currency will be worthless and hard assets like gold and even cash become much more valuable. Also not convinced that Trump gets a second term.;6;2;False;bundleogrundle;dj27m6n;Newbies to Bitcoin right now;6huazt;http://i.imgur.com/fx33rLx.gifv
