I'm not sure then, I haven't checked in some time but it would make sense that they are the same.  Maybe someone who knows more about that particular indicator can chime in.  The price has held fairly steady because there is a lot of buy pressure holding it up and that's why the indicator shows Buy.

Well yeah, I'm with you, but I also know that a not-insignificant number of people who ignore a bitcoin sticker now will definitely notice it once the price hits $100k or higher. The things that draw me to bitcoin aren't going to come into play in that kind of situation. Again, I recognize it is overly paranoid, especially since I live in a fairly small town with almost no violent crime, but it's just how I decided to operate. I still spend plenty of time talking to people about bitcoin (I run a bitcoin meetup in my area), but I just personally started to feel weird broadcasting it to strangers. You do you, man.

"Explaining just doesn't work with this kind of person. If you tell them it were 100% renewable they'd still be against it because they think ""that electricity could be used for something else.""

They don't understand simple supply and demand economics. They think that if Bitcoin weren't using that electricity from renewable energy, that somebody would still be putting the effort into producing it. That's obviously not the case. Electricity is generated to meet demand. It is incredibly costly to store, so no electricity company is going to deliberately generate greatly in excess of the demand at which they can sell it for a reasonable price. Electricity companies do generate some excess in order to ensure they have fault tolerance, and they use the excess to try and sell into new markets because it becomes discounted, but there's only so much they can discount.

It is no coincidence that there is an inseparable link between **climate scammers** and socialists. It is, after all, socialism that the climate scammer is trying to shill to you.

">“Spontaneous” payments

>One of the most frequently requested features for Lightning has been the ability to send “spontaneous” payments, in which the receiver of a payment doesn’t need to be involved in the payment ahead of time and doesn’t have to generate an invoice before the payment is sent. These “spontaneous” or “push” payments are more like what Bitcoin users have grown accustomed to, as opposed to invoice-based systems like credit cards. In lnd v0.9-beta, we’re introducing an experimental feature called Keysend that allows for spontaneous, invoice-less payments. Like Multi-Path Payments, Keysend uses custom TLV onion payloads to transmit the payment preimage so that a payment receiver can settle payments without an invoice. A future release of lnd will also support AMP, which is essentially a sharded Keysend payment that supports additional features such as recurring payments.

Schnorr signatures allows more efficient use of blockspace so we have more transactions per block without increasing resource costs

"\> do they differ in terms of what information is originally broadcast on-chain, etc?

Both public and private channels are created by depositing some Bitcoin into P2WSH address. It does not differ from other P2WSH addresses - it's just some sort of ""script"" output, ""probably multisig account"", as seen by others. Could be LN, could be any other contract.

Difference is that public channels are advertised and you can see them in LN explorers like [1ml.com](https://1ml.com). Public channels are recorded in Lightning Network graph, which is synced across LN nodes, so other nodes can calculate routes via these public channels to make LN payments via multiple ""hops"", if needed.

If you create private channel, only your counter-party (the node you created channel with) knows that you have a channel which corresponds specific funding transaction on the blockchain, but this information will not be published by your or that over node, so absent from LN graph. Meaning, you will be able to sped via that channel, but some other distant node will not be able to route via your private channel. Well, until some specific feature is implemented but not get too deep into it.

I can't suggest you some specific resource, but maybe you would find more info in [https://www.lopp.net/lightning-information.html](https://www.lopp.net/lightning-information.html) .";5;1;False;Talkless;ff9isll;Differences between public and private (unannounced) LN channels?;ese306;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ese306/differences_between_public_and_private/

"\>  **so we can exit the current system controlled by the 1%**

When are the 99% going to realise that the wealth of the 1% is not held in cash or bank accounts or gold or any other non-income generating asset classes? This myth that the definition of being wealthy is just having a big bank account with $Ms or $Bs of dollars is part of the reason the rich stay rich and the poor stay poor, because no one ever got rich putting their wealth in a bank account. The 1% don't care about control over the monetary system itself - controlling tech, investing and business empires is far more lucrative than running a central bank. Hyperinflation, currency collapses, whatever - none of that matters much to them because most don't hold cash positions as a major part of their portfolio. In fact a lot of the wealthiest people are cash negative (i.e. their debt-leveraged positions are larger than their cash balance).

The total amount of all money in circulation is infinitesimally smaller than the total wealth held by the global 1%, which is over $150 Trillon. Property, stocks, bonds, businesses and other income generating assets will always be worth orders of magnitude more in aggregate than dollars or bitcoins. Even if bitcoin replaced gold, most of it will end up held by whales who were already wealthy. If you just replace one kind of asset with another, the wealth inequality pyramid will stay stacked just as it is today.

TL:DR there is absolutely nothing that Bitcoin or any other crypto can do about wealth inequality. The 1% will still be the 1%.";2;1;False;datageek9;ffa8jk2;Retail Accumulation?

Wealth attracts wealth and it's like gravity.  The more you have  the more you keep.  So eventually you end up with just a few massive money wells.  It always happens that way.  The cost of living is the same, but saving and interest rates work in your favor when you have wealth and they work against you when you don't.

Study after study has shown that people who come into sudden wealth usually end up losing it.

"I was thinking about the economic implications if Bitcoin replaced cash. Since rich people tend to hold more cash and the poor spend it as they get it, it seems like putting a stop to inflation would benefit the rich more. Also, if everyone were to start holding cash in their wallets instead of putting it in the bank then there would be a lot less cash available for lending and the result would be higher interest rates. Since the fed couldn’t print cash, it would be much harder for them to offer bonds to control the rate; they would need to raise taxes just to have enough cash to back their bonds. There would need to be a new scheme that would allow consumers to offer up the balance of wallets for lending where they could still be able to withdraw bitcoin when they needed, which would probably be the same as the bank reserve system.";1;0;False;somewhat_irrelevant;ffa2jir;Retail Accumulation?

- Be sure to always move your Bitcoin to new address first before claiming, otherwise it's likely you'll lose them

- Claim in the order of 'worth much' to 'worth nothing'

- When claiming BSV from BCH don't forget there's no replay protection implemented with BSV meaning you have to securely split BSV off BCH before moving them (there are guides out there, just look them up)

- Coinomi wallet is a good way to get in control of the different resulting shitcoins but don't forget it's closed source and there's some trust involved

- There are further claiming methods (via split/claim scripts) which may be more secure but also more complicated

- **In the end sell all these claimed shitcoins for real Bitcoin (BTC)!**

"So I understand this correctly that you want the raspberry pi to recognize the synced blockchain data from the HDD?

If that is the case, you can either run the bitcoind command with the datadir option which you have to point to your bitcoin folder on the USB device, for example ""bitcoind --datadir=/media/$USER/blockchain/bitcoin/"" 
(sudo necessary)

it is also possible to create a "".bitcoin.conf"" file (usually in the home directory) and specify the path to the bitcoin core installation (again point to the bitcoin folder) like above, whatever you like more.

"Futures require people to take both sides of the bet. If you want to “buy” a cash-settled future at $10k, what you’re really doing is going long on the future. Additionally, you have to find a counter-party to go short at $10k. If you can’t then you have to change the price until you find an agreeable counter-party. The net position on futures is always 0. Every long requires and equal and opposite short.

Cash-settled futures aren’t physical, so they don’t affect the supply cap of 21M.

Let’s say the physical bitcoin is trading at $10k and the futures are at $9k. I’ll go long a future at $9k and short physical bitcoin at $10k (the physical asset is sometimes called the “underlying”). Now I have $1k cash in my pocket, and my net exposure to the underlying price is 0. That’s called arbitrage. This is great! Let’s do it again! In fact, I’ll do it so much that I’ll drive the price of the future up and drive the price of the underlying down until they meet and I can no longer make money. This demonstrates how arbitrage can only be short-lived, because traders will gobble up all the free money and fix the market prices.";7;2;False;hairyblackhole;ff9b0s3;CME Bitcoin options volume is surging just one week after launch;es9tqw;https://decrypt.co/17255/cme-bitcoin-options-volume-surging-one-week-after-launch?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=sm
Can you explain? Couldn't they sell an unlimited amount of cash-settled BTC futures as long as they have the value in fiat to back it up? E.g. at a Bitcoin price of $10.000 they could sell 1 million bitcoins as long as they have 10 billion USD in reserve (fractional reserving not even taken into account). Despite owning 0 real bitcoins. So even if there's no different in price between cash-settled futures and real bitcoins... the supply can be artificially inflated beyond 21 million which can cause downward pressure on the price.

"The CME and banks have used futures to restrict/manipulate silver and gold prices for years. Precious metal investors complained about this manipulation for over a decade with data collected that proved this manipulation...but it continued until just last year. And likely still gets manipulated.

I don't believe that future trading of Bitcoin was allowed for any other reason than it allows industry oversight with its speculators and high-level manipulation to control its price. 

Perhaps you want better price control, less volatility, and big banks to control bitcoin so the USD remains the world's reserve currency?

"Let's say I start up a bitcoin ETF. I pool together people's funds and use them to buy financial instruments with the goal of the value of these instruments tracking the price of the underlying (bitcoin). The financial instruments could be physical bitcoin, or they could be something else. As long as there is low tracking error the manager is satisfied.

When you want to buy a share of the ETF you have to find a seller. If you can agree on a price then there is a sale. If you can't then there is no sale. The ownership of that share of the ETF changes hands and that is a taxable event. The holdings of the ETF do not change, so there is no taxable event that the ETF manager would have to pay taxes on. This is one of the big tax advantages of ETFs over mutual funds.

Shares in the ETF have a price determined by the market. Shares in the ETF also have a ""net asset value"", or NAV. If the ETF as a whole holds 1 BTC, the market price of BTC is $10k, and there are 100 shares in the ETF, then the NAV is $100 (= 1 BTC * $10k/BTC / 100 shares).

If there is some mania and investors drive up the price of the ETF to $200 while the NAV is still $100, there is a way to correct this. In the setup of the ETF certain people are given special creation/annihilation powers. In this case, a the ETF manager can create a new share in the ETF by taking $100 (the NAV) from a creator, and give that creator a share of the ETF that has a current market price of $200. The creator will keep doing this until the market price equals the NAV. This is arbitrage, like I described in the explanation of futures, and it keeps the price of the ETF equal to the NAV. This creation/annihilation power is public knowledge, so the price and the NAV remain the same because no investors want to give away their money to the arbitragers.

ETA: Also, most (crypto) debit card companies lack severly in the information that can be found on their sites. And for all the different blogs and whatnot out there that try to summarize the available cards the info is either incorrect (outdated) or plain false.

"There is no single ""bitcoin price"".  Each exchange has its own herd of traders and is reporting its own trades.  In some countries (Venezuela, Argentina, Iran), it sells at a premium relative to global markets (after accounting for currency conversion rates, which sometimes aren't easy to calculate because of ""official rates"" versus real-world black-market rates) because the currency is devaluing rapidly.

Oh, and of course, most exchanges list buy/sell prices which include their own fees and their own bad fiat rates, while ""the price"" is roughly halfway between the two (assuming buy/sell demand is equal).

If you want a first-world aggregate, Coinmarketcap.com isn't bad.  They have to muddle through currency conversion issues and ignore data from those price-premium countries in order to give a more accurate global price, though.";2;0;False;thesmokecameout;ff8l55z;Wtf where am I supposed to look for an accurate bitcoin price?;es8r43;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/es8r43/wtf_where_am_i_supposed_to_look_for_an_accurate/

"There are no minimums (no maximums either), but a very general rule is that if you are a maker with larger offers, you probably will have more takers (because there is less competing offers on the market). But it's ok to start even with smaller amounts, since a coinjoin round will take multiple maker's offers, and it also has a random element when it selects which offers to take anyway, as far as I understand.  

And yes, it's absolutely trustless. The coins don't leave your wallet. They just go from one mixdepth to another, which essentially means they move from/to addresses within your own wallet.

"If you are looking to Buy bitcoin with fiat money, then the methods available will differ based on a few factors:

- Where are you located (country)?
- How much are you looking to buy?
- What payment methods do you have available?
- How soon do you need access to the proceeds?
- Is financial privacy important?

You indicated you are in the U.S., and that you would like to pay with a debit card.

The short answer ... Cash App.  That does require first that you complete the identity verification/KYC and become verified.   Otherwise, ... read on.

First time buyers may like the convenience of an online store that sells bitcoin and accepts debit and/or credit card. I do not know which ones require ID verification/KYC beyond those marked as such. (e.g., [Switchere](https://switchere.com) [**NO-KYC**], [Rebiton](https://rebiton.com) [**NO-KYC**], [Bitsell X](https://bitsellx.com) [[💳](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card)] [**NO-KYC**], [CoinCorner](https://coincorner.com) [[💳](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card)] [**NO-KYC** when £900 or less], [CEX.io](https://CEX.io.com), [Coinify](https://www.coinify.com), [Paybis](https://paybis.com), [Jubiter](https://app.jubiter.com/neworder/buy), [Bittylicious](https://bittylicious.com), [BitIreland](https://bitireland.ie), [Kuna.io Money](https://money.kuna.io), [LiteBit.eu](https://www.litebit.eu/en/buy), [Conio.com](https://conio.com) App, [CryptoVoucher.io](https://cryptovoucher.io), [GetSatoshi.org](https://getsatoshi.org) ([⚡](https://lightningnetworkstores.com/wallets)), [Cash App](https://cash.app/bitcoin) and CoinMama). You can buy BTC on Cash App without ID but you won't be able to withdraw them until you are KYC verified.

Here's a useful comparison of exchanges in which you can filter on payment method:

- https://exchangewar.info  <-- Filter box for currency (e.g., EUR) or payment method (e.g., VISA)


Otherwise, an in-person cash trade or an online trade using a P2P trading exchange may possibly be your next best option.  This would be similar to what you found on LocalBitcoins though:

*P2P Trading exchanges*

- [Person-to-person (P2P) Trading Exchanges](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/dyclf8)
- https://exchangerates.pro  <-- Choose country and/or Payment Method

Using gift cards, there is [CardCoins](https://www.cardcoins.co) for paying with a non-reloadable, prepaid GIFT card (VISA/Mastercard/AMEX/Discover),  [CryptoVoucher.io](https://cryptovoucher.io) for paying with gift cards for numerous brands, [Redeem](https://www.redeeem.com/gift-cards), and [BitOf](https://bitof.io/) for paying with Amazon UK gift cards).


You can purchase online using a No-KYC online store, paying by depositing cash in a bank account or through Moneygram/Western Union:

- [BitQuick QuickBuy](https://www.bitquick.co/quick-buy) [**NO-KYC** (when trx amount is under $400)]

There are physical locations where there are Bitcoin ATMs and other vending/voucher methods.  For example, in the U.S. there is:

- https://coinatmradar.com  <-- Some will require Identity verification/KYC, others just a phone number (e.g., CoinFlip ATMs, when $900 or less), or nothing at all
- https://www.coinstar.com/bitcoin (with [2,200+ locations in the U.S.](https://coinme.com/kiosks))  <-- Identity verification/KYC
- https://libertyx.com/a/buy/locations  <-- Cashier (cash), and/or Kiosk (debit card)
- https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/dabf2m  <-- Some will require identify verification/KYC, but not all will.

"> proceed to give me e-mail address on whatsapp for paypal

There's your problem.   All communications should be done on the platform (i.e., in the trade chat window).     I can't get to that screen now, but Paxful has, if I remember correctly, VERY CLEAR instructions about that in that chat window and you have to even type something in to acknowledge the warning.   

[This spot in their HowTo video](https://youtu.be/EjB5qFW0bJ8?t=106) is where that warning should show, but I think they added that warning to their trade chat window after this video was recorded.

The fact that you didn't send any money until after opening the second trade means that you missed this caution/warning in the text chat window TWICE.

> and then gave him the address.

So, ... the whole point of using a P2P trading exchange versus something like Craigslist is that the trading exchange provides escrow for the seller's coins.  You would never give an address to a seller, because they don't send the coins to you.   

So ya, ... that scammer found an easy mark, sorry to say.   Not saying improvements couldn't be made, ... but .... there was a lack of following instructions on your part.

Now, as far as Paxful's responsibility, ... if you have chat history on Whatsapp, they could (and should) conclude that it is warranted to close the account on the dude with the first ad, as that's where the Whatsapp number came from.     Hopefully you are able to get at least that far with Paxful support (which, sometimes can be difficult to communicate clearly with).

There are only a few exchanges that accept PayPal due to it being easily reversed:

- xCoins.io
- CanCoin.com

"The risk of PayPal is borne by the seller, not the buyer.  This was clearly a Paxful issue, where a new user didn't understand either the process, nor the risks at all.

I just checked, ... to be charged exactly $60, you buy $57.59 USD worth, and get 0.00660537.  At the [current ""global"" exchange rate](https://bitcoinaverage.com/en/bitcoin-price/btc-to-usd), $8,640.50, that 0.00660537 BTC is worth $57.07.  So that's about 4.8% in fees.

OP probably would have paid more than 4.8% above spot with PayPal had the transaction completed as intended, .. so in comparing the two methods, an online store/broker like Sendwyre would have been better.    But there likely are other options with better pricing for an online store using debit card.  Cash App, being probably the least cost method.

"If you are looking to Sell bitcoin for fiat money, then the methods available will differ based on a few factors:

- Where are you located (country)?
- How much are you looking to sell?
- What methods of payment will you accept?
- How soon do you need access to the proceeds?
- Is financial privacy important?


You mention Chase, so presumably you are in the U.S.

With P2P trading, payment methods include buyer deposits cash in your bank account, or transfers the funds to your account.  Know that there are risks in being defrauded when using bank transactions for Bitcoin trading, but if your buyer has a long and excellent trust history the risks are much lower.

*P2P Trading Exchanges*

The 10k threshold you hear about a lot is deposits of cash. Paper bills. They trigger a report which is usually automated. Transfer between exchange bank and your bank is not going to be cash.

It does not hurt its reputation but to be treated as it is.

I'm curious as to how he means this.  There have been some blogs suggesting that HK might break their USD peg at some point, but as far as I know these are just bloggers posting ""what if?"" stuff.

The only other ""getting quite sketchy"" issue I've heard of is the potential for China to crack down on protesters/dissidents by freezing/confiscating assets.  I am surprised that I haven't heard of this actually happening on a mass scale yet.

That is the easiest and safest way for a non-programmer to store Bitcoin.

"> and wire it all to a Chinese equivalent to Binance (or whatever works in China) 

Hong Kong banking is not subject to the same restrictions as those in mainland China.  If your friend (or other person trusted by the HK family) has a bank account in the U.S., the owner of the HKD account should be able to just do an international bank wire to the U.S. bank account.  There are details for doing that but the recipient's bank can provide the exact wire instructions that the sender would need.   There is a conversion cost from HKD to USD, and sometimes that's quite expensive (and hard to know the exact amount until the transaction goes through), so looking at bitcoin might still be of interest. . 

If you wanted to know how someone in Hong Kong buys bitcoin, this Bitspark might be something to try:

- https://www.bitspark.io/app  <-- One method to buy BTC with that app is to go to a Cali-Mex restaurant location and insert cash (HKD) into the Cali-Mex Cash Point. 
- https://www.bitspark.io/btc-hkd

Here's more info,... though some may be outdated:

- https://www.bitspark.io/blog-posts/hong-kong-bitcoin-exchange-guide-getting-btc-with-your-hkd 

Having little or no current experience with bitcoin exhanges, they might wish to start out with a small amount first.  Test the process, end-to-end (with bitcoin properly secured).  Then do another transaction with a little larger amount, .. and then when confident, transact the full intended remaining amount.

If this is a large amount of funds, (e.g., $50K USD, or larger), then an [OTC Trading Desk / Broker](https://medium.com/@cointastical/bitcoin-crypto-otc-trading-desks-7f77276c6dc) like [OSL](https://osl.com/en/key-solutions/brokerage) might be the best approach.

Money cannot be moved to bitcoin. Same as it can't be moved to iPhones and umbrellas. Money can be used to *buy* iPhones, umbrellas, or bitcoins. Then you would need to sell bitcoin to someone who wants it to receive fiat for it. That fiat then can be transferred to a bank account. There are quite a few hurdles in the way.

Bitcoin is not anonymous.;1;0;False;jenny82ishere;ff8f1hh;Question;es4xsg;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/es4xsg/question/
"Firstly, ... you needn't harm your financial privacy like you did with your post.   Ask how to buy anonymously or without ID verification or something like that.

Anywhoooo ....

If you are looking to Buy bitcoin with fiat money, then the methods available will differ based on a few factors:

- Where are you located (country)?
- How much are you looking to buy?
- What payment methods do you have available?
- How soon do you need access to the proceeds?
- Is financial privacy important?

You indicated that maintaining financial privacy is important. 

You can purchase online using a No-KYC online store, paying by depositing cash in a bank account or through Moneygram/Western Union:

- [BitQuick QuickBuy](https://www.bitquick.co/quick-buy) [**NO-KYC** (when trx amount is under $400)]

There are physical locations where there are Bitcoin ATMs and other vending/voucher methods.  For example, in the U.S. there is:

- https://coinatmradar.com  <-- Some will require Identity verification/KYC, others just a phone number (e.g., CoinFlip ATMs, when $900 or less), or nothing at all
- https://www.coinstar.com/bitcoin (with [2,200+ locations in the U.S.](https://coinme.com/kiosks))  <-- Identity verification/KYC
- https://libertyx.com/a/buy/locations  <-- Cashier (cash), and/or Kiosk (debit card)
- https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/dabf2m  <-- Some will require identify verification/KYC, but not all will.

Otherwise, an in-person cash trade or an online trade using a P2P trading exchange may possibly be your next best option.  No-KYC payment methods include in-person cash trade, cash deposited in the seller's bank account, cash-in-the-mail, postal money order, and prepaid gift card.  There are sellers on P2P trading exchanges where  these payment methods are accepted:

*P2P Trading exchanges*

- [Person-to-person (P2P) Trading Exchanges](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/dyclf8)
- https://exchangerates.pro  <-- Choose country and/or Payment Method

Using gift cards, there is [CardCoins](https://www.cardcoins.co) for paying with a non-reloadable, prepaid GIFT card (VISA/Mastercard/AMEX/Discover),  [CryptoVoucher.io](https://cryptovoucher.io) for paying with gift cards for numerous brands, [Redeem](https://www.redeeem.com/gift-cards), and [BitOf](https://bitof.io/) for paying with Amazon UK gift cards).   Most of these methods will require identity verification/KYC though. 

First time buyers may like the convenience of an online store that sells bitcoin and accepts debit and/or credit card. I do not know which ones require ID verification/KYC beyond those marked as such. (e.g., [Switchere](https://switchere.com) [**NO-KYC**], [Rebiton](https://rebiton.com) [**NO-KYC**], [Bitsell X](https://bitsellx.com) [[💳](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card)] [**NO-KYC**], [CoinCorner](https://coincorner.com) [[💳](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card)] [**NO-KYC** when £900 or less], [CEX.io](https://CEX.io.com), [Coinify](https://www.coinify.com), [Paybis](https://paybis.com), [Jubiter](https://app.jubiter.com/neworder/buy), [Bittylicious](https://bittylicious.com), [BitIreland](https://bitireland.ie), [Kuna.io Money](https://money.kuna.io), [LiteBit.eu](https://www.litebit.eu/en/buy), [Conio.com](https://conio.com) App, [CryptoVoucher.io](https://cryptovoucher.io), [GetSatoshi.org](https://getsatoshi.org) ([⚡](https://lightningnetworkstores.com/wallets)), [Cash App](https://cash.app/bitcoin) and CoinMama). You can buy BTC on Cash App without ID but you won't be able to withdraw them until you are KYC verified.

"**Credit card**

A credit card is a payment card issued to users (cardholders) to enable the cardholder to pay a merchant for goods and services based on the cardholder's promise to the card issuer to pay them for the amounts plus the other agreed charges. The card issuer (usually a bank) creates a revolving account and grants a line of credit to the cardholder, from which the cardholder can borrow money for payment to a merchant or as a cash advance.

A credit card is different from a charge card, which requires the balance to be repaid in full each month. In contrast, credit cards allow the consumers to build a continuing balance of debt, subject to interest being charged.

"If you are looking to Buy bitcoin with fiat money, then the methods available will differ based on a few factors:

- Where are you located (country)?
- How much are you looking to buy?
- What payment methods do you have available?
- How soon do you need access to the proceeds?
- Is financial privacy important?


You indicated that you would like to maintain your financial privacy (i.e., by not revealing your identity).

Using cash, this is probably your best choice.  You can purchase online using a No-KYC online store, paying by depositing cash in a bank account or through Moneygram/Western Union:

- [BitQuick QuickBuy](https://www.bitquick.co/quick-buy) [**NO-KYC** (when trx amount is under $400)]


There are physical locations where there are Bitcoin ATMs and other vending/voucher methods.  For example, in the U.S. there is:

- https://coinatmradar.com  <-- Some will require Identity verification/KYC, others just a phone number (e.g., CoinFlip ATMs, when $900 or less), or nothing at all
- https://www.coinstar.com/bitcoin (with [2,200+ locations in the U.S.](https://coinme.com/kiosks))  <-- Identity verification/KYC
- https://libertyx.com/a/buy/locations  <-- Cashier (cash), and/or Kiosk (debit card)
- https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/dabf2m  <-- Some will require identify verification/KYC, but not all will.

Otherwise, an in-person cash trade or an online trade using a P2P trading exchange may possibly be your next best option.  No-KYC payment methods include in-person cash trade, cash deposited in the seller's bank account, cash-in-the-mail, postal money order, and prepaid gift card. Some sellers on these P2P exchanges will accept these payment methods.

*P2P Trading exchanges*

- [Person-to-person (P2P) Trading Exchanges](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/dyclf8)
- https://exchangerates.pro  <-- Choose country and/or Payment Method

Using gift cards, there is [CardCoins](https://www.cardcoins.co) for paying with a non-reloadable, prepaid GIFT card (VISA/Mastercard/AMEX/Discover),  [CryptoVoucher.io](https://cryptovoucher.io) for paying with gift cards for numerous brands, [Redeem](https://www.redeeem.com/gift-cards), and [BitOf](https://bitof.io/) for paying with Amazon UK gift cards).   Most of these methods will require identity verification/KYC though. 

First time buyers may like the convenience of an online store that sells bitcoin and accepts debit and/or credit card. I do not know which ones require ID verification/KYC beyond those marked as such. (e.g., [Switchere](https://switchere.com) [**NO-KYC**], [Rebiton](https://rebiton.com) [**NO-KYC**], [Bitsell X](https://bitsellx.com) [[💳](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card)] [**NO-KYC**], [CoinCorner](https://coincorner.com) [[💳](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card)] [**NO-KYC** when £900 or less], [CEX.io](https://CEX.io.com), [Coinify](https://www.coinify.com), [Paybis](https://paybis.com), [Jubiter](https://app.jubiter.com/neworder/buy), [Bittylicious](https://bittylicious.com), [BitIreland](https://bitireland.ie), [Kuna.io Money](https://money.kuna.io), [LiteBit.eu](https://www.litebit.eu/en/buy), [Conio.com](https://conio.com) App, [CryptoVoucher.io](https://cryptovoucher.io), [GetSatoshi.org](https://getsatoshi.org) ([⚡](https://lightningnetworkstores.com/wallets)), [Cash App](https://cash.app/bitcoin) and CoinMama). You can buy BTC on Cash App without ID but you won't be able to withdraw them until you are KYC verified.

"First off, how much do you pay for electricity?

At something like ~$8.5K BTC/USD, the bitcoin miner's equilibrium is about $0.07 per kWh, using an Antminer S9 and today's difficulty level.  This means if you pay more than ~$0.05 per KWh, unplug your ASIC miner and sell it -- it's cheaper to buy bitcoin than operate a bitcoin mining rig.  You are competing against professional miners who earn a decent profit by paying just $0.03 per kWH.

And that equilibrium fluctuates based on difficulty and the exchange rate, so don't count on $0.07 equilibrium lasting.  It could easily drop to $0.05 or much lower even in the next year.  And with [halving](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/cejo72) coming in May, your BTC revenue will drop by nearly half.

"Please stop saying bitcoin is not a good store of value because its volatile. Everything is volatile against the dollar because the dollar itself is not stable, even gold the king of ""store of value"" is volatile! $300 》 $1900 》 $1000 》 $1600 》 $5000?

Store of value is NOT the same as wealth preservation. To store something safely means to always have access to it, not that it will have the same value in the future.

The properties that determine whether something is a good store of value or not are simply that it has no counterparty risk, no default risk, has a liquid global market and is geographically transportable.

Bitcoin is a better store of value than both gold and bonds.

Bitcoin has less counterparty risk if you hold the keys, less default risk as it is not based on debt, it is a more liquid asset than both gold and bonds, it is more transportable, and it exists everywhere the internet exists making it more globally available than both gold and bonds.";4;0;False;slvbtc;ff8oqws;"Ray Dalio on Gold, Bitcoin & ""Cash is Trash"" - Jan 21 2020";es1wkb;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voF7uxAQyqI&feature=share

"The U.S. banking system is basically one giant fraud.

Around ten years ago, I had an account at TCF Bank.  I literally only opened it because my mother fucking forced me to because they were giving away ""free"" $100 gift cards for opening an account there.

I specifically disallowed ACH transactions and overdraft protection on the account when setting it up.  They have checkboxes on the forms they have you sign, asking whether or not to allow these.

I never once used the account for anything.  I only kept it open and made ATM withdrawals personally in order to comply with the waiting period to keep the ""free"" gift card.

Suddenly out of nowhere, an ACH transaction for $35 hit, they honor it, and put my account into overdraft, then start slamming me with fees.

Needless to say, I immediately filed a fraud report and complaint.

After a month, they ""resolve"" it -- but still demand their fees because my account was negative as a result of the ""overdraft protection"" for the ACH that they should have denied for two separate reasons -- because, as I pointed out above, I'd told them not to allow ACH transactions, and because it put my account into overdraft, which they weren't supposed to allow to happen -- any transaction that was going to make the account go negative should have simply been bounced.

The only way an

Then there was the whole ""opening fake accounts"" thing at Wells Fargo.

The system has no security whatsoever, really.  They just play games and steal your money.  None of them go to jail over it.  The regulators don't care.

Also, the euro is probably going to get shredded over the next decade.  Brexit means that the billions Britain is currently forced to pay into the system annually stops.  All those sweet, sweet transfer payments to the poor European countries are going to have to get financed by Germany now, and they're not going to be happy about it.

"> What exchange(s) are best for buying a decent amount of BTC, and eventually cashing out? I would probably look at anywhere from a few hundred USD to 1K.

If you are looking to Buy bitcoin with fiat money, then the methods available will differ based on a few factors:

- Where are you located (country)?
- How much are you looking to buy?
- What payment methods do you have available?
- How soon do you need access to the proceeds?
- Is financial privacy important?

Being a minor, you'll have different options than adults.   You may be limited to No-KYC methods.

First time buyers may like the convenience of an online store that sells bitcoin and accepts debit and/or credit card. I do not know which ones require ID verification/KYC beyond those marked as such. (e.g., [Switchere](https://switchere.com) [**NO-KYC**], [Rebiton](https://rebiton.com) [**NO-KYC**], [Bitsell X](https://bitsellx.com) [[💳](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card)] [**NO-KYC**], [CoinCorner](https://coincorner.com) [[💳](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card)] [**NO-KYC** when £900 or less], [CEX.io](https://CEX.io.com), [Coinify](https://www.coinify.com), [Paybis](https://paybis.com), [Jubiter](https://app.jubiter.com/neworder/buy), [Bittylicious](https://bittylicious.com), [BitIreland](https://bitireland.ie), [Kuna.io Money](https://money.kuna.io), [LiteBit.eu](https://www.litebit.eu/en/buy), [Conio.com](https://conio.com) App, [CryptoVoucher.io](https://cryptovoucher.io), [GetSatoshi.org](https://getsatoshi.org) ([⚡](https://lightningnetworkstores.com/wallets)), [Cash App](https://cash.app/bitcoin) and CoinMama). You can buy BTC on Cash App without ID but you won't be able to withdraw them until you are KYC verified.

You can purchase online using a No-KYC online store, paying by depositing cash in a bank account or through Moneygram/Western Union:

- [BitQuick QuickBuy](https://www.bitquick.co/quick-buy) [**NO-KYC** (when trx amount is under $400)]

There are physical locations where there are Bitcoin ATMs and other vending/voucher methods.  For example, in the U.S. there is:

- https://coinatmradar.com  <-- Some will require Identity verification/KYC, others just a phone number (e.g., CoinFlip ATMs, when $900 or less), or nothing at all
- https://www.coinstar.com/bitcoin (with [2,200+ locations in the U.S.](https://coinme.com/kiosks))  <-- Identity verification/KYC
- https://libertyx.com/a/buy/locations  <-- Cashier (cash), and/or Kiosk (debit card)
- https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/dabf2m  <-- Some will require identify verification/KYC, but not all will.

Otherwise, an in-person cash trade or an online trade using a P2P trading exchange may possibly be your next best option.  The No-KYC payment methods include in-person cash, cash deposited in the seller's bank account, cash-in-the-mail, postal money order, and prepaid gift card.  There are sellers on these P2P exchanges that accept these payment methods:  

*P2P Trading exchanges*

- [Person-to-person (P2P) Trading Exchanges](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/dyclf8)
- https://exchangerates.pro  <-- Choose country and/or Payment Method

Using gift cards, there is [CardCoins](https://www.cardcoins.co) for paying with a non-reloadable, prepaid GIFT card (VISA/Mastercard/AMEX/Discover),  [CryptoVoucher.io](https://cryptovoucher.io) for paying with gift cards for numerous brands, [Redeem](https://www.redeeem.com/gift-cards), and [BitOf](https://bitof.io/) for paying with Amazon UK gift cards).

Here's a useful comparison of exchanges in which you can filter on payment method:

- https://exchangewar.info  <-- Filter box for currency (e.g., EUR) or payment method (e.g., VISA)

">I'm 17 and after working my first job for a while, I want to look into investing into Bitcoin. I have a few questions for the community. I've dealt with BTC before and am fairly familiar with how it works, but this would be my first 'real' venture into it. Thanks for reading in advance!

Take some time to consider why you are investing and what you want. Also take time to budget, pay off debt, save money and how to allocate savings. Without those skills, you will be unable to keep the money you make.


>How much would you recommend investing in relativity to 'total wealth'? I know this isn't an exact question- more personal opinion, but I'd like to at least have a general idea of what's common.

You need to determine your own risk tolerance. Asking this can be a part of that.

I wouldn't recommend to anyone less than 1% because of the upside. I wouldn't recommend more than 10% because of the downside. I am 90%. Expect extreme volatility. You won't understand the emotions involved until you experience it so start small.

>What exchange(s) are best for buying a decent amount of BTC, and eventually cashing out? I would probably look at anywhere from a few hundred USD to 1K. Main thing I'm looking for is low fees- I don't need transactions to be instant or anything.

This changes all the time. My only advice here is keep up to date on exchanges people like on reddit and if people are having issues. I very nearly lost 5% of my coin to Quadriga. Know that unlike regular investment accounts/companies, there is no regulation meaning nothing preventing them from taking your money or ""losing"" it. Minimize exchange exposure and store your own coins.

>Wallets! I know that hardware wallets are the golden standard security-wise, but I would likely be using a virtual wallet short-term. Any recommendations for either are greatly appreciated!

Besides hardware, keep to wallets recommended for your phone (due to sandboxing vs windows/OSX) and keep a paper backup of your seed. Keep multiple because you are more likely to lose the seed than to have it stolen. I am using mycelium but electrum is also a very well-liked wallet.

Additionally, take the time to memorize your seed. Realize this is only one of many backups and many things can go wrong with memorizing but in the unlikely case your city gets nuked while you are on vacation, you will be able to likely eventually remember your seed.

>Any tips or resources for somebody new to the world of BTC investment? Hoping to avoid any common pitfalls or mistakes and learn as much as I can beforehand If/when I do choose to invest, I would of course wait for BTC prices to get over this current boom, but just gathering info at the moment!

"% of wealth: as much as you're comfortable. In my case it's probably 50% of my liquid assets, (I took away the value of the illiquid assets such as the apartment where I live otherwise it would distort everything).

Wallet: you can actually make your own cold storage as long as you know what you're doing. Take an old phone you're not using any longer. Installa a wallet. At this point take the phone offline and NEVER connect it to the Internet again. Open the wallet app and generate QR code . Send your btc there.

"which really sucks - especially if you assume they lend out at a fractional reserve to borrowers which they most certainly do. Banks have to keep 10% available which means they can basically loan out $90 for every $10 they have. My fear is that exchanges play loose for profit so for every bitcoin they have in their wallets they lend out 9 (or more or less.. who knows ?). So basically for every bitcoin you keep on the exchange, someone can borrow 9 and short it against you.  THIS IS ONE BIG REASON WHY YOU SHOULD KEEP COINS OFF EXCHANGES.

I also don't know this for sure but if anyone has better data please correct me.

*edited to add this:

1) You can probably add at least some of Winklevoss and Ver coins (assuming he has some still) to the short reserves as well - I'm not complaining about it.. the lending terms are pretty good so its good income for exchanges.

2) the most interesting thing I see is the growth in non exchange wallets as it is public record.

Checking it by yourself is imo not the most important factor in investing in crypto.

"*sigh* I feel like I need to use really small words with you so you can understand.

If you have money, and that money will grow by next year all on its own, you won't invest it in something that might make you lose it.  Further, you won't invest it in something that will return less than it will grow. This is called ""common sense"" and it's exactly what happened before monetary policy.

As it happens, that causes a shortage of free capital for investment, which in turn causes economic growth to stall.

Great advice: what you consider important or you feel the need to have now, will fade with time and the money you spent for it, may have had better use elsewhere.Iphones are the epitomy of transient value, the one you spend so much money on today, will be irrelevant in a few months.

"Why did you buy Bitcoin in the first place and when? What were your goals?

A lot of responses here are because you didn't mention this, so people are projecting their own goals onto you (mainly as an investment with potential upside of 10x this coming cycle).

I believe I can safely say no one here will think it is ""worth"" selling half your Bitcoin for an iPhone. As to why you want to sell all of it when an iPhone can be had for less than half? Beats me.


>In response to: Don't disclose online how much you have | ""why ? i mean what could the risks be""

Risks include an increase in your reddit account being targeted by people trying to scam you in PMs or hack you via any known passwords tied to your username or through phishing attempts.


You also showed us the app you use. If your username is the same there, that will become a target.

>In response to: Don't spend the money on stupid shit as a teenager, delete this post, move your coins off an exchange, and retire on what you have there. You can always make more cash, but you won't always be able to have that much BTC | dint get that

* Don't spend money as you get it. You want to create good spending habits now. Budget, save and make sure money in is always greater than money out
* This post you created - delete it. He is referring to the security issues presented in the previous answer
* Store your coins yourself, not relying on a third party. The space is not regulated so any third party can steal your coins if they think it is worth risking their business. Start at bitcoin.org and a mobile wallet listed there. Make sure to backup your seed (you'll be prompted during setup) in multiple places. That is to save you in case you lose your ipod.
* In theory, if you wait long enough, bitcoin has enough upside potential that keeping the coin you have will allow or at least contribute substantially to a good retirement.
* The difficulty in making money from a job will go up for you. The ability for you to acquire bitcoin will in theory go down over time

In short, he said don't buy the iPhone and keep the Bitcoin because your future self will regret it. This likely comes from personal experience as many of us here have regretted selling Bitcoin back in the days when it was $10 or $100. We see the upside potential over the next decade to be to 100K or 1M.

>i think but i badly want an iphone

I really hope English is your second language. If not, I feel sorry for you. If it is - then wow! Great job! But a bit difficult to parse. Anyway, I think I get your situation here. You acquired Bitcoin via unrelated methods and do not know much about it and definitely don't value it like many of us do here.

You have two options - cash it out. No one knows what the price will do or when. You could sell now and it could go up to $100K or it could drop to $2000. Asking here doesn't change or shed any real light on what will actually happen. You need to decide this for yourself.

Option 2 - learn more about it and stay invested or partially invested because you truly believe in the upside. If you don't, you are liable to lose money selling out of fear at a bad time.

Option 2 may or may not be for you. It depends on what kind of person you are. Check out bitcoin.org and explore this subreddit more if you are interested.

He received a very harsh sentence where he will never be released from prison.  People who have successfully murdered people have received less time.  He wasn't convicted of attempted murder but the evidence he attempted to have people killed was presented and corroborated.  They obviously didn't need to fabricate evidence to convict him.  That's not even my issue.  My issue is people siding with the conspiracy that he didn't try and have people killed or that he isn't even DPR when we have enough evidence to show it was him.  We have enough evidence to show his intent.  Shit, you have people in these threads claiming he was just some guy who made a website and didn't deal drugs when he was taking a cut of every sale.

This is a common Ulbricht apologist tactic to cite the charges but ignore the fact that the evidence for murder for hire was introduced during his trial and corroborated.

This is a common Ulbricht apologist tactic to cite the charges but ignore the fact that the evidence for murder for hire was introduced during his trial and corroborated.  It was also considered in his sentencing.  The evidence withstood the judicial process and resulted in a guilty verdict.  To deny this is to aid the conspiracies that are not grounded in facts.
  
Another tactic you demonstrated is that apologists like to muddy the waters with the corrupt agentst who had nothing to do with apprehending Ulbricht or handling of the evidence.

What happened to Ross Ulbricht is a huge violation of the constitution, privacy, and basic human decency. He should have never been illegally tapped into by agents, and many falsified statements have been said against him in his jury trial. Among those false statements was that he was part of a murder for hire plot, and a bunch of fabricated lies in order to maximize his punishment. Huge ethical violations have been pointed out towards his case and he has been denied clemency multiple times, been denied a fair retrial, and the justice department wanted to make an example out of him. The only case that is worse than this is what they did to Aaron Swartz. If it wasn't for the libertarian or capitalistic anarchist principles of people like Ross Ulbricht, absolutely NOBODY would know about Bitcoin, and I bet if Satoshi was here, he would agree with a comment like that.

"No where close. Some alts outperformed BTC over a short period of time. But they raised from their ICO price like 50-60,000% over a couple years.

"The video gets some things wrong. But the broad strokes are absolutely correct. Money is created by The Fed and other private banks in the form of loans (and asset purchases in the case of the fed). That isn't controversial. Interest is charged on those loans - also not controversial. 

There are more liabilities than there is existing money to pay it off. Another thing that is uncontroversial and is easily visible by looking at the dollar's [money supply](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MZM) and comparing it to the [total US debt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_position_of_the_United_States#/media/File:Consumer_and_Government_debt_in_the_United_States.png) - about $17 trillion dollars of MZM money supply (which is the upper limit on actual created money) vs almost $40 trillion of consumer and government debt.

And the fact that monetary inflation steals purchasing power is also uncontroversial. No one is claiming that creating money doesn't cause long term price inflation. 

So what exactly are you saying is ""simplistic and economically illiterate"" or ""outright false""? A couple small inaccurate points or misquotes?

Are you really going to tell me that creating more loans than can be paid back is good for the economy?

"Really? You have to ask me that? Let's make this simple.

Let's say 2 people start farms. Both people only  have $10,000 to their name and spend it all working on their farm over the course of a year. One person creates $20,000 worth of produce. The other person is more skilled, uses better technology, or chooses better crops, etc, and makes $50,000 worth of produce.

Both people are more wealthy than they were the previous year, but one person is more wealthy than the other. Inequality has grown, but both people are more wealthy. That's why it makes sense, in my head and otherwise.

Inequality does not mean the same thing as some people getting poorer.

"No problems, happy to help a fellow teen!

I personally don't hold that much so it's not worth buying a hardware wallet for but if I did I'd definitely invest in one.

*****
When I say your 'own wallet' it basically means you control it.

Imagine there is a safe and there is a key to the safe. When using coinbase as a wallet, they have the key to their safe and you have to trust them to give you access to it whenever you want.

But, when you use your own wallet, the safe belongs to you and only you have the key to unlock it. So if the exchange gets hacked and lose all their keys to the attackers, your coins aren't in those safes so you won't lost anything.

Coinbase does seem to be pretty safe regarding this but it's still good practice to use your own wallet.

For now, you may want to continue using Coinbase but if your holdings grow to be quite sizeable consider using your own wallet and then after that, maybe a hardware wallet if it grows so big.

*****

It's probably not that recommended but I just use Coinomi on my mobile phone as my main wallet (again, I don't hold that much crypto). I have the seed phrase written down physically and stored securely in a few different places too. I wouldn't store it anywhere like a notes app (Google keep etc) just in case. For a Bitcoin wallet, I'd recommend Electrum on desktop as well and do the same thing with the seed phrase.

*****

For transferring out of Coinbase, go to pro.coinbase.com and log in with the same details (there may be extra verification steps), and then go to the Portfolio page, choose Bitcoin and then deposit and choose from Coinbase. (This doesn't take any fees but moves from Coinbase to Coinbase Pro)

Once that's done, go to your wallet and find the ""Receive"" part and you get an address. This is kinda like an account number of a normal bank, but longer and case sensitive (so copy and paste and never type manually).

Copy that address and in Coinbase Pro, go to Portfolio > Bitcoin > Withdraw and paste your address, making sure it's correct (I generally check first and last few characters - including upper and lower case) and then confirm.

It will then be on its way to your wallet!

*****

By the way, most modern wallets (the ones mentioned above) will generate a new address for every transaction so the next time you go to receive, it will be a new address but you can use old ones too (usually you can see previous addresses as well).

"This is good advice. To add to it: don't worry if you miss the crypto wave. Put a little in and have fun. Pay attention to all types of investments as you grow up. Something will come up, every decade and generation has multiple ""gold rushes"" of one type or another. Generally, keep you eyes open for opportunities and never put all your eggs in one basket. Spread your investments. Invest early and often.

"That’s cause this is a bitcoin subreddit. It really depends who your ask. For me, I see a lot more potential in ETH. Take what I say with a grain of salt cause I could be terribly wrong, but so can everyone else in this sub.

It’s programmable money, which widens the use cases when it comes to DeFi. There’s many things that you can currently do with your ETH:

-take out a collateralized loan

-supply liquidity for trading fees

-earn interest through lending

-earn interest through DAI

-tokenize in-game assets so that they are fungible and tradable on an open market. Imagine people making money by gaming and selling skins they earn to make a living

-access decentralized VPNs

ETH is becoming an alternative tool for finance. Most banks in my area offer 1% interest on their savings, I could easily take that money convert it to ETH, convert the ETH to DAI, and start earning 6% interest on my savings (with some risk of MakerDAO collapsing of course, but at that point I can get decentralized insurance to cover myself in case it does). Ethereum will provide opportunities to come up with use cases that no one has ever imagined. Imagine traditional assets on ethereum. I could get collateral for my Apple stocks without even selling them. I could supply liquidity to exchanges trading Apple to make money. No one knows what’s in store for eth and if any of it will be useful but I’m investing in the opportunity for those new revolutionary ideas to emerge.

The real question is what can you do with BTC and the answer is speculate on it. People like to say to use it to transfer value but that’s a very small portion of what people actually do with BTC. I don’t even need BTC to speculate on BTC, I can use ETH and convert it to sBTC to get BTC price exposure, I can go on fulcrum and open a 2x long BTC position. I’ve used BTC a couple of times to buy a service online, but that was years ago. Now all these services accept a whole range of crypto’s, and I sure as hell won’t be using the slowest/most expensive option.

Bitcoin showed us the way, ETH will show us the future.";2;0;False;enough4all4ever;ff7ewrl;15 y/o ,Just invested 75$ in btc for first time ever and plan to do more! Anything i should be expecting on this rollercoaster?;ervekp;https://i.redd.it/93q3r79y65c41.jpg

"Ya everyone is confused by taxes, including me so i’m just going off things I’ve heard multiple times.

In that case as long as you waited past a year all those purchases would be under the same percentage of capital gains tax so that part would be easy, but calculating how much you need to be taxed on for each purchase might be harder. But if it’s only like 20-30 purchases it’s not that big of a deal. If it’s more you could even use a program. The issue comes when you are trading back and forth and many purchases. That’s when things get to where it’s impossible to calculate.

I’d say don’t worry too much about it. Just try to keep it simple by not trading a whole lot is my advice.";1;1;False;MattPilkerson;ff7ottv;15 y/o ,Just invested 75$ in btc for first time ever and plan to do more!

"dollar cost average

tell yourself ""im going to buy $100 worth of bitcoin each day/week/month"" and then actually stick with it. 

the idea is that you buy no matter the price and get a nice average price which reduces your risk vs. trying to time the market

I’ll give you that BTC is the most secure but is it the best currency? Are any cryptos a good currency? No, no one wants to spend money that will be more valuable in the future.

That's very, very true. Make high-risk stuff like 10% of your portfolio. I know you're only 15, so having a portfolio might be way down the list of priorities. I went too hard into crypto and basically watched my money sit still, or go to zero, for two years. If I had put 80% of that money in smarter investments it would have outpaced  crypto.

-What did you do with the Trezor when you left the hotel room? Did you leave it in the hotel room?
- How about your laptop? Did you leave it in the hotel room where anyone could access it? Could someone have installed RAT (remote access) program on your laptop so they could see what you were doing and maybe get the Trezor PIN?

"You can't easily flash a fake bootloader, if the Trezor (One) was updated to firmware 1.8.x or higher.  For Trezor T you can only flash signed bootloaders.

In principle you can use the wallet.fail method to boot the processor with reduced read-out protection and then flash a new firmware via the JTAG connector.  However, this would require opening the case.  So, in that case you could also build your own malicious Trezor clone and put it into an official looking case.

"I assume this JTAG connector attack will work with both the Model ONE and Model T. Correct? 

So, let's go with this logic. You leave your Trezor in a hotel safe and you come back to use it again and you find that it has somehow 'wiped' itself. I know that if your device has been replaced with a fake one that has altered firmware then maybe if you use it to create a new wallet seed then it might be generating a weak entropy seed that can be guessed by the attacker. 

However, what if you use that device to 'recover' your old wallet seed. What is the attack method now? If you use a passphrase and you enter that on the device (eg. Model T), could the fake firmware actually record the passphrase so that if they steal it AGAIN they can now read your passphrase? That would be a really ingenious attack !!

Would a solution to this problem be that if you find your device has somehow 'wiped' itself then you should always go to the official Trezor webwallet and re-flash your device with 'official' firmware?

I thought about this but not possible. and when you think of how you put in the pin, its always that the background of the trezor device is shown to the laptop and even then you only have digits market as stars in the field for the pin. and with this you cant get the private keys anyway which they needed to copy the adresses into their wallets to make this kind of withdraw happen, is my guess.

"Peter Schiff will never again be credible in any future Bitcoin debate, because we unforcedly outed himself as somebody who spoke and debated about Bitcoin for years whilst not even understanding the most basic fundamentals of it.

I knew Peter is not the brightest. But that he is THAT naive and unknowledgable surprised even me - he has not even learned the most basic 101 of Bitcoin in YEARS.

But what is even worse: After having made this most embarrassing mistake, instead of keeping it silently for himself, he decided to tell it to the world, saying, no shouting: ""Hello world, I just wanted to let you all know just HOW stupid I really am!!!""

Poor poor Peter. Not because of his lost coins. But because of his completely an irrecoverably lost (because self-destroyed) reputation.

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is a fork of Bitcoin, splitting off of the main chain in August 2017 just prior to the Segregated Witness soft fork, and raising the block-size data cap from 1 MB to 8 MT, making on-chain tx very cheap (at least for the near future). Sending a BCH tx costs less than 1 cent. However BTC fees are very low now too (typically only 0.00002 BTC so relatively inexpensive).  The market clearly recognizes BTC as Bitcoin and values it more than 30x higher than BCH.;3;0;False;sph44;ff83wro;Daily Discussion, January 21, 2020;err0ss;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/err0ss/daily_discussion_january_21_2020/

I'm in the latter camp, myself.  Before when I was homeless I had no Bitcoin, and I was stressed out all the time.  Now that I'm homeless and have Bitcoin, I am a lot more chill.  (Though living in a society that doesn't at all seem to protect my right to be a human, who has basic physical needs, including warmth and water and the freedom to pee and poop and such, is still stressful as hell.)";1;1;False;Turil;ffa4ama;Who else lives like me?;erj4ff;https://i.redd.it/5uyptx82uzb41.jpg
Having the freedom to do whatever work I want, with no job getting in the way, and not having to take care of my husband (physically), and being homeless, for over a decade for the most part, while having Bitcoin, has indeed improved my life immensely.  I went from being depressed (because my husband was pretending he's not married to me, and had moved out, leaving me homeless, because no job wanted to pay me money to pay rent) to being super passionate about my life, doing important work that no one wants to pay for, but needs to be done and is inherently rewarding.;1;0;False;Turil;ff9x3f5;Who else lives like me?;erj4ff;https://i.redd.it/5uyptx82uzb41.jpg

"How to get that is exactly a new constitution. Better representation gives people the power to choose more reasonable options. When you live in a country where power comes from might (ie fake democracies that are actually dictatorships, like Venezuela) you don't have much political choice. A constitution that prevents dictators from keeping the country under a stranglehold is the solution. 

How to get to that point is usually by the rich elite coming together to create better rules for government. The poor just have to get lucky that the stars align in such a way as to cause the elites to be in a position to create a better government. If we had an [international government](https://governology.wordpress.com/2017/03/11/an-international-federation-part-1/) that had the power to create basic protections against rulers, this would be far easier.";2;0;False;fresheneesz;ff7x4qh;Last week 614 BTC were traded using LocalBitcoin in a country where minimum wage is 5 USD per month.
