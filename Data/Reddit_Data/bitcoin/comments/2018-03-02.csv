"Cryptocurrency is basically cash. If a rich person had all or most of his funds as cash in his mattress and it was known to friends of friends, yes, very high risk. And cryptocurrency is now well known enough to the general public that a non-trivial number of people understand it's cash-like.

An ATM has withdrawal limits, automated fraud detection and cameras. Cash does not have any of these features, and neither does cryptocurrency.

Now you might argue that you could secure your funds, maybe in a way that it would be difficult or impossible for you to access all of it in a robbery. Maybe ""better"" than the aforementioned ATM protections, and let everyone know too. That wouldn't decrease your risk though; just the idea that you keep cash in the mattress is enough to land you in trouble, and that trouble may not be informed enough to understand your self-imposed ""security"" limitations. And maybe they're not the type to leave witnesses.

This is all in addition to the social problems coming from people thinking you have money, which is almost always bad news. If you ever come into money, it's extremely ill advised to let friends and family know. It often changes the dynamic of a non-trivial number of those relationships suddenly and without warning.

All that said, those are probably some nice problems to have.

You're doing it right now, using ad hominem to discredit my point because I happen to disagree with you on something completely irrelevant to the topic we're discussing.

There is absolutely a reason we need Male Rights Advocacy. I don't see anyone fighting for gender equity in the world's suicide rate, for example. Males very disproportionately succeed in ending their lives. They very disproportionately fail in getting custody of their children. But all we care about is how much money women are making, when these other issues could potentially do far more harm than us making more money. Which can also be accounted for by the fact that statistically, men work far more dangerous jobs and take less time for parental leave.

Now, MGTOW is just a bunch of guys who feel that they've been so hurt and fucked over by women that they decide not to be involved with them romantically anymore.

What does that have to do with the claim that ""women are not discriminated against"", or the stronger one that ""women enjoy a 2:1 hiring preference""? Don't be so defensive man, I'm not asserting that discrimination does or does not occur, I'm asking you what VCs' *opinion* is on whether it occurs. (And as a corollary, why their opinion is relevant.)

>>In 2013, money for startups was overwhelmingly going to male founders.

Yeah, and that still doesn't prove that the cause is *discrimination*. And startups getting funded is not a matter of ""hiring"", it's a matter of *investment*. To disprove the claim that women enjoy a 2:1 hiring preference you'd have to do something like zoom into those companies that VCs invest in (male or female founders alike) and look at their hiring practices. And then you'd have to ask VCs whether they're aware of what you find.

>>86.5% were men. 13.5% were women.

Stats like these are wholly specious without reference to stats about the gender breakdown of people who *attempt* to raise capital for their startups. And stats about who even attempts a startup in the first place. And 86.5/13.5 split in *funding* could turn out to confirm a preference for women if pre-funding startups themselves were split 95/5. I don't know what the actual numbers are, but I would be surprised at neither 95/5 nor 75/25. (I would be surprised at 25/75. What would you be surprised by?)";2;1;False;bpj1805;dv2cxyq;"""The barriers to entry for tech are very low compared to any other professional field.

"You are on the right track. Change is hard and takes a lot of work. It might take years but you will get there. My only other suggestions are get to the doctor and get some bloodwork done and make sure you are 100% healthy and exercise daily. Learning to exercise has changed my life more than any other thing. I used to be depressed, smoke too much weed, and used to game too much. Learning to exercise helped me with impulse control and the chemicals it release make me feel much more like a normal person (Also doing activities is a good way to meet cool people and gives you self reliance. It is pretty awesome to go on a hike and get back knowing you got yourself through it.) Also if your therapist supports it maybe consider getting away from your family. It sounds like they might be hindering your progress. It doesn't sound like a great environment. You don't have to cut off contact but maybe a new town and a new job might help or just moving out if you live with them.

">Is the fact that women are killed by men 10:1 proof that women are discriminated against?

What exactly do you mean by ""10:1"" here? The majority of victims of violent crimes are men, not women, so it can't be that. But I don't see how a 10:1 ratio in perpetrators of violent crimes points to *discrimination*.

So no, whatever it is you mean by ""10:1"", I'm pretty sure I don't consider it ""proof that women are discriminated against"". Discrimination is not the only possible cause of differences.

>Or could it be that men are more, on average, able to dish out discrimination and violence?

Violence isn't a factor in VC funding of startups, or in workplace deaths of loggers and fishermen. With violence out of the picture, in what way(s) are men ""more able to dish out discrimination"" in the world of VC finance, logging or fishing operations?

A greater risk-tolerance among men explains (at least in part) their greater representation on the ""startup scene"", fishing and logging crews, and cryptocurrency communities. Their greater capacity for unaided violence (i.e. without weapons) does not explain these phenomena. As for a putative greater capacity to dish out discrimination: well I just gotta say - citation needed.";1;1;False;bpj1805;dv2lsc1;"""The barriers to entry for tech are very low compared to any other professional field.

">>Yeah, and that still doesn't prove that the cause is discrimination.

>Sure it does.

Is the fact that the vast majority of workplace deaths are men proof that men are discriminated against? No, it isn't proof of that. Discrimination is only one of many possible factors that could explain phenomena like a significant imbalance in the founding of startups, their funding, or workplace deaths. And just because it's a possible factor doesn't mean that it is a factor in a particular instance, so the 86.5/13.5 split is not ""proof"". At best it's a prompt to *dig deeper*, perhaps in a search for proof of discrimination.
