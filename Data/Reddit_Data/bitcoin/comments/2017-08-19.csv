">IMO, the inconveniences of bitcoin completely outweigh the harm that can be caused by a central bank or the federal reserve.

If I understand correctly the main point you're making, I think you put this part backwards...maybe put it like this:

Indeed. This is why I shouldn't reddit so early in the morning.;2;0;False;eitauisunity;dluqxym;Me in 60 years;6ttbe2;https://i.redd.it/4p4r1q4zqvfz.jpg
Look into stablecoins. Personally I think things like that will be more commonly used for everyday purchases. Several are being developed as tokens on the Ethereum chain, such as Digix and Dai.;1;0;False;Mortos3;dlugmmk;Me in 60 years;6ttbe2;https://i.redd.it/4p4r1q4zqvfz.jpg

The real Satoshi literally sold this to you dude. Were you wearing a Bitcoiner shirt like the HODL definition shirt? Totally slipped it in the bottom in a paper wallet, if you used it you fried it.

Also what I was thinking! THEY'RE INSIDE OF THE TOASTER!  (Like Zoolander). Break that shit open and see what you find hahaha if they paid 3000BTC for the toaster then there's no point in not breaking it open to find out since you would already own it at a cost of 3000btc or 0 btc, but if there's a chance that they hid 3000 btc inside then you might just want to say fuck it and take the sucker apart to confirm or deny the findings for yourself. Anything etched (key or passphrase) in the metal on the bottom plate or inside on the flat walls or flat metal surfaces of the housing? I'd smoke a bunch of weed and go Munich on that toaster, search it like its a fucking toy maker's bomb.;3;0;False;3rdiJedi;dlu37ka;Found this at a yard sale!!!;6ua7jq;https://i.redd.it/neze6r6z2bgz.jpg

I feed bears cocaine laced meat (i'm talking kilograms of cocaine / feeding), they're my mine's security. Best not piss them off. Then I got Neo and Lawnmower man chilling on my firewall going tag team on any would be penetrators with dual HK MP5Ks & an HK MG6 respectively in digital terms. Thank god it's only in the digital realm or that could be a police PR nightmare scene if they were to try and raid my op lmfao But as a all hell apocalypse fail safe, we run a Megawatt electro magnet behind our servers, perpetually forever in standby. Until SHTF and we wipe everything like a fucking Harry Houdini Black OPs Ninja on DMT with Billy fucking Mayes' Ghost all with the flip of switch!;1;1;False;3rdiJedi;dlu3efj;Found this at a yard sale!!!;6ua7jq;https://i.redd.it/neze6r6z2bgz.jpg
