"I found the Economist the best paper I've read.  They aren't without bias, but usually at least present alternative views and then come down on the side they prefer.   They also don't always support the same political party, and generally when they've written about something I know a bit about (when most newspapers suddenly seem ridiculous), they've come across as fair & balanced.

This is all just my opinion, but they seem pretty balanced & fair.

So, as you said, they are pissed that they weren't invited to the party as a half-assed revelation with questionable supporting evidence is right up their alley.

"Its completely true, I'm not referring to a debtors prison.. 

I didn't say that unemployed people are thrown in Jail.. I said that if you refuse to pay your council tax you are thrown in Jail and that is correct.

Yes its true that you can 'apply' for a council tax benefit payment for periods of unemployment, but in order to be granted a council tax benefit payment you first have to bend over to pick up the 'application form' and then you have to comply with certain orders with regard to work. Specifically you have to sign a contract to say that you will follow the directives of the Dept for Work and Pensions with regard to job hunting activities and then follow through with those directives and report back bi-weekly to have your compliance signed off on.
 
Its the same either way, just a different work... Either way you are forced to work and forced to hand over them majority of the benefits of that work.

"This is simply untrue.  What you're referring to is a ""debtor's prison.""  Such prisons (where someone is put in jail for being unable to pay a debt, whether tax or otherwise) is illegal throughout the developed world.  There are many unemployed people in England and the US, and they are not put in jail for being unemployed.

Perhaps what you're referring to are taxes on unemployment benefits?  Surely you see the difference.  If someone is unemployed and not working at all, the government may indeed give them a free 10,000 pounds and then demand 20% of it back in taxes.  And indeed, if you refuse to give back 20% of what you just received, they may put you in jail.";1;1;False;errydaymf0;d2rkbv4;"WikiLeaks on Twitter: ""We'd like to thank #Satoshi hoaxer Dr Craig Wright for showing how bankrupt the fact-checking standards are at the BBC, LRB & Economist.""";4hozs5;https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/727562945840975872

That's not slavery.  As human beings we need food and shelter.  A free man is free to pursue food and shelter however he wishes.  He can go to work for one of the many thousands of employers, start his own business, engage in barter, etc.  Under any political or economic system, *everyone* needs food and shelter, and must find some way to procure it.  If people are free, they can procure it however they wish.  If they are slaves, they are obligated to procure it by working for one particular employer.;6;2;False;errydaymf0;d2rkg9w;"WikiLeaks on Twitter: ""We'd like to thank #Satoshi hoaxer Dr Craig Wright for showing how bankrupt the fact-checking standards are at the BBC, LRB & Economist.""";4hozs5;https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/727562945840975872

"You speak to the 'wage' portion of the phrase only. In an anarchist fantasy world we could give up the 'profession' to live solely on what food, accommodation and medicine we can gather from what nature has provided (like every other living inhabitant of this abundant planet). We could also stop being forced to labour for the payment of 'taxes' without fear of being thrown in jail and having our homes stolen.

In England there is a 'council tax', Its about a tenth of a typical months income for low earners and if you outright refuse to pay it, they jail you quite quickly. They only accept UK pounds in payment. If you do earn UK pounds you have to pay around 20-45% in Income Tax and the vast majority of the remainder is subject to VAT at 17.5% when you spend it.

So in England, and I'm sure the same is true in most places, You are both forced to work and forced to give over the vast majority of the fruits of your labour to the government in taxes.

"I didn't realise that - it makes it even more probable that Wright is Satoshi. Because Satoshi posted this just before he disappeared:

"Yea the Economist did a good job qualifying their articles:

The BBC on the other hand did a terrible job. I still agree with wikileaks because there has been evidence a of hoax since December and The Economist should've picked up on, but on the other hand, they probably got a lot of ad revenue from this whole thing...

"Let's be real though, there's no way they had someone in-house with enough technical expertise to debunk him or really even understand what's going on. Debunking him would require hiring some sort of bitcoin/cryptographic expert as a consultant, and even then how would they even be able to determine who is actually qualified to do the job? They don't have enough in-house technical expertise to do that either, and it would be pretty expensive to hire anybody good.

Only the Economist really even cares about Bitcoin and they never outright said ""This is it, this is SN"". 

In this case it would just be way too damn expensive and difficult for news agencies to really fact check this. There's not enough money in simply reporting on news in the world of bitcoin to justify sinking, what, tens of thousands of dollars (ok, maybe not that much) on fact-checking that they don't even know will be effective? You could argue that means they have no business on reporting this in the first place, but what do they really lose by having to go back on their reporting?
