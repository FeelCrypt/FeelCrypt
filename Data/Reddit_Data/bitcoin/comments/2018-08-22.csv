No, not wholly. Huawei, for example, is a state run multinational corporation. There might be a need for equity profiting. Or, there might be a need for some set of parties in a complex economy to have some sort of property or privacy rights. (Trade secrets, for example.)

"Look, at this point, you're just arguing for what you personally would like. You're not talking about what's actually in evidence, you're arguing from your personal ideology. There are many ways for things to work and you don't need pure capitalism, extensive privacy, and personal property rights to do this. 

Hey! Those are my values too. But, it turns out that these values aren't the only way to get things done. They are beliefs and theory rather than principles support by evidence and facts. The actual evidence strongly suggests that we don't really need them maximized in order to make things work.

> ""Pride of ownership"" -- who mentioned that?

I was using that as a shorthand for personal property rights and privacy. Sorry if that confused you.

>Errr, right...... I want to own my stuff. I want to be responsible for the good and the bad.

That's you! Not everyone is just like you. Some people don't. And, some people would say that the place your coming from is excessively greedy, selfish, and socially irresponsible. We can only determine this stuff from what's in evidence as working. And, it turns out, what you'd like isn't the only way to do things, nor are your principles the backbone of  how this world actually works.

"Hello,

Firstly, I am sorry that you had a less than positive trading experience and I apologize for the communication problems with support - we have contacted you directly through your ticket with more detailed info on your case.

When a trade is started, Bitcoin are kept in LocalBitcoinsâ€™ custody (escrow) until the trade is completed. By our Terms of Service, if Bitcoins are held in escrow, LocalBitcoins has the legal means and processes to transfer the funds to either the buyer or the seller, and there is no need to create support tickets.

Cases that fall outside of that category - when the BTC is no longer in trade escrow - can be legally very complex as some processes involve 3rd parties and BTC ownership becomes unclear. Such cases cannot be simply resolved by us without the help from officials.

LocalBitcoins.com is always willing to collaborate with the law enforcement agencies, but an investigation can be interrupted for reasons that are beyond LocalBitcoinsâ€™ scope.

We sincerely hope that your issue will be soon resolved and we are available to provide all the assistance within our reach.";4;1;False;Vera_LocalBitcoins;e4mgdtv;"Localbitcoins.com is illegally holding my 9.3 bitcoin on ""escrow"" since may 2015";98uecl;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/98uecl/localbitcoinscom_is_illegally_holding_my_93/

Because you're motivated to by whatever reason. People invent things they don't own all the time. This happens in private companies a whole lot. And, there's a range of compensation in the public and private sector for those sorts of achievements.

"What the fuck?

So if the bank steals your money, it's your fault because you handed them the money?

Good. More fun for me. At the very least I hope you understand the significance of those dates.;1;1;False;Cthulhooo;e4mywhd;"Localbitcoins.com is illegally holding my 9.3 bitcoin on ""escrow"" since may 2015";98uecl;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/98uecl/localbitcoinscom_is_illegally_holding_my_93/
Hi Ray. If you have contact with Nikolaus or Jeremias, perhaps you could advise them how your company legally seize bitcoins from scammers and return to the victims. It seems LBC are unsure or unable to legally proceed and so the case has stalled for some time.;1;0;False;mistaliveuk;e4mk7vl;"Localbitcoins.com is illegally holding my 9.3 bitcoin on ""escrow"" since may 2015";98uecl;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/98uecl/localbitcoinscom_is_illegally_holding_my_93/

Have you gotten any progress with this yet dude?  I'd love to see you get your coins back. I don't understand where they will come from though, like me, doesn't the person who scammed you have them now?  If that's the case, I don't see LBC taking the loss on 9 bitcoins because this guy did this too you and the govn hates bitcoin so much I don't think you will get any help there either.  The police force sure isn't going to waste their time on this investigation.  The bank has a fraud department for this and they have made their decision already. ;1;1;False;Binsmokin420;e4mcozj;"Localbitcoins.com is illegally holding my 9.3 bitcoin on ""escrow"" since may 2015";98uecl;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/98uecl/localbitcoinscom_is_illegally_holding_my_93/
">  can freeze people's account, garnish it, seize it. You CANNOT do that to crypto.

You can't do that with cash. If someone scams you they don't just leave the money sitting in an account waiting for it to be seized.

> In what universe do you think a government can order or enforce the return of crypto?

They can make the same findings they make anywhere else and their reach is no more or less. In a scam the money still isn't sitting in a bank account they can access.

> In most countries Bitcoin might as well be a sword on your WoW character, there is not a system of laws around it.

These are civil cases.";1;1;False;BitAlt;e4lko5h;"Localbitcoins.com is illegally holding my 9.3 bitcoin on ""escrow"" since may 2015";98uecl;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/98uecl/localbitcoinscom_is_illegally_holding_my_93/
