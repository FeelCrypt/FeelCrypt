"> Yes a reasonable company would avoid investing in adding bitcoin acceptance as it's not worth the effort due to demand

You shifted your argument from ""no reasonable company will accept [Bitcoin]"" to ""there is limited demand for merchants to accept Bitcoin at this time"". I assume that is because I demonstrated that ""reasonable"" companies are in fact accepting Bitcoin, but you didn't want to acknowledge that. I made no argument about the actual number of transactions to these merchants nor about whether new merchants will accept it in the near future. Please avoid trying to change the topic in the future.

> Average Transaction time 7 day moving average

You used average rather than median again. All of the transactions with a 0 or 1 satoshi fee greatly distort that graph. If you pay the fee suggested by a wallet, you will with high probability confirm in one block.

> Average Transaction fees medium = $1.5+

I'll admit that is higher than I thought it was considering the highest fee I've paid in the last few months was $0.40, and I've never had to wait for a second block to get my first confirmation.

> Bitcoin however has undergone multiple contentious hard forks devaluing the network.

Forks of Bitcoin don't in general devalue Bitcoin any more than a new altcoin devalues Bitcoin or a new government currency devalues the USD. The exceptions to this are if the fork causes miners to switch to the new fork.

>> Bitcoin is different things at different stages of its development

> That isn't a winning model, bitcoin should have a clear goal or intention from the start. 

Gold didn't need that in order to succeed. New uses emerged over the course of its history. But Bitcoin has had clear primary goals from the start. That is a separate from whether all of the technology to accomplish those goals fully exists yet. Just as the coin that you are attempting to pump, Ethereum, doesn't have proof of stake yet, Bitcoin doesn't have lightning networks. I don't hold the present lack of PoS against Ethereum, so why do you hold the current lack of LN against Bitcoin? You seem to have a double standard. Innovation doesn't happen over night, and it's unreasonable to expect it to. Having bumps on the road is not the same as ""bitcoin [being] a unusable mess"".

"I completely understand has definitely improved. I think part of the problem lies in the fact that for it being easily accessible. Such as, bank debit card for instance, for retailers to accept this ""new"" 3rd party anonymous currency that fluctuates almost like a stock market. Which some, but a few, have accepted as a form of payment, obviously the early birds were smart if they hung on to them. 

All I'm saying is I think its much more complicated than an Amazon, Netflix or Email for anyone to say its going to put banks out of business. That's like saying telephones killed the post office, which It likely hurt them a bit. However, I believe there's a place for everything and one day bitcoin will find its place and everything will balance accordingly around that over the span of time. Video after all didn't kill the radio star, I can't remember the last time I watched a music video unless I was intentionally looking for it. People want the music, not the flair (Spotify, Pandora, XMRadio, Youtube playlists, SoundCloud, etc). Those that want that experience, it still has its niche and it's still around and has success (not sure if its a fitting analogy, but whatever 2AM).

Will bitcoin one day perhaps be the global currency? Who knows, time will tell! It's definitely an interesting talking point either way. Just imagine your employer paying you in bitcoin, its anonymous, how will taxes work? The government would have to some how be involved, therefore, linking your identity to how many bits you've earned...to say they'd simply ""trust you"" to pay what you owe is a stretch. Then it just becomes just another typical currency, negating the whole point of the entire structure of why it was brought about. Another thought, if the market is good in the beginning of the year...then late year, the market tanks...does the government owe you what the bits were worth before they tanked (screwing them) or after (screwing you). Will they calculate the fluctuation over the course of time for 300+ million people in the US currently? Definitely gets in some shady areas that will cost the government more ""bits"" to deal with. At this point I believe I'm thinking about it too much lol.

Honestly, I don't know much about the entirety of something as complicated as this. That said, there's definitely tons of things to consider about cryptocurrency.

>Bitcoin doesn't need to be divided into '20 different coins' it's a single additional payment layer. I'm not going to explain it, maybe you can do some of this 'research' you speak of. 

Bitcoin has split twice this year and each time the people doing the splitting have made money off it, there's incentive to keep splitting the coin and selling off the new coins to some idiot who can't tell the difference. 

The blockchain is a great technology but there's so much bitcoin can't do that traditional banks and remitters can.

Banks in the UK do instant inter-bank transfers when it's between accounts that send to each other. The reason they normally delay the funds is to give you a chance to cancel the request since when something has been paid you legally can't get the money back unless the person on the other side consents. Ugh there's a reason we use banks, they help with lots of things like buying houses and keeping our money safe and protecting us with insurance.

I agree Ripple was just an example. They all want to be in control of their coin and get a cut if smaller banks want to join.

It sounds like a joke if I told you that 95% of companies don't hire you if you don't have the ""NIE"" (basically a national number for non spanish) and they also require you a Spanish Bank account in your name. You go get the NIE and you can only get a 3 months one because the definitive one needs a work contract to get. You go to the same company that asked you for the NIE, and nop, you need the definitive one which you can't get without a contract first. You then try to open the bank account, same thing. Need the definitive NIE. Spent 6 months trying to get a contract from someone that would hire me with the 3 months NIE until I gave up and decided to go to the UK instead.
