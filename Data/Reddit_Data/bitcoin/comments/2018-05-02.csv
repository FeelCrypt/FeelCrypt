"Absolutely. They don't really threaten the banking industry in any meaningful way 

High fees, if anything, are *good* for the banking system. It helps banks make more money. And fractional reserve banking is amazing for them. A government prints money... Diluting the value of the currency, but essentially hands 100% of that ""extra"" wealth back to the bank's so they can invest, and profit. The bank's don't suffer the effects of the inevitable inflation, because they recover their associated losses by increasing interest rates accordingly. The demand for finance is so high that people will, if necessary pay APRs in excess of a 1000%. So the system..  actually thrives on what you describe.

"Yeah a few things were causing the high fees:

1. Lots of transactions going back and forth when the price is going crazy.
2. Segwit hadn't been added.
3. Coinbase wasn't batching transactions.

The last one was almost undeniably (personal opinion: was undeniably) the cause. Of course there's something to be said for a single exchange being able to clog the network like that but it was also just bad business unless they were getting kickbacks from the miners somehow.

Anyway, on top of all of this LN is looking very promising for ""cup of coffee"" purchases and will be faster and cheaper. So yeah, things are going well. :D

"> fractional reserve banking

Now that's a really good point. I haven't thought about it too hard, but off the top of my head, I do know it's possible to set up a smart contracts/DAO with it's own native currency. With this native currency, they could create out of thin air a theoretically infinite amount of tokens. And just like in fractional reserve banking, they can set the limit to some multiple of of how much ""real"" money(like BTC or ETH) is in the smart contract. So if people invest 100 ETH into the DAO, then the DAO could be programmed to lend out a max of 200 ETH equivalent or whatever. MakerDai does something similar, but they used this technique to create a stable coin that's pegged to USD.

"The only time bitcoin would be more convenient for me would be sending money internationally to an individual(not a business, because they accept my card 99% of the time) I'm not sure why you mention going to an Atm to get cash... I haven't used cash in years because it's outdated. I can send money instantly to anybody in my country that has a phone number or email address. I can shop both online and at brick and mortar stores with ease. Bitcoin is less convenient for all of these scenarios. It's slower and not accepted anywhere that I would spend it. Converting some of my bitcoin to fiat that I could spend was either very slow or expensive.

I'm not saying that bitcoin has no future, or anything along those lines. but in its current form it has very little use for the average person. It needs to be improved first.
