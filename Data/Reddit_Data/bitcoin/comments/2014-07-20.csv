"Your opinion is *no more substantiated than mine*.  *Both* are subjective.  If you read my responses, you'll see that I don't think the continued existence and use of Bitcoin is unlikely -- hell, I think it's very possible!  I just do not believe that Bitcoin will take over the world banking system.  Is it a possibility?  Of course, but it's also possible that I'm could suddenly quantum tunnel through the earth and burn up in the core.

When I say that ""I don't think Bitcoin will work"", it does not mean that I'm not entertaining the notion that it will work -- simply that I don't think that possibility is very likely.

I do not see why you have to be so bullheaded and have a longwinded debate about a purely semantic issue.  ";1;1;False;Paradigmist;cj2dd1e;DELL is now the world's largest ecommerce business to accept Bitcoin!;2b1zhh;https://twitter.com/MichaelDell/status/490162239983599616

If that is *seriously* your only argument, then obviously I'm going to point out that it's only a semantic difference and obviously I'm not completely certain that Bitcoin will fail -- I only think that it's probable that it will.;1;1;False;Paradigmist;cj2cw43;DELL is now the world's largest ecommerce business to accept Bitcoin!;2b1zhh;https://twitter.com/MichaelDell/status/490162239983599616

"That has nothing to do with my argument or yours.  All that I'm saying is that someone can be informed about Bitcoin and believe it will not succeed to the extent that some diehards claim.  It's conceited of you to suggest that I can't believe that Bitcoin ""won't work"".  On some level, it implies that the burden of proof is on me to prove that Bitcoin is destined to mediocrity, as if something so subjective and arbitrary as an opinion is subject to empirical evidence.  The Bitcoin market -- like any market -- cannot be perfectly modeled, predicted, or speculated on.  That does not mean that one cannot form an opinion on it.";1;1;False;Paradigmist;cj2btav;DELL is now the world's largest ecommerce business to accept Bitcoin!;2b1zhh;https://twitter.com/MichaelDell/status/490162239983599616
"> My personal opinion: Bitcoin as a medium of exchange will continue to exist, will probably build up a dedicated following and see niche use (especially where it truly excels: darknet exchanges), possibly become a household name but never overturn the existing structure.  Bitcoin as an asset will be speculated on for years until it reaches a semblance of stability, at which point the allure of going ""to the moon"" will wear off and plenty of speculators who were more invested in the price of bitcoin than the utility will pull out.";1;0;False;Paradigmist;cj2o1vg;DELL is now the world's largest ecommerce business to accept Bitcoin!;2b1zhh;https://twitter.com/MichaelDell/status/490162239983599616

I'm here to argue, why are you here? 

>I just do not believe that Bitcoin will take over the world banking system.

If you're going to frame the debate as either A) Bitcoin simply facilitates drug trade or B) Bitcoin takes over the world and ushers in a global libertarian utopia then sure, I'd probably go with A too.
