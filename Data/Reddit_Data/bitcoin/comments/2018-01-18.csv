You claim it would take 25 years to make 300% gain on a principal investment in the stock market.

In fact, it only takes *six* years at that rate to double your money or *nine* years to triple it. You obtain average market returns by investing in an index fund which, by definition, performs *exaxtly* as well as the market.

"That is usually true, but even then, I'm not sure it applies here. We're dealing with a brand new technology that the world hasn't completely grasped yet. Blockchain has huge potential, but we're still looking for ways to apply it to real world scenarios (that part is already being done). We're still in uncharted waters here. 

It's not a stock because it isn't equity in anything. It's a ""currency."" But, like traditional currency, it isn't backed by any government or agency. Bitcoin holds value because those of us that own it say it does. It is backed by nothing but a block of code, and people willing to put money into it. 

Right now it's all speculative. No one really knows what a BTC should actually cost right now, and the correction we're experiencing, while drastic, is healthy. Super inflated prices for sometrhing people don't really use as a currency (and why would you...why pay for a pizza with btc when the price could be drastically different tomorrow? By tomorrow, the ~$15 you spent in BTC on that pizza could be worth $30, or $100, or $.01. It's far too volitle to become a feasible currency at this point. 

On top of that, the system needs to be scaled and improved by a lot. Why when I purchase BTC, I don't receive it for like 8 full days? That part is crazy. 

Right now, it's all speculation. Even if someone finds an amazing use for the blockchain and makes billions from it, there's no guarantee that whatever crypto it's tied to will be worth anything or used for anything. 

Right now it's a casino, more or less. And there are a lot of suckers out there who think it's an easy way to get rich. A lot of people did get lucky, but if you buy at 10k, you're not going to get rich unless you bought a LOT, and the prices skyrockets. The ones who got in early are the ones who got rich, which is why people are pouring money into all of these random alt coins that I assume will disappear in the next few years.

">The fact that you made money doesn't change that you didn't know at all how the market worked.

I don't think you understood me, and I respectfully disagree.  I knew (and know) what bitcoin is, how it works, and its intended role in the world.  The only piece of information I was lacking when I initially invested was the transaction time and cost issue, and when I initially became aware of it after buying in I at first wrote it off as not that big a problem because of the current nature of the crypto market.  I think that a main factor in the crash/correction was a large number of investors becoming aware of that particular issue.  I was ahead of the curve on that knowledge and probably should have sold sooner when I suspected it would become a big market factor, but I mis-predicted the impact it would have, and lost some gains as a result, but still came out ahead more or less by luck.  

I seem to disagree with you about the idea of indexing as well.  Technically, there are already at least two ""countries"" using Bitcoin, although they aren't really ""legitimate"" states on the world stage (NK and IS).  My expectation is that countries dealing with runaway inflation may latch on to it as a more stable currency which will drive adoption and value up.  I don't know why you think the word ""coin"" has anything to do with it.  

I don't recall what the rest of my upstream comments were in this particular thread but I mentioned elsewhere that the money I had invested was relatively trivial.  I don't have substantial assets as I'm still buried in student debts and apply most of my income to that.  I had about $3000 set aside for some wiggle room and when I determined that I didn't really need that I played with it on GDAX and had fun and made money.

"What salt? I own lots of Litecoins (almost equal if not more in terms of USD value as I got ETH) but come on, you have to agree it's a joke these days.

Almost all commits being developed for Bitcoin are pasted to LTC (sometimes before Bitcoin's push so it feels LTC is being developed.) 

Litecoin really had no point because Bitcoin is infinitely divisible. It used to be called Bitcoin's silver. LTC will encounter the same scaling problems and will use the same scaling solutions as Bitcoin if it actually gets popular.

If cryptos are to exist, there will be store of value, Bitcoin and smart-contracts and other stuff's platform- which ETH seems like it will win that race. And maybe a good DAG coin. 

LTC is just valuable because it's the first altcoin, and is on all the exchanges so quick arbitrage with cheaper than Bitcoin fees. This is changing soon because of these feeless altcoins though. 

I am serious. These salt replies are annoying. Name one thing LTC can do which other cryptos and bitcoin clones can't. 2.5 minutes blocktime is not impressive. Low tx fees is not impressive.

I still hold LTC because LN will work with it (because it's a bitcoin clone) and so will Atomic swaps. I am holding because I know it still has a big pump left. But it's worthless.";20;1;False;Brighteyes720;dsv96ef;So here's what actually happened Today.;7r5ckm;https://v.redd.it/d2ere91gqpa01

"A few traders making money at the expense of many other people doesn't say anything about the cryptocurrency in question. Any flawed cryptocurrency can do this if it's marketed well for a few weeks or months. Plenty have.

Plenty of cryptocurrencies are shockingly overvalued for the simple reason that they're easier to mine for the average Joe than bitcoin.

Cryptocurrencies that don't have a community of true believers and two competent developers to replace every developer that loses interest are all doomed in my opinion.

I wonder if it was a planned strategy to eventually crashed BTC (this can be done as Bitfinex still manage to drag the price down or pump it up at will now where most major exchanges would followsuit). And for sure Bitfinex profited alot from crashing the BTC by liquidation of their client's margin buy. And prolonged downfall of BTC will surely chase away investor and BCH will be the successor.

"You're not wrong, but the way I see it, BCC ending operations is merely the silver lining, with a lot of damage being done behind it.

Think of it like being a runaway train with no driver. When it crashes, that's good in the sense that the threat is over, however if it killed a bunch of people on the way, that's not much of a cheering point to most.

Overall, when I say it's mostly bad news, I'm saying that because I'm not just looking at BCC, or the events of this week. I'm looking at the whole timeline of all of crypto. BCC to me is a big red flag, because if it existed, then others surely do too, and there aren't safeguard to stop more BCC type scams from popping up. BCC is symbolic of wider issue in this space.

"> You act as your own bank with crypto. What’s hard to understand about that?

That a bank is a pretty damn complex thing? Which makes the comparision kinda absurd.

And you can also just store thousands of dollars at home. Yet in neither case have you any control over the fluctuating value.

> BTC is worth how many 1000% more than it was 5 years ago? 

Because it's volatile as shit. That's not a good thing if you want to long term store money. Who knows what it's worth next month?

Idk if people just get impressed by high numbers, but the changing worth of bitcoin makes it pretty useless as a currency for transactions, or a way to store money. Stable value is a requirement for useful money, that's literally the point of the thing.";8;1;False;reymt;dsubl28;Japans Largest Bank will be Launching its own Cryptocurrency Exchange | Coindelite News;7r0j7e;https://coindelite.com/news/japans-largest-bank-will-be-launching-its-own-cryptocurrency-exchange/

"I’m kind of new to r/bitcoin so I don’t know what the consensus is (if one exists) on regulation, but couldn’t many of the current regulations meant to protect consumers still apply even with a crypto currency?

Do these crimes require a money trail to confirm they were committed, or does the money trail just help? Because the money trail alone never tells the whole story.

I could imagine a scenario where these crimes would play out more like an act of violence in the court room—harder to prove, but still not immune to justice.

"Lol, no, crypto are just different forms of DRM, a way to make digital goods scarce, whiche before was not possible and led to leaks in profits due to duplication and copying and piracy.


Thanksfully, bitcoin prevents all of that, as tying a satoshi to a game key or mp3 requires the limit of only 1 instance of that key, and thanks to blockchain, no one can duplicate or add new keys because the rest of the network would have to agree. 

If you don't see the value in bringing scarcity to digital goods, then you've never been a content creator whose had their work stolen and also lack imagination.


Banks and regulation have nothing to do with it. THough, they will try to centralize account ledgers to prevent money laundering and terrorism funding flows, and all of that. So there will always be an exit or entrance where an ID will be required. Which means centralization.

"the market was literally overvalued because of the whales as they pumped money into alt coins (including DENTACOIN  + DOGECOIN) in order to increase buy ins from normies, then proceeded to crash it once it reached a certain profit.  Has nothing to do with hate.  Has to do with facts of an unregulated market.  There is a reason why something like this isn't allowed on major exchanges when trading stocks.   Thats how crypto works buddy.   The question is whether a normie like you is able to spot when a whale is pumping an altcoin and if you can time it to sell before they crash it.  

Thats not a healthy market reguardless.  A coin is a coin, whales dont care what its called, or whats backing it.  They are more interested in using their assets to create an artificial boon for a coin with high trade volume in hopes normies will jump in due to the surge increase in value and dump it at a higher price than their buy in pump, thus drastically decreasing the value in one fall swoop.  

The fact that you think all major crypto currencies dropping by 50% in mere minutes is because of a mere market overevaluation is just niave.

"What? It is not ""exchanges charging a premium"", it's sellers on the exchanges charging a premium. Do you even understand how an exchange work? Seriously WTF.

>The government had no option but to step in

The problem is entirely caused by government regulation in the first place!

The reason bitcoin sell at a premium in SKorea and India is because their statist governments have strong currency controls that do not allow their currencies to flow freely with the outside world, and therefore has a distorted currency rate. If they had operated less like 20th century socialist walled gardens, and instead allowed international transactions to operate freely like in well functioning economies elsewhere, then the local bitcoin price would not be at a premium.

Another way to look at it is that if in fact bitcoin is selling at a 20% premium, then what this means is that the government has actually inflated the KRW by 20% over what it's actual value should be. Only bitcoin exchanges (due to bitcoin being able to flow freely everywhere) show the correct value of the local currency. And it turns out, the correct value of the KRW is 20% lower than what the government has propped it up to.";26;2;False;probablite;dsv593b;Say THANK YOU to all the citizens of South Korea who have signed.;7r8vsq;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7r8vsq/say_thank_you_to_all_the_citizens_of_south_korea/

"**We the People (petitioning system)**

We the People, launched September 22, 2011, was a section of the whitehouse.gov website (under President Barack Obama) for petitioning the administration's policy experts. Petitions that met a certain threshold of signatures were typically reviewed by Administration officials who prepared and issued official responses, however, this was not always the case. Criminal justice proceedings in the United States and other processes of the federal government are not subject to White House website petitions. We the People, rather, served as a public relations device for the Obama administration to provide a venue for citizens to express themselves.
