I think a lot of the appeal of bitcoin was in an era of far higher fees for sending money. 10 years ago I'm not sure how I'd send money to friends. Today I have venmo square cash and zelle, all of which let me send thousands instantly (except square cash now is dumb and makes you wait a day to withdraw it, but it can still be spent immediately with the built in debit card). Zelle goes directly into the banking account in less than a minute, and you can send 25 grand a month for free. WU used to charge like 10%, now it's down to 2-4%. 

Point is it used to be hard to send money, but that has changed dramatically for the better. Bitcoin needs to be faster and cheaper to serve as an actual currency and not as a purely speculative investment. I'd also like to see it either become more consumer/government friendly (aka easier to prevent illegal activity/charge backs for consumers) or less government/consumer friendly (more anonymous like zcash or monero). 

Right now bitcoin seems to be in a weird middle position where it's not that useful for a soccer mom as it's slow and fees are high, kind of hard to track for the government, but still trackable with some moderate effort.

It fits the criteria of 'rare' even better than Gold as it is impossible for there to be any more than 21 million Bitcoin. New Gold deposits could be discovered at any time. It has some hurdles to overcome regards its use, but on that point alone, most people who have Gold don't use it for ANYTHING other than storing value, and although it does have some, it's not easy to do for the reasons previously stated. Bitcoin is already easier to use, and the more outlets which are developed for that, as well as improvements in the underlying technology which will facilitate this (the Lightning Network for example) the more it will proliferate.

"Bitcoin is somewhat of a hybrid... it's not singularly a currency, asset, equity, commodity or any other singularly definable 'thing'... it's a combination of them all, and there is even a social network element at play in there. This makes it utterly unique and I believe it's why so many people struggle to get their head round it as they want to pigeon hole it, to define what it is... but that is not easily done. 

In essence though, Bitcoin has value for exactly the same reason as the paper money in your wallet (even though, as I say, it's not singularly money)... it simplifies the exchange of goods and services in the modern world. And yes, it CAN do that, and it does have the function and potential to achieve that on a FAR greater scale than it does currently. Furthermore, the value of Bitcoin is directly tied to the number of its users and the frequency of their use. Good old fashioned supply and demand.

The pyramid/ponzi scheme argument has been put forward many times since Bitcoin's inception, but it just doesn't hold any water. Pyramid and ponzi schemes are actually quite different and individually distinctive forms of fraud...  but they share one thing in common: the first ones in make a lot of money while the last ones in foot the bill and invariably lose everything. The initial 'investors' are paid out DIRECTLY from new investors’ money. The return is always too good to be true and the gains (for those who actually get gains) are exponential.

It is actually understandable how someone could look at Bitcoin on the surface and accuse it of being a pyramid... it's value has risen dramatically in a matter of years, so fast that it's hard to keep up sometimes, and as you say, people encourage holding (but not everyone, that's important to say). But then ANY new technology could be accused of this.... it’s just rarely the the case that we get to invest in this sort of technology (and a brand new one at that) and profit as it’s adopted. It is more the unique nature of Bitcoin that has led rise to more of these 'scam' accusations, vs more 'traditional' investments or opportunities. There has never been anything like it.

New technologies follow a known adoption curve, which tends to include a period of exponential rise. Bitcoin is no exception. Ponzis and pyramids both create value for their oldest investors by stealing from the new. There’s no economics involved... just theft. This is categorically NOT what is happening with Bitcoin, so accusations of pyramid/ponzi are flat out false.

Bitcoin creates value for the old investors and the new by splitting a finite currency supply more ways. That’s not trickery or theft, just good-old-fashioned supply and demand at work... a basic and ancient economic principle applied to the world’s newest currency system.

Will it last, I don't know... no one does. Personaly, I believe it will. I think $20k will come and go with ease. On what timeframe it would be impossible to say, but I just believe in this, cheesy and vague as that may sound lol! I can't even fully explain WHY I do to be honest... well, I could reel off countless facts, figures, commentaries etc. but at the end of the day, it just makes perfect sense to me.

"I understand what the blockchain is, technically. How did bitcoin gain value, that I do not easily understand. A higher valued coin will create more incentive for mining which in turn will create a more secure blockchain? But now mining is much more centralized than it was when bitcoin was worth next to nothing. So that argument does not hold value.

> Of course there are plenty of useless shit coins

Apparently the definition of shitcoin is any blockchain on which you don't hold any tokens in. In the Litecoin forum, bitcoin is a shitcoin, and so forth. For now bitcoin holds the advantage of being the easiest to spend. But it's technically very, very easy to accept all currencies wherever bitcoin is accepted now. Platforms that accept bitcoin just sell it for fiat automatically. Connecting to an exchange, you could easily do this for any other coin that the exchange accepts. By that time bitcoin will have some real competition, and people will see that all along the value was in the work that was put into the technology, not in their gambling tokens.

>  Pyramid it is categorically not.

I've never seen an investment scheme where investors strongly preach not to sell, to invest more and to convince others to join, and said scheme was not a pyramid. I myself am actually part of this scheme, bought a few last year and it was $500 because I cought a virus that wanted me to pay in bitcoin. I saw the potential for bubbles right there. I've been following r/bitcin since 2012, and I knew that people don't sell. I believe it may go as high as $20,000 until the world tightens it's security, the governments take real action and finally it doesn't suck any more ""investors"" and it falls on itself.

"From the previous article on a security forum that I posted:  
""Some data may fail to be totally obliterated by a single write due to two phenomena:

We want to write a bit (0 or 1) but the physical signal is analog. Data is stored by manipulating the orientation of groups of atoms within the ferromagnetic medium; when read back, the head yields an analog signal, which is then decoded with a threshold: e.g., if the signal goes above 3.2 (fictitious unit), it is a 1, otherwise, it is a 0. But the medium may have some remanence: possibly, writing a 1 over what was previously a 0 yields 4.5, while writing a 1 over what was already a 1 pumps up the signal to 4.8. By opening the disk and using a more precise sensor, it is conceivable that the difference could be measured with enough reliability to recover the old data.

    Data is organized by tracks on the disk. When writing over existing data, the head is roughly positioned over the previous track, but almost never exactly over that track. Each write operation may have a bit of ""lateral jitter"". Hence, part of the previous data could possibly still be readable ""on the side"".

Multiple writes with various patterns aim at counterbalancing these two effects.

Modern hard disks achieve a very high data density. It makes sense that the higher data density is, the harder it becomes to recover traces of old overwritten data. It is plausible that recovering overwritten data is no longer possible with today's technology. At least, nobody is currently positively advertising such a service (but this does not mean that it cannot be done...).

Note that when a disk detects a damaged sector (checksum failure upon reading), the next write operation over that sector will be silently remapped to a spare sector. This means that the damaged sector (which has at least on wrong bit, but not necessarily more then one) will remain untouched forever after that event, and no amount of rewriting can change that (the disk electronic board itself will refuse to use that sector ever again). If you want to be sure to erase data, it is much better to never let it reach the disk in the first place: use full-disk encryption.""";2;0;False;;dm32s5v;The original Bitcoin faucet used to give away 5 whole bitcoins;6vsmyu;https://i.redd.it/pkpiy0rt4qhz.jpg
"They won't need to, nor does any saving medium need to become worthless, but if Bitcoin does become a more attractive option and enough people DO move a % percentage of their savings in to Bitcoin from Gold, then its value will decrease as a result. This is already happening and clearly there are many people who are more comfortable and confident with their money in Bitcoin than gold. How far this goes, we shall have to see, but if you're saying all these people are suckers who will lose their money, I have to vehemently disagree.

With full disk encryption, thorough destruction of the key material is tantamount to rendering the disk content to random data.

"Thing is, these post-zeroing data recovery techniques all rely on reading the magnetic platter yourself and reconstructing the data based on the leftover magnetism.

If he, from his perspective, ""zeroed"" his drive from software, then recovered some of it in software, there are a few realistic possibilities I can think of:

1) Most likely: He actually interrupted the wiping, or had a power flicker or overheat that restarted his PC, and he thought it was done.  I've had multiple power flickers in a month sometimes, and wiping takes hours, so this isn't impossible.

2) Maybe: his wiping software sucked, such as not flushing to disk properly or something.  I've never used it, I dunno.

"Probably not much in the case of new gold hitting the market, there already is a good deal of gold, so the price drop would be commensurate with the amount of new gold hitting the market. Most of gold's value is based on speculation not actual worth.

"Comparison with a stock like Apple or Google perhaps isn't as fair, but let's take Gold, which I think Bitcoin has far more in common with. That has a market cap of around $7 trillion. Bitcoin is only currently at just over $70 billion. If it managed to achieve a level anywhere near what Gold is, a six figure value will be easy.

Now I know how this may sound, but Gold is not accepted in any stores. It is difficult to transport. You can't use it to buy and sell things over the internet. It is difficult to convert to fiat. But that doesn't prevent trillions dollars of wealth from being parked stationary in this metal.

If in years to come (and yes it's a MASSIVE IF) people have as much confidence in Bitcoin as a store of value as gold, then things could snowball pretty quickly and $500k would easily be surpassed.

"Only governments currently hold SDRs, ""civilians"" can't hold them yet. They've been around since the first issuance back in the 70s I believe it was. There are tons of economic articles on the progression towards the SDR possibly becoming the next reserve currency. It's not a guarantee yet, just what most economists are saying is most likely to happen based on recent economic events and government planning that has happened in the last few years. China being added to the basket of SDRs was huge. I recommend looking up a few of the articles online, just search SDR as new reserve currency"" and read a few different ones because people are looking at it from the same general macro sense but the micro details change based on opinions and worldviews so that will give you a more broad sense of the general movement towards it instead of just one or two people's opinions. One thing I have seen come up more and more often is to partically asset back the SDR to help create stability since all the currencies in the basket are 100% fiat.

"Unless you traded bitcoin for an item without it ever being cashed out into fiat, I'd argue you didn't really buy anything with bitcoin. That type of transaction takes place very rarely.

https://www.saveonsend.com/blog/bitcoin-blockchain-money-transfer/

Is a good article on the subject. The first issue is that bitcoin is too volatile to send large amounts overseas period. A 10% swing is common in bitcoin, and if you're sending say 10M dollars to buy a business then you could easily end up in a scenario where you come up short.

Secondly large bitcoin money transfers are currently illegal if you aren't using a money transmitter service. So your question is tantamount to asking if I can't do something without paperwork and break the law. I can, but again it's illegal. 

Also what if you wanted to send money to Bolivia? Or Ecuador? Or Kyrgyzstan ? Or Saudi Arabia? Or Bangladesh?

What if you want to send money to Spain? Well okay fine, but that's actually seen as a barter transaction and subject to 7% taxes! Probably better to just pay a couple percent for WU.

The point is it's different in every country, and ignoring the law allows it to be easy, but again the whole breaking the law thing. 

They wouldn't care about 1k, but if you're sending tens of thousands or millions they'll likely come knocking. Several in the US have been arrested for illegal money transferring operations already. 

**Similarly when you sell your bitcoins for $ you need to pay capital gains tax.** You can get away with it if you're not selling much, probably, but the IRS is going to get its pound of flesh, and anyone at 10k+ in value should expect to pay capital gains on it. 

So in sum:
You can send money via bitcoin if you first pay money to put it into bitcoin, and then spend money on transaction fees, and then pay applicable taxes in country you're sending it to, and then the recipient pays taxes depending on local laws and then pays more money to convert it into local currency to actually buy things, unless it's banned which it already is in 5 countries or so. So I hope you and your recipient have intimate legal knowledge, otherwise you could be screwed. 

Or pay about 1-4% and send money legally with currency conversion with any number of authorized money transmitters.


Eventually crypto will be cheaper to send, as long as it doesn't need to be converted into local currency, the spread is less, the volatility is lower and the government decides not to tax/ban it. Right now it's honestly worse.

If you're sending money and not having to convert currency there is generally no fee at all (look up Philippines to US in USD). I imagine Europe is similar to US in having no fees for domestic transfers, but if not they will be soon.";1;1;False;Reigningchamp4eva;dm41jr6;The original Bitcoin faucet used to give away 5 whole bitcoins;6vsmyu;https://i.redd.it/pkpiy0rt4qhz.jpg
"I perform digital forensics semi-regularly and can confirm these tools absolutely exist ([FTK](http://accessdata.com/products-services/forensic-toolkit-ftk) is the 'Adobe Creative Suite' of its field).  They work rather well, especially on NTFS drives, which are Windows standard.

Reading data from newer HDD's works just as well.  You simply hook it up to a read-only SATA cable and load it in.  Like you said, deleting data without overwrite leaves it on there.  All of the data on a hard drive is stored in fragments throughout, and the Master File Table (MFT) is the index that keeps a record of which blocks contain what data.  When you delete a file, all your PC does is tells the MFT that those blocks can be considered free space again.  They may or may not get overwritten by random chance at some point in the future.

Reading the HDD bit-by-bit is just as easy on modern drives as it is on older ones, except for time required.  It can take hours to fully read and scan a 1TB drive.  And you can read every block and usually go through it with a hex reader.  The toolkits like FTK will do their damn best to assemble an entire windows explorer folder tree of the drive, pulling together fragmented data when possible.

The really scary tools out of mythos are the ones that can detect data even after an overwrite.

"> Bitcoin has value for exactly the same reason as the paper money

Fully agree on this. Both have value through consensus; one is maintained by the governments while the other solely by public consensus. Money is a very delicate matter though. Old money (cash, bank accounts, obligations etc.) is very traceable. While bitcoin is not. This is why there were no public-grade ransomware before bitcoin. There is no way to receive money without being traced. For now, bitcoin is limited to viruses. But if in a future bitcoin becomes ubiquitous, one can easily envision anonymous criminals putting a ransom on people's lifes. They can contact anonymously hundreds of people asking for bitcoins, and from the group that doesn't pay up they can kill some time in the future one or two of them. Imagine the panic in the population! This isn't commonplace now because there is no safe way to initiate this kind of ransom. But with bitcoin, this becomes child's play. Anyone, even a teenager from his room, can make disrupt your life with such a ransom. And for how much we scorn governments, when bitcoin takes over and the people ""take control"" away from their government, there will be much less protection. People in the advanced countries are fed up with their governments. Bu, I live in a country that 20 years ago went into anarchy, and I can tell you that you have no idea what a hell-hole society becomes without a string government.

> ANY new technology could be accused of this

Blockchain is the technology. Bitcoin is just an implementation of that. It's like saying your Windows installation is a technology. I don't think that the billions that have been invested in the blockchain technology are a scam. It's actually a beautiful technology with a lot of potential. At this stage, bitcoin itself should be worth a few million dollars, like 50 million. Just something to hold inertial value. And definitely not something that changes in value! Bitcoin is a simple bearer of the blockchain technology. One that can be substituted at any time by any organization as they see fit for their projects. Blizzard for example can use the blockchain as WoW money. This doesn't mean that they must or should use bitcoin.

> This is categorically NOT what is happening with Bitcoin, so accusations of pyramid/ponzi are flat out false

This entire paragraph is just an opinion. Bitcoin is not a controlled pyramid scheme. There is no mastermind anymore, although there are whales. It's the people's pyramid. Greedy people like me and you have turned it into a pyramid. We are gamblers. Bitcoin seems like a good way to profit.

> That’s not trickery or theft, just good-old-fashioned supply and demand at work

Can't you see, everything on bitcoin revolves around it doubling in value every few months. People want it because it'll make them rich. People don't sell it, because in a few months they can sell it for double. Like that guy who saved on groceries to buy more bitcoins.

They mention remittances, I don't know about that. But outside of that, there is no single legal use of bitcoin thats better than cash, credit or bank transfer. In fact, even in remitances, bitcoin is used to bypass the government, albeit in that case a very corrupt one. Yes, bitcoin can be a faster and a little cheaper than a bank transfer. But with banks in the middle you are fully protected. Everyone is a government-registered entity. Everything is reversible. I can send my employee to make the transfer for me. Or do it through the commodity of my virus infested PC. Bitcoin is hell as a money exchange medium. People advocate to hold it in paper and check back in 10 years... you really can't see the absurdity of it all? And even in the cases that advocate spending, it's always finalized with ""buy back what you spend"". Create artificial use.

Personally, I don't mind bitcoin reaching any value. What has disgusted me is the behavior of the people who hold bitcoin tokens. I've honestly never seen as much hypocrisy as there is in the bitcoin world.
