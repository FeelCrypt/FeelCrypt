"The real key here is that its a shortcut. If you haven't invested more than you can afford to lose, you won't be tempted to sell when it feels like its going to zero. Breaks the ""buy high sell low"" cycle. If you bought at 20k or 14k or whatever, you'll be fine - eventually. Its that eventually that gets people. They don't have the stomach to sit on it at 4k when everyone is calling for 2k because they have too much invested. If you only have a little invested, your head is much clearer. Heck you might even buy more because it looks cheap to you (instead of you worrying about how much you just ""lost"").";4;0;False;zenethics;f8w3ot8;Giving Advice about Bitcoin at Thanksgiving;e2icxt;https://i.redd.it/2z6w16j299141.jpg
