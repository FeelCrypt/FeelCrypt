" r/BTCWiki  What's going on with the field?

I don't understand. Is Bitcoin price ever going to rise? I'm tired of all the predictions...";1;0;False;Brandowplays;e0p6kjq;This video of old school astronauts criticizing Elon saying he'll fail reminds me of Warren Buffett and others saying Crypto will fail;7wavza;https://youtu.be/CyGqMZQAMio
We cannot blame those people who unconsciously focused themselves into that, especially those who longed for a long time to solve their financial problems. In cryptocurrency's industry, there's also a problem, especially those who manipulation market prices. Thanks to the [new platform](https://www.killerwhale.io/) created to solve it. But I got your point, since some really had forgotten some important values. That's why it's important to have a self check from time to time.;1;0;False;KillerWhaleToken;e0oq1bj;When did the value of crypto become the only thing we focus on?;7m8z0e;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7m8z0e/when_did_the_value_of_crypto_become_the_only/

 looking at the same thing now, if it is, I think I know where it is. Was going along one way of thinking from the clues given by the OP but it lead nowhere except linking to this place. There's lots of pointers to suggest its the right place but the map seems to be a bit scrambled as though the same place is in 2 different spots maybe need to pair things up somehow. Thought maybe the I's were large  bridges and the = were foot bridges although it doesn't fully work out right. I fear like all the other puzzles it will involve some form of coding that is beyond me always seem to get to the point with these where I can understand it but do not have the skills to solve it.  It could be that this is just another set of clues that leads onto somewhere else, I did think of something which oddly enough then links back to BTC there was a few obvious answers there but lacking any understanding of order I got stuck there so have come back to this. I just cant find much meaning in the numbers other than pointers to places yet think they must be important. Op said you can ignore at least half the words (or something like that) but never said anything about ignoring or disregarding the numbers.;1;0;False;spacekadet75;e0oxzaz;1 BTC is hidden in this puzzle.
