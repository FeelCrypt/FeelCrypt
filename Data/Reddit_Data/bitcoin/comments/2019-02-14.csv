">In either case emotion is able to overpower their rational thought due to physical deficits in the brain not a bad upbringing.

I'm not sure you're grasping the latest research here. The ""bad upbringing"" is causing the physical deficits. I'm at work or I'd link some great research on the impact of just *poverty* on mental mass and cortical surface area, let alone further topics discussing traumatic events and unstable homes.

I mean, shit, lead exposure? Pre-natal vitamins? A healthy diet? All intrinsic to or missing from a 'bad upbringing'.

"My username is actually intended to discourage people from just downvoting me and get them to explain why they disagree and actually have a conversation. I know it winds some people up because they think I'm being arrogant and proclaiming that *I can't be proven wrong* but it still works because some people can't resist the challenge and I think that's worth the turbulence. Maybe the comment you first responded to was a little rude but I was trying to point out that this style of argument gets us nowhere but round in circles.

I understand that the judge had every legal right to give him the sentence that he got but if that sentence would have been lesser had he not tried to have people killed then yes, he is serving time for that crime (whether or not that's what it says on the paperwork). And he should! But he should be tried for it. I'm not arguing for absolute sentences. I know there are countless other variables that can't possibly be coded into law and people fall between the cracks. It sucks but it's life. If it's purely a case of human fallibility on the part of the judge then there isn't really anything more to say on the matter unless the judge's sentencing procedure can be questioned (what I was asking originally). Also if the sentence has nothing to do with his other crimes then it's a moot point. But if he serves more time because of crimes he has not been tried for then I don't think that's justice and the law has failed. Even if he's guilty.

Imagine you were arrested for something that carries a 1-5 year prison sentence and the arresting officer falsely accuses you of assaulting them. If you think you can prove you were innocent of the original crime you would put your energy into disproving that and not worry about the assault until you're actually charged. If you are then found guilty and given the full five years because the coinciding (untrue) assault shows that you are a danger to society when otherwise it would have been a one year sentence, is that justice? Or are you spending four years in prison for a crime you did not commit?

This wording suggests that the judge needs to base his sentence on the evidence of the case. I was asking if that is enforced or if its just how they're expected to do their jobs. I'm completely aware that his sentence is for the crimes he was convicted of in the eyes of the law but if he has a harsher sentence because of other crimes he committed then he is being punished for them without trial. Legal or not. If evidence came to light that proved that he never attempted to have anyone killed he wouldn't be able to appeal that conviction because it doesn't exist, yet may be the reason he will never get out of prison.

"The judge is not bound by the prosecution's recommendation. Unless there is a statutory minimum or maximum (i.e., the law itself requires you get 5 years but no more than 20), the judge can do whatever he wants, including sentence you to probation. However, the district judge's sentence is always appealable, by both the defense and the prosecution, for unreasonableness. If the judge gave you probation on a murder, the prosecution would appeal; if he gave you life for tax evasion, the defense would appeal. The appellate court would then adjust the sentence. 

&#x200B;

To your second question, the technical answer is yes - you can file a writ of habeas corpus, attempting to challenge your sentence, but this would be unlikely to happen and less likely to succeed. First, it's rare that other crimes are proved to be untrue; but second, judges are always careful to couch their sentencing language (as this judge did here) to suggest that they would've given the same sentence regardless of the aggravating uncharged crimes. That said, it is certainly a very interesting legal question and would present an interesting challenge to any lawyer that found a client in those circumstances.

I agree over sentencing in this country is insane, but I don't disagree with him getting a life sentence.  He was involved in tons of crimes that are going to stack up.  He purposely tried to hide who he was because he knew he was committing crimes.

In california a woman got 20 years in jail for stealing a package off a porch.  Why?  It was her third strike and she did it while she was still on probation from the last crime.

Crimes add up and normal people don't fall into these situations.  This isn't like Aaron Swartz where he was committing civil offenses and they were charging him with tons of vague computer criminal laws to end his life.

Ulbricht was committing tons of real crimes to profit off it.  Maybe if he was running a non-profit, that would be different, but he was running a crime network for personal profit, not some kind of sense of personal freedom.";7;0;False;montyprime;egf4woa;El Chapo will most likely get LESS time than Ross Ulbricht.

"Read Adrian Raine’s “Anatomy if violence”. The problem is when you don’t have free will you’re at the disposal of the physical brain. If a part’s not working right then you’re missing what that part provide. 

A life of crime may have been caused by an inability to internalize punishment. No matter how you punish that person they take nothing from it. Another criminal with poor impulse control may understand what they did was bad but be incapable of stoping themselves in the moment. 

It’s not a coincidence hot-blooded criminals are characterized as having damaged/defective prefrontal cortices, what’s responsible for controlling emotions and thinking of consequences, or overactive amygdala, responsible for producing emotions. In either case emotion is able to overpower their rational thought due to physical deficits in the brain not a bad upbringing. 

This can’t be fixed by “simply conditioning” them. We are no where near fixing a broken brain on that level. But even if we were there’s huge ethical issues with messing with someone’s personality. What’s the limit? How much do you fix them? How do you decide who’s bad enough to need it? On some level all of us have issues that might be deemed fixable until we all living in the gray world of “The Giver.”";8;3;False;shhhhNSFW;egfw2hm;El Chapo will most likely get LESS time than Ross Ulbricht.

"**Ross Ulbricht**

Ross William Ulbricht (born March 27, 1984) is a convicted American darknet market operator and narcotics trafficker, best known for creating and running the Silk Road website from 2011 until his arrest in 2013. He was known under the pseudonym ""Dread Pirate Roberts,"" after the fictional character in the novel The Princess Bride (1973) and its 1987 film adaptation.

Ulbricht was convicted of money laundering, computer hacking, conspiracy to traffic fraudulent identity documents, and conspiracy to traffic narcotics by means of the Internet in February 2015. He is currently serving a double life sentence plus forty years without the possibility of parole.

"**Ross Ulbricht**

Ross William Ulbricht (born March 27, 1984) is a convicted American darknet market operator and narcotics trafficker, best known for creating and running the Silk Road website from 2011 until his arrest in 2013. He was known under the pseudonym ""Dread Pirate Roberts,"" after the fictional character in the novel The Princess Bride (1973) and its 1987 film adaptation.

Ulbricht was convicted of money laundering, computer hacking, conspiracy to traffic fraudulent identity documents, and conspiracy to traffic narcotics by means of the Internet in February 2015. He is currently serving a double life sentence plus forty years without the possibility of parole.

At some point, theres an argument that the sentence is inherently unfair and worthy of a commutation.

"Against my better judgement I'm going to jump in here. 

I'll start out by saying that Ross definitely deserves some jail time. Under the laws of the jurisdiction he resided in, he broke some laws. He had chances to plea out he and they threw the book at him. 

Drug laws as they are written today are really silly, counter productive, and ultimately hurt communities more than they help. The drug laws and prohibition create the black market that allowed DPR to flourish. The same way Al Capone flourished during the prohibition. 

Darknet market trading has not stopped with his incarceration. It has only expanded and diversified. Granted that users and sellers need to be much more careful now. 

DPR ran a criminal organization of sorts. There is no denying that. Ross admitted to starting SR in court. There is no denying that. 

Using laws designed for a violent mafia boss on a young kid from the bay area is overkill to say the least. We're going to spend millions keeping him under lock and key for the rest of his life. It's an absolute waste of a life and taxpayer resources. 

That having been said. 

>Ross ordered hits on 4/5 people total. The evidence that he did this is clear. 

DPR (because I'm not convinced there was only one site leader) allegedly ordered hits on 4/5 people, after the agents involved (now in jail for being bad apples) setup a series of events that led to that hit being orchestrated. 

They did indeed find a diary detailing those hits on Ross's computer.

But playing devil's advocate:

Was the diary the only copy or was it downloaded from elsewhere? Was it accessed and modified before his arrest? Were more than one person sharing the DPR account and subsequent chat logs connected to it? 

We don't know. We probably never will know. Various parties connected to SR and unconnected to SR dispute that there was only one DPR. [Given that someone logged into his account](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/qkjm4m/someone-accessed-dread-pirate-roberts-silk-road-operators-account-while-ross-ulbricht-was-in-jail)  while he was in jail. This could arguably be LEO's poking around and isn't proof that the real DPR is on a beach somewhere. 

I can't find the link at the moment but there was also a SR employee who had a codeword to verify with DPR that he was speaking with the real DPR (some basic opsec) and DPR failed at one point to verify that codeword (this was before Ross's arrest). 

This is all still circumstantial and obviously not grounds to spring him out of jail. 

From what we've gleaned from the court records, Ross's attorney and his mother there is a great deal of non-public information that was not allowed to be disseminated in court.   Including the testimony about DPR possibly being Mark Karpeles (lol?) being stricken from the record over the weekend. This says to me that the court wanted to quash any notion of there being another person under the DPR monniker, which is not really fair if you ask me. 

There is much that is still not public relating to Silk Road I'm guessing and we will never get the whole story. 

IIRC They have not accurately explained how they even found the SR server in the first place either. The accounts provided have been disputed.

One odd thing that really stands out to me however is the judge.

Katherine Forest. 

Per Wikipedia ""Forrest was nominated by Obama to the bench in May 2011 on the recommendation of U.S. Senator Charles Schumer of New York.""[who made Silk Road a public vendetta in 2011.](https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Schumer-Calls-on-Feds-to-Shut-Down-Online-Drug-Marketplace-123187958.html) 

Somehow she gets assigned the Silk Road case. Coincidence maybe. 

>No one here likes talking about this because it ruins the narrative. 

The Bitcoin community in general is very distrustful of governmental bodies. With good reason. There's a lot of libertarians here who saw Silk Road as a step towards progress in regards to making drug user safer in a climate that would not tolerate talk of legalizing or harm reduction. The judge dismissed the harm reduction aspects of Silk Road as well during sentencing. 

When Ross was arrested all we heard about was the murder for hire. It dominated every headline. It was the only thing anyone knew about the case. Internet drugs and murder for hire. Yet as has already been discussed these charges eventually went nowhere. IMO it was a smear job to taint the narrative and to paint Ross as a REALLY BAD DUDE. 

He might be a really bad dude. We don't know for certain, he certainly seems to have started the site with good intentions. 

His sentencing was pretty painful from outside observers too. He was treated as if he gunned down 30 people and was on trial for mass murder. 

They had no problem parading several unverified overdose victims and their families into the court room during sentencing. But from the libertarian standpoint choosing to do drugs come with risks, and SR did arguably provide the tools to be as safe as possible with them and subsidized them. 

Forrest is inherently wrong when she said ""Silk Road brought drugs to communities that didn't have access to  them, in ""staggering quantities."" Drugs find their way to wherever there is demand, Silk Road ultimately just reduced the friction of demand and distribution by allowing buyers and seller to be more easily connected. No one was even at that point talking about pharma companies pumping opioids into every community in America. 

Drug users will find drugs if they truly want them. They're on every street corner in America, they're in every prison. Years later it's easier than ever to find fentanyl, heroin, and other drugs on the streets or online. 

Chapo has been sentenced but the feds are still seizing fentanyl and meth at the border. Someone else is running the cartel. 

>Not that it'll save me from downvotes, but El Chapo is significantly worse than Ross, and any system that gives Chapo less time than Ross is busted. 

Agree. Chapo actually killed people. Probably lots of other horrible stuff we will never hear of. DPR typed words on a screen, allegedly. 

>But, to ignore that Ross didn't try and have people executed is doing no favors to anyone who wants to have an honest discussion about justice.

Again, DPR did assuming no foul play or tampering. Not even Curtis Green the guy who DPR ordered a hit on actually thinks Ross did it last I checked. 

Do we have definitive proof that it was Ross sitting behind the keyboard typing those words? Not really.

If I logged into your reddit account and made online threats would that justify imprisoning you? Not really. 

In any event, I would have preferred to see Ross in jail for a few years and go on to use his talents elsewhere. He does not deserve to lose his life as so many others have to the tragedy that is the war on drugs. 

DPR put Bitcoin on the map and gave Bitcoin it's first marketplace usecase. He will forever have a place in Bitcoin history, for better or for worse. 

I hope this came across as intended not as a FREE ROSS NOW HES INNOCENT but as a ""this entire thing was kind of shady/political that lacked a nuanced and fair sentence"".

"We really need to redo, as an entire society, how we think of justice.

We have the whole of advanced neuroscience out here telling us that free will and choice are myths. That the mind is simply conditioned, at the very deepest levels, from the very beginning of life, to think, act, and respond to the stimuli of the world.

Prison should be a place about reconditioning that mind, to react differently to those stimuli.

And as a nation founded on Enlightenment principles, we should remember this:

>Anything more then what is absolutely necessary, is tyranny.

But I just guess that wouldn't make millions of dollars from the state for locking up the poor for being poor.

the thing is, this is not about revenge, they do double life + 40, in case 1 or 2 of the cases are overturned he is still in jail, its a fail safe, its not extra punishment its simply to prevent the scenario where there is a procedural error and someone walks free;8;0;False;kenuffff;egf60mt;El Chapo will most likely get LESS time than Ross Ulbricht.

From what i have read its because they havent found any bodies. And could not put a face to the username he wanted to have killed. This case/story is really fucking nuts. One of the federal agents got caught stealing over 20 or something million dollars in bitcoins from ross as well. A lot of crazy shit happened during the long and grueling investigation.. so who knows what the prosecutions mind set was..;2;2;False;ResponsiblePain;egfwr10;El Chapo will most likely get LESS time than Ross Ulbricht.
