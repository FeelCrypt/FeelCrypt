This is complete nonsense. The relative centralization or decentralization of the system as a whole has much more to do with non-mining nodes than mining nodes. It is the decentralization of the **ability to validate the ledger** that is what gives Bitcoin its security. Everyone who is not validating the ledger independently themselves is explicitly trusting both the miners and others validating. To them it is fundamentally not much different from the current banking system and having to trust the ledger is not being fudged with. They are simply more secure in that trust because of how _distributed_ that ledger is amongst validaters. Every step you take in raising the costs of validating that ledger centralizes the copies of the ledger in a small group of validaters and factually weakens the entire core value proposition of Bitcoin in the first place by pushing it in a direction that emulates banks closer and closer. ;3;1;False;shinobimonkey;di6bsjb;PSA: If you're new here and wondering how bitcoin works, take an hour or two to read through the whitepaper.

"Well, I appreciate the condescension, and yes, I do happen to code for a living so I have a decent idea. The network can handle higher loads. I am not saying it should, because that would be prohibitively expensive to run such a node at today's prices. Right now there isn't much incentive to run a node to begin with because bitcoin is kind of unusable for common transactions with the currently prohibitive fees. If however you look into the future and assume a steady increase in storage capacity and equally so internet bandwidth, then I could totally see having a real reason for many people running a full node assuming bitcoin were to handle visa-level of transactions and become a de-facto standard way to buy/sell things. All of this is obviously irrelevant right now because nobody sane is calling for unlimited block size, specifically due to the aforementioned issue. It should be scaled up gradually; the contention is that that scaling up is not part of the white paper, and neither was layer 2 stuff, so doing that implies a hard fork, which obviously we want to avoid whereas realistically possible. You have to understand though; as far as the BlockChain is concerned, there is no inherent capacity limit; basically unlimited transactions are possible. SegWit isn't a hard requirement to do so. The real issue is that you want enough full nodes that are able to handle the lightweight client requests at a reasonable speed at the very minimum. Without that, the decentralization fails to provide the service. Theorically if there were just one full node and it could handle all requests then that would be enough for bitcoin to work, but obviously that is not what we want. Ironically, this isn't so far off from what off-chain transactions are -- the specifics of how the off-chain transactions are completed might be centralized or not, it is impossible to know.";0;2;False;manly_;di66915;PSA: If you're new here and wondering how bitcoin works, take an hour or two to read through the whitepaper.

If you want to promote it as a currency of use, that's a reality that has to be acknowledged and intelligently addressed.

Since bitcoin is effectively a more technological commodity, it's unlikely to ever be used for those in its current practice.

"Ehhh, I was with you until bug free programming. My understanding is that bitcoin released with a lot of bugs and it took years for the community to iron them out. There was that one bug that allowed somebody to create 180 million or so bitcoin out of thin air in 2013, that required a hard fork to fix (unless I'm mixing up my facts).

Still impressive. As Steinbeck said (paraphrasing), the greatest thing a man can do is the act of individual creation.

"Again: you're speaking for you. I'm speaking for the statistically identifiable mass of consumers, who are an observable phenomenon. It's not about whether they *should* buy at Amazon vs Wal-Mart vs Overstock, it's which do they *actually* buy at. 

Cars may not be important to you. Great. I don't own one either. I live in a city where parking is $300/month, everything is in walking distance, and public transport is superb. Move to Atlanta, or Houston, or Phoenix, or most of flyover country and see how fast you buy one. And unless you're uncommonly wealthy...buy with a loan. Those people buying cars with bitcoin are paying outright, not taking out loans in bitcoin. 

You're making my case for me. Your response isn't a realistic appraisal of the role of bitcoin in the broader economic context, it's a mix of anecdote and idealism, that focuses on ought, not observable data.

"the idea is some people want bitcoin to be a store of value settlement layer, and move the focus to L2 sidechains/lightning with its own distinct fee system

other people (miners in particular), want to ensure use of the L1 blockchain is a prominent feature of bitcoin. more transactions = more miner income. limiting blocksize forces high fee/kb rates, when having twice as many transactions with half the fee would be virtually no added hassle to miners and help map a path to a much larger maxblocksize that miners can soft-regulate
