Well, prevent Internet is easy, prevent it from getting any reception is not that easy, you can't just get a normal room and lock yourself there. ;1;1;False;Funnnny;cg7u4db;In the near future...;20r3a1;https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*A_V4-l0Loh6CFbHyM5Qg5A.jpeg
It's becoming more common to make ghetto faraday cages (aka a lot of aluminum foil) to prevent shit like that from working to disable the phone after it is stolen. ;1;0;False;;cg7ttzq;In the near future...;20r3a1;https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*A_V4-l0Loh6CFbHyM5Qg5A.jpeg
Tin foil, your move! And before you ask, if they're stealing it for the purposes of stealing your bitcoins they'd know how to prevent it from getting reception. ;1;1;False;;cg7tvcl;In the near future...;20r3a1;https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*A_V4-l0Loh6CFbHyM5Qg5A.jpeg
"Nah but foil actually does apparently work sufficiently well. If someone was stealing bitcoins (in the future) 20 bucks of tin foil to build a ghetto faraday cage in an old bathroom could be a thing I imagine. Can wrap it up during the mugging and then unwrap it in the bathroom. 

Currently people use the foil thing to steal shit from stores.";1;0;False;;cg7ur5z;In the near future...;20r3a1;https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*A_V4-l0Loh6CFbHyM5Qg5A.jpeg
"Okay now you have an angry mugger with a gun demanding you give him your bitcoins. Aaaaaaaand now he shot you. aaaaaaaaaand now you're dead. 

Today they are annoyed they can't steal your bank account info, but that annoyance is directed toward the bank. The difference is with bitcoin, you're just not giving it to them (hence the potential for violence).";2;0;False;;cg7tz9q;In the near future...;20r3a1;https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*A_V4-l0Loh6CFbHyM5Qg5A.jpeg
Which is why there are limits on withdrawals, and cameras in/around ATMs! ;1;0;False;;cg7u29i;In the near future...;20r3a1;https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*A_V4-l0Loh6CFbHyM5Qg5A.jpeg

Copying bits is an inherent feature of this universe, not a personal insult to you.;0;0;False;mungojelly;cg7z8tz;In the near future...;20r3a1;https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*A_V4-l0Loh6CFbHyM5Qg5A.jpeg
Yea, I saw that.  Otherwize OP would be due for something slightly closer to evisceration.  Clickable links are a good courtesy though.;1;0;False;arbiter_;cg7w4gi;In the near future...;20r3a1;https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*A_V4-l0Loh6CFbHyM5Qg5A.jpeg
