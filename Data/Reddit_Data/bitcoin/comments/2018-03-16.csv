My trading strategy;1;0;False;minchita;dvske5w;When you are trying to buy the dip;81qkxp;https://v.redd.it/14187bzhakj01
"Thanks for the comment. 

You clearly understand CDOs and CDSs so it's nice to not have to get into that, but where your argument becomes flawed, I think, is when you talk about Fannie and AIG taking on the risk because the American people are (essentially) powerless to stop it even if they knew it was going on. While it may be *partially* true, if you look back at data from that time, banks themselves were huge sellers of CDSs. They made up 67% of the market according to that article, which I have no reason to doubt. I think there was even a part in Big Short where they talked about JPM being on both sides of the trade unknowingly (could be wrong, it's been a while since I saw it). Anyway, you had financial powerhouses like [Barclays, JPM, and Goldman](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/6061785/Barclays-rises-to-become-third-biggest-dealer-of-credit-default-swaps.html) with huge exposure to the short side of the CDS trade. 

Granted, they were acting as market makers based on most articles I've read, but if they *knew* that the bottom could fall out on these things, there's no way they would take on that kind of risk even transiently because *when* shit hits the fan there would be no one to buy back the CDSs from. It's the same as the XIV debacle last month, once the contango broke and people saw the feedback loop that was going to occur, there were no sellers of VIX futures left and it spiked massively within minutes. The difference is that VIX is a relatively old measure that everyone knows mean reverts, whereas MBSs (and consequently CDOs and CDSs built on top of them) were not as well understood.

To use your analogy, Clinton and Greenspan (although I would place the blame on only Greenspan) did insure all this nonsense using taxpayer dollars, but their buddies at JPM and Goldman were also doing the same thing. Where the taxpayer got screwed was *after* everything went down when Bernanke agreed that the taxpayer would take on the losses that all of Greenspan's buddies were holding. I'm conflicted on that because on the one hand, it's a moral hazard to bail them out, but on the other hand, if they *weren't* bailed out, the American people may very well have suffered ever more than they did. I say this because I think that if some of the banks at risk had to dissolve, it would likely have rippled to consumer-facing banks and people would have outright lost their savings in a matter of weeks as opposed to just their jobs.

"People who can actually value and speculate traunched debt collectibility are limited and the whole industry knew it, because they paid quants millions who still did valuations with giant caveats saying they can’t account for systematic failures in their models. If quants couldn’t do it while getting paid millions, folks at Moody’s and S&P sure couldn’t, and bankers knew that. Therefore it’s safe to assume they didn’t rely heavily on those ratings. 

If they weren’t able to insure the securities which no one could value, then you wouldn’t buy and sell them at the volumes they were since the exposure would be too large. UNLESS someone could insure these risky speculative investments. But who would insure risky securities if you didn’t know what your risk was? No one would, which is why AIG and Fannie Mae were funded by tax payer dollars to sell insurance, because tax payers can’t decide on the risk they do or do not want to take on. It all leads back to The government sponsored entities (GSEs) that we’re established to “get the economy going” by incentiving banks to write mortgages, since owning a home is a sign of the American dream.

"> If quants couldn’t do it while getting paid millions, folks at Moody’s and S&P sure couldn’t, and bankers knew that. Therefore it’s safe to assume they didn’t rely heavily on those ratings.

The bankers probably knew the ratings were BS, but my point is they relied on them to sell MBS to pension funds and other investors who thought they were buying AAA rated debt that could never fail.

> which is why AIG and Fannie Mae were funded by tax payer dollars to sell insurance

Don't know if I'd phrase it like that, but there was definitely a failure of AIG to do due diligence on what they were insuring.

"I mentioned this in another comment thread, but as you said, the big short did make it seem like it was easy to understand and value CDOs. In reality though, people who can actually value and speculate traunched debt collectibility are limited, and those who could actually account for what happened were virtually non-existent, and the whole industry knew it. They knew it because they paid quants millions who even with all the incentive in the world, still could only build valuation models with giant caveats saying that they can’t account for systematic failures or sweeping default rates in their models. If quants couldn’t do it while getting paid millions, folks at Moody’s and S&P sure couldn’t, and bankers knew that. Therefore it’s safe to assume they didn’t rely heavily on those ratings.

That being said, if you had all of these securities which you leveraged up to buy and sell (giving yourself huge exposure) which no one could value, then you wouldn’t buy and sell them at the volumes they were since the risk exposure would be too large. If the risk was actually known no one would have allowed their ass to be on the line should these things lose even 10% of their value, let alone all of their value in some cases. 

UNLESS of course, someone could insure these risky speculative investments, thereby mitigating your risk of the unknown. But who in their right mind would insure risky/highly speculative securities if you didn’t know what the underlying value or what the probability of events would be from an actuarial standpoint? No one would, which is why AIG and Fannie Mae were funded by tax payer dollars to sell insurance, default swap, and other financial packages around these securities, because tax payers can’t decide on the risk they do or do not want to take on. It all leads back to The Government Sponsored Entities (GSEs) that we’re established to build the impression of an auspicious, steamrolling economy, and to “get the economy going” by incentiving banks to write mortgages. They believed Americans purchasing homes was a sign of a strong economy and prosperity, because historically, it actually was a good sign! However, they wanted to do this by artificial means via government intervention, because the rate at which loans were being made to sub-prime borrowers would have never happened naturally.

I always like using this analogy to illustrate. Imagine a meth'd out sketchy/homeless person on the street comes up to you and says 

*""Hey man, if you give ten bucks today, I'll give you twenty dollars tomorrow.""*

What are the odds a normal person gives this person 10 dollars with the expectation they'll get 20 bucks back the next day? Slim to none. However, as you're about to say ""thanks but no thanks"" to this person, Bill Clinton and Allen Greenspan come up to you and say: 

*""Excuse me sir, we need you to loan this man 10 dollars for the good of the country. We understand it's risky, but people deserve a right to the American Dream, and this man needs 10 dollars to spend to make it seem like the American Dream is alive and well. We believe this man will certainly pay you back what he says he will, but since we know you're apprehensive to follow through with this transaction, we will insure your investment with him at an extremely cheap rate never before seen in the securities industry so you won't lose your initial investment (even though we know he's good for it.)""*

Enter AIG & Fannie Mae... whose exposure to CDOs via credit default swap packages (CDSs) were outrageous and not at all hedged (most insurance companies make sure they have hedges and diversification in their insurance portfolio - i.e. if something fails and they need to pay out money, they have other investments which increase as a result of such failures and offset their losses - AIG and Fannie Mae did not do this.

The homeless man ends up not paying you, so you go to Bill & Greenspan and ask for your 9.97 back (.03 fee for the insurance, obviously.) But it turns out they did this with millions of people, for hundreds of billions of dollars, and everyone is coming to them at once for their money back. But they don't have it. So now the Government is in an unfortunate position, and has no choice but to initiate TARP so that capital markets don't seize entirely. They then double down on what they've been doing by lowering interest rates, which again, is an artificial market intervention that encourages risky lending practices since the cost of money is so cheap. We're still here today, and risky lending (whether it be student or sub-prime car loans) is still pervasive because of it.";1;2;False;MyNamesJudge;dvshncy;Remember: NOBODY went to jail for '08, and now US Senate moves forward with bill, easing regulations on banks;84i8wh;https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/14/politics/banking-bill-vote-mike-crapo/index.html

"""Easing regulations on banks"" is a misnomer. What is going to happen is that the government is going to look the other way when the banks commit what many would consider unethical. This is because its government collusion that cornered the banking industry for them, and brought us where we are. 50 years ago in the US, there was a bank in every major town that would have been based in that town. Interest rates on savings were over 1% in many of them too. Now its down to like four or five banks, and maybe some investment agencies. The interest you get is so low, and in return they benevolently claim that lending is easier, which it is. They want an economy where the average individual is reluctant to save. Only when money retains this dynamic, deprecating, and constantly liquid nature can they truly exploit the possibility of continuously using the Federal Reserves ability to print money; and this is how they stay on top of the rest of the world.


TLDR: The banking industry and the government are intertwined to the core, and any regulation they ""make"" or ""ease"" will eventually benefit the oligarchs.

"Most current wallets will never support LN. The amount of code needed to add support LN is greater than the amount of code that most current wallets have.

Most people will not like needing to keep their wallet online 24/7 in order to receive payments, so I expect custodial wallets will become somewhat popular. Of course, in order to run a custodial wallet, your custodian would need to have your private keys, which means you have to trust your custodian to not steal your money.

An alternative is to only connect your node when you are expecting to receive a payment. That's a very different UX from current wallets, though. You'd basically have to call anyone you wanted to pay who does this before you could pay them in order to ask them to turn on their wallet. Kinda like delivering rent to your landlord in person rather than leaving it in their mailbox. 

Alternately, you could rent a server in the cloud to be your 24/7 wallet. However, if you do this, you'd better choose a reputable VPS provider, since your LN wallet needs to have your private keys in memory at all times in order to participate in LN. This means that your cloud hosting provider could probably steal your money if they're savvy enough and ethically compromised. With unpatched bugs like Meltdown and Spectre, your money could be stolen even by another unprivileged client on the same server.";8;2;False;jtoomim;dvspk8r;After countless late nights, lines of code, bug fixes, and memes...

"Not an expert, but I think it would be like this:

Wallet will show your two accounts: onChain balance (the one we know) and LN Balance.

You will be able to transfer btc between those two accounts, it will take some confirmations (let's say 1 hour). You pay relatively expensive onchain fees.

You go to the merchant site or POS and you'll be shown a QR code (or RFID)

The wallet will detect if the QR is onChain or LN, it will check if you have enough balance in the corresponding account and display a prompt to approve the transaction. If it is a LN transaction you pay cheap fees and is instant (merchant immediately receives LN balance)

If you want to receive bitcoin, your wallet will ask you if you want to receive them onChain or on LN.  LN will be instant.

Something like 10-20% of drug sales in the UK are going through DNMs, according to an article I read a while ago. Even the DNMs that allow Monero immediately convert it into BTC upon deposit. Not sure what those numbers are like in the rest of the world but it's at least a few billion in sales every year. There're also a fair number of gambling sites that target Korea and Japan who accept deposits in BTC. Might not be something people like to talk about, but if there's a real-use case for BTC that's not going away, it's people using it to buy drugs and gamble.

While that is one good reason to run a node, that is not the only reason. 

A second reason to be online and monitoring a LN channel is so that you can receive a payment via that channel. In an old-school unidirectional payment channel, the recipient does not usually need to sign an off-chain transaction, but in the bidirectional channels of LN, the [recipient *does* sign a transaction upon receipt](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/understanding-the-lightning-network-part-building-a-bidirectional-payment-channel-1464710791/).

Of course users could lose money. The code did not use a deterministic seed so you would have to backup the wallet after each transaction. There were breaking changes after you had to close all the channels (and paying the mining fees). I used lnd on testnet and after closing the channels and upgrading the code,  some funds were not returned and I couldn't figure out how to get the funds. After spending a few hours I gave up and nuked the wallet as the testnet coins are worthless. I'm still unsure if the funds were recoverable or lost.

So, one person told you that or did you read about people that have been told by one person? Bitcoin has and always should be a payment method. Lightning is an extra layer to provide a means of using it on a larger scale and with small payments without fees getting out of hand. ;3;0;False;MikeLittorice;dvshxgr;After countless late nights, lines of code, bug fixes, and memes...

"> why should I pay with bitcoin?

You shouldn't, except when it's cheaper / more convenient than the alternatives, or there are none.

Other than that, there's no reason to use something as a means of payment that has a very real possibility to explode in value. Better use the money you know for sure devalues over time.";7;0;False;supermari0;dvshbr4;After countless late nights, lines of code, bug fixes, and memes...

"The consensus was as far as I remember that it's primarily used as a store of value and due to the scaling issues on chain,  a offchain scaling solution like lightning would restore and improve it's ability to be used for common payments for everyone. The fact is that a 1mb block limit is not enough for the entire world to use it. That's a fact. So a solution like bigger blocks or offchain scaling is needed. Bitcoin chose offchain scaling and Bitcoin Cash chose bigger blocks. It's up to you to decide which you want to use. 

I don't understand though, if you don't want to use it at all, why are you here?

"You know, it does sound like routing through the network is hard;

I know this sounds simplistic, but could we just ask people to have in the name an (x,y) location for routing? Just if where you want to go is northeast of you, go northeast?

And encourage people to make 4+ connections in different directions. 

And if you have a bigger channel, encourage people to make ""long"" jumps.

Now I'm starting to think that you should have North/South/East/West channels, and ""distance"" be the amount of bitcoin in the channel. So the other end will ""stick"" or make a channel with someone, if they're reliable, and if they're approximately large channels too, and if they are in approximately the right place.

"This article is posted by a well-known troll, and doesn't even *slightly* resemble a ""mathematical proof"" as it claims to. It has been debunked numerous times, but it's important to realize that the ""can anyone debunk this?"" question is a bit like asking: ""Can anyone debunk the claim that Bitcoin is just one big Ponzi scheme?"" Yes, we can, and plenty of people have done so in plenty of different ways, but the question itself is generally indicative of either trolling or severe ignorance (so it's generally frowned upon).

In any case, see the following for a few examples of rebuttals/debunkings:

* [Simulating a Decentralized Lightning Network with 10 Million Users](https://hackernoon.com/simulating-a-decentralized-lightning-network-with-10-million-users-9a8b5930fa7a); this piece alone is definitive, because it demonstrates empirically that Fyookball's ""proof"" is anything but.

* [Murch's response](https://medium.com/@murchandamus/i-have-just-read-jonald-fyookballs-article-https-medium-com-jonaldfyookball-mathematical-fd112d13737a), which explains how broken the argument is *before you even bother looking at any math*

As Murch once excellently put it: ""Consider this anology: We're discussing airplane designs for optimal transport capacity per fuel usage. Fyookball presents his model, an omnibus. He complains that his math shows that the doubledecker bus doesn't fly at all. Would you check the math or critique the model?"" and later: ""Fyookball's article is useless because it builds a strawman and torches it.

">Atomic Multipath Payments (AMP) - allow large Lightning transactions to be divided into a series of smaller transactions as they’re sent over the Lightning Network, but in such a way that they’re automatically joined back together. The user sees only the total amount of the transaction, without needing to be aware that AMP is being used behind the scenes. AMPs also ease the mental burden of using channels, allowing a user to interpret their balance readily as the sum of balances in channels. This is made possible by the ability to send and receive an AMP-like payment over multiple channels, at both source or sink.
