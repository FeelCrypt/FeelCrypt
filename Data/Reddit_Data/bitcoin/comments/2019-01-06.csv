">A currency can be stable in its own right.

I have never seen a cryptocoin that's stable. If that was the case, we wouldn't be obsessed with bear/bull markets, pumps/dumps, or constantly convert BTC value to USD. 

Imagine you're a farmer, selling sheep. Would you sell your sheep for a fixed price of 0.1 BTC each, would you update the sheep BTC price _every hour_, or would you simply set the price to ""$400/ewe, paid in Bitcoins""?

>How about you open your closed mind to the fact that you might not always be right about everything?

The very fact that I'm involved with cryptocurrencies and have learned how they operate on the technical level, shows that I have an open mind. My current impression that I've been wrong and/or deluded all these years only reinforces that notion.

>You provide no logical or empirical support for your overconfident opinions. Can you substantiate any of them? Or are you just shitting in the wind?

Reality is my empirical support. Or perhaps I do not see the same world as you do?";1;1;False;rattie_ok;eddfflz;Whenever you doubt yourself, remember this guy.;ackua3;https://i.redd.it/hs9p8g3b6g821.jpg
"Fine.

> Only stablecoins tethered to ""stable"" currencies such as USD or EUR can be actually used as currency. 

Nothing you've said supports this fact. In fact, the mere fact that USD and EUR exist makes it obvious that a stable currency does NOT need to be tethered to another currency in order to be stable. A currency can be stable in its own right. 

> Saying otherwise is just closing your eyes to truth.

How about you open your closed mind to the fact that you might not always be right about everything?

> You could say, with usage, Bitcoin's price would stabilize. I'd say no.

And I could say bull shit always floats northward. But without any supporting evidence or logic, all you're doing is blowing smoke out your ass.

"(1) Some didn't agree with a protocol change, and now we have BCH-ABC and BCH-SV. Every time there's a non-agreement, we have a fork and a chain split. Basically free money if you don't want to keep the other side's coins.

(1a) Bitcoin does have it's own inflation due to mining. It's about 1-2% annually and slowly drops because of halving. It still remains to be seen if there will be any mining incentive once block reward drops to below 0.5 BTC.

(1b) Due to coin taint, imposed by our all-powerful law enforcement, you will always have UTXOs that are worth _less_ than others. Fungibility is a lost dream with Bitcoin the way it is now.

(2) It's divisibility depends on network fees, which constantly change. Theoretically, even if fees are 1 sat/byte, it's impossible to send less than about 200 satoshis, so that's your minimal division. Two and a half decimal places lost right at the start. As usage grows, there's more and more pressure on the tiny 1MB blocks, therefore fees skyrocket. It's impossible to put world population in an elevator, the waiting line will span across the globe. You will have only 2 - 3 effective decimal places; everything below will be eaten up by fees. Would you pay $1000 to open and close a Lightning channel? I know I wouldn't. That's not how I imagined digital money to work.

(3) Yes. I write an email to my financial manager, saying to relay payment according to invoice 12345 XYZ. They connect with their bank which supports international RTGS, and transmit $1M to the receiver in Japan, who's bank also supports international RTGS payments.

(3a) Yes. I login to my PayPal account, paste email address of the recipient, and send that $50 away, instantly. I don't even have to pay any fees.

(3b) Yes. I open Venmo, WeChat, or Swish if I'm in Sweden, and send that $50 of fiat, instantly, with zero fees.

(4) Then why only 0.0001% of all employed people in the world get their wages in Bitcoin? Maybe because using Bitcoin is a legal nightmare for any company, so there's absolutely no incentive to use it.

And betting on something is still speculation, no?";4;2;False;rattie_ok;eddeohl;Whenever you doubt yourself, remember this guy.;ackua3;https://i.redd.it/hs9p8g3b6g821.jpg

    The four primary characteristics of money are: (1) durability, (2) divisibility, (3) transportability, and (4) noncounterfeitability.

For bitcoin:

(1) one bitcoin will forever remain one bitcoin. It won't wear, change or lose value due to inflation, unless we all agree to a change in the protocol.

(2) It is more divisible than any other money I am aware of. One satoshi is small enough that if bitcoin ever replaces all money (globally), the value of one satoshi would be approximately one US cent (which I believe  is not a coincidence).

(3) Can you teleport fiat across the planet in seconds by email?

(4) Bitcoin wins hands-down over any other form of money man has ever invented.

Sure, speculators probably make up a large part of the market right now. Bitcoins eventual value should be based on actual usefulness. But the potential is there, and many of us are betting on that.";2;1;False;phlogistonical;edc9lp7;Whenever you doubt yourself, remember this guy.;ackua3;https://i.redd.it/hs9p8g3b6g821.jpg
