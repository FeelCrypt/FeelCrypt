And yet you pay exchange fees... While I can withdraw cash from any ATM for $0 thanks to Schwab not having physical banks. Do you know banks' main source of revenue? Interest on loans that are based on minimum reserves. They use those reserves as a basis to borrow money from the fed at the fed funds rate and loan that money out to consumers at a marginally higher rate. It's aritrage.

First of all, hash rate is one part of the underlying tech: it's to build and maintain a permissionless ledger. And as others already pointed out: mining reward + tx fee and hash rate are in correlation. And secondly, price is in correlation to demand which is adoption.
