"Society is the imposition of a slight majority's will on an unwilling minority?

Fuck your 18th century quack-philosophy. That's simply law of the jungle bullshit, one order removed so that you can tell yourself you're civilized.

Society is based on the pursuit of actual consent of individuals, not the glorification of the unfortunate-but-necessary commons.  It is based on cooperation, not force. That's why English common law was more successful that the somewhat more collectivist continental legal systems: it, more than any other, enshrined the sanctity of the individual.

Its true that majoritarian rule is, for the foreseeable future, and in practice, going to have to be employed to govern over some commons, and that some commons will be unavoidable for now; at least work towards better voting mechanisms (like ranked or quadratic)...but quit celebrating that fact and enshrining that as a desirable or ideal thing...the civilised mindset is one which looks to free the individual, to every extent possible, from coercive and non-contractual relationships.

You've completely missed the whole point of bitcoin, if you don't even realize that that is exactly what it is, and what it is developing towards: it eschews majoritarian rule and is instead an opt-in/out relationship. It exists to provide individuals with options (you won't *have* to use your government fiat if bitcoin can develop into money); to allow those oppressed by majorities or dictators, to have some way of holding on to and transferring their wealth. *That* is society.";1;0;False;kwanijml;e5kfepx;When Bitcoin price dips but you're a HODLer;9ds6dr;https://v.redd.it/i3xjpl96yrk11

"[All substances are absorbed through the skin to some degree.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transdermal)  Fat cells have nothing to do with it, all skin uses lipids (aka fats) for its structure just to exist. Doesn't matter if it's your arm or your mouth.  You more easily absorb molecules in your mouth because you dont have as thick a layer of dead skin as it depends more on saliva and mucous membranes for protection.

Just a few puffs in the mouth is too low to mix the smoke with saliva to let it absorb. Ever notice tobacco chewers spit a lot? Besides being disgusting that's necessary to get the nicotine in contact with the skin in the mouth and allow the absorption to occur, otherwise chewing would be as effective putting a piece of tobacco on your arm. 

When I smoke a cigar I make a point to keep my lips and the cigar dry. If it gets moist from saliva my lips start tingling from the nicotine being absorbed, but it takes a while, a puff or two doesn't do it, and its not from the smoke.

Point is, just getting smoke in your mouth can theoretically get THC into your system, but in reality it will not get you high. You are getting high from slightly inhaling and from 2nd hand smoke in the air. If you can smell it you are inhaling it, and getting a larger dose than what would be absorbed from smoke in the mouth.";6;2;False;skiman13579;e5ki4m6;When Bitcoin price dips but you're a HODLer;9ds6dr;https://v.redd.it/i3xjpl96yrk11

"Dog the price is dropping because there are no more buyers. There are literally 100x as many traders as actual users of this stuff. Traders don't buy spot, and if they do it's gonna be at 5.9k in the near future not 7+. The retail investors that got into this to make money are all gone now. The HODLers are HODLing. The institutional investors aren't coming any time soon. There's no demand for Bitcoin. When there's no demand the price goes down!

Want the price to go up? There's really only a few things you can do (other than just directly dumping hundreds of millions of dollars into the spot market). One, you can help make Bitcoin better. Help develop wallets that dumb people can use and not lose all their money. Y'all realize that this stuff is unusable for stupid people right? Stupid people have money too. The other way is to just encourage adoption in general. When you sell something only accept Bitcoin. Support businesses that support Bitcoin (not the ones that instasell once you buy their stuff with BTC). Accept BTC as a payment at your business and offer a discount.

The last thing you can do is wait. Wait for people to give up and sell and the price to *really* hit rock bottom (we aren't close BTW), wait until all your nocoiner friends are laughing in your face, wait until the guy whose never used a financial instrument in his life is asking you how to short BTC. That's when the traders and institutional investors are gonna start turning into buyers. That's when there will be tons and tons of new demand. And as the price starts going up and up the retail investors all pile back in and create even more demand and we blast off.

The thing about futures is there was no way for institutions to short BTC before it, so they pump BTC up before futures, short, then dump the market to cash in on their shorts. It's an illiquid market and these things are going to happen. Gotta take the good with the bad and be patient and accept the market cycle.";34;0;False;SillyROI;e5jpf80;When Bitcoin price dips but you're a HODLer;9ds6dr;https://v.redd.it/i3xjpl96yrk11
