"WoW, thanks, todo be quite frankly with you i'll be using this money yo help people asking on the street, to give you an example this is what happens when you go out:

Yesterday I went to buy some bread and milk to the bakery, was there for probably 3 minutes and during that time 2 little kids approached me asking for food, bought them 4 ""pasteles"" and 2 orange juices and asked them to eat them right there in my view (some parents send their kids to ask for food then sell this food and buy drugs while their kids are starving...)

One week ago I went to eat junk food outside, was there for like one hour while my food was made and I ate. While being there:

1 old lady approached me sending condiments, I told her I really had no cash and had only brought my debit card, she looked really sad and told me ""that food looks really good, I haven't eaten anything today"" broke my heart, bought her a hot dog. (Didn't have anything healthy to give her at that hour sadly...)

3 little kids came to my table and told asked me if I could buy them food, that it could be anything, so I bought them some
.

1 old guy came to me and showed me some art in glass told me he does art in (don't really remember the name he gave me...), and that I could give it to my mom or girlfriend, told him I really had no cash to buy it and had only brought my debit card. He told me ""what about a trade?, Food for this?"" I told him fine but that I didn't want the art as it would be better for him to buy it from someone else , bought him a hot dog as well...

3 more people came, though they asked other people for food not me.

I was there only a while. Most people say no, that they can't help or give you food because they really aren't able to, minimum wage being like $10, a hot dog is worth like $0.5, a burguer like $1.

That old lady is the one who touched me the most, she didn't really ask for food out of shame, she was trying to make a living selling condiments, though nobody bought them from her.

"Here is one: Before Bitcoin, what do you think people would have judged the odds of a new disruptive alternative to fiat currencies?

Unless you're a multi-millionaire today, you didn't see the potential until late in the game. 

Now, consider that the same might happen again: Someone else may come up with an alternative that is just as much better.

But unlike fiat currencies which have trillions of dollars worth of trade channeled through them, Bitcoin has far less, and so would be far more vulnerable to a competing fiat alternative.

I'm not saying BTC will fail. I'm saying it *could* fail, by being disrupted by something even better. That something might even exist now but not get noticed, the same way most of us did not notice BTC until ""late"". 

That's not an argument against investing in BTC, btw. I'm still planning on putting more of my money into BTC. It's an argument for why there's still risk, and people need to consider their risk profile when deciding how much of their money they put in it (basically, the younger you are, the larger portion of your savings you can afford to risk - you have longer to recover if everything goes wrong)

"This is the classic ""Facebook vs MySpace"" argument, but it fails to address the fact that people don't simply give up on store of value systems, if they still store value. When was the last time you ever paid for anything in gold? Chances are, no one would even accept your gold unless you drastically overpay for it. Yet pretty much the only actual demand for gold today is for a speculative store of value (even jewelry, which is the main demand, carries this connotation because gold is expensive because it's gold). 

Also, it points to a non existent replacement, without pointing to what would make someone want to switch to it. In my mind, that's not rational. Sure, it's possible that there's some unknown physical phenomenon, conjuring in the universe, that could take us out tomorrow. But we don't operate our lives in fear that this would happen.

I don't grant anyone the ""something better can come along"" argument as rational because a) they don't identify what would make it better and b) even if it did, value would remain in bitcoin, it would simply just have a smaller portion of the value store market cap.

"> The difference between your 1994 example and bitcoin is that one was a method of transmittance for an asset, the other is the asset with a method of transmittance built in.

Something is only an asset if it can be exchanged. If I have a file sitting on my computer with some values on it that nobody wants, it is not an asset. If someone wants it badly enough to exchange something else for it, it is an asset. This idea that Bitcoin has some sort of inherent value beyond the trust that others will exchange it for something else is just flat out lunacy.

Yes, Bitcoin is more resilient against totally disappearing because of its distributed nature, but it's still vulnerable to huge drops in value if something replaces by providing more desirable functionality. It may never happen. It may happen next year. Determining the relative risks of that occurring is not possible, and hence risk assessments for BTC is incredibly hard. But that in itself does not mean the risk doesn't exist  but that our error margins in assessing it will necessarily be big.

>  The fact is, gold simply doesn't have a real industrial demand. Certainly not one that is inelastic to its price.

Firstly, I argued that it is *elastic* so thank you for agreeing with that. The point of elasticity in demand is that this means demand for industrial use can soak up a lot more supply than current use implies - it's just not attractive to use more *now* given current prices. The point is that this helps provide a floor that together with the trust in the ongoing demand for other uses provides a level of security that reduces risk. Bitcoin doesn't have that base demand - the entirety of its demand is tied to the ability to exchange it. That's fine - that's the same for fiat currencies no longer backed by gold too, and additionally subject to the whims of central banks, but it makes comparing BTC to gold meaningless.

> Risk is an entirely relative construct. Things are more risky than others, especially with temporal constraints, but ""bitcoin is risky"" is unsubstantiated FUD which again is not a substitute for logic. ""Bitcoin is volatile in relation to equity/other asset classes"" is a provable statement and thus, if your goal is short term gains, then your ""risk"" is entirely correlated with that volatility. But to just say ""bitcoin is risky"", with no relational constraints to that statement is pure FUD, and unless you have found a sha256 collision, is entirely unsubstantiated.

It is pretty obvious to anyone not intentionally trying to be obtuse that saying Bitcoin is risky is about evaluating the odds that it may lose value relative to the fiat currencies the vast majority of us gets our salaries in and pay for our food and housing in. That you choose to be confrontational for the sake of it doesn't change that, nor does it change the fact that we can talk about risk without mentioning specific currencies in most respects because most fiat currencies remain relatively stable relative to each other (yes, there are outliers) over relatively long periods of time. The fluctuations in USD, EUR, GBP for example hardly matters in this discussion even on a timeline of a couple of decades.

> No

Thank you for making my point.

>  because again, risk is related to temporal constraints. It doesn't exist in a vacuum

Nobody claimed it did. But feel free to continue arguing against this strawman position that nobody here is supporting.

> assuming development continues at the rate it is going, the risk is probably the lowest of any asset class. 

If you assume away risks you don't like, you can argue anything is low risk, but that defeats the point of managing risks.

In any case, you've conceded that there is still risk, which was my point in the first place, so I consider this discussion closed for my part.

"> Your logic here is circular. Of course bitcoin can have inherent value. You can not send me bitcoin, unless you somehow acquire bitcoin first. So as long as you can't just magically make bitcoin, outside of the consensus rules, it has scarcity.

That's not what inherent value means. That is extrinsic value. Inherent value implies that something has value *in and of itself*.  One might be a pedant and argue that this means nothing has inherent value as if there is nobody there to take advantage of it, but a more charitable interpretation is that inherent value implies that something has other uses than acting as an exchange token. Paper money has inherent value equal to the inherent value of the paper, because absent the ability to exchange it (its extrinsic value), it is just paper.

>  And being that it's mathematically limited scarcity makes it more absolutely scarce than literally anything on the planet, people will value it due to the scarcity. You are looking at it in reverse. People are valuing the scarcity.

Nonsense. Scarcity in itself means nothing unless people are prepared to exchange something else for it. I can extract a random sequence of numbers from an RNG right now that I can guarantee to a far higher degree of certainty than Bitcoin can will be unique, and that will take far more resources to brute force. It's easy - just generate enough random bits. But its value is no more than at most the cost of the resource use involved in generating a sufficiently long sequence of bits. 

Any value beyond that is down to its value as a means of exchange. If I manage to convince someone that I will pay them $10 dollars if they hand it back to me later, it's worth $10, but that's extrinsic value, and the value only remains as long as they have reason to believe that they can still exchange it.

> No, the demand is tied to your ability to absolutely park what is now universally becoming a specific segment of value, onto a random number in such a way that it is impossible to have it stolen from you. 

That only has value as long as someone is willing to honor it. The world is full of obsolete currencies that demonstrates well how low even the extrinsic value of currencies that still have some minor collectors value to maintain a limited value as a means of exchange can sink. 

> Your argument that gold has a baseline demand is what is giving it value is pointless. 

First of all, that is not what I said. What I said was that the baseline demand for gold contributes to the level of trust given to it. As does its many thousands of years of history. People know that even if the price drops, it's not likely to disappear in short order. Gold has inherent value because of useful properties, and extrinsic value as a means of exchange - its intrinsic value is *part* of what makes it attractive as a means of exchange.

> Sand has a baseline demand. Should we start storing value in sand?

Lots of value is stored in sand. But we shouldn't store more in sand because the demand for sand per unit of mass or volume is too low to make it practical. 

> Ummm, ya that's not your point, because your point implied short term constraints

No, it didn't.

> Yes you did. Bitcoin is ""risky"". In relation to what? Red or black? No. Cash? Short term or long term? If you aren't going to give any constraints, we can assume you have none, and you are saying it is as ""risky"" as literally anything else.

You could actually read the comments you reply to. Since you don't, let me quote myself:

> It is pretty obvious to anyone not intentionally trying to be obtuse that saying Bitcoin is risky is about evaluating the odds that it may lose value relative to the fiat currencies the vast majority of us gets our salaries in and pay for our food and housing in. 

> Again, you can't point to the unknown as a case against something. 

Of course you can. There are plenty of historical examples for why ""the unknown"" needs to account for a large risk factor. E.g. prior to the car, it'd be reasonable to assume a bright future for the manufacture of horse-carriages. Afterwards, not so much. The car was an unknown until it wasn't. 

> You have no reason to believe development would cease, so any decision you make based off of it ceasing would be irrational. 

Irrelevant - the risk is not that development would cease, but that it stops being sufficiently attractive as a means of exchange of value. If people move on to something else, the scarcity of your coins becomes meaningless.

> which is a fallacy,

And thus you demonstrate that you don't know what the word fallacy mean.

>  The plausibility of such a replacement should be considered any more of a risk than alien species wiping us all out with domesticated velociraptors, because there's absolutely no evidence of this happening, and is irrational.

Prior to the invention of the car there was no evidence that anything would displace horse-driven carriages, and yet anyone investing in their manufacture were acting irrationally if they did not account for some degree of risk of the unknown as the advent of the car proves that the risk of something unknown largely replacing it and bankrupting most of them was there.

"> Something is only an asset if it can be exchanged. If I have a file sitting on my computer with some values on it that nobody wants, it is not an asset. If someone wants it badly enough to exchange something else for it, it is an asset. This idea that Bitcoin has some sort of inherent value beyond the trust that others will exchange it for something else is just flat out lunacy.

Your logic here is circular. Of course bitcoin can have inherent value. You can not send me bitcoin, unless you somehow acquire bitcoin first. So as long as you can't just magically make bitcoin, outside of the consensus rules, it has scarcity. And being that it's mathematically limited scarcity makes it more absolutely scarce than literally anything on the planet, *people will value it* due to the scarcity. You are looking at it in reverse. People are valuing the scarcity. 

> Yes, Bitcoin is more resilient against totally disappearing because of its distributed nature, but it's still vulnerable to huge drops in value if something replaces by providing more desirable functionality.

Again, never said it couldn't drop in value in the short term, and *you can't simply point to the unknown as a valid argument against it*. You need to point to a specific example, otherwise, there's no rational reason to worry about it. Unknown is not a substitute for logic. By that thought, all religions can be proved real, because you can't prove them untrue without knowing. But in doing so, because all religions claim to be the only true religion, they would all disprove themselves. It simply breaks down. Unknowns are not replacements for logic. 

> It may never happen. It may happen next year. Determining the relative risks of that occurring is not possible, and hence risk assessments for BTC is incredibly hard. But that in itself does not mean the risk doesn't exist  but that our error margins in assessing it will necessarily be big.

Something something unsubstantiated FUD, unknowns, and ""risk"" with no relative gauge point. 

> Firstly, I argued that it is *elastic* so thank you for agreeing with that. The point of elasticity in demand is that this means demand for industrial use can soak up a lot more supply than current use implies - it's just not attractive to use more *now* given current prices. The point is that this helps provide a floor that together with the trust in the ongoing demand for other uses provides a level of security that reduces risk. Bitcoin doesn't have that base demand - the entirety of its demand is tied to the ability to exchange it. That's fine - that's the same for fiat currencies no longer backed by gold too, and additionally subject to the whims of central banks, but it makes comparing BTC to gold meaningless.

No, the demand is tied to your ability to absolutely park what is now universally becoming a specific segment of value, onto a random number in such a way that it is impossible to have it stolen from you. Your argument that gold has a baseline demand is what is giving it value is pointless. Sand has a baseline demand. Should we start storing value in sand?

> It is pretty obvious to anyone not intentionally trying to be obtuse that saying Bitcoin is risky is about evaluating the odds that it may lose value relative to the fiat currencies the vast majority of us gets our salaries in and pay for our food and housing in.

""Bitcoin is more risky on a short term basis than fiat"". Sure. I would agree with such a statement. Thank you for applying constraints. Bitcoin is a terrible replacement for cash at the moment, so keeping any amount of value in it expecting it to be immediately liquid would be stupid. That isn't the argument. Stocks are riskier than bonds. Does that mean we paint the entire stock market as ""risky""? No because it's even more risky, over a long enough time period to store your money in bonds, while the market and inflation zoom past you. Ask anyone on a fixed income. Again, ""risk"" means nothing in a vacuum. 

> That you choose to be confrontational for the sake of it doesn't change that, nor does it change the fact that we can talk about risk without mentioning specific currencies in most respects because most fiat currencies remain relatively stable relative to each other (yes, there are outliers) over relatively long periods of time. The fluctuations in USD, EUR, GBP for example hardly matters in this discussion even on a timeline of a couple of decades.

Ok bud. I'm tired of beating a dead horse. Risk is relative. Bottom line. Risk doesn't exist in a vacuum. 

> Thank you for making my point.

Ummm, ya that's not your point, because your point implied short term constraints, which obviously bitcoin is not conducive to at the moment. But does that make bitcoin comparable on the risk scale to going to a casino and putting money on red or black? Again, something something risk is relative. I will bet you $1 every single day that bitcoin will be worth more than $2000 tomorrow. Willing to take that bet? Why not? If bitcoin is ""risky"" without any relative constraints, and gambling is ""risky"" without any constraints, wouldn't that mean it's a safe bet? Something something risk is relative. 

> Nobody claimed it did. But feel free to continue arguing against this strawman position that nobody here is supporting.

Yes you did. Bitcoin is ""risky"". In relation to what? Red or black? No. Cash? Short term or long term? If you aren't going to give any constraints, we can assume you have none, and you are saying it is as ""risky"" as literally anything else. In other words, it's relative risk to everything, it is ""riskier"". If you have no baseline, other than ""it is risky"" then your base case for the argument is that losing everything is always imminent in nature. I would argue it's the exact opposite for bitcoin. 

> If you assume away risks you don't like, you can argue anything is low risk, but that defeats the point of managing risks.

Again, you can't point to the unknown as a case against something. You have no reason to believe development would cease, so any decision you make based off of it ceasing would be irrational. It's certainly plausible that an alien species comes into our world tomorrow, turns us into slaves and kills the entire development team using their domesticated velociraptors, but it is highly unlikely. Something something risk is relative. 

Bottom line, you have done absolutely nothing to point to a valid/logical reason as to why bitcoin would crumble, other than point to the unknown, which is a fallacy, and directly supports my original claim. The plausibility of such a replacement should be considered any more of a risk than alien species wiping us all out with domesticated velociraptors, because there's absolutely no evidence of this happening, and is irrational.

So I'll just say this: as the code stands now, you can't divide Bitcoin infinitely. Hence the term satoshi. The smallest unit of account in the Bitcoin protocol. 

But you're missing the forest for the trees. If you have a gold bar and you cut it in half, you don't have twice as much gold or twice as much value. You have the same amount of gold. Dividing it infinitely while possible doesn't make more gold.

the idea is 21 million *whole* bitcoins can be mined. the smallest fraction of a whole bitcoin is currently 1 satoshi.  this limit is determined by the bit-width of the number used to store a bitcoin. expand that bit-width and that smallest fraction goes down.  it could still be called satoshi or renamed to something else.  this smallest fraction is the actual unit of exchange in the bitcoin world. therefore 21 million bitcoins is not the limit as everyone thinks. in fact it can expand indefinitely - by expanding in the *opposite* direction!;6;1;False;jagbot;dorhs90;Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak: “Bitcoin is mathematical.

Thank you for taking your time to share your concern. In my case there is no need to worry concerning savings, I've got enough and won't touch that. On the other hand side, I live in Switzerland and even though living costs are exorbitant over here, and I can only work part time, I'm currently making a lot more money than possibly most people over in Venezuela. And it seems to be very unhumalny dire over there, that hurts. By giving this person some bitcoin, I might be able to at least provide some meals for some, with knowing it's directly going to a person which is involved, without any middleman, approvals and still very much in time.

"> First of all it would be a 10000% return not 100 000 

You're right, I missed the decimal. But really, 10000% or 100000%, same point, which you're missing. I'm not arguing whether bitcoin will hit $500k. What I'm saying is that if it *does*, your scenario is you take those earnings and put them into *another* investment that has a similar ROI. A 10000% ROI is a once in a lifetime thing, doing that *twice* is just not going to happen.

> Also if you invest half a Million with 20% you will have in 15 years a fortune.

Again you missed the point. 20% is a ridiculously good ROI and you can't expect that for one year, let alone fifteen. People seem to lose sight of that in the bitcoin bubble. A more realistic ROI is 7% real or 10% nominal. See - https://www.thebalance.com/good-rate-roi-357326

"> This is the classic ""Facebook vs MySpace"" argument, but it fails to address the fact that people don't simply give up on store of value systems, if they still store value. 

It only still stores value if people as long as people accept them.  My first online payments was with some micropayment platform that stopped existing in 1994. Lots of digital payment platforms have ceased to exist. More than the number of prominent crypto-coins today. It's true that none of them gained the prominence of Bitcoin, and so it would take much more for Bitcoin to falter in the same way. 

But that is not the point: The point is that BTCs value is dependent on its continued acceptance. The ""stored value"" of BTC if nobody accepts it as payment is exactly 0.

>  Yet pretty much the only actual demand for gold today is for a speculative store of value (even jewelry, which is the main demand, carries this connotation because gold is expensive because it's gold).

While that's true to an extent, about 15% of the current demand for gold is for industrial uses and dentistry. 

The big difference is that those 15% represents a lower barrier and would soak up a lot of supply if prices drop (e.g. gold would be used as a corrosion free conductor in many more places is it was cheaper). It would still drop, but still represent a massive risk reduction.

Beyond that it is a matter of trust: Gold has thousands of years of history as something that has demand, and *because* of that history of demand it has remained a popular store of value. 

Once BTC has a few thousands of years of history of ongoing demand, *and* someone has somehow found another use for BTC that provides a floor that prevents a total wipeout, we can make this comparison. As of now, it is laughable.

> Also, it points to a non existent replacement, without pointing to what would make someone want to switch to it. In my mind, that's not rational. 

It's entirely rational. The point is exactly that the risks are unknown. We can't quantify it, but that does not mean the risks don't exist - in fact that makes them more problematic. BTC itself is a demonstration of how a threat to BTC could gain prominence

>  it would simply just have a smaller portion of the value store market cap.

... and that is exactly the argument: it's poses a risk to Bitcoin investments. 

The entire point of managing investments is managing risk vs. reward. Not acknowledging the risks is irresponsible. That does not mean you shouldn't invest in BTC, but it does mean that you need to account for the risks realistically and consider how it affects your overall investment strategy, because it affects your expected long term returns and e.g. how you rebalance your investments. 

To put it another way: Have you remortgaged your house to invest everything in Bitcoin? 

If you haven't, why not? 

The rational answer is that there are risks, and we don't know precisely how big they are.

Before you do anything, you really need to consider the *real* possibility of losing money, and whether you can handle that.

Are you ready to go down with this ship (i.e., you believe in what bitcoin stands for as you see it) or you just trying to make a quick buck or what?

"1: Diversification is good

"> Tell me why I shouldn't sell all of my shares of stock right now and go into crypto. We're on the verge of a revolution.

Other people have hit the diversification point, but there's another point that hasn't been raised. Stocks are ownership in companies that are creating things, and their value comes from the things that the companies create (or are expected to create in the future) rather than just the expectation that other people are going to want them more in the future. Bitcoin doesn't inherently create anything. It's value comes from scarcity, ease of trade, and a set of unbreakable rules about how it is created and exchanged. For bitcoin to be worth anything we still need to have people creating goods and services to exchange it for, and that's where stocks come in.

Now, I wouldn't put any money into bonds or other investments vehicles that are denominated in dollars. If the dollar crashes and bitcoin takes over, bonds will still be paid back in dollars. Stocks will continue to be a share in a company, so as long as the company you hold stock in survives the turmoil you'll still own your stake in the company. Some companies probably wouldn't survive a major crash, but that's where diversification comes in. 

The other thing to consider: I don't know how closely you've followed quantum computing, but it's made some significant strides in the last few years, and if it continues at this pace some of the important math behind modern crypto currencies falls apart.

Imho, a good way to help in Venezuela is to spread information about bitcoin or cryptocurrency to raise awareness that it is in no way illegal, because the goverment is prosecuting miners under ridiculous reasons such as terrorism or power theft when in reality they just want to extort and steal them all they have and ruin their lives in prison.

"To be honest I can't think of a way to further help, reducing the fees was already huge for us. Localbitcoins is a blessing, I made the calculations on how many fees we pay a few days ago:

Bitcoin was 6007.92 oficial, buy bitcoins $5618.71505 (traders sell Bitcoin at this price), sell $5920.392

Prices are quite good.

If you want to donate then then that's good help if you donate to a small group of people who use this money to help the poor. I don't know about instructing the poor though, these people are starving, so they wouldn't have the state of mind to understand or retain this information. 

Helping people who are able to eat at least to not starve would be good for that, but with so many people starving I think help is needed on another front.

If there was a foundation or something of the like, and if the wrong people found out that foundation has a location, and that they use bitcoin, being the retard thugs that they are they would look up Bitcoin, see it is worth $6000, think the foundation has dozens and thus has millions of dollars and they would then kidnap or do something really bad to the people in it.";3;0;False;randomizerdude;dorqgyy;Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak: “Bitcoin is mathematical.

I use one of them for my SIPP (pensions... yes, I'm crazy enough to bet on Bitcoin for my pension; some of it anyway) as it gives we very beneficial tax treatment. 

EDIT: Do your damn research before investing in these: For XBT you're investing in a Swedish fund denominated in Swedish Kroner or Euro - in either case unless those are your ""native"" currencies, you're compounding the currency risk of Bitcoin with the currency risk of SEK/EUR, and then on top of that you're depending on XBT not turning out to shady. It does add risk over ""just"" owning Bitcoin. The upside is as I mentioned that you (depending on your country) may be able to put pensions or other tax advantageous savings into them (e.g. in the UK SIPP for pensions, or ISA's for tax free returns; though the specific funds above can not currently be used for ISA's)
