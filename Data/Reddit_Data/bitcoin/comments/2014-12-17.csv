"> The destruction communism has caused FOR THE VERY PEOPLE IT CLAIMS TO HELP is unmatched.

I repeat this again. The US government is certainly responsible for massive destruction and the deaths of millions. I do not support that. But, the US government also is not pretending to serve those people.

Communist regimes can't even help the people at home, who have starved, been murdered, or sentenced to slave labor in the tens of millions.

I concede you are correct. But the massive corruption in the system is a bad thing and many of us suffer for it. And I believe that as the corruption and manipulation of the system by the elite rich over the poor may threaten its very existence. (there is a saying, which goes: Every institution tends to fail from an excess of its very own principals. i fear that capitalism may become one such institution);1;0;False;superfusion1;cmx7txk;My Russian friend sent me this joke;2pb2ku;https://i.imgur.com/k3odZjv.jpg

But that's just talking about the US. The World Bank is talking about all of humanity. A common explanation for the reduction in world poverty is that due to increases in global trade, capital and wealth are starting to even out a bit by transferring some of the wealth from western nations into the third world. In my opinion, that's a good thing. We just need to start looking at humanity as a whole, rather than just our own nations. ;1;1;False;lookingatyourcock;cmx27xx;My Russian friend sent me this joke;2pb2ku;https://i.imgur.com/k3odZjv.jpg
But objectively, the poor in third world nations are MUCH worse off than the poor in first world nations. I think if more people bothered to look at the economy on a global scale, they would agree that this trend is good. The difference in opinion has more to do with the scale of their perspective, and differences in knowledge. Most people don't even know that the third world is benefiting from the transfer of wealth. Bad news sells newspapers, not good news. ;1;2;False;lookingatyourcock;cmx3zhn;My Russian friend sent me this joke;2pb2ku;https://i.imgur.com/k3odZjv.jpg
"Hmm. I want to thank you for that viewpoint. You need to be very careful to see through the propaganda. It seems that other organizations don't agree with the worldbank. For example, the report from National Poverty Center  says that extreme poverty INCREASED by 160% from 1996 to 2011.

"Due to bank failures during the 2008/2009 bank crisis, the FDIC fund fell to $0.648 billion by August of 2009. Subsequent bank failures almost bankrupted the FDIC, so it demanded a 3 year pre-payment from banks to shore up its capital.

In using the term underfunded I was not referring to the official $25 billion kept reserved. I was just trying to say that $25 billion is not enough.

"Ahahaahaha.

Tell that to Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, or even Russia. [2/3rds of Russians don't have a negative view of communism.](http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/why-russians-still-dont-hate-communism-9294) Just look at bulgarian unemployment rates if you want to see how capitalism is working out for them. Yugoslavia had a very high standard of living compared to their Eastern Bloc counterparts and were able to sustain consumer good production with democratic control until they fell apart due to nationalist movements and CIA intervention. Nowadays Yugoslavia doesn't even exist.

Sure, there were famines and deplorable standards of living in The early Soviet Union, but after the brief famine of 1947, caused by drought and war damage, there never was another famine. Literacy Rates also became some of the highest in the world and unemployment was eliminated. The fact is every economic system, from feudalism to capitalism, took huge amounts of lives to implement them. The Bourgeois French Revolution had it's own Terror, several famines, took several tries to implement capitalism, and led to one of the world's greatest wars, but we don't blame capitalism for it.";0;1;False;yuy168;cmx6hyx;My Russian friend sent me this joke;2pb2ku;https://i.imgur.com/k3odZjv.jpg
"Wow such argument. I don't support Stalin's actions. By your standards, saying that absolves me of all guilt for supporting the ideology. The soviet union went from peasants to cosmonauts in 30 years. No other country in the world has ever had such rapid growth and improvement in history. Innocent girls in 60s Soviet Russia would have been FORCED to get a college education or vocational training so they could become doctors, chemists, or scientists. Thank you comrade Gorbachev, for giving her the choice between freedom and prostitution. Russian GDP has only recovered to it's soviet levels in the past few years, and with recent news it's on it's way back down.

The facts remain is that [huge amounts of people from the Soviet Union](http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/v2_article_large/public/2014/03/21/soviet1-01_0.png?itok=3_bqgJYz) see it's destruction has harmful and that number is on the rise.

"Sorry for the late reaction but I needed some time think about this. 

Capitalism works at this moment. But the outputs are completely skewed in our current system. Which undermines functioning markets that can take care of everybody. 

After more than 100 years of capitalism we have the inverse situation then were we started. Resources have become much scarcer, while money and labour are plenty available. Every person that is unemployed forms a supply of labour at this moment. However our tax laws have not adapted to this situation. We tax labour, while there's enough labour to go around. There's almost no tax on resources, while these are getting more scarce. It would be better to adapt this to the current situation. 

Capitalism does nothing on resource flows currently. It only handles the allocation on materials based on: This is what I have and this is the price. With the end goal of creating more profit. Which is actually a very information poor environment. This works in an environment where a lot of material is available and labor is scarce.  
Something like the 19th century. 

This kind of crude system worked better than feudalism and central planning because there was more competition possible. The products weren't that complex.  
Now during the 2nd half of the 20th century, the high margin products have become much more complex and you see automatic oligopoly forming. Just look at the car, smartphone and tablet market. Only a couple of players are left. These companies earn much more than other commodity makers and people rather invest in these companies. 

Also the profit motive creates 'externalities' which makes sure some aspects in the real world will be left behind.  These currently translate in poor working condition in the 3rd world, climate change, resource scarcity, hunger, forced prostitution, pollution, financial crashes, diseases, lack of education, etc. 

At the moment Capitalism is working really good at amassing more money into the rich peoples pockets, which then can buy the government they need. Add to this the complete financial industry, which means creating money using money on a global market. Thus extracting wealth from the real world via inflation. With their investments they also direct which products will be made and that necessarily doesn't mean that will be the products that people need most.  These markets have become completely disfunctional and fallen prey to speculators. See the food riots and Arabic spring that resulted from increasing oil prices. In the first world you see that the money goes to other rent seekers and not to companies that actually produce something usefull. 

This results in a complete disaster for the people who don't have much capital. 

In order to get the smokeless cooking stoves, you would actually need a good market that could make them and people that earned money to invest in them. 

To create these markets we could adjust the playing field to our current predicament. 

* Design an open source smokeless cooking stove to make it interesting for multiple parties to build and distribute these. 
* There's enough labour available but it's taxed too high so it's cheaper to automate, so tax this less. 
* Tax capital and resources more. So more money will be invested in people, instead of capital goods or financial investments. 

This would make it more affordable to make and distribute the smokeless cooking stove and make sure that enough will be build. This will also give a boost towards a circular economy that recycles it's used resources. However exponential innovation in automation will still offset these measures in the end. But it would do in the mean time.

Sorry for the long rant.

tl;dr: Capitalism works to create profit for few nowaday. Could work somehat if we change the rules wrt. resources, profit and available labour.";1;0;False;jhaand;cmxmm2t;My Russian friend sent me this joke;2pb2ku;https://i.imgur.com/k3odZjv.jpg
I read through what's posted there, and honestly, my opinion has only fallen (if that's possible).

The fact that wealth is transferring out of western countries to others may be a good thing, IN YOUR OPINION, but its not good for the poor and middle-class of those western countries, whose wealth and net worth is decreasing. So you see, its not a one size fits all, or rather one fact is correct for all the world. Its good for some, but bad for others. Personally, I've seen my wages drop. I used to make more money 10 years ago. That's bad for me. So its great that the world is less poor, but that really doesn't matter to me and my family. I'm not the only one with that opinion.
