"Okay, you need to check out this: https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/volume/24-hour/

And this: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/

BTC may be overpriced if it was a stock. As a currency, it's doing pretty well. High trade volume ($BILLIONS per day). $175 BIL market cap.

BTC has no choice but to become more valuable since it's already 3/4 of the way through its theoretical maximum supply.

A Satoshi is still worth under a penny, making Bitcoin fractions feasible for any kind of transaction, not just banking and investment transactions: https://99bitcoins.com/satoshi-usd-converter/

I think there is a big bubble from the standpoint of your average consumer. I am waiting to see how serious investors react to BTC's price. The problem with seeing BTC as a bubble, even though I think it *should* be a bubble, is there is no reason to sell it.

But you can. It's pretty easy to. Plenty of people have made $100k's+ converting their BTC to USD. I have held a good number of BTC in the past, and I am telling you from experience, when you actually own it for a while as opposed to just looking at the hype charts, you just aren't super convinced by the need to convert to USD.

I sold out of necessity. I needed the cash and my portfolio was small. If I had a larger portfolio, it's possible I may have gotten a car, a house or hired services with BTC at this point... but really, like many others, I would just hold.

If you invested in BTC even earlier this year, you'd be up so significantly that even a major, major crash in BTC's value would still most likely leave you up a significant amount. That's the scary part, though... Most people buying BTC are gambling, not investing. So there is a bubble. However, there's no telling if it will ever pop.";7;1;False;TheAdventMaster;dqhugq9;It's official! 1 Bitcoin = $10,000 USD;7g9cd3;https://v.redd.it/e7io27rdgt001

"Think about this. Everyday more services are starting to accept bitcoins. I myself buy games from Microsoft store with bitcoins because my credit card doesn't work there and I'm not comfortable putting my credit card in there either. Now wall street is getting involved. The total number of bitcoins that can be mined is fixed. The more the demand, the higher the price hike. So the price hike definitely makes some sense.

That said, i agree with you. yes making btc your only investment would not be smart. And since it is unregulated market, keeping your btc in exchanges isn't either, for all you know they're going to get hacked and it'll be an inside job. Where there is a ton of people who is merely buying it out of speculation, and without knowing where bitcoin's value lies, bitcoin has massive potential to change the world economy.

"Ideally, yes - bitcoin and other cryptos will be used independently from fiat. Say you have 10 BTC m which is valued at x. You have no income in dollars. 99% of your wealth is in coins. You need to buy groceries. Do you exchange and spend dollars or do you find food you can buy with bitcoin? How does the money flow? Everything has a value.-The food, the dollar, the bitcoin. But fiat value is solely based on supply and demand. And that demand is tied to the trust in the US government and federal reserve.  BTC value is based on the supply and demand but that is tied to proof (block chain).

E-commerce is currently way better for cryptos because of the delay in transaction time but I see room in the market for any business including brick and mortar to accept BTC.

"Yes, you can exchange this for fiat/usd (subject to capital gains tax). If you want to avoid tax I would recommend purchasing goods like gold, cars or even a holiday. 

Think of it kind of like today's modern piggy bank. Most people are now realizing they can store their wealth there, transfer it anywhere across the world or p2p without bank interference. Mark Cuban, Sir Richard Branson and many more billionaires (with wallstreet coming up) are getting invested.

The value of this will most likely increase after a short dip, so if you want to make more money off of it, just cash out a small portion of it. The price of Bitcoin may double before Q2 2018 so it's up to you how much profits you want to take.

As mentioned, look into obtaining the coins safely and storing them securely like in a hardware wallet or paper wallet.

What you're looking at is a chart of who is selling/buying bitcoin at what price. 

Imagine all the people on the left in green are yelling ""I'll buy Bitcoin at 200 bucks a bitcoin"" and all the people on the right in red are yelling ""I'll sell bitcoin at 300 billion bucks a bitcoin.""  Obviously, neither side is going to get that deal, so their orders/offers remain undone, but still available as offers if the price of bitcoin actually does make it to one of those levels.

"**Agorism**

Agorism is a libertarian social philosophy that advocates creating a society in which all relations between people are voluntary exchanges by means of counter-economics, thus engaging with aspects of peaceful revolution. It was first proposed by libertarian philosopher Samuel Edward Konkin III at two conferences, CounterCon I in October 1974 and CounterCon II in May 1975, both conferences organized by J. Neil Schulman.

At the same time people need to see it as having some measurable value. The trouble is that it's a finite commodity and people tend to hoard those like precious metals. No one buys anything with pure silver even though everyone agrees it has value (measured in fiat, no less) and is easier to verify and exchange than crypto. Bitcoin is very volatile right now due to this speculation. Once this levels off people can start using it as a currency.;10;2;False;soup2nuts;dqho4j5;It's official! 1 Bitcoin = $10,000 USD;7g9cd3;https://v.redd.it/e7io27rdgt001
"I think this is incorrect because most coins are being held in ""deep storage"" and haven't moved in a long time. This is public knowledge since the blockchain is a public ledger. There is a profit incentive of course, but for the people who believe in the fundamentals it isn't a ""quick"" one.

It is good to isolate criticisms of bitcoin to see if they hold weight. Any criticism of bitcoin that can also be levied against gold is essentially a criticism against a ""store of value"" which is an asset that is basically a hedge against the traditional monetary system.

Other criticisms of bitcoin are roundabout logic like: Bitcoin is too volatile to be useful. That's only true while it is growing and not successful. So you are assuming bitcoin won't be successful because it isn't currently successful.

Having a non confiscatable asset that can be sent in a borderless fashion to anywhere in the world with a multitude of versatile storage options and the programmatic aspect which brings layers of ""use cases"" on top of that is pretty hard to beat. It is simply better than gold at doing what gold does.";3;0;False;lumenium;dqi5apc;It's official! 1 Bitcoin = $10,000 USD;7g9cd3;https://v.redd.it/e7io27rdgt001

"It doesn’t need to be *just* a currency.  It can also be a store of value like gold.  These aren’t mutually exclusive.  In the sense that it can already be used to buy a lot more stuff than gold in a real world situation, I’d say it’s better than gold.  And that’s not even counting its other advantages - portability, anonymity, transferability, etc.  IMO, its market valuation should be at least gold’s ($7.8 trillion) if not more.  

If and when Lightning Network is successfully implemented, I can see it eventually being a very useful form of travel currency and I would venture to guess that there will be widespread acceptance in places with high numbers of international tourists.  SE Asia would be prime.

Smart contracts would then take Bitcoin to the next level.  This is the thing that most people haven’t really wrapped their minds around.  Bitcoin is upgradeable.

"No way, the primary use is for underground markets to transfer hundreds of millions of dollars to anywhere on earth with anonymity.

I find it funny that bitcoin found its early niche in darknet markets and illegal activity for buying drugs.

It has now grown into the *real* illegal activity, which is moving stupid amounts of money around the world.

Bitcoin will never be used to buy a cup of coffee, as we all like to dream.  It will be used every time you hear in the news that Paul Manafort had over $212M hiding in Russia; it will be used every time a corporation wants to move their overseas revenues back home domestically without paying 30% in taxes.  It would have been an ideal choice during the Nixon era programs to help receive money from the Saudis in secret in exchange for protection, had bitcoin existed then, and these types of programs are still happening around the world.

There are also very legitimate uses, happily operating within Uncle Sam's vision; Wall St loves bitcoin.  Particularly the commodities exchanges are really growing into it.  Even the banks, you'd think they'd shun bitcoin, on the contrary they have many analysts publicly pouring praise for it.  They are regularly brokering deals with huge amounts of money and paying big % transaction fees on them.  Bitcoin fees are cheap.

Think about it; how else could you possibly send someone $100,000,000 in secret to anywhere on earth within 10 minutes, secure without fraud or theft during transit?  Have a guy board a plane with a briefcase full of money?  Wire it through different banks on the books?  Exchange your country's currency for theirs?



Bitcoin's primary use is just getting started, and in order to support this new niche, it needs to grow even further.

"You need to know the risk. BitCoin (and other crypto currencies) are at the moment full of speculators that are buying with the hopes of selling later at profit.

That's great, until it's not. BitCoin already had a number of ""corrections"" (rapid drops). Yes it's always regained ground, but it's not necessarily the same people people. IE, there are going to be people that bought high and sold low losing money.

Yes, you can buy BitCoin. And yes, it may go up in value and Horrah! profit. Just realise it might also go down in value at which point you need to either consider cutting your loses or holding out until it recovers.

Lastly like all crypto's there is that idea of ""it's only worth things whilst people give it value"". That's true of any currency, but typically a countries currency is a more ""real world"" item. If the entire population decided BitCoin is worth nothing, it would be.

Just be very cautious when setting up a wallet. Make sure your computer has been scanned for viruses or spyware, and id even recommend disconnecting from the internet when you create your Electrum wallet to be extra cautious.

If a nation has a single currency and people no longer trust the currency then long term investments in that currency cease and will seek goods. The price of goods will rise rapidly compared to that currency.   
When quality metal coins were made, they started trading for value above their metal content - we never got to see how this played out because kings / states imediety took control of mints and rapidly debased the quality metal coin.

There's hundreds more great start-ups and hundreds more which will just fail and/or could quite accurately be called a ponzi.

">I mean nobody has explained to me yet how bitcoin isn't totally dependent on fiat currency for it's value

But...What does that even mean? How is it dependent on fiat currency, or USD as you said, for its value?

Right now, the de facto world reserve currency is the USD. Almost everything is priced in USD. How does f.ex. a gold bar ""depend on USD for its value"" just because it is priced in USD?

Bitcoin is a new asset class, being both a commodity store of value and a currency. It's only natural that its relative worth be measured in USD until its no longer natural to value things in USD.

"Oh sure, on the left side, you have the cash committed to buy, and how much bitcoin that could buy at the spot price in the middle (whatever it last sold for).

So from where the left and right meet, in the valley, the left side is the buyers.  The right hand side is the sellers.

If you see a vertical wall, what that is is a large amount of bitcoin that someone wants to sell at a specific price. The shape of that curve up and away to the right from the mid point represents the accumulated bitcoin in height, and going to the right what price in dollars they'll sell that. Walls there represent ""resistance"" to price rises. If the walls turn the buyers back, buyers start to lose hope of a breakout (and gains), and give up and either drop their buys or become sellers themselves.

The left side represents buyers. The height represents how much bitcoin, total, in USD value is trying to buy. The distance going back to the left is the specific price they want to buy at. Walls there on the buy side represent ""support"". 

But buy and sell walls can flash, come and go, and on some exchanges the buy and sell walls can be invisible :/ (for big buyers or big sellers). So it's more of a fun game. You are watching the surface fight of buyers who ponied up cash and wired it into the exchange (which takes time) and sellers who transferred bitcoin from their wallets to the exchange to sell (which is easy to do in an hour at home 24/7). So the sellers have a slight advantage. This leap to $10k has taken a month to develop. It can take a shit load of time to get an account approved, get in KYC / AML paperwork, and get trading. Selling your bitcoin is so fast, that in my opinion there's always downwards pressure.

Now smarter traders always keep some back in fiat for good buying opportunities, and never sell all their crypto or spend all their dollars.

"Well the wall has to not get eaten through before the bulls run out of steam to buy, then the prices can fall, because there's two kinds of buying - passive, where you have buys set up for people to sell into, like nets for catching bitcoin, or active, where you get filled at market price at the lowest of the sells. Those active bulls are the ones testing the walls. The supporting bulls are there for cheap coins.

So yes, a huge sell wall normally causes bulls to lose steam. But if they see there are no further walls, they could have a breakout.

If the sellers, bears, sell - dump onto the market, they can crash through support walls and cause a break down.";2;0;False;walloon5;dqhkdi0;It's official! 1 Bitcoin = $10,000 USD;7g9cd3;https://v.redd.it/e7io27rdgt001

But what makes Bitcoin an asset in the first place? It all just seems imaginary to me. You can't buy anything with Bitcoin, you can only trade it for real money correct?

So I really don't have any money until I can manage to sell off my bitcoins to some anonymous rich guy online? I can't be crazy for thinking this all just seems made up.

As a currency it does exactly what a lot of people want -- to act as a store of value.  Further, it's practical to use as a medium of exchange.    You can have fiat  cash holdings, which,  has a rate of value deprecation of about 2% annually from the start date of ""saving"" (considered the optimal target amount of loss of stored value annual fro those that issue the the currency).  It's kinda better to go into debt over saving that currency, right? As the actual cost of said debt actually awards you a savings (assuming an annual interest rate owed on that debt amount is either equal, or greater than zero, but, less than actually realized amount of inflation over the set of time it takes you payback that loan).

Now, there exists a competitor that currently awards you saving...  I guess what I'm saying is simply get a credit card with a very high credit limit and as close to zero for the APR that exists....  Seems like an easy method to make quick cash while remaining debt neutral, or, go into debt on the gamble but realize the real gain comes from having the potential to have an asset of value for retirement...

I think Bitcoin has a lot of potential and use. The current prices are what they are imo due to speculative investment, so if the price stagnates I think a crash will follow. (investors will only wait so long).  


> you are also assuming that technology does not improve
 
Not so much. I don't think technology or regulation will be the cause of a crash.  I see a crash as healthy, and a natural consequence of the non-users (speculative investors) cashing out at some point.

That won't be the end of bitcoin, just a healthy price correction as the price settles down to what it will be without so much speculative investment. At some point the price gets so high that people realize they can retire and live very well by cashing out, and supply starts to overwhelm demand.

The other thing is that the mem pool really hasnt grown much in relation to the growth of the price which says to me that most of the increase it due to speculation.

Most people here would say we're not in 2013 anymore to your comment but i agree that bitcoins biggest use cases are not exactly day to day trade. The fact that we've had businesses accept btc before and they pulled the option because of lack of interest suggests that this is only true for day to day.

"Thing is we had stores accept bitcoin before and the interest was low so they pulled the option. They also were mostly immediately liquidating their bitcoin through a third party which put selling pressure on the market because they can't really keep something so volatile because businesses need stability. Japan is a very strange country economically. They have had a deflation issue for close to 3 decades which has crippled a lot of their economy. I imagine people will be happy enough to sell you real estate in a bullish market but in a bearish market no so much and bitcoin can't be a bull market forever because it would cripple investment in every other aspect of the economy because people will likely still hoard bitcoin because it's deflationary. The following if directly from the bitcoin wiki in regards to deflation.

>The key difference is that people don't foresee a fixed cost (unit amount) that they must pay with Bitcoin. If the value of the Bitcoins that they own increases, then any future cost will take a proportionally smaller amount of Bitcoins. There isn't any fixed incentive to holding Bitcoin other than speculation.

"Not over the course of 6 years though, there have been multiple bear and bull markets in that time. It will cycle, always has this run has been going on for like 2 years now but no one knows where on when it will stop or where it will come back to. I got my first BTC at $1.50 and held through about 4-5 bubbles where I would see my net worth go from up a hell of a lot and then down a hell of a lot. And when you go from having over 100K to less than 20K in a bear market that's no fun if you actually need to use the capital, even worse when that market last for about 2 years. I've watched it go from about $2 to $32 and back to about $5. and from about $50 to about $1300 and back to $200.

We'll have to wait and see how this plays out but my gut feeling is if too many more people dive in and over-invest then when the market does start to turn and doesn't recover you'll see massive increases in the mem pool (because scaling simply hasn't kept up with the increase in users, yet at least) where people are trying to cash out and when that happens, and their transactions take an extended period, then a lot of people will end up crying to regulators which could cause a cascading sell off.

"Bitcoin transactions are processed on a distributed network. That means people will need to dedicate computer processing power to actually do the work.

The people who volunteer computer processing power to facilitate this are the miners. The actual processing of these transactions is the act of mining.

Every time a new set of transactions is processed, a small amount of new bitcoin is created and awarded to one of the miners or group of miners working on processing those transactions.

Since there's increasing numbers of bitcoin, users and transactions, it's more and more work to process everything. Which means the workload vs reward is skewing increasingly further towards more work.

In the early days, it was entirely possible to earn quite a bit of bitcoin with your personal computer. Of course at the time bitcoin was almost worthless.

"**Black Wednesday**

Black Wednesday occurred in the United Kingdom on 16 September 1992, when John Major's Conservative government was forced to withdraw the pound sterling from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) after it was unable to keep the pound above its agreed lower limit in the ERM. In 1997, the UK Treasury estimated the cost of Black Wednesday at £3.4 billion. In 2005, documents released under the Freedom of Information Act revealed that the actual cost may have been slightly less, £3.3 billion. Until the United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union in June 2016 it was the most significant event to happen during its time as a member of the European Union and was made even more embarrassing as the United Kingdom was holding the Presidency of the European Communities at the same time.

The trading losses in August and September were estimated at £800 million, but the main loss to taxpayers arose because devaluation could have made them a profit.

"I think we will have to disagree here. You hold the view you should invest in traditional means, I do not. 

Your goal is to somehow spread the idea that this entire venture is silly, an area where you will find no support.

Unfortunately, the way you will take it is that everyone other than you is illogical, and is throwing their money into a pit.

I've had worse investments than bitcoin. I've moved across the world multiple times. I've been in bad breakups. I've spent money to live places where I got zero percent return on my investment and somehow, life has moved on, I live a happy, fulfilling life, and Cryptos are some of my investments.

If bitcoin fell to zero tomorrow, I would shrug my shoulders and move on with my life.

Life is full of risks. If you want to invest in your 6% per year investment fund, go ahead. Like banks, they will always be there, willing to give you the minimum while they take the maximum.

It is the easy way. There is no shame in doing it, technically it makes sound financial sense.

You find it silly. That's fine, my parents find it silly. They do not understand technology, risk, or the environment of the world today. You sound like a similar person, likely an older risk averse person. Its possible you are younger and simply scared. Nothing really wrong with that, you just don't mesh well with people who are willing to get creative.

No one is reading this far down by now but I figured I'd try one more time - other people can invest in different things than you'd enjoy or support, and thats OK. No one wanted computers, or telephones, or a space shuttle, but people created them anyways and pushed innovation forward.

Very few people understand the workings of a stock market, or an online marketplace like amazon, but they still exist and still operate, even though they are not physical things. 

That's just the direction technology is moving. Its fine if you don't understand it or are afraid - a lot of people are risk adverse.

The banks don’t issue refunds, they put an “authorization only” on your card which falls off a few days later. Plus credit card companies protect you more than the businesses (you spending money means they make more money from interchange). If you are ever charged for an item you did not receive you call your credit card company and issue a chargeback. At that point it’s up to the business to show proof and if they don’t you get your money back and they get hit with a chargeback.

Thanks, I'll check that out, but in the meantime I have a more core question. When you say cryptocurrency will replace banks, do you mean banks like the Federal Reserve or banks like Bank of America? Based on my limited understanding of blockchain technology, I can see how its implementation can result in drastic changes of the former, but I can't see the latter ever changing unless we stop using currency altogether. Bitcoin will not replace the need for financing, and as long as there's a need for financing, there will be institutions that pool money from depositors and then loan out a portion of it with interest. Both credit unions and banks do this, and both operate based on the fractional reserve concept. The only difference is credit unions are non-profits, which lets them have different priorities than banks. ;1;1;False;demos11;dqhz2ho;It's official! 1 Bitcoin = $10,000 USD;7g9cd3;https://v.redd.it/e7io27rdgt001

"Actually, it means exactly that. Bitcoin's rising value right now is not tied to increasing *use* of bitcoin as a currency. It's tied to increasing numbers of people and even investment groups buying into the hype hoping to profit from the cycle.

Sooner or later that's going to reach it's apex, when people realise it stops rising, they'll start selling. And the selling will continue until there's a new equilibrium is reached. And that new equilibrium will be based on what people are willing to pay for bitcoin simply for the functionality it provides instead of the hope it'll keep inflating based on media hype.

That stabilized value determined by function will be a mere fraction of the value determined by hype and hot air. It's the very definition of a bubble.

No because this post is recruiting new investors, which is who my original comment was made for. [Invest now and let me know how it goes later] is what I'm requesting, detailed in the previous comments above this. I'm really not trying to be hostile but I've had very close friends and family lose so much money from not knowing what they're doing that that's why I'm warning others. Bitcoin is not for those who don't know what they're doing. People that see this post are going to get excited and go out and try to get some bitcoins and lose a lot of money, and I'm trying to keep them from doing that. And the people that do know what they're doing aren't going to listen to me and they will make money. But even those that know what they're doing lose a lot of money. Look at Trump and how many billions of dollars he lost and yet he obviously knows what he's doing because he made billions back again. But that doesn't change the fact that he still lost billions to begin with. I can't even imagine how many people are losing money by buying into the Bitcoin hysteria. People like my uncle and some friends. These are other people's family losing money too because they buy into the hysteria not knowing what they're doing. If you're one of the ones that do know what you're doing then great, but I want you to invest now like a newbie and let me know the details a year from now after selling.

"When you set up a wallet it will give you a ""seed"" which is just a list of 12 words. It's basically a password that lets you recover your wallet if anything happens to it. So just write down the seed and keep it somewhere safe, away from the wallet. A bank box or at your mom's house or something like that. It's not recommended to save it on your phone or computer because in case that gets hacked they can steal all of your coins. 

I just use a USB stick and make a copy of it - so I don't even have to use the seed if something happens to one of them. Of course I keep the seed just in case. But that's one of the great things about the blockchain - the info is out there and can always be accessed. But the actual coins can't be moved unless you have the wallet and password, or the seed. 

There are fancy wallets like Trezor you can buy which have some other neat security features. But the built in security is already very good - so long as no one gets your wallet + password, or gets your seed. 

You don't want to leave a lot of coins on the exchanges, though, because something could happen to the exchange. Or the exchange could steal them - that's what happened with Mt. Gox, the first big exchange. 

There are also wallets online, like at blockchain.info. More secure than leaving them on an exchange because only you own the seed or private key (a private key is basically the same thing as a seed). Even if the site went down, you could recover the wallet. 

It's all a bit daunting at first, but once you learn a few of the basics it gets really easy. Just do a little research before trying things. You can set up a wallet with no risk - it is empty until you send some coins to it. And you can send one cent worth of bitcoin to it to test it.

"Bitcoin is different in this regard. Unlike with penny stocks or stocks the coin is bound to pure computation power as such you cannot give out just another penny stock paper if you feel like it.

Also cashing out is not as easy as you think it is. If a lot of people try cashing out the network will become slower as in almost coming to a halt since all transactions are executed by the miners and they don't have endless computation powers. Meaning they prefer those that pay higher fees until it gets to the point of them being ridiculous high and slow as well. Given that there are often limits in place of how much you can cash out per day/week/month will only make matters worse. 

As such an headless mass panic will often be grind to an halt before it even begins. If it comes to exiting the crypto-market as a whole that is.

2018 things will change a lot which will make it hardly predicitable. Speakingly futures for BTC (supposed to launch this december) and technology advancements regarding Off-Chain transactions for example the Lightning Network that takes Miners out of the equation when it comes to swap coins with the same cryptographically base like Bitcoin, LTC, VTC, GRC with minimal fees and way faster transactions.

"I know about Venezuela and agree that bitcoin has many benefits but it's nowhere near ready to be adopted by the whole world. It's simply not feasible to scale a blockchain to accommodate everyone yet and the majority of other coins are utter pump and dump crap, at the moment the network throughput is 7tx/sec and coinbase alone is adding 100,000 users daily. The fee's are denominated in BTC and I've seen insane fee's during spam periods to get a tx on a block and this isn't an easily solved problem, the higher the BTC price goes the less likely your average person(or people from countries that actually need it) are going to be able to use it. The tech simply isn't ready (and I've been in bitcoin since 2011 precisely because of my lack of trust in big banks and spent years learning all the different aspects).

I've had a lot of people recently get in touch who want to buy bitcoin (that I have literally been shouting at people to buy since it was $1.50 literally every time it cycles through a period of growth and bottoms out I tell people and they are were never interested), not because they see it as useful but because they see it as an investment.  Coworkers and family members that got bored of me talking about it are asking about it now they see it on the news hitting ATH after ATH they are interested, that's pure speculation. This is very reminiscent of 2013 but on a much larger scale which IMO will attract a lot of unwanted attention.

You should know the issues with a deflationary currency(I believe it's a good store of value) causing hoarding and a lack of investment and economic depressions so the dream of hyperbitcoinization really is far fetched IMO and noone has been able to tell me how a deflationary currency is going to work in practice. Bitcoin will eternally be in a bubble it always goes through the periods of growth but the market sentiment is incredibly fragile. The smallest bit of news and the market sentiment changes very quickly. 

I will not be surprised if it goes up 10x-100x from here but I think we'll be seeing suicide hotlines posted on this sub once again before long because too many people have literally no idea what they are getting themselves into (and I'm fairly certain it's not your average person market buying 2000 BTC at $8800 on GDAX or chewing at 100 BTC walls at ATHs) and have way over invested considering it's still a pretty young experiment. The growth will eventually slow, returns dwindle and the bears will appear and fear will take over. You don't have to look any further than this sub to see that so many people are obsessed with gains(in fiat) rather than the technology.

"**Tulip mania**

Tulip mania, tulipmania, or tulipomania (Dutch names include: tulpenmanie, tulpomanie, tulpenwoede, tulpengekte and bollengekte) was a period in the Dutch Golden Age during which contract prices for some bulbs of the recently introduced and fashionable tulip reached extraordinarily high levels and then dramatically collapsed in February 1637. It is generally considered the first recorded speculative bubble (or economic bubble); although some researchers have noted that the Kipper- und Wipperzeit (literally Tipper and See-saw) episode in 1619–1622, a Europe-wide chain of debasement of the metal content of coins to fund warfare, featured mania-like similarities to a bubble. In many ways, the tulip mania was more of a hitherto unknown socio-economic phenomenon than a significant economic crisis (or financial crisis).

"**Belgium**

Belgium ( ( listen)), officially the Kingdom of Belgium, is a sovereign state in Western Europe bordered by France, the Netherlands, Germany, Luxembourg, and the North Sea. It is a small, densely populated country which covers an area of 30,528 square kilometres (11,787 sq mi) and has a population of about 11 million people. Straddling the cultural boundary between Germanic and Latin Europe, Belgium is home to two main linguistic groups: the Dutch-speaking, mostly Flemish community, which constitutes about 59 percent of the population, and the French-speaking, mostly Walloon population, which comprises about 40 percent of all Belgians. Additionally, there is a small ~1 percent group of German speakers who live in the East Cantons.

"This might sound like a stupid comment (and maybe it is), but this will actually be an issue when it comes to pricing, which has a huge affect on real-world transactions. People need to really understand just how much money they are actually spending on something, which can be difficult because of the volatility of Bitcoin right now. 

The nearest parallel I can think of is when the UK moved to decimal currency back in the 70s, or maybe the intro of the Euro. 

Made up numbers because example: If I'm buying a can of Coke for a buck, that's, what, 100,000 satoshi? But next week a buck might be 50,000 satoshi, or 300,000. Does the store need to change all it's signage to keep up? Did the Coke go up or down in price? This kind of stuff is pretty confusing for the average person, so Bitcoin remains slightly limited for the moment. I think this will change as time goes on, but right now, it means a lot of the interest is in investment, not in actually using, which is a worry.

>Speculators will drop it as soon as they think it's a good idea

This is true of a stock for example, because you can't buy food with stocks. It is not necessarily true with bitcoin. Speculators can hold onto it forever and still be speculators. This is because they can buy something with the currency and their speculation is based on the worth of that currency increasing relative to the price of goods.

>So a drop will most likely be huge.

This sounds like wishful thinking on the part of late investors. The price has been rising and dropping, but the trend is always rising. We have already hit many milestones that should have seen these speculators drop everything. I am sure many did, but many more are waiting. If a 5x increase in price didn't cause this massive end of world drop, what will exactly?

You see, by the time bitcoin hits its peak, the people who held on will have no incentive to drop at all. They will have bitcoins, and those bitcoins will be ubiquitous because that is only way bitcoin would have hit its peak. This means bitcoin will be an established currency by this time and the game is over.

When do you expect all the speculators to drop? Try to answer that question. You will find that many people can keep small amounts of bitcoin in terms of what they think is small, and they will hold onto them, and hold onto them, because there will need to be a 100x price rise for them to really care. So they will all be holding, but then hey, bitcoin will be everywhere and useful.

Ultimately what gets bitcoin beyond all of this speculation and to success is its merit. It appears to be a much better form of currency then existing forms of currency.";2;0;False;1892749124124;dqhvpnq;It's official! 1 Bitcoin = $10,000 USD;7g9cd3;https://v.redd.it/e7io27rdgt001

"What is it that you people don't understand about the fact that, this speculative behavior is not only inevitable and unavoidable...but actually serves a purpose?

There is no other way for price discovery of a market-based proto-money to occur; there is no other way to distribute the token and overcome the coordination problems inherent in trying to get people to hold and use a money, which is not yet money until a lot of people hold and use it.

The speculation *has* to happen this way; its not a function of bitcoin's protocol or of the immaturity of bitcoin users. The developers didn't just forget to program stability in, you know? Its a function of economics.

The value of money is in its utility as a medium of *indirect exchange*...in other words, the value is in having a share of a vast network of trading partners. Money doesn't need to be edible or useful in industry or good for making fire...it just needs to be a token held by a lot of people, and be scarce, fungible, homogenous, verifiable, transportable, and durable; then it naturally becomes a valuable network good; a medium of indirect exchange, store of value, and unit of account.

The volatility is slowly-but-surely decreasing as the market cap and liquidity and range of uses increase.  It will continue to do this in an ugly, non-linear fashion, where bubbles and busts continue, as they have been, to be the number one force which broadens the user-base. 

While you all have just come in to this phenomenon in the last few months, and you come to impart your cynical wisdom to us *hapless* bitcoiners who just don't understand that this is all going to come crashing down...the rest of us have been here, buying and holding through 4 or 5 or 6 such cycles, exactly as is happening now (only this one is less volatile in terms of percentages than previous ones)...and we gleefully await picking up more cheap coins again, when this next correction comes.

You will not hear of us again for several years...all the while, smugly assuming you were right, and [bitcoin has died](https://99bitcoins.com/obituary-stats/). Then, out of the blue, bitcoin will be resurging to prices an order of magnitude higher than now.

"Personally, I think BTC has no choice to but to go up for a while. I'm still not touching it because that's a very low-confidence assessment...

But BTC is 3/4 through its maximum capacity. A Satoshi is still only worth 1/100 of a penny. Market cap and trading volume are high. It is a really good place to hold buckets of money in a national currency-agnostic way.

It created a new market people didn't think was needed because the USD already exists, but it turns out crypto is fulfilling a lot of peoples' needs and desires.

That being said, crypto itself has a weird function. Lots and lots of electricity being burned by miners. Transaction fees are already high: https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/5qnw5h/when_will_we_reach_the_21_millions_bitcoin_cap/

I think once BTC crosses the 1 Satoshi >= $0.01 threshold, you lose utility. This is BOUND to happen since supply is controlled, unless the spec is changed... but who controls that vote? Miners and investment firms already have a lot on the line. BTC can be forked, but I think money will ultimately control the spec.

"It's far more rational to expect bitcoin to plummet downwards once the largest speculators decide it's time to sell than to expect this trend to keep going.

Bitcoin isn't going up in value because it's proving it's used. It's going up because greedy people see profit in a high risk, high reward gambit. It blew past 10k because people are literally speculating on bitcoin hoping to get a good return percentage.

Sooner or later it's going to peak, the speculators are going to decide the risk is starting to outweigh the potential profit gain and sell. Bitcoin drops all the way back down to its actual value derived from utility. And that's a fraction of its current worth.

This place is full of self deluding hodlers and new paradigm cultists. It's good for a laugh but it's sad to see people running their finances on irrational fantasies they don't understand themselves.

You're really underestimating the value of the technology and you don't recognize the disruptive potential it has. Let's say a software company creates an application, they control it and can decide who access it and who doesn't, their revenue comes feom granting clients access to its application and they can do that because they own it. The good part of owning the application is that they control it but this has a downside, since the company controls it they can't assure beyond all doubt that the application won't be modified or changed in some way, so the clients need to trust the company. What blockchain allows us to do is to create decentralised applications(dApps) which allows us to take the trusting part out of the equation, the users know without doubt that the rules of the game can't be changed. But this has a downside, you can only assure you can't modify it if you renounce control over it, and that's what happens when you upload a dApp to a blockchain you lose all control over it, even the control to decide who has and hasn't access to it. That's where cryptocurrencies become relevant, the way we have found to give the content creators an economic incentive to create these applications and give them up to the network is by creating a cryptocurrency embedded in its code that solves who has access to it and who doesn't.;-1;1;False;Enchilada_McMustang;dqhrh1a;It's official! 1 Bitcoin = $10,000 USD;7g9cd3;https://v.redd.it/e7io27rdgt001

The problem is a deflation currency doesn't work because it contracts an economy because it makes sense to hoard it not invest it. Bitcoin is a store of value not a currency. The block reward wont even stop until 2140. We had a load of stores accept BTC before(even airlines) and they pulled the option because no one wanted to spend it.;5;1;False;-mjneat;dqhxdyw;It's official! 1 Bitcoin = $10,000 USD;7g9cd3;https://v.redd.it/e7io27rdgt001
"That's only because USD or whatever you're comparing it to is more commonly traded. If bitcoin became the staple and USD was a minority of transactions, you'd have a reversal. USD would fluctuate greatly based on what people were willing to pay at the moment.

With that being said, I think bitcoin fucked up in two ways - by limiting the supply and with the progression of halving the reward. The halving should stop at some point - i.e., when you get to the 64th halving, it should stay at that level, because we will always have an increasing population which means we will always have increasing demand. People will always make mistakes and lose coins. If the value never becomes slightly deflationary, people will always hesitate to spend it.

Also, I think the supply (halving) should have taken into account the rate of adoption. Naturally you're going to have exponential adoption at some point in it's lifecycle. There should be exponential supply to keep the value stable, otherwise you're just generating bubbles.

"This is likely going to be an unpopular view in this sub (I came from r/all) but I don't think most of bitcoins price rise is at all related to it's utility, it's almost entirely speculation. 

The reason why I say that is:

1.) Bitcoin is not unique or even particularly good at what it does. There are hundreds of other coins that literally do exactly the same thing and in many cases better than bitcoin. There's absolutely no scarcity for the service it provides.


2.) As you pointed out, use wise, it's not particularly friendly to the average person. Nobody wants to use bitcoin for convenience. Its best real use cases are mostly black/grey market.";5;1;False;disquiet;dqi47m2;It's official! 1 Bitcoin = $10,000 USD;7g9cd3;https://v.redd.it/e7io27rdgt001

>The key difference is that people don't foresee a fixed cost (unit amount) that they must pay with Bitcoin.

That's not necessarily true though(at least in regard to inflation and deflation), look at Japan over the last 30 years. They have had economic difficulties for years because deflation and lack of spending. I agree that bail outs and too big to fail are a problem but it seems that the inflation argument is more to do with the lack of rising wages than inflation or deflation, which is a different beast all together. The consensus is about 2% inflation is optimal to maintain investment and enough spending in the economy.;4;0;False;-mjneat;dqi9euj;It's official! 1 Bitcoin = $10,000 USD;7g9cd3;https://v.redd.it/e7io27rdgt001
Thats the deflationary spiral though. Thats actually a bad thing(if everyones on board) because it discourages investment and spending causing an econemy to slow and go into depressions. Look at japan since the early 90s their economy has suffered a hell of a lot exactly for that reason. Its why deflation is actually a bad thing for a currencies. If no one is buying then there are no jobs and things dont get done. If investment doesnt happen then infrastructure doesnt get improved. Theres no(or much less) incentive to invest if its that much harder to get your initial investment back. Inflation encourages investment (not that i agree with a lot of monetary policies).

""Q. What do you primarily use bitcoins for? Do you still control millions of dollars worth?

A. Bitcoin as a currency is meant to be spent. Those 10,000 BTC made it back into the economy fairly quickly, around the time they were worth some $400. A ~10x ROI from simply trading in a different currency is quite good, even if that factor could have been higher had I held on to said currency longer. Naturally there will always be people hoarding coins, trying to get rich, and quite a few people did get quite rich, but they wouldn't have got that way without economic growth allowing it. To that extent my bitcoin holdings do usually measure in hundreds or thousands of USD, simply because I use them much as I would a checking account, to conduct business both online and offline when I have the opportunity. Notably the ""humble bundles"" and the attached store accepting bitcoins significantly bolstered my video game library.""

In bitcoin, you can think of people looking at future returns on bitcoin, compared to their current position in assets and then making a choice:

""Do I want less risk, more certain returns on this future value, by getting some value out now?"" 

OR

""Do I have plenty of assets (or am I a desperate degenerate gambler) and I would like to build on my certain asset base (or deep hole) and increase my risk, but on the higher possible payout in the future?""

Everyone's doing this, with stocks, real estate, all kinds of things, and cryptos are just a new way to do it.

"> It has always recovered.
  
The past can be a poor predictor of the future, if you look at a tiny segment. If every business/currency etc that dropped in value inevitably recovered that value, you'd be onto something.  
  
Learn from history. [Tulip bulbs.] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulip_mania)    
edit: seems the thing is exaggerated, there are other examples e.g. a lot of businesses had share prices rise and then crash.
  
~~They had a value as tulip bulbs that would produce beautiful tulips, but their value was far less than the speculation driven price. The thing that has in common with Bitcoin is the speculative bubble. The vast majority of people didn't want tulips for their beauty, but for the money they'd get. After the speculators withdrew, the value plummeted down to its 'sane' value. You know, the price you'd pay for a tulip bulb because you want to grow some tulips in your garden.~~  
         
Bitcoin hasn't -really- dropped yet. Once it loses all value as a speculative investment, you will see just how valued it is as a very niche & cumbersome currency (relative to the ease of use for credit/debit cards online).

"Unfortunately, we don't know that. ""Room to grow"" isn't based on any measurable reality.

Bitcoin is growing because there are huge amounts of money being injected on the speculation that it will continue to grow, with no backing or regulation. The moment large investors, including foreign manipulators, calculate that they can withdraw to maximize their initial investment based on slowing growth, they will. That will trigger a cascade as others try to get out because, more so than other bubbles, this only exists because they're in it. As soon as those large players bail, this falls just as quickly as it grows.

For long-term investment or stable currency options, you don't want skyrocketing; stable, understood growth is key. This volatility can go both ways.

"Man, it feels like yesterday Bitcoin was at $9,000, but that was actually [two days ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7fkqh5/its_over_9000/).

The price of bitcoin is rising at 5% *per day*! That means that one of the following scenarios will likely happen

1. The 5% a day trend continues, and Bitcoin will hit $20,000 USD in the next two weeks 
2. The price increases speed up, to the moon! 
3. The trend flatlines, and Bitcoin stops rising. Speculators pull out, stop-losses get hit, and the price begins to fall. 
4. As above, but the prices falls really fast and it's a crash.

I have no idea what the relative probabilities of these four options are (well, I have *some* idea, but I'm not an expert), but I caution everyone buying bitcoin to make sure you have stop-losses set so that you'll sell automatically if the price falls to a certain point, instead of waking up one day and missing the chance to get out with most of your money intact.

Can someone please help me get my bitcoins out of bitcoin core. I had such a small amount left when a bitcoin was only worth 200$ that I just left it there. Now when I go to load up bitcoin core it takes literally days to load the blockchain meaning I cant access my wallet.

"Can someone help me understand something about Bitcoin. Say that it does eventually stabilise and people are comfortable to use Bitcoin for purchases. Doesn’t the long decimal place nature of it mean it will be hard to ‘sense’ the value of something, the way you automatically can with dollar-unit currency?

What I mean is, right now, you kind of know that a pizza is worth about 5 or 10 bucks, a nice car worth $30K or whatever. But, with Bitcoin, won’t you always have to convert the price into something you can more easily intuit? 

Example: Pizza A is BTC.00091, and pizza B is .00182. Pizza B is twice as much as A, but you (well, I at least) would have to calculate every single transaction and, if not convert back to dollars to compare, then at least find some rough comparison calc that I am unlikely to be able to do in my brain, on the spot.

"Too bad you'll never get that $10,000 because you'll never be able to sell the bitcoins you mine for $10,000. Making money off Bitcoin is worse than all of the ""get rich quick"" scams that have swept through the country over the past few decades. Just like all the other get rich quick scams, the rich get richer and the people that fall for it get duped out of their money. In this case the rich want us to invest money into buying Bitcoin mining hardware and think we can mine a bunch of virtual money that we can materialize, which in actuality will never materialize. Don't believe it until your friend or neighbor shows you their checking account quadrupling every week. 

Edit: I'm getting a strong feeling this post is filled with investors trying to make a few bucks off others, and potentially people who have bought into Bitcoin and are now stuck with an investment they are having trouble cashing in on. The best way for anyone to make money back on the market is to get a bunch of unsuspecting optimistic folk to purchase other people's failed investment. If you're new to reading about Bitcoin take my advice and heavily research it before investing. Research the cons of Bitcoin and make an educated decision before throwing your money at it. Don't let downvotes convince you of anything; Bitcoin is a get rich quick hysteria that the world's most prominent investors have spoken about for a long time. I'm trying to save some of you from throwing your money away because not everyone is going to make money. Just like any get rich quick scheme, some people make it while a lot of people don't. You never know if the people replying to you online are scam artists or normal investors telling the truth about a good investment. All these people replying to me sound like investors in Bitcoin, so don't learn from them because Bitcoin investors are biased. They will defend their investment. Learn about Bitcoin from people that aren't invested in it because they have nothing to lose and with no commitment to an investment they are an unbiased source. Be careful who you learn from.

"Bitcoins are a pyramid scheme requiring the cooperation of tons of people to overvalue something that is completely worthless.  They have scammed everyone involved, including governments that *have actual laws in place prohibiting alternative currencies, like the United States*, to go along with this scam.

They are worth exactly $0, and their use creates an artificial monetary exchange outside of the standard channels of currency, which can create black markets and other shady exchanges of high value goods.  Bitcoin is an illegal scam done by a huge group of scam artists that make their fake, illegal pseudo-currency only worth what they think it's worth.  At least actual currencies have the backing of national and world banks with some sort of force of value and legitimacy behind it.

I have pushed for the criminalization of bitcoin since its inception, only to have my logical, common sense pleas fall on deaf ears because of greed and the delusion of people to join in on a pyramid scheme.  This is not a ""boo hoo, I didn't get in on the ground floor so I'm salty"" rant, since I had ample opportunities to do just that, and did not because I knew right from wrong.

I would’ve grabbed a couple and I would be sitting in a nice apartment with a blonde bimbo blowing my junk. ;1;1;False;Justlurkin6921;dqi52sd;It's official! 1 Bitcoin = $10,000 USD;7g9cd3;https://v.redd.it/e7io27rdgt001

So when bitcoin was $20/coin a few years (months?) ago and if I would have bought 2 coins, I’d be able to collect $20K right now? When you sell your coins does it go to your debit card? Is it taxed? Do you get a check? Very confused on how you get your payout. ;1;3;False;football2106;dqi9e61;It's official! 1 Bitcoin = $10,000 USD;7g9cd3;https://v.redd.it/e7io27rdgt001

"If you are new to Bitcoin, remember that:

1) You didn't miss the boat. Bitcoin is still in its early phases and it hasn't yet even come close to reaching mass adoption or institutional investment.

2) Bitcoin is highly divisible. The price is never ""too high"" to invest your first $50 into it - a 200% increase is still 200%, no matter how much of a Bitcoin you've bought, and it is predicted to keep going.

3) The best time to invest in Bitcoin was 7 years ago. The second best time is NOW.

There were people kicking themselves at $1000 that they missed the boat. These same people will be kicking themselves at $100,000.

edit: To all the people DMing me and what not to learn about Bitcoin, I appreciate it but I don't have time to respond to everyone! 

The easiest way for you to get some bitcoin for yourself is simply to download the app 'Coinbase' and you literally just buy as much as you want on your debit card. That's not the ideal way to purchase bitcoin, all you really need to do is read this website. 

https://howtobuybitcoin.io/

If you want to know the tech behind it, that'll take more reading and it'll never really make complete sense to you lol.

edit 2: https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6a04mc/why_have_i_been_trading_on_coinbase_vs_gdax/

edit 3: 

Let's say you wanted to buy and store a bitcoin - before I go on, it's important to stress **YOU CAN BUY FRACTIONS OF A BITCOIN**, it doesn't have to be a full 10k to start - your first step would be to setup a wallet. Search this subreddit to read their recommendations, there's even a [link](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Storing_bitcoins) on the sidebar for it. I personally use Electrum. If you google it, you'll probably be able to set it up pretty easily. From there, you'll have a bitcoin adress. It'll look something like this: 

1BAmLFekj8P6cM7nyYkb4sqFqsTdKo2Wk1 (one of mine)

With that adress, if you purchase any amount of BTC on a site like Coinbase(see above and use GDAX) you can then send your BTC to the adress that you'll see in your wallet to keep it safe.

>>* Never try to time the market. [Dollar cost average](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dollarcostaveraging.asp) by buying what you can afford to lose every week.
 
>>* Once Bitcoin in wallet--->[HODL!](https://i.redd.it/fvh3ibzxz8kz.jpg) (never [panic-sell](https://youtu.be/g1HzU_gHSDI?t=181)), if the price goes down, buy the dips.
 
>>* [Never (NSFW-'naked short' gets stripped by the bull market)](https://imgur.com/4Yip2iF), ever, [short Bitcoin](https://imgur.com/j7MZuMZ).

>> It is always a good time to buy Bitcoin if you are [hodling long term](https://i.redd.it/pc1exi5dd0ez.jpg) and not just for [day trading](https://i.redd.it/vis4nvsd3flz.jpg), so this is a great [strategy](https://imgur.com/PJDf2tp). Remember that Bitcoin has practically been up most of the time,  [and the road to the moon is paved with minor corrections](https://i.redd.it/kfgi0cdkt36z.png) (Bitcoin is never really  ""down"" when you zoom-out). 

 > > Everybody parroting: ""[The bitcoin bubble is about to pop](https://i.redd.it/ooxw816ai6yz.jpg)"" since 2009, don't know that bitcoin is a decentralized system with mathematically fixed, deflationary and limited supply currency and its growth is [exponential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_growth), not linear.

We roll like Moses, claimin’ our promised land
And? If we win our independence?
Is that a guarantee of freedom for our descendants?
Or will the blood we shed begin an endless
Cycle of vengeance and death with no defendants?
I know the action in the street is excitin’
But Jesus, between all the bleedin’ ‘n fightin’

We need to handle our financial situation
Are we a nation of states? What’s the state of our nation?

Smashin’ every expectation
Every action’s an act of creation!

For the first time, I’m thinkin’ past tomorrow

"See... I’ve started to flip in the opposite direction now and become concerned about the price rise

Now don’t get me wrong, I’m a massive fan of BTC and it’s capabilities in the long term so still invested obviously  

But recently there’s been a few things that have raised my suspicions... 

- colleagues and others buying in without having a clue what it is but simply because they’ve seen the news that it’s increasing. Supply and demand is artificially inflating the price of a piece of tech that just isn’t read for mainstream adoption... or worth 10k right now imo 

- the whole BitcoinCash political bullshit atm. Realistically, the “owners” of Cash are also heavily invested in BTC (likely still continually buying) and could easily rip their cash out causing huge panic and a price crash - which would also give a poor reflection of the BTC brand 

- rumours flying round the last few weeks that it was Cash owners spamming the network with transactions that led to the 100k mem pool build up also plays into potential attacks on the network - unlikely to be their only play 

I don’t know if it’ll happen anytime soon but the bubble it’s recently got into is gonna pop at some point 😕

Side note to any new crypto enthusiasts: investment is only meaningful on a percentage level.  ETH and LTC are both surging at higher percentages than btc.    If the high barrier of entry to btc is intimidating, look into others and how they’re different.  There are hundreds.

Bitcoin is divisible up to 8 decimal places.  In common parlance, we call this unit the ""satoshi"".

> so even if it someday replaces paper money we will still be in the same situation and bits will be trapped in a ""trickle down"" system

If I have 1 US dollar right now on the other hand, whatever fraction of the economy it is, it will be a smaller fraction tomorrow as the federal reserve keeps on creating more.

Supply and demand. There is a finite amount of supply and as the demand increase so does the value. The good thing is that your supply purchasing power increases. So while you may only have one bitcoin, that can buy you more the further it goes up. For it to jump so rapidly, some major players must have entered the market. Theoretically it should just keep going up because its still becoming mainstream and people who werent in before are getting in now. What would drive it down would be for major players to sell off, but i would think anyone thats in it at the moment is probably in for the long ride.

">gaining legitimacy as a currency

It isn't though. This community used to have the goal of increasing adaptation and acceptance to mainstream vendors. It hasn't happened, if anything, people are even more skeptical.

The value isn't going up because more people are accepting it as currency. It is going up because the entire community is working together to drive it up with promises of infinite exponential growth. Read the comments.

It is a pretty bad sign when a crypto community is no longer pushing and promoting mainstream acceptance as a currency, and instead treating it like a get rich quick scheme.";102;3;False;SlinkyBlue;dqhkqf8;It's official! 1 Bitcoin = $10,000 USD;7g9cd3;https://v.redd.it/e7io27rdgt001

No. The thing with bitcoin is that you can buy any amount of it. You don’t have to buy a whole bitcoin. You can buy 10 bucks worth of it if you want, or 10,000$ of it if you want. The people who are rich are those who invested a lot of money into it when it was cheap (or even a year ago, it was around 800 dollars) and watched it grow to 10K. So if you bought 10 whole bitcoins at 750$ or whatever it was at the beginning of the year, you’d now have 100,000 dollars if you held onto it the whole time. ;3;0;False;ErikTheDon;dqhnrh6;It's official! 1 Bitcoin = $10,000 USD;7g9cd3;https://v.redd.it/e7io27rdgt001

"> Doesn't such a story make it less likely that people will ever use bitcoin to pay for things if future value keeps increasing?

Not really, zoom out to the big picture. 

If bitcoin is easier to use on the Internet than dollars ...

(because you can cross banking borders and cut out the middlemen)

And is technically a better money than dollars 

(irreversible nearly instant settlement - much like a wire transfer but faster - and more certain slow growth on issuance - and if you really want it so bad, you can mine it)

Then if you spend bitcoin, without rebuying, you are selling your bitcoin.

If you spend bitcoin, and refill from your dollars, you have indirectly spent using dollars.

What you can expect, by a slight variation on Gresham's Law  - bad money drives out good - is that yes, people will keep the value in bitcoin, and spend (get rid of) trash money (dollars) and keep bitcoin as hard as they can.

No. There is always an opportunity cost of capital. On that same day there were numerous individuals who also purchased a pizza using US dollars. That money could've been used in exchange for Bitcoin. All throughout Bitcoin's history any time you made a purchase with US Dollars, it could have been going towards Bitcoin. There was an opportunity cost with each decision you made. Does that stop you from acquiring the things that you want? It might actually, but it will really get you to question the general tradeoffs of what is in your present valued interest. Throughout most of history we have had floating interest rates that allowed us to determine the opportunity cost of our money. This is why market pricing is so important. It sends us signals of how capital should be allocated. Growing up my parents could put money in a saving account and actually get a yield and return on their money. Now the young generation are essentially losing purchasing power any time they put it in a savings account. Governments and central banks around the world have destroyed their money system by keeping interest rates at essentially zero to where individuals have little opportunity for actual yield. Bitcoin is changing the system by getting people to really think in terms of opportunity cost again. There is a real tradeoff between savings and consumption. In time as liquidity in the system arises and usage grows, we will see a pricing system in Bitcoin where a market interest rate is determined. This will allow individuals to more freely determine how they should effectively allocate their capital and come to a better conclusion as to how they should use their money: on savings, or on consumption. We are liberating money and in return, liberating the individual. ;2;0;False;purduered;dqhs715;It's official! 1 Bitcoin = $10,000 USD;7g9cd3;https://v.redd.it/e7io27rdgt001
A predictable and constant deflation is not a disincentive to spend once more people are in (the market cap is still less than 0.1% of the economy, so price swings are high).  According to Austrian school economics, the opposite of central banking economics, a predictable rate of deflation (roughly on par with birthrate and liquidity) is conducive to sustainable and prosperous markets.  I mean think about it, is it better to have numbers on a screen or things and services.  The more the price rises the more incentive you have to buy things.;2;0;False;psycholioben;dqhs0ev;It's official! 1 Bitcoin = $10,000 USD;7g9cd3;https://v.redd.it/e7io27rdgt001

"Bitcoin is a currency, as people trust it more, they are willing to a) transact with it more b) hold it for longer periods, c) hold it in larger quantities.  
   
Much of the value of the American dollar comes from the fact that people trust it's issuer. Much of it is held oversears by people that use American coinage as a trusted store of value. All governments print money and ""devalue"" their currencies, but some do it more responsibly than others. Individuals use the currency of the least risk.  

Bitcoin is special in that it's issuance can not be controlled by any individual - nor influenced by any government. It is the most trustworthy currency - in fact trustless. At first everyone is skeptical of this, but we are now 9 years into the life of bitcoin and people now understanding its safety and it's awesomeness.  
Hyperinflation occurs when faith is lost in a currency. We are observing Hyperdeflation where trust rapidly accrues in a currency.

"I'll answer your questions. 

No single entity is setting Bitcoin's price, it is decided by the market. When you say no one is going to buy a Bitcoin for $10k, that is demonstrably and probably false. The fact that people are buying 1 Bitcoin for 10k on the open market is the reason the price hit 10k.

When you say, ""there's not a single time where it would be better to have 1 Bitcoin over,$10,000 actual dollars"", that is provably and demonstrably false. For one, the price of Bitcoin is now pushing 11k, so there's that. If I asked you, would you rather have $10k cash, or another highly liquid asset worth some multiple of 10k, which would you pick?

Look at the handful of failing economies around the world. In Venezuela they are experiencing so much inflation, their paycheck might have 20% less buying power on Tuesday than it did on Monday. People are storing their wealth in Bitcoin to insulate it from bad monetary policy, and because Bitcoin isn't correlated to the stock market, and gives them more portfolio diversification. 
It's also important to realize, I'm not saying people should have 100% crypto and that it should completely replace all forms of money. Just that a small holding of Bitcoin as part of a larger diversified portfolio including stocks, bonds, real estate, etc, is more diversified than it otherwise would be. This alone justifies a value much higher than it currently sits at, given the relatively small supply of Bitcoin and the enormous growing demand.";6;1;False;bitcoin_explained;dqi4mjk;It's official! 1 Bitcoin = $10,000 USD;7g9cd3;https://v.redd.it/e7io27rdgt001

"Doesn't matter if you do or don't right now bad money (cash) is driving out good (bitcoin). Meaning, ultimately people are spending cash (even if they use bitcoin).

Because holding bitcoin which is appreciating makes more sense. It has to be this way for a while.

If you spend bitcoin and don't rebuy, you are spending your bitcoin.

If you spend bitcoin and rebuy, you are actually just spending cash.

Whether your rebuy bitcoin or not, all you are doing is subtly adjusting your ratios of cash to bitcoin. (Some people are not into bitcoin and are all cash, that's fine).

Bitcoin is an incredible way to store value, strictly logistically speaking. You can store an enormous amount of value in a negligible amount of space, hide it incredible easily, transport it globally with ease without even needing to carry it with you. Send it to anyone in any fraction of value--although currently limited to 8 decimal places it is theoretically infinitely divisible with a software update.

"Bitcoin is magic internet money. It’s the first cryptocurrency. Satoshi Nakamoto (who remains anonymous) invented it in 2009. It’s open source and peer to peer. There is no CEO, President, or main office. There aren’t huge servers storing users account information. To me, it has real value because it is scarce, it can be transferred quickly worldwide, it is divisible (you can send/receive/buy /sell fractions of a bitcoin) and it can be used to pay for goods and services. Adoption is increasing and some places that accept bitcoin include Overstock.com. Steam, and you can save money on Amazon buying using bitcoin and the purse.io wallet.

Fake coins are not possible. The network that verifies transactions would reject counterfeits. Bitcoins are “mined” by people with specialized  and expensive computer hardware. The rewards for mining get cut in half every 4 years until eventually 21 million bitcoins will exist. There cant ever  be more than that. So no, nobody can give anyone including themselves unlimited amounts.

When you buy bitcoin, YOU get the money. You don’t trust a 3rd party, if that’s what you want to do. You can be your own bank, if you choose to. With a more secure than average wallet, no1 can stop you from accessing your funds. Bitcoins are stored in digital wallets. Some are more secure than others. Wallets generally go from hot storage (like money in your pocket) to cold storage (like in a vault). 

Wallet providers that handle security for you are examples of 3rd parties in control of your bitcoin who grant you access to it. They could freeze your account for some reason and a host of reasons why not to trust your funds on exchanges long term. Coinbase.com is the most popular way to buy bitcoin. They make it really easy. They handle security for you though. Which is good because it’s easy to get started but I wouldn’t trust them or any exchange with my savings. If they got hacked, I doubt you would see a refund overnight or soon. It’s all relative, but I do not keep more than $100 on Coinbase or any exchange. I ignore Coinbase’s vault features, which still do not put you completely in control.

It’s best to move practically all or all of your bitcoin to one or two of the wallets recommended on the official website once you acquire some from an exchange like Coinbase: [https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet).

Basically.  That's why $10k was so hard to crack yesterday.  Lots of people had that set as their target to sell. Now today, more people took some profits, the price dips and some people make the mistake of panicking and selling off too so it dips more.  I'm sure you'll see posts from people in a couple of days regretting that they had to buy back in higher because they panic sold.  ;53;3;False;JG758;dqixt51;BTC dropping due to lack of quality 11k memes.

Upward price movement is a combination of new money flowing in and people trading on margin  (Borrowing BTC to buy more, no new money entering the ecosystem with this method.)  Then at a certain point, the new money slows down, people margin trading react by also stopping.  Now that everyone realizes the price is stagnating, they begin to take profits.  People margin trading see the price dropping and they begin to short bitcoin, causing the price to further drop.  The market will fluctuate in between support levels (how low it will go) and resistance levels (how high it can go before peaking.)  Successful traders predict these ranges and try buying and selling in between them.;3;0;False;redditM_rk;dqj2f8l;BTC dropping due to lack of quality 11k memes.

Yes, I love Ethereum, Monero and for sentimental reasons Litecoin as well. I will probably convert the free Bitcoin Gold I received into Ethereum, but I'm very happy with bitcoin and never regretted my choice of sticking with it exclusively.

"This dip was predictable. It hovers at 9.8k for days with resistence and as soon as it crosses the 10k line it goes mental to 11k due to the mass fear of missing out by the weak hands. Then it continues to rise a bit before dipping back down to around 10.5k where it should be once people come to their senses.

I made quite a nice little bit of pocket change from this.

All you had to do was view a few exchanges to see a HUGE shear rise in buy orders at exactly 10k... was predictable.

Many other cryptocurrencies aren't equipped for that and they can't rely on nearly as much computational power. If other cryptocurrencies become highly successful (Ethereum already is to an extant), I believe that they'll simply coexist with bitcoin which will remain the gold standard of cryptocurrencies.

It's true that it's very scary how so many people don't know what they're doing and are just in because of the hype that happened in 2017. A couple of days ago, I replied to someone who asked how they could transfer their bitcoins from an exchange to another exchange. Everyone should know how to make a transaction securely, what to avoid and how to keep their bitcoins safe before buying. Today's dip proved that many people are ill prepared to be on this market.";1;0;False;Exotemporal;dqj49lt;BTC dropping due to lack of quality 11k memes.

"I have read about hodling since I bought last week. It was just about to drop below the price I bought in at, I panicked.... Luckily I keep my bitcoin in a wallet outside GDAX, the exchange crashed hard and transaction took forever. By the time my transaction was confirmed the price bounced up again, so I just lost txfees. Stupid, but less stupid than if I sold off my bitcoins.

So thank you whoever spams transactions and thanks Coinbase for crashing and having me rethink my decisions.
