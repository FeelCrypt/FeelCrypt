"Excuse me lol , I Am Trying a New social Experiment That has to do with the law of Attraction . One of the laws states that if you want something all you have to do is ask . So here i Find myself Contemplating if i should try it so here i go i am going to Just ask for Bitcoins once a day  for the next 30 days on any website that has a community of bitcoin users on it and see if it works i am sorry if it sounds annoying or stupid but i really want to test this theory  of just asking for what you want and in theory it will materialize so  i am expecting for the worst and nothing to come out of it but i want to see it through  and see if this actually works  Ill write a 777 word conclusion of my experiment after the 30 days . So here i go Can I please have some bitcoins ? :) Send them to this 17xp7zA8fqEEgSFd1dqVh6ozD6TycaHt5Q
