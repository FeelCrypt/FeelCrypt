To back you up even more- the Winklevoss twins view it as a store of value as well. There's a great book out about them that covers how they discovered it then led to Gemini etc. Supposedly they are still holding that initial Bitcoin and probably met Satoshi just didn't realize it;2;0;False;DacoLordo;expyi38;Reminder;cpb6co;https://i.redd.it/rrk1ulea80g31.jpg
Yes everyone has a different opinion on where bitcoin is going and nothing is certain. This is just my optimistic opinion. I believe one btc will be a large amount of wealth if and when bitcoin grows to dominate global currency markets. I can forsee a day where having one btc would be like someone today saying they are a millionaire. A sort of status statement and display of wealth. If you have more than one btc you made it, in the same way that if you have more than one million dollars you made it.;2;1;False;slvbtc;exq1y1v;Reminder;cpb6co;https://i.redd.it/rrk1ulea80g31.jpg
Where are you getting this information from? I've managed to accumulate 1btc I first got into it around $300 sold it all at $800 then just recently averaged in around $10k. I'm just curious to read the analysis or experts that say this is going to moon. Obviously I believe so but it doesn't seem as certain as you say.;1;1;False;DacoLordo;expzo83;Reminder;cpb6co;https://i.redd.it/rrk1ulea80g31.jpg
Cool well that's enough hype to fuel my excitement to more accumulation lol. People need to make sure to max out their Roth and 401k with some traditional stock ETFs at least that's what I do, auto paycheck deduction to safe stuff then if if in the unlikely case I lose my ass on Bitcoin I have a reasonable safety net in the retirement accounts.;1;1;False;DacoLordo;exq2r48;Reminder;cpb6co;https://i.redd.it/rrk1ulea80g31.jpg
Always good to have appropriate risk mitigation measures in place and use diversification to get your portfolio along the efficient frontier curve at the point of most potential reward for least amount of risk.;2;0;False;slvbtc;exq50hg;Reminder;cpb6co;https://i.redd.it/rrk1ulea80g31.jpg
