" you can get a used one for like 50-70 grand. That's what I'd do, if I got a lot of money and wanted a super car. Dodge Vipers, GTRs, LC 500s, Corvettes, Gallardos, etc. They're all 100 grand or less. 

Plus if you get a used supercar that has some mileage on it, you can actually drive it because it's no longer impeccably and most of its value was already lost to depreciation. I'd much rather drive an awesome car than let it sit in my garage. Might as well not have it in the latter case.

"The new tax reform fucks over the poor disproportionately and is generally kinda shitty. The personal exemption for a bigger deduction is not a good trade for example. Taxes can sometimes seem complicated but basically things got the way they did for a reason. The exemption and deduction are very different things which serve very different purposes.

The exemption is nothing more than a variable size 0% bracket linked to family size that exists under the other brackets. Logically you want that to be as high as reasonably possible and linked to cost of living, it exists to make sure that grocery/rent income isn't getting taxed. Currently it's set at $4,050 tax free dollars per household member.

The deduction is a completely different animal. The deduction exists to limit the tax penalties on socially positive expenses by allowing you to recover the taxes you paid on those expenses at your marginal tax rate. To reduce the cost of compliance you're allowed to assume $6,350 of socially positive expenses at the moment without providing proof. So you get taxes back at your marginal rate on the greater of $6,350 or what you can prove (with a bunch of bullshit Schedule A ceilings, floors, and other rules).

What this effectively means is that you ""win"" by having as few actually socially positive expenditures (charitable donations, paying for your own healthcare etc) as possible, giving you the biggest possible difference between your assumed $6,350 and what you actually spent. And you ""lose"" by having those expenditures at an amount near the assumed deduction, for example socially positive deductible expenditures of $6,400 would net you an additional refund of $12.50 ($50 * 25% tax bracket) over spending $0.

This tax plan abolishes the 0% bracket created by the exemptions. Now you're getting taxed on the poverty level living expenses with no allowance for family size etc. And it repays you by increasing the amount you can ""win"" by not making socially positive expenditures from ($6,350 * your marginal rate) to ($12,000 * your marginal rate).

What this means is that for anyone outside the 1% (where clearing $12k is a lot easier) most things just aren't deductible anymore.

Republicans like to say that the tax code is too complicated and that having exemptions + deductions is too hard but the people who built it knew what they were doing. And unfortunately so do the people voting to change it.

Probably the most obvious example of who this will hurt is anyone who regularly donates to charity (people who tithe at their church for example). But paying for your own healthcare expenses, paying state and local taxes, and a few things related to home ownership are all getting penalized.

The impact of that penalty decreases as the amount gets higher, someone who previously donated $13,000 goes from having a tax refund of $1,663 ((13,000-6,350) * assumed 25% tax rate) to $250 ((13,000-12,000) * assumed 25% tax rate). That's a 85% reduction in the tax benefit of charitable contributions for that person. Whereas someone who previously donated $130,000 goes from having a tax refund of $48,965 ((130,000-6,350) * assumed 39.6% tax rate) to $46,728 ((130,000-12,000) * assumed 39.6% tax rate). Their reduction is just 4% in their tax benefit.";0;1;False;Baron-of-bad-news;du5wc37;Insider tip: BTC is going to skyrocket in the next 48 hours;7x239n;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7x239n/insider_tip_btc_is_going_to_skyrocket_in_the_next/

">  the share of that that the rich are responsible for paying has gone down, while the share the middle class are responsible for paying has actually gone up.

That makes absolutely no sense. Are you saying the middle class pays more for it by keeping more of their money?

Also, the concept of a deficit (which isn't great, but the spending increase isn't that drastic) isn't explicitly debt. Pretending a nation's broke because it's spending more than it makes that year or that pretending that a country ever has to reach 0 debt is absurd.";0;1;False;umopapsidn;du6h7p8;Insider tip: BTC is going to skyrocket in the next 48 hours;7x239n;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7x239n/insider_tip_btc_is_going_to_skyrocket_in_the_next/
"The tax bill is closer to a flat tax than the status quo. It reduces the overall proportion of the total tax paid that the rich are paying considerably.

The government is spending more money than ever but the share of that that the rich are responsible for paying has gone down, while the share the middle class are responsible for paying has actually gone up.

Imagine you had previously planned to split an expense with another person where they pay $15 cash and you pay $5. They propose that you each put $10 on your credit card, insisting that that way you'll have an extra $5 in your pocket. The cash you have in your pocket might be slightly higher but the proportion of the overall liability that has to be paid has shifted against you.";1;1;False;Baron-of-bad-news;du6gpkg;Insider tip: BTC is going to skyrocket in the next 48 hours;7x239n;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7x239n/insider_tip_btc_is_going_to_skyrocket_in_the_next/

What are you talking about? Flat taxes are grossly regressive in practice. And no, tax plans and spending plans can be no more separated than revenues and expenses.

"A) It's not actually. There are plenty of conceivable situations in which you'll pay more tax under the new bill. Single provider households with multiple dependents are an obvious one.

B) It can only be paid for by slashing public services that the poor depend upon or massively running up the deficit.

Either way the poor are materially worse off.

It's no more a tax cut than a new credit card is a pay increase. All it does is hide the cost in the increased cost of government borrowing. The government is still spending money, more than ever, and the taxpayers still ultimately have to pay it. But the rich are now paying a lower proportion of it.

"I think in these days and times its a little naive to believe that the tax you pay makes a difference. The government through the central bank prints way too much money for whatever services they offer. Collecting tax off you at this point is a formality and not really needed.

Also Bitcoin is a brand new system you can't use the old tax tax system within this one. We need something new. Personally I believe taxes should be voluntary. If the government chose to be open and transparent about where tax money is spent, and I can see my money at work and not just used to kill people in another country I'd happily drop them a few satoeshis.

I've seen many posts about taxation and Bitcoin. It baffles me how much people want to pay tax, you can pay my share if you like :p

"**Operation Snow White**

Operation Snow White was a criminal conspiracy by the Church of Scientology during the 1970s to purge unfavorable records about Scientology and its founder, L. Ron Hubbard. This project included a series of infiltrations into and thefts from 136 government agencies, foreign embassies and consulates, as well as private organizations critical of Scientology, carried out by Church members in more than 30 countries. It was one of the largest infiltrations of the United States government in history, with up to 5,000 covert agents. This operation also exposed the Scientology plot 'Operation Freakout', because Operation Snow White was the case that initiated the U.S. government's investigation of the Church.

If you really want a response.. Well no I don't expect anything from anyone. I am only observing people expressing themselves regardless of the topic that the boars has been labeled.. Some repeat what others say while others construct what others should be saying.

Fiat currency has the advantage of a government working to ensure that the value doesn't drop like that. It's not perfect but it's better than completely no-holds-barred economic anarchy.";1;1;False;DoxBox;du5vvns;Thought I might share this in here.

"**Hyperinflation in Zimbabwe**

Hyperinflation in Zimbabwe was a period of currency instability that began in the late 1990s shortly after the confiscation of private farms from landowners, towards the end of Zimbabwean involvement in the Second Congo War. During the height of inflation from 2008 to 2009, it was difficult to measure Zimbabwe's hyperinflation because the government of Zimbabwe stopped filing official inflation statistics. However, Zimbabwe's peak month of inflation is estimated at 79.6 billion percent in mid-November 2008.

In 2009, Zimbabwe stopped printing its currency, with currencies from other countries being used.

"Bitcoin just had more inflation over a two day period than any currency in history. Inflation is the drop in value of a currency, not the printing of more currency. 

More currency being printed will obviously cause inflation, but it's not the primary cause of inflation in most modern currencies because we have many, many examples of why printing more money only makes things worse.

Bitcoin is unstable. That's the fact. It goes up in value, it goes down in value, hard in both directions. It deflates (goes up in value, meaning you require less of it for the same purchase) or inflates (goes down in value, meaning you require more of it for the same purchase).

Bitcoin is actually *lesser* than fiat currency.

It used to be that currencies were backed by gold and silver reserves, held by the country that issued the currency and paid out to the bearer of currency notes.

Some decades back, most of the world switched to fiat. Rather than backed by the gold and silver reserves of the country that issued the currency, they are backed by that government's credit rating. A bit more risky to hold currency, but still not backed by *nothing*.

Bitcoin is backed by nothing.

People act like it being non-fiat currency is a good thing, but, it's not. It's a house of cards.
