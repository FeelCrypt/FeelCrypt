"> You have to lock coins into a channel for it to be useful. 

This is going to be true of ANY payment channel. Fundamentally, you will need to lock funds to get a payment channel advantage. Otherwise, how would you get funds into the channel? Sure, you could make a new transaction every time you want funds in the payment channel, but then why even make a payment channel?

And to prove this is true, think about the payment channel you (likely) use almost every day: VISA. You can't hold cash and use VISA. You have to ""lock"" your cash into a bank or credit union account. While it is in that bank account, you cannot use the cash accept through the payment channel. 

Knowing this, let's examine your other assertions:

> This means users will want to maintain as few channels as possible

Maybe. Maybe not. The only thing keeping me from getting multiple bank accounts at multiple banks is...oh wait. I do have multiple bank accounts at multiple banks. And now with other apps like Venmo, PayPal, Cash, Dwolla, etc, I have a bunch of payment channels open.

> most merchants will maintain a channel with their exchange (for the same reason)

Yep. I would want one of those too. 

> once one of them fails, that's gonna be a LOT of transactions to settle on a chain

Yeah, but many more transactions would have been on chain without it. Though I do agree that the timing kinda sucks since they are all racing to get on the chain. But hey, at least there is recourse. If a bank suddenly went under, you'd be screwed (well, FDIC, but that's different). 

I appreciate you bringing up potential flaws. It's always good to think these things through. But I think your arguments work against any potential payment channel. And because of that, they don't work at all. There will always be some advantage to payment channels, specifically in speed and fees. And you shouldn't stop people from wanting to take advantage of these features. That would be blocking progress.";6;1;False;jkandu;dkklajy;Miners right now.;6otydy;http://i.gifntext.com/XONq3rINt7.gif

"> When you cut off a portion of your genitals, you are literally.

*Sigh*


You really want to run this out in a bitcoin subreddit, I can tell. Okay...

As you must know, genital mutilation, as practiced in Muslim countries, impairs the function of the genitalia. A circumcised penis, if anything, functions *better* than an uncircumcised penis (source: [Center for Disease Control](https://www.cdc.gov/healthcommunication/toolstemplates/entertainmented/tips/hivcircumcision.html)).

Since I'm feeling charitable, here's some more information that you also seem to lack: The penis and clitoris are homologous structures. The *literal* equivalent of the Islamic practice of removing the clitoris would be removing the entire penis, not removing the foreskin.

> your little -7 needs a source.

That was levity. Since my self-worth and identity aren't bound up in this issue, I'm comfortable joking about it. Since you don't seem to be aware, it's impossible to have ""negative seven people"".

The 2x part then takes the effective block size to 4mb, 4x what nodes have to digest now.

It absolutely does not. It's called layer 2 for a reason. It is absolutely convoluted (off chain transactions are by definition a hack). It doesn't increase the block size and it doesn't increase capacity. What it essentially does is create a secondary network through tunnels opened up by people (and tunnel hubs) to get money to where it needs to go. Where bitcoin layer 1 is publishing txs to a public ledger that wallets monitor for addresses they own, segwit is like traveling through a shit ton of country roads (which a really weird road map) to find someone. It's an interesting concept that anyone is free to never use but make no mistake, it does not increase capacity nor the block size.

Where is the point going that far, do you even know the tx volume peak? You can just raise it above where it is now and see. There is no point in doubling or even quadrupling instantly when you could make gradual increases. And as we are already getting an increase that comes close to double, why not take the opportunity to observe, instead of advocating for yet another change before looking at it?

"Right. if you go up two levels, you did say that. I replied specifically to the comment where you argued that LN causes centralization and only quoted from that. 

> Its not that payment channels are bad per se

Payment channels aren't bad period. They are the only thing that could be considered ""True Scaling"". Increasing the blocksize is not ""Scaling"" because it would be linear at best, and sub-linear most likely. Blocksize changes also don't help the fundamental problems with widespread adoption which is that transactions need 10 minutes average to confirm, and require fees relative to the byte-size of the transaction. Payment channels are the only things that fix this. 

I'm all for an upgrade to 2MB too. But I wish y'all wouldn't rush it. We as a community have been working on segwit for years now with myriads of tests and copious amounts of planning. We should do the same for a block-size increase. And I know the politics of the issue are strange. But the big-blockers need to quit bitching and plan a change the right way.

From what I read I assumed the big issue is that the pipe is too small for the amount of liquid being put through, to borrow a phrase. When the block chain is hit with all these tiny payments exactly as they come in processing is a nightmare, even worse when they try and do a batch, because the block chain size doesn't support say, a store that wants to verify transactions all day and wait until after business is closed to send out the batch of everything.

SegWit was intended to be the compromise.

"I'm by no means an expert in the situation, but this is what I'm seeing.  Segwit2x was a compromise between the users/some miners who wanted Segwit and the miners who wanted 2MB block sizes.  The users switched their nodes to BIP148 nodes to enforce Segwit while the miners signaled their support for Segwit2x.  The miners are now signaling Segwit, but the 2MB fork isn't planned to be adopted for 3 months.  Right now we effectively have Segwit with a normal 1MB block size.  If the users continue to enforce BIP148 on their nodes, then the chain will probably be split in 3 months when the 2MB blocks is supposed to take effect.  Depending on who goes down what path, his could be bad.  The BIP148 chain could lose a lot of miners, so transactions would take a very long time.  The Segwit2x chain could have a shitbucket of miners with no transactions to mine.  A consensus would eventually come out of the turmoil, but it could cause some damage to people's confidence in the currency.

Personally, I think we should honor Segwit2x.  It's a short term compromise, but it will keep the community together while we fix some of the issues in a less chaotic way.  Both will help a little with some scaling problems as well.  I think a lot of people talking about enforcing BIP148 after the Segwit2x fork are worried about the growing power of mining pools which is a legitimate concern.  I also think that there are ways to put some mining power into the hands of normal users and decentralize the process, but we shouldn't nuke the chain before the protocols exist.";6;0;False;;dkktk4l;Miners right now.;6otydy;http://i.gifntext.com/XONq3rINt7.gif

"Segwit with no further on chain scaling is very different from segwit with a reasonable outlook that on chain scaling will actually happen.

Note that the original HK agreement already contained pretty much exactly what was now decided as segwit2x, minus technical enforcement, but the ""2x"" part of it was sabotaged.

One reason for the strong opposition to segwit-only was that there would be a strong incentive for off-chain system peddlers to sabotage further on chain scaling once they had what they needed. With real on chain scaling happening within 3-4 months, this is less of a concern. The problem isn't so much segwit (although it is an ugly hack introducing way too much complexity), but the ""not scaling"" that may result from activating it. (Lightning network, OTOH, is just dangerous nonsense that would cause centralization and then fail horribly when one such centralized node blows uo.)

The risk that an agreed-upon, locked in fork would not happen is lower than the risk that a vague agreement (the HK one) will break apart as has happened. I still consider the risk too high as smallblockers will certainly spend the next 3 months trying to prevent the 2x part of the compromise, but with overwhelming miner support for the 2x fork and having already provided segwit, that will not be as easy as it was to delay the whole thing by *two damn years*.

I would be *much* happier with an agreement that did both at the same time, but sadly, miners considered ""in 3 months"" enough of a concession. Let's just hope that a mining supermajority enforces the whole part of the agreement.

"impossible without mountains of context behind it. 

* You'd need to have a solid understanding on money to understand why people give a shit about cryptocurrency.
* You'd need a solid understanding of cryptography to understand how bitcoin works and why it is secure
* You'd need to understand inflation just enough to know why it's harmful and unsustainable
* You'd need to understand the history of anyone in power and how their behavior changes when they come into power. There's potentially trillions of dollars at stake in the future, you'd be crazy to think no one is going to try to pull some shady shit in order to control that.

* You'd have to understand the tribal nature of humans. Most people aren't going to have the necessary required knowledge so they'll just pick a ""side"". In an echo chamber such as this one, you really only get to pick one side.

* You'd have to understand the history of the Bitcoin scaling debates. ""Teams"" began to form out of a position that didn't exist before. In 2009-2015~ Everyone used to be FOR scaling, except every possible argument in favor of scaling started to be attacked as ""dangerous"", ""risky"", ""damages decentralization"", ""untested"", ""too quick"", etc. etc.

* You'd have to understand how Bitcoin upgrades itself through soft/hard fork mechanisms , and what ""consensus"" means according to the code. The problem is this definition gets warped exactly the way scaling did.

* You'd need to have been involved with the community from the start to know who the toxic players are and who are the ones trying to improve the space. 

So an explanation would do you no good. Any person's summary would most likely skew the reality of the situation with their own bias. In this case, it'd be that of the hivemind (thank god bitcoin is wayyyyyyyy larger than just this subreddit).

However, If you give enough of a shit to see why people care, I do suggest you start with researching money. Start with the properties of what makes money good. Start with why we even use money instead of bartering. Then look into gold. Why was gold valuable over money? Why is gold STILL valuable?

"The system is tuned so that (on average) a *""block""* of transactions is generated every 10 minutes.

- the size of a block of transactions is limited to being `1,000,000 bytes`
- It takes (on average) `627 bytes` to store a transaction

That means that BitCoin is limited (on average) to:

- 1,000,000 / 627 = `1,596 transactions per block`

And since a block is generated (on average) every `10 minutes`, it means that BitCoin is limited to:

- `229,834 transactions/day`

The size of blocks started small; but [since 2009 has hit the limit](https://blockchain.info/charts/avg-block-size?timespan=all):

- http://i.imgur.com/fY1elz0.png

Limiting the[ transaction volume that BTC can deliver:](https://blockchain.info/charts/n-transactions?timespan=all)

- http://i.imgur.com/k60CQHn.png

That is with today's limit of 1MB per block. The maximum size of a block has changed over time (e.g. [256 KB in 2013](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=289967.0)). It was the intention of the original designer of the protocol that the maximum block size be periodically be increased. Hell, [*originally* it was 32MB:](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/479afa0f8486146a35f1fb96be1826061ecbcf23/src/serialize.h#L26)

    MAX_SIZE = 0x02000000; 

It was time for *yet another* block size increase; this time to **2 MB** - hence the name: 

> SegWit`2x` - **2x** for **2×1MB**.

But there was much opposition to increasing the block size to 2MB. People who have set up huge BitCoin mining farms don't want twice the data flowing [over their slow, government firewalled, Internet](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/6ot88y/internet_speed_and_cost_by_country_oc/). 

So a compromise was created:

- we'll make the transactions slightly smaller (sacrificing some minor security detail) 
- and in exchange we'll increase the limit to 2MB anyway

It's a **take your medicine** type of situation.

- people opposed to raising the block size limit get to be happy
- while we raise the block size limit

"Segwit is a a software upgrade to Bitcoin. It would allow the scaling of Bitcoin without having do a hard fork of the bitcoin chain. The main developers think unnecessary hard forks are bad and want to include many different upgrades when they do one.

Segwit was an amazing solution to this problem, but would compromise an advantage one major mining cartel had called asicboost.  This advantage was hidden for a long time and it was not known why they were anti segwit.  Massive legions of paid Reddit posters flooded r/BTC for Long time convincing many people that were not tech savvy the miners were underdogs and simply knew better than the devs what the path of Bitcoin should be. IE no segwit and immediate hard fork to unlimited blocks or larger blocks or a few other simplistic solutions that usually failed on test net.

A few months ago it was realized the previously mentioned mining cartel had a hidden advantage in mining known as asicboost.. It cleared the air and made it obvious the reason they were blocking segwit. This advantage would go away with segwit and all the hardware he produced would no longer have it's advantage.

He essentially stalled the progress of Bitcoin in order to make more money.

So many people got confused over this mess and devoted to an unneccary blocksize increase that segwit2x was born as a compromise/ face saving deal for the miners so they don't look like they gave in.

It's pretty interesting and I think most people don't understand the complex political history here.  If you could read r/BTC at times it really looked like a weird propaganda subreddit with massive amounts of similar posts with no content making it look like the miners naive solution had support.  Very interesting history to this that goes back a long way.";140;9;False;sweeptheleg55;dkkipe0;Miners right now.;6otydy;http://i.gifntext.com/XONq3rINt7.gif
"There is a big debate on how Bitcoin transactions should be processed in the future and the result is a power struggle between different groups of miners (those who process transactions with computer hardware) and software developers.

"OK so hold up, two things here:

1. Segwit, by allowing transactions to exist off-chain, indirectly increases capacity (An unknown but likely large amount, tied to the success of the 'layer 2' off-chain protocol introduced, eg Lightning Network), where capacity = number of transactions per block. You are correct in this context in that Segwit itself isn't literally adding the capacity, but the protocols that it enables do and it would seem very disingenuous to not acknowledge that fact.

2. Segwit does more than just enable side chains. It is a small package of improvements of which side-chains are one item. Another thing it does is re-organize the storage of 'witness' data into a separate data store outside of the block (Thus the name). This change itself *does* directly add capacity, because it means the block itself now has more storage space for transaction data (Equivalent to 1.5MB - 1.8MB non-segwit blocks).";1;0;False;freeradicalx;dkkslvg;Miners right now.;6otydy;http://i.gifntext.com/XONq3rINt7.gif
