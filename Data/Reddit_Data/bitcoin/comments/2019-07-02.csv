"Has to do with the [Moiré pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moir%C3%A9_pattern).

A good answer with more specific information for computer screens:
> This is moiré. It occurs because a screen is actually a grid of squares that are being used to make the image. When it ends up trying to be mapped to another grid of pixels (either by being captured by a sensor or by scaling) points of light or pixel data don't line up exactly. Some pixels get 2 pixels of information, some get the border between pixels. The Wikipedia article I linked to has far more detail available on it. It can happen any time that two grids interact (such as taking a picture of a skyscraper from a distance.
> 
> In the case of scaling particularly, if you have multiple pixels per screen display pixel, the actual effective resolution of your image is limited to whatever you were taking a photo of (there isn't more than about 2MP of information on most computer displays). What happens with the extra pixels on your camera is that they actually take an image of what the screen looks like, so you get multiple pixels for each screen pixel and some that overlap borders.
> 
> When you scale that down, particularly depending on the algorithm used, you can end up with moiré emerging because pixels that were on the border between pixels get too much weight, resulting in darker areas. This actually happens a little bit with any kind of remap, but if it isn't two grids of evenly spaced points, you don't get enough of a pattern for it to be super noticeable like it is in your sample image.

"BTC is without doubt the first to move from the wallet from which you're intending to separate your forked coins.

However, the decision to move your BCH next isn't as straightforward. BSV doesn't have replay protection meaning if you try next to send your BCH before actively splitting off the BSV you may find you've also inadvertently sent your BSV - and if that's straight to an exchange BCH address, you may not get it back! So whatever you think of these forks, it may be worth learning enough about them split safely.

Then you can decide how much of each to keep as the forked coin, sell for fiat or (as 99% of people here would advocate) 'dump' them all for BTC :)";2;1;False;pretentiousername;esm9dfk;Sooo.. I've found my old wallet back after almost 6 years.;c86sap;https://i.redd.it/k1ns29ifru731.jpg

"Digging and learning more is never a bad idea.  Cryptocurrency is really useful tech that isn't going to just go away, and I think it doesn't need to usurp fiat altogether to have a place in this world.  One of the first steps might be to just go with something like Cash App and buy $1, $5, $10 worth - something you really wouldn't lose any sleep over if something happened.  It doesn't have to be hundreds or thousands of dollars worth.

It used to be that you could buy and sell BTC in Cash App, and could transfer BTC out to an external wallet, but you couldn't transfer BTC to Cash App to sell.  Now they are adding the ability to transfer in, so it functions more like a wallet on Coinbase.  You could store it there for a while if you wanted to, and you can take some time researching and playing with the various wallets, learn concepts for cold storage, look at things like the Ledger or Trezor, and decide for yourself how you would store and handle it long term.  General advice is to not leave a lot of coins on an exchange, but I'm not sure I'd be too concerned over a couple of dollars worth while getting my feet wet.";1;0;False;ParkerGuitarGuy;esln03h;Sooo..

I hope so.  It’s a fun time to dream. I used to have 100 btc back in late 2012.  But I had spent them all on about 25 hits of LSD, I was pretty sure.  But when BTC was on the 2017 run, I still dug out my old hard drive to fire up the wallet and check if I had been smart enough to just leave one or two measly BTC in there.  It was a wild thought for a couple hours while the wallet got verified. But nope, my ass was too “smart” to ever discharge an old pc without emptying all the crypto off it first, even if it was only worth $5.;37;3;False;McBurger;eslqpz9;Sooo..

If you are just another face in the crowd of 7.53 billion people in the world that may or may not have any coins, then there is no compelling reason for them to spend their time targeting you - trying to identify you, and identify any particular system weaknesses they could exploit to gain access to your funds.

"I think the majority of people who are millionaires because of BTC are just lucky they forgot about their hardrive or USB stick with a BTC wallet and stumbled across it years later. Very few people really saw the potential Im sure.

Thinking about it, if you were in 2012 and you had 1000 BTC you wouldnt think about holding it as an investment. It wasnt meant to be an investment in the first place ( P2P currency and later the drug currency ) so the logical thing to do back then was to spend it. Now there are a lot of people who regret not doing things differently, but you/me/anyone simply wouldnt know what would happen to BTC in the future so why would anyone regret anything?

Think about it this way, what if you really thought it was an investment. Ok, you bought at $30 and it went to $350. Wow, thats over 10x ROI in a relatively short period of time. Such a thing is uncanny and unheard of in traditional markets so you would probably have sold because you already made a big return. But guess what happens years later.... 

The choice we made to be in this space is a choice from a perspective that things will be better in the future. I think that is what most of us should focus on instead of the past.

No matter what choices I would have made in life, all of them would have had difficulties, and there's no reason to dwell on what I could have done differently.";34;7;False;DontTrustJack;esmcby1;Sooo.. I've found my old wallet back after almost 6 years.;c86sap;https://i.redd.it/k1ns29ifru731.jpg

"Alright guys, It just finished downloading everything.. And the end-result is not what I expected, but in the end I didnt really wanted to expect anything at all.

Lets start with saying that it was not 0 BTC..>! !<

When the download nearly finished, I could not refrain myself from having a quick sneak-peek at the Blockchain Explorer, like some of you have advised me to do.At first thought I didn't  want to know what was in the wallet, but eventualy I snapped and just had to check it.

&#x200B;

So, with no further ado:

>!There was 0.246 BTC on the account.. !<

&#x200B;

I could really hit myself in the head for not buying more at that time, but hey! It's a nice extra, and had some exciting fun!

I hope I'm not disappointing  any of you with the (a bit lower than hoped for) outcome!

I'm gonna get a model-version of my lambo, and hope to see BTC hit an ATH very soon!

&#x200B;

Thanks for sticking with me on this wild ride!

&#x200B;

Cheers!
