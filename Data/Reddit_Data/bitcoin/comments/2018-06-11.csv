"The major components are the cards, and they'll range between 250-700 per card depending on make and model number. With today's fall, an average 6 card rig on the Nvidia side with higher end units, will bring in about $8-10 a day in profit. An RX580 rig from the AMD side will bring in about $4.75-$5.15 per day in profit. 

The Nvidia's generally create more revenue and use less wattage, but cost more initially to setup. The AMDs are much cheaper but require more attention to setup and get running correctly. Resale value falls to the nvidia side considerably. 

If I were to build a cheap and powerful miner today, I'd try to find a deal on some RX580 8g's, slap a cheap Celeron processor on a B250 mining expert board with 8g ram, run her on SMOS and call it good.

"> I think the majority of wealthy people are wealthy due to savvy investment and sound businesses

> That 40% of that pool did not have access to the generational wealth that you claim is the prerequisite for any wealth supports my position 

Pick one please. I took the Forbes 400 data because they don't have data about wealthy people in general and how they got their wealth. If your logic stands, it shouldn't make a difference how wealthy they ended up. Aside from most of my points you ignored in this comment that I think refuted most of your premise, like getting rich off of sound investments that the majority of people can't even afford to make, I find that the rest of your conclusions are leaps in logic. 

It is common knowledge that being born wealthy equates to having much more access to wealth, and that the gap of rich and poor and  staggeringly increasing costs of college tution and limited access to basic requirements like health insurance are making it nearly impossible to be born poor and end up rich in today's economy. Most rich CEO's started out when college tuitions with inflation rate were cents on the dollar to what they are now, and you could get a job right out of high school to support a family of four. They could ""become wealthy just by working hard."" Doesn't apply anymore. It didn't take a $80,000 college tuition to even have a chance.";3;1;False;greatwhitebuffalo716;e0gedt8;Nope;8q2gwk;http://www.bitcoininvestr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/leonardo-dicaprio-not-fucking-selling-700x475.jpg

It doesn't matter how many copies there are of bitcoin. Some will become valuable for other reasons Bitcoin can't fufill, but Bitcoin is and will be valuable because many people hold it and also because many bussinesses will build on top of it. The more a network / system is used the more valuable it will be. The longer bitcoin is around the more trusted it is for its security, liquidity, store of value, and if lightening becomes a success it will be trusted for quick, fast and easy smaller payments. Of course becoming more stable is a much needed feature too, but if bitcoin gets  to trillions of dollars market cap, we will see much less volatility. But also before then you have much more volatile currencies around the world, so it will become appealing to them people, especially those who's banks do not serve them well. You also have bussiness that will use it as a backend payment system, so people that use apps like Abra's to send money back home from a different country will not necessarily know they are using bitcoin to send money. I believe at some point we could see many banking apps around the world using bitcoin as like the TCP/IP to transfer money from one person to the next, even if they are using a different bank from a different country. True, there is always a chance another one takes the crown, but it is not an easy crown to take. Even a far superior system that doesn't use a blockchain and has built in scalability would take a long time to become the number one crypto, because it requires years of trust. ;2;0;False;dreamersonder;e0hauzw;Nope;8q2gwk;http://www.bitcoininvestr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/leonardo-dicaprio-not-fucking-selling-700x475.jpg
"- The best computer scientists (such as those in MIT) in the world volunteering and doing peer review on every single line of code and working full time on layer 2 tech.  Bitcoin has more updates and more code review than any other project out there.  And noone is paid to do it.  Moreover, there are logs of every single decision going back 9 years...  These decisions require consensus and have to happen in the open over transparent IRC, GitHub and LinuxDev mailing lists.

- In total, there are 5 constituents of consensus required... keeping the code and the network resistant to any kind of takeover attempt.

- The biggest distributed network on planet earth that comprises the miners keeping the network secure.

- Huge institutional investment and regulatory clarity that have assured bitcoin's future (CBOE, CME, ETF likely sooner than expected, solid KYC and responsible entities like coinbase partnering with the likes of Barclays).

- Prominent tech giants and knowledgeable folks at Microsoft backing Bitcoin as being the only realistic candidate for their forthcoming decentralised identify platform (and their billion Windows users).

- Leading internet luminaries (Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, Apple Engineer Steve Wozniak) saying they hope to see Bitcoin become the world's global currency.  Similar support from the likes of Paul Graham of Y-Combinator (which Airbnb/Dropbox/Reddit came from).

- Like the internet, Bitcoin has no brand or leaders that can be coerced / sued.

- It requires no advertising or PR.  People found bitcoin through word of mouth and fell in love with the idea.  

- Massive real world adoption and organic promotion.  Bitcoin cafes, 1000s of meetup groups, conferences, pop songs, movie and TV show appearances, art works, ATMs.

- Huge online infrastructure and support.  Many huge brands from Dell and Microsoft to Expedia and Namecheap have been accepting bitcoin for nearly half a decade.  Many 100s of small merchants onboarding daily.

- Tens of millions of ordinary users with accounts at exchanges already established.

- Safe storage solutions such as dedicated hardware wallets like Trezor

- Nearly a million Reddit followers and the widest social media following

- The most diverse userbase spanning all social strata / country / ethnicity

- 9 years of resilience and 100% uptime.

- Lots of [colourful personalities](https://youtu.be/YA1k8Rz583U) and creatives doing things that give us all a smile and a giggle when things are being taken too seriously, making this one of the most fun, exciting (and generous) communities on the planet.  

- It's also a school.  Amongst all that fun, people in here and on bitcointalk of all ages and backgrounds are learning about everything from history and economics to applied cryptography and high level programming.  

- Bitcoin has its own [satellite network](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/blockstream-satellite-broadcasting-bitcoin-space/) which means the blockchain can be hooked into from anywhere on the globe even in areas that don't have internet (all that is required is a $20 used satellite dish and a few modifications).

"With lightning network running on Layer 2 the transaction fees will be close to zero.  The main bitcoin blockchain then becomes a settlement layer only settling large transactions.  So then you think of Layer 1 as the most secure store of value on the planet, Layer 2 as the fastest most decentralised payment channel on the planet that will ultimately scale way beyond Visa and be far more secure.  There's some Layer 3 stuff that comes after that which is just completely mind blowing.

"Exactly, do you see how you're listening to a scientist explaining the truth as it is today?  At the moment bitcoin is a store of value.  Just as 
web 1.0 at the beginning was a cool way of connecting images and information but was not yet ready for things like video streaming (although we could see it would be with more development).

So... As Andreas explains when he says ""yes, I believe it can become currency when it can scale via Layer 2 technology"" he is explaining what is going to happen when things like Lightning Network (which came from those [clever scientists at MIT](https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/lit/overview/)) can eventually move billions of transactions per second around at close to zero cost.

Lightning has just gone into beta and is already performing far better than anyone expected after just a year of development.  

Of course these teething issues aren't anything we haven't all been aware of and anticipating (hence all the work going on in MIT).  

Indeed, way back in 2013 Facebook executive and Social+Capital Fund partner Chamath Palihapitiya explained exactly how all of this was going to unfold and was absolutely correct.

>Palihapitiya says: 

""I personally own Bitcoin in my hedge fund, I own Bitcoin in my fund, I own Bitcoin in my private account. It is a huge deal. It's a huge, huge, huge deal. Because what you're talking about right now is **for the next three to five years, an unbelievably better stored value. It is gold 2.0. Right?** The value of gold that hedges the world economy, about $9 trillion, right? Thirteen hundred an ounce, of which only a hundred to a hundred and fifty dollars is the actual production value. So all the rest is imputed.... Well, guess what? I can do the same thing with Bitcoin only I can do it outside the purview of every single government. **It's being used everywhere you would think it would be used. Russia, Iran, Iraq, Egypt, Venezuela, Argentina. Everywhere you have currency pressure.** Everywhere you want to basically shield your assets. **And then, after that, it will probably become a payment mechanism.**""

See: [Facebook Executive says Bitcoin Is Gold 2.0 - It's a Huge, Huge, Huge Deal!](https://youtu.be/G6iIhooV8UY).

"I'm sorry but that sounds incredibly naive to me. People born rich, and their parents, can and do invest their wealth and not become broke pretty easily. By your logic, many wealthy people would sit on their cash and become poor (?).

According to a study, United for a Fair Economy looked into the Forbes 400 list and found at least 61.5% of them were born into wealth. And those people tend to be older and had economies that were much more conducive to the ""American Dream"" when they became adults, when the gap between the rich and poor wasn't as huge as it is now. And this is ignoring the many advantages wealthy kids have of getting into good colleges and having connections to well-paying jobs, which is infinitely more pronounced now than 20+ years ago.

Edit: Also, it takes a substantial amount of money to be able to make ""savvy investments"" to make wealth.

"Apparently our definitions of ""high income"" are vastly different. You make 125k sound like a pauper's salary, but [ 125k is in the 92nd percentile for income](https://dqydj.com/income-percentile-calculator/), which would certainly qualify as a high income in my mind. 

In California, [a household earning of 233k puts you into the 95th percentile]( https://statisticalatlas.com/state/California/Household-Income). So, according to your rule, less than 5% of Californians are ""true middle class"" since that doesn't kick in until 400k.

I think your understanding of where the middle class ends and the upper class begins is skewed, and maybe that is why you believe 50-60% income tax is common for the wealthy. In reality, only 1% of Americans even reach the top federal income tax, and far fewer make enough that the effective rate nears the marginal rate.

"There is an infinite amount of fiat, but a fixed supply of bitcoin.

When you look at the price swings with that in mind, its almost comical that people sell for fiat. The dollar *must* go down over time. There is an inexorable inescapable gravity pulling on it. There is a great big wall holding back an ocean of dollars, and it only takes the tiniest of leaks to flood the market with cheap dolla bills.

We are like the netherlands, but perhaps a mile deep with mountainous damns, swarming with engineers rushing to fix each crack and plug each leak. And yet, traders are betting against the ever rising tide, the leviathan weight of the ocean.

It could easily go to 5k, but it could also easily go to 50k. No one really knows where this road goes and no amount of data will tell the future.

For a time, this may indeed be true.  In the meantime I suggest everyone reduce or eliminate all leverage in their positions, and when possible keep most of their bitcoin in their own possession and off exchanges.  I believe this will pass and then you truly will see confidence being lost worldwide in the current legacy financial system.

">Well, good thing you arent the physical manifestation of the humanities

The consensus of people does not equal the objective morality of an idea. I'm not here to trash\-talk Marx, I simply dislike/disagree with his ideas and think he oversimplified some pretty complex issues without sufficient evidence. My apologies for the snarky comment before, but in all seriousness, if his accomplishment was a framework for thinking about social issues, there have definitely been far greater contributers before and since.";1;0;False;;e0hymto;HODL;8pl9zu;https://i.redd.it/a4ouas9fzs211.jpg
