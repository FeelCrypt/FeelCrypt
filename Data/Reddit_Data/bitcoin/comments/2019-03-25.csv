"Wew there, hostile much?

Its an adversarial space with a lot of vested interests from various partys yes, so a lot of bad actors and 'FUDSTERS'. Who are you trying to tell that there aren't? Where've you been? Have you not seen the countless replys and votespammmed shitposts that just shit all over btc with pointless quips? I'm guessing you have.

Yep, various partys make censorship a talking point while simultaneously brazenly censoring and using it to exploit the naive. What is wrong with shutting down the most obvious trolls, and gently steering things back to a state of optimism and information?

""Totally delusional""... lol totally not trolling huh?  Nice try bud.

Edit:
>you believe in cryptocurrency. You're not qualified to judge your own mental state.  

Ah, there it is, always obvious with you lot. Maybe work out who you're angry with and why, trolling wont fix your fkup.  

Looks like you got caught brigading on your astroturfing/troll accounts and suspended, who would've guessed. cya.";1;1;False;thesean_glider;ejbt0og;So you don't get robbed...;b26qxy;https://i.redd.it/riv6dcyoepm21.jpg
