"Well the fear of missing the train and understanding the importance of the underlying technology.
 I first heard about it in around 2013-14. I didn't dig deep, just saw and thought yeah its cool stuff, lets see if this works out or not. Then in 2015 i saw that the price has now shot up and I can't afford even one bitcoin as I used to spend all my pocket money on not-so-important things and saved a negligible amount. I also thought, I will buy when i could afford atleast 1BTC. Then came 2016, I went lil deep and was impressed with the tech. Meanwhile life took a different turn, a lot of things happened and everything started settled down in around Nov-Dec. Since then i kept a constant watch on its price waiting for dip and also procrastinating a lil (yeah i know dumb. Right?) finally got a lil this year. From 2016 Nov-Dec i kept my Mom in loop about the prices and I didn't convince anyone in my family or friends. I bought a lil from the money which was mine cuz I know the prices are volatile and if i went on convincing i would have been even more late to the party. Also the difference between USD and INR also played a big role in delaying.";4;0;False;nishchayapallav;dl2kkn7;Learn how to buy bitcoin.;6r318q;http://i.imgur.com/uQChu9E.jpg

This was circa 2010 and while I thought it sounded a little interesting, it didn't seem to make any sense.  Man I wish i had done a quick google search on it!
