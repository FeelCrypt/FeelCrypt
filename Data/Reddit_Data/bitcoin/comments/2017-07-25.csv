"> Humans think the machines are keeping them alive as a power source. That doesn't make any sense scientifically speaking. . . .

You only think that because you learned the ""matrix science"" the machines wanted you to know (like the conservation-of-energy principle).  You can't assume that the in-movie, human-world physics follows the same rules you know.

(I did not come up with this theory, but was talking to an eight year old who had just seen the movie and dropped this theory on me when I argued that humans don't have net energy surplus.  I was damn impressed.  Kid blew my mind.)";1;1;False;hottake_toothache;dkokcrg;Every GPU's worst nightmare;6mjng5;https://i.redd.it/rkwou70jut8z.jpg

"You support Jihan, Ver & Co's hostile takeover attempts.

As is extremely clear.  Constantly spamming anti-bitcoin propaganda like you (and your colleagues) do.

It's very easy to spot.  lol, you people really need a new script.

If you are truely independant of Jihan's destructive schemes, but still fully support them,

then your motives are bad, and your goals also to be discouraged with extreme prejudice.

This latest of Jihan's desperate hijacking manouvers, 2x, is one in a LONG line.  They all have been denied again and again.

You can tell all the stories you want, but willy-nilly upping the block size is not the way forward. More mining power centralization is the LAST thing Bitcoin needs.

SegWit, and all the SAFE scaling measures it opens the door to must be fully explored first.  

Now that bad actors such as Jihan and his unscrupulous mining concerns (include yourself if you see fit) have been forced to FINALLY signal SegWit by the threat of a UASF,

finally Bitcoin can start doing this important work.

Until these safe and sane options are exhausted, there is zero need for any discussion about increasing block size.

We've all had plenty enough of you and your your cronies' ""Big Blocks NOW!"" propaganda.

Give it a rest, or go tell your stories over on /btc where such disinformation is welcome.  It is well known for promoting abusive snake oil salesmen like Jihan, Ver (and it seems you want to include yourself) in their anti-Bitcoin, anti-crypto, anti-Open Source schemes.";1;1;False;Terminal-Psychosis;dkotfw1;Miners right now.;6otydy;http://i.gifntext.com/XONq3rINt7.gif
I see everyone says its dumb but i think its actually quite a good idea if you follow the price and notice trends and buy and sell acordingly it could be a great source of income something else you could do is use it to buy a mining contract but thats even riskier.;1;0;False;dnlslm9;dkofkb5;When I invested in BTC and it isn't giving me my expected 34524% returns;6jsaq4;https://i.redd.it/6hsumcajk66z.jpg
