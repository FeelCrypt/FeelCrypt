"You gotta watch the terminology before you get bent out of shape about it - the network itself worked as expected. This is a classic case of client not robust enough, but some people on here are going to celebrate, because their share of code worked perfectly. It's to be expected.

The hard part is going to be how to determine which client isn't going to have problems like this. ""State"" is a new concept for clients which previously just had the state of a 12 word seed which users knew to back up somewhere. The best solution for how to handle state in this case will be obvious in hindsight.

As an aged software developer and IT guy, I like to see as little state as possible kept on a client (e.g. your smart phone) specifically because catastrophic failures are common on clients. But then there's the issue of trust - do you back your LN state up to a cloud, where it could be tampered with? To an exchange? You don't want to only have it on your phone, like ever. The moment funds change hands, that state should be written to their phone's internal storage, copied to their SD card, AND copied to a server somewhere so it can't be lost easily if the phone is dropped in a lake. The question is: Where? Perhaps that's up to each client. Google, Facebook, etc. already solved this, but the current trend is that they are proving to be untrustworthy. Your average software dev is just autistic enough not to think through real world conditions thoroughly.

Data loss (usually from hardware failure) is *exactly* the problem that will exist around LN until the state problem is addressed elegantly, but just like HD wallets manifested to solve this the first time around, it will be solved.

What kind of work? It's working how it is supposed to be. Users have to be careful about the state they broadcast on the network, it's by design.

It's like saying the Bitcoin protocol needs work since users are losing Bitcoins on a daily basis when they make mistakes handling their private keys.

Notice that you are in a Mexican Standoff. But he may not be aware you are if you don't tell him. He is definitely aware you are if you tell him.

 You have no way of broadcasting any transaction, he can just wait until you negotiate with him how much you are gonna pay for ransom, or until he gets tired of waiting and closes unilaterally.

Keep in mind that once you lost your history, if you request someone to close with you only one of 4 things can happen

1. He tells you what the ""stage"" is, and you both create a closing transaction signed by both from there (zero risk for him, risky for you, it doesn't have a justice clause)

2. He tells you what ""stage"" it is, and you keep transacting between each other (zero risk for him, risky for you, you just started signing from a stage that you are not sure if it was the last stage, but now it is too late, you already agreed that previous transaction was correct)

3. He tells you to broadcast the latest transaction yourself unilaterally (Or he hands you one that he would consider the latest one, zero risk for him, risky for you)

4. He waits until he needs to close the channel and closes it himself unilaterally. (Zero risk for him, and zero gain for him)

As you can see, only on (4) you can't lose anything. However, if you tell him that you don't know the latest stage, he can just lock your money forever, since you are afraid of broadcasting anything.

"> Also, is there a way to prevent my peers from lying about the current state to trick me to force close with outdated state?

Fundamentally, no, there is not. However, they risk having the channel force-closed under normal circumstances where you do know the current state and they still do lie, which isn't optimal for them. If they request the state from you rather than you requesting it from them, they have no idea if *you* are lying, which means that if they take the risk that you are telling the truth by publishing an old transaction, you or your watchtower could claim the penalty.

All that being said, once we get production-ready clients, there should be no reason for you to depend on the counter-party telling the truth, anyway, since you would be backing up every state change to a remote location. This isn't a problem since every step of the Lightning process has contingencies for if an update isn't acknowledged, so you just don't acknowledge an update until you have it backed up.

"Short answer:

> You DO NOT keep backups of lightning channels.


If you want to keep a backup, you are on the wrong. LN is not a cold wallet, it is as hot as it gets, you need to be connected...

You should only keep the latest state, and update it live. 
If you do the updating in the correct order, (increasing indexes before adding a new state, etc) if you lose the latest state, you are aware that you have lost the latest state, and you won't broadcast something in the incorrect order.

For an analogy, a hardware system with a PIN that checks the pin and then updates the number of checked pins can be broken into by unpowering at the right time.

"What the heck? That wouldn't work, it requires WAAAAAY too many resources. 

I get the sarcasm, but the entire point of LN is to have a layer that is instant and is a low energy network that doesn't require CPU power!

A cell phone app node could handle a few thousand hubs, and could act as a hub. THAT is the significance. It moves the security off of the network onto the blockchain, which is allowed to be slow. 

When 2 people close the channels they can agree on the channel state. Whenever there is a disagreement, both peers can submit a closing transaction. Because the order can be proven, whoever has the later transactions get all the funds in both sides, which takes 2 block confirmations. Sure, it takes 20 minutes, but this is only if one side tries to spoof or fake the transaction, or lie about the channel state (which just means submitting an older channel state). So the scammer knows that it won't work, AND that he loses all the money from both sides, so why would he even ever do that? That's what is keeping it secure. In this way, it gets the security of the blockchain, but the speed of centralization. It is centralized, controlled by the blockchain, which is controlled by decentralized network.

"Nope, this is what you are telling the other peer if you respond:

""Hey, I am over here, I forgot where the hell where we? Can you tell me in which state where we are at?""

At that point, he knows he can broadcast an old state with minimal probability of you being able to broadcast a justice transaction, and he can just broadcast the state of the channel that benefits him the most.

Of course, if you already trust each other to not attack each other... that is irrelevant.

## How to fix this?

In the future, someone could set up a server where they can monitor the network as a backup (this ""fix"" requires trust on that server... but you can modify this to require less trust)

- You can tell the server ""Hey, look for this transaction ID, and if you see this transaction on the network, you will know what to do with this specific signature""

- If that server is open about which transaction IDs he is monitoring, even if you lost your local state, you wouldn't broadcast an old state, since you would compare your transaction ID with the server.

- On top of that, you can feel safer telling your counterparty in the channel that you are lost, and if he could tell you where you guys are at. If he lies to you, you could check up with the service you are using, whether the justice transaction ID is already on the server or not.

"I think that the idea that launching a DDoS attack is expensive is ill-conceived, to take out a home server or a mobile node at least. And again, the amount of time you would need to do that for depends on the time lock negotiated when opening the channel. 
I think that the use case is not to have someone who dislikes you steal your fund. I am thinking of something like:
- advertise negative fees so that nodes open channels with you, or wait for normal channel creation
- wait for transactions to happen on that channel
- save a state of that channel which is favorable to you
- broadcast it on the blockchain
- at the same time, take out the node you had a channel with to prevent them from challenging your blockchain channel closure

"Can you help me clarify? When you say: 

> If the attack had succeeded, the attacker would have doubled his money

You make it sound like the hacker could potentially print money if the counter-claim smart contract was not broadcasted. This would violate the laws around how coins are produced and added to the blockchain.

I think what you mean to say, is that the user would get their 5 mBTC back on the blockchain, but the other node would still have a lightning-style IOU for the hacker on its side. Or something like that.

"They'll be the best at obtaining it, no doubt, but it's not debt based, and can't be printed, so the typical situation that happens now where congress passes a spending bill and borrows to give a cash infusion to their lobbyists will go away. That's the important part for me. I am sick of working hard for tainted, rigged, gamed money. I get that at first glance, if the supply of money is increased everyone's money becomes worth less, so it looks like an equal playing field, but there's a huge first mover advantage that is easily overlooked:

If I'm a drunkard and congress prints me a million bucks to go spend at an irish pub, so I start buying everyone drinks, soon everyone in the pub has tens of thousands and a beer costs a couple grand, but I am still the generous patron who bought everyone drinks in the first place. Nevermind that to cover my initially insurmountable debt, all I have to do now is sell a few hundred beers, assuming I ever intend on paying the debt.
