Can’t trust any of the exchanges unfortunately. I opened an account on Binance.com with google Authenticator and a few days later it was hacked and about $4500 was stolen. The hacker logged in from a new IP address from the UK and Binance still didn’t have them log in through my email as an added and obvious next step in securing my account. Binance.com added that feature 2 days later after about 100 emails were sent back and forth with their customer service. On bittrex the hackers would have never been able to hack my account because they have a new IP log in have to go through a link in your email after you try logging in the first time. Obviously Binance.com didn’t help me in anyway but I would suggest keeping most of your coins on a hardware wallet if possible.

Many people have suggested my hack on binance.com could have been an inside job. They have been one of the largest exchanges and 2 days after my account was hacked they decided to add the security feature of confirming your log in when a new foreign IP address is used. The IP address that did the hack was registered in a different country than mine too and customer support was worthless. ;2;0;False;RPohl203;dpo2w7r;Bittrex / Disabled Locking 120,000$ Inside.;7bvbsa;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7bvbsa/bittrex_disabled_locking_120000_inside/

"What do you mean nothing is for sale? The company is selling their shares/coins.

Here's a situation on the open market for you. An accredited investor sells a bunch of stock, even though that stock is going to go up 50% that year. He uses that money to invest in a project that's restricted to accredited investors, where he will make 100% that year. The people who buy his shares aren't accredited investors, so that investment isn't available to them, and the 50% is the best they can get. Nobody made a mistake.

There are plenty of situations similar to this. What about somebody who's selling for tax harvesting purposes? The tax benefits could make the trade profitable for them when waiting through the end of the year for an increase wouldn't be worth it, while the person who's buying could make money off that upswing. What about a day trader who buys and sells to profit off a quick swing, but the person he sold to was buying for the long term? And maybe the person he bought from needed to sell that day to get money for something but wasn't going to be able to access a computer later to sell, and couldn't risk setting a limit that the stock might not reach?

Edit: Regardless of any of these situations, a decision is made by taking into account the risk and reward. Say there's a 50% chance that a stock triples, and 50% chance it goes to 0. Investing in it would be a good decision because the outcome has a positive [expected value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value). If you invest and it goes to 0, you didn't make a bad decision, you just got unlucky. On average you would've made money. You made the best decision based on the risk/reward.

Also, like other people have said, multiple people could be buying from a single seller, so many people could be making the right decision and only one person making the wrong decision.";1;0;False;LegitosaurusRex;dpn9ukx;I bought yesterday.

"How would you know if BTC was, or is, ""overvalued?"" Some say it will go into the tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, and even millions of dollars. I believe it's overvalued if no one wants to pay the asking price any longer. I don't believe we're anywhere near that price, but that's just one man's opinion, and on BTC, I believe one man's 'guess' is just about as good as another mans. We're in uncharted waters here. Almost daily I watch the 'experts' explain why their previous 'guess' was wrong. They do it in an 'expert' manner, however. They don't really wanna admit that they're just guessing also.

"If the company doing the ICO doesn't sell any coins, then there isn't a price and their coins are worthless.

It's subjective. Speculative. Why do most people buy BTC? What kind of person do you think contributes to the total volume traded? The bottom line is that people are trying to turn a profit. Sure there's people buying into the philosophy of the blockchain or as the intended use as a curremcy. But the majority of people are here to make money. Crypto is for these  reasons highly speculative and their prices, highly volatile. So the value, I reason, is a construct of what people beleive it's worth. It's not like assessing the value of a stock, which has a solid business backing it with tangible goods. ;1;1;False;Insanity_-_Wolf;dpn8x4p;I bought yesterday.

"Forks create money. The fork isn't happening, so all the people who wanted to generate revenue are pulling out, and it makes bitcoin look like its run be a ship of fools.



IMO, all this comes from the loud ignroati who did not understand the economic impact of splits and instead spout of alarmist nonsense generally coupled with a surface level understand of how bitcoin math works, and fear of change.

"It's both but i would rephrase number one. Most of the people are late investors and think that current trend will continue. When people have seen bitcoin up 600% in 9 months they start to think ""oh this is going to continue"" and thats when they purchase. A big uptrend like that without any fundamental changes usually just means that it is pure speculation, which means that there will be a pullback.

It is not a crazy drop guys, stop talking like that. Bitcoin is at all time high of 9 days ago and has avoided one of the major risks. Yes there are attacks and people with obscure interests pumping the other currency. But just wait and see, they can't artificially pump it forever. Will happen just like in August.;1;1;False;alfonso1984;dpnw6or;I bought yesterday.

"Keep in mind though that not every Bitcoin address is segwit enabled yet. In my experience if you're sending / receiving to wallets using segwit BTC is actually very fast.

Also keep in mind that whilst the amounts in dollars were very close, that doesn't reflect the actual number of transactions, which is the important thing. I reckon there's a good chance they could be wildly different between the two currencies.";2;0;False;JoelTheSuperior;dpnc4hz;I bought yesterday.
