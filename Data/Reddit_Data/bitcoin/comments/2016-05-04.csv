"That is just it: There is nothing scientific about what they do

And the thing is, people DO decide what is reported on with respect to scientific articles in a manner that is actually pretty similar to how ""real"" journalism works. An article is written (generally by a third party, but I am extending this to include the more popular magazines where staff might make the articles) and submitted to the editors.

The editors then read the article (hopefully) and if they don't feel they are qualified to pass judgement, they seek additional reviewers/opinions. It is assessed with respect to bias, presentation, and validity.

That is why it is so hard to get somewhat radical/revolutionary work published. It takes a lot more thought to determine if it is valid or if you happened to be playing ball and some asbestos flaked into the beaker.

Same with real journalists and the like. Generally the editors are sufficient to figure out if something is worth publishing and, if not, phone calls and online chatrooms are used to discuss the ramifications of a publication. Generally the latter is more for ""So... this is fucked up. How do we report on this in a fair way?""

Wikileaks is none of that. Wikileaks is a 4chan message board that will give just as much credibility to grandma's fig pudding recipe as they do footage of a tragedy.

"Right, so it's your implication and conclusion that I disagree with.

The wages you're complaining about are actually higher than the wages that would prevail in an anarchic state.  Wages are set by supply and demand (often very low), then the state gets involved to raise them via things like minimum wage and collective bargaining protections.  

Most people throughout human history have lived harvest to harvest or paycheck to paycheck.  Fewer do under capitalism today than at any time in human history.  The ""anymore"" is nonsense.  People are more economically free today than at any point in human history.  Heck, you can even change countries fairly easily today (if you're lucky enough to live in a western developed country).  A worker in France can now move to Italy or Germany and work there quite easily.  Don't like your employer?  There are literally tens of thousands of other employers out there competing to hire talent.  Surely you can find one who will pay you what you're worth.

And there is no ""employers"" as a group.  Every employer is competing with every other employer for the talent that can contribute most to profits.  Everyone is free to ditch their employer and accept a better off at any time.  If someone can't find a better off anywhere else, it's because they're already being paid as much as their work is worth to *anyone.*  This last point is important - in a competitive market place, you're not paid what your work is worth on average, you're paid what your work is worth *to the person/company it's worth the absolute most to.*  So for example, an engineer with zero people skills and horrible body odor might be worth nothing in most companies, but there's probably some niche out there where he can add a lot of value and his lack of social graces will be tolerated and he'll earn a decent living.  The burden is on him to seek out that niche.

The reason wages for low-skilled jobs have been stagnant (or even falling) is simply technology.  It's insane to think that someone should be paid $25k+ a year to push a picture of a chicken on a McDonald's cash register, or to stack scarves on a rack at a clothing store or perform customer service purely off of a script.  .  Most of those jobs will be totally eliminated in the next 10 years because they can be done better & faster & cheaper by robots and algorithms.

"> Yes, most of them do make gains on top of inflation. Most of them in spite of, not because of inflation

I think in the current environment it is actually the other way around. Inflation, due to massive amounts of money printing and low interest rates,  almost entirely explains the rise in asset prices across the board, making the rich richer and leaving the rest of society falling behind. 

The reason no one talks about inflation is because the inflation is almost entirely seen in these rising speculative asset prices. This is because all the cheap money is going to the rich (banks, financial institutions, and corporations) who are then using this money to reinvest, often buying their own company's stock. Since people are used to stocks reflecting real underlying value in the economy, everyone assumes rising stock prices is good for the economy, and thus there is no talk about inflation. In fact, most inflation indices don't measure rising asset values. 

The fact that the rich are making a killing while the real economy remains stagnate should be a red flag for everyone, but the people who need to care don't because they are making such a killing.

"Read [this](http://www.quebecoislibre.org/001028-11.htm), it can explain this much better than I can. But regardless I will try. I would like to preface this by saying that this isn't the *only* way inflation benefits the rich/slants the economy. There is still the issue of it creating a largely debt-driven economy (and government debt of course).

So, the definition I am using of inflation is when freshly printed money reaches circulation and subsequently depreciates the total money supply. The issue is, this does not happen instantaneously. It takes time for the freshly printed notes to inflate the money supply (or more accurately, depreciate it). Some people/organizations have access to this money before it begins to depreciate the money supply, meaning that they can effectively ""cheat"" the system by gaining access to extra funds before they are devalued, or devalued to the full amount. This would directly apply to those that have access to freshly printed Federal Reserve notes first; I.E. the big banks, and many of those with government contracts. Typically, it goes to the rich first, and makes its way down the system to the main supply of money (I.E. circulation), so the same amount of money is worth more when the rich people use it; than when the rest of the country uses it. Read up on the Federal Reserve and how it functions.

I don't necessarily disagree with that but by the same token leverage and power is going to exist in an anarcho-socialist society as well.

That is not how inflation works. Inflation comes from the majority of society having money instead of the rich having money. The working class and poor have more money velocity than the rich, hence they drive up prices by spending. The rich lose from inflation because money sitting idle is never going to grow. Which is why they invest. There's no society that works without debt at the moment. Someone below mentioned anarcho capitalism, which is a good example, but hardly realistic in today's world. Maybe a century or two down the line. ;0;1;False;;d2s0c6l;"WikiLeaks on Twitter: ""We'd like to thank #Satoshi hoaxer Dr Craig Wright for showing how bankrupt the fact-checking standards are at the BBC, LRB & Economist.""";4hozs5;https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/727562945840975872

"More money doesn't depreciate the money supply. It either increases it temporarily or assuming perfect information does nothing to it even per your article.

"When middle income and poor people have more money they tend to buy more things, and the more things they buy, the more those things' prices go up. Basic supply and demand. This is the simple way of describing what you just described. 

But the same is true for rich people, when rich people have more money they tend to buy more things, and that drives the prices of the things they tend to buy up for the exact same reasons you just described with regard to poor and middle income people. 

The only difference is poor and middle income people tend to spend their money on food, clothing, and bills -- the things the inflation indices measure -- while rich people tend to buy stocks, bonds, real estates, luxury items, etc. 

It has nothing to do with money sitting idly when in the hands of rich people and being spent when in the hands of poor people. Not sure who came up with that somewhat confusing narrative. It has to do with what rich people spend their money on versus what poor and middle class people spend their money on. 

If the Fed had genuinely wanted to create what people like yourself call ""inflation"" it would have given the money to middle class people. They didn't want that kind of inflation, they wanted to prop up the stock market.

"1) Your differentiation of the spending habits of rich and poor people is completely intuitive. I didn't need to explain with that much depth for the same reason. 

2) however much the rich spend their money on purchasing normal products, the core cpi will *hardly* move if the wealth distribution skews towards the rich while it'll move a whole lot if the same distribution skews the other way. 

3) since money cannot be spent by the rich on normal products beyond a limit, they do have idle money lying around that could potentially devalue due to inflation which is why they invest. Ergo, my previous succinct point was correct. 

4) money directly sent to people will not help. It'll cause inflation but not growth. It's a long nuanced explanation I don't have the time for but I'll link later maybe.

"And that is not scientific, but it does illustrate my point

People are stupid. Giving them the raw data is irresponsible in many cases.

For example: ""Five hundred more people died from sounding last year than the year before"". That is raw data. That is also meaningless and everyone will interpret that as they wish.

A journalist's job is to figure out how to phrase that to get the point across. Maybe ""5x increase in sounding related deaths"" would be helpful and more meaningful. Except, even then, people are fucking stupid and might not understand that is still a REALLY low number.

The problem is that wikileaks insists on publishing that and then saying the equivalent of ""Sounding 100x more deadly than shark attacks. Are your children shoving stuff up their urethra? Read here before The Man attacks us!""

JUST publishing the raw data is sort of nice when it is a sorority initiation ritual (because that is important to know for some reason...) . When it contains personal information that can identify people and get them killed, not so much

"What you're saying doesn't make sense, it's in the article that Gavin Andresen verified the integrity of CW's claim.  As far as the world and Economist knew, Gavin was an impartial third party that had a very credible reputation and expertise in Bitcoin.  

From that perspective, it makes sense that they would think there is enough verification to go to print.  I certainly would think so.";3;0;False;masamunexs;d2sg509;"WikiLeaks on Twitter: ""We'd like to thank #Satoshi hoaxer Dr Craig Wright for showing how bankrupt the fact-checking standards are at the BBC, LRB & Economist.""";4hozs5;https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/727562945840975872
