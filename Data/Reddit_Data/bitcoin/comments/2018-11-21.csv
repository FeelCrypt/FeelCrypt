No, the volatility that we're seeing is a result of insufficient liquidity.

">>Bitcoin cannot be used as a currency without speculative investment first giving it some value.

>Except we have an 8 year track record of this happening already.

False, because as /u/cacheson correctly pointed out, that is impossible.

The Silk Road came *after* bitcoins had acquired a non-zero value (by, you guessed it: *speculators*!)... otherwise, no one would have been willing to exchange perfectly good drugs for BTC.

Furthermore, for many truly huge markets and uses, Bitcoin still needs to accumulate roughly one more order-of-magnitude of speculative value before being realistically viable.

Those who give Bitcoin value are, by definition, those who **demand** it: anyone who isn't holding coins over significant time-horizons is *not* helping the value of Bitcoin directly.

Other activities, like educating others, building and refining Bitcoin-based tools and services, and participating in economic exchanges using BTC definitely *do* help Bitcoin to grow and prosper *indirectly*, but those who save/hold/hoard coins are the ones who are *directly* giving it value.

"No. A bitcoin spent also has to be bought first. 

If there is a high level of commercial activity with Bitcoin, as originally intended, then buying by customers and selling by retailers will more or less even out. 

And if we get to that point, it would provide a large barrier against these huge price fluctuations we've seen from pure speculation markets. It's much harder to move the price up or down with the backdrop of billions of dollars of sustained commercial activity than it is with nothing but a bunch of fear and greed-driven speculators acting on herd mentality.

And besides that, the more businesses we get to accept cryptocurrencies and the more people actually use it to pay, the more businesses will be willing to retain at least some of their revenue in crypto and use it to pay some of their own expenses, thus closing the loop and providing even more price support.

All that will bring real utility to Bitcoin and utility has a value. That value will be reflected in the price. To people preaching ""Store of value first!"" I say Hogwash! What value? Based on what?

Furthermore, for many truly huge markets and uses, Bitcoin still needs to accumulate roughly one more order-of-magnitude of speculative value before being realistically viable. The biggest global economic players (including but not limited to national governments) might one day be acquiring and holding massive reserves of Bitcoin... or that's the dream, at least: Bitcoin being *the world's money*. But at the moment, it's still relatively small, volatile, illiquid, and manipulable (albeit significantly less so than it was in years past, obviously) and this works to stymie or slow growth and adoption on such scales.

What Bitcoin needs is for people to truly value it. Those who truly value Bitcoin will try to accumulate Bitcoin, obviously, boosting the all-important *demand* side of the supply/demand equation. They will *also* naturally encourage others to value it, too, even if it's simply through others' recognition of their own values (in other words, if I know my friend or neighbor loves Bitcoin, I'll know that I can always pay or give them Bitcoin in exchange for goods or services I need, and thus I will assign it a nonzero or even high value in my personal mental schema). But trying to spend your bitcoins (whether you're buying gift cards to use on Amazon or getting drugs from the Silk Road) isn't actually helping Bitcoin as much as *demanding it yourself* (which includes saving it) does.";1;0;False;thieflar;ea6qleq;Unpopular opinion: Those who use bitcoin to buy drugs online are doing more for bitcoin than the vast majority of HODL's;9z0k1v;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9z0k1v/unpopular_opinion_those_who_use_bitcoin_to_buy/

"**Gresham's law**

In economics, Gresham's law is a monetary principle stating that ""bad money drives out good"". For example, if there are two forms of commodity money in circulation, which are 

accepted by law as having similar face value, the more valuable commodity will gradually disappear from circulation.The law was named in 1860 by Henry Dunning Macleod, after Sir Thomas Gresham (1519–1579), who was an English financier during the Tudor dynasty. However, there are numerous predecessors. The law had been stated earlier by Nicolaus Copernicus; for this reason, it is occasionally known as the Gresham–Copernicus law.

"> you should not ever use drugs

Such an ignorant and narrow-minded statement. 

A lot of substances that society class as ""drugs"" are extremely beneficial to a lot of humans. You can grow tremendously as a person using psychedelics like LSD and Psilocybin, and that's not even getting into the clinical uses of these same substances to treat depression and anxiety, same with cannabis and MDMA to a certain degree. 

These substances can be abused of course, but they can also be used for tremendous personal growth, as well as treatment for a range of medical conditions. And these positive effects are not dependent on the drugs coming from your doctor either.

I think black and white statements like yours are incredibly narrow minded and shows you haven't been keeping up with modern research on ""drugs"". Luckily the younger generation seems to be pretty clued in when it comes to this subject, so it's just a matter of time before your outdated views go away.

"No I didn't miss that. That's why i included ""these positive effects are not dependent on the drugs coming from your doctor either.""

Of course, in a perfect world, all doctors would be up to date, knowledgeable and honest, and it would be no problem to leave it to the medical system. But the fact is that the entire medical system is severely lagging behind, and don't use these ""drugs"" to their full potential, or even at all.

"I'm holding BTC (and buy some every month) and also have some BCH in my wallet (way less than BTC) and some ETH too, but I can never really use either. Most of the time its way easier  and often even cheaper to just pay with paypal. For the darknet markets I use BTC -> XMR to stay anonymous

I'm very  dissapointed with the way Bitcoin is heading but it has the Bitcoin name so I hold mostly it (BTC) since I believe it will be worth more in the future simply because of first-to-market advantage

I personally believe BCH (ABCs) (SVs attempt at 64MB blocks was just laughably bad) on-chain scaling, combined with Graphene is alot better than LN (atleast currently) and according to stress tests it seems to work very well so far, on the other hand I really like SegWit and think BCH should have definitly forked with SegWit. Having 2 or 4MB blocks AND SegWit wouldn't impact 99% of nodes at all and would stop disasters like last December with 50$ TX Fees from happening. Enforcing 1MB blocks is stupid and unnecessary and it was never supposed to be kept at 1MB, the other extreme of having 64MB blocks or even bigger ones is equally stupid and unnecessary - atleast with current technology

Pretty much every definition of currency describes it as being circulated and being used for trade. A currency just sitting somewhere isn't being used for trade. This one of the reasons why gold, from your other thread, isn't a currency, but a commodity.

"You are right that currencies with other uses are bad, that's why we don't use bullets as currency for instance, because the manufacturing of it would need to be faster than the firing of it, or else it would disappear.

You are not correct, however, in your assessment that a currency that is hoarded is doing its job. By definition, if it doesn't circulate, and do so often enough, it's not a currency.

I'll give you an example: take something valuable, that always increases in value over time, like real estate. ¿Would real estate be viable as a currency? Nope.

Controlled inflation is actually 10x better for the economy that a fixed deflation rate. Coca-Cola cost exactly $0.05 a bottle for nearly 60 years in the US. In that time, those 5 cents came to be worth much less than before, but because the rest of the economy developed, and new categories of more complex, niche goods arose, basic products like bread, milk or Coca-Cola could keep their nominal cost.

I do agree though that current rates of inflation are unsustainable, but something like 0.75% of annual inflation on an economy with a size that of the US, for instance, and with added redenominations once every 100 years that could return the value of the currency to its previous state, would be quite viable.";1;1;False;;ea71tyv;Unpopular opinion: Those who use bitcoin to buy drugs online are doing more for bitcoin than the vast majority of HODL's;9z0k1v;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9z0k1v/unpopular_opinion_those_who_use_bitcoin_to_buy/

"It varies from person to person, and depends on what baggage they carry around, what events have shaped them and so on. Here is a quote from Dr. David Presti from UC Berkeley that can explain it better than me:

>""One of the ways psychedelics work is by reducing our psychological defenses. They allow the person to become aware of uncomfortable feelings and thoughts so they can come to the surface and be therapeutically processed. Nobody knows exactly how these things work, but there may be some kind of hard rewiring that goes on in the brain. They may increase neuroplasticity — make the neurons more susceptible to forming new connections.""

Humans have used ""drugs"" since forever, for many different reasons and benefits, and it's only very recently on the total timeline that it has become illegal and taboo. Have you really never heard of anyone experiencing personal growth after a one time use of psychedelics?

I understand that it's hard to wrap your head around, since society has indoctrinated everyone to think all drugs are bad, but spend a bit of time really researching what kind of personal growth one can experience and have on these substances.

">I mean even just a stats overlay gives you a huge edge. You input the parameters of the hand (# of players, type of poker, your hand, flop cards, etc) and it gives you the precise statistics of how likely certain cards are to pop up.

To be fair, that’s not a huge advantage over any semi-decent player. Calculating pot odds is pretty basic strategy, the math isn’t even that difficult.

The real advantage would be analyzing patterns in the play of your opponents in order to determine estimated hand strengths and fold probabilities. Combining that information with pot odds would give the bot a massive advantage over a player that doesn’t know what they’re up against.

Of course a *really* good human player who knew they were playing a bot could probably turn that advantage around and work it in their favor.

"You are misunderstanding what it means to use a currency.

Let me propose an alternate.  A person begins using a currency when he or she accepts it and continues using it while he or she holds it.  He stops using it when he buys something with it.

You need to see currencies as a sociological tool.  They are ledgers that a society uses as an accounting scheme. 

There are many many historical examples of competing ledgers fighting it out in the marketplace and it is clear and obvious what monetary properties the winning ledger will have.  This is how I can be completely certain bitcoin will overtake all other ledgers (usd, gold, et. al.) 

You mention gold as having non monetary value in addition to its monetary value (its value that comes from its use as a ledger).  This is actually a bad thing for gold.  All things being equal a currency that has solely monetary value will have superior use as a currency than a money that like gold has both a monetary and a non-monetary (utility) value.  

That is, I don't want a money that you can use as jewelry.  I don't want a money that people buy coffee with.

"> removes [Bitcoin] from the market

> make a large Bitcoin economy possible

Doesn't jibe. 

A large Bitcoin economy would be made possible by large-scale economic activity. By definition. Yes, that means buying, selling, paying for things. Bitcoin sitting dead in a wallet for years do not make an economy.

Unless hodlers keep buying endlessly, they do not drive up the value of BTC. They just remove liquidity and you end up with a much smaller market. Smaller markets are much easier to manipulate than large and liquid ones where the price is found as a balance of sustained high-volume commercial activity.

How has the hodling-to-create-value strategy been working out so far in 2018?

">does nothing for the coin or the community

No one owes the coin anything and you can do plenty for the community without spending your bitcoin (not saying you shouldn't spend it if you want to). But it's really ironic, because your assumption, that people forcing themselves to actively do something unnatural or counter intuitive with the coin is a good way to help with its maturation, is in fact the counter productive path. It's the same as websites forcing users to disable adblockers to use sites. They are trying to force an old model onto users who have outgrown that model. The least effective ads are ones that you force users to endure when they have indicated they don't want to.

Bitcoin must be useful of its own accord, for how people want to use it only, in a manner that fits in with their behaviour and needs. We mustn't force ourselves to use it in ways which are inefficient for us in a vain effort to force adoption. Why do you want to urgently force artificial usage anyway? Is it because you want the price to go up in the short-term? If not, then let it unfold naturally. Have a think about what you are actually pushing for -- it could be the case that you actually just want the price to go up as the ideal end.";1;0;False;complicit_bystander;ea6hlmv;Unpopular opinion: Those who use bitcoin to buy drugs online are doing more for bitcoin than the vast majority of HODL's;9z0k1v;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9z0k1v/unpopular_opinion_those_who_use_bitcoin_to_buy/

"Real-world use cases of Bitcoin I have either witnessed in person or used myself:

* Store of value
* Sending money overseas to avoid tremendous hassle with Banks (e.g. We're a BANK, we cannot do this and that!)
* *Receiving* money overseas to avoid tremendous hassle with payment processors (e.g. We're NOT a BANK, we cannot do this and that!)
* Purchasing legal goods and services online
* Purchasing illegal goods and services in the darknet (drugs)
* Distributing profit between shareholders to avoid contact with banks

So, you can be a legitimate hodler (e.g. «I have some coins for some reason») or a degenerate hodler (e.g. «I got in at 18k and I'm clenching my butt so hard I have to reinforce my beliefs constantly by telling everyone about that»).

"This is what an idiot Keynesian thinks makes money valuable. 

>treating bitcoin as an investment and leaving it in a wallet for years at a time does nothing for the coin or the community

Holding Bitcoin is what creates demand for Bitcoin and raises the price.  Only Keynesian fools think spending money makes it valuable. 

Consider that in a hyper inflation event, of which we have many historical examples, those currencies do not die because people stop spending them, they die because people stop being willing to buy (accept) and hold them.

Also consider that after the Silk Road went down, the frequency of Bitcoin transactions dropped but the price increased greatly, thus increasing liquidity and improving Bitcoin's utility.

You need to understand that it is the holders of a currency that make it valuable and spending is completely irrelevant.  Consider Gresham's and Thiers' laws about how good money and bad money interact in an economy.

We currently have good (hard, deflationary) money (bitcoin) and bad (soft, inflationary) money (US dollars).  Why the hell would anyone spend Bitcoin when people will accept US dollars instead?

You should expect the bad money to drive the good money out of circulation the same way bad coins (1965-present) drove the silver money out of circulation in the US.    It is only when no one will accept bad money any longer that people would rationally want to spend their bitcoins.

"I heavily disagree:

When you have a large group of HODLers who transact only now and then, but when they transact they don't mind to pay a high fee (relative to a spender) you have the most valuable transactions on the main chain (with limited capacity) and thus the most optimal security. Spenders can transact anonymous, fast and cheaply on LN and other additional layers that benefit of the huge security that HODLers bring to the base layer.

People buying illegal goods is not good for Bitcoin at all (I personally don't care, someone should be able to buy whatever he wants as long as it is only bad for himself), because it is a huge source of FUD.

Several years ago, 1 paycheck would buy me 1BTC, and still leave me with Fiat to spare for my monthly expenses. Now, if I want to buy 1BTC, I have two options, I can either save for a month and maybe buy .5BTC, or buy as much mBTC as I can afford each week for a few months until I have 1BTC or more.

"I understand your point and agree with it mostly, but I have some issues with spending Bitcoin in general. Let me explain. What I usually do is spend and replace. Whatever Bitcoin I spend is immediately replaced by exchanging fiat for new Bitcoin. That way, I get to hold and spend Bitcoin simultaneously without suffering too much from price spikes or drops. My problem however is where to spend Bitcoin. Most online shops that accept Bitcoin are doing so through a third party payment gateway, which is more likely than not going to liquidate the Bitcoin for fiat the moment the transaction is confirmed. That is in my opinion not good for Bitcoin right now, as it only generates more selling pressure for Bitcoin.

"That's a fair point.

Seen from an economic point of view, the concept of HODLing to support BTC doesn't make much sense.

In order to make Bitcoin an efficient currency (in the very broad sense of this word), you need two factors :

* Liquidity : easy and quick conversion from and to other currencies (once again in the broad sense of this word)
* Small volatility : stable conversion rates from and to other currencies

Keeping big chunks of BTC from circulating doesn't help --and in fact handicaps-- BTC on both of these points.

What helps these two points, is having A LOT of transactions, small and big. For BTC to succeed, it has to ""move"" from one hand to one other, as often as possible. And the best example of this happening in the BTC domain is definitely on the darknet drug marketplaces. A lot of small to average to big transactions...too bad it's on something illegal (but from an economic point of view, it doesn't matter).

People HODL to show how much they trucs BTC to succeed as a currency. Which is awesome from a human point of view...but from an economic point of view, it's completely counter-productive.

"I really can’t think of another market besides drugs and gambling where bitcoin is used heavily like a currency. And I think that’s only because they have to.

In regards to the hodler, he can’t be rich 50 yrs from now if they spend their coins, but he still can’t get rich if NO ONE spends coins because then it won’t survive 50 years. So he has to encourage others (mainly newbies) to spend SO he can be rich while not spending himself. Which makes the bitcoin community come of as predatory.

I’m still new to bitcoin and I’m starting to think fell for the okie doke. If bitcoin becomes the currency of the future, anything I spend now only helps the 1% of the future.

I agree with you. Everyone should do their part and basically buy and replenish, buy and replenish. If done in a smart way it's not even expensive to do and it helps a lot the adoption of the currency. Like for instance if the problem is the difficulty, or the cost, in getting fiat into one's preferred exchange then make the effort to load the exchange with, say, thousands of dollars of fiat, then exchange little by little, use little by little, after the fiat stack is finished do the process of wiring fiat on the exchange again. If done properly and using the right exchangers it's not even too risky (anyway not riskier than keep the money on, say, a grade b bank) ;1;1;False;roveridcoffee;ea5rhuu;Unpopular opinion: Those who use bitcoin to buy drugs online are doing more for bitcoin than the vast majority of HODL's;9z0k1v;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9z0k1v/unpopular_opinion_those_who_use_bitcoin_to_buy/

"Your opinion is unpopular because it's wrong. Bitcoin cannot be used as a currency without speculative investment first giving it some value.

If everyone is just playing hot-potato with it and trying to get rid of it as soon as possible, you won't have any liquidity to sustain trade. Merchants won't just have to worry about the price dropping before they're able to sell their coins; they'll have to worry about getting stuck with coins that they can't sell for *any* price for extended periods of time. Your darknet markets would have to go back to using cash in the mail for payments. For an indication of how well that worked, consider that you didn't know what a darknet market was before Bitcoin existed.

Investors (both short and long term) provide liquidity to Bitcoin, meaning that it can be easily converted to cash. The more investment, the more liquidity, the easier it is to convert, and the less the price slips when you buy or sell. As liquidity increases, new use-cases for Bitcoin get unlocked, since larger and larger transactions can be undertaken without sending the price whipsawing up and down.

"Bitcoin as a store of value is a perfectly acceptable use case and probably its most important use case. Scarcity and incentives were cleverly built into it because of that.

Gold, as mentioned in other comments is the perfect example of that. 
We don’t pay stuff in gold and it is of great value. 

Yes, gold has other uses, it’s a good conductor and it’s shiny and all but that does not by any means reflect the valuation given to gold. Most of its valuation is given by its scarcity and its efficacy as a medium-of-exchange, just like Bitcoin! In fact, worse than Bitcoin.

Just by searching gold intrinsic value on google you will find countless articles about it. 

Some examples:
[This one](https://www.sbcgold.com/blog/the-intrinsic-value-of-gold-and-silver/):

> To be sure, gold is shiny and has long been used in the crafting of jewelry and ornamentation. It has always been desired for these purposes. However, few wars have been fought over pearls, which also make lovely jewelry. No, it is neither the glimmering earrings nor necklaces that comprise the majority of gold’s intrinsic value. It is something else.
> Their value comes from nothing less than their efficacy as a medium of exchange – as a form of money. It may sound weird at first, or perhaps tautological, to claim that gold is valuable because it can be used as value, but this is precisely the point. Precious metals, through their very nature, are simply commodities that are best suited to be used as money. A brief examination readily testifies the point.

Or [this one](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/071114/why-gold-has-always-had-value.asp)

> Other than looking pretty, and acting as a former currency, gold is seemingly uninteresting, with no intrinsic value other than the value humans have attached it. So if not out of necessity, why has gold always had value? The reason lies in our psychology as well as gold's rather boring qualities.
> From a elemental perspective, gold is the most logical choice for a medium of exchange for goods and services. It is abundant enough to create coins, but rare enough that not everyone can make them. It doesn't corrode, providing a sustainable store of value, and humans are physically attracted to its color and feel.

It feels like your opinion is unpopular because it doesn’t look like it’s based on facts.

I concede that it would be good that we all could one day use Bitcoin to buy everything.
I also concede that more adoption would increase Bitcoin value! That’s why LN is great!

But hodling is perfectly fine, it makes Bitcoin even more rare and it solidifies its use as a store of value.

I think there's definitely something to be said for using bitcoin rather than just holding it as a store of value. It's one of my biggest issues with exchanges/coinbase - you buy the cold then you hold the coin and can't really do anything. Full disclosure, I'm connected with ParJar so I see that people actually like using Bitcoin with eachother - even if its a few pennies/dollars at a time. Until we have something to do with BTC instead of waiting for it to go up or down I just don't think most people are going to see a reason to have any. ;1;0;False;lindseyscottw;ea6z38k;Unpopular opinion: Those who use bitcoin to buy drugs online are doing more for bitcoin than the vast majority of HODL's;9z0k1v;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9z0k1v/unpopular_opinion_those_who_use_bitcoin_to_buy/

"The price floor would come from a balance of large-scale buying and selling due to sustained commercial activity. Not necessarily with drugs, but anything that can be bought and sold. A high volume market like that would automatically find an equilibrium that's much harder to move up or down.

You can argue the same about traditional currency. If you are making money in the stock market just to put more money in the stock market, as many corporations now operate, is that money really doing anything?

How is that? If you hold and do nothing else, you have no impact on price at all. If you hold 90% of bitcoin in a wallet in your safe, the other 10% are all that matter for pricing. If I hold a bunch of that 10% and want to sell, then even if you think each bitcoin of yours is worth $1000, I'm still only getting what the buyer will pay (let's say $500). If I'm trying to sell and the only people willing to buy offer $1 and I sell, that's now the last price of bitcoin.;3;0;False;Rheticule;ea6cyvy;Unpopular opinion: Those who use bitcoin to buy drugs online are doing more for bitcoin than the vast majority of HODL's;9z0k1v;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9z0k1v/unpopular_opinion_those_who_use_bitcoin_to_buy/
" It’s not a currency. Don’t get confused. 

A currency is controlled by the central bank of a country. 

Bitcoin is largely controlled by 1) miners in China and Russia who effectively set the rates and 2) early adopting whales with a huge proportion of the wealth. 

It’s not decentralised, most people don’t use it for transactions, and most of the wealth is concentrated on the hands of the few, not the many.

I think y'all need to stop focusing so hard on *trying* to make Bitcoin money. Precious metals didn't come about through a detailed plan by a bunch of merchants and consumers trying to petition and lobby everyone to adopt them as money. It just came about naturally through the spontaneous order of the market. No one had to tell anyone what to do, it simply happened that way because it was meant to be that way, in the long term. If Bitcoin (or any other crypto for that matter) really is the best solution to money, then it will eventually come about regardless of how individuals decide to use it. The only thing you should worry about is keeping government's grubby hands off of it (since government that is *not* a natural market process).;0;0;False;ParkerLewisCantLube;ea677dh;Unpopular opinion: Those who use bitcoin to buy drugs online are doing more for bitcoin than the vast majority of HODL's;9z0k1v;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9z0k1v/unpopular_opinion_those_who_use_bitcoin_to_buy/
I only partially agree. The value of a currency does not require it actually be used. I think the black markets are extremely useful because they force cryptos to adapt and optimize in real use scenarios. It also generates more users of crypto who wouldn't otherwise. I don't think that holding crypto currency devalues it like you're saying however. People holding it is just as trustworthy an indicator of value as people spending it for goods and services. While short term demand may be affected more by use than accumulation I'm very confident in the long term it balances out.

But you don’t go to the store and buy coffee with gold or bitcoin. In terms of peer to peer monetary transactions I think PayPal leads the way. PayPal is the safest way and consumer friendly way to purchase things online. You can even get low I interest loans from PayPal. I think a digital usCurrency backed by the fed would be awesome.

If you use bitcoin , now you are taxed as a commodity    You can avoid these taxes, illegally, while keeping the money in bit coin.   Once you convert it to USD, questions will be asked.

"As expected, you are a bacasher. You don't know what you're talking about, are taking dumb videos to ""explain stuff"" as reference, and keep missing the point that there just is (essentially) no demand for cryptos today, which means there's plenty of time to develop the technology.

[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9x3wyl/what_do_you_think_of_this_criticism_of_lightnings/e9phw3g/) you can read about statements like ""routing is an unsolved problem"". 

The TL;DR is that people who have never had to solve a real, practical problem in their lives will always criticize everything that is being built around them. If you did, you'd know that you *NEVER* solve a problem 100% for everything. Instead, you make various compromises which still give you a ""good enough"" outcome.

On chain payments... in case you missed it, Liquid is now live. That's an example of a sidechain which will take a lot of traffic off the main chain. Other side chains will emerge, all of which will relieve the main chain. LN itself provides tremendous relief. You are also missing that people are happily locking money into the LN, and plug and play LN nodes already exist, Google for the Casa LN node. more will come, and more and more funds will get locked into the LN. Which is being improved (at the protocol level) right now. And Schnorr + sig aggregation is cooking. Then channel factories. All of this will provide *huge* relief to the main chain. Once all of that is exhausted, and there's so much room to go it's untrue. After all of this is done, blocks can be increased. End result, fees will be high to sustain mining, but affordable, especially because as a private user you'll mainly use the LN only.

But why am I bothering explaining all this? Religious zealots are irrational by definition. Add an unhealthy dose of conspiracy, and you'll find banksters/AXA/Rotschild/Bilderberg.... that have taken control of Bitcoin and are working hard to break it. OK.

"No, they are not. You cannot eliminate counter-party risk, even with a smart contract. Counter party risk is the risk that I lend you money, and you don't repay me. ""But the smart contract will ensure repayment, you say."" 

&#x200B;

Ok, so then either the smart-contract itself has to have sufficient money to repay the loan, or the smart contract has to be authorized to initiate a payment from your wallet to mine. 

&#x200B;

In the former case (smart-wallet contains the money for the loan), you cannot access the money from the smart contract, because otherwise my guarantee of being repaid is lost. (You could spend the money which the smart contract transferred to you, and then at a later date not have sufficient funds to repay the smart contract).

&#x200B;

In the latter case in which your wallet must be guaranteed to have sufficient funds in it to repay me, you would have no need for a loan (since you already have the funds!).

&#x200B;

Conclusion: I cannot be guaranteed repayment of my loan to you, unless the smart-contract doesn't allow you access to the money, OR you place an equivalent sum of money in escrow (in which case you don't need a loan!).

"I am getting real tired of these idiotic amateur economists proclaiming what a ""real currency needs"".  You people are like those clowns in Idiocracy that water plants with Brawndo because it has electrolytes.

Bitcoin not only has all the properties a currency needs to succeed, but it has *the best possible monetary properties a money could have.*

If you think a currency needs to be ""stable"" in a market that very much dynamic and very stable, you are setting yourself up for a massive failure because the price you pay to avoid market-adjusted pricing is that your currency becomes very fragile and prone to black swan events. 

One of these days your man behind the curtain is going to pull the wrong lever and you're going to get promptly fucked in the ass by a big black swan.  And when this happens, I'm sure you will loudly blame bitcoin, but really you will only have yourself to blame.

I see the potential in bitcoin but I also see why myself and friends don’t spend bitcoin. Our main reason is that it’s better to buy items with FIAT since the price is stable than with Bitcoin which still has a relatively volatile price. For instance something that costs £10 would be £10 in BTC one day but the next it could be the equivalent of £11.50 just because of the market crashing. This can add up and end up costing more for myself and other people just for adopting Bitcoin.

"The tone on this sub changed drastically when head mods started to remove pro-hard fork opinions as ""not being about Bitcoin"". Before that, believe it or not, this sub was overwhelmingly in support of the hard fork that would later become Bitcoin Cash, and made fun of Lightning supports the way we now make fun of BCH supporters.

Along with the change towards hating BCH, came a focus on Bitcoin as a storage of value, not a currency. Because that's really what the decision to not hard-fork was based on: People wanted BTC to be a storage of value, and were okay with transfers costing more and taking longer if it meant the price went up. 

Now, we've since largely recovered from the worst of long/expensive transactions, but the sentiment still sticks that using Bitcoin as a currency isn't that important anymore. Discussion is almost 100% about the price, and honestly you don't see the same kind of shitposts and memes about ""Are you saying I can sell this for a million dollars? - No, I'm saying that when you're ready, you won't have to"".";4;0;False;Bioman312;ea55i3i;What happened the emphasis of spending bitcoin on this sub?;9ys0y5;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9ys0y5/what_happened_the_emphasis_of_spending_bitcoin_on/
"Spending bitcoin is an edge case. Due to the deflationary nature of Bitcoin it doesn't promote spending. 

If you believe it will replace or company fiat why spend it? If you're in to make money why spend it?

So who and why would spend Bitcoin?

a) early adopters that have a shitton but not enough fiat. I personally know few people with thousands of bitcoins but they don't cash out.

">This sub used to get excited about more people USING bitcoin, now everyone's only concern is how much money they might lose. I think this sub has lost sight of what Bitcoin really is: a currency.

Bitcoin is in that kind of state right now. Bitcoin has many properties.. Right now its valuation is a top talking topic as it's fluctuating heavily after a massive bull run. It's only natural, and valuation is very important aspect of Bitcoin. And not everyone is talking about how much money they might lose. Worst case is only -100%...

Bitcoin being deflationary, it works as a ""savings account"" and is used as such by many. Bitcoin was never about ""spend spend spend"" like fiat systems are. That's a crucial difference: inflationary fiat systems encourage to spend while deflationary Bitcoin encourages saving. Saving is much more healthy than mindless spending just for the sake of it, anyway. It would be unfair to say that spending is or should be the primary use for Bitcoin. Historical usage of Bitcoin, even when it was inconvenient, made the word spread. These days that (spreading the word) is not needed in the same way.

Bitcoin is best spent when it's (or has a chance to get to be) the most convenient way to send money to whoever you're sending money to. Bitcoin has various properties that makes it excel in some use cases while not excelling in some others. E.g. accepting money via Bitcoin is the most risk-free method (at least for me).";2;0;False;Anduckk;ea57rdu;What happened the emphasis of spending bitcoin on this sub?;9ys0y5;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9ys0y5/what_happened_the_emphasis_of_spending_bitcoin_on/

"Because if the recpieants of the satoshis doesn't intend to hold them, all you're doing is using the bitcoin network as a very clumsy, expensive and slow payment rail for fiat.

First people have to want to sell for BTC, then you can pay them in BTC. And not necessarily using the bitcoin network directly. More likley it's going to be LN, Visa'esque and Paypal-like payments processors etc.

What really going into bitcoin forces you to do, is get your terminology right.

You say bitcoin really is a currency.

There's a difference between:

* Money
* Unit of account
* Medium of exchange
* Method of payment
* Currency

Bitcoin is a money that comes with an integrated method of payment. This has nothing to do with it being a currency or not.

Issuing paper notes on bitcoin deposits would leave bitcoin being a money and make the paper notes currency.

LN is a method of payment for the money bitcoin, but not a currency.

Bitcoin is a medium of exchange, because people use it to exchange it for other stuff in the future.

Bitcoin is not yet a unit of account, although one could argue it is somewhat in the altcoin trading scene, where you measure your gain relative to BTC.

In my opinion, the one thing bitcoin isn't, is a currency. That's why I hate the term ""crypto currency"". The source of this confusion is probably because we are all used to the money simultaneously also being the currency. There's no difference between the *money* USD and the *currency* USD. There *was* a difference, when the USD notes were the *currency* to the *money* gold.

Moreover:

https://btc-help.lima-city.de/spendinghodling/index.html

**Spending vs. Hodling**

**Gresham's law**

> Gresham's law states that any circulating currency consisting of both ""good"" (Bitcoin) and ""bad"" (fiat, like USD, EUR,...) money [...] quickly becomes dominated by the ""bad"" (fiat) money. This is because people spending money will hand over the ""bad"" coins rather than the ""good"" (Bitcoin) ones, keeping the ""good"" ones for themselves. Legal tender laws act as a form of price control. In such a case, the artificially overvalued money is preferred in exchange, because people prefer to save rather than exchange the artificially demoted one. 



In short: Why would I spend the money, that's expected to rise in value, i.e. Bitcoin? I'd rather spend the money, which is expected to fall in value, i.e. fiat.

**""The Yield from Money Held"" Reconsidered**

> If a person then adds to his cash balance (i.e. buys and hodls bitcoin), he does so because he is confronted with a situation of (subjectively perceived) increased uncertainty regarding his future (like future devaluation of fiat, capital controls, confiscation, etc.). The addition to his cash balance represents an investment in presently felt certainty vis-à-vis a future perceived as less certain. In order to add to his cash balance, a person must restrict his purchases or increase his sales of nonmoney goods (producer or consumer goods). 


In short: Because individual financial sovereignty is the number one usecase for Bitcoin, naturally, holding it is the most desired action for most people. Yes, holding Bitcoin is using Bitcoin. Bitcoin is not here to be a better PayPal or Visa, which it never can be due to physical (like the laws of physics) restrictions on how well a blockchain scales compared to a centralized system. It's here to replace the Dollar, Euro, Gold.

**Spend and replace** 

Furthermore, merely spending Bitcoin would of course weaken its price. The more supply there is on the market, the lower the price will go. It doesn't matter which thing is on the other side of the trade, if it's a USD note, or a donkey, or an apple.

Spending bitcoin is probably a good way to circulate bitcoin towards people who, for various reasons, don't buy bitcoin directly, using an exchange, or Bitcoin ATM. But you should always replace what you spent, ideally in the same moment and ideally a little more than you spent. For example, if you just spent 0.015 BTC, rebuy 0.018 BTC instantly.";1;0;False;Renben9;ea5eede;What happened the emphasis of spending bitcoin on this sub?;9ys0y5;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9ys0y5/what_happened_the_emphasis_of_spending_bitcoin_on/

Yup, still doesn't make sense to buy stuff with a volatile asset though. It's a bit like a community demanding that everyone use digital penny stocks as currency when the reality is that they are awful as a currency (but great to trade). Decentralized, transferable, divisible doesn't mean jack unfortunately when the price moves so much. 

It's why there are now so many stable-coins entering the fray. BTC doesn't have a hope against them (as a currency)

"I am over 50 with savings and business interests. The service banks afford to me are unrivalled.

In fact,  your comment is the exact opposite of the real world. It's easy to want to ""be your own bank"" when you are a teenager living with mom & pop and you have $500 to your name and think you are on some crusade against the big evil corporations. Hence the current BTC community being largely under the age of 25.

Try being your own bank when you actual wealth to store and money coming in/out from various businesses.

If you want security you pay a bank to look after your money; it's protected from robbery, fraud, hacking, bankruptcy and it's super convenient in the western world where most business is done and where most people travel.

BTC will *never* afford the same level of security which is why it will never compete. Keeping BTC on your own hardware wallet is the modern equivalent to stuffing notes in a suitcase under your bed. Sure it hides your money from governments but 99.9% of the western world doesn't have a need to do that and they also want their money to be stored more securely.  


The same thing with BTC - it certainly provides a benefit to some, but it's still the same people who previously stored money under their bed, so 0.01% - hence why it hasn't and won't go mainstream.

Our economy is almost non-existent
Our healthcare is well good luck

"> Satoshi invented Bitcoin after the Great Recession to give people means to financially protect themselves and be their own bank

Well if that's the case then Satoshi dun fucked up.  Bitcoin is withering on the vine for several major and nearly-impossible-to-correct reasons: 

1 - Design of the protocol and bitcoin blockchain was badly flawed in multiple fundamental ways.  Poor scalability lead to performance problems and (unsurprisingly, given human nature in general) too much incentive to fork.  ""Mining"" started out as an act of communal stewardship over network integrity, but has turned into a total clusterfuck that's been captured by huge Ponzi players of questionable commitment to anything but their own short term profits.  A rigidly-enforced (at the protocol level) community of **small** miners eking out a tidy (but not obscene) profit whilst contributing to network security would have prevented this from happening. It probably would have prevented the bubble all on its own by preventing hype in general from swirling uselessly around bitcoin because nobody would be making crazy profits (allowing bitcoin's actual utility to be its selling point, not the insane appreciation/volatility...)    

2 - Bitcoin suffered terribly from the community's easy acceptance of the waves of cash that washed over the community, ignorantly and selfishly chasing the ""next thing"".  This money has done nothing of lasting value for either bitcoin itself or the community (although one could argue it has helped to advance blockchain tech a lot) except to make a handful of people wealthy and impoverish at least as many.  Bubbles suck, and this one was caused by selfishness and greed.  For all the lofty philosophical talk, this community sold its soul for a song.  

3 - The community also made the crucial and irrevocable mistake of giving a flying fuck what the ""price"" of a bitcoin was in U.S. dollars.  Once that line was crossed, there was no going back... bitcoin was compromised.  You don't ""be your own bank"" or imagine you're dealing with an alternative to fiat when you price your so-called alternative in fiat and crow about how much your so-called alternative has ""appreciated"".  If you care what the dollar price is of anything, it's an ""alternative"" to *nothing*.  

4- Lastly, as OP points out, this community turned its back on making bitcoin a viable medium of transaction, which would have been essential to its being more widely accepted.  You hoarded. You speculated.  You blew your first, best chance to change things.  

You fucked up.  Stick a fork in this thing -- bitcoin has been dead for a while to anyone who understands what it was, could have been, and how the chances of that happening now are slim and none, and Slim has left the building...

">If you were convinced it could go no higher, would you begin to spend it? Even then, I have my doubts you would.

Spend it? Yes, if there was an expense where bitcoin made sense I'd be happy to spend it today. Thriftily because, guess what, it's money and I want to save it. But spending Bitcoin is no different then spending fiat once you take the mental leap that it's *better money*, I'm less that value either way.
