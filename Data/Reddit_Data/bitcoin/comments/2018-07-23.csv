 Nope, that's not truth :D I'm smart enough to avoid banging that drum even once :D At least, I transferred my crypto into the wallet right after buying it. Keep calm and hodl! ;1;1;False;Newseller;e2vk6gc;Difference between New and Experienced Trader;8yjav9;https://i.redd.it/75vkmfynep911.jpg
So, as I understood, you’re kinda smart guy here. I such case it would probably be an easy thing for you to recommend newbie (aka me) some reliable cryptocurrency exchange :) By the way, have you heard anything about cex? Or about any other exchange, which you’ve used, any advice would be highly appreciated.  ;1;1;False;esmith70858;e2vydos;Difference between New and Experienced Trader;8yjav9;https://i.redd.it/75vkmfynep911.jpg

Yea, let's pretend that China doesn't have the 2nd most billionaires on the planet. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_the_number_of_billionaires

"Yeah really. No one. I could damn near bet no one, not even people with wealth in those countries stored their wealth their.

Hell countries don't store their wealth in their own countries. They store it in American banks. You know why? Because they know American banks are tight as shit. Some European banks too for that matter.  

edit: Implying that the dollar is strong as shit. Why? Because, even today, our country is strong as shit on our economy.
