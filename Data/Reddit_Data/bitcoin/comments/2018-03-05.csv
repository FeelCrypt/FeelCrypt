"Heyy, Monero hardfork is on block 1529810. I thought I read that the hardfork will happen on March 14th. Then it's time for the screenshot to get the 1:10 MoneroV. When that block is over I will sell it as soon as possible.

Other altcoins are currently dangerous investments. It is not really recommended. Tradening is possible but then you have to sit with your nose all day long.
You then have to keep the live price chart of btc-usd constand open on a screen. and the graph of an altcoin that you want to trade.
Wand the cheaper a coin, the greater the chance of even greater losses.

I think Monero is a pretty save investment right now. Because of the airdrop of moneroV and because this coin is in a higher price category. you do not have to deal with huge price fluctuations.

But I can not give any guarantees if it also continues to rise up to the fork. wall bitcoins will determine it.";1;1;False;oapieNL;dv6z0iq;When you are trying to buy the dip;81qkxp;https://v.redd.it/14187bzhakj01

"Interesting point. I assumed since I can't afford much I would stick to the cheaper ones, but the low volume makes sense.

Though what about the fees? It's not proportional eg. cheaper = less

"I'm doing programmatic trades. I did it already with block.io/shapeshift but I'm looking for a wallet that offers more options than btc/ltc/dogecoin.

Though I could just use those main coins and trade those. I have to actually work on the analytics part that makes the decision to trade. Don't worry I'm dealing with the tiny ones eg. Dogecoin. Hence why I was looking for a different wallet that provided other alts like Voxels, Reddcoin, Potcoin, etc... (currencies under $1 each preferably $0.001 or so)

It's dumb, distraction, I'm not a math/trade guy so... it will more than likely lead to loss. But I'll hook it up to Twillio (probably not use Slack it's free) and get the notifications like ```trading_bot_002 made a trade of 200 reddcoin```

Problem right now is sending into Coinomi addresses I can't get it back (with code). Coinomi has multiple wallets for at least 6+ of the <$1 altcoins";1;1;False;crespo_modesto;dv83h35;When you are trying to buy the dip;81qkxp;https://v.redd.it/14187bzhakj01
