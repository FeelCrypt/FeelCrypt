There are things that happen on the dark web that would make your skin crawl.  Never mind the fact that drug dealers buy pounds of whatever they want, including cocaine, using bitcoin.   There are things called “red rooms” which I don’t care to elaborate using text, there is also human trafficking, pedophilia and any number of more things.  Most all of this is funded by crypto currency.  I don’t advise watching videos about what actually goes on in the dark web, but there are videos explaining these things if you are interested in learning.  ;-1;1;False;Backbone89;e2ecjkx;Truth;8ytxrf;https://i.redd.it/sr4xehlzjx911.jpg

Yeah I hear ya.  I just don’t see it possible that people are using money online anonymously.   Am I wrong?  Like, there is always a digital trail, one that is exponentially more easy to for the people trying to stop the terrible things to see.;1;1;False;Backbone89;e2fh0fr;Truth;8ytxrf;https://i.redd.it/sr4xehlzjx911.jpg
You can’t use money online anonymously, and when you use it in real life it’s most likely not anonymously because you have to interact with real people to make the exchange.  Crypto’s entire purpose is for the exchange of goods with complete anonymity online, which allows for dark web activities to thrive.;1;1;False;Backbone89;e2eyhid;Truth;8ytxrf;https://i.redd.it/sr4xehlzjx911.jpg
"Cash is anonymous with except to the two parties, which in most cases are not interessted to make it public. Sure, there is the risk of cops making a trap, but this applies to dnm as well. Or the situation, when two guys come to your home and want the money for the kilo coke you bought and used without paying.. well these things happen, no matter what exchange medium was used.

And I don't agree, the value of crypto comes from the amount of usage. Right now it's pure speculation. Also, the fiat value doesn't mean something to dark net trades. Prices will adjust.

Don't get me wrong. I see your point, as crypto allows a far bigger market then traditional black market, espescially for digital goods like illegal videos or chemicals from the other end of the world, but using crypto for legal things or trading/investment doesn't mean, you're supporting all the things you listed above.

I could be wrong, but I believe the difference is that crypto currency makes it nearly impossible to trace who is actually spending the money.
