"Then you should really consider that Bitcoin-the-token is tied intimately to Bitcoin-the-blockchain.  You cannot really ""transfer"" Bitcoin-the-token except via some contract built on top of Bitcoin-the-blockchain.  There is no other blockchain that can safely transfer Bitcoin-the-token (well sidechains promise to do so, but they're actually pretty far away and may never fully materialize, ***and*** they are built as very complicated contracts on top of Bitcoin-the-blockchain anyway).

Thus also a good part of Bitcoin-the-token's value is the value of the Bitcoin-the-blockchain it is on.  And in general, a lot of the experimentation on alternative blockchains isn't really very valuable or usable.  And even if *some* alternate blockchain experiment succeeds (which is not likely) the fact that Bitcoin is open-source free-as-in-speech software means it can adopt any new innovations, at the minimum as an extension block (we already know how to make those, since SegWit is effectively an extension block).

So basically, Bitcoin-the-blockchain isn't the Internet --- it's TCP/IP.  It's a single standard used by everyone because it's much more convenient to be intercompatible than not to be intercompatible, and it's flexible enough that innovations can be bolted onto it and on top of it (HTTP, FTP, etc).  And the Internet exists because everyone uses TCP/IP; you'd have to go through various little bits of hell if you weren't using TCP/IP and trying to connect to the Internet.  Bitcoin-the-blockchain is TCP/IP.  And the only token it supports is Bitcoin-the-token.";2;0;False;almkglor;e3xt3kg;Bitcoin has stabilized?;95upw4;https://i.redd.it/0hfg960i61f11.jpg
"almkglor's response is spot on. To add to what they already mentioned, the Bitcoin network also has an enormous amount of hash power behind it. I don't think any alt coins will ever come close to catching up with it. For example the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap is Ethereum whose hash rate is a bit under 300 TH/s. Bitcoin's hash rate is a little over 50,000,000 TH/s. Completely blows the closest competition's hashing power out of the water by many orders of magnitude. The reason why this is so important is that the higher the hashing power a cryptocurrency's network has the more secure and resistant to attacks it is. Security is the number one most important aspect of a cryptocurrency. This sort of a network effect has already placed Bitcoin in a ""too big to fail"" (literally and figuratively) position. This, plus what almkglor said about how Bitcoin is an open-source protocol that is flexible can evolve and adopt any newer innovations as the industry advances, is what basically makes Bitcoin the one and only blockchain needed. Why make a new alt coin when anyone can just implement their new idea to the largest and best blockchain out there? It's not a private company like Myspace or Facebook, where developers are hired to try and make a better product than the other company. It is an open-source software where people voluntarily add their code to further innovate a tool with no single creator, owner, ceo, board of directors, etc... And for blockchain applications that don't really make sense to build directly into the Bitcoin protocol, you can just build a 2nd layer application on top of the Bitcoin blockchain that leverages its hash power and network to fulfill whatever alternate use case you're trying to acheive, just like anyone can build an application on top of TCP/IP.";1;0;False;Raster_Eyes;e3ydmgl;Bitcoin has stabilized?;95upw4;https://i.redd.it/0hfg960i61f11.jpg

"When people talk about bitcoin fundamentals they are talking about adoption, integration, infrastructure building, 2nd layer application development, etc... Things that show the technology is growing in either use or utility, basically. For example:

The announcement that ICE (who own the NYSE) is creating a federally-regulated crypto ecosystem allowing for a simple point of sale solution for big companies to accept bitcoin. They are calling it BAKKT, and they are saying they've been working on it quietly for a while and should be ready to roll it out in November. 

The fact that Lightning Network is now running on mainnet and growing quickly in capacity, and people are developing apps that run on it.

The fact that more and more people are using bitcoin as part of their investment portfolios. And more and more people are using it for remittences as well.

Goldman Sachs, one of the top ten biggest institutional investors in the world, recently announced plans for a ‘Crypto Custody’ offering.

These are the kind of things people are talking about when referring to ""bitcoin fundamentals"". Bitcoin isn't a company, nor a stock. It is a digital money that is built into and inseparable from a payment processor, something we've never seen before, so it can't be judged using the same methods as the more traditional assets that we're used to. This is why price discovery has been so wildly volatile with bitcoin, because it something completely fresh and new and no one really knows how to value it yet, although some people are coming up with some pretty good metrics. Also volatile because of its relatively minuscule market cap, obviously. I strongly suggest checking out these two articles for a more in depth analysis on bitcoin valuation. The first one covers interesting new methods for calculating its value, the second one breaks down how bitcoin has intrinsic value:

You guys aren't dropping truth bombs, this shit is exactly like betting on horses and which horse(coin) will win the race. When people bet on horses they look at past performances and the circumstances of each horse that won a race and based on those prior wins/conditions you can bet on a horse(coin) that is likely to perform well in the next race you bet on. Comparing this to crypto, based on past performance, crypto has always climbed and collapsed but eventually recovered, so everyone buying now is betting on that future recovery based on past performances of this space and it's current circumstances. Does that mean it WILL go back up, no, however if you like to take a gamble and look at past trends it seems like it will eventually happen again.  This is all a gamble guys, don't use money that you are afraid to lose, and if you buy a coin, better make damn sure you believe in that coin because holding for the next run up will be really hard without believing in the coins you purchase.;1;0;False;;e3xznlo;Bitcoin has stabilized?;95upw4;https://i.redd.it/0hfg960i61f11.jpg
