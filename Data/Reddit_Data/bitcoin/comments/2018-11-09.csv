But anyway, do you not know that graft and corruption are intensely common, especially in places like Venezuela? Where are all these news stories about it happening 10's of thousands of times per day around the world? Is it really so far-fetched to you that border agents in Venezuela are often extorting people trying to flee the country (and that you don't really hear about it)?

Anyway I'm glad you've (I assume) never been burned by your bank or credit card or anyone else.  For me, I've had enough random unexpected things happen to me that I now spend a little more time thinking about avoiding unnecessary risks.

"But he's right.  There's 99% security if you memorize your key, someone could still torture or threaten you to death for your key.  But if you keep your key on an object, it's much easier to steal or confiscate physically.  If you keep the keys on the cloud, cloud providers can freeze your access to that file in no time, governments with their guns basically just need to ask.  If your encryption is weak, then they can actually get your coins, on top of simply locking you out of them. 

Now that being said,  STRONGLY ENCRYPTING a file with your keys and saving it in the cloud for a day of travel is going to be fine for nearly everyone (especially if you dont give yourself a reputation of being a holder of cryptos).   Just be sure to transfer your wealth into fresh new keys when your safely at your destination.  Take strong security measures in all of your online and offline dealings and you'll be fine.  

The fact that keys are so valuable now leads to a great side effect...it gets everyone thinking about data security in a whole new light.  It's one thing to secure your bank account credentials (where you are insured and can get your money back if those credentials are stolen (maybe)), but securing 24 words worth a million dollars is an entirely different animal!
