And people in general have a problem with knowing what words actually mean. We're in a thread specifically talking about systems of currency, the only appropriate use of the word 'inflation' in this context is its technical definition, which refers specifically to the topic at hand.

Supply chain problems causing the price of an item to rise temporarily has nothing to do with inflation in any meaningful sense.

"Inflation is when the supply of a given currency increased, the prices of goods and services rising is a measure of inflation, it's not inflation itself. Likewise, deflation is a retraction of the currency supply.

Bitcoin is inherently an inflationary currency. The supply of the currency is increasing constantly at a set interval, and never decreases, it is never technically deflationary. Hoarding of the currency can cause functional deflation, as there's less active currency in the supply being circulated, so the demand for the coins themselves can go up and the dollar value goes up with it. That itself is not technical deflation.

> Not in any way. The amount you can buy with it shifts constantly.

In the only way that really matters, the actual supply of the coins themselves. The amount you can buy of any item with any currency shifts constantly.

Using your framing, the price of a bitcoin rising in USD is ""inflation"" and the price falling is ""deflation"", but at the same time, the relative purchasing power of the bitcoin is either growing which would be ""deflation"", or it's shrinking which would be ""inflation"". 

The way you're using the term, bitcoin is both inflationary and deflationary at the exact same time. How is that a productive use of language?

"I invested in both LTC and BCH when I first got into crypto.  Both are great for moving value around, but there is nothing BCH can do that LTC can't do equally as well or better.  Not to mention that Charlie is a way better crypto ambassador than Roger (by a fucking country mile), and the LTC community isn't complete cancer.  The more I learned about BCH, the more I wanted out.     

Thank goodness BCH pumped the last week+ so I could sell my whole stack for profit.  I still think BCH is a decent project, but holy shit do I dislike the people associated with it.  Funny enough, if they stuck with the ""it's like Bitcoin, *but better*"" angle that most new coins use, I would be fine with it.  I'm even cool with the name Bitcoin Cash.  But they had to start bloviating about ""Satoshi's vision"" (like any of these idiots know Satoshi, what his current thoughts are on BTC, etc.) and using extremely deceptive tactics to confuse newcomers.

I would be hesitant to call for fungibility in Bitcoin in its current state. This is mostly because at the very best, a confidential transaction (one implementation to fungibility) will be 3 times the size of a regular transaction. Confidential transaction alone doesn't solve the fungibility issue, it needs to be coupled with coin-join style shuffling to work, making the congestion on Bitcoin network much, much worse (if everyone starts using it).

We could be looking at sustained congestion (like the one we had 2017 May and Dec, 2018 Jan)";0;0;False;O93mzzz;dy2l4z8;Fake or Fork;8fafgu;https://i.redd.it/txeoy1hp8fu01.jpg

"**Streisand effect**

The Streisand effect is the phenomenon whereby an attempt to hide, remove, or censor a piece of information has the unintended consequence of publicizing the information more widely, usually facilitated by the Internet. It is an example of psychological reactance, wherein once people are aware that some information is being kept from them, their motivation to access and spread it is increased.It is named after American entertainer Barbra Streisand, whose 2003 attempt to suppress photographs of her residence in Malibu, California, inadvertently drew further public attention to it. Similar attempts have been made, for example, in cease-and-desist letters to suppress files, websites, and even numbers. Instead of being suppressed, the information receives extensive publicity and media extensions such as videos and spoof songs, often being widely mirrored on the Internet or distributed on file-sharing networks.

Bch was created because part of the community didn't believe segwit and off chain scaling solutions were a good idea and wanted to keep transactions on chain. Bitcoin has a 1 mb block size and Bitcoin cash has a 8 mb block size which will be changed to 32 mb in I think a month. The higher block size can handle a higher amount of transactions but with a bigger blockchain to store for people who are running a node. When lightning is released it should be faster than any on chain solution but I think that it isn't the best solution.

Moore's law applies to the density of transistors in a given space. It has nothing to do with storage capacity. Moore's law is not even a true law, it is really an observation. It likely soon will no longer be true.

Hard drive space is far from the only concern. To even state that hard drive space is the main concern is an infantile approach to the issue. Bandwidth data limits and network latency have absolutely nothing to do with the cost per TB for storage.

"Bitcoin *is defined* by what the majority thinks. The consensus mechanism is designed so that the majority chain is what all the ""honest"" software nodes running  take as the correct chain.

""Honest"" here does not mean ""running by the original rules"". The rules of Bitcoin have changed in the past, but the majority have decided to go with the rules that exist now. ""Honest"" just means that they're not dishonest (ie, trying to intentionally game the system in their favor). The parameters can change, as long as the means of achieving the same consensus exists. If Bitcoin somehow does manage to get hijacked by dishonest nodes, then the whole experiment has failed, and we would need to come up with other ways to achieve consensus.

It's likely that if there were such a tight split of 51%/49%, that the difference would not be able to be determined accurately anyway and people would flock towards the chain which had either the highest value (relative to other cryptocurrencies), in which case the markets would decide which is the ""real Bitcoin"".

What's missing here is that in order to gather up enough heads to want to adapt breaking changes, there would be lots of attention about the issue and people would come up with names ahead of the split. Such names would likely persist after the split if it were tightly contested. If there were a clear winner then the winner would be Bitcoin.

Bitcoin will come under these kinds of attacks, and we can't just rely on mining majority or guesswork on which chain is going to be adopted by a majority. Going forward we will need to utilize other consensus mechanisms in addition to PoW, such as PoS. In particular, we probably want prediction markets which would enable us to figure out ahead of time where the market will decide to move, or whether or not an issue is unlikely to achieve consensus on a 50/50 split.";0;1;False;DistinctSituation;dy249y8;Erik Voorhees: “Roger - please stop referencing me to back up your opinion that Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin.

Sorry, I think I may have got that the wrong way around. Its possible to create a block that would be invalid to a SegWit node, but valid to a non-segwit node (e.g. Looks like a SegWit block, but breaks the rules of SegWit). Practically that hasn't happened, and if it did it would get orphaned assuming 50+% of miners enforce SegWit rules correctly. But it's the reason that a soft fork requires 50+% hash rate support to activate safely.;3;0;False;chriswheeler;dy1uuj8;Erik Voorhees: “Roger - please stop referencing me to back up your opinion that Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin.

"If 70% of miners moved started mining invalid blocks, the network would fork into two, and people running full nodes would need to decide which of the two chains they want to take as the real one.

If the majority of merchants decided to remain on the 30% mining one, for example, then the 70% of miners would be wasting their hashing power on a chain that few, or nobody is going to use. They would soon realize it's not in their interest and move back their hashing power to the chain people are using for trade.

But if merchants (full node users) followed the miners, such that the majority of full nodes were on the 70% hashing power (with changed rules), then this new chain would effectively become Bitcoin, because it's the majority chain, following the rules of the majority.

This is why you shouldn't listen to garbage from the BCash crew where they allege that non-mining nodes are useless. It's absolutely not the case. The network majority of validating nodes decides the correct chain via economic incentives and those incentives are not limited to just mining. The opposite is kind of true. Merchants need to treat miners as a potentially adverse agent in the network, and should treat every ""invalid"" action by miners as an attack on the network, unless the merchant has previously opted-in to a network change proposal.

I think there certainly can be a UAHF (User activated hard fork), where nodes signal their intent to move onto a specific chain at a particular block height, and if the majority of nodes do opt to change the rules, these new rules become part of the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin isn't defined by the rules that were put in place on day 1, and can certainly change if the majority will it.

So it's not true that ""miners work for hodlers"". If you hodl but do not run a full node, you don't really get to vote. Miners only need to be honest to other people running full nodes.

The only problem with achieving some kind of UAHF is that miners could attempt to coerce it for their benefit via sybil attacks. That's why it's not simply enough to have a voting mechanism built into clients. Other voting/governance mechanisms will be required going forward as the network comes under these kinds of attacks.";6;1;False;DistinctSituation;dy1ucfg;Erik Voorhees: “Roger - please stop referencing me to back up your opinion that Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin.

"> Come on, this is melodramatic nonsense. Grow up.

No, downplaying the massive destruction to the ecosystem that erik is 100% *personally* responsible for (as one of the S2X signatories) is not appropriate either. Lets not forget erik's ""overwhelming consensus"" statements when trying to force the rest of the community into his and other monopolies centralization attempts.

We can both accept that what he did here is good, and that what he did before with S2X was *really, really bad*.

And yes, I can quite clearly state  that centralization is the enemy of bitcoin. Erik *strongly* advocated for S2X, which would have resulted in massive centralization. We had a large amount of developers that outright stated that if S2X became bitcoin, then they would have lost interest in developing towards the project. That would have left the talent pool behind, leading to a few rookies taking over the codebase, leading to developer centralization which is just as bad as mining centralization.

And this is perfect 20/20 in hindsight, are we going to forget about [the S2X hardfork one off rookie error by jeff garzik](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7dky8f/segwit2x_fork_has_failed_2_blocks_before_it_was/dpyowr3/) that would have caused the bitcoin network to come to a crashing halt?

This is exactly the kind of rookie bullshit we have to avoid, which can only be sustained through a vibrant diverse open source decentralized developer ecosystems.

Unlike *insert 99.9% of other crypto projects here*, which have massive developer centralization issues, leading to....ironically as garzik would say....""The priests replacing the kings"", leading to the same issues that centralized systems have had age after age.

"It's not as simple to say that the 'users' control bitcoin. There are layers of complexity with how bitcoin enforces consensus.  You've got the speculators who are interested in price action and volatility, they are what determines price. There are companies and merchants, who are mostly beholden to the speculators -- these companies run full nodes and currency pairings which determine what market activity happens on which blockchain.  The developers provide the software which these economically important nodes are using to conduct business and are especially influential regarding consensus breaking protocol decisions.  The miners provide security to the network through their work and a mechanism for which to validate transactions.  Consumers who use bitcoin to conduct everyday business can also be influential-- albeit in a more limited capacity, since they have less of an impact on price.

Because they won't switch to 100% bcash...because the USER BASE is not there. ""

Clearly this means that the reason the hash power is not there is because the users have decided that the real bitcoin is still bitcoin.

">Bitcoin is defined by what the majority thinks. The consensus mechanism is designed so that the majority chain is what all the ""honest"" software nodes running take as the correct chain.

No it's not. Bitcoin is NOT a democracy. People can create their own altcoin if they don't like the current consensus rules of Bitcoin. You can hard fork all you want, but if there is no wide consensus that the fork is necessary the fork can never be Bitcoin. Ever heard of tyranny of the majority? That's what's going to happen if a small majority can decide on new rules, and it would completely destroy the trust people have in the code and immutability of the blockchain. This is why a hard fork requires pretty much the entire ecosystem to agree, not just a small majority.

"If things had been reversed and BTC had been the chain to increase block size while BCH capped blocks at 1MB necessitating 2nd layer solutions I truly believe that version of BCH would be outside of the CMC top 100 and BTC would be worth more than it is now.

Do many people actually disagree with this? As the fork BCH had a massively uphill battle from the beginning.

I think a lot of the reason Bitcoin maintains its position is simply the name and associated status combined with newcomer ignorance (and lets face it; the ignorance of most people in general) and people just wanting to keep their investment propped up which is reasonable but may not be optimal in the long run.

Why couldn't Core increase BTC's block size a reasonable amount like 4mb which would still allow simple machines to run nodes? Then we would have never had the massive mempool clogging in NOV/DEC that damaged BTC's reputation and adoption levels.

Very very long way to go /u/evoorhees , but at least its a step in the right direction. He is still clearly mislead about this whole ""miners have the power to choose what is bitcoin"" concept. 

Essentially, Erik has cherry picked satoshi's words and ignored his other writings. Here is a great [old post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/744vv0/one_good_thing_that_will_come_out_of_the_november/dnvp7b1/) that goes into the why Erik (and others) are so mislead....

>Satoshi's remark in the [release notes of 0.3.19](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/release-notes/release-notes-0.3.19.md):

>""Safe mode can still be triggered by seeing a longer (greater total PoW) invalid block chain.""

>Clearly, Satoshi says here that even though a chain with more total hashpower may exist, it can still be invalid. This is in direct contradiction with the fabricated lie of S2X and its ilk being that the blockchain having the greater total hashpower would be Bitcoin.

I might point out that these remarks from satoshi are over 1 year *after* the whitepaper release, meaning they are more well formed concepts that satoshi had time to think through after a year of bitcoin existing. This quote right here demonstrates that satoshi thought there could be instances in which there was a ""higher accumulation of proof of work"" on an **invalid** chain.

Clearly his opinion on the subject was evolving, and would have continued to evolve had he been around. Its pointless to speculate ""what would he think now"", because one ....satoshi is not god, and two, he decided to leave, and pandering to a fasle prophet serves no one.

There are no gods in bitcoinland. People who fall prey to this ""we MUST trust SOMEONE"" ideology are the idiots that keep reinventing/enabling the same stupid centralized systems that fail over and over.

Block validity needs to be enforced; Bitcoin does not work if not.

As you see, full-block validity, not only header validity, is necessary or incentives fall apart if not.

Erik Voorhees makes a problematic statement here, implying that a fork only needs to gain a majority to be called Bitcoin. Bitcoin is not ruled by a majority, it is ruled by consensus. If all it takes is a 51% majority for the consensus rules to change, Bitcoin would become extremely vulnerable to political attacks and we can no longer trust the code itself and consensus. In the future when Bitcoin becomes more mainstream I would imagine a media and political campaign could easily sway public opinion to increase the 21M coin limit, and Erik Voorhees would be fine with this if only 51% would agree.

"The consensus rules can be changed through... consensus. In fact, the article I linked about Bitcoin not being ruled by miners talks about a specific possible hardfork:

> If, rather than mining invalid blocks which are just ignored, a majority of miners attack the network (eg. by double-spending transactions or refusing to confirm any transactions), then the Bitcoin economy must execute a hardfork to change the proof-of-work (PoW) function, getting rid of these bad miners in favor of new ones. If it was impossible for the Bitcoin economy to change the PoW in opposition to miners, then Bitcoin *would* be ruled by miners (and therefore insecure for the reasons explained earlier), since there would be no recourse against attack. But in reality, miners can't do anything about a hardfork, so it doesn't matter how much hashrate they have. Once a PoW change (or any other hardfork) is being done, it becomes an economic issue rather than a technical issue, and the amount of hashrate or number of nodes or any other technical parameter are almost completely meaningless.

"The idea of SegWit being a ""soft fork"" is that **all nodes** see SegWit transactions as valid, even if they don't support the feature.

This works because bitcoin's scripting language treats any non-zero value on the top of the stack as ""true"" after running the script, which means the transaction is valid. SegWit transactions leave a signature on the stack of client's which don't support the feature, so they still validate and accept the transaction.
