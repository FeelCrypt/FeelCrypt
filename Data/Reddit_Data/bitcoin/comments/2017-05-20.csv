"open coinbase account.

link bank account

buy bitcoin.

Don't freak out when you have gained or lost 50% value in 3 months (or even days)  it isnt always so volatile.  

Remember that no holder, no matter how awful their luck, has lost anything on bitcoin.  The swings are not for the weak hearted...but do yourself a favor and just refuse to sell for less than you bought.

If you have a significant amount, get them out of coinbase and into your own wallet.  Wallets are a big can of worms that I'm not about to go into.  But being the only person who controls your coins is important for anyone with significant holdings.";12;3;False;laustcozz;dhtoj50;$2000!! Bitcoin is dead.

"No one can tell you this. It isn't the wisest idea to buy when the value is at an all time high. If I were you, I'd wait for a small crash, one is bound to happen sooner or later, even if it's just a $300 dip. Some people will assure you that a $2000 bitcoin is incredibly cheap compared to what it will cost in a few years. They could be right, but a bitcoin could just as well be worth nothing in a few years.

I bought 3800€ worth of bitcoins two months ago after a dip to add to the bitcoins I already own and the 3800€ turned into 6533€. I believe that I should sell for 6533€ and wait for a dip to buy 6533€ worth of bitcoins, but I'm too scared to risk it. I still think that a small crash is bound to happen, just not willing to put my bitcoins where my mouth is.";9;3;False;Exotemporal;dhtoitj;$2000!! Bitcoin is dead.
