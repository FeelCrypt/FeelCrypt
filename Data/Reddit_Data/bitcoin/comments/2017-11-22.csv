Yes it does.   Technical change is guaranteed to upset users if the constraints of the system mean that change is mathematically required to restrict the  operation  in a way that is known would in theory impact an end user's  costs or workflow;   In this case the in-place change of allocating more databits for divisibility  reduces the number of bits available for  representing large magnitudes.

> I asked for a reference and you jump on to give examples

I have given you the authoritative reference, which is the demonstrable details  that derive directly from mathematics,  the protocol specification, and the mechanics of the C programming language,  and now the burden of proof is on you to show how such an outlandish, extraordinary, and counterintuitive claim of ""infinite divisibility""  could possibly be serviced   without any of the caveats and problems explained.

> Back in the early days (~2011) it was anyways accepted as fact 
> that bitcoin would be ""infinitely divisible""

And back in the 1600s it was anyways accepted as fact that the earth was an entirely flat surface.    Matter of fact,  some folks still make that claim that to this day  in spite of empirical observations and mathematical calculations  that show it as an indefensible argument.

Your claims are on a par with the flat-earthers,  And it's not the round-earthers'  job to   try and find more round-earthers' to disagree with you ----  on the contrary,   when you make such extraordinary claims of infinite divisibility,  the burden of proof is on the person making that claim to show how it is so.....

This would need to changes from the userbase etc. only a stupid dev would force a change of behavior to the userbase.

I asked for a reference and you jump on to give examples, but why should i believe a random stranger on reddit with not a single authoritative reference?

Actually, i'm not even that interested in this particular subject. Back in the early days (~2011) it was anyways accepted as fact that bitcoin would be ""infinitely divisible"" at least to the tune of practicability and wallets were back then limited on the number of decimal place for practical purposes.

"I never said old money was “bad” ... that would be a moral, value judgment on this situation. I am merely observing the current environment and what appears to be a new situation that thereby  requires a new type of currency. 

“Old money” (silver coins) was one of man kinds best achievements, inventions, etc ... I live in a town that minted some of the first silver coins in 500 BC. I don’t think that is “bad” at all. Quite the opposite. 

Moving from The gold standard to fiat also can be argued was another advancement on money ... because it showed that money didn’t have to be backed by a shiny mineral to have value. It just needed to have trust.

It being pseudo-decentralized (still running on centralized telecoms infrastructure and relying on centralized banking infrastructure to facilitate buying and selling), is not enough to make up for its shortcomings as a currency.

You could come up with a decentralized internet (which people have), but if it takes 10x longer than a centralized internet and costs 10x more to use people simply aren't going to use it (which is why decentralized internet hasn't taken off).

Use a major exchange, understand what fees are involved, and I'd personally recommend moving your coins out to a desktop wallet on a clean computer.  When transferring coins, double or triple check the receiving address, there is not a single way to recover coins sent to a wrong address.  

As for a wallet, I've used Electrum with success.  Make sure you get the real deal from a secure download source.  Then protect your seed as best you can, those words are the entirety of your bitcoin hodlings.  If someone else gets them or you lose them, you no longer have your coins.  So do not save them on a computer or on the internet anywhere.

No, I'm suggesting we not look to the government for answers to which the free market will solve.  This is a pattern that is constantly repeated and people never seem to learn the lesson. Government is not the solution most of the time, in fact it's usually the problem (ISPs are limited to few because of deals with municipal governments).

A Neutral Net was the de facto standard because ISPs didn't interfere with anything until high-bandwidth users came along. I'm sorry you have a short memory, but that's how it was. Just as the article states, there was no formal or clear legal protections of Net Neutrality prior to Title II in 2015, and that only came about because ISPs were testing the law and throttling to see what they could get away with. Title II nipped that in the bud and formalized what we already had. Prior to the early 2000s many people already didn't have great options for internet, so throttling consumers didn't make sense. Streaming video hadn't taken off by then either. After streaming video did take off, now people stopped subscribing to cable and ISPs were losing money that way, so throttling was a way for them to hamstring their competition like Netflix.

It's like the genetic engineering people saying that we're going to start playing god and have designer babies. Or the people saying that Artificial Intelligence will lead to killer robot overlords.

>  you can't take away consumer protection if there isn't a free market

Government cannot protect any consumer, nor create wealth, raise income or do anything positive with laws and regulations. Regulations are just words on a paper, they always mean a distorted market (one customer is ripped off on behalf of other) and/or higher costs (everyone pays for that benefit - it can't and never will come from the government). The only thing a government can do to help the markets function better for everyone is to defend property rights and enforce contracts, nothing more.

Example: here in Brazil we have a very strict ""consumer protection"" laws that costs companies a lot of money. Who pays that? The consumer, with higher prices, the same cars sold in USA cost double here. We also have one of the worst labor laws in the whole world, to ""protect the employees"", and what companies do to survive? Offer lower salaries than they would in a free market! They have to take into account a total costs of employment of at least 2x and sometimes rising to 2,5-3 times the salary when you take into account lawsuits. We could have double salaries for everyone just getting rid of all labor laws here.

You're not the first to suggest this. The reason why this hasn't happened is because the monopolies are literally written into the local laws. Early on the telecom companies made deals with cities to be the provider, barring anyone else from entering.

If you look at the Google Fiber project, they're trying their best to fix the situation, but it's not working. Google has more money and more resources than anyone else possibly could get together, and they're even having an unbelieveably tough time getting it done.

"Those ISPs in the 90s were, as you suggest, in a grey area of selling services that piggybacked off of private infrastructure that they leased. And it was slow, low-bandwidth (dialup) service. I once worked for a local ISP and they ran the operation out of a tiny storefront. They provided dialup internet service to probably 5k customers. Mom and pop operation to say the least. Yes, those days are gone, and that sucks, but is it even possible to run a ""Mom and Pop"" Fiber Optic ISP?

No doubt regulations make that much harder than it needs to be, but there is undoubtedly still huge barriers to entry from infrastructure requirements as well.

In my country (Canada), there are many small, local ISPs, so it would seem that our regulatory framework is more permissive. In my town, I have a choice between at least 8 ISPs. Or so it appears on the face. But most are re-sellers of Rogers (cable) or Bell Aliant (DSL/Fiber) service.

On the opposite side of the country, I again had 2 choices: Telus (DSL) or Shaw (cable), with a small number of re-sellers. Dialup service is still available in many places. The company I used to work for still exists and is now offering Cable and DSL plans as well as enterprise web hosting.

So perhaps the reason I don't quite understand the situation in the USA is because it's not taken to quite the same extreme in Canada. Consequently, I am not as anti-regulation as I might otherwise have become. Perhaps I should stay out of USA politics, because I'm pretty unfamiliar with it.

Nevertheless, our ISP oligopoly doesn't sound much better than your ISP monopoly.

"**Net neutrality**

The FCC just announced its plan to slash net neutrality rules, allowing ISPs like Verizon to block apps, slow websites, and charge fees to control what you see & do online. They vote December 14th. But if Congress gets enough calls, *they* can stop the FCC. https://www.battleforthenet.com/ Net neutrality is the principle that Internet service providers and governments regulating most of the Internet must treat all data on the Internet the same, and not discriminate or charge differently by user, content, website, platform, application, type of attached equipment, or method of communication. For instance, under these principles, internet service providers are unable to intentionally block, slow down or charge money for specific websites and online content.

FDIC is indirectly to protect government/fed monopoly on funny money since bank runs can happen on the fractional reserve system.  We are now building a new system that doesn't have these needs.

Social Security similarly is protecting government's hold on central management and taxation of wealth.  We have always had the ability to save for our own retirement and government's involvement has conveniently expanded their scope and involvement in the lives of citizens.

National parks and forest acts, I don't have enough knowledge of the specifics.

So create monopoly which stifles competition and then regulate that monopoly.  Seems like an odd approach.

> They are really really really basic facts.

Basic fact, the FCC is a central point of regulation that arguably is not necessary in this case if the market is allowed to work.  If ISPs price gouge then competitors will be happy to come steal their customers as long as competition is allowed to develop and free to leverage the same public infrastructure.

semantics. It works exactly the same way. A pension is literally a pool of money which pays out future benefits. Look at the definition of a pension -

>A pension may be a ""defined benefit plan"" where a fixed sum is paid regularly to a person, or a ""defined contribution plan"" under which a fixed sum is invested and then becomes available at retirement age.

"> History shows us that the free market holds corporations accountable

Show me. How does the ISP landscape in America closely resemble a free market? Free markets require competition. That's an inconvenient truth that corporations, conservatives, and free-market advocates love to forget about. We have an [FCC headed by a Verizon lawyer who goes to court to argue that 1 ISP in a given area constitutes competition.](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/10/fccs-claim-that-one-isp-counts-as-competition-faces-scrutiny-in-court/)
If you have faith in the free market, why are you OK with losing Net Neutrality? A free market is precisely what it protects. We have an even playing field on the internet, and we are going to lose that. Now instead of competing with Netflix by offering better service (IE the crux of a free market system) they are able to simply hamstring them so their in-house service becomes the better option. That's not free market, that's corporate sabotage.

>I'll use the cell phone industry as an example...

There is competition in the mobile market because of its nature there are no local monopolies. What about the bigger problem of non-mobile customers? Local monopolies left and right. That was the case well before Title II came along. Municipal ISPs can't pop up because ISPs fight them tooth and nail. Private ISPs can't pop up because ISPs will block them, destroy them, and make it prohibitively expensive. Where is the free market?

"And also, I get the argument of ""just because they CAN screw with customers doesn't mean that they WILL"" screw with customers.

And to that, I present a sample of the actions by many ISPs that caused net neutrality protections in the first place:

(credit to /u/The_Brutally_Honest ):

MADISON RIVER: In 2005, North Carolina ISP Madison River Communications blocked the voice-over-internet protocol (VOIP) service Vonage. Vonage filed a complaint with the FCC after receiving a slew of customer complaints. The FCC stepped in to sanction Madison River and prevent further blocking, but it lacks the authority to stop this kind of abuse today.

COMCAST: In 2005, the nation’s largest ISP, Comcast, began secretly blocking peer-to-peer technologies that its customers were using over its network. Users of services like BitTorrent and Gnutella were unable to connect to these services. 2007 investigations from the Associated Press, the Electronic Frontier Foundation and others confirmed that Comcast was indeed blocking or slowing file-sharing applications without disclosing this fact to its customers.

TELUS: In 2005, Canada’s second-largest telecommunications company, Telus, began blocking access to a server that hosted a website supporting a labor strike against the company. Researchers at Harvard and the University of Toronto found that this action resulted in Telus blocking an additional 766 unrelated sites.

AT&T: From 2007–2009, AT&T forced Apple to block Skype and other competing VOIP phone services on the iPhone. The wireless provider wanted to prevent iPhone users from using any application that would allow them to make calls on such “over-the-top” voice services. The Google Voice app received similar treatment from carriers like AT&T when it came on the scene in 2009.

WINDSTREAM: In 2010, Windstream Communications, a DSL provider with more than 1 million customers at the time, copped to hijacking user-search queries made using the Google toolbar within Firefox. Users who believed they had set the browser to the search engine of their choice were redirected to Windstream’s own search portal and results.

MetroPCS: In 2011, MetroPCS, at the time one of the top-five U.S. wireless carriers, announced plans to block streaming video over its 4G network from all sources except YouTube. MetroPCS then threw its weight behind Verizon’s court challenge against the FCC’s 2010 open internet ruling, hoping that rejection of the agency’s authority would allow the company to continue its anti-consumer practices.

PAXFIRE: In 2011, the Electronic Frontier Foundation found that several small ISPs were redirecting search queries via the vendor Paxfire. The ISPs identified in the initial Electronic Frontier Foundation report included Cavalier, Cogent, Frontier, Fuse, DirecPC, RCN and Wide Open West. Paxfire would intercept a person’s search request at Bing and Yahoo and redirect it to another page. By skipping over the search service’s results, the participating ISPs would collect referral fees for delivering users to select websites.

AT&T, SPRINT and VERIZON: From 2011–2013, AT&T, Sprint and Verizon blocked Google Wallet, a mobile-payment system that competed with a similar service called Isis, which all three companies had a stake in developing.

EUROPE: A 2012 report from the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications found that violations of Net Neutrality affected at least one in five users in Europe. The report found that blocked or slowed connections to services like VOIP, peer-to-peer technologies, gaming applications and email were commonplace.
VERIZON: In 2012, the FCC caught Verizon Wireless blocking people from using tethering applications on their phones. Verizon had asked Google to remove 11 free tethering applications from the Android marketplace. These applications allowed users to circumvent Verizon’s $20 tethering fee and turn their smartphones into Wi-Fi hot spots. By blocking those applications, Verizon violated a Net Neutrality pledge it made to the FCC as a condition of the 2008 airwaves auction.

AT&T: In 2012, AT&T announced that it would disable the FaceTime video-calling app on its customers’ iPhones unless they subscribed to a more expensive text-and-voice plan. AT&T had one goal in mind: separating customers from more of their money by blocking alternatives to AT&T’s own products.
VERIZON: During oral arguments in Verizon v. FCC in 2013, judges asked whether the phone giant would favor some preferred services, content or sites over others if the court overruled the agency’s existing open internet rules. Verizon counsel Helgi Walker had this to say: “I’m authorized to state from my client today that but for these rules we would be exploring those types of arrangements.” Walker’s admission might have gone unnoticed had she not repeated it on at least five separate occasions during arguments.

This is a false argument.  This generation of people are not on social security because they got fucked over, they are on it because it's sold as a retirement plan when it's anything but.

> Social security is paid into dude. You get points on every single tax return you file and when you accrue enough points (I think its 40 points?) you get SS benefits when you retire.

>Where we disagree is our perception of reality. You seem to hold some fantasy land ideals where society would be ""better"" if we just fucked everyone over.

That's obviously not a fair characterization.  The thing I find striking is that you can make sound arguments when it comes to the S2X attack for example, logical and sound, but in this case you are clearly getting emotional.  Our country survived for 150 years without social programs and if anything society is headed on a down trend in terms of personal responsibility, despite being at an incredible technological cusp.  People are submitting to the state when 105 years ago (prior to 1913) their interaction would likely have been limited to their interactions with the Post office.  You're of course entitled to your opinion and belief that a nanny state is a better choice than a libertarian state, but in this country you might want to be open to the ideas of others and leave the emotions at home.  

I also find it hard to reconcile being a supporter of a technology that is thriving specifically because it is not controlled by the state and your position of apparent statism.

 Often these bills have a misrepresentation PR name, for example the ""Affordable Care Act"" which has seen massive price increases and despite claims we could keep our plans and doctors, that is generally not true.

Are you sure that you're not just buying the PR?

ISPs have an incentive to provide the service their customers want, and if they don't they leave holes for the free market to exploit.  Many times government, in the name of protecting people's interest, has instead created burdensome regulation which hurts smaller players and centralizes power with the larger players who have the resources to comply with those regulations (or who had a hand in drafting them specifically to give themselves an advantage).

Why would Bitcoin supporters support a money that derives value specifically because it is not controlled by government and then be welcoming of legislation that regulates the internet?

"I don't see any of the situations you posted as being a problem government needed to solve.  Most were providers protecting their investment by not allowing users to exploit their service.  For example a plan priced for a phone that was instead used to tether a PC would clearly be outside the intent of the plan and likely said so in the user's contract.

Forcing ISPs to allow their competition to use their own infrastructure isn't good for competition, it's bad for providing incentive for investment in infrastructure.

If we let actual competition happen we see prices come down and utility go up.  We see this with Bitcoin.  Banks are so highly regulated with such a high barrier to entry that the customer truly gets screwed.  Bitcoin, as in free market money, will clearly disrupt that market.  The same holds for ISPs if we allow competition.

Also, entrenched ISPs that choose to screw their customers will be that much more likely to lose them to smaller competition that offers a more open internet.  Wireless has evolved incredibly over the last 10 years and stands to completely disrupt wired ISPs.

Prior to 1895, Duluth, Minnesota, was served by five electric lighting companies, and Scranton, Pennsylvania, had four in 1906. … During the latter part of the 19th century, competition was the usual situation in the gas industry in this country. Before 1884, six competing companies were operating in New York City … competition was common and especially persistent in the telephone industry … Baltimore, Chicago, Cleveland, Columbus, Detroit, Kansas City, Minneapolis, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and St. Louis, among the larger cities, had at least two telephone services in 1905.""

The reason competition doesn't move in is because — *to facilitate the creation of high speed networks* — regional governments will grant guarantees to telecoms so that the risk profile of investing billions of dollars in laying down cable is reduced to a minimum.

Without these guarantees, no investor in their right mind would take on the risk of creating a high-speed network. They'd be better off parking their money into other projects, with a guaranteed rate of return.

The alternative is — Just have the public create the high speed networks and cut out the telecoms altogether. 

Do we want that? Do you want your State Government floating a $10B bond so that they can subcontract to 500 different entities that will charge outrageous day rates and eventually turn what was once estimated to be a $20B project into a $60B project?

"> no one was complaining about massive ISP censorship.

Most people against these laws say that ""there was never this problem before"" or ""Net Neutrality is trying to solve a problem that doesn't exist"", but that's wrong. Net Neutrality isn't a proactive regulation, it is reactive.

Here's a brief history of what the internet companies were doing that triggered Net Neutrality to be put in place:

MADISON RIVER:  In 2005, North Carolina ISP Madison River Communications blocked the voice-over-internet protocol (VOIP) service Vonage. Vonage filed a complaint with the FCC after receiving a slew of customer complaints. The FCC stepped in to sanction Madison River and prevent further blocking, but it lacks the authority to stop this kind of abuse today.

COMCAST: In 2005, the nation’s largest ISP, Comcast, began secretly blocking peer-to-peer technologies that its customers were using over its network. Users of services like BitTorrent and Gnutella were unable to connect to these services. 2007 investigations from the Associated Press, the Electronic Frontier Foundation and others confirmed that Comcast was indeed blocking or slowing file-sharing applications without disclosing this fact to its customers.

TELUS: In 2005, Canada’s second-largest telecommunications company, Telus, began blocking access to a server that hosted a website supporting a labor strike against the company. Researchers at Harvard and the University of Toronto found that this action resulted in Telus blocking an additional 766 unrelated sites.

AT&T: From 2007–2009, AT&T forced Apple to block Skype and other competing VOIP phone services on the iPhone. The wireless provider wanted to prevent iPhone users from using any application that would allow them to make calls on such “over-the-top” voice services. The Google Voice app received similar treatment from carriers like AT&T when it came on the scene in 2009.

WINDSTREAM: In 2010, Windstream Communications, a DSL provider with more than 1 million customers at the time, copped to hijacking user-search queries made using the Google toolbar within Firefox. Users who believed they had set the browser to the search engine of their choice were redirected to Windstream’s own search portal and results.

MetroPCS: In 2011, MetroPCS, at the time one of the top-five U.S. wireless carriers, announced plans to block streaming video over its 4G network from all sources except YouTube. MetroPCS then threw its weight behind Verizon’s court challenge against the FCC’s 2010 open internet ruling, hoping that rejection of the agency’s authority would allow the company to continue its anti-consumer practices.

PAXFIRE: In 2011, the Electronic Frontier Foundation found that several small ISPs were redirecting search queries via the vendor Paxfire. The ISPs identified in the initial Electronic Frontier Foundation report included Cavalier, Cogent, Frontier, Fuse, DirecPC, RCN and Wide Open West. Paxfire would intercept a person’s search request at Bing and Yahoo and redirect it to another page. By skipping over the search service’s results, the participating ISPs would collect referral fees for delivering users to select websites. 

AT&T, SPRINT and VERIZON: From 2011–2013, AT&T, Sprint and Verizon blocked Google Wallet, a mobile-payment system that competed with a similar service called Isis, which all three companies had a stake in developing.

EUROPE: A 2012 report from the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications found that violations of Net Neutrality affected at least one in five users in Europe. The report found that blocked or slowed connections to services like VOIP, peer-to-peer technologies, gaming applications and email were commonplace. 

VERIZON: In 2012, the FCC caught Verizon Wireless blocking people from using tethering applications on their phones. Verizon had asked Google to remove 11 free tethering applications from the Android marketplace. These applications allowed users to circumvent Verizon’s $20 tethering fee and turn their smartphones into Wi-Fi hot spots. By blocking those applications, Verizon violated a Net Neutrality pledge it made to the FCC as a condition of the 2008 airwaves auction.

AT&T: In 2012, AT&T announced that it would disable the FaceTime video-calling app on its customers’ iPhones unless they subscribed to a more expensive text-and-voice plan. AT&T had one goal in mind: separating customers from more of their money by blocking alternatives to AT&T’s own products. 

VERIZON: During oral arguments in Verizon v. FCC in 2013, judges asked whether the phone giant would favor some preferred services, content or sites over others if the court overruled the agency’s existing open internet rules. Verizon counsel Helgi Walker had this to say: “I’m authorized to state from my client today that but for these rules we would be exploring those types of arrangements.” Walker’s admission might have gone unnoticed had she not repeated it on at least five separate occasions during arguments.

I'll copy and paste it from another redditor:

""I don't think anyone is against the concept of Net Neutrality. The disagreement is in implementation and efficacy. The arguments against Title II are that:

A) It's a 1930s regulation that has nothing to do with net neutrality. It has 47 sections, but the FCC claims it will only apply 6 of those sections to broadband for now. They can change their interpretation and enforce all 47 sections at any moment. The net neutrality language that's enforced is ""All practices must be just and reasonable,"" where the FCC decides the definition of just and reasonable. The law is completely left up to interpretation.

B) Because the regulation is so vague and heavy handed, the reporting requirements are expensive and don't scale down for small ISPs. This gives large ISPs a competitive advantage. When Title II was first implemented, small ISPs were given a waiver. However this waiver was taken away last year. If you follow the debate, this was the trigger point for Pai to fight against Title II. Most of his lobby money comes from small ISP groups, and he fought hard to keep the waiver. When the waiver was lost, his only choice was to begin fighting to kill Title II completely.

C) Title II does not protect net neutrality. Right now Riot Games (makers of League of Legends) pays ISPs to redirect player traffic to their private backbone to reduce lag. This is a private fast lane that violates net neutrality yet is legal under Title II. It's probably legal because of point A: Title II is a vague 1930's regulation with nothing to do with net neutrality.

The brilliant part of this debate is that it has been sold as net neutrality vs no net neutrality. Of course everyone wants net neutrality.

"I know what net neutrality is. I was just pointing out that we currently have net neutrality. That fact somewhat weakens the “we shouldn’t let the government pass net neutrality” argument that I’ve seen here unsettlingly often.

Also, if your only argument against net neutrality is that it’s a “regulation”, that’s not an argument. Yes, regulations create costs for companies. Yes, certain regulations can cause more problems than they solve. But that isn’t an argument for why we shouldn’t have any regulations at all.

Also, ISPs would form monopolies with or without net neutrality. Firstly, because ISPs require a massive amount of capital to start. A new ISP is always at a tremendous disadvantage in terms of the price they can afford to offer customers.

Secondly, because building the infrastructure for an ISP requires gaining access to a large web of land. This is made easier by governments letting them run lines along side the roads, but that also means that small municipal governments have control over new ISP creating.

You’re thinking very simplistically about a very complex issue. Getting rid of net neutrality doesn’t magically deregulate ISPs. They will still be in a very imperfectly competitive market, even if net neutrality gets repealed. The only difference is that internet content providers will no longer have a low barrier to entry, and will have to do whatever the ISPs want them to.

And no, most people can’t just switch ISPs. For the reasons explained above, most peoples ISP options are limited to [one or two providers](http://www.esa.doc.gov/under-secretary-blog/how-much-competition-exists-among-isps).

"no it wouldn't. read the actual net neutrality documents. yeah it is a daunting and repetitive piece over 300 pages. net neutrality is an in your face example of double think.

Netflix threw a tantrum about getting charged more for the bandwidth that is used (infrastructure and networks are expensive). So they went to the fcc about it with other streaming services and cried about it. then made the completely false claims that isp's are going to block sites. ISP's aren't going to do that no matter how crappy they are with customer service. it would easily allow competition to come in. they don't want that (which, surprise surprise, Net Neutrality regulations out the smaller competitions).

it would only effect consumers who stream netflix 20+ hours a week. 

remember before net neutrality? probably not, maybe you too. people paid 50+ a month at one time for dial up. eventually that got cheaper because infrastructure and technology allowed it to get cheaper.

And I can see your point, but it is fundamentally wrong.

Net Neutrality wasn't a proactive move. It was a reactive move. You say you're a fan of bitcoin because of it's decentralization. That's good because that means you're on the side of Net Neutrality. Here's why:

Our internet is currently under Net Neutrality laws. Net Neutrality is what forces Internet Companies to ""treat all internet traffic as equal"". That means that Comcast, who owns NBC, can't make your connection to Fox News (their competitor) slower. They can't give you a better connection to their own services.

[Business Insider](http://www.businessinsider.com/net-neutralityfor-dummies-and-how-it-effects-you-2014-1) also explains it very well and puts it simply like this:

>""Net neutrality"" prevents Internet providers like Verizon and Comcast from dictating the kinds of content you're able to access online. Instead, Internet providers have to treat all traffic sources equally. Net neutrality is enforced by the Federal Communications Commission, or FCC.

Now, to the argument that ""they see a fake problem and want a fast, not thought thru, solution"". Net Neutrality doesn't solve a ""fake"" problem. The problem is real and it's actually what triggered Net Neutrality laws to be implemented in the first place.

Here's a brief history on what the internet companies were doing that triggered Net Neutrality to be put in place:

MADISON RIVER:  In 2005, North Carolina ISP Madison River Communications blocked the voice-over-internet protocol (VOIP) service Vonage. Vonage filed a complaint with the FCC after receiving a slew of customer complaints. The FCC stepped in to sanction Madison River and prevent further blocking, but it lacks the authority to stop this kind of abuse today.

COMCAST: In 2005, the nation’s largest ISP, Comcast, began secretly blocking peer-to-peer technologies that its customers were using over its network. Users of services like BitTorrent and Gnutella were unable to connect to these services. 2007 investigations from the Associated Press, the Electronic Frontier Foundation and others confirmed that Comcast was indeed blocking or slowing file-sharing applications without disclosing this fact to its customers.

TELUS: In 2005, Canada’s second-largest telecommunications company, Telus, began blocking access to a server that hosted a website supporting a labor strike against the company. Researchers at Harvard and the University of Toronto found that this action resulted in Telus blocking an additional 766 unrelated sites.

AT&T: From 2007–2009, AT&T forced Apple to block Skype and other competing VOIP phone services on the iPhone. The wireless provider wanted to prevent iPhone users from using any application that would allow them to make calls on such “over-the-top” voice services. The Google Voice app received similar treatment from carriers like AT&T when it came on the scene in 2009.

WINDSTREAM: In 2010, Windstream Communications, a DSL provider with more than 1 million customers at the time, copped to hijacking user-search queries made using the Google toolbar within Firefox. Users who believed they had set the browser to the search engine of their choice were redirected to Windstream’s own search portal and results.

MetroPCS: In 2011, MetroPCS, at the time one of the top-five U.S. wireless carriers, announced plans to block streaming video over its 4G network from all sources except YouTube. MetroPCS then threw its weight behind Verizon’s court challenge against the FCC’s 2010 open internet ruling, hoping that rejection of the agency’s authority would allow the company to continue its anti-consumer practices.

PAXFIRE: In 2011, the Electronic Frontier Foundation found that several small ISPs were redirecting search queries via the vendor Paxfire. The ISPs identified in the initial Electronic Frontier Foundation report included Cavalier, Cogent, Frontier, Fuse, DirecPC, RCN and Wide Open West. Paxfire would intercept a person’s search request at Bing and Yahoo and redirect it to another page. By skipping over the search service’s results, the participating ISPs would collect referral fees for delivering users to select websites. 

AT&T, SPRINT and VERIZON: From 2011–2013, AT&T, Sprint and Verizon blocked Google Wallet, a mobile-payment system that competed with a similar service called Isis, which all three companies had a stake in developing.

EUROPE: A 2012 report from the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications found that violations of Net Neutrality affected at least one in five users in Europe. The report found that blocked or slowed connections to services like VOIP, peer-to-peer technologies, gaming applications and email were commonplace. 

VERIZON: In 2012, the FCC caught Verizon Wireless blocking people from using tethering applications on their phones. Verizon had asked Google to remove 11 free tethering applications from the Android marketplace. These applications allowed users to circumvent Verizon’s $20 tethering fee and turn their smartphones into Wi-Fi hot spots. By blocking those applications, Verizon violated a Net Neutrality pledge it made to the FCC as a condition of the 2008 airwaves auction.

AT&T: In 2012, AT&T announced that it would disable the FaceTime video-calling app on its customers’ iPhones unless they subscribed to a more expensive text-and-voice plan. AT&T had one goal in mind: separating customers from more of their money by blocking alternatives to AT&T’s own products. 

VERIZON: During oral arguments in Verizon v. FCC in 2013, judges asked whether the phone giant would favor some preferred services, content or sites over others if the court overruled the agency’s existing open internet rules. Verizon counsel Helgi Walker had this to say: “I’m authorized to state from my client today that but for these rules we would be exploring those types of arrangements.” Walker’s admission might have gone unnoticed had she not repeated it on at least five separate occasions during arguments.

I'm glad you mention this. Net Neutrality isn't a proactive move, it's reactive due to the past behavior of the internet companies. Take a look:

MADISON RIVER: In 2005, North Carolina ISP Madison River Communications blocked the voice-over-internet protocol (VOIP) service Vonage. Vonage filed a complaint with the FCC after receiving a slew of customer complaints. The FCC stepped in to sanction Madison River and prevent further blocking, but it lacks the authority to stop this kind of abuse today.

COMCAST: In 2005, the nation’s largest ISP, Comcast, began secretly blocking peer-to-peer technologies that its customers were using over its network. Users of services like BitTorrent and Gnutella were unable to connect to these services. 2007 investigations from the Associated Press, the Electronic Frontier Foundation and others confirmed that Comcast was indeed blocking or slowing file-sharing applications without disclosing this fact to its customers.

TELUS: In 2005, Canada’s second-largest telecommunications company, Telus, began blocking access to a server that hosted a website supporting a labor strike against the company. Researchers at Harvard and the University of Toronto found that this action resulted in Telus blocking an additional 766 unrelated sites.

AT&T: From 2007–2009, AT&T forced Apple to block Skype and other competing VOIP phone services on the iPhone. The wireless provider wanted to prevent iPhone users from using any application that would allow them to make calls on such “over-the-top” voice services. The Google Voice app received similar treatment from carriers like AT&T when it came on the scene in 2009.

WINDSTREAM: In 2010, Windstream Communications, a DSL provider with more than 1 million customers at the time, copped to hijacking user-search queries made using the Google toolbar within Firefox. Users who believed they had set the browser to the search engine of their choice were redirected to Windstream’s own search portal and results.

MetroPCS: In 2011, MetroPCS, at the time one of the top-five U.S. wireless carriers, announced plans to block streaming video over its 4G network from all sources except YouTube. MetroPCS then threw its weight behind Verizon’s court challenge against the FCC’s 2010 open internet ruling, hoping that rejection of the agency’s authority would allow the company to continue its anti-consumer practices.

PAXFIRE: In 2011, the Electronic Frontier Foundation found that several small ISPs were redirecting search queries via the vendor Paxfire. The ISPs identified in the initial Electronic Frontier Foundation report included Cavalier, Cogent, Frontier, Fuse, DirecPC, RCN and Wide Open West. Paxfire would intercept a person’s search request at Bing and Yahoo and redirect it to another page. By skipping over the search service’s results, the participating ISPs would collect referral fees for delivering users to select websites.

AT&T, SPRINT and VERIZON: From 2011–2013, AT&T, Sprint and Verizon blocked Google Wallet, a mobile-payment system that competed with a similar service called Isis, which all three companies had a stake in developing.

EUROPE: A 2012 report from the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications found that violations of Net Neutrality affected at least one in five users in Europe. The report found that blocked or slowed connections to services like VOIP, peer-to-peer technologies, gaming applications and email were commonplace. 

VERIZON: In 2012, the FCC caught Verizon Wireless blocking people from using tethering applications on their phones. Verizon had asked Google to remove 11 free tethering applications from the Android marketplace. These applications allowed users to circumvent Verizon’s $20 tethering fee and turn their smartphones into Wi-Fi hot spots. By blocking those applications, Verizon violated a Net Neutrality pledge it made to the FCC as a condition of the 2008 airwaves auction.

AT&T: In 2012, AT&T announced that it would disable the FaceTime video-calling app on its customers’ iPhones unless they subscribed to a more expensive text-and-voice plan. AT&T had one goal in mind: separating customers from more of their money by blocking alternatives to AT&T’s own products. 

VERIZON: During oral arguments in Verizon v. FCC in 2013, judges asked whether the phone giant would favor some preferred services, content or sites over others if the court overruled the agency’s existing open internet rules. Verizon counsel Helgi Walker had this to say: “I’m authorized to state from my client today that but for these rules we would be exploring those types of arrangements.” Walker’s admission might have gone unnoticed had she not repeated it on at least five separate occasions during arguments.

The problem is that the ISP space isn't conducive to competition, thats what you fail to realize. There's a reason why most ISPs face little to no competition in the US, have the worst consumer satisfaction of any industry, and internet prices have actually risen in the past few decades. Its called infrastructure, and the massive amounts of it that are required to compete with any other ISP make it nearly impossible. Even GOOGLE with their absurdly deep pockets gave up trying to compete with the established players. Free market forces don't function properly in these kinds of spaces, which is the same as other spaces like utilities. You're not going to have 20 different companies all with their own independent water pipe network going into your home. Thats idiotic.

I disagree. What will really happen is a competitor to netflix will now face an increased barrier to entry. They won't have the same advantages that companies used to have. Now they have to somehow deal with the fact that netflix (or whatever the entrenched company is) has preferred status with ISP's and other companies across the network stack and they can't get the same treatment without massive capital, which they can't get. It chokes growth and will result in diminished growth of what the internet could be. We will all pay more and get less over time. They will do it gradually enough where people won't freak out until it's far too late. Data caps are coming.

"Yeah, I agree that regulation often is a giant barrier to entry. We can see that at work even within the Bitcoin economy - look at what the bitlicense did to many NY-based crypto businesses.

But regulation is often created to solve problems. For example, look at most typical devices with radios and you'll see stamped markings about how they conform to various regulations placed on radio interference. Without such regulations, corporations could deliberately interfere with their competitor's signals with impunity. Or it would permit poorly made equipment purchased by your neighbor to jam up your wifi signal entirely unintentionally. And regulation is probably necessary to deal with negative externalities and the tragedy of the commons.

But regulation is corruptible. You need a very well working system to maintain it and to resist the influence of special interest groups. That seems unrealistic. But perhaps less unrealistic that hoping that literally all regulation is simply abolished.

We do and thats a bad thing.

But we also have less regulations than USA in some kinds of connections, like internet by radio. We have a lot small local ISPs doing business by radio because of that - most of them even have the tech to do telephone by radio, but they're all waiting YEARS for the government autorization, LOL.

Almost anywhere you have more than 1 option of ISP because of that. Most urban areas have at least 3 options: one by telephone cable, one by TV cable, one by radio. And we are a huge and poor country! It baffles me when some of you guys complaint about having just 1 option. If an area here have only 1 carrier and its charging to much or delivering a bad service, I can just lay a big cable from the nearest competitor to a high ground, buy a big link wholesale, set up an antenna (or rent space in one) and cover the area with internet by radio. From under the price of an apartment I can have a local small ISP, I just need an antenna, a truck to do service, someone to help in field service and a network guy.";2;2;False;celtiberian666;dq7739j;Don't let the FCC destroy the net!

The brazilian bill that allowed judges to block whatsapp for a period of time (as some sort of punishment) is the same: a large and vague text, not written in an obective way, that leaves it all to interpreation.

This act is a huge mess of badly written vague definitions. Even the FCC said they're only enforcing parts of it. If they wanted they could do a lot of harm tomorrow. The way it is written just anything goes. Even a government-loving liberal like you should be in favor of getting rid of it right now in favor of a more concise piece that gives NO POWER for the government to mess with the internet. And not by the hands of an agency, but by law, including all protections for the private citizens against not only the carriers, but most importantly against any kind of government sniffing or control.

"The government has also granted a monopoly to cable and phone companies because it's not reasonable for every ISP to get an agreement to use all the individual pieces of property needed to deliver cable, phone, and internet service.

Title II under COMMUNICATIONS ACT OF 1934.

Read the Title II. It starts on page 34 of the 300-page regulation act (how the fuck 300 pages of retulations are needed is beyong me).

There are a lot of open holes for government intervention, like this one:

""The Commission may obtain from such carriers and from persons directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by, or under direct or indirect common control with, such carriers full and complete information necessary to enable the Commission to perform the duties and carry out the objects for which it was created.""

What constitute ""full and complete information""?

You are making a bold afirmation that just isn't true. You have not even read the regulation, inform yourself.

Copied from another redditor: ""It's a 1930s regulation that has nothing to do with net neutrality. It has 47 sections, but the FCC claims it will only apply 6 of those sections to broadband for now. They can change their interpretation and enforce all 47 sections at any moment. The net neutrality language that's enforced is ""All practices must be just and reasonable,"" where the FCC decides the definition of just and reasonable. The law is completely left up to interpretation.""

Thats a huge wide open door for the government to control the internet.
