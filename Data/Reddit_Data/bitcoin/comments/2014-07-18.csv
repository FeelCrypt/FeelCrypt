"Yes it is definitely an easy implementation.  I'm sure they actually did it in less than 3 days with the rest filled with testing, etc.  I think the important thing is that stating how easy it is to implement gives other businesses a boost of confidence in switching over as well.

I had an M15x a couple of computers ago when I was studying game development and it was top notch. People knock Alienware because you are paying a premium for the design over competitors with similar specs. In my experience it was well worth a couple hundred bucks especially when you are spending like $3k on a laptop. The thing was a tank, extremely well made compared to my classmates Asus ROGs and Toshiba Oosimos.

They're high quality, and have a lot of flashy lights and extra bells and whistles, but it's debatable whether the price premium is worth it. Especially for desktops.

"Ya, the price premium is a lot, but it is an incredibly well built system.  At least you know you are not buying something crap.  The way I look at it is it is like the Mac.  You can get an alternative well-built option cheaper, but if you buy it, it's not like you can go wrong with the device in that choice.  And, often people want the ""image"" of it too.  As a graduate student in a university, I can say that having a Mac is a massive image thing for girls right now, where it is almost a shame in some circles NOT to have one.  It is a status symbol of elite culture in a way.  Alienware is an image thing as well.  Some gamers want that image.  I can particulary say among the Chinese students at my university, which is like 50% of the entire graduate body here, tons of them have Alienware as it is considered a very prestigious laptop among them.  And you know what, having carried them, felt them, played with them, I can't deny they are impressive pieces of hardware.

">NO. Fail. Not convenient, expensive, time-consuming, shady, low-tech, weird.

No.  Just...no.  You're conflating the risk of dealing person-to-person with a flaw in the Bitcoin protocol?  So...you haven't heard of Bitcoin ATMs I take it?  I can walk up to a Bitcoin ATM and turn cash into Bitcoin.  Convenient, non-expensive, non-time-consuming, non-shady, high-tech and NOT weird, I might add. If you want to deal with a person to person transaction you can - and those risks are the same as buying or selling an item on Craigslist in person for cash.  Bitcoin has nothing to due with the ""shady, weird"" elements of personal dealings - those have been there since the beginning of time.

>merchant adoption is not driving consumer adoption

Considering 70% of people surveyed haven't heard of Bitcoin yet, I'm not too worried about consumer adoption being driven by merchant adoption.  Bitcoin is in its early stages.  The fact that so many merchants have come on board at this early time is actually a point counter to the one you're trying to make.  If merchants were concerned about low consumer adoption they wouldn't be accepting BTC in the first place.

">At what point do the anti-bitcoin naysayers finally start taking BTC seriously? I'm genuinely interested what the true tipping point of acceptance is.

I only use bitcoin when it offers a clear advantage over the current system in place. I would not bother using bitcoin on a normal ecommerce site, and I wouldn't use it to buy a dell. I'd stick with paypal, most likely. Why would I give up 120 days of consumer protection for no good reason? Especially when buying a dell. 

I've only actually purchased bitcoins and used them once, and that was to buy drugs online. 

In that transaction bitcoin demonstrated a unique and clear advantage and offered a feature that couldn't be offered by the traditional banking system/card network. 

Bitcoin needs a killer app if it ever wants to get me seriously using it. Simply playing catch up with paypal isn't a killer app. It's pretty much the bare minimum it should be managing. Even if Amazon started accepting it, I wouldn't care. It'd still not be bitcoins killer app.

">And what about when the man that created CNET releases bitreserve and allows you to keep your money denominated in USD or EUR and allows you to pay using Bitcoin? Or other similar companies and services using the Bitcoin network to facilitate a transfer?

The service doesn't exist yet, and the only service similar was Neo&Bee so I'm a little skeptical. Also, ask yourself this. How will those companies make money. They need to make money somewhere. 

At the moment sites like Coinbase and Bitpay are beating the market because they're operating in a regulatory grey area. That gives them a huge advantage because they don't have to bother with complying to regulations, which is generally a costly endeavor. What happens when bitcoin banks/exchanges are regulated like normal banks/exchanges? We'll likely see a price increase, and in all honesty I don't think using any kind of Bitcoin service will be cheaper than using the fiat equivalent.  

Most money is just bits on a hard drive and has been for over a decade. The Bitcoin technology isn't where the savings are coming from, it's that regulatory grey area that's the money spinner.

Yes, it is great.  I'm not denying that.  But it's nice to choose when to pay for the protection.  That 1%-3% back from credit cards comes from people using the *loan* services.  You ever see a debit card give cash back?  Nope.  The rewards points you get back from credit cards are a perk for using their credit service.  To just use their payment processing service, you can't get the same perks.  It's nice to have the option.

> and because you aren't liable for fraud.

Do you think Visa/MasterCard just pay for fraudulent charges out of the goodness of their heart?  No!  They charge a higher percentage than they lose to fraud.  You literally pay to cover fraud for other people.  It's like insurance.  Again, if you feel the need for it, then good for you.

">And no, all those bits on a hard drive are in no way comparable to cryptocurrency; you can copy them endlessly and they cannot be transferred. It's little wonder you're unable to appreciate the implications of the technology with such an erroneous understanding.

I understand the technology perfectly well. In a business sense, none of that matters at all. The banks have had ways of verifying funds since forever. A trustless system is only really beneficial when you have no idea who you're sending to. Banks can work on a trust system because they do billions upon billions of dollars worth of business with each other, and they don't want to kill the goose that's laying the golden egg. 

The reason I mentioned that it's all just bits on a hard drive is because I was trying to highlight that in simple terms the ability to transfer money between banks has been technologically frictionless for years now. Generally the biggest friction encountered is regulatory and differing standards. But banks have been spending billions in the past decade or so to get rid of all the differing standards and develop their own, which they hope all banks will accept. The stragglers, well, if they're not willing to integrate with the other banks then they're even less likely they'll attempt to integrate bitcoin. 

You could argue that Bitcoin is the standard they've been looking for, but the fact that many people who have nothing to do with the bank hold bitcoins and have influence in its function is a bad thing in the eyes of banks. They could get the exact same utility from just creating their own alt coin to use in their backend systems. There's absolutely no advantage to using bitcoin, though.

"> The only time people use irreversible payment methods for small vendors is in trustless situations (you're in front of me, the product is in between us, I pick it up and look at it, give you cash, we're both happy).

Both businesses and consumers use other electronic, irreversable payment types all of the time such as International Wire Transfer. The only catch is that people will only do this when they either 1> trust the recipient of the money at least as much as you'd trust a bank or payment processor such as paypal, or alternately 2> trust the web of consequence keeping them honest, such as ""they won't screw with me,  the consequences of losing my business / bad pr / getting sued would be too difficult for them to bear"".

Yes, it is important to establish nodes: be they banks, visa, paypal, escrow, and/or vendors trusted on a case by case basis that can be sufficiently trusted by the sender that you can put your payment in their hands and know they will protect your interests as the transaction proceeds. The problem with banks, visa, and paypal is that the entire payment network is limited to the escrow available. If you want Paypal in particular to safeguard your funds, the vendor has to participate in the Paypal payment network, etc.

It seems to me that this feature has been way oversold.  I don't regularly do business with people I don't trust, and so don't regularly need a chargeback feature.  T-Mobile, Walmart, Lowes, Kroger, Sonic, Burger King, McDonalds, Amazon, Newegg, Dominos, Shell, Dairy Queen, General Dollar, Whole Foods, Target, Cinemark, Chick-Fil-A, et all are legitimate and I've never had to get a third party involved to handle any dispute with any of these businesses, and I've had disputes with every single one (order was wrong, product was broken, never received, etc).

Yep

I disagree.  It adds the ability to easily transact over long distances peer to peer, which before bitcoin required paypal or western union, who took a much larger chunk than the tiny transaction fee that bitcoin costs.

Once people begin producing small things themselves, be it making money on youtube videos or selling crafts on etsy or art prints / commissions on DA or any item at all on Ebay or Craigslist then they begin to *inherit* all of the same merchant-suck that Paypal and the credit card payment network have traditionally saddled larger businesses with.

Bitcoin is push-based and irreversible, but it is only the foundation of a greater variety of payment solutions.

"Realistically, though, the savings won't be the 10% we're seeing at Newegg and Dell. That's entirely a marketing ploy and no way the cost of doing business with credit cards. 

For example, Dell has paypal as an option. A bit retailer like Dell will be getting custom rates from paypal likely no more than 1.5% + 30 cents given the volume they do. 

The reason we're seeing 10% is because, essentially, it's a marketing tactic. It's like giving 10% discount to war vets or something. 

So in a bitcoin everywhere world, we might see a decrease of 2-5%, maybe. The bigger the retailer, the less of a price decrease. 

Yeah, that's might sway me with bigger retailers like Amazon/Dell/Etc. But no name little ecommerce sites (which I use quite often to find the cheapest product) I wouldn't touch with a barge pole. I only use them now because I know that if they don't deliver my item, I can whine to paypal and get them to refund me.

True

> This is not an advantage for consumers - in fact, it's a disadvantage.

Depends on how you look at it.  I trust Dell and Newegg because I have previously done business with them and recognize their brand.  I wouldn't hesitate to pay cash at a Newegg or Dell outlet with every expectation of being able to return my products should they break.  In fact, most large stores offer return policies that are legitimate, and the only time I can foresee using chargebacks is with shady businesses and unknown individuals, in which case I'd prefer to use credit or some other escrow to protect my funds in case of scammers.

Bitcoin gives us the choice.  Over time, that choice should pan out to mean more savings for those of us willing to trust the merchant.
