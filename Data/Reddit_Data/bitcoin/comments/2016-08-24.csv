"> I think a major roadblock in the way of bitcoin getting mass acceptance is from the community itself. We struggle to try and see the use of bitcoin out of our own frame of reference.

Thank you for making your arguments clear. As much as I disagree with them in the detail, your  analysis is just as valid as any.

Blockchains are certainly a new way of handling things that previously required lawyers and paperwork because they can be immutable proof of transactions (ie ownership)


Whether they are public or private, they have the quality of being immutable, which is a huge advantage over the current systems where audit trails can be obfuscated according to the whim of the vendor/client.


Whether Bitcoin survives as a global currency is indeed up to the users and the use cases are way too rare for BTC to have a claim to being the future of money, but one thing is very clear about BTC. You are your own bank. It may take a few generations of debate and financial warfare, but BTC does prove the point that anyone can be their own bank.

I would detest a world where the Fed (rothschild) or any other central bank (also rothschild) got to run the economy on a private blockchain. That's the real battle - take these people out of the money system and the world is a better place. Decentralize everything because the tech can deliver all the security and people just have to learn to accept responsibility again
