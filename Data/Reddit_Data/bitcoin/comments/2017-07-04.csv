A revised Rule 41 would allow the FBI to use a single warrant to hack an indefinite number of computers anywhere in the world. To hack a computer today, the FBI requires a warrant issued by a court with jurisdiction over the location of the targeted machine. After December 1, the FBI can quietly get a warrant from any federal judge and hack not merely a single computer but all computers connected to it…and so on and so on.In theory, a single warrant issued anywhere in America would allow the FBI to control millions of computers on a botnet whether or not they were located in the United States.Tor and its equivalents are a prime target, as evidenced by the recent shut-down of KickassTorrents and the arrest of its owner Artem Vaulin. (Although the arrest occurred in the Poland, it was driven by a complaint filed in the District Court in Chicago, and Vaulin is being extradited to the U.S.).The change to Rule 41 is designed to attack Tor through its user base. To justify the single warrant required for mass surveillance, the FBI merely needs to show that someone tried to cloak his computer’s location. The FBI could then pursue the user and all of his computer connections.

"Yes a bit of inflation is the price you pay to use the global financial system that is tethered to the dollar. A conservative liquid asset allocation will beat out inflation generating real return on USD holdings over a cycle.

The federal reserve purchases debt it doesn’t sell it. And yes fractional reserve banking and treasury issuance is how we expand the monetary system to keep up with the economy. It’s a lot smarter than tying your economy to how fast you can dig up gold or a program some anonymous guy programmed and owns 10% of.

Many states have made very unwise promises to unions. There are hard decisions that need to be made but none of these are the end of the world.

The banking system is far more safe than it was a decade ago. And no I don’t think it’s unusual that the US had a recession and is no longer in a recession. It’s called the business/credit cycle. The US has been the largest economy for 100 years. It would be very unusual if a recession changed that. Private sector debt has fallen over the past ten years; don’t often hear the chicken littles talk about that. Public sector debt is private sector assets; it will probably be paid by the wealthy and be partially inflated away. Anyway, the Japanese enjoy very high HDI despite very large public debt load; it’s not disastrous for a developed country.

By most traditional metrics the US economy is very strong. Highest GDP in global history, low unemployment, good consumer confidence, 6+ straight years of growth.

"This is good fun. Let's see if we can have a civil conversation. No name calling!

>The dollar is a good store of value. You know why? Because if you're an American and you don't use it you go to prison. Try paying your taxes in Bitcoin if you dont believe me. That's a perpetual source of massive demand.

So your primary argument for the dollar's store-of-value is government coersion? Even an unfathomable degree of sustained coersion (through tacit threat of violence) to keep the dollar's status as the Global Reserve Currency will not prevent the inflation we see every year. What is inflation, if not the devaluation of existing currency? In my opinion, inflation is mimicry of economic growth. Beyond the debt sold to the taxpayers by the Federal Reserve, fractional reserve banking and treasury bonds are commonly abused mechanisms through which ""money"" is created.

>The US economy is incredibly strong and the US banking system is the safest it has ever been. Many large tech companies are significantly undervalued (Google for one).
> Illinois, New Jersey, and Kentucky will have to restructure their budgets, not the end of the world. 

The jig is up in Illinois, where the state's credit rating is going to hell. Oops! No one wants Illinois Bonds anymore, no more ""money-making"" for them. They may be the first domino to fall. Don't fool yourself into thinking that somehow Illinois' economy isn't tethered to other states in the Union.

>You should effectively forget 2008 ever happened because it was a once in 75 year credit supercycle event and living in fear of it happening again will screw up your brain.

The same practices that lead our economy into the 2008 crash are still practised today. Bring back glass-steagall! Repeal Citizen's United! Don't you think it is unusual that the US economy is suddenly ""back on top"" less than a decade after the crisis? The underlying chronic problems with monetary policy and the banking sector still reek yet the noisiest people in the room are touting a 20k+ DOW without asking, ""why?"" Don't mention the staggeringly rapid rate at which US debt exploded. Doubled in less than a decade! Doubled! Who is going to pay this debt? When? How?

>And a good laugh at Bitcoin people scared of wage gaps. Most of them are dreaming of being new age Rockefellers for the great societal contribition of buying btc/eth from the comfort of their computer chair.

I suppose the context is humorous. So is this comment coming from a guy who think the US economy is ""incredibly strong."" Perhaps by the ""US economy"" you meant the ""Ultra-rich."" You must not be poor if you don't see the irony here. Good for you

"**What government get if they constrain bitcoin?**

They can keep extracting wealth from its citizens by printing more FIAT.
They can keep extracting wealth from its citizens by controlling money flow and taking (overblown) taxes.

**What government lose if they constrain bitcoin?**

It's citizens will miss on buying new global asset when it is cheap and that will basically destroy that country economically in the world where bitcoin is becoming more and more popular. For example when Bolivians finally starts to buy bitcoins in couple of years they will have to pay $10.000, $15.000, $20.000 for something that rest of the world buys now for $3000 (not to mention that smartest/luckiest bought it for way less). That would be financial suicide for Bolivia.
Since governments are not stupid, there is only couple of governments in the world that are really banning bitcoin and other cryptos.

**Why would Average Joe wanted to deal with Bitcoin?**

Because bitcoins will not lose value over time. It only makes sense to keep any savings in a currency that losses as little value as possible over time. Citizens who lives in countries with good currencies with low inflations like EUR/USD don't really understand this ATM, however rest of the world only keeps pocket money (like one month salary) in domestic currency and all savings in better currencies like USD/EUR. Citizens of those less fortunate countries often do business directly with better currency if able and even price things in better currency with disclaimer ""paid with local (shitty) currency with exchange rate at the time of buying"". Anyways, if bitcoin becomes stable and widely used he will have smaller inflation (even negative inflation) then any FIAT currency and therefor become default choice for any savings everywhere. Not to mention that it is permissionless, borderless, and all other good things. Problem is that citizens of countries with shitty currencies are not early technology adopters. It just takes a bit more time for them to get infrastructure and right mind set. As someone said the other day: ""For Bitcoin to win it just needs to survives a bit longer.""";6;0;False;Rdzavi;djqxq3j;South Korea is Preparing to Regulate and Legalize Bitcoin;6kzmhp;https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/south-korea-preparing-legalize-bitcoin/

The US economy is incredibly strong and the US banking system is the safest it has ever been. Many large tech companies are significantly undervalued (Google for one).

You should effectively forget 2008 ever happened because it was a once in 75 year credit supercycle event and living in fear of it happening again will screw up your brain.

"If Fiat currencies were to fall I don't see how crypto currencies could possibly hold there value. I mean my first thought goes to the reliability of the internet, just how long would the internet stay up and running without companies paying employees in Fiat currency?



If the internet were to go down then cryptos wouldn't hold any value, would they?


This is just me thinking out loud.



Also we have all seen what the recent price hikes have done to the Bitcoin network lately. Just imagine the time TXS would take if something drastic happened like a major countries Fiat falling. I would think the network would be unusable, or the fees would rise so high no one could afford using it.



You have to realize that if Fiat falls then all the folks saying they would be using Bitcoin would go from saving there BTC to using it for day to day TXS. Just imagine all the extra TXS that would add a day.
