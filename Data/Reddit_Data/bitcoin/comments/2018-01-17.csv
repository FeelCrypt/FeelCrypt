Their chart tells quite a story.

For the curious, it was a very odd coin in which you would stake a amount of currency for a fixed period of time and they would guarantee returns of around 240%. You could not pull your coins out earlier for they would be used to fund a trading bot which would buy and sell cryptocurrencies to make that guaranteed Roi. Suspiciously no information at all about the training Bots was made available not even a history of past trade or performance.

But wait, there's more! The coin further added a complexity of a tiered referral system just like a multi-level marketing scheme.

"The thing is that cryptoassets are neither true currencies, commodities, or true capital investments.  They have properties of all three fall on a spectrum with all three.

You argue that someone can create a new cryptocurrency like bitcoin, but with slightly different parameters, and that's true.  But the value from bitcoin doesn't MERELY come from the code itself.  It comes from the fact that it's already become an accepted store of value by millions of people.  You can try convincing people that your new currency is better, and the principles of economics will apply to which one outcompetes, but BTC will have first market advantage.  Another cryptocurrency is going to have to innovate and find other uses for the technology to overtake Bitcoin.  And that's exactly what altcoin projects are trying to do - they see value in the technology, *and flaws* in the technology.  And they're working to innovate and improve on something that is already seen by many as a successful innovation on our current monetary system.

Now, it seems like you PERSONALLY, don't see the innovations of a decentralized public ledger attached to a currency as anything significant.  That's your evaluation of it and that's fine.

EDIT: I’ve talked to people at work about bitcoin and fielded some basic questions and provided coworkers with links to Andreas videos and the most objective articles that I have come across in my own research. I always try to say that they should do their own research and not to gamble with more than they are willing to lose. I also try to warn them that most coins are scams. I’ve warned a few people that bitconnect is a scam and have gotten the cold shoulder. Still, I would feel like shit if they lost money after I introduced them to crypto even with the disclaimers.

"What if I thought I knew how bitcoin worked and that motivated me to invest, but upon learning about the transaction problems I became more hesitant but still held because I was convinced some country would index their currency to it and banks would latch on to it as a store of value driving the price up even higher eventually?

I bought all the way along the way from 7500 to 17500, and reluctantly sold just below 14k in an upward blip during the downward trend.  I don't regret selling except that I'm worried about my MIA funds in limbo due to Coinbase's transaction backlog.  I guess I should've sold higher, but I still almost doubled my initial money in under two months so I don't feel bad.  

Now I understand it more than I did before and I'm more hesitant to buy back in because I don't think that *anyone* fully comprehends what's going to happen with transaction costs.  I think the problem will be solved when cryptocurrency credit cards or the equivalent (batching transactions through a trusted aggregator) become mainstream but not until some company or software gets the kind of relative clout that Visa and Amex currently hold.

That is because bitcoin (along with the other crypto currencies) has no intrinsic value to base a valuation on. Stocks have the value of the company (ability go generate revenue as well as their holdings) commodities have industrial uses. Bitcoin on the other hand is useful for nothing except for trading. That may seem alright if you consider Bitcoin to actually be a currency, but due to the high volatility, transaction fees, and slow transactions it is completely unsuitable as a currency. It also has a theoretical max number of coins, which means that in the long run it is deflationary, which is not a good thing for its status as a currency.

Look at this loser, he's being a responsible adult and not buying into a super risky investment that could vanish into nothing before I even finish typing this sentence. Lets all point at him and laugh. 

To be clear that is all sarcasm, anyone who criticizes you for paying down your mortgage is probably not someone you want giving you advice. I think there's an argument to be made for investing if you believe you can get a better interest rate on the investment than your mortgage, which isn't too hard if you got your mortgage loan within the past 15 years; looking back it appears that in the 80s rates were 15+%, so paying the loan off might have been the better choice in the long run.

luckily I work with a bunch of very smart people so he wasn't able to convince anyone to join him, and he only put about a hundred dollars in.

he asked me if I wanted to invest, I told him I'd loan him twenty bucks, and if he made profit on it he could keep it, otherwise he could just repay me the twenty when he was ready.  he pinned that date on his calender and so far he's just glad he doesn't owe me twenty bucks.

"**yep, absolutely**! 

so long as Bitcoin doesn't have a fatal flaw it's useful as a currency and programmable money and it has arguably the most talent behind it _and_ withstood the most attacks.  Plus at $5 with the fees where they are now, that's back down to a penny per transaction.

Bitcoin is a venn diagram between a lot of things, and the investment part isn't all of it.  I'm here for that part, but I'm also here for the part where I can send money to anyone at any time according to rules I set _without anyone's permission_, plus the financial rules behind Bitcoin are favorable.

People give that one guy shit for spending 10,000 bitcoins for a pizza but they forget he paid someone _on the other side of the world_ with basically zero (or actually zero, not sure which) fees within 10 minutes.

"Excellent points. I would like to add that although you have constant inflation, it is not guaranteed. Just like there is risk of a cryptocurrency crashing, you have a risk in a fiat system crashing. As happened in Zimbabwe, Venezuela, Greece etc. So the lesson is to diversify your assets/investments.

As technology and adoption grows, so will the transaction speed, price stability and transaction affordability for the crypto. Daily trade volume for Bitcoin is less than $5 million USD equivalent, while USD is in the trillions.

"Bitcoin has most definitely been in a bubble since the underlying technology became unusable for its purpose (as an instant, worldwide, cheap alternative to banks) in late-2017. Before that, there had been a high sentiment for Bitcoin, based on its 5-to-10-year demand expectations. But that priced-in sentiment was gone when BTC's fees skyrocketed and TXs started taking days or weeks instead of hours. The technology didn't appear to be heading to anywhere near it's goal short-term. Que shattering glass, unless Lightning or some clever BIP comes along.

In my opinion, Bitcoin should have had a price correction then, but it seemed like the ""Blockchain Craze"" had already taken hold and instead BTC value has gone up in a rally that most of us have not seen anywhere since .com. Anything related to blockchain has gone up. Like Kodak's or Long Blockchain's stock. That is what some people now call a ""proof of stupidity"" market tendency. And Bitcoin was on top of it all. Still doesn't sound like a bubble?

I'm not one of the people who would laugh at you at the office for investing in Bitcoin, even ""buying the dip"" in an early stage of this price correction. I myself had a limited exposure to BTC. I've lost money. I'm also not one of the people who would laugh at you in the office, because cryptos have allowed me to finally commit to trading full time. And I don't have to sit around in an office and laugh at things I don't understand.

Bubbles and busts is what cryptos are made of. And other investors will lose money for you to make some. That doesn't make any investment intrinsically bad or a pyramid scheme, much more than trading in any market, even a supermarket - you can bet your ass some child died in sweatshop conditions to put that Nike shoe in a discount bin. Many of us wouldn't have signed up for this if we weren't ready to deal with the risk.

I think I read an article that countered that but I can't find. Assuming you're correct, I'd argue the distribution will be much better down the line. Additionally, the bitcoin rich are not in control of the money supply. Miners take this role and if they choose rules users don't like, then they will kill their golden goose. Miners and full nodes also enforce our consensus rules, again not the rich. Lastly, I'm OK with all these bitcoin millionaires. They took a risky and smart bet and won.

"That's is indeed one way to look at it.  The way I see it, USD does have value for the reasons you tell yourself, but those reasons are grounded in a consensus perception.  The perceptions I refer to are the existence of social contracts, like the U.S. government, and tax laws.  You live your life like these are real tangible things that exist because that's what we've are taught and thinking like this allows us to understand the rules of society more simply.  In reality they are complex social contracts between each individual and the individuals that live in the approximate vicinity.  They have evolved over hundreds of years to the point that it's easier to believe they exist OUTSIDE of people that that they merely exist INSIDE our collective consciousnesses.  

You can try to imagine what it would look like to a being coming across what we call a ""society"" for the first time: 350million+ Americans have reached a formal agreement about a whole set of social rules (laws), the rulemaking process (government), the process for remaking the rulemaking process (constitutions), etc.  To the point that we agree to collectively hire various sets of people (militaries, police) to enforce these sets of rules with the threat of violence.  Sure it centralizes power in certain people.  Sure it is self-reinforcing through economics and education systems.  But it's not something that exists outside of human perception and consensus.

Understanding the ways we interact with one another on a basic and theoretical level is start for the idea that we can create perceived systems of consensus that operate on a principle of keeping power and/or resources *decentralized*";2;1;False;gsabram;dsswd3u;possibly the worst thing about this crash...;7qvjuv;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7qvjuv/possibly_the_worst_thing_about_this_crash/

Or.... It is a bubble because it doesnt have tangible long term advantages over other cryptos, and its price was inflated solely on hype.  When the price of an asset doesnt reflect the value of the asset to the extreme you get a bubble.

Most things hold value because of *perceived* scarcity, not actual scarcity.  We are told the value of something by others who are part of our social contract.  Since we live by the rules of the contract and act under them, we assume the rules and values that we're told hold true.  You don't buy gold bullion at $1300 an ounce because it's already cost you $1300 to mine an ounce of gold, you buy it at that price because others have told you that's what it *would* cost at the scales it's currently being mined and you believe them because you understand how markets work.  The only things that derive value from actual scarcity are the things that you continuously require in order to continue existing (food, water, etc.);1;0;False;gsabram;dssxht0;possibly the worst thing about this crash...;7qvjuv;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7qvjuv/possibly_the_worst_thing_about_this_crash/

A larger percentage of the population owning bitcoin is adoption. It's adoption of the store of value use case. The market is also much more liquid than it was just last year. Bitcoin as a currency is a future use case. A second-layer scaling solution like the Lightning Network allows users to make instantaneous and nearly free transactions. Some people are using it already, although it's still being tested.

"I have valid rebuttals to every one of those.

>* First: I talked about following the talent.  That throws Vertcoin right out. (:

I said ""like"" it, bc it is an example of an alternative that doesn't rely on asic mining that continues to waste more and more energy. It also puts the power in the hands of those with regular computers, instead of the rich buying a bunch of specialized hardware and cutting everyone else out.

>* Second: It doesn't matter what arbitrary block time a coin has

Yes it does, that is not arbitrary. Would you buy a cup of coffee and have to wait 10 minutes before they serve it to you? Of course not. And the solutions are just band-aids to that problem.

>  This sounds ridiculous, but eventually, blocks will probably have to grow as we approach the limits of what neat math tricks can do.

Because it is ridiculous. You're trying to justify a flawed system.

> it gives people with less processing power and slower connections a chance to participate.    

Many other coins, vtc included, make it much easier to be participate without having to meet such high standards already.

>* Third: _wasting energy_? I've seen this come up a lot and it shows a bit of a lack of understanding on your part. 
    
Lol! That's like me saying v12 cars are the most practical, because they make a lot of power without even having to be efficient. Umm, why wouldn't you want a turbo v6 thst gets better mileage, handles better, is cheaper to produce, uses less materials and has quicker response?

>Bitcoin uses that power as the basis for its security.

Right, it needs to waste an exponential amountof power to work and wherever the chealest energy is is where the most miners would go to. Even if that helps solar adoption, it's still wasting the energy that wouldn't be needed with PoS.

 It should be out of the reach of some countries.  It should be out of the reach of some **combinations** of countries.

Have you not already heard of how China and other eastern countries already have the majority of miners?

>* Fourth: _destroying the planet_? This is a fun one. So if one things that energy is wasted, they're apt to believe that all those Joules, sometimes generated by less clean power sources, will harm our planet. 

Yes, they do harm the planet by expending unneeded energy that could be used better elsewhere.

> [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T0OUIW89II) is my response, but in short: Bitcoin mining can subsidize _clean_ energy and allow return on investments quicker.

Another analogy would be good for this one. That's like saying someone killing millions of people helps to ""subsidize"" a better humanity because now there's less mouths to feed and there may be a more moral group of people created to help combat that mass murderer. The ends don't justify the means. Just bc it drives us to find a solution to 1 problem it created doesn't mean we should keep letting that problem continue, instead of eliminating the problem itself with a solution that doesn't require that mass amount of energy.

>* Fifth: compare Bitcoin to other stores of value and the amount of energy and effort required to maintain them.  The USD requires ""the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government"" which means the military, the bureaucracy, the billions of actual bills printed on actual material distributed by actual trucks, boats and planes virtually every one of which burns petroleum as fuel.  So yeah, I'll take the one that can be solar powered in the desert, please.

Nobody is arguing that the current system of USD is better, or else why would cryptocurrency have any use in the first place? Now compare that to the system that can be powered in everyone's home with their computer that's already running and doesn't require a solar farm...

Companies issue stocks as a means of gathering investment capital. Investment capital created expansion and improvement which increases return and value. Workers can not generate value on their own without capital and they certainly can't increase it without it.

"Yes but it only has value because enough people agree that it does. The utility of money is that it is an effective exchange of goods and services. Without the agreed upon value, money is useless. 

Bitcoin is bought and sold on an open market. It’s price reflects its agreed upon value. The big difference is that bitcoin is an upgraded iteration of storing value. It is a deflationary digital protocol backed by mathematics. Money (aka fiat currency) is inflationary and vulnerable to the actions of temporary political leaders and greedy financial institutions (ie. the creation or printing of more money).

If you don’t mind that banks hold our money, leverage it to make untold sums of money and then refuse to share those rewards with the people whose money was leveraged... then keep aggrandizing the same financial institutions that crashed the world economy.

Precisely. Value now has a different definition however. That is, the dollar has value because the U.S. population trusts it as a currency. Why? Well, because we've all grown up knowing that the dollar can buy goods and services and furthermore is backed by the U.S government should people start to lose faith in it. Bitcoin has the same value, in that it can be used as a currency, but the why is different. People don't trust a government to back it, instead they trust the mathematics and code that govern the Bitcoin network.

"And last year's dip was earlier than this. 

I didnt make this image but check it out (https://i.imgur.com/xKFssKT.jpg)

I verified the timings of the dips on coinmarketcap.com (but you can do it too if you want)

I think the big thing that people don't understand is that while many people do buy bitcoin as a tool for speculation, there are just as many people who are buying bitcoin to keep their hard earned money away from outside parties (govt, family, spouse,etc) and because bitcoin isn't usable to purchase things, they need to exchange it for fiat that they can use to purchase things. 

This years drop seems rather significant but its largely a combination of factors which have built up so much momentum. weak hands (in small part to crypto's popularity, bitconnect scam), tax law changes, lunar new year, etc  which is why we are seeing such a substantial dip. 

That being said, I did not sell (Should have, although jumping through the hoops to deal with taxes is just more trouble than its worth) but I am (and you should too) take the opportunity to increase your holdings in your favorite coins these next couple of weeks.

"No worries. I was in your shoes a few years ago and this tech is a big rabbit hole. If you want to think of the price, than yes it acts like a stock market in that prices go up and down. But it really is not a stock market. You're 'share' of bitcoin is similar to your 'share' in the U.S. Fed when you have a couple dollars in your wallet. Why does the function work? Well, to make a long story short: math. Math and economics lie at the heart of the Bitcoin network. The math secures each bitcoin as well as proves to everyone on the network that A) this person has X amount in bitcoin and b) this person can spend X amount in Bitcoin. If you try to spend more than you have, the network knows. If you try to send the same bitcoin to two different people, the network knows. Furthermore, bare with me, math also keep the network running. Every ten minutes, a group of transactions are confirmed as valid by supercomputers spread across the world. These super computers compete against each other to be able to say ""I, supercomputer A, approve all these transactions and have verified they have been sent to a person by a person"". If the super computers all agree that that computer was the first to confirm these transactions, then the network rewards them with a certain amount of bitcoin as well as all fees included in each transaction they verified. Thus, there will always be an incentive for large mining(these super computers are known as miners) companies to invest in computers that will compete for this reward. As the price in bitcoin goes higher, so too does that reward.";3;1;False;ILIKEWHATUGOT;dsspd8w;possibly the worst thing about this crash...;7qvjuv;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7qvjuv/possibly_the_worst_thing_about_this_crash/

"A tiny market? Have you seen the proposed value of all the crypto available right now? It's bigger than Apple. Sometimes you need to step outside of your immediate circle to get a fresh perspective. You're thinking about it purely as a medium of exchange, in which case you're right, it's hardly got a market share at all. But its primary use right now is as a 'hodl' investment, ie, it's being bought purely because it increases in value. When that use case dries up, people panic. Did you buy your coins purely so you can exchange value for things easily and without government interference ? Or did you get them because you expect they will rise in value? Which of those two camps do you think most people fall into?

For the argument that crypto replaces fiat, for that to be so, it needs to stabilise in value of it's impossible for it to become a useful medium of exchange. Absent that single utility, what is it for?

Perhaps the best argument I can think of is, it's a long term storage of value. Which is fine. We may get to a point where bitcoin becomes like the Amazon S3 of value, at which point it's price will stabilise. But with all the competition it faces, there's no reason to think that any of 'it' will continue to increase in value, because guess what, despite their being a BTC cap, there's an endless supply of blockchain space. The cap is arbitrary, and any slack will be taken up with cheaper competition.

"Yeah, but none of the highest market cap stocks are going to lose that unless there is a market wide correction, and there's no ""high flyer"" crypto than bitcoin. What you just said would be like you predicting Apple is going to be $90 in a month. That's just not going to happen without some serious market wide action. I can make the same exact comparison right now where the majority of cryptos just lost 15-20% of their value in a day. Do you have any idea what kind of mass panic would occur if the total stock market lost that? It looks like from this site the DJIA has only once lost more than 15% in a day (-22.61% in 1987): http://www.wsj.com/mdc/public/page/2_3024-djia_alltime.html  
  
You absolutely are allowed to compare cryptos to stocks. Right now they are both more or less investment vehicles.

"When people started saying that everybody was going to be buying their groceries online back in the 90's, it was really premature. Companies started up to do nothing but sell socks, or pet food (""We'll be the Amazon of marshmallows!""). Any company that started up with a rough idea got money thrown at them. But the infrastructure wasn't there. The Internet wasn't ready, payment systems weren't ready, delivery companies were too small and too slow, tech companies didn't have the capital. The whole thing flamed out spectacularly in the dot-com bubble, and naysayers laughed at how foolish all those futurists and techies had been to imagine that the Internet would change our fundamental way of life, and at the time, they seemed to have the weight of history behind them.

The implication I'm making is: Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are currently in the ""red-hot hype with little real-world application"" phase. Some people see amazing potential, others laugh at the whole idea, but it's kind of undeniable that the hype has far exceeded the real, current utility. We're going to continue to see cycles of hype and despair, but in the long run...well, you can decide where you think it's going to end up.

How can you compare it to Apple or Amazon? Those are actual companies that have real, tangible value. People don't buy/sell in iPhones and iPads, bitcoin is supposed to be a currency, and its market cap is very low and value is very volatile. Nevertheless, I am investing in it because I see an opportunity to make money off its erratic rollercoaster of a market value. To those that think bitcoin is a long term hold, I wish you the best of luck, but just as its value can rocket from $5k to $15k in a month for no reason other than market hype, its value can plummet from $15k to $5k for those very same reasons.;2;1;False;babsa90;dssjepm;possibly the worst thing about this crash...;7qvjuv;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7qvjuv/possibly_the_worst_thing_about_this_crash/
Cryptocurrencies are a tiny market. Don't let yourself get fooled by thinking that the market cap is a useful indicator to gauge the size of cryptocurrencies compared to companies. It's just useful to rank cryptocurrencies. It makes very little sense to multiply the current price by the number of available tokens since only a tiny fraction of those tokens are worth anywhere close to the current price. If you want to estimate the size of bitcoin, ask 100 people in the developed world to talk to you about bitcoin. You'll realize that most of them don't have a clue. The biggest exchange only has 13 million accounts and it accounts for 58% of all bitcoin transactions. We're talking about an international product that doesn't even have 100 million users. Cryptocurrency remains a tiny market and everyone is an early adopter at this point.;6;2;False;Exotemporal;dssmkgw;possibly the worst thing about this crash...;7qvjuv;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7qvjuv/possibly_the_worst_thing_about_this_crash/

"So a couple things.

* First: I talked about following the talent.  That throws Vertcoin right out. (:
* Second: It doesn't matter what arbitrary block time a coin has, it's up against the speed of light and coins with 1 minute block times, at some point in the future could run up against high orphan rates simply because the whole network collectively doesn't have the bandwidth to propagate the whole block in 1 minute.  This sounds ridiculous, but eventually, blocks will probably have to grow as we approach the limits of what neat math tricks can do.  I think 10 minutes is a good block time because it gives people with less processing power and slower connections a chance to participate.  I want to see more nodes in space, I want to see more nodes in remote areas of the world and with short blocktimes, you effectively reduce those node's power. High block times are directly addressed by second layer solutions such as LN and sidechains.
* Third: _wasting energy_? I've seen this come up a lot and it shows a bit of a lack of understanding on your part.  Bitcoin uses that power as the basis for its security.  The total hash rate (and by extension, the Joules poured into it) is the bar that needs to be surpassed in order to attack the network.  It serves a **vital** purpose, and every user of Bitcoin has an incentive to make that bar as high as possible.  It should be out of the reach of some countries.  It should be out of the reach of some **combinations** of countries.  I don't want Mexico to suddenly decide they want Bitcoin to fail, buy/manufacture a bunch of miners and attack the network successfully.
* Fourth: _destroying the planet_? This is a fun one. So if one things that energy is wasted, they're apt to believe that all those Joules, sometimes generated by less clean power sources, will harm our planet.  [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T0OUIW89II) is my response, but in short: Bitcoin mining can subsidize _clean_ energy and allow return on investments quicker.  In addition, _because_ of those block times it's possible to find the cheapest energy for mining in remote areas, which are _always renewables_ because after the infrastructure is built, you pay zero for fuel.  So like Andreas mentioned, in a way Bitcoin mining is subsidizing clean energy.
* Fifth: compare Bitcoin to other stores of value and the amount of energy and effort required to maintain them.  The USD requires ""the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government"" which means the military, the bureaucracy, the billions of actual bills printed on actual material distributed by actual trucks, boats and planes virtually every one of which burns petroleum as fuel.

"I think almost anyone invested in the cryptos at any amount can unfortunately relate with you, homie :(

I have a very close friend who I had talked to about BTC when it was 500/coin in Januaryish last year. He had just gotten a bonus, and was clean and could finally invest money instead of blowing it on dope, and he was really excited about buying 1BTC and putting the rest of the bonus into an IRA.

Well, another one of our close friends got wind of this and relentlessly tormented him with passively aggressive bs about ""suckers who buy bitcoin"". This other guy is a great person, really, but tbh hes a trust-fundifarian, has blown tons of cash that was just given to him, and is not at all any good at investing.

He successfully talked the first guy out of buying BTC.  One year later he finally stopped giving af, but his 500$ only affords him .04BTC lol

Crypto is designed to not allow the government to do this. So it's just a matter of time before government came down on it.

"Funny.  And glad you shared.  I just finished reading an article in a major news publication and then read the comments re that article. 

Oh my.  

I have received push back for months on end within various quarters of cryptoland for advocating for content that explains in simple words, simple sentences, short paragraphs and with benefits explained in a meaningful way to the average Joe and Jill.  What you are saying further underscores what I have been advocating.  

There is a HUGE disconnect among ""normies"" re their understanding of all things crypto that troubles me. 

Why is this important?  Because those with legislative power respond when millions of their constituents rise up in support of something being squashed or highly restricted. Without that active and loud support, those with power can exercise it in a manner that crypto supporters, a number still slim, may find upsetting.  

I'm a former PR agency head and faculty member who has lived long enough to evolve from that into front-end dev, managing my own local server, and learning/tinkering with code anytime I have the opp.  

What I know is that you most certainly can lure people into reading content dealing with this highly technical arena if it does not read like a scholarly article and answers the reader's question of ""what's in this for me""...why should I trade my time to read this? 

I remember long ago dealing with this very issue in the sciences at a university, where I wanted to write about advances in monoclonal antibodies.  After a considerable amount of persuasion, scientists finally began working with me to popularize their research.  The result?  Donations increased.  Why? Because people ""got it.""

After today's crash i have realised a majority of the people investing in cryptos are trying to get rich and are not involved because they believe in the technology. 

So my question is. How are most cryptos anything other than pure speculation? 

Things like bitcoin(store of wealth), Etherum/Eos(Dapp) actually have legit purposes but what about the currency transfer ones such as Dash/litecoin ect. How does the price of those cryptos have anything to do me sending money to someone around the world? I could still do it if dash was worth $1 each?

I'm quite heavily invested in this market and I'm still holding because I can see a bright future in some cryptos but I'm honestly questioning myself about a lot of the ones I have money in. 

Can anyone explain to me in detail how most of these cryptos are worth the money people are paying for them? I understand some cryptos will burn their coins away as they're using meaning over time the supply will decrease which will increase the price but other than that I don't see how they're anything other than speculation. 

I really hope someone can at least link me a site with a good explanation.

I honestly did not understand why it was going up so quick. Then stories of people taking out loans/mortgaging to buy bitcoin came out.

There you go. The media kept talking about how bitcoin had broken 5k again and had now broken 7500 and then 10k. Add to that the delay in actually getting set up to buy btc, or to take out loans for it, etc, and we got a true bull run. 10-15k in no time. Then it went to 19k. Too much gains in too short a time. Any cautious investor speculating with a small portion of their portfolio would sell at this point. Any jackass who didn't know anything about bitcoin but heard McAfee said $1m in 2 years all of a sudden became convinced and bought at 19k.

Very humorous, but to answer your question, the reason it is annoying you so much is because you care what other people think, and if what they believe goes against what you believe, it can actually feel like you are being murdered a little bit, because your ideas are being threatened.  The good news is that this is a wake up call for you. Your world is not made up of beliefs. If you stand quietly and observe the sights, smells, sounds of the office, almost everything is as it has been. Reality hasn't shifted.  Your idea is just being attacked and even though it's by someone you have no respect for it is still important to you. But not anymore. You see though the shit now.

Everyone on this sub knew a mid-January crash was going to happen, anyway. I saw predictions months ago. It's following standard economic theory, which is kind of surprising.

"Ya know, I sympathize... I do.  That being said...  
  
Cryptocurrency cannot, and will not, have its continued success assured until it stops being a speculative vehicle first and an actual currency dead. fucking. last.  
Yes, anecdotally, there are a few places that accept bitcoin or other altcoins.  But they are few and far between, and some of those are stopping because of the volatility.  
Can I pay my mortgage/rent with BTC? No.  
Can I pay my utilities with BTC? No.  
Can I go to Kroger/Safeway/IGA/Publix/Walmart/etc and buy groceries or other stuff with BTC? No.  
What can I do with BTC? Well... I can buy it.  I can trade it for other coins I also can't do any of the above with, and I can sell it.  If I get lucky I can buy it at $x.xx and sell it for $x.xx+n.  In other words, I can speculate with it.  I can, in some online marketplaces, trade it for goods from some other private individual (who only wants it on the speculative basis that it will rise in value from what it is today.  If he wants $100 for his widget, he'll charge me $100 worth of BTC hoping that he'll be able to sell that for $200 or more later).  
As long as BTC is in the hands of greed and speculators, volatility will continue to be too high for most retailers and other businesses to adopt it.  Too much risk.  
If a retailer pays $1000 for their widget and takes BTC for it, then BTC falls in price, they either lose money or they have to hold the BTC and hope for it to recover.  This hampers cash flow, and cash flow is one key need for the successful operation of a business.  
  
For bitcoin to ever achieve widespread adoption enough to absolutely ensure it will continue to succeed, speculation has to die down and the price has to stabilize.  That means nobody is going to be making a fortune on BTC anymore.  Considering that is directly going against the best interests of the speculators, who make up the VAST majority of BTC holders, that presents one hell of a problem and conflict of interest to overcome.";2;0;False;budlightguy;dstz68l;possibly the worst thing about this crash...;7qvjuv;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7qvjuv/possibly_the_worst_thing_about_this_crash/

"Ask them how they feel a year or two from now when the price is back over $20k. This isn’t specific to your situation. All the “economists” from the mainstream media who have been saying this for a while are probably gloating now too. I’ve seen some crypto traders on twitter basically saying “I told you so” as well. Remember a broken clock is correct twice a day. 

The thing to remember is this has already happened to bitcoin multiple times in the past where it lost 70% to 90% of its value only to eventually push higher. Perhaps we will never see another all time high and this run is over for good, but I have my doubts about that. 

Imagine these people calling it a bubble in 2013 and gloating when the price fell from $1k to $100 only to watch it eventually rise up to $20k. If people don’t get it, it’s not worth your time to be annoyed about it. They are going to be the ones who panic buy at $100k or higher.

"I am not here to gloat on the losses that bitcoiners have now, but I believe they didn't do their homework well enough to understand what really drives the market price of financial instruments in short term and in long term. It doesn't take a genius to understand that bitcoin fails at all 3 functions of money: 

1. It is terrible as an **exchange instrument**. High transaction costs, huge latency. 
2. It is unable to **store value**. Money is supposed to be stable and least volatile. All these huge prices changes day after day act against this funtion of money. 
3. It is bad at **evaluating things**. This one is linked to point 2. It's pointless to value real tangible and intangible things in BTC because it has huge volatility. 


As much as bitcoiners like to hate on FED and fiat money, the USD and other currencies of developed countries at least, are trying to anchor the money supply on the total value of goods produced you can acquire with that money. Look at BTC, there is no counter value here to which the bitcoin supply is anchored. All this proof of work, electricity wasted on mining are just expenses to maintain the system (very wasteful btw). It is not linked in any way to market price of bitcoin, which at its very essence is a contest of supply and demand. This extreme market volatility of BTC is a result of it having no real internal value that would help to stabilize it's market price. 


You are basically riding the hype/depression wave with bitcoin. The HODL mantra is just a clever ploy to fool ignorant people into restricting the BTC supply and drive the price up, while the real market manipulators rip the rewards from speculation. Learn this lesson well and don't get yourself fooled by mysterious and magical get rich quick schemes. When the the risk free interest rates can even be negative, expecting high yields with little risk is downright stupid. I would kill for a good investment opportunity with 7,2% p.a. with low risk and here we have poeple that expect 30%, 50%, 100% returns in a few months.

"But traditional currency is backed by faith in the system, regulators, etc. There's a reason why you have a currency market for buying selling money on a regulated exchange. Bitcoin and other crypto is unregulated and the creators aren't necessarily people you can hold accountable or have confidence in unlike the EU for the euro or the states for the dollar.

A currency that increases and decreases value by ridiculous margins daily is in no way stable. It's unsuitable for use as a currency because you have no idea if one day to the next it will be worth 1 pizza or 1000 pizzas. On the other hand a euro for example aside from long term inflation will be constant. Every day it's worth about 1/6 of a pizza and on a few years maybe 1/7.

Moreover you have a ton of people buying it not for it's use in transactions but to hodl. It's a bubble and at some point a lot of people are going to cash out, catch on, etc. and it's going to plummet.

"Bitcoin as a currency won't mean much unless it finds a way to be the bridge between the other projects using their own currency to fuel their technology, there's a reason why a bunch of people jumped ship at 15-20k when they figured out there were too many idiots pouring in (check 24h volume trends and media spread), and instead started investing in Alts that had strong projects backing them.  
  
The thing with bitcoin is that it's essentially the blockchain technology's prototype - it's nothing but a currency which can only find use if it's given the opportunity to be used by companies etc - the real deal lies within projects that utilize blockchain technology for more than just a currency, things like transactions that carry information, like API requests, 3D rendering etc - using the blockchain like a supercomputer that processes information for countless people all at once.  
  
Bitcoin is great, most definitely not a scam, right now we're just seeing a correction but the major sell-off by morons is definitely not helping - BTC is still in a very good state considering that at this point, it's still at a 1100% increase over the last year - but bitcoin's use is limited since it relies on others to be used, rather than itself.";1;0;False;xDrayken;dstizx9;possibly the worst thing about this crash...;7qvjuv;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7qvjuv/possibly_the_worst_thing_about_this_crash/

So in summary

1) I can spend it anywhere (I'll swap magic Internet money for an actual magical fungus if I damn well please)

2) Merchants can't steal my money, I have to sign every transaction

3) I don't need to log into shitty Internet banking, type in credit cards everywhere or save them in an insecure 
way, I just scan a qr code, enter my pin and hit send

"I hate to be that guy, but honestly this is a really small dip and the scamming is very limited compared to MT Gox or the last altcoin bubble popping.  Bitconnect was one of the more blatant ponzi schemes I've ever seen whereas MT Gox was literally the biggest exchange that existed.

I know this crash is really tough to swallow if you are new to bitcoin, but trust me MT Gox was just a completely different level for everyone who had coins on there.  The more experienced people always kept their funds off exchange, but many many people lost it all to MT Gox scamming and even those who actually held their own coins lost ~80% of their USD value.

Imagine today if coinbase went belly up and everyone who kept their funds on coinbase was broke and BTC went down to 3K.  That is about what it was like.  There are posts in /r/bitcoin basically every day telling people to keep their coins in a wallet and not on coinbase but this sub is full of idiots who don't listen or learn.

Nobody I know is talking shit because when I introduce them to crypto, I stress fundamentals like understanding the technology of the asset you're looking at, the extreme volatility, even market cap and how it relates to present value created by the networks and future opportunity. Also my own ignorance on crypto-assets I don't know much about at all. A correction like this shouldn't be a surprise to you or especially any newcomers you've spoken to.;1;0;False;ecib;dstgigt;possibly the worst thing about this crash...;7qvjuv;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7qvjuv/possibly_the_worst_thing_about_this_crash/

Bitcoin, and cryptocurrencies, have a very strong chance of being the currency of the future, and over maybe 50 or 60 years they may even be more stable than national governments - or less likely to experience sudden complete collapses anyway. So overall, bitcoin is a reasonable investment in the longrun, however those ordinary folk who jumped on the bandwagon hoping to get rich quick have been foolish. In the end, you can get paid for your labour or you can play the lottery, unless you have serious money to invest. There's nothing wrong with playing the lottery, as long as you know that's what you are doing. That's what I would say to John or Becky - having some bitcoin is a good idea for the future, but it's not really about getting rich quick. As soon as there is a way to reliably get rich quick, it would get reported on and eventually go away (therefore there cannot be reliable ways to get rich quick for long).;1;0;False;l_lecrup;dstvuua;possibly the worst thing about this crash...;7qvjuv;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7qvjuv/possibly_the_worst_thing_about_this_crash/

"exactly, people were going on and on and on about how they should hoard a currency. Flooded by people who wanted easy money with no working financial knowledge treating a currency like a product.

And no one found that a problem when MONEY is being treated like the BEANIE BABIES of the 90s. People forgot that money has a strict way it was supposed to act and was meant to be used in transactions.

The way people treat it, crypto is just a number in a wallet and people pay real money so their number can go up. The way people treat it, Bitcoin has no actual use.

and its gonna get worse as price fluctuations end up making trading in bitcoin worthless. No one will want to trade because they MIGHT lose money tomorrow.

Everyone was cheering on for rapid, unstable deflation as if that's how a currency should work. Except that makes paying in bitcoin harder. For fuck sake people who bought video games with it when bitcoin was worthless are now bitching about how they lose so much money and will never spend again.

"I feel the same way.  I was buying and selling bitcoin in 2013 and 2014... made a couple hundred bucks a couple times and sold.  I was watching how it was used on darknet markets years ago... I understood the general concept of blockchain and a bit of the math behind bitcoin.  As I saw it climb higher and higher at different times over the years I felt a sort of regret like “I was watching this with interest when it was much lower and less publicized than today and all these people made money and I missed the boat.”  Every time it made a run I thought I missed the run up and that it was too late to jump in.  And then it would run up again.  I had read stories in the past about Isaac Newton and the ‘tulip bubble’ - that he bought in and sold for a modest profit and stayed on the sidelines... as he saw everyone around him getting rich he decided to jump in so he wouldn’t continue missing out on the gains.  Turns out he bought at a peak and as the price tumbled he bailed at the bottom and lost everything... right before it went back up. Market psychology can get the best of the smartest of the smart.

I came to the conclusion that sure I was into it before it really took off and I had an understanding of the technology and knew it was new and novel... but if I had bought and held would I really have been any smarter?  I would’ve been luckier.  Understanding the technology and potential applications is an altogether different thing than understanding the market for it.  I had too many doubts that I still wonder today.  What is so special about bitcoin over other crypto currencies or over potential future crypto currencies?  Is it the name?  The fact it was first?   Does that guarantee it’ll end up the dominant crypto currency or even an important one as the technology evolves?  The vast majority of the value of bitcoin isn’t coming from people buying it because it’s useful and easy to spend places, they’re buying speculating on its value alone - in the long term that speculation would seem to be a bet that it will become useful in an economic sense beyond just speculation.  It isn’t so cut and dry as just understanding it’s a revolutionary technology... if I’d bought and held in 2013 it would’ve been more a function of my mood at the time than of my keen market sense.  In all honesty I just didn’t understand what fundamentally drives the market and stayed away.  I don’t regret it anymore.

During the 2008 recession I remember being just out of college and hearing the government was going to bail out the banks by purchasing bank debt and preferred stocks of the big banks.  The preferred stocks of major banks were selling at a 10-12% yield in many cases while treasuries were next to nothing.  I thought ‘simple! just invest alongside the government- their investments won’t fail because they won’t let them fail and I’ll be buying a super high yield asset at a time when the market is starving for income.”  It was successful I did very well and saw my money multiply many times over.  I was just out of college and felt that I bought something with low risk high reward and that I killed it and profited from the recession.  Any experience like that makes you feel smart and it’s hard to resist that feeling.  I became overconfident in my abilities and went on to make what I thought would be brilliant investments that flopped.  A famous investor once said you aren’t as smart as success makes you feel, but you aren’t as dumb as failure would make you believe either.  Market psychology is a powerful thing... I’m glad for everyone that’s had success with bitcoin but there are a lot of people that are getting carried away it’s pretty obvious as an outside observer.";1;0;False;usofmind;dssq0ri;possibly the worst thing about this crash...;7qvjuv;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7qvjuv/possibly_the_worst_thing_about_this_crash/

Gold was used as a storage because it's material, which people hoped it would always retain most of it's value. Not so popular these days, becaus it's price turned out more unstable than people thought.

"The issue isnt needing a correction, the issue is that the market is easily manipulated by very few people.  Its weird because this forum generally holds anti big bank sentiment and fiat hate and also hate any one individual entity controlling a market (hence the whole decentralized crypto being an appealing thought), without realizing that crypto is far more easier for one entity to manipulate than fiat since its completely un-regulated.

You are literally putting your entire faith that the holder or creator of that currency doesnt just dump all the assets they have into the market causing it to crash while they make bank.  There is little to nothing stopping them from doing this. 

I would argue that in crypto market, you will see a ton of this going on for years to come unless some form of regulation is put on the market.   Very few people will end up making 40 to 100+ percent profit, most of the HODL'ers will end up loosing out nearly everything they invested.

I have no financial background so I was wondering the same thing. Decentralized currency obviously hurts banks at the most basic level. Your answer makes sense that they can better handle the exchanges. HOWEVER, back to the basic level of banks' existence, they  will charge higher transaction fees for using their more stable exchange.

"This sounds like my story lol. It's important with any investment to treat it like one. I see so many people treating crypto like the casino, read white papers, invest in ideas that scream potential to you. Quit chasing the pumps, doin that may work well in the short term but it's not how life changing wealth comes about, at least not for most. People also need to get into a better mental space..never feel bad to realize profits on success. Around here I see the mentality of ""missing out on gains"" so so much. Remember everyone a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush, especially if you can get your self to a point of completely having removed your initial investment costs. 

That's where your gains truly become life changing, because you have the opportunity to invest money you made from smart decisions. If you keep looking for longer term potential and seeking value rather then spectacle, you can really do well... Even in a volatile market like we have here.

"Granted, the scam that was BCC had to end, but you do realise many people actually got severely hurt with the collapse right? Sure they were foolish and misguided, but only a sociopath would call the BCC collapse ""good news"".

Aside from the fact vulnerable people got hurt, the other reason the BCC collapse is bad news, is it damages the crypto sphere's reputation as a whole. BCC was not only able to exist, but become one of the biggest cryptos, yet was a clear scam. Now people will be questioning what other parts of crypto are a scam, and quite frankly they'd be sensible to ask such questions.

"I think it's yet to come. And by that I mean our next leader community coin, not some shitty FIAT sovereign debt basket or something. 

It might be some kind of Bitcoin airdrop. 

If there was a Bitcoin airdrop that is low energy POW - problem set gamified in time (temporal) instead of hashing power - the really hard part, with a fast block lattice consensus, capped at 21 million with mining fee paid through inflation that asymptotically gets close to zero as you get to 21 million, maybe 16 decimals instead of 8. Something like that would be nice.  Named 'Bitcoin Pay' or something. And after all that it would have to survive years of rigour like Bitcoin did. Only then would it be worthy to dethrone the master. 

I think the perfect coin will come but to satisfy the community, it might have to be a Bitcoin airdrop, or a spork like Bitcoin Private to keep everyone happy. It will have the perfect blend of low energy use, sustainable inflation to reward miners, fast throughput and a hard maximum supply. It will come I think.
 
Most altcoins crash harder than bitcoin but they recover quicker too.

">I personally hope it shakes the greedy people off and liberates us like it was designed to do. A world wide currency, untouchable by our greedy governments.

You're a major faggot for writing this.

Greed is good. Greed makes the world go round. It's your desire to get a promotion, or start a new enterprise, or invest for a return. Greed is wanting more for yourself. Greed is wanting the BEST LIFE you can possibly have, because THIS IS your life and it's the only one you get, so you want it to be the best it can possibly be.

I'm greedy with my time. I got tired of working shit jobs for minimum wage, and what little money I earned and saved **depreciated** in value year after year. Punished for saving.... Then I learned about bitcoin. Finally an asset I could own and hoard, that would GAIN value, and improve my life in the future.

If you want an altruistic coin buy more Doge and have fun buying ad space on racecars or whatever it is they do. I'm in this for ME and MY family. I couldn't care less about you and yours. I don't wish you ill but I have no patience for people who don't want to claw their way up, or people who virtue signal toward those who do. I'm in this game thanks to my own greed. It's why I refuse to sell. My hold game has been strong and will continue to be. 

>I am a proud owner of 1.5 BTC.

If I ever get to the point where I only own 1.5btc it will be because I have lost all hope in the project and cashed out. If that happens you can be sure my greed will have led me to greener pastures or I will have diversified to stocks, bonds, gold, or something else. Honestly, you have given up entirely on bitcoin, you are down to 0.0025 of your original 600 but you are lecturing people about how you believe in bitcoin changing the system.

"For the most part all coins are gonna crash hard initially due to the USD drop in BTC. Once BTC starts rallying the following should happen until maybe late summer when there's another altcoin season.

Useless pump and dump coins like XDN, DOGE, REDD are gonna crash constantly. 

Coins with good backing and devs that actually care about the coin are gonna crash/stay level overall, but have random pump spikes throughout. Examples are DASH, XMR, and XLM.

Then you have coins that could actually be used post crypto bubble pop. These will crash constantly but could explode like ETH did last year at any moment. Examples are LINK, KNC, ZRX, and VEN.
