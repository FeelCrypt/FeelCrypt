">The supposed targets were blackmailers and extortionists, willing to ruin the lives of multiple people for financial gain. This situation was only possible because of the black market nature of Silk Road, which mean you couldn't go to the cops (and why should you? The cops were coming to you, in the form of the blackmailers and extortionists.) The threatened exposure by the blackmailers and the extortionists would have ruined and killed many people. This was not putting a hit out on somebody 'disrespecting' him, or anything like that. These were acts of self-defense, and the defense of others.

This isn't really a defense. Ross BELIEVED that he had people killed. He believed he received images of a dead man. He believed he ordered the killing of a unit full of people. The killings may not have been real, but to Ross, his belief was that they were.

"> Why do you have any right/claim to stay?

Because forcefully taking over an area and claiming that the inhabitants are obligated to give them money is inherently hypocritical and unsound in its reasoning.

>Who cares.

Obviously you do by stating that they must leave or be obligated to give them money. You have proven no basis on which they have such an obligation.

>you can either accept it voluntarily, fight it (and win, or lose), or leave.

'Voluntarily' is not being used in its normal meaning here. Does a cashier voluntarily give money to a robber at gunpoint? In a certain sense yes, they do; in that they can direct the actions of their body, yet in another they are not since it is being done under duress.

According to the State's own terms, it is guilty of extortion, conversion, assault, kidnapping, and murder; yet it grants itself immunity from such actions.

>when you strip out these preconceptions and societal norms, you realize there isn't anything innately ""wrong"" about the mob coming in

Let's assume for argument's sake that their is no morality. In that instance, there is still no obligation on the population's part to leave. There is entirely no obligation to do anything whatsoever.

Yet the state speaks in terms of morality and societal obligations. So if you view this from a moral basis or not, one MUST come to the conclusion that any claim on part of the state of the right to rule over others is false and has no basis in reason or evidence.

>These ancap bullshit arguments miss

"The process for DNM arrests is complicated and tedious because of the fact that it's very difficult to obtain hard evidence. Ross had multiple agencies from multiple countries investigating the case for multiple years before they could find him and make an arrest, and even when they did, all it would take was his laptop being closed to ruin every speck of evidence they had. The only way for a small time user to get busted is for a package to be discovered, they're not paying people to search for the kid ordering a gram of MDMA. And if their package is discovered, how do you prove that they knew that package was coming? Even with the controlled delivery technique (getting the person to sign for the package to ""prove"" they knew the drugs were coming) a half-assed lawyer can clear the charges. I've had weeks where I've gotten 20+ packages from Amazon, so I have no clue what every package is going to look like. I'm not encouraging people to use the DNM, but it's a lot easier to get away with than people think. 

Imagine a scenario where someone mails you drugs with intent of it getting discovered and you getting arrested. The cops can't just go, oh this has your name on it, it has to be yours!

It's not tainting if the Courts allow it and it follows the rules of evidence and criminal procedure.

>there is a difference from you saying how the prosecution was allowed to get away with doing certain things as not being totally wrong, and what this guy was saying as dirty and gagging the defense.

I don't understand what you're saying here. I'm not saying the prosecution was allowed to get away certain things that weren't totally wrong. I'm saying the prosecution adhered to the law and ran a good case.

Also, the guy wasn't clear about what was dirty and how the defense was gagged, so I still don't know what you're talking about. Be very specific i.e. on X date the Judge did Y.

>kinda like 'it aint cheating if you get away with it'

What the hell are you talking about? Make a specific allegation of a failure of due process.

>this was a theater case to show power to the system

Not really, I mean it may show the system's power, but it wasn't theater, and frankly what the guy was doing was illegal under any interpretation of the law, and there's no question he did it. I don't get what you're getting at here.

>the prosecution even goes on and on to 'make an example' out of him.

How so? I mean, if you mean asking the judge to be harsh on him, this happens all the time in many cases during sentencing depending on the Prosecutions understanding of the crimes. When you take a plea deal, and cooperate, you usually see a sentencing recommendation of leniency. But asking for strong sentencing isn't abnormal and doesn't imply impropriety.

>it comes down to freedom and control waayyyy more than someone selling drugs.

It's as if the judge is somehow so irked by the fact that people who *might* not be desperately poor would have their safety increased on keg party weekends that the judge completely overlooks the fact that reducing drug sales in the ""violent ghettos"" by doing them online will invariably reduce gang activity and, thus, reduce violence for a poor neighborhood, something which they have to deal with every day and not just on keg party weekends.

"Why don't you believe Ross did it as an act of libertarianism? He spent a significant amount of time writing libertarian rants, we know that he's read some amount of libertarian literature (Mises, Rothbard…). I'm not saying Ross was doing it for purerly altruistic reasons, but I definitely believe he was politically motivated to some extent. I too felt the jolt of history upon learning about the Silk Road and realized the political implications of Bitcoin. It's a historic turn for drug policy in favor of abandoning prohibition. A minor revolution.

Drugs aren't without their downsides, but the war on drugs is a great tragedy of our time. The data overwhelmingly shows that drug prohibition has little or no effect on the overall consumption among a population. We know that adult users rarely have a problematic relationship to drugs. We know that drug abuse is highly contextual. We know that criminalization is extremely destructive and that care actually works. And yet we perpetuate this failed political project that really hasn't accomplished anything it set out to do, but in the mean time put over 1% of the American population behind bars, basically caused societal breakdown in south american nations, ruined hundreds of thousands of lives around the world. Why? We know it's not working, why are we doing this?

"> Your statement made no mention of the US, it was clearly about societies in general, and it was wrong. Here it is again.

The statement you responded to initially did make mention of the US, so your response there and the points you made were confusing because they were made in the wrong context. Ironically, when you clarified, I accepted your clarification and moved on, whereas you have continued in your misunderstanding.

>it was clearly about societies in general, and it was wrong. Here it is again.

The original statement contained an implied premise. Because not all societies allow you to leave (a society like North Korea clearly exists and does not let its citizens leave), there is no reasonable interpretation of my comment as being applicable universally. I am clearly discussing a society which does allow you to leave, and since we're on an American website, and the other conversant was American, it can be inferred I'm discussing the US. You either accidentally misread it, or are choosing to ignore the implied premise. I've clarified twice for you.

My intended meaning is all that matters. Otherwise you're having a debate about semantics. You misunderstanding a statement does not make the statement wrong. There are different ""senses"" of words.

>How is that ""very clearly only about the US.""?

If you read back, when I used the phrase ""very clearly"" it was when I said you responded to a follow up statement which was very clearly only about the US. The follow up statement contained the word ""US."" That statement was very clearly about the US.

I did not, as you imply here, say the original statement was very clearly about the US. Your reading comprehension is terrible or you are intentionally lying about what I said.

Now let's parse the statement you just brought up. 

>Within a society there is no concept of self-ownership. You are allowed to leave the society.

The first part is universal. Within a society there is no concept of self-ownership. That applies to all societies except ones which specifically give you self ownership, but then it wouldn't really be a society. There are some logical issues here. I can't really imagine what that society would be.

Now, ""You are allowed to leave the society"" is applicable to the US and to many other modern societies, including the society the person I was addressing ""you"" is a participant in (he appears to be American) and ""the society"" is not all societies but the specific society he is a part of. I doubt he's North Korean. He's allowed to leave whether through renunciation or physically leaving, he can end his association with the particular social contract he is a party to.

You misread it. Deal with it.

>It was also wrong, even if it was only about the US.

No. It isn't. You can leave the US. 

http://travel.state.gov/content/travel/english/legal-considerations/us-citizenship-laws-policies/renunciation-of-citizenship.html

>You still don't seem to understand that you can't definitely leave the US permanently, even if you do give up citizenship, because you may well be shipped back.

I understand your point. I understood your point the first time you said it. I am going to be repeating myself. You still don't seem to realize that your point that other countries may send you back or fuck with you doesn't make my point wrong. Even if you are returned, you can leave again and go somewhere else. Being returned is not something the US does to you, it is not the society in question which is forcing you back into it but another society/government whatever.

The point is that as long as the society in question allows its members to leave formally or to leave informally and not exert control over them extraterritorially, there is no moral issue with asserting control over individuals inside the society, there is no self-ownership within the society, and the society is in its nature ""voluntary.""

Get it?

>And it's not about North Korea (nice straw man BTW). Most countries do not allow you to become stateless.

I am repeating myself again. Try to read what I say and consider the possibility that you may be saying things which are not actually counterpoints. I understand many nations do not allow you to become stateless, but they do not impose their laws on you extraterritorially.

For example, one reason the US lets you become stateless is because it imposes its tax policy on its citizens internationally. Physically leaving the US is not sufficient to leave it's sphere of influence. However with most if not all other countries, simply leaving the country in question is sufficient. There are some exceptions of course, but these outliers aren't germane to the conversation because the point is about the ethical and moral basis of the society, and the concept of self-ownership.

Almost all modern, first world countries, like the US are voluntary associations where individuals surrender self-ownership in order to enjoy a variety of benefits. And in my view, there is nothing wrong with this. Deal with it.

If you want to make an argument against that core point, and not some semantic mangling of my words, go for it. Otherwise we're done here.

That's not really what happened. He wasn't SENTENCED for murder, he was sentenced based off of EVERYTHING he did while running the criminal enterprise which could include a life sentence depending on the severity of what he did. That just happened to ALSO include murder for hire which increased his already long sentence. ;0;0;False;moldymoosegoose;crr3n81;Silk Road operator Ross Ulbricht to sentenced life in prison;37rfjz;http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/may/29/silk-road-ross-ulbricht-sentenced
"You're *kind of* correct.

In the event that you are *boned to all hell* and don't have a chance at winning, you plead guilty on a plea bargain in order to reduce your sentencing. The logic is that, in exchange for your cooperation in making the trial short by skipping all the debate and procedure, you get a lighter sentence.

However, very, very few cases are foolproof, because it all comes down to interpretation. Say that I'm at the range and I shoot and kill someone. One interpretation is that I murdered that person - I had the intent to shoot and kill them. Another interpretation is that it's *just* manslaughter - I was at fault for the death, but I didn't intend to murder someone. Another interpretation entirely is that it was sheerly accidental - it was a freak ricochet, and I can't be placed at fault at all.

With varying scales of severity (murder, manslaughter, etc) comes different standards for evidence. If you're going to try someone for murder, you have a much higher standard to fulfill - you have to prove that someone did it *and* that they had intent. With manslaughter, you just have to prove that they did it, regardless of intent, which requires less numerous, and less vigorous evidence.

So, this comes into play two ways: first, prosecutors will only try for the charge they know they can win, and defenders will try to disprove the charge either by saying that it didn't happen *or* that it wasn't as bad as being prosecuted. What's important is that, in many legal systems, defendants have protection against **double jeopardy,** that is, being tried for the same crime twice. This is why prosecutors have to be very careful in how much they want to go for (related: that's why most cases involving ""treason"" aren't tried as such, because it's patently impossible to prove; instead, lesser charges like ""espionage"" or ""conspiracy"" are pressed).

So, if you're found not guilty of *murder* even if you were guilty of manslaughter, if you're found not guilty you can't be retried in a criminal court - you can be taken to a civil court, however.

In Ulbricht's case, and many cases, it wasn't so much a case of ""I didn't do anything wrong"" but ""I didn't do stuff *as bad as you're accusing me of.*"" It's easier for the defense to handle and tougher for the prosecution to batter down, since the burden of proof is on them.
