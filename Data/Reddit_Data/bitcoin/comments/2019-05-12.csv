That's just because the old doofus never had the smarts to acquire any Bitcoin. So if he can't prosper from it, then he doesn't want anyone else to either. In any case, apparently the current Administration doesn't agree with him, including the SEC Chairman. So the guy is reasonably alone in his stance on the issue...üí©;1;0;False;51percentile;en66sgj;Today in Congress Rep. Sherman called for a bill to ban all cryptocurrencies.

"If you want a secure border then use drones and sensors.  A physical wall is expensive and does not actually accomplish the intended goal. 

The argument I have against the wall is that it‚Äôs not a good use of tax dollars. 

It will end up never being finished and a perpetual money sink where private contractors (in some way connected to Trump or his cronies) will forever be ‚Äúworking on it‚Äù and it will NEVER be done. You will pay for that way for generations. 


AND it won‚Äôt stop the influx of illegal immigrants. 

You know what will stop them?

Working with Mexico to establish good trade relations and helping them stabilize their economy so that jobs are there.

Does this also mean if it goes down in value, you can't claim losses on it? So essentially the IRS doesn't acknowledge it until it turns into cash? Also, what if you first obtain Bitcoin in a way other than buying it, such as sselling a good in exchange for it, or being gifted BTC by someone? in that case when can they tax you?;1;1;False;;en60g1r;$6k Bitcoin like..;blreid;https://v.redd.it/b3umbva2vsw21

"Wait, like for real? I thought it would be possible to stop or slow aging, but not to reverse it.

This is huge, if it really works well without side effects, you're essentially creating immortality.

Who couldn't become a billionaire if they had 200 years to slowly invest in real estate and exponentially make more by renting the homes and buildings they know to others and buying more property?

I suspect this could end pretty badly with some jealous youngings getting sick of the 250 year old men making their lives hell by artificially raising rent, then taking action by uniting in mobs and going to 250 yo's houses to brutally murder them.

Wouldn't want to be a 250 year old, however, something like living to age 100 with a 20yo body would be nice";2;0;False;;en611si;$6k Bitcoin like..;blreid;https://v.redd.it/b3umbva2vsw21
