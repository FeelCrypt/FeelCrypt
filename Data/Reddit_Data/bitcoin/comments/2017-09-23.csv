"For the interim period, yes.  But then most things are.  Bitcoin is, arguably, the only thing that's actually impacting the real world and ordinary people, bar a few behind the scenes infrastructure pilots with ethereum.  But even ETH has no consumer adoption; it's nearly all used to fuel speculation on exchanges.

Impossible to say what Litecoin could do further down the line once atomic swaps, lightning, rootstock, blockstack are all well established.  I would see Litecoin over LN being used as the defacto choice for merchants and everyday western coffee purchases, with bitcoin being used as settlement for the purchase of real estate, land registry, insurance, commodities, aswell as forming the defacto settlement layer for all those transactions packaged up over LN.  

Even from a personal security standpoint, knowing all your bitcoins are locked away safe in a hardware wallet, and being able to go out with Litecoin on your phone like you might cash in your pocket, starts making more sense to everyone.

Will also be interesting to see what Google and others could do with Litecoin in the micropayments and machine-payable web space.  Although perhaps something with ethereum or another dedicated alt running over LN might make more sense there.

It's also difficult to say what might happen if 2X force a contentious hardfork.  Litecoin may end up being the place Bitcoin Core devs focus most of their time with Garzik et al being left to their own devices...  I assume Jeff wants to avoid that, but if he plays fast and loose with replay protection, then who knows?  Only so much under-appreciated hardworking devs will put up with before looking for a more harmonious working environment.

That's not to say a third fork wouldn't happen further down the line mind, with Core coming back after a few years of hardcore litecoin / lightning development that could be ported over to a new version of Bitcoin with different mining algos in place.  I love the eco-friendly Proof Of Space ideas Bram Cohen came up with for instance.  He seems to be working pretty close to Adam and the lightning team, so maybe a few surprise announcements regarding PoW are going to be in order.

These are all issues that need to be addressed over the next few years as this matures and that tells me Litecoin is massively undervalued and under-appreciated in the grand scheme of things.  FWIW it is, in my view, more important than Ethereum.

But I don't know any more than anyone else about the future, been wrong so many times, it's impossible to say how the myriad variables will unfold.  

Wouldn't be any fun if we did know though, right?

This is what happens with all fiat currencies and will happen to the US dollar despite it being the world reserve currency.

"Everyone thinks Marx is just about communism, but actually a lot of what he wrote earlier is super-relevant right now... or rather, the later thinkers who pointed out problems with his ideas are relevant. Which, if they are thinking about him, that makes him relevant by association... or something.

One of the big criticism of Marx is that while he understood technology's role in disrupting the relationship between work and capital, he wrote as if technology (and science) just sort of turned up one day, like they came ""from without"".

But of course tech and science are also products of work, and the question had to be asked: if an owner of capital provides his workers with a bunch of steel, then they work on it and turn it into cars, and then those cars are sold at a profit which goes back to the owner thus increasing his capital...

...what exactly was it that made the steel turn into more capital? It's still the same steel, the workers just bent it around a bit. Marx (and many others) talked about how the *work itself* created the profit, not the end product. 

And this idea that work is worth something, and you should be PAID for your work instead of just given a warm place to sleep and a castle to hide in when the Huns come, is absolutely key to our system of exchange of *energy* that lies underneath all our money and markets and fiat and barter and whatever. When you sell something, what are you really selling? Your work.

But what Marx didn't properly take into account (some say) is the work done elsewhere to come up with the design of the car. Well, that's not quite right - he understood there were designers and draughtsmen etc doing work in the other room, but he'd talk about how their work was affected by *new technology*, how that would change their designs ""from outside""  - new grades of steel, new types of piston linings, a new way of controlling the car. And he didn't really explain how that fits into the rest of the system, very well. 

Marx has the classes, right? The working class and all that. But recently, various philosophers (McKenzie Wark for instance), talked about another class that doesn't make product, they make ""forms"". 

Satoshi is a perfect example - while his specific design of BTC can be seen as a design product, the whole idea of this kind of design is a ""form"" he (building on the ""forms"" of others) came up with. Wark called them ""the hacker class"" and I think we're still trying to come up with a slightly less lame-sounding name...

"I don't think you understand.  Look at this objectively.  Just play along, then you can continue acting righteous if you want.

Let's say you only have $500 available to buy anything. 


Ok, lemme put it all in bitcoin.  Looking at the market right now, that'll get me $500/3621 = 0.138083402375034 bitcoins.

Realistically, we can expect the $3621 coin to be worth about $3800 in a day or so if it's a realistic ""average good rise"". My $500 will be worth $524.  It's about a 5% rise.

Now lemme buy my lite coins, which are, right now, 48.20.  For $500 I can buy 10.37344398340248 lite coins. 

I can easily expect them to go to $55 in a few days.  That gives me about $570, or a 15% rise.


You can easily expect a $7 rise in price, despite being a huge percent.  I don't think you'll see huge rises in bitcoin in short periods of time - for bitcoin to give me the same profit, that would mean it has to rise about $500.  I find it more likely to see a 15% rise in litecoin in a week than a 15% increase in bitcoin. ";-2;0;False;uber1337h4xx0r;dndnja5;Asking a J.P.

"You're right, there's a huge difference between percent growth and linear growth.  But what I'm saying is that it's far more likely for $100 worth of litecoin to double your money than for $100 worth of bitcoin to do the same, simply because of the linear values ($50 increase in ltc = $3500 increase in bitcoin when it comes to a specific value of invested money).

That said, obviously if you can only keep the profit of selling a percent of profit from a single coin vs the same percent for selling a bitcoin, the bitcoin is obscenely better.

"This is a much closer analogy. Not perfect but much better at least.

It's not like bitcoin threatens and bank. Banks can start *using* bitcoin or offering bitcoin if they really wanted to, at least if regulators didn't say no. As it is, bitcoin is already being used as an investment vehicle and banks will buy in (probably have already) if they think it's safe and profitable. You can call something stupid for good reasons without being biased or whatever the fuck. It'd be stupid AF to buy Tesla calls at $500 expiring in three months. That doesn't mean I don't own Tesla stock.

I think you are misunderstanding how blockchain-based money is different than every single other investment vehicle in history. It is indeed a currency, but it's backed by something more powerful a government: the miners. They are motivated by profit (in the form of bitcoin of course), and as long as bitcoin is valuable, people will keep mining, keeping the network strong. The stronger the network, the more demand there is for bitcoin. The more demand there is for bitcoin, the stronger the network. Banks can't use bitcoin to their advantage -- no one needs a bank to use bitcoin, and if bitcoin overtakes the dollar, no one needs banks (that includes the world's biggest bank: JP Morgan).;3;1;False;rektumsempra;dne7vxl;Asking a J.P.

Because once bitcoins value stabilizes there won't be any reason to hold on to a zero yield asset anymore except for hedging against potential risk. The smart money keep getting richer because they invest in the economy, but the majority of people are unfortunately financial illiterates and choose to hoard their money in savings accounts and buy gold. In the last eight years the equity markets have quadrupled in value while gold has lost almost half its value. Equity markets will endure through the big corrections and continue to grow with the economy while assets like gold and bitcoin will produce zero value and stagnate. 

We don't know where bitcoins stable price point will be in the future so it's a good long term investment for now.

"I hope you're also aware that it doesn't change my explanation.  If you spend $500 on a piece of a bitcoin and the price spikes by like $500, you get like $20 selling it.  You spend $500 on ""a piece"" of a litecoin (10/2, so 5 pieces), then you make $2500.


Think of it this way - remember when bitcoin was like $50?  Was it better to buy them back them and sell when they went to $2000?


Or to buy bitcoin with the same amount of money you had, but when it's $3500 and sell when it goes up to $5000?


(hint: the answer is the former because you get a lot more shares and that lets you grow your profit)



A simple example:

Lets say i have a sword and a gun.  Which is better?  The gun obviously because it's like 10 times stronger.


Let's say instead someone let me have either 7 swords (with wielders) or one revolver.  The swords would win barely since the gun person only gets 6 shots. 

Now let's say some sort of deal happens and I can quadruple both. 

So now i have 4 guns (24 bullets) vs 28 sword dudes. 

Not the most amazing example, but hopefully it makes sense why smaller shares, but more quantity can lead to greater profits.

Some people are wise to sit it out and wait and watch bitcoin and trust their particular circumstances and personal risk-tolerances, or be wary of their own lack of knowledge of how to property hold and secure bitcoin. . . but these people should not be criticizing bitcoin on the grounds of their personal preferences; nor should they attack and spread FUD, unless they are shorting bitcoin. . . in which case, they should not complain about the volatility. . .which profits them.

">backed by something more powerful a government: the miners

no sorry. I get the concept, and in theory it's a compelling one, and who knows, there's probably some universe where it REALLY takes off. And there will always be a value to owning something like bitcoin, but something like the USD is backed officially by the full faith and credit of the United States Treasury... and less officially, by the *historical* strength of the US economy, by the strength of our political system, by our military if you really want to go that far. It's backed by the ""fact"" that the USD will always be valuable, at LEAST relatively. If the world goes to shit and countries start to fail, it's a safe bet to say the US will be one of the last to fail. Maybe it won't be, but which other country has a higher *chance*? The world has an interest in our continued strength, even something like China does. 60% of global reserve currency is in USD.

>Banks can't use bitcoin to their advantage

What does this even mean?

>if bitcoin overtakes the dollar, no one needs banks (that includes the world's biggest bank: JP Morgan)

JP Morgan is not the world's largest bank. And why do people no longer need banks? Because miners will loan money on a peer-to-peer level?

Pretty much. Awesome right? A massive aspect of strong economic growth!

"Not sure how this

> Everyone at Big Banks are somehow all-powerful evil geniuses who care only about profit and simultaneously too stupid to pass on what is the 'greatest investment ever

backs up your first sentence at all. And I don't think this tweet did anything other than display a total ignorance of what JP Morgan OR other investment banks OR Bitcoin are.

He's right about the currency crackdown. And if banks aren't investing in Bitcoin, it's because they either can't do so with a high enough degree of certainty, ie they're like penny stocks, or because they don't know enough about it.

People here are going on about ""uhhh well why would they not invest in bitcoin if they didn't hate bitcoin? there's no volatility in the market or chance to make money, so isn't this exactly what big banks are looking for?"" Penny stocks are highly volatile. You don't see JP Morgan investing in them.";2;1;False;BenFoldsFourLoko;dndup89;Asking a J.P.
