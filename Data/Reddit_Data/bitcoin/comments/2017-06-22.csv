Was mentioning what I believe / feel. There is no pump & dump involved. Aeternity just raised 60 million USD and from my point of view looks like the only legitimate ICO of recent days, as they are not just building another ERC20 based company, but a platform that will overcome the issues BTC and ETH are currently having, especially where transaction speed is slowing them down. Re-reading what I wrote, I can see it does sound like I'm pumping it, but that wasn't the intention. There are no guarantees where it will head, but it does look promising (in my personal opinion).. everyone can do the research themselves.

"> Bitcoin is in theory infinitely divisible, but in current application there are two floors

I mean, in any but paper application, there are floors. It is literally impossible to store any number in computer memory. What I tried to imply is that even when using physical objets for storing numbers - might be certain count of atoms, lengths of objects, properties of field, etc., we can't go infinitely small.

Also, I thank you a lot for explaining so thoroughly. My line of thinking was mostly theoretical and I didn't bother about the real blockchain. But I find it iteresting that there is a (artificially) specified lower bound and that actually changing it would require a hard fork. :)";1;0;False;SnuffleShuffle;dj98xzl;Spurring a lot of conversations with this one...;6igopz;https://i.redd.it/byr5ioixyu4z.jpg

"Four years? Ha!  Do you know how long the internet existed before Netflix, eBay and Amazon?  

The analogies are spot-on and mirror almost perfectly with the evolution of .com.  In 1990, you could make the same argument that no one used the Internet except for a very small section of the population.  Those that did have access only used it for sending e-mail and visiting newsgroups.  Go ahead four years to 1994/1995 - eBay starts, Yahoo starts, Amazon starts as a bookstore!

Guess I've never used a broker like that.

Apparently, there are special brokerages or programs that do that, but it can be problematic, like selling sometimes, or transferring to another broker.  I'm guessing that you are not the legal owner of the stock - certainly not for any partial shares.  So, you can't really sell them except within the company that sold them to you - they would be the actual owners, right?;1;0;False;leftcoast-usa;dj82h09;Spurring a lot of conversations with this one...;6igopz;https://i.redd.it/byr5ioixyu4z.jpg
"Shares can't, strictly, be divided.  But if you were a company that wanted to offer that facility to your customers, it wouldn't be hard to do -- since all you need to do is find ten customers who all want part of a share, then you buy the whole share yourself and deal with the split (and dividend payouts) in your systems instead of in the stock exchange systems.

But the actual ""owner"" of the share is the share dealing company, since there can be only one.

If it were the general case that you could own part of a share, then stock splits would never be necessary.";1;1;False;kingofthejaffacakes;dj97obc;Spurring a lot of conversations with this one...;6igopz;https://i.redd.it/byr5ioixyu4z.jpg

"Almost everywhere, but the method might be different.  Most major brokerages have DRIP, which reinvests your dividends into fractional shares of the stock.

There are also platforms like Motif where you essentially build ETFs with fractional shares.

Motif, and many platforms like FolioFirst, Loyal3, and tons of others allow you to invest a dollar amount and get fractional shares of single stocks.
