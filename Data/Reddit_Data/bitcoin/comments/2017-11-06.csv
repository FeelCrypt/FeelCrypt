Was property in Detroit a scam? Were tulips in 17th century Holland a scam?

Hold no matter what is literally not a strategy because ""no matter what"" means ""I will do this regardless of what results it produces"". ""hold no matter what"" is just a feeling from people who are afraid to realize losses and sunk costs.

The reason many governments are nominally socialist is because those countries had legitimate, large-scale people's uprisings and worker movements that were ultimately crushed.

"> This is true, and that's why ""investing"" in bitcoin is actually speculating, not investing

 Complete bullshit.   I'm investing in the technology.  Investment requires an understanding of the asset you are acquiring, whether that is for dividends, or as a venture capitalist to invest in the seed round of a start-up so that you can sell your stock in the product for an increased price at some later date, or an asset you acquiring because you expect it to increase in value at a later date for justifiable reasons.  

Just so you know, this isn't my particular bent.  This is what I've gotten [from Warren Buffet](https://theweek.com/articles/459166/how-warren-buffett-made-10-billion-during-financial-crisis).  When he invested in banks during the 2007 financial crisis, it wasn't because he was expecting dividends.  He was expecting to buy low and sell high.  And you don't get a bigger value investor than Warren Buffet.

All this is a bit of a muchness though.  If you don't want to invest in bitcoin don't.  I'm a big believer in making sure you don't invest in things you don't understand.  For me, it's stupid not to act on things that I know that, as it turns out, I've been pretty well spot-on in.

">Increasing or decreasing the amount of currency is not relevant nor would it be an answer. But bitcoin is infinitely frangible. In other words, if the entire world economy were in bitcoin then bitcoin would be worth about $107 trillion dollars. $4761904.76 per bitcoin. About 0.047 cents per Satoshi. Want to buy something worth 1 penny? Make a transaction for 1/5th of a Satoshi. Change is already made in millisatoshi. Get it? You can keep dividing it down infinitely.

That doesn't address anything I've said. You were the one who talked about deflation somehow being required to handle influx of wealth from asteroidal mining, and I pointed out that you can deflate fiat currency much quicker than bitcoin.

Frangibility has nothing to do with deflation. Bitcoin is deflationary because there's a fixed and decreasing supply and a total cap on supply of bitcoins. If bitcoin had no cap and an increasing rate of supply it would be inflationary regardless of how frangible it was.

Fiat currency is also infinitely frangible. They could print a $0.00001 note or make a $1,000,000,000 coin. Most fiat currency is digital already, ignoring that the value of currency doesn't change fast enough for them to worry about not being able to print a new note quick enough.

If dollars started deflating they could easily start pulling out higher denomination notes and start printing 10 cent notes and millicent coins.

>Actually it only represents a fraction of what can be traded specifically with that currency and only that much to someone who can do that trading

I meant all money in the world not one particular currency.

>No, that's exactly wrong...

you're going to actually have to explain that. just saying ""you're wrong"" without explaining why doesn't help anything.

"I go further.  The virus spreads to the loan suppliers of fixed assets.  ""we'll give you money for that house"" they say, and then you pay back 3x the original price to service the debt.  But if I save in my deflationary currency, the more the prices get bid up, the higher the value of my deflationary asset goes.

Said it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7aq0fx/lily_allen_turned_down_200k_in_bitcoins_for_a_gig/dpd61ko/), but it applies just as much to this argument.  I think people preferring bitcoin for savings is unavoidable.  I also don't think it is going to be resisted quite as much as people think it will be.  People still need to pay their taxes, and that is not going to stop.  The main thing it is going to do is prick the bubble of consumer debt, and remove the banking middle-men from that space.  That alone is a multi-trillion dollar industry, let alone the annuities that banks own and graft from, from those assets.  Removing these people (i.e. banking debt suppliers) from positions of power, by strangling their access to capital, is a justification for bitcoin in its own right.  Imagine a world in which banks didn't control governments.  

Mostly I think bitcoin will finally separate the good debt from the bad debt. It is my personal belief ( as in i don't know of any formal theory ) that debt should only be incurred for the use of building a productive asset. In a deflationary currency, this encourages businesses to ensure that productivity increases will have greater returns than savings. Instead, our financial system has encouraged the acquisition of debt for fixed assets. The only thing this has done us bid up the price of those fixed debts with debt, and handed over the money for supporting that system to banks and their owners. In order to stimulate growth in such a system, the only way that you can function is to tax savings. That's what inflation is.  What it forces people to do is to invest in increasingly risky assets, because of the loss of their purchasing power.  Hence bubble after bubble after bubble.  Crisis after crisis after crisis.

Bitcoin will eventually stabilize to an ever appreciating value asset. But what it will allow you to do is save for a house. If you have a business proposal that encourages people to pay you for a good or service, people will invest their savings in it and take on that risk.  Banks will instead move back to providing capital to businesses, using savings from people that are willing to invest.  Businesses will again focus on productivity increases, because that's how you get access to capital.

That's the way it is supposed to work i think.  Bitcoin is an antibody vs the parasites of non-productive debt-based instruments.

"Yes. This two-year is term is 0.99%. Last two-year term was 1.5% and the one before that was 2.19%.

Each switch has taken a year off the length of time needed to repay my mortgage for roughly the same amount of monthly outgoings (all three mortgages have been within £20).  

So my 25 year mortgage became a 22 year mortgage after only 2 years. It then became a 19 year mortgage after another 2 years. I'm expecting it to become a 16 year mortgage when it expires in August. That's 9 years of my mortgage done in 6 years.

I pay around £500 per month. Of that money, about £125 is interest. Once out of the introductory period, my payments would rise to around £750 and about £400 of that would be interest.... £400 per month!!

That's why switching every time your mortgage expires is so important. Keep your interest rate as low as possible, even if it means stumping up £1500 every couple of years, and you'll pay your mortgage off far earlier than you would if you stuck with the 1st mortgage you took out..";1;0;False;ChickenGoes2Library;dpfajuk;My BTC, which I've held for only 3 years, are today officially worth more than my 10+ years of investing into my 401(k).;7axesn;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7axesn/my_btc_which_ive_held_for_only_3_years_are_today/

You can have a frangible inflationary currency and a non-frangible deflationary currency. 

There are inflationary cryptocurrencies in existence right now just as frangible as bitcoin.

you could make a crypto currency that was completely infrangible and also a limit of 1 coin if you wanted.

You can't just ignore this and say frangibility = deflation. Subdividing a currency does not increase supply of that currency. How much you can divide up a currency is completely separate from how much currency you can have.

"> because of regulation.

Regulation put in place by the very monopolists that benefit from it, by having laws changed so that only they can function in that environment.

It is but a quibble though.  When there are people it is invariably complex.  That is the beauty of bitcoin.  It directly connects people.   No permission required from government, company, or other third party.

I said this elsewhere recently :

Freedom is hard. Actually requiring probable cause before being subjected to the justice system used to be a thing. Then the US government started stealing peoples money without ever even charging them with a crime. So now we have crypto. So the government can't do it anymore. ""But but but what if they are committing a crime!"" they say. Prove it i say. You know. Rule of law. That's what democracies are supposed to be about aren't they?

And that attack on freedom now has crypto as a response. The thing that it is counter-intuitive about crypto, is that the solution to electronic anonymous and censorship resistant money, turned out being record everything forever.  what kind of genius comes up with that? When someone can flick a switch and take everything from you, you don't have freedom. When you can access the ledger from anyone, prove that it it is valid, and be able to send your money to anyone, for whatever purpose, you do.

This technology has been developed as a direct response to the insidious and anti-democratic implementation of AML/KYC laws on a global scale over the past 30 years. The extrapolation of these laws, given a long enough timeline, is slavery. Not figurative slavery, actual slavery.

you don't care about the price, but you got paid in bitcoin 4 years ago and kept hold of it even when it halved in value for a year, because what you really care about is all the revolutionary opportunities of being able to use a decentralized currency and not the dreams of becoming a multi-millionaire by just sitting on it?

">Jokes on you, I have bitcoin since $400

>I'm not some newcomer who sees the price increase

Bitcoin existed for 4 years before it hit $400 for the first time.

2 weeks before bitcoin hit $400 for the first time it was worth $200. You got in 2 weeks after it had already doubled in price.

If you had sold 2 weeks later, at $979, you could have bought back in at any time in the next 3 years and still have made a profit.

If you wanted to portray yourself as some kind of tech visionary then it would be more impressive if you had bought in at $0.06, rather than after it had already risen 6666x. 

>Are you not reading my message? Transaction count is artificially limited. It couldn't have gone up because the limit has been reached more than 6 months ago. We're in process of fixing that.

"What's your point? It's a bank account you can stick £3k in and earn 3% interest right now.  
  
I got mine before those restrictions were put in place (no minimum deposit, or direct debits required). I also have a 3% Santander account (no longer available) and meet the minimum amount simply by having a standing order put £1000 into the account, then another standing order transfer it out £950 a few days later, I have two direct debits totalling £50 to meet the direct debit requirements.

As soon as the introductory offers expire, my money gets moved to a new one, same with the mortgage. No point leaving it in low paying accounts when switching is so easy and simple.

Edit: And FYI, your mate's loan is a good financial plan, provided he isn't just spending that cash each month (or if his circumstances have changed and he needs that lower outgoing due to financial difficulties). I have a £500 mortgage and £500 goes to savings every month. I've built up £18k in 3 years and that's earning me more than what it would be saving me if I'd paid my mortgage with it.  
  
It also gives me a fall back position. If I'd paid £1000 on my mortgage every month, then lost my job, I'd be struggling to pay it. I've got 3 years of future mortgage payments stacked up.

"> Reread it until it makes sense to you.

I didn't say it doesn't make sense, everything you said about bitcoin being frangible is true. I said it doesn't address what I've said. 

Frangibility has nothing to do with inflation/deflation. Bitcoin could be just as frangible as it is now but inflationary if it simply had no cap on bitcoins and increased supply over time instead of decreased.

You said we needed a deflationary currency like bitcoin to handle asteroid wealth. I pointed out fiat currency can be deflated by taking money out of supply. You replied by saying bitcoin is frangible, I pointed out that fiat currency is also frangible and that frangibility has nothing to do with deflation anyway.

>Right. But you can't make a 21.000000000000000001 million bitcoin coin.

Which is why its deflationary. What's your point? The limit on the supply of bitcoins is what makes it deflationary, not the frangibility.

"Well it's true, but equally it's worth noting that there's a minimum fee at any given time (albeit one that varies over time) even for non-urgent transactions.

But yeah, I think it's best explained to newbies as being a ""per transaction"" fee, where you have a minimum to actually get the transaction through the system, and then can add to it for a faster transaction.

This makes more logical sense than the one sometimes put forward of ""If it's less urgent, pay less"", because the fees don't usually scale to zero - the mempool has only been <1MB once this month, and close once. There's rather a fluctuating minimum recommended fee for inclusion in a sensible number of blocks, and then you can increase that for urgent transactions

But yeah, the ""It's per transaction"" is the first step to understanding. Then understanding how the number of input/output addresses is the next: the only analogy that I've found works is if you explain it like cash, and the fee is ""per coin/note"". Eg if you pay for $10 worth of stuff with a $10 bill, the fee is lower. If you pay with 10x $1 bills, it's higher. This is counter-intuitive to most people used to dealing with cash or credit cards, so explaining the way it's ""You're paying for space in the block, and your transaction has to include where the money comes from (the coins from our analogy) to be valid"" is usually the last step, I've found most people ""get"" it after that";2;1;False;audigex;dpenjvi;My BTC, which I've held for only 3 years, are today officially worth more than my 10+ years of investing into my 401(k).;7axesn;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7axesn/my_btc_which_ive_held_for_only_3_years_are_today/

"If it helps your sleep...

- There's hindsight bias here. Bitcoin was a risk, and you just happen to live in the, uh, universe where it spiked. It had an equal if not much greater chance of failing, whether through legislation, geopolitics, technology, etc.

- Even if you did buy it then, it's unlikely that you held this long. You might have sold at 330 or 400. Nearly everybody sells too early on stuff like this, if they don't lose the money first.

Well there is only a vesting period if they match...so confused by that comment. And as for the limit that multiplied by the amount of years you work is quite a good amount of money.  In addition, if the company doesn't match then the eventually lose good employees as a good employee will find a company all others equal with better benefits.  I've gone from an employer matching 3%, to 4%, to my current employer matching 6%.  In the industry I'm in there is a better company but they only provide 6% if you contribute 8%, plus my company has unlimited PTO, so the benefits currently outweigh the negatives.  It's all perspective, but at the end of the day nobody forces you to work somewhere if they don't have the benefits you like go elsewhere, they'll get the message when the can't retain talented people.;1;0;False;JesC929;dpejyzg;My BTC, which I've held for only 3 years, are today officially worth more than my 10+ years of investing into my 401(k).;7axesn;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7axesn/my_btc_which_ive_held_for_only_3_years_are_today/
I'm saying that they can provide you a pension plan, but if the company goes out of business you get jack squat and then you'd be wishing you had a 401K.  It's not always greed.  If you think of the cost an average employee costs a company, and if companies had to contribute to pension plans for all these years after retirement and how much longer people are living, they eventually wouldn't be able to continue paying their current employees higher salaries, and eventually would go out of business.  I've work in finance and accounting at 4 different Fortune 500 companies, and worked on these specific benefits at 3 of the 4, and the decisions that have to be made on benefits and perks at a company would blow your mind.  Before you blame it all on corporate greed, which I'm not saying that there aren't companies out there like that, in my experience it's not that greedy when you factor in the amount of money that you cost your company and how much money they contribute to every employee between retirement, insurance, vacation, workers comp, and other various benefits they offer.  I think if you owned your own business and really sat in front of the numbers you'd really realize how fortunate you are to have a corporation give you anything, because I've worked for some that just couldn't afford to give out anything but they are minimum. ;1;1;False;JesC929;dpel4f5;My BTC, which I've held for only 3 years, are today officially worth more than my 10+ years of investing into my 401(k).;7axesn;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7axesn/my_btc_which_ive_held_for_only_3_years_are_today/

Well actually 401Ks are MUCH safer than previous pension plans you're referring to, as pension plans disappear after a company disappears and A LOT of pension plans are underfunded to begin with, which leaves you with nothing in retirement.  401Ks on the other hand is your money, you don't have to contribute, they give you the option and most companies match a pretty solid percent which is like making extra pay for saving your own money.  And as for the penalty the companies don't penalize you, the Govt does as an incentive to keep folks from pulling their money out, and it's only 10% on top of your income tax, as a way to hopefully help people have extra retirement income when they get older.;1;1;False;JesC929;dpeizvo;My BTC, which I've held for only 3 years, are today officially worth more than my 10+ years of investing into my 401(k).;7axesn;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7axesn/my_btc_which_ive_held_for_only_3_years_are_today/

The value now is pre mass adoption *and that's only in the first world.* Can you imagine anyone in a poor country that wouldn't want bitcoin when they can accumulate it and use it to buy things that aren't even available in their countries or exchange for the currency of a nation they want to live in someday and dream of sending their kids to?;3;0;False;DeucesCracked;dpf1nba;My BTC, which I've held for only 3 years, are today officially worth more than my 10+ years of investing into my 401(k).;7axesn;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7axesn/my_btc_which_ive_held_for_only_3_years_are_today/
"Risk is primarily measure with volatility. The reason is that it is a mathematical tool. In case of a legal dispute is super clear that the advisor used a neutral tool which, with the information given at that time, was objectively.

At the beginning you need to declare your risk affinity. If you say low and they give you bitcoin they got a problem. If they recommend a sure bet which will rise but is super volatile they will not do it. With a matematical tool you have a super easy way to prove that you gave neutral informations about the asset according to the wishes of the customer.

For the highest risk classes you need to sign special documents to prove you know and understand what you are doing. For CFD with possible looses larger than 100% you need even more signatures and with CFD high risk/leverage you need to proof further experience.

**In short**: Its mostly about liability and volatility is king (analysists statements not so much)

What I wonder is what will happen when bitcoin goes to the CFD shortly. Bitcoin is not regulated, and price manipulation is legal. But CFD is clearly regulated and inside trading strictly forbidden - no idea how they think this will fit together.

"How could the supply of Bitcoin be adjusted better than a central bank can adjust the amount of fiat currency?

If a government wants to increase the money supply they can print as much money as they want, and if they want to decrease it they can start pulling money (and debt) out of circulation.

Banks could half the amount of money in supply over night if they wanted to, thanks to fractional reserve.

It's impossible to do that with Bitcoin. You would either have to stop mining completely (which would crash the price because it requires mining to operate), or else mine all the coins and then wait for people to slowly lose half the coins in supply.

>If they're bringing back more value than Earth has every seen wouldn't they need a currency that can automatically deflate to cover it? How else could they ever sell it...?

That's the opposite of what you would want to happen.

Money is simply a token of wealth. Each unit of money represents a tiny portion of all the wealth in the world. The more wealth you have the more money you need to represent it.

If the amount of wealth increases without a corresponding increase in the supply of money then the value of money will increase, and vice versa.

Trillions of dollars of wealth flooding the economy would cause a massive surge in the value of the dollar unless there was a corresponding increase in supply of currency.

Bitcoiners seem to have a very naive perspective that if money being worth more is somehow inherently better. The amount of money in the world does not change the amount of wealth in the world, it just changes what portion is represented by each token.";1;1;False;suninabox;dpfcmi8;My BTC, which I've held for only 3 years, are today officially worth more than my 10+ years of investing into my 401(k).;7axesn;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7axesn/my_btc_which_ive_held_for_only_3_years_are_today/

"From ideological perspective a virus can be viewed as form of inoculation sure.

Bitcoin causes its host to gain value to a point where the coin is harder to spend than it is to hold. As its value continues to increase the virus spreads to others. in turn those people find it difficult to spend the coins as well and thus hold them. This causes the value to increase more causing more attention toward the coin spreads the virus further.

Imagine Gollum from Lord of the rings holding his precious bitcoins. The eventual landscape will be thousands and thousands of Gollums who are multimillionaires afraid to spend a single dime of their coin.

"Increasing or decreasing the amount of currency is not relevant nor would it be an answer. But bitcoin is infinitely frangible. In other words, if the entire world economy were in bitcoin then bitcoin would be worth about $107 trillion dollars. $4761904.76 per bitcoin. About 0.047 cents per Satoshi. Want to buy something worth 1 penny? Make a transaction for 1/5th of a Satoshi. Change is already made in millisatoshi. Get it? You can keep dividing it down infinitely.

> Each unit of money represents a tiny portion of all the wealth in the world.

Actually it only represents a fraction of what can be traded specifically with that currency and only that much to someone who can do that trading. For example SA money is worthless to me despite being valuable to citizens of SA because I cannot travel there as I've been to Israel and prefer to keep my head attached to my neck.

> The more wealth you have the more money you need to represent it.

No, that's exactly wrong...

> If the amount of wealth increases without a corresponding increase in the supply of money then the value of money will increase

... and that's why. Even though it's not a complete accurate truth, you do seem to understand the fundamentals.

> it just changes what portion is represented by each token.

Right, if that currency is totally honest and transparent. And that's why having a completely frangible token is a good thing.
