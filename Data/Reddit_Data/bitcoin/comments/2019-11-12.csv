"So refining gold for use in electronics or jewelry is the same as the hardware to run btc.  Yet gold bugs claim that it can be made into jewelry gives it intrinsic value.

I mean, trying to compare apple to apples. Using your example then nothing has intrinsic value but wildly found  fruit/veg and water because it didnt require any human internevtion to give it value?  Even then, the human has to drink it or eat it.

"I differentiate between Schiff and the modern GOP because the former seems to be acting in good faith. Right or wrong, it's at least *plausible* that Peter endorses policies that he thinks are best for the country. To the extent that he rejects entitlements spending, I suspect it's because he believes it's unsustainable.

It's my impression that Schiff is a single-issue guy. He hates inflation & deficit spending and doesn't really care how they're curtailed. Unlike the typical Republican, Peter advocates shrinking the defense budget, for example. He doesn't claim that tax cuts will pay for themselves. He doesn't lie or prevaricate or adopt politically expedient positions. The man can be reasoned with.

A [two-party] political system depends upon compromise between honest actors across the political spectrum. That's why I find myself supporting such disparate voices as Peter Schiff and AOC. Unfortunately, we find ourselves choosing between a conservative party that's wholly compromised and liberal one that's just *mostly* corrupt. Peter Schiff is one of the only conservative pundits who's not a transparent con-man. Is it fair to grade on a curve?

I agree that there are many ways to improve the plight of the 99%. Any system that fails to do so is a non-starter in my mind. I just don't feel that anti-Schiff liberals (the Sanders crowd?) pay adequate heed to the efficiency of their preferred solution. People are too busy being outraged to care about the underlying economics.

Some of the heartless stuff Peter Schiff says gets misinterpreted. For example, I doubt he thinks special-needs employees should be left to fend for themselves on $2/hour. Obviously, the government or some other entity would need to help make ends meet. I took his point to be that there's not a huge market for mentally challenged staff at the federally mandated minimum wage. By allowing the market to dictate salary, more people will be able to do something fulfilling and productive.

Businesses are good at generating wealth while government programs are good for helping people. To the extent that we can separate the two mandates, we ought to.";1;0;False;hwaite;f7a6mi9;Oh Peter.....;dudhjo;https://i.redd.it/h1ltbc29xvx31.png
">From a security standpoint, he’s not talking about someone guessing the private key. He’s talking about securing your word seed. That’s what he means by definitely not 100% secure. Someone breaking into your house, and breaching your safe is all it would take for you to lose your wealth.  That’s his point.

Then he does not know how to secure bitcoin properly.

If you write down the 12 word and put them into the safe, yes, that's easy for the thieves.

That's why we have 12 words + optional password(s!) as plausible deniability. Thief will unload the bitcoins of the wallet ""12 words w/o passwd"" swiftly. This gives you enough time to xfer the bitcoins of ""12 words + password"" to a safe new wallet.";1;0;False;Amichateur;f7a8cp7;Oh Peter.....;dudhjo;https://i.redd.it/h1ltbc29xvx31.png

"The implications of Bitcoin dissapearing tomorrow would be mostly the loss of thousands of jobs and revenue in the surrounding infrastructure space. I'm referring to mining operations, chipset and hardware manufacturing for mining technology, countless employees of exchanges and platforms for investment, hardware and software manufacturers of cold storage wallets such as Ledger Nano or Trezor, thousands of content creators on digital learning around bitcoin on countless social media channels, and even university courses, authors of books, programmers, thrid part app creators, and that's just off the top of my head. 

In terms of future growth there's the same implications as there are if things like 3D printing, space travel to Mars, gene editing, and quantum computing dissapeared I suppose.

Lastly, bitcoin IS blockchain. Despite the sensationalized information floating around out there, the blockchain conversation would be mute if there was no Bitcoin. Since you seem very restricted to current state of development, to this date there is no other productive use of blockchain outside of Bitcoin. In fact, many experienced developers strongly believe that there will never be a better use of blockchain than Bitcoin.";1;0;False;cryptogrip;f7aesex;Oh Peter.....;dudhjo;https://i.redd.it/h1ltbc29xvx31.png

"How does securing your bitcoins protect you against torture to give up your bitcoins? For someone with enough money it might actually be preferable to not have complete control over it, as that would protect them somewhat against this attack.

And you think a passphrase protects you against every single attack vector? Do you seriously think it's literally impossible to get a passphrase from someone? All I'd have to do is to actually watch you type it one way or another.

Security is also not only about defending yourself against adversaries. What if you hit your head and forget your passphrase? Your bitcoins were secure enough against theft but not against accidental loss.

"The difference between losing 100% and 99% is 1% of a fraction of an amount you normally could afford to lose, in other words, it's nothing.
Volatility isn't an intrinsic property. As a store of value bitcoin has way better properties than gold, the fact that it currently isn't used as much as gold for that purpose only means it has more potential to go up in value.
My point being, why wouldn't you buy something ""worth its price"" + a good SOV/MOE, rather than some half-assed hybrid that neither has that much intrinsic value, nor can compete with crypto as a value standard (again, think intrinsic properties).";2;1;False;adrien_zozor;f7akwl0;Oh Peter.....;dudhjo;https://i.redd.it/h1ltbc29xvx31.png
