"To answer your question are you referring to Robinhood or Coinbase? Robinhood makes money off the interest earned from uninvested funds in a customer's account.

For example. If you deposit $500 and buy $400 worth of stock, they'll earn interest of the remaining $100 in your account. Also, any dividends paid will be added to your account balance - earning interest for them.";3;0;False;BeforeYourBBQ;dtodq33;Thank you Coinbase!!

I think the whole point is actually thanking coinbase in this case. I originally misread it and thought he was being sarcastic, but he really is thanking them.

"**Federal savings association**

Federal savings associations (also called ""federal thrifts"" or ""federal Savings Banks""), in the United States, are institutions chartered by the Office of Thrift Supervision which is now administered by Office of the Comptroller of the Currency after the agencies merged. Institutions chartered by the OTS are still regulated according to the rules and regulations of Federal Savings Banks. Mortgages issued by Federal Savings Banks are pursuant to the provisions of the Home Owners' Loan Act, a U.S. federal statute. Although the activities of federal thrifts were once confined primarily to taking deposits from consumers and making residential mortgage loans, federal thrifts are now authorized to offer a wide range of financial products and services.

"I have been reading about exchanging sites. all of them have people who lost their money due to hacks, or investors got their accounts closed, frozen (Coindesk) without proper explanations, usually exchange sites let them deposit money, but they don't let them withdraw their money.

Kraken(some review sites list this is as one of the best exchange site, what a joke) is also a shit hole, the same thing, money and coins missing, buggy laggy website, no customer support.

How do you make money of cryptocurrency when the exchange sites are predators to hunt people's money? Decentralized trade sites maybe? If I read positive reviews about these centralized exchange sites , they doesn't seem genuine at all, most of the time, it looks like someone ordered them from Fiverr. Binance, Bitfinex with the Tether fiasco, Coinmama.... All of them looks like scummy attempt to get your money.

"I've given up on getting Coinbase to work. I use Bank of America, and they make you give your account a ""nickname"" (which can be your actual name, but it can't have any spaces.)  
Coinbase can't figure this out.  
I kept getting emails every time I tried to use Coinbase that said ""your account has been disabled because the name on your bank account, ""JohnMSmith"" does not match our records of ""John M. Smith.""  
*Multiple* hour long calls over the period of a month, and they still haven't been able to make it work.  
I *think* that they've given up, but I'm *positive* that I have.  

Edit: on the other hand, when I signed up for Robinhood the other day, the input field said ""nickname on your bank account?"", and the entire sign-up process took me 3 minutes, and instantly started working without a hitch.";1;0;False;yourbrotherrex;dtom189;Thank you Coinbase!!

I kept receiving an error when attempting to upload the Tier 3 verification documents with Kraken. I spent a total of 3 months with Kraken support and the only other method they offered was to email the documents to them. No other method to upload the files individually, couldn't accept a password protected archive (i.e. zip) of the files, nothing but individual files. No way was I going to send enough personal information for someone to commit identity fraud via non-secure email let alone entrust my financial information with them.

"Cancelled my account, said I violated the terms of agreement. Gave me just minutes to find  a place to transfer my btc and eth. This came as a massive shock to me since the only thing I ever did with my account is buy a couple thousand dollars worth of coins. Emailed them over and over asking for an explanation and never got shit. Now I keep all my crypto in a free wallet called Exodus. It's companies like CoinBase and Kraken that give crypto a bad name. I will never under any circumstances ever do any business with them ever. Use RobinHood app instead. They have a good rep and are commission free. Their crypto app isn't out yet but they have a good rep from ppl that use them for stock trades.

No, it's just that no one else really handled the traffic better. When Coinbase started having trouble, this sub told everyone to go to Gemini. Take a guess what happened then. The exchanges didn't have a chance. No one was prepared for this thing to go viral the way it did. Now, as things die off, we'll see some normalcy return. Also, to OP, if you waited until freaking November or December of 2017 to join in the fun, I can't feel sorry for you missing out.

">The crypto community are brain washed to hold but that doesn't mean its the right move. 

Likewise,  just because you can put some fiat profit in your pocket doesn't mean it's the right move either.

People who hold are not brainwashed, it's just been a pretty decent strategy historically.  There will only ever be 21 million BTC, less if you consider how many are lost/locked.

Timing the market isn't always easy.  I've tried to hop out with profit and hop back in after a pullback.  I botched the timing, and now will never own the amount of BTC I once did and I also triggered a tax event which further ate into my profits.  The price ran away on me.  I gained some fiat profits, I ultimately lost BTC I can never get back.

How big of loss (or lost opportunity) is it to hold LESS bitcoin than you previously would have, is yet to be determined.    This market can do crazy things, and it usually does them quick with sentiment reversing on a dime.

I'm not knocking your strategy.  To each their own, but just a glimpse of another perspective.   Everyone has different goals.  I'm pessimistic on fiat and it's future.  I realized my mistake as soon as I took profits on what I thought was a correction and the dip never came.  I've got fiat, I earn more every day, but I can likely never afford to buy back the BTC, ETH, LTC, XMR, etc that I once held.  If you take profits early and ultimately have to buy back in at a higher price, are they really profits?  Your strategy assumes you'll always be taking profits at the right time and catching a correction properly.

Congrats if you can do that - boat loads can't - which is why they now HOLD.  Only takes one mistake to erase a whole lot of previous profits (and unfortunately the IRS doesn't look at it that way).  You also have to pretty much keep your coins on an exchange to play your strategy as I assume it involves the use of stop losses.  That in itself is risky.


Best of luck.  Be careful out there.  I've taken ""profits"" while simultaneously wrecking myself in the larger picture.

"Oh.  If see what you’re saying, kinda. 

But the error you’re making — and why I didn’t follow your logic from the start — is because none of what you describe as being learned from observation cannot be learned without observation.

For example, there are four aces in a deck of 52.  The odds of me getting one is therefore 1-in-13.  There are now three aces left in a deck of 51 and therefore the odds of the second card also being an ace are 1-in-17.  For both actions to occur:

(52/4) * (51/3) = 221

So the odds for being dealt pocket aces are 1-in-221.  No need to consider past hands to derive this information. In fact, as you point out, your observation method will yield some degree of error which will asymptotically approach zero as sample size reaches infinity while the deduction method is precise and requires no hand collection or analysis.

The obvious conclusion is that a method which requires more work AND yields less accuracy should never be used.

I can’t think of anything in poker which could be determined by an examination of past hands which couldn’t also be determined *without* an examination of past hands (outside of player tendencies).";1;1;False;bodhisoma;dtovh21;Lesson - History of Bitcoin crashes;7uqa54;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7uqa54/lesson_history_of_bitcoin_crashes/

">You’re telling me that bitcoin billionaires will have more combined wealth in bitcoin than the aggregate GDP of the world?

It's generally misleading to compare wealth (a static value) to GDP (the increase in that value over time). The total wealth of the world is much, much higher than its GDP. That being said...

The market cap of bitcoin is a measure of the current price * the total number of bitcoins - it doesn't reflect the actual wealth of its owners. The majority of coins were sold at much lower prices (or have never been sold), so the total amount invested in btc is much lower, approx 10 billion. Given the actions of price manipulators, it's possible for the price to rise substantially with no actual coins being sold at all.

On the plus side, this means that there's effectively no hard limit to how high bitcoin's price can rise. So long as people aren't willing to cash out (le epic hodl) it can just keep on increasing.

On the down side, it means that people are *vastly* over-estimating how much money they will plausibly be able to take out of bitcoin. They are treating their current slice of the market cap like a reliable and liquid asset, when it's neither. It is mathematically impossible for most people to walk away from this with anything close to the amount of money they think they have.

I am saying that regardless of player tendencies, past hands give information about future hands.

To demonstrate it very simply: just look only at your opening hand, then count how many times you get one or more aces and how many times opening hands you investigated. Then divide the former quantity with the latter, that yields an estimation of the probability of having one or more aces in your opening hand.

""It's not hard to imagine that under certain circumstances, investors or traders can easily fall prey to the gambler's fallacy.

Conversely, other investors might hold on to a stock that has fallen in multiple sessions because they view further declines as ""improbable"".

"If you’re talking about opponent’s actions, yes.  If I see someone open 100% and cbet flops 100% over the last 100 hands, I can calculate my range against theirs.  But that’s an inference about player habits, not card distribution.

This could be extended further by taking the cards remaining minus the cards I hold (or have seen mucked) and applying card elimination to calculate the odds of cards to come.  For example, if someone is opening and cbetting any two, nothing could be eliminated, but if their range is narrower (an extreme example might be opening/cbettng only AA/KK), the remaining deck is far less likely to have these cards.

If that’s what you’re saying, also correct.

But if you’re saying future cards can be better predicted by past experience — without consideration of a player’s range in a given spot — other than accounting for known cards, that’d be incorrect.

To think that bitcoin MUST behave like a stock 100% is also a mistake. If a company loses 90% of their market value, they close their door and it ceases to exist.

That doesn't happen with btc for example.

You basically hit the nail on the head with your reasoning. Banking and government are too intertwined, there is no separate entity and the powerful banks who control the government do not share any of the societal risk or downside with their practice any longer. When the economy tanks because of poor (and downright illegal) banking practices only focused on short term profits they are then subsequently bailed out by taxpayer dollars, rising inflation, and even outright theft of deposits in some countries. Right now we have technology to mitigate central banks abuse of power by removing authority from our commerce. Therefore if the banks decide to be reckless with their Bitcoin (or whatever the future ends up using) then there will be no one to bail them out, and society can move from a failed bank rather than a now larger consolidated one using the same risky practices that is now too big to fail in the next cycle.;3;0;False;stablecoin;dtnjbh7;Lesson - History of Bitcoin crashes;7uqa54;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7uqa54/lesson_history_of_bitcoin_crashes/

I'm having trouble reconciling these two statements.  Help me out here.

And your thoughts regarding my primary issue would be nice, too.  What would be a reasonable valuation for the Cryptocurrency market (or Bitcoin) *compared to that of gold?*  Because I'm aware that bitcoin and gold are different.  However, they have similarities, namely as a store of value and a financial commodity.  And considering that a hard drive full of bitcoin doesn't have the same utility (I can't melt bitcoin into jewelry, or squish it into thin sheets that protect things from radiation), I would like a challenge that any valuation of crypto over gold isn't erroneous.  I ask, because I don't know.

Context:  I work with grey-bearded economists who believe that bitcoin is pretty much fictitious, more so than tulips and Beanie Babies.  I've also heard that the only use for Bitcoin is criminal activity.  I understand the arguments, but I see a ton of value and demand for decentralized, nationless currency.  However, what is a reasonable value?  What are some things that are similar in value to Bitcoin?  That's what I'm trying to get across here.

Digital blockchain assets are a new class but in the case of Bitcoin we look to gold for some signs. It differs in that it has more utility than gold as it is unseizable, easily transferrable, and easily accessible with any number of devices connected to the internet anywhere in the world. The gold market cap is worth about 7 trillion, and the offshore banking industry (quick google search is 10% worldwide GDP). It is reasonable to estimate that in just those two use cases alone Bitcoin could chip away at some market cap of gold and off-shore banking. Even more if Bitcoin becomes a commonly accepted currency which developments are already underway to speed up and reduce transaction fees, making them more convenient for smaller purchases. 50K-70K per Bitcoin puts it about 1/5th the size of gold market cap, and it almost got there on the last run-up. After that you'd need to see serious use case of digital currency and evidence of people hiding their money from taxation to start serious growth.;2;0;False;stablecoin;dtnl262;Lesson - History of Bitcoin crashes;7uqa54;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7uqa54/lesson_history_of_bitcoin_crashes/

"The first mover advantage works well for companies that capitalize on it and further expand to Even for companies that were “too big to fail” in a budding industry，ie. Blockbuster，AOL，etc. can fuck up and they did. Bitcoin is no different in terms of its vulnerabilities to innovations since it began as an unrefined consensus algorithm and grew over the years. but it has limitations set by its original structure that makes it hard to future-proof despite all the talented devs working on it. They are also not incentivized by a paying employer, only probably by their own stakes in bitcoin and also maybe blind faith in what’s become almost a cult. If you ask me that’s not very sustainable, because their goals and motivations could change at any moment. Recent flip flopping of core devs on important issues kind of shows that some of them have no idea what they are doing. 

NOW, I am by no means advocating for bitcoin cash or BCash as this sub likes to call it. I am simply stating the fact that this time things are slightly different than previous bitcoin “crashes”, because an unprecedented amount of global media coverage and publicity in the last few months have brought more than just bitcoin into the spotlight once again, and it’s bitcoin’s competitors. I don’t believe any of them will replace bitcoin, most of them aren’t designed to do so. But many ARE designed to dominate more specific sub markets with their innovation and utility. Eventually we will see micro-economies using different crypto currencies, using ones that make the most sense for the specific application. And bitcoin money will flow into these Alts like we’ve been seeing already. 

So where does that leave bitcoin? Well sadly without slightly commercializing or “centralizing” bitcoin, it is really up to the community of hodlers to prop up the value of bitcoin. But most hodlers will jump ship if enough evidence presents itself, eg. core devs giving up on bitcoin development. Without organizations working on the technology and improving it, we are just leaving our fates in the hands of internet strangers and hodlers. Sure there are bitcoin related businesses but they do not depend on the success of bitcoin. Satoshipay dropping bitcoin and switching to Stellar network due to bitcoin fees and speed is a prime example. 
Businesses can bank on the success of bitcoin without relying on the success of bitcoin. Bitmain is another example, they bring in massive profits due to the success of bitcoin but we all know they do not give two shits about the future of bitcoin and their repeated efforts to undermine it while profiting from bch pumps shows that. That’s why we have never seen any of these businesses give back to the bitcoin community to help spread adoption or support development, because they do not care. 

So what am I getting at? At the end of the day it’s YOU the community that give bitcoin it’s value, if more people choose to adopt bitcoin then its value will grow. But a lot of of those people will undoubtedly stumble upon alternative crypto as they dig deeper and most likely diversify, or abandon bitcoin altogether. Because right now it’s not true adoption, it’s swarm after swarm of people trying to double their money in a few weeks and then gtfo. If this sub is obsessed with the price and price memes, then those are the types of people it will attract. If this sub fostered more technical discussions and less bashing of other competing crypto and techs, it will attract developers and likeminded people who may one day even contribute to core. 

Bitcoin millionaires of this sub, instead of worrying about your dwindling btc stack why not donate to fund second layer solutions of bitcoin? If bitcoin gave you your massive wealth then doesn’t it make sense to give back a little since it will also help sustain your wealth? 

A few things to consider for you rich bastards - 

Lightning network development is still incomplete, 

Other methods of offchain scaling to be explored

Segwit adoption can be sped up using monetary incentives

Creating fungible tokens on bitcoin blockchain and smart contract capabilities

The point is we shouldn’t be telling the sub not to worry, we should be educating each other on WHY we should worry and what we can do to help bring solutions. Just solely relying on the “authenticity” of bitcoin is not gonna get us very far...

You can say we are wrong, and that bitcoin will never be used as a currency, but saying it can never be a currency because it isn't typically used as one now because it is a speculative asset is not true.

You misunderstand and severely underestimate the importance of bitcoin as the original implementation of Nakamodo Consensus when your comparison is companies and first mover advantage. Bitcoin is a protocol for measurement, like the  imperial system (which goes back thousands of years) and the metric system (which goes back hundreds of years). At the same time it is the original and most valuable implementation of a new asset class. In this way it is comparable to gold, which has been a valuable store of wealth since before writing was invented. Even when gold has been too rare to be utilized in daily transactions, and iron and copper coins were minted by trusted parties like kings and merchants, it still held it's value. There are all kinds of things that have been or could be used as money.

"**Focal point (game theory)**

In game theory, a focal point (also called Schelling point) is a solution that people will tend to use in the absence of communication, because it seems natural, special, or relevant to them. The concept was introduced by the Nobel Memorial Prize-winning American economist Thomas Schelling in his book The Strategy of Conflict (1960). In this book (at p. 57), Schelling describes ""focal point[s] for each person’s expectation of what the other expects him to expect to be expected to do"".

**Public-key cryptography**

Public key cryptography, or asymmetrical cryptography, is any cryptographic system that uses pairs of keys: public keys which may be disseminated widely, and private keys which are known only to the owner. This accomplishes two functions: authentication, where the public key verifies a holder of the paired private key sent the message, and encryption, where only the paired private key holder can decrypt the message encrypted with the public key.

In a public key encryption system, any person can encrypt a message using the receiver's public key. That encrypted message can only be decrypted with the receiver's private key.

">history has not fared well to new comers to markets before and new comers cannot demand authenticity or market authority.

Bitcoin is not a company though. It is a protocol for storing, measuring, and exchanging value. So, this is not a matter of first mover advantage, as many people mistakenly believe. And it is not primarily a function of network effect either, although this is a necessary secondary and reinforcing factor. 

The importance of bitcoin being the original implementation of the invention that make cryptocurrencies possible is a matter of game theory more than anything else. Bitcoins represent the [Schelling Point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_point_\(game_theory\)) for value storage among this new asset class (and possibly among all assets, to a degree, but if that ends up being true the world will change in ways we can not imagine).

>Also I did not fully understand what you meant by “made digital scarcity possible” would be great if you could elaborate on this a little further.

Before bitcoin the idea of something being digital and scarce seemed like an impossible combination. How can something digital be scarce when it can easily be copied millions of times over? Satoshi's brilliant invention created a way for digital scarcity to be functionally implemented, by creating an immutable distributed ledger utilizing [public key cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography), where the tokens can be moved to new public adresses by the controller of the private key, but never duplicated.

"**Kelly criterion**

In probability theory and intertemporal portfolio choice, the Kelly criterion, Kelly strategy, Kelly formula, or Kelly bet is a formula used to determine the optimal size of a series of bets in order to maximise the logarithm of wealth. In most gambling scenarios, and some investing scenarios under some simplifying assumptions, the Kelly strategy will do better than any essentially different strategy in the long run (that is, over a span of time in which the observed fraction of bets that are successful equals the probability that any given bet will be successful). It was described by J. L. Kelly, Jr, a researcher at Bell Labs, in 1956. The practical use of the formula has been demonstrated.

So, yes, everybody can rule out 2m, because the society would not allow that. Even 200k is out of the question, unless bitcoin somehow changes its energy consumption.

If you understand economic relations, consider that, one way or another, bitcoin users pay for the total mining effort.

The main reasons to foresee the end of the rise were its steepness and the fact that I could hardly find any reason on Reddit or elsewhere. People were outright crazy. I saw only an outsized crypto-hype. Most people seemed to believe that the price will keep going up, that it can only go up. I saw people ""investing"" with borrowed money. I saw people squandering their family savings and their savings for old age. Friends, colleagues, and their mothers asked for bitcoin. On Reddit any voice of reason was immediately downvoted into oblivion. That, among other considerations, made me sell.

I could not see anybody mention the [Kelly criterion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion), which every good investor knows. But I did see lots of idiotic advice, pandering to each and every well-known bias and flaw of the human brain's rational thinking.

Hint: Read Daniel Kahneman: ""Thinking, Fast and Slow"". An extremely abbreviated version is [here on Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rosspomeroy/2014/02/11/10-common-flaws-with-how-we-think/), but do not believe for a moment that this article replaces reading the book.

I think we are currently in the denial phase, and I foresee a further decline down to below $5,000, and I cannot even rule out $1,000. I think the bust will last 6 months at the very least, and it could be years. Again there is always some margin of error, not least because of unforeseeable external events.

I was not lucky. I lost a lot to MtGox, because at that time I stupidly did not extend the application of the [Kelly criterion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion) to exchanges, partly because there were not many beside MtGox. Today I would say, I was over-exposed to MtGox. At least I learned the lesson.";1;2;False;hgmichna;dto5l1t;Hodlers currently;7un2db;https://v.redd.it/trltwla1sod01

"In my case that is patently untrue. I believe bitcoin is a solid currency and it may turn out to be the foundation of highly usable second-layer systems. Or perhaps some other cryptocurrency will be developed that is better than bitcoin.

Consider that I originally bought bitcoin out of curiosity and later to transfer money across borders. I reguarly travel between Europe and Africa, and I have taken to financing my Africa travels entirely with bitcoin, which has so far worked exceedingly well and saved me quite a bit of money and time. I am first and foremost a bitcoin user, rather than a bitcoin investor. And I have learned that, contrary to what you wrote, bitcoin is a good and functional currency.

I do see that bitcoin can be used to save, independently of unreliable banks and fiat currencies. At the moment the high volatility makes this a bit questionable, but as long as the long-term price trend is up, it works quite well and the savings even yield a little unintended profit on the side.

I also have become a little bit of a slow trader, seeing that some people cause crazy price fluctuations, against which I bet. But that has never been my primary objective. It kind of fell into my lap.";1;0;False;hgmichna;dto5tz5;Hodlers currently;7un2db;https://v.redd.it/trltwla1sod01
"Well done.

Now the interesting question is whether and when bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies (which ones?) will recover. My prediction is that it will take at least 6 months to reach bottom and that it could take a year or longer.

But generally I think that cryptocurrencies will not go away. They are useful and will become a permanent part of our society. They may even turn out to be the harbinger of a larger revolution and change our society dramatically, but at the moment I will not bet on it.";1;1;False;hgmichna;dto5yme;Hodlers currently;7un2db;https://v.redd.it/trltwla1sod01
