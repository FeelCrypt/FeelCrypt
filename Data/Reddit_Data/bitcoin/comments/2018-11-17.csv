"First, I'm still not sure now this makes an argument against changing society to be more libertarian.  These conditions exist now.  It sounds like you are more upset with the free market than all freedom in general.

There is nothing stopping you and others like you from donating money to people less fortunate than you.  We do it all the time.  The capital that we own gives us the freedom to help others.

Who knows what these people might do with their time if give the opportunity of doing anything?  The hurdles of starting your own business and the regulatory maze make it all but impossible for someone with no education and living paycheck to paycheck to even try.

There are people who are not able to contribute more than minimum wage to society (sometimes less) and it sucks for them to be stuck in a society that has advanced past them.  Their last of education or upbringing or whatever keeps them from contributing more.

They can be helped in a number of ways, but preventing then from getting jobs because you close down their employer isn't helpful.  Closing all the places that they might work because it doesn't pay enough is a great way to speed the automation of menial tasks.  That is great for society as a whole, but leaves them even further behind than they are now.

What you are looking for is better income distribution.  It is true that a pure libertarian society night dismiss things like minimum wage and tax distribution, but nothing is ever pure.  Taxation is theft in the eyes of the person being taxed involuntarily.  But some of us accept it as a reasonable theft.  I don't like the idea of stealing from others to pay for my ideas, but nothing is ever perfect.

Personally I would like to consider something like a UBI to help with the distribution of wealth as more and more people drop off from being able to contribute more to society.  The more we automate the more the capital accumulates and UBI is one way to redistribute that wealth.  This is more of an economical perspective and less a pure libertarian one.

But claiming that poor existing conditions are a reason why we shouldn't consider changing society to something different seems counter productive.

"> This extremely vague

All political philosophies start with vague platitudes, and those are refined through argument, debate, and into implementation of policy. Liberalism starts with the vague platitude of individual freedoms, freedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom of religious practice. Every one of the presuppositions needs to be challenged to be able to form policy, that's not unique to libertarians.

Freedom of speech being a principle, the challenge of 'should people be free to incite violence through speech' is something that needs to be reconciled. Violent assault is a violation of an individual's rights, so inciting violence through speech is a violation of the rights of the victim. Coming to the conclusion that the state should protect its citizens against the incitement of violence through speech is perfectly in line with both principles.

"> Everything you described as within the realm of what the libertarian system would include still sounds like it would need something quite big and powerful to exist, and likely one that would require resources beyond what could be voluntarily fund-raised.

First off, my post doesn't actually do much to describe policies that would fall within the realm of libertarianism. It largely only pointed out things that you claimed were libertarian aren't. So it seems hard to believe that anyone would see all the libertarian policies I described and think they require a big, powerful agency with lots of resources. I'm guessing that what you mean here is ""I've heard libertarians describe how they'd implement their solutions to social ills and they seem like they'd require something big and powerful with more resources than they could raise voluntarily.""

Well, fair enough. Your estimation of how much power and what resources they would require are presumably different from libertarians'. Feel free to make your arguments to that end or rebut libertarians' arguments about the level of power and resources required.

> Somehow - like via some sort of government? Or perhaps some other way (yet to be defined, but certainly likely to emerge as an alternative to big bad government).

I can direct you to books on that topic, if you like. There's a new one coming out that looks at many historical examples of legal systems: ""Legal Systems Very Different From Our Own."" The author has some ideas about workable legal systems for a libertarian society.

> And where does this ""dealt with somehow"" stop? If phosphates are bad for the rivers, and people can't be trusted to voluntarily stop using them on masse,

I can direct you to some works on environmentalism in a libertarian society too.

> It just means swearing off any kind of system that might have the resources or authority to deal with them (or at least believing that such a system should be extremely limited, and yet retain the capacity to deal with things)

Yes, libertarians believe that there's some way of addressing any given social ill that's compatible with libertarianism and which requires only resources and authority that can be legitimately raised, or gathering more resources and authority leads to a worse social ill. This is of course entirely reasonable and consistent. Any system that addresses some problem without regard for the cost probably isn't a good one.

So the criticism you might have here is only that you don't agree with libertarians on the right balance and you're willing to try to solve problems by doing things that libertarians see as worse than the problems. That's fine, that's a typical political disagreement that doesn't make libertarianism any different from any other political approach.

> Defended against by a body that barely, if at all, uses public funds (taxation is violence-enabled theft)

Yes, that's the libertarian position, that this can be done without taxation.

> Ah - so if there was less government, the price of drugs would be lower, and addicts would be able to afford them. The only issue that addicts pose to a society is the crime they present from not being able to afford their drugs. Let them do what they want, and the rest of us can step over their corpses.

That's not a claim I made. You claimed that one problem they present is stealing to feed their habit and I showed how making drugs illegal actually worsens that problem. The fact that your solution to that problem makes that problem worse does not imply that that's the only problem.

> None of them have kids or dependents so what's the big deal? The health of addicts and the problems stemming from lack their of has 0 effect on society and presents us with 0 burdens.

No, this is only your strawman. As already covered, these are problems but ones which libertarians think can be addressed with voluntarily gathered resources and without violating anyone's property rights.

> TIL that the real problem with opiod addicts is affordability. Not losing their jobs/homes/etc because their lack of capacity to function. If they could get more opiods more easily, we'd all be fine.

Again, this is just your strawman. Feel free to present an argument addressing what I actually said. Of course drug users lose ""job/homes/etc."" other ways than just incapacity, and that's not directly because of the drugs but because the drugs are criminalized. So if you're concerned about people losing jobs/homes/etc that's just another dimension on which to oppose drug criminalization.

> TIL that pharmaceutical companies made oxycontin because of....the risk involved in trafficking low potency drugs? Or let me guess - the pharma companies arent to blame, the government is for allowing them to operate. If there was less government, there would be more competition, and more competition would mean less aggressive sales of harmful drugs.

If I were as ridiculous as you're being I would now accuse you of believing that Oxycontin is the only drug, or the only drug that has ever caused addiction or any problems.

> You've lost me with this particular strawman. I never said ""government needs to exist so the addicts can be locked up"".

You implied that the libertarian policy on drugs, which is to roll back all the harmful policies we have, would result in more harm. Explaining the harms caused by those policies is necessary to show that the harms caused by drug usage itself is less than the harms caused by the anti-drug policies.

So really I was interpreting your position as ""government needs to exist so that not only addicts, but people who otherwise can support themselves, contribute, take care of their kids, etc. get locked up."" Now if you really only mean ""libertarian drug policy would be worse than some ideal policy I dreamed up for governments to implement which I haven't specified,"" fine. Still, it doesn't seem like there's any good reason to oppose rolling back all these harmful policies that you apparently also agree shouldn't exist. Even if nothing else was done, that rollback would be hugely beneficial for society, because those policies really are that harmful. Then of course there are libertarian ways of working on the social ills caused by drugs like children of addicts in bad situations, etc.

> WTF? Are you actually going with ""I'm libertarian because I don't believe in shooting and raping innocent people, and that's why I believe we should drastically lower taxes, remove business regulations, and reduce the size of government"" ? Seriously?

The policy under discussion was not lower taxes, business regulations or the size of government in general. It was your implication that having drugs legal is an undesirable policy. Drugs should be legal because the social harms of criminalizing them are far, far greater than all the social ills caused by drugs put together. Once it's clear that the harm of criminalizing drugs makes such a policy entirely untenable, then alternative solutions to solving the social ills caused by drugs can be advanced.

> Regardless, the fatal flaws of libertarianism are this

> 1) The definition of it, and the place of where government is and isn't involved within it, changes wildly from person to person. For you (for instance), libetarianism is primarily a lack of police state. Where you think the government would and would not still have a role in this theoretical libertarian society is probably not the same as someone' elses

Yes, there are variations from libertarian to libertarian. That's not actually any different from any other political ideology. I see plenty of variation between supporters of socialism or democracy or whatever. Some libertarians might even be wrong while other libertarians are right.

> 2) Besides being horribly inconsistent from person to person, it's very faith-based. ""Things will get better if we just removed X!"". Sure, there is a temptation to talk like there's an economic basis for things by using terms like ""elasticity"", but utlimatley it's founded upon faith that less government means a better society. It's fundamentalist in a way. You might as well be saying ""faith in Christ's love and God""

This is just an assertion. In reality many libertarians believe what they believe for many reasons, from having experiences of things working out or working poorly or studying history and extrapolating, from thinking through arguments and coming up with conclusions, or indeed from intuition and values.

> 3) It's founded on the premise that selfishness is harmless and does not affect others or cost society, but then doubles back and is essentially ""except when it does, then we need government to step in and do something""

And this is nonsense. There are some libertarians who hold that 'selfishness is a virtue' but even they are talking about a qualified ""enlightened"" self interest. If this is really what you think is libertarianism's fatal flaw then things are looking pretty good for libertarianism. Here's a debate on [selfishness as a virtue][1] between libertarians (and as usual Gene Epstein has the correct position.)

Gold is hard to store, hard to split, does not appreciate like investments, and won't hold serious value in a major collapse. What value does gold hold besides jewelery and industrial applications? I guess its more durable than cash under the mattress, but that's not worth the draw backs.;3;1;False;Reus958;e9w3rpb;A Picture is Worth a Thousand Words.;9xkzxm;https://i.imgur.com/X7KXRvy.jpg
"Well that’s why you have “limited government” and not “no government.”

The key is figuring how exactly just how small and limited the government should be and still be effective in protecting our inalienable rights, without it becoming big and intrusive enough to infringe on our inalienable rights.";1;1;False;phernoree;e9up1n9;A Picture is Worth a Thousand Words.;9xkzxm;https://i.imgur.com/X7KXRvy.jpg

"He is saying that most people answering the poll aren't really concerned about not getting full value on that 10k, ten years from now.  Because it is easy for (many, but not all) people in first world countries to set aside 10k in ten years.

The risk is losing out on your potential gains.  

I will drop $10 on a bar bet with my friends for fun.  I wouldn't drop $10,000 

$10k ten years from now... Is small enough that I will gamble with it.  Btc has the highest likelihood of being worth a lot in ten years, so yeah, let's do it.  It also had a high risk, it might be worth nothing.  But I'm okay with that risk.

If it were 10 million, I wouldn't take that risk.  Ten million, ten years from now, would mean I retire wealthy in that day.  I don't care about getting the most ROI, I care about not losing it.  So I want a conservative investment.";3;1;False;VisaEchoed;e9vczds;A Picture is Worth a Thousand Words.;9xkzxm;https://i.imgur.com/X7KXRvy.jpg

"Not ""7% unless it corrects"". The 7% is an average figure that includes a possible correction. If you assume that the market doesn't correct, the expected return is much, much higher than 7%.

More like >10% unless it corrects.";2;1;False;Tulip-Stefan;e9x113f;A Picture is Worth a Thousand Words.;9xkzxm;https://i.imgur.com/X7KXRvy.jpg
