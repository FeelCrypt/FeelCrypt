"I don't agree with this. Just because a an energy source is not, net positive in energy doesn't mean you don't use it. Humans get fed dead humans, it's not far fetches to thing you can't easy convert organic matter to energy via a machine. Yet humans are capable of producing some energy at a lower efficiency, and as you're being fed the remains of other humans, you re a net positive at the end. 

Your car is not net positive, you lose a SHITLOAD of energy for what you get when using your car. That doesn't mean you stop using it.

This is a fan theory at best, and a pretty far fetched one full of assumptions. 

Also the premise of ""creating a complicated world"" is kind of moot. It's  a computer program, programmed by other computer programs and AI, wouldn't take that much ""effort"" to create it.

"I can help you, a decade later and these nerds still haven't noticed people don't wrap their head around incorrect terms

currency = misnomer.

coin = misnomer.

mining = misnomer.

""bitcoin"" is an asset in limited supply, which people can trade. All the words chosen are mere skeumorphs to what we consider to be antiquated and less useful forms of trade, only because other people relate to those words. Its like when the iphone's contact list used to look like pages from a notebook or rolodex when its not an address book or rolodex. Bitcoin is called bitcoin because ""elliptic curve cryptographic ledger units"" are much less relatable.

Bitcoin needs computational processing power to function. People that give the most computational processing power are rewarded in bitcoin. The kind of processing power bitcoin needs is very rudimentary, so whoever can do a rudimentary task the fastest gets the most bitcoin. This process is colloquially called ""mining"", as it is an analogy to having the best equipment to find gold, in a mine.

Back to GPUs? Well here's the thing, people stopped making computers that do one thing really good, DECADES ago. Because they are useless. *C*PU's are only things to brag about because they do GENERAL processing, everything, marginally faster and better than last year's CPUs. Making a computer that does everything, quickly, is hard. Making computers that do one thing really well is retarded. With that in mind, GPUs are good at doing some things really well, much better than CPUs.

People use them to process bitcoin stuff faster, than the rational people that use CPUs.

People have also made customized computer chips, single purpose processors, that only can process bitcoin. That is how 'mining' is done today for bitcoin. With these products called ASICs - merely stands for Application Specific Integrated Circuit - there is nothing special about them as everyone knows how to make a single purpose processor for 50 years. Now there's a reason to again.

The fact that humans are portrayed as a ""renewable source of energy"" in The Matrix has always seriously bugged me though.

"Humans *think* the machines are keeping them alive as a power source. That doesn't make any sense scientifically speaking, however. You can't use a human as a power source without providing it with much more chemical energy than it is able to produce in heat. And I'd expect the machines would be smart enough to be able to consume chemical energy and convert it to electrical energy without using humans.

Besides, if the machines wanted the humans just for energy, they wouldn't put so much effort into creating the matrix world. Why create a whole world anyway? They could have just drugged the humans with sedatives, fed them with chemicals, and allowed them to produce heat, living like vegetables, with no experiences. But there's so much effort and development that went into creating a realistic matrix world.

The matrix films tell the story from the side of the humans. The humans think they're good at producing energy. They're not. The matrix is a lie. Humans aren't used by machines for energy. They're used for outsourcing human computation. The machines cannot solve some hard computational problems with AI – they're bad at things like face recognition, computer vision, language, translation and creativity. This is why they have created the whole matrix world: When they need to perform some hard computation that requires human computation, they translate the problem into the matrix world. For example, if they have an image or video as an input and want to see if it's the video of a cat or a dog, they show that video to a human (remember the cat in the matrix?) and notice its reaction, translating it back into digital output for their own use. Hence, we are not the machines' batteries... we are the machines' computers.

The only way to be able to achieve this is to have humans live in a good, realistic environment in which their brains have healthily developed and they have been educated by their peers. If the humans are distressed or suspect that the world isn't real, they will not be able to perform these computations efficiently and correctly. This is the very reason that so much effort went into the development of the realism in the matrix world – with the experiences, the pain, and everything that comes with it.";263;25;False;dionyziz;dk2dzyx;Every GPU's worst nightmare;6mjng5;https://i.redd.it/rkwou70jut8z.jpg

"I don't know, I've seen gamers push their cards to extremes that would make a miner shudder.

Mining is about creating the most efficient and stable environment. This includes undervolting, downclocking, etc. An unstable card results in downtime and time is money. It's far more likely for a farm to favor lower hashrate and better GPU longevity and uptime over max temps, poor efficiency, and crashes.

The most frequent cause of a dead GPUs outside of manufacturing defect are from frequent power/thermal cycling cracking the solder balls in the BGA chip. Gaming has a higher tendency to damage cards than mining with it's steady power and thermals. Then take into account how many gamers overclock for that extra bit of performance, pushing their cards beyond 100% stable and you vastly increase the likely hood of a dead GPU.

I'd rather buy a GPU from an experienced miner, than from a gamer with unknown variables and frequent power/thermal cycling. Sure the card has been heavily used for mining but it's been run in such a way that is to preserve hardware.

Yes, it's still 19x up since the beginning of the year. Hashrate could not rise this quickly, it's only 10x up now.

Now, mind you, most of them ideas had to do with messing with your fan parts. Now, that may seem like a good idea, but the truth is, when you snip a GPU's fan cable, most of them overheat in, oh, about... seven minutes. Most of them.

Well, more than most. Then I says, ""Heck! The GPUs we sell to LeQuint Dickey got it worse than that!"" And they say, ""Let's benchmark him to death!"", or ""Throw him into the recycle bin."" And I said, ""What's so special about that? We do that all the time! Hell's bells, the GPUs we sell to LeQuint Dickey got it worse than that!""

"Memory intense algorithms are more common today, but the current mining situation also offers dual mining. Two algorithms at once which has comparative power consumption to the days of bitcoin/litecoin mining despite lower clocks. Bitcoin and litecoin mining also had a large emphasis with finding a balance between core and memory clocks, not just pushing everything to the max.

Even when bitcoin was mined on GPUs, it was of great importance to keep the temps low. High temps = instability = downtime = loss of funds.

Most of the GPU's during those times ran hotter, and used more power because of their inefficiencies. Those 4850, 5850, 6950 cards all had high TDP by today's standard.

But I do agree, mining then vs now is different and not directly comparable. This image was made for how mining is today so I'm referencing current mining for wear and tear on GPUs vs gaming. 

It still stands that running a card at a constant power level and temp vs frequent power and temp cycles will generally allow the card to last longer.";3;0;False;ObviousWallAntenna;dk2rkin;Every GPU's worst nightmare;6mjng5;https://i.redd.it/rkwou70jut8z.jpg

"I'd say 60 vs 62 could make a difference. It may not have much of an impact on peak fps, but your average and minimum frames may be higher giving an overall better experience. If you're only aiming for 60, you should consider an upgrade to a 120, or 144 refresh rate monitor. The difference between 60 and 120 or 144 is subtle at first, but becomes night and day the more you use it.

If you mined with your fans on 100% while near the tjmax, I'd question your knowledge of sustained, or even hobbyist farm mining. Sounds like you had an enclosed gaming PC and just ran a miner without too much thought in cooling solutions. GPU fans shouldn't go above 80%, with an upper limit of 85%. After that you get diminishing returns for cooling, more noise, and much more stress added to the fans and fan header.

Instead of pushing GPU fans to max, you should have been opting for better airflow and lower ambient temperature.
