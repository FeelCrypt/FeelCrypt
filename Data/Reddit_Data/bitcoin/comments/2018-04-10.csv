"> If deflation is at 2%, why can't there be a safe investment that makes 1%? 

I would think the only reason to put your money into an investment with a nominal X% return would be if deflation were expected to be less than that.

>Deflation has been as high as 10% on the gold standard (when gold was continually being produced, but hoarded faster than it was produced), you can't imagine a safe investment that pays less than 10%?

If that period of time lasted long enough that people came to rely on a 10% deflation then I would imagine that people would not invest their money in something that paid less than 10%.

>  Unless all businesses see instant returns on investment then deflation is degrading the profitability of those investments over time relative to cash. the longer the time between investment and return the worse the effects will be. Cash can only buy more if people selling now get less than they used to, there's no getting around the fact deflation profits holding cash at the expense of people not holding cash.

I don't see why someone investing in a business requires instant and continuous return while sitting on cash does not.  Prices don't fall continuously on all goods simultaneously either.  Prices fall unpredictably as a result of suppliers making production runs in chunked increments and experiencing the cost of inputs they pay and the prices they can sell at changing.  You can have 10% deflation in a year with some prices rising over a period of months and others falling for the average prices to have fallen by 10% by the end of a year.  Price discovery between all of the commodities and services used in a large economy is chaotic in the short term even if, over a year, it averages a 10% decline.

>Deflationary spirals aren't hypothetical, they happened all over the world during the Great Depression, you can crack a history book and find real world examples of everything I've said here.

There were a lot of other things happening during the great depression than deflation.  And the great depression was a world wide phenomenon, so saying that what happened ""all over the world"" during it is not a wide random sample of any particular force at work.  A better sampling, to assess how deflation works, would be of deflationary episodes over time and place.

There were many episodes of deflation before the great depression that did not have any depressive effect (a negative average real output growth rate).

[Here](http://www.nber.org/papers/w10268.pdf) is a study of deflationary episodes in 17 countries over 100 years.  From the abstract
>Are deflation and depression empirically linked? No, concludes a broad historical study of inflation
and  real  output  growth  rates.  Deflation  and  depression  do  seem  to  have  been  linked  during  the1930s. But in the rest of the data for 17 countries and more than 100 years, there is virtually no evidence of such a link

">Every serious trader benchmarks his P/L against the overall price trade, not against zero.

Correct, but every single serious technical trader also uses technicals purely as indicators for arbitrage, rather than as signals regarding market sentiment. 

>And following your benchmark, everybody trading and losing less than 2/3 of his money since December 21 should be considered successful...

Agreed in principle, actually, although I'd argue that to be considered successful, their TA would have had to work in both the bull market before December, and the bear market after. Not only that, but because of the bell curve distribution of trading success/failure, you would actually expect several instances of pure success having all to do with luck, and nothing to do with Technicals.

>AND you need the right instinct.

This is exactly what you DO NOT need. 

if you use instinct, you are infusing emotion into your trades, meaning luck plays an exponentially greater role in your success for every trade you put on.

>that's why you need confluence of several indicators

adding several indicators actually gets you further away from success, especially if your initial indicators don't actually recognize forward patterns on their own. It's a well defined property of Bayesian statistics. I like Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman for a layman's explanation for why that is the case.

"> Yes, RSI/Stoch were overbought for fucking 6 months.

[For the record, the NASDAQ has only reached 87 on 14 month RSI in 1% of it's history, in 1996, 1986, and 1955. All 3 times, after hitting 87, 3 of the greatest Bull markets to ever exist happened.](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/23/stocks-have-not-been-this-overbought-in-22-years-says-technician.html) 

>Every MACD cross down as obviously a false signal.

Nothing is obvious in technical analysis, and back testing MACD proves that it's basically useless. Again, backtesting takes feeling and luck out of the equation, and help paint a better picture. Even if you do find success backtesting, the hardest part is after that: to ensure you aren't curve fitting. 

>Learn price action and you would've been able to make a ton of money trading the bull/bear flags.

Price action isn't some mythical thing that people can get good at by experience. There is no feedback loop for it; it's impossible to know if you are being lucky, or being smart. 

Consolidation periods are one of the only times you can make money using technicals, but that isn't because technicals are doing anything: it's because you are cutting your losses using stops, and letting your gains ride.

Even then, back testing reveals that you under perform the bench mark, because you can not time the tops, or the bottoms, with any system of logic. In other words: if you make money trading flags, it's because you're on the lucky side of the bell curve, not because you're smart. 

I actually use technicals, but only in arbitrage. They are extremely helpful when applied correctly. However, the conditions to apply them correctly don't exist in bitcoin.

I suppose only time will tell how much is luck and how much is using TA to skew probabilities in my favor. No question, that the majority of people who post TA are basically full of crap and it’s no better than  flipping a coin. I can only speak to my experience, which is obviously anecdotal. I will say this, the last few months have given me a lot of practice on identifying when BTC is about to take a heavy fall lol. The last 4 big drops I’ve been able to identify and tether up, then get back in before the next upswing, with moderately tight stoploss orders in case I called the bottom prematurely. Last night for example, there was a pretty clear RSI divergence on multiple time frames, with price moving up while RSI was going down. Sold 1/3 of the portfolio a few hours before the drop then bought back in at a cheaper price this afternoon. I’m not saying it’s going to work every time but so far it’s been a much better strategy for me than just holding 100% of my portfolio. If I were filthy rich I’d just DCA and buy on every dip, but I already used all the money I could afford to lose by the end of Feb. So I had to find another solution. I’d say my strategy is generally 2/3 hodl, and 1/3 trade using TA to increase my total number of coins. So far it’s going fairly well. Maybe I’ll have a different story in a few months. ;2;0;False;wearecrypto;dx3t6kk;Everyone, it’s the world of crypto. All your TA means nothing;8b0v18;https://i.redd.it/26bocgtchxq01.jpg

"Basically ""yes"", if somebody fancies themselves as a chart technician and is losing money on a regular basis, they probably have misguided notions as how to trade. 

Keep in mind there is not one single resource on the internet that will teach anybody how to trade properly. There are many good resources which help teach portions of technical analysis but there is not a single one which will weave it all together into an easy to understand ""formula"" (probably not the right word, but I hope you understand what I mean).

I am 48 years old and started to learn about TA about 25 years ago. Nobody taught me a thing, but that's not to say that I did not derive much of my knowledge from other people's efforts. Probably one of the most valuable pieces of information that I came across in the years of learning (and I am still learning to this day, and still make mistakes to this day) is Elliot Wave Theory. 

Many people think that TA is simply looking for things like double bottoms, or inverted head and shoulder patterns, or flag formations. They think they can simply look for these patterns and then try to time entry points based on where the RSI is in conjunction with the MACD, but its not that simple. Then when their trade goes south they get upset saying that TA is hogwash.

The people who eventually learn how to trade profitably using TA are in no hurry to share the information with anybody because, well, why should they, and why would they? There is no financial incentive large enough to give away a life's worth of effort and learning.

"Gambling in general is sort of the same as insurance, for a given value of ""sort of the same"". Economically, they're a similar tool, but opposite uses of it - insurance levels out risk by essentially betting against yourself, gambling spawns extra risk. Neither is necessarily a horrible position to take, but while certainly both get repackaged into neatly contained packages of pure highway robbery, gambling/high-risk positions are the more obvious go-to. People relate differently to small chances vs small risks, with ""small chance"" being the easier sell. Like ""You own a person $60. He offers to let you get out of it if you roll a 6 on a standard dice, if not you pay $70"" vs ""You're selling an item for $60.

TA isn't meant to be right all the time either btw. On top of that it's not possible to exponentially grow your capital to the point where you be a totalitarian. You can buy and sell 3000$ in a single trade on bittrex without having a big effect on the overall market, but buying 50,000$ and selling in a single trade is not possible. If you could then yes, it's possible that someone would be a totalitarian. And all the successful TA traders don't post their charts online for people to see. You want to base your trades off what other people are going to do, and if you post your prediction online then people will act the same way you will which then renders the prediction useless. That's why Wall Street trading algorithms are so secret. From my experience, the people posting charts and predictions online are the ones trying to create pumps, which is why these charts are often posted through social media where they can influence a large amount of people to prop the price up.

TA is a tool. And like any other tool some people are more or less skilled in its use. There’s a lot of TA bashing in crypto. I can tell you this. I got into the market in Jan, pretty much the worse time and got my ass kicked for 2 months. TA helped me to start making money without shorting and in a bear market. Specifically, using RSI divergence to help identify trend reversals, buying dips and selling peaks. I’m still in the red but I’ve managed to significantly increase my number of coins and turn what would have been losses if I just held into gains.

"This should be the top voted post -- anytime someone includes the phrase 
""TA is useless it can't predict the price of BTC"" means they fundamentally lack the concept of what TA actually is.

It is an **analysis** -- ie it is like discussing symptoms in a patient and drawing some inferences of what could be the cause and methods of action going forword to identify and treat such patient. TA is no different.

Secondly just because you can't apply TA and be profitable doesn't mean it is debunked as useless -- 99.998% of basketball players will never make 1 cent by playing basketball -- probably equally the amount of people that could successfully perform brain surgery but that doesn't mean it is bogus. The problem with trading is people think it is ""easy""-- some guy looking at charts on his computer clicking around how hard can that be -- well truth is to become a consistently profitable trader you need 1000s of hours of practice likely over the course of years -- too many people get lulled into to believing it is easy.

"Yes, something that was driven down our throats in finance school was about the semi-strong market theory.  *“If people know the price will go up tomorrow, then the price will go up today.”* That was a mantra that was constantly repeated. 

That’s the reason we saw crypto price soar already.  People were basically betting that crypto had already succeeded and priced it accordingly. 

Eventually a considerable amount of doubt has been cast and so the price got balanced out considerably.  Even $2k bitcoin is still a pretty strong market cap bet that it will be moderately successful for commerce.  Not full economy scale, but many times larger than what we are seeing now.

"Agreed. 
A simple understanding of support and resistance lines has helped me heaps to pick good entry and exit points. Bitcoin bounces off these all day. Anyone who says they are worthless is simply not looking. I'm not claiming these patterns are due to some innate human physci, but as long as everyone is drawing the same lines it will make big moves when it hits certain trends. Obviously there is still uncertainty, but if you are going to be buying and selling any crypto it is stupid to dismiss TA completely.

TA trading works if you know what to look for and realize that it isn't a price prediction but rather a way to make an educated guess to put the odds in your favor. 

You are right about the idiots on twitter though. People in general will be hesistent to say they wrong calls but more than happy to share their wins. People daytrade because you get in and out quickly and don't suffer huge losses. You invested at the right time, good for you, but investing is not always the right idea.

That's just one example out of many bad calls from multiple people I follow.

TA isn't about being always right, it's about risk management. You make a trade when risk/reward ratio is in your favour. 

My guys recommend to never risk more than 1% of your balance using proper stops. They say that it's not about winning big once, but about making consistent profit over the months/years. They warn against using high leverage. 

They also say repeatedly how retarded it is to hodl through a 80% retrace.

"First off, TA isn't better than a coin flip.

Second, being better than a coin flip is a common fallacy and is a good way to enter financial ruin because you've made the dangerous assumption of believing that financial markets are Gaussian when they are anything but Gaussian.

I run a quant trading firm and so many new comers to this industry make these incredibly naive assumptions about how to model financial markets and the idea that all you need to do is be better than a coin toss is probably the number one mistake people make I kid you not.

Think of TA as being like a coin toss where when you're right, you win 1 dollar, and when you're wrong you lose 100 dollars. I'll even rig the coin in your favor so that it comes up whatever you call for 90% of the time.

Would you like those odds? It is waaaay better than a coin toss after all so it should be good right? But if you think about it for more than 2 seconds you realize why you'll eventually go bust in the long run.

TA is simply worthless, all these low-effort ways people have to make money and cheap Youtube videos or flashy websites talking about this or that strategy are just cons designed to get you to flip the coin and you fall for it because you think that having a coin rigged in your favor is going to make you money when it's going to do anything but.

If you care about this field and actually understanding how financial markets work, ditch the cheap and tacky crap about head and shoulder patterns, or inverted Rhino pattern and all these gimmicks people write about, pick up academic text books on calculus, probability, statistical mechanics, machine learning and put in the years and years of hard work that is actually needed to understand this type of phenomenon.

But of course that's actually hard, it requires real work, patience and dedication, so instead of putting in the effort people delude themselves into thinking that a charting pattern that looks like a shooting star or an upside down hammer is clearly a predictor of tomorrow's price.

"pick a basis. it isn't 0 basis, like the chart. I mean, I was referring to specifically ""target demo"" populations. The people rich enough to afford an automobile took decades to happen. So that's another basis: pokemon go is a FREE product that relies on other products to exist. 0 cost piggybacking on assumed expenses.

Now 4 year olds have a cell phone in their pocket, and a massive number of people on the planet have access to a smartphone. I'd say more than have even full internet access.

Not even in the mid-1990s did every household have a computer. Let alone multiple computers, a computer in their appliances, and a computer in their pocket.


Also, ""the internet"" was around for much longer than this chart is purporting, so the ""start points"" are a bit suspicious. 7 years? No.

For example, if you consider ""any app"" getting 50 million users as the product, that's a lot longer than 19 days. Just like ""any/all website(s).""



the chart is mixing:

1. infrastructural users (wider systems) with subsystem users (relies on a prior invention for adoption)
2. physical product users (assembly line, physical products),  and virtual product users (0 distribution needs, infinite cloning/duplication).

Pokemon Go gets 50million users when people have

Electricity > Cell Phone > Internet  and the popularity was boosted by people with Electricity > Television  or  ""portable gaming""

Bitcoin's core base isn't a bunch of children being entertained, it's a bunch of neckbeards who hide money in the walls and listen to HAM radio doomsday alerts.

Just wait until the idea behind cryptocurrency leaks into childrens entertainment programming to get a crypto product 50m in 19 days
