Ripple will eventually be the currency used by everyone and I mean everyone. Backed by Google and the Far East banks are testing it and loving it and loving it by the time it hits the Uk banks and America. Everyone will use Ripple. I mine as well just start buying it. I don't even think it will be tradeable. It hardly is now. But they have the infrastructure built (the banks) and fiat done with. People outside the Cryptosphere won't even know how this happened. and Google prints its own money. So yeah Ripple will be the NWO and represent the only currency taken everywhere used by everyone. IOTA is the only other option that I see as widely used. IOTS and Ripple. Its just like he mentioned above it will be. Government regulated Currency. Then I can see a whole new exchange for all the Forex people that lost big time. Ripple will start representing nations. So it will be like Tehter is now but USDR, AUDR, GBPR. Not all crypto will die, but it will not be used by the masses. Satoshi Nakamoto will turn in his grave. His vision was to create a self-sustaining economy within an economy. Well, it gave Idea to a Bigger Idea. An economy ruled by rich and supported by the poor. This is what will separate the rich from the poor. No middle class. Gold will not be suppressed by the banks anymore and if you are not a billionaire in 5 years you will be a slave to the government.

"Looked at doubling today.

Bitcoin has fully doubled in value 20 times since it's original price at $0.003 in Mar 2010. That is, when it reached $3145.728 its value was ($0.003 * 2^^20 ). It will fully double once more when the dollar value has reached $6291.456.

It had to double twice [to be worth around 1 cent ($0.012) in May 2010](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_bitcoin). So it doubled twice between Mar 2010 and May 2010, we can say it doubled about once a month during those early days.

2x 0.012 is 0.024, *2 is 0.048, *2 is 0.096. In July 2010, bitcoin's price was $0.08, which is pretty close to 0.096. It doubled three more times in two months, or about 1.5 times a month.

We're going back to [this graph](https://99bitcoins.com/price-chart-history/) now. On Oct 31st, 2010, Bitcoin's price is listed as $0.20, which means it had doubled again. $0.096 *2 is 0.192, very close to $0.20. Took 3 months to double, this time.

On January 16th, 2011, bitcoin's price was $0.39, which is very close to 0.384, the next double. This was about 2.5 months from the last double, and is the 7th time bitcoin doubled all in less than a year after being exchanged. February 1st, 2011 marks the next doubling point. Price was $0.74, the next doubling point mathematically was 0.768. That's 8, took about two weeks.

April 24th, 2011 is the next one with a price of $1.67: very close to the 1.536 doubling goal. That's 9, took almost 3 months. May 2nd, 2011 bitcoin's price reached $3.24, a bit past the doubling point of 3.072 for the 10th time bitcoin doubled, only 8 days after the previous doubling. The next doubling point falls at 6.144, the closest record I can find is on May 18th, 2011 when the price was listed at $7.14. That's the 11th double, 16 days later. 

17 days later, on June 4th, 2011 bitcoin's price jumped to $16.41. The doubling goal was 12.288, so it exceeded it by a long shot; wish I could find somewhat better records for the intervening days since it seems it may have hit the 12th double a significant (percentage-wise) amount of time sooner. 

Oh well. The next double point is 24.576, and this is where things get a little weird. Bitcoin held it's price in the $8-13 range for almost two years, here. It wasn't until February 13, 2013 that the price hit $25.47, for a 13th double. The 14th doubling threshold is 49.152, and bitcoin hit just shy of that ($48.63) on March 18th, 2013 - about a month after the previous double. The threshold for the 15th double is 90.304, and bitcoin hit $91.55 on 30 March, 2013 - 12 days after the previous. So far it would seem March is typically a good month for bitcoin.

The 16th double occurs at 196.608, and it's another long stretch before we get there: October 28th, 2013 the price hit $200.07, just past the goal close to 8 months later. Next threshold is 393.216: the best record I have for the 17th double is November 14th, 2013 at $420.77, taking about half a month to get there. Next double at 786.432, which was reached November 22nd, 2013 - 8 days later - when the price hit $825.75, for 18 total doublings.

Numbers are getting bigger, and that was another major bitcoin peak. Price held for nearly 4 years this time, ranging between $200 and $1000 for the duration until on May 7th, 2017 the price doubled for the 19th time, closing at $1553.20 which is *just* shy of the goal of 1572.864. Given that it's about a 1.5% margin of error, I'm granting it, especially since closing prices aren't necessarily the highest trade price that day.

The 20th double occurs when bitcoin reached 3145.728, which we saw on August 7th, 2017, when exactly 3 months after the previous double bitcoin's price hit $3229.29.

The 21st double *will* occur if and when bitcoin's price reaches or exceeds 6291.456.

Bitcoin is not remotely similar to a bag of gold or any other physical form of value, so that's not a fair comparison. Bitcoin is digital so it can be integrated into POS systems and if the merchant doesn't want to accept the currency directly, they can use payment processors like BitPay to easily and quickly convert it to fiat. In fact, companies like Overstock.com, Steam, Bic Camera (large retail chain in Japan), and even Microsoft are already accepting Bitcoin, so I don't see what the problem is. As far as merchants are concerned, it's just another form of payment. The only issue I can think of is the cost of installing or updating POS terminals in brick-and-morter stores. As for online stores, it's just a matter of adding an extra payment option.;1;0;False;Chiyo;dnnvwoh;If Bitcoin hits $100K, I think I care less about being rich than I do about rubbing it in everyones face that kept calling it a scam.;72rzhc;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/72rzhc/if_bitcoin_hits_100k_i_think_i_care_less_about/
