While I'm not going to deny that hosting her own email server wasn't moronic and put national security at risk, Clinton was never officially indicted on treason charges.  Benghazi was investigated 7 times.  9/11 was investigated once.  There was definitely a witch hunt going on.  With that said, I generally find WaPo to be unreadable as they tend to focus the first few paragraphs on political blame instead of reporting what's happening.;14;1;False;big_trike;dckjmhy;"""R.I.P.

"There are two primary ways that news papers can exhibit bias - in their reporting and in their editorials. Obviously it's fairly easy to identify bias of the editorial staff in the op-ed section, but bias in reporting is a bit more insidious.  
  
Generally papers don't outright print falsehoods, and if they do, they correct them. They do, however, word headlines and content in ways that can have an entirely subconscious effect on the reader. A little understanding of [emotive conjugation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotive_conjugation) can tell you how synonymous words can elicit entirely contrary responses in the reader. Another way papers exhibit bias in their reporting is in how and where in their paper they feature stories. This is generally less revealing, however, because at the end of the day the story that will sell will get prime real estate.  
  
The WaPo is by no means a bad paper, and it is one of the most important insights into US politics. Just know the biases - WaPo leans left in reporting and editorial, NYT leans further left in reporting and editorial, and the WSJ tends to lean left in reporting, but conservative in their editorials.

That law has been used to put several people in jail (as acts of treason) for far less important things like emailing the dates and times of a guys own physical training schedule from his military computer to his personal email address.

But she didn't get charged because of who she was.  

But either way the law she was being investigated for breaking was a law that falls under acts of treason.  That is a real issue.  And media outlets down playing that to voters is a horrible act of bias.


And I don't see how her not understanding how to handle secrets in a secure manner shouldn't be a topic of debate in a presidential election where every single thing she is told is a matter of national security.  

But i think trump is a worthless sack of shit that needed to have his shit brought to light as well.

The problem with biased reporting is even if you don't realize it they loose all credibility by downplaying one.

If they had openly had reporters going after unbiased stories of both I think neither candidate would have even made it into the general election.  And after the scandal of the DNC rigging the primaries Hilary should have been considered a non entity anyway.

* the cryptocurrency is fighting for survival

* Bitcoin did have great potential, but it is damaged beyond repair

* A tiny committee of five core developers that control the Bitcoin codebase has become the Star Chamber that guides the future of Bitcoin

* It’s time to admit that the current Bitcoin needs to be scrapped and to take advantage of the innovations behind the technology that underlies Bitcoin, the blockchain
