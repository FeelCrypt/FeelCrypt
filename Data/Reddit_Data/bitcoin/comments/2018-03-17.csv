">Furthermore, as long as your LN node is down, you are at the slight risk of losing funds if someone you had a channel with decides to close a channel using an old transaction.

Wouldn't that depend on you (or any parties acting as your proxy) being offline for longer than it takes for the closing tx to mature? If you come back online in time then you can claim the entire channel value with a breach remedy tx.

"Same value of transactions based on...right. Speculation and day trading! Bruh, that ain't adoption!  

Any asset whose transaction volume is based mainly in glorified gambling is going to fluctuate up and down and one day burst when enough people have decided they've earned enough in profits and see no reason to continue holding onto Bitcoin due to fiat being seen as more practical. The only thing to stop that from happening is for more and more people and entities to actually use Bitcoin and not convert it into fiat as often as they do today. Hodl'ing only temporarily stabilizes things as the goal for many of us is to eventually take out profits in fiat.   

But I'm still a bit cautiously optimistic. If the UX side of things leads to desktop and mobile apps allowing us to send Bitcoin cheaply via LN and as more businesses quickly come to regard Bitcoin as a true store of value that should only occasionally be converted into fiat instead of all the time, Bitcoin might just go the way of gold. It's a bubble that won't pop. It may tank a bit from new ATHs, but it'll stabilize and be regarded worldwide as a universally accepted currency. That's my hope.";1;0;False;;dvtwfyb;After countless late nights, lines of code, bug fixes, and memes...

"Oh, man, David, you chose to use BigCorp's LN nodes? That was a big mistake, dude. They charge mega big fees. You should have gone with ScrappyStartup instead. Sure, they sometimes have routing failures, so you might be unable to make payments for a few hours a week, but at least you won't give 10% of your BTC to line FatCatCEO's pockets.

There will always be important tradeoffs to make when choosing whom to channel with in LN. Those factors include:

1. Fees
2. Server reliability and uptime
3. Channel liquidity
4. Hub connectivity
5. Trustworthiness

The invisible hand of capitalism will ensure that companies that do well in 2-5 will tend to do poorly on 1, and vice versa. If you don't mind spending a lot of money, then you won't have to spend much time researching whom to channel with.

Even then, you will still need to know something about the underlying tech. You need to know that you shouldn't open a channel with a small amount of money, since you pay BTC fees per channel opened and per top-up. 

David opens a channel with only 0.01 BTC, and spends 0.001 BTC in fees to open that channel. So he thinks he has 0.009 BTC left in his wallet. He makes a bet with his friend and wins, and his friend owes him 0.002 BTC. His friend tries to send this to him via LN, but the payment fails because the channel only has capacity in one direction right now. David can spend money, but he can't receive. Oops.

Instead, David tries to use LN a different way. He's heard so much about how LN enables true micropayments, and he wants to try it out for himself by buying access to a New York Times web article. It costs 0.000001 BTC, which is much less than his 0.009 BTC balance, so he thinks he should be fine. But the payment fails, and David is shocked. After spending half an hour searching StackOverflow, David finds out that the first payment with a new channel cannot be a micropayment, because that puts the channel into a state where the channel-close transaction would have an output below Bitcoin's dust limit. This would make that transaction invalid, and you can't put a channel into a state where it can't be closed. So your first transaction has to be a medium-big one.

Instead, David decides to just buy a computer on Newegg. He finds one that he wants that would cost 0.00826 BTC, which is less than his 0.009 BTC balance, so he thinks he should be fine. But the transaction fails, because it leaves him with too little money to pay the BTC fee for the channel close transaction.

Okay, so David chooses a slightly cheaper computer instead. This one costs 0.0075 BTC, which leaves him with 0.0015 BTC to pay the transaction fee on the channel-close transaction. Two months later, David wants to settle his account and close his channel. However, BTC fees have quadrupled since then, so he now need to pay 0.004 BTC in order to close the channel. Unfortunately, his wallet does not support adding an external fee source to a Lightning channel-close transaction, so he can't close the channel at all.

These are some of the issues that can happen with LN. You can make a wallet that hides the complexity of setting up channels from the user, but you can't hide the failure conditions. If LN can't send or receive a payment for something, the UI will just tell you that the transaction failed, or at best ask you to authorize spending more money on fees to set up new channels. The wallet won't be able to guess what you will want to do with LN, so if you don't make the decisions yourself about how to initialize your channels, the probability is higher that you will either run into one of these failure cases or overpay on fees.";0;0;False;jtoomim;dvud9f5;After countless late nights, lines of code, bug fixes, and memes...

"> Also, if you're connected to a node that has less capacity in their payment channels than the size of the payments you want to send or receive, you won't be able to send or receive those payments.

This is not quite true, as I understand it. This issue will be solved by AMP: Atomic Multipath Payments, which will allow you to send one payment split up over multiple channels. So you don't necessarily need to send it all over just one channel.

"If your node goes down, then you can't receive or send any payments, and no LN payments can be routed through your node. 

Furthermore, as long as your LN node is down, you are at the slight risk of losing funds if someone you had a channel with decides to close a channel using an old transaction.

Yes, it matters which node you're connected to. If the node(s) you're connected to go offline, you can't receive or send payments, and if the node(s) they're connected to go down, you can't receive or send payments. Also, if you're connected to a node that has less capacity in their payment channels than the size of the payments you want to send or receive, you won't be able to send or receive those payments. You will always want to connect to people who are richer and more reliable than you are if you want to send or receive payments. 

This begs the question: why would rich people with dedicated servers want to open a payment channel with you? The answer, of course, is fees. Large hubs will only open channels with end users if they expect to earn more in LN fees from the channel than it costs them to open the channel in Bitcoin fees.

"...Um.... what makes some fast talking people hard to understand is that they tend to add a lot of redundant words? /awkward

Like... no offense, sincerely hoping I can help you out here... If I summarise, your entire message is much shorter: ""He's speaking fast possibly because he's in a presentation and it's in his personality to do so. I had a customer do the same and ask about my talking speed as if he was asking if I was on drugs. It was perplexing because I was trying to give them their money's worth while busy and multitasking and we did end up having a high level conversation. Why is that even strange? I can't just sit around, my job requires that I do like 10 things at a time, and I live in a fast paced city so it's not out of place for me to talk fast. Sorry for talking too fast and giving better service than most places. ""

I've roughly shortened your message by 50% and it's essentially saying the same thing. In my country, people equate efficiency with being concise, not being fast.
