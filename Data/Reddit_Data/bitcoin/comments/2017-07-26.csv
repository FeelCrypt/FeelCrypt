You're delusional. Completely brainwashed.
The stories I'm telling you are real world stories. You live in your fantasy world of centralised miners, conspiracy theories, and fear. It's a classic move of how to control the masses and retain power, fill them with fear. I pity you frankly. You completely fail to address the fact I'm telling you I can scale to visa levels today, and you just role out the same old trope. It's honestly sad. I would laugh if you hadn't wrecked the community.

I bet you cannot accurately answer one simple question. What would happen to bitcoin if the block cap were removed today? Go on, I've got time. You can muster up your most apocalyptic scenarios, spam attacks, centralisation, whatever. I will systematically destroy any argument you make. Bring it (you won't because you're a coward with no argument).

Watch what happens when you lot block 2x. You'll ultimately be left in the dust. And while we begin to scale massively on chain, and more and more miners are coming online to fight over the ever increasing price (as they always have), you'll cry about centralization because you can no longer run a ""full node"" on your shitty hardware. And nobody will care, because Bitcoin will have finally, delivered.";1;0;False;heffer2k;dkqly9m;Miners right now.;6otydy;http://i.gifntext.com/XONq3rINt7.gif
"What you said was wrong. A bitcoin wallet is not like any other wallet. I have my bitcoins stored on a Trezor so I am credible. I could leave my Trezor at a restaurant and no one could get my bitcoins. You sit around on reddit and just leave condescending and pointless comments for hours a day. Your on a bullshit streak right now. 

So taking a page out of your book I will now inform you that you have been blocked. Enjoy it. I'm so glad its there so I can keep sad attention seeking people from stealing my time from me. ";1;0;False;lunaislife;dkq1thr;Miners right now.;6otydy;http://i.gifntext.com/XONq3rINt7.gif
