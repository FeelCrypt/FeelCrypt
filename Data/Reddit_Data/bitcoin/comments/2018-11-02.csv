"> How is that at all relevant to our discussion?

you claim you can get insurance. Banks get better deals and yet they still found themselves in a dire situation. Ask yourself, if it is so easy to protect your money through insurance, why are people still having a hard time getting loans? Up to 90% of all startups fail according to startup Genome. That's why you need to be an accredited investor to put seed capital in them. If someone is going to lose money, at least let it be someone who already has enough money. Not someone thinking that this is how they will pay their mortgage or student loans. 

>The advantage of peer to peer lending is that loan seekers can get better rates than they would from banks. Also, investors can better rates by loaning to other people than to loan to banks. Cutting banks out of the process helps both parties.

but they cannot get big loans. They are a microfinancing business. That industry has been there for millenia. The banking system evolved from that. In order to loan a lot of capital, the company will need to get the structure and the network of a bank. 

What do you consider low rates? I can get a short term credit with 3,3% interest rate. So is peer to peer cheaper than that? If so, why would you put your money there as a lender when you could invest in an index fund and get 7%? Heck you can even gamble with the money on sports, by combining low odds, low risks bets and have an 80% chance of getting 10%. Your alternative is just not practical. For borrowers and for you. People who go there are those who could not get a credit at a bank. So they are high risk businesses.

>Lacking sight does not imply anything about somethings feasibility or desirability.

so are you saying that you are gambling? I said I do not see its advantage. Meaning it does not convince me that it will ever become more than a microfinancing business. And you hit me with the ""anything can happen"" argument? I could win the lottery, you know?

>No. They gave various metrics like credit utilization, etc. It's as much as standard algorithms would have access to.

standard? So as it's like the basics? You do not have a competitive advantage if your process is standard. Standard means that everyone is doing it. And you are still a small fry business. So how to you emerge then? I am guessing a user gets a better credit rating the more he repays the loans, right? Let's just hope you aren't his lender when he has a bad month. 

>On the side I'd like to start a business giving loans to other businesses. It might fail. Why should anyone have the pretense that stopping me is in my interest?

because you will be a nuissance. The gov't is trying to protect not just civilians but businesses as well. Having investors puts huge pressure on companies. That's why the gov't wants people who have a certain experience in the field or who are rich enough to not put uneccesarry pressure on the company. If you want to really invest in startups, win your battles first. Be successful in the market. Or you can also hang around networking events. Talk to people starting their businesses and you will find an opportunity to invest in a business. 

Dell got his first loan from a family member. There's nothing stopping you from investing in new businesses. But if your appeal is towards these flashy tech companies with promises of big financial rewards for small early investment, you have to become an accredited investor. You can find someone who became one and ask them how they did it. Just reading the criteria on the websites sounds like too little ressourcefullness on your part and my impression is that you are not ready for such a world if you are not ressourcefull";1;0;False;lakeseaside;e8xlljt;Ron Paul Calls for Exempting Cryptocurrencies from Capital Gains Tax;9slssr;https://blockmanity.com/news/ron-paul-calls-for-exempting-cryptocurrencies-from-capital-gains-tax/
"Here is just a brief article illustrating what happens ALL the time.  A decision to add or remove people/issues/events from curriculums as a matter business as usual of state run education.  In this case the decision to remove Helen Keller from all curriculum might not seem a big deal but the decision to remove “Japanese Imperialism”.as a “cause” of WWII is a pretty good example of state controlling what people should “think” about historical events and issues.
