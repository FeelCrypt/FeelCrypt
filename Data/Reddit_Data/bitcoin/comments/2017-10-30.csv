bitfinex doesn't allow US customer's to trade apparently. I know there is a list of many markets but I'm looking for the best alternative based on previous experience, any suggestions?;1;1;False;tech_auto;dp2yn1e;Dirty forkers;77ru0d;https://i.redd.it/17i59fypk4tz.png
I sold some of mine on Bittrex, back when they would let me withdraw up to 1337 BTC per day. They later dropped that limit to something in the neighborhood of 0.00 BTC per day.;1;0;False;dooglus;dp32rmh;Dirty forkers;77ru0d;https://i.redd.it/17i59fypk4tz.png
"I was talking about something like open bazaar where miners host their own pages and buyers go there to look at their exchange rates and 'shop around' as it were.

If it's being sold to the highest bidder wouldnt it drive up the price of bitcoin?";1;1;False;DuskCypher;dp3dhbi;Hahaha;799zq0;https://i.redd.it/g2w5a8mnkkuz.jpg
Well if you know miners directly, sure. But odds are miners will sell to the highest bidder, so you will still have to pay more than an exchange would pay them.

would the way to remove or reduce fees here be to have your own wallet and buy directly from miners? and has anyone considered a blockchain based protocol for cutting out the middleman and going straight to the miner instead of an exchange?;1;1;False;DuskCypher;dp33u3h;Hahaha;799zq0;https://i.redd.it/g2w5a8mnkkuz.jpg
Well miners only care about mining. They don't care about being a storefront for crypto.;1;0;False;BulletBilll;dp3dxx6;Hahaha;799zq0;https://i.redd.it/g2w5a8mnkkuz.jpg
