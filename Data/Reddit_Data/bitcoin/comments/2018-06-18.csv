I think I'll be using this. Thanks for putting in the work for us to have a simple and easy way to stay up to date.;1;0;False;cate_1;e0w0pq2;I spent 3 months building one of the best apps to track cryptocurrencies. Exchanges API sync, wallet tracking and many other features. I am not 16 but I invested a lot of time into this, can I get some attention anyway or am I going to get randomly downvoted as always? The app is also free.;7trstp;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bitsnapp.com.bitsnapp

Heh.  Think about what you have written: amplitude is increased by a factor of root2, so *twice* the amplitude is multiplied by a factor of 2 x root2 - NO!  The multiplicative factor is the same.

That's true, Wozniak created genius ideas for fun, and Jobs was a passionate individual who could appreciate the potential of what he was looking at. I would almost say that I wish Wozniak got more attention for what he did, but that's not even what he wanted or cared about. ;1;0;False;elwebbr23;e0ughfp;Bitcoin?

"""I say he had a random guy electrocute dogs""

Except that's not what happened. He was contacted by Harold Brown who was at that point already known for his anti-AC views because of deaths due to AC in NYC. Words matter. If you have to distort history just to make a point then what ground do you stand on? And actually calling Edison a ""non contributing benefactor makes me think you don't have the slightest idea of the contributions of Edison himself. It's ironic you disparage the 20th century way of doing things when it was usually Edison coming up with the ideas and implementing them with his employees, compared to the usual modern CEO who's usually focused purely on executive decisions.";1;1;False;summerfr33ze;e0v60db;Bitcoin?

"You say he ""allowed"" a random guy to elecrocute dogs, I say he had a random guy elecrocute dogs. Let's stop speaking in trumpisms. You know what happened as well as I do.

Edison was a deeply greedy and self-centered person. So it's no surprise he is known for being a pioneer in the modern system of getting a bunch of brilliant people to create money and fame for a few non-contributing benefactors at the top.

Imperfect as it may be, it's still probably a net benefit to our modern society, and thats probably why it's the only thing that has ever impressed me about edisons's contributions. of course, I hope we can move beyond this 1900 style thinking as we move into the third decade of the new milenium.";1;1;False;PersonOfInternets;e0uxnlh;Bitcoin?

"Except you're wrong. The peak-to-*zero* is sqrt(2) higher... then it comes the inverted part of the sinusoid, which means peak-to-*peak* is 2*sqrt(2) higher. Power is the same, insulation, inductance and capacitive effects are quite different.

Yes Im aware of that,  but it doesn't mean that's going to be the information provided in the puzzle.
