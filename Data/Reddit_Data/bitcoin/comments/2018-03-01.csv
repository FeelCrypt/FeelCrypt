">It's like, if you want to buy a candy bar. But you can't. And you are with you friends trying to figure out how to buy a candy bar. And your over there in the corner saying, ""I know I know I know. Let's jump off a bridge. That will get us our candy bar."" And all your friends are trying to explain to you that jumping off a bridge has nothing to do with buying a candy bar. But you just won't fucking stop saying that you all should jump off a bridge for a candy bar.

Wow. Your analogy is so complex, abstract, accurate and sensible that I don't understand it at all.

Just throw aside how you haven't even touched any of my points.

>And you don't understand that what your saying has nothing to do with and adds nothing to the topic. Like when your a kid, and your playing chemist, and you mix shit togther that won't have a reaction but you expect it to. You can't just make up words and think that you now can launder money on bitcoin.

You don't give any counter arguments for my arguments. I'm not going to bother.

>You just want to hear that bitcoin is good for laundering money. The fact is that it's not. It is not good for laundering money.

You know I actually like the idea of cryptocurrencies. A few things irk me like the anonymity and how their prices are largely affected by people who want to get rich quick, but I think cryptocurrencies are a good idea.

And I wouldn't feel any worse if you gave me reasons why it's not good for money laundering. Heck I'd learn. But you haven't. And choosing to see me as a person who wants bitcoin to be a good avenue for money-laundering is just mistaken.

You can say ""the fact is it's not"", but that's all you're saying. I might as well say ""the fact is rainbow unicorns exist"".";0;0;False;EvilDragon16;dv0pb9b;Nobody blames a currency when criminals launder money, but if they used BitCoin suddenly it’s a BitCoin problem;7wlmog;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7wlmog/nobody_blames_a_currency_when_criminals_launder/

I mean I write all kinds of software that manages windows servers, but usually from a systems perspective. Stuff to extend Puppet, Chef, Ansible etc. I avoid getting attached to any particular ecosystem. I wrote C# for a year and a half. Long enough to be pretty damn sure it’s not for me. Windows is a clusterfuck of bloat where everything is overcomplicated just for shits and grins. I strongly prefer the *nix design philosophy of modularity and “do one thing, and do it well”. You can see it everywhere. Simple, stupid example: grep vs Select-String. WTF Windows? WHY? And it just goes deeper and deeper from there. LDAP vs. AD, for example. Anything involving Windows domains, point of fact.;1;0;False;ex_nihilo;duzuljo;"""The barriers to entry for tech are very low compared to any other professional field.

"Many here ramble about it not being easy but the tweet is about barriers, not about it being easy.

If ""having to work"" is a barrier to entry by your standards, you probably got the tweet wrong. Yes, with an IQ of 83 you will not develop a single app ever in your life. Damn barriers to entry. And with an IQ of 120 you will probably not become the CTO of a medium sized company. But with an IQ of 100, a computer and internet, you can in fact very realistically get to the point of developing something like flappy bird and release it to an audience of billions in under a 6 months. Sure, a top notch developer with with all the tools at hands does it in 5 hours inception to release but there is no barriers to success in the field regardless of your sex, color of your skin, country of residence (*), ...

I did try to read the article just now and I don't like its tone that men in tech are generally poorly behaved.  I agree with it that Moe Levin (never heard of him before) holding the after party at a strip club is absurd.
