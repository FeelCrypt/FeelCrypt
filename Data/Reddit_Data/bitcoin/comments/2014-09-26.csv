"I'm sorry, you're simply incorrect. It isn't even a ""Christian"" thing or what stance I (or you or anybody else) take on *interpreting* the text; it's a simple real-life fact - there are [over 24,000 nearly identical copies](http://carm.org/manuscript-evidence) (with inconsequential grammar or spelling errors) with barely 1% variation between them. That's not something I made up, and has zero to do with anybody's beliefs - we're talking about reliability of a collection of texts and whether or not they've changed from their original form.

You touched on some other common misconceptions as well, which I'll speak to here:

* The Bible was copied by people who were completely illiterate (untrue; the only people who *could* read and write in those days were well educated)

* The Bible has been re-translated over and over; incorrect, each new translation uses original sources; they're never a ""Re-translation"" of a previous work

* The Bible was modified after the fact. Again untrue; Biblical texts were literally copied *letter by letter* (sounds excruciating) by the Masoretes who, when they took over copying of the text, introduced the numbering system we still use today, for the purpose of ensuring they were creating exact copies (e.g. you could check your ""verse 7"" against the original ""verse 7"" and see they lined up correctly). The copies are very accurate representations of the originals. For example, between the 5,686 Greek copies (NT was written in Greek) and the roughly 21,000 copies in other languages, there is less than 1% variation in the text. That is insane! 

What we now call the ""Bible"" is in reality a collection of first-person account letters, poetry, historical genealogy recordings, etc, covering a wide range of literary genres and writing styles, and maintained with a high level of accuracy and faithfulness to the original writing. There's a lot of reading about it, some [here](http://www.str.org/articles/is-the-new-testament-text-reliable), [here](http://irr.org/todays-bible-real-bible), [here](http://carm.org/is-the-bible-reliable) and [here](https://bible.org/seriespage/iii-how-we-got-bible) if you're interested.";-1;3;False;vocatus;cktcd7k;The Secret Goldman Sachs Tapes - The reporter, Jake Bernstein, has obtained 47½ hours of tape recordings, made secretly by a Federal Reserve employee, of conversations within the Fed, and between the Fed and Goldman Sachs.

This isn't really surprising though; we often see variations in first-person accounts of events even today.

"I don't want to single you out, but I'm amazed you've never heard of This American Life.

It's an NPR radio program that has been going since the '90s. The premise of the program is investigative journalism of individual Americans. They do intense stories about individuals from the famous to the common, covering topics from PTSD to amazing coincidences. Sometimes, their shows are groundbreaking interviews, such as the inside look at Apple's manufacturing in China that landed on news everywhere and hurt stock prices (and the even more dramatic retraction of it when it turned out the subject was a liar); sometimes they're of whisleblowers and sometimes they're detailed recountings of kidnappings or lotto winners, or an inside look at local government.

For instance, one amazing episode was about a janitor that terrorized an entire school faculty and become a strange kind of kingpin, running a weird mobster like crew that intimidated teachers and students alike. Another good one was about a gang of soccer moms that took up PI work, but then the story turned out to be not what it seemed.

It's received numerous awards over its almost 20-year life: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_American_Life#Awards

If it wasn't for the systemic corruption revealed in reports like this one, Bitcoin would likely **not** have come to fruition because the motivation to solve problems that banks and governments *refuse* to address would not have been nearly as strong as it is.

>To everyone concerned about our ""reputation"" I think that is a silly idea that you have an anonymous reputation because you visited a website and created a username. Please don't concern troll about a reputation that doesn't exist. We aren't a homogeneous collective of people... we are all individuals.

"it's actually really interesting and you should take the time to listen if you have the chance but I'll do my best to summarize:

 After the financial meltdown, the Federal Reserve conducted a study on itself because they were shocked at how they could have missed the signs leading up to it. One of the recommendations of the report was to hire people like Carmen Segarra, outspoken, intelligent and independent minded. Basically people who aren't afraid to back down to the banks. She recorded many meetings and conversations and uncovered systemic cultural problems in the federal reserve and Goldman Sachs. After listening to the tapes, the fundamental problem that exists is that the FED has no backbone when standing up to the banks. When Carmen tried to enforce her regulatory duties and basically do the job they hired her for, they fired her. This paragraph isn't a substitute for listening but I hope it helps.

This quote applies to all current monetary systems and is hopefully something that Bitcoin will change.

Although Goldman Sachs is portrayed as a villain and the Fed as toothless, the underlying problems are more about the game than anything else. What the system needs are rule changes; a complete re-engineering. Better, smarter, and tougher regulations and more outspoken Fed regulators, is just tinkering around the edges and won't change anything.

You should check out the book Zealot.  The author does a great job describing the civil unrest with the Roman occupation at the time.  Pilate may have very well wanted Jesus to be dead because one of his main duties was to squash a Jewish uprising.  The Jewish uprising inevitably came later.  It was similar to Britain hating Ghandi.  The Jewish people needed radical transformation, but it seemed that the wealthy temple leaders had no interest in changes because they were sitting quite cozy.  Pilate probably wanted Jesus dead just as bad as the Pharisees.  If the story is true as said in the bible, then he may have been acting sly to make the Jewish people feel that they owned the decision.

"I am totally for dismantling the Fed and the phony fiat money system and the debt driven enslavement system but this story gives way too much credibility to the Fed of it being a government agency. The Fed is NOT a government body and is, instead, a private corporation. ANY regulatory function it performs is strictly and totally as a trade organisation policing itself. With that said, why would any trade group with such a long history of fraud and corruption as the banking industry be expected to have in place a moral and ethical self-policing arm? The corruption happens because the police are corrupt and the corrupt keep the police they want in power.

The danger of presenting the Fed as a corrupt government agency is the very real possibility they will just start a public relations campaign to ""clean up"" their ""government"" agency and will be given another long term lease to continue to function as a private, self policing body.";-3;1;False;Bungeebones;ckt7r2g;The Secret Goldman Sachs Tapes - The reporter, Jake Bernstein, has obtained 47½ hours of tape recordings, made secretly by a Federal Reserve employee, of conversations within the Fed, and between the Fed and Goldman Sachs.

"A massive Reddit comment thread probably isn't the best place to go into this, but you're right - there's a lot of debate over how to interpret some verses in the Bible. But, at least in what you linked, there are quite a few out-of-context quotations which, when used in-context, prevent them from ""saying"" what they say there.

One example is Jesus talking to the rich man - he is testing him by saying, essentially, ""OK, if you're so good, do this one last thing: go give up *everything you have* and follow me."" He knows the man's heart and knows that, at least for this man, wealth is something he worships above all else. Jesus uses the question to expose his heart and real motives.

A second one is the one cited from Luke 19:8-9: in that instance what Zacchaeus was doing (giving away his goods and wealth) was a *response* to what had already happened in his heart (faith in Christ to save him); **not** as a means/""path"" to salvation. Jesus responds by noting that salvation has come to his home; that is, he see's the change in him that is a *result* of his new found belief.
