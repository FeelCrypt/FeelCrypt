Eh sort of. Capitalism - as an economic ideology - was defined by Socialists and Communists in the 1800s. The term simply wasn't used prior to that point.

"Indeed . . . history began as a struggle between tribes, but it evolved into class struggle.  This isn't ideology; it is observation.  Truth be told, I'm open to legitimate pacification, such as when boldly progressive reforms actually prevent ""trickle down"" from becoming uphill flow that concentrates wealth and shuts out working people from participation in economic gains.  However, to see such a huge portion of working Americans siding in favor of being shut out even more profoundly from the rewards of their own labor -- I've spent the past 20 years going from suspicious that was happening to horrified the numbers are so much worse than any of those youthful projections.

The shitty thing is that America really did rebel to throw off the chains of do-nothing aristocrats only to build up a more severely parasitic culture of do-nothing tycoons.  Mark Cuban thinks he understands economics.  Donald Trump wants to be President of the United States.  Dick Cheney actually was Vice President and no doubt did more than offer rare bits of humble advice to his running mate . . . and let's not forget more than shades of hereditary title on that buffoon.  If stupid people want to watch *The Big Bang Theory* and think they've enjoyed a window into the lives of geniuses, so be it.  If stupid people want to endorse hare-brained nonsense about science or economics, then vote likeminded leaders into office -- then it's no longer harmless fun but instead a catastrophically harmful social phenomenon.

"Marx also calls for all officials to be electable and re-callable. The fed is an appointed body separate from the democratic apparatus of the state:

>>Having once got rid of the standing army and the police, the instruments of physical force of the old government, the Commune proceeded at once to break the instrument of spiritual suppression, the power of the priests.... The judicial functionaries lost that sham independence... they were thenceforward to be elective, responsible, and revocable.
>>
>>Karl Marx - *The Civil War in France*
>
> The Commune, therefore, appears to have replaced the smashed state machine “only” by fuller democracy: abolition of the standing army; all officials to be elected and subject to recall. But as a matter of fact this “only” signifies a gigantic replacement of certain institutions by other institutions of a fundamentally different type. This is exactly a case of ""quantity being transformed into quality"": democracy, introduced as fully and consistently as is at all conceivable, is transformed from bourgeois into proletarian democracy; from the state (= a special force for the suppression of a particular class) into something which is no longer the state proper.

This is why throughout history central banks were fought to be kept out of our country, and they did not exist until 1913.  Since then the dollar has lost over 97% of its value.  Also a graduated income tax, public education, as well as many other aspects of the communist manifesto are found in our current system today.

"> What we have today is far closer to socialism than freedom

You have no bloody clue what these terms mean.

Capitalism for itself has nothing to do with free markets. Capitalism means that people can privately own capital. Capital is property that is used to extract a profit - a house that I own to live in it is not capital. A house that I own to rent to another person is capital. A business with its equipment is capital - I can own a business and use it to make profit. I hire workers who create value in the business, and I only give them a fraction of the value they create, and so I make profit. That not every business is equally successful, and that many even fail and disband, does not change this fundamental principle.

What you want is the perfectly free unregulated market that for example Adam Smith described. But he did not describe it as the definition of capitalism, he described it as the way capitalism works the best for the benefit of all. And he did so under *terribly naive* assumptions. Smith assumed things like that a capitalist would preferr having his countrymen working for him, even if he had to pay them higher wages. 

Capitalism meanwhile exists indepdendly of free markets. The third Reich was a great time for capitalists! The owners of heavy industries had the time of their lifes. The corporations that profited for example in the defense industry back then are still going strong: Porsche, Henschel, Rheinmetall, Maybach/MTU...


Equally, socialism does not mean to regulate the markets in favour of the  social good - that is *social democracy*. You have three fundamental directions here:

1. Libertarianism: The belief that capital should be private property, and be without any responsibility. Because Libertarians believe that the power of the market will compell them to use their property for the good of all.

2. Social Democracy: The belief that people should have capital as private property, but that this comes with duties towards the social good - let's say I own half of the American farmland, or that I am the richest man in the country, or that I own half of the nations houses: Then social democrats will say that I have a *social responsibility*. This is set in effect through democratic governmental regulations, taxation, redistribution,...

3. Socialism: The belief that the private ownership of capital itself is unacceptable. That things like means of production, and farm land, and ressources, should no longer be privately owned, but freely available to the public and managed democratically.


>  Democracy gives ""leaders"" the power to decide what you can do, and they sell that power to the highest bidder. It's regulatory capture. As long as people have a government to bribe in exchange for preferential treatment you'll be footing the bill.

So you have two options:

1. Disband the government and hope that the free market will somehow work out for the best and not through us back into conditions like during the industrialisation, where workers were fodder for the machinery. You disband all means of democratic power with the state - corporations are not democratic, they are authortarian structures in which the workers have no right but to accept or to leave.

Libertarians just stop at the level of state regulation, but fail to adress public issues like ""How do we stop corporations from destroying net neutrality?"", or ""What do we do to stop corporate influence on the government?"".

It mentions that lack of action by the fed is accused as being the cause, but the action that was lacking was repairing bad policies set in place by the government when the fed was created in the first place.

"What the extremists here don't get is that most people like (most of) what comes from fractional reserve banking, like the ability to have a lot of capital available for loans. In a metal or bitcoin based economy you'd still have lending but nowhere near as much and it would be much more expensive because nobody wants to lock in their money for the length of a loan unless they're getting a lot for it.  
.  
Consider a 15 year mortgage, even with 1960's style traditional banking (that is to say, no fancy stuff), if deposits are paying for the bank to give a mortgage loan then none of the account holders (financial backers) are out that money for 15 years until the loan is entirely repaid. As it is an indirect loan they are also not getting paid directly from the mortgage that was written by their money, only indirectly as part of the interest the bank pays. Neither the interest nor that loan is possible without fractional reserve. The only way to do a loan would be for someone to back it all at once and have the bank (if it wasn't directly backing the loan itself) act as an intermediary paying the interest plus principle, minus a little cut for itself presumably for its part, to the backer as the payments came in.";-1;0;False;L_Cranston_Shadow;cmvd1y5;My Russian friend sent me this joke;2pb2ku;https://i.imgur.com/k3odZjv.jpg

"I challenge my views all the time, that's why I post so much on Reddit. Although just like the guy from the video concluded in his view on comments, it indeed can be very tedious and means reading through a lot of redudant or flat bad points. Still I think  that on Reddit there can be some good points every now and then.

This guy does discuss open questions of socialism very well, but note that they are no systemic contradictions. They are open questions that are being worked on and need to be shaped out. [Those are the same debates that are being led inside the socialist community](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYQb0fthNfI). We don't want a Leninist or Stalinist system either - those were results of their times and circumstances which removed all the correctives that a system is supposed to have. As the guy from your video rightfully says, nobody has all the answers, so an organic democratic process is necessary, and those were one of the major flaws that the Bolshevik/Soviet fell over as all correctives were removed.

The part you were mentioning about voting is pretty simple - you have the level of the working place, the local level, and the national level. It is very much like today. Only that by democraticising the working place and getting rid of the organic centralisation of capital tha thappens under capitalism, you already provided a great boon to the functionality of democracy. That is the reason the state doesn't work to our benefit today? Why does it indoctrinate us into bad policies like the denial of health services and the war on drugs and the criminalisation of ""online piracy"" and foreign was like Vietnam and Iraq? In very much every issue, you come back to financial interests of the wealthy. 

[The other part of the question is: What can you learn from the opposition?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GD69Cc20rw) Marx founded Das Kapital on the basis of deconstructing the bourgeois economy of his time. He learned a great deal from them. He concluded that capitalism was a necessary precursor to a socialist or even communist society, because there were things we had to gain and that we had to learn from capitalism.";1;1;False;Roflkopt3r;cmvl8r7;My Russian friend sent me this joke;2pb2ku;https://i.imgur.com/k3odZjv.jpg
"If capitalism does not work fine, what makes you hold onto it?

Do you realise that even classical political economists like Smith held protectionism in high regards, because otherwise you end in neo-colonial arrangements like across Africa, where the land and ressources are all controlled by foreigners and small local elites, and nothing is left to the people living there?

The situation you describe is that the state exists to protect the rich from the poor. But with ""more economic freedom"", you do not actually change that: In reverse, you remove the safeguards that the poor gave themselves against the rich. For example social security and basic worker rights.

What social democrats want is a state that protects the poor against the rich. But as you rightfully pointed out, there is the issue of regulatory capture. The capitalists capture the systems which were supposed to regulate the capitalists, and use them to rob the people. You are right on that part.

And that is why Socialism is there: to go beyond capitalism. I think you mistake socialism for the USSR regimes. But those were just early socialist failures just like the first projects of capitalism failed in a feudalist world. The goal of socialism is not to create a system as un-free as the USSR, but to *increase* freedom, by giving everyone access to the means of productions, i.e. to the possibility to build their life for themselves, without being dependend on the capitalist class. Even the dramatically flawed USSR was a drastic improvement of wealth and freedom over the Zarist Russia it took over. The original Marxist theory however is that *capitalism is a necesary first step* to achieve socialism, because socialism requires the free people for its basis. You can see why that is much essier in the modern western hemisphere than in zarist Russia!

As a first step, magine a USA in which businesses are no longer owned by the wealthy, but are managed by the workers themselves. That would be Anarcho-Syndicalism. Would the workers overpay themselves? Look at our economy. Workers are far more afraid of losing their job than of their actual wage.

">Beginning in the Eisenhower era, succeeding Washington administrations have bet the farm on ever-freer trade. Supposedly this would strengthen American economic leadership. To say the least, the powers that be in Tokyo, Seoul, and Taipei, as well as in Bonn, Frankfurt, and West Berlin, discreetly laughed at such epochal naïveté.

>No nation has understood the stupidity of America’s trade policy more clearly than post-Mao China. On the one hand, American leaders have thrown the U.S. market wide open to Chinese exports. On the other, they have ignored Beijing’s in-your-face blocking of virtually all advanced American exports to China. The United  States has been by far the most serious victim of Chinese protectionism.

">We disagree on a lot!

You apparently think that empowering a non-elected individual with control over everyone's wealth is a good thing, such as the Federal Reserve Chair.

Non elected =/= non accountable. Thank god they're not elected imagine how fucked we'd be if we had ted cruz running for head of the fed. 

>You apparently think that live, uncontrolled experimentation on the economy through central bank tweaking is a good thing, when done without traditional scientific methods, which is how it's done now.

It's not live uncontrolled experimentation. It's all calculated long term solutions. The biggest fear with QE was after the initial rounds the fed was extremely afraid of inflation. Which is why QE3 was so delayed. The inflation never came which delayed extra rounds of QE which left the economy in a worse state than it should've been. That's a direct modern day example of how the fed stays cautious and how sometimes it hurts. 

>You apparently think that the dollar is backed by something.

The dollar is backed by something, it's backed by the US economy instead of a meta with no intrinsic value. Same thing with all modern day countries. The biggest problems with having gold or any other commodity is that, 

* One, people are still going to look to the US economy to judge the strength of the dollar; anything else that it's backed by just complicates the issue. 

* Two, you're limiting all human production possibility to the amount that we can mine. Which leads to massive deflation. '

*Three, massive deflation is cataclysmic in a world economy, because it ruins benefits of exporting. Look at Japan, every-time a strong Yen is reported which seems like almost any quarter their economy takes a huge dive. It's the same reason that China artificially holds down the price of the yuan. '

The United States in terms of value is still the second or first biggest exporter in the world. Any deflation leads to a huge loss in jobs in the US. Which happens anytime you can't get enough of a the commodity ""you back your currency"" with. The US dollar is basically as capitalistically priced as possible with the few exceptions of inflation. 

>I can't. There's no way to exchange my dollar for some fixed portion of ""the US economy"" (as you claim it's backed by).

You can exchange your dollar for goods and services literally everything around you is backing your dollar right now. Your backing is jobs reports and GDP growth and exports. Not a metal that

These are the origins of my capital accumulation, and we see NONE of the theft which you claim MUST occur. Therefore, your statement MUST be false.";1;1;False;;cmvxq1w;My Russian friend sent me this joke;2pb2ku;https://i.imgur.com/k3odZjv.jpg
"The origin of capital accumulation begins where all creation of wealth begins: In land and ressources. What can you create if you have neither of these things?

The Americas provides a great example of it, because there the accumulation is historically recent and well documented. The settlers come and annex the land. What was previously *free* land, often used by the natives (in more or less communal ways) now becomes property that nobody else may use anymore. It has been stolen. Where in this world can I still freely work land or work ressources without infringing on somebody's private property? Nowhere. The frontier is closed. The world is capital now, and it was stolen from free people.

Your labour is not capital. Bill Gates can retreat from all economic activity and let his capital work for him, and he will have a great living. Can you retreat from economic life and let your labour work in your stead? No. Labour is not capital. Nor is it labour itself that you sell, you sell your capacity to do labour. And you sell that capacity to a capitalist, because you need access to ressources and means of production, which the capitalist has stolen from free access. Your labour and its results is not your own anymore, it is taken from you, and you are merely compensated for that by what is your wage. And necessarily your wage is lower than the amount of value that you create, or otherwise it would not be profitable to employ you.

Of course this model does not account for independends who own their own little bit of land or means of production and still can produce for themselves, but that is because the number of such people is simply irrelevantly low under capitalism. The great urbanisation periods made sure of that, when the big landlords pushed the small farmers out of business and took over their land. A natural development of capitalism - the bigger you are the more efficient you can be There is not much space for small businessses. The mom and pop shop is no threat to Walmart. Where capitalism is unleashed, the small businesses die and big business takes over.

The fact that the conditions of labour are determined by the employer, and that the worker has to produce more value than he may keep for himself, is what means that capitalism *exploits labour*. In that it is fundamentally similar to Feudalism and Slavery: In Feudalism the Serf had to produce more than he may kept, and the rest went to the Nobility. In Slavery the Slave has to producre more than he may keep and give the rest to his master. In capitalism the worker may choose who exploits him, but the result is all the same.

For the majority of the good-producing workers, little has changed. If you look to Latin America and Asia and Africa, the labour conditions are highly reminiscent of those in Europe during the industrialisation. What saved the European and American workers then from such a fate? Class struggle. Organisation and political power. The profits made on their back were colossal, and yet they received nothing of that until they organised and pushed back. The capitalist only ever pays as much as he needs to, that is the behaviour that the market makes him do. So how did they react when the workers achieved higher wages? They opened forein markets and now produce in China, Bangladesh, Pakistan..., [while the former western industrial centers crumble and fall apart and leave behind poverty and despair](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/19/books/review/days-of-destruction-days-of-revolt.html). What is the western middle class really? What is left of them if they don't produce value anymore? They have mostly become organisers of the exploitation. But the material wealth, that is the actual wealth of a nation, is produced elsewhere. [You will see where that leads soon enough](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mature-economy.asp). The causes of the 2008 crisis weren't just some failed government policies, it is [the result of the entire history of US economy](http://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2012/5/7/428250-13363801587809994-Michael-Clark.png), of the issues caused [when big capital breaks the power of labour](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/US_productivity_and_real_wages.jpg).

If capitalism would work out the way it should, we would work less than 20 hour weeks and enjoy so much free time and a magnificent living standard. That's what the rising productivity of the goods producing sector enables us to. That's why Marx considered capitalism a necessary stage before communism, as we need the liberty and material wealth it provides. And then comes the time where the people *cash in the fruits of these developments*, and the only way to do that is by overcoming capitalism in a socialist revolution.";1;1;False;Roflkopt3r;cmvyqdd;My Russian friend sent me this joke;2pb2ku;https://i.imgur.com/k3odZjv.jpg

"Well I'm not a fortune teller so I don't pretend to know how it will exactly play out. However, I am a political scientist so I can tell you exactly what a state is and how it might be broken down. 

A state is a political-legal abstraction which represents the organizations and institutions which collectively control the monopoly on the legitimate use of violence within a given territory, ie have sovereignty over a given area.  In order to destroy the state, there needs to be localized community governments which maintain the right to use violence in their own communities for self-defense. Violence is really the key tool that the state uses to protect property rights. How else can you keep squatters out of an empty house except with violence? A fence is one answer, but that's not gonna work everywhere lol. 

So yeah, you need workers to rise up and take over their factories, for communities to rise up and take over the public institutions, and to exercise their right to defend their communities from outside coercive hierarchies.

Realistically, states need to be incredibly fragile for this to happen, and so it has only happened historically during times of war. If you look at what happened during the spanish civil war, the vacuum of power allowed anarchists to rise up and take power back. But a vacuum of power is not enough, it must be filled by a democratic body, not just the next dictator.

If you look at what is going on in Syria right now we actually see something very similar. In the kurdish region, the kurds have been operating with autonomy in the syrian rojava, and have set up communal municipal ism. Basically, the power rests in the hands of all the members of the community. Power is not so much centralized, but more spread out. This is democracy. What we know as ""democracy"" is really polisarchy, or the rule of the vote. To reach real democracy, you have to recognize how other factors besides voting (namely economic factors) influence politics. For example, in America, we don't have real democracy, or pure democracy you could call it, because the people don't really rule. The people share power with wealth, so it is a capitalist polisarchy. 

Honestly I would just like you to think about it like this. Who benefits when the workers believe that communism is impossible because of human nature?

More like there has always been a warlord with an army that has monopoly on services (security, schools, roads...)

>The system that has been so successful to date has been a tightly regulated variation of Capitalism. It is NOT an unrestrained market.

Usually what happens is a state is created with a very small government (usually just an army, police and a couple of laws). Then the free market starts doing its magic and people become wealthier because they can exchange stuff, work, ideas through negotiation not violence (regulation).

After people become wealthy government gets greedy and tries to get the muney. Then they get control of schools and media (for propaganda) and start creating laws for the ""good of the many"". Of course government (monopoly on power) is unsustainable so it always collapses and the same thing happens again.

>So why is an unrestrained market a bad thing? Because without constant effort from governments it collapses into monopolies very quickly and stagnates and without regulation to stop companies they have very little incentive to actually care about the well being of their customers.

Government is the definition of monopolies. It's is impossible for a company to get monopoly on a service, product in a free society or if it's possible (like if they own all oil sources on the planet) it's extremely difficult and expensive. Negotiation and trade is by far cheaper and easier.

">My point was that you claimed that banks don't pay a direct role in inflation, but then you named the Federal Reserve BANK as an organization that does.

I meant in the private sector, the fed is a bank but not in the traditional sense, i thought it was obvious. 

>As an aside, I think one libertarian view of central banking is that the role that you say is ""extremely important in creating stability"" actually can do more harm than good. By smoothing out bumps (i.e. creating stability and controlling inflation), they cover up the natural fluctuations in the market that are correction mechanisms. By preventing small corrections, they create situations where larger corrections are required.

The example of ""Too Big To Fail"" bail-outs was a good case study. Politicians decided winners and losers in that process. And although someone at Lehman Brothers will tell you that it was personally painful for them, overall letting them fail was probably a good thing. It makes one question why the line was drawn there.... why not let more fail?

Wait what? Economies only have good growth in times of stability. You realize how important a central bank controlling the money supply is? An extremely simplified example of this is back in the 70's and 80's when the United States was suffering from stagflation (stagflation is inflation during a recession). The way economies work means you can only target one at a time. Greenspan who was the head of the Federal Reserve at the time decided to focus on inflation, so he jacked up interest rates and pushed the economy further into recession. This finally slowed down inflation (something a the private sector couldn't have done) and allowed the economy to recover slowly and build back up. Another very very simple example would be the minimum reserve requirements. That is probably the most important thing that the fed does. If the reserve requirement doesn't exist then any bank can lend a dollar out an infinite amount of times, and being a capitalist society it means that competition would push the banks to do so. This would mean you'd have inflation approach infinity. With the fed existing you leave this in the hand of economists not in a competing private sector or in the hands government. 

>This was possible in the Gold era, but there was no accountability. Initially, federal reserve notes represented claims on the federal reserve of gold. Then central banks, through the process of ""creating stability and controlling inflation"" discovered that there is no short-term penalty in printing more claim checks than there is gold. It looked good in the short term, but created a bigger problem that culminated in the Nixon Shock to essentially ""file bankruptcy"" and declare every claim check as invalid. If you print too many claim checks in your attempt to ""create stability and control inflation"", you create the potential for a much larger problem. In the case of the Nixon Shock, it became obvious that there was the real potential of a ""run on the bank"" that would have wreaked havoc on the confidence of the dollar.

Currency isn't backed by a random metal alloyed anymore. Minimum reserve requirements also exist for this reason. This point is completely irrelevant, as in printing money leading to inflation this issue is always front and center. There's a reason it took the fed awhile to begin quantitative easing. It's also another fear that was head during the stimulus and why it was scaled back compared to what it should have been, this even though inflation was never a problem during this whole recovery. 

>Now we're just using these green chits and digital dollars as a ""wealth scorecard"" (or debt scorecard) much like Bitcoin does. And the central bank continues to create more and more, diluting all of the dollars that are out there, and essentially creating an invisible tax on current and future generations. 

This point is irrelevant because the US dollar is backed by the US economy, the amount of money the fed and treasury have input in to the economy, through tarp and QE, and LSAPS's they saved the economy trillions of dollars in future growth. So your point is completely blown out of proportion. 

>And that, too, will ultimately require shock therapy to fix.

"I would like to think most people realize Russia is fucked up. But it's harder to laugh about it because it's more serious.

We can laugh at the US more because, yeah, things are fucked up here, but for the most part, most people are reasonably comfortable. People have the ability to eat more food than is healthy for them? Not the most terrible thing that's ever happened in the world by a longshot.

But we'd feel like dicks if we were trying to make jokes constantly about how stupid Russians are for supporting their government when dissent is crushed so thoroughly and the media outlets vary from pro-government to crazy pro-government.

At least that's my two cents from zero internal knowledge of Russia and my feeling.

Reddit as a whole has a US bias from so many users being from the US or having a connection to the country or familiarity with it. So a lot of us are basically laughing at the flaws of our own situation, and others are laughing at the stupidity of a system which can and should be able to do better.

But it would be like laughing about a genocide to make fun of you guys just because things are bad over there.

Not if they went through the Propoga.... I mean school system.

They were taught, ""haha look at Russia, communism doesn't work. (just totally ignore what happened when we tried to shock them, and many Nations into capitalism, we've nearly got that experiment working, look at Iraq! Almost worked! Well, worked much better than Russia or Chile!)""

""Capitalism, specifically this extremist version of ""free market"" capitalism works perfectly and is the only possible way for anyone, ever, anywhere to live. It's also somehow synonymous with democracy. Democracy is about giving you the freedom to buy what you want, not the freedom to live a fulfilling life, silly.

Success is measured by bank balance, life isn't fair, being rich will make you happy and is the only way to acheive that, and if you're struggling you're just not working hard enough. Also, if you think it's unfair that some people are born rich and others struggle their whole lives, then you're a filthy communist who doesn't want hard working people to keep their hard earned (or inherited) money.""

Add in some, ""Socialism is communism"" and a sprinkle of ""Friedman's economics is only economics"" with a drop of ""Keynesian economics doesn't work"" and bam, you've got yourself a seriously fucked up system that will fuck it's self until it's got no fucks left, borrow some fucks from it's slave masters to fuck it's self some more. All while defending it's right to fuck it's self and celebrating whoever fucks themselves the hardest.

Ideally we would find a nice, moderate middle ground between Friedman and Keynes, and Laissez-faire and socialism. Pick the best parts of each and create something new.

But instead we have extremists on one side wanting the  most extreme version of their preference and pointing out how the most extreme, or not technically ""by the book"" version of the other side didn't work (specially after some serious sabotage in the case of Socialist democracies and military coups)

The problem we have in the 21st century, is that the people benefitting most from the economic system, are the people who decide how to manage that economic system.

It created the most wealthy prosperous nation on Earth.  The USSR fell.  Communist nations always turn to tyranny much faster than capitalist places.  

Sure capitalism turns to tyranny as well over time.  But look at the progression.  Capitalism in America has turned very Communist and socialist prior to turning into tyranny. The tyranny followed from those communist policies because it gave government huge power which was harnessed by monopolies and corporations.  We have banker bailouts, and government intervening everywhere.  We have public education, the drug war, energy oligopolies that use carbon emissions to shut down competition. Forced Obama ScamCare.  You need permission to do anything.  Capitalism has slowly been eroded away over time, and is now crumbling at the base.

With banker bailouts, huge regulations, barriers to business, and restrictions on freedom, the capitalism we have today is a far cry of what it was in America's hay day.

"You have no idea what you are talking about, and you also misspelled Janet Yellen's name wrong every single time.

>One of the best reasons to have inflation is to help people who are in debt over their heads reduce the real value of their debt. The idea is that if we can inflate our currency by 4%, every debt an american has to any bank, is reduced by 4%.

Where did you ever get this idea? Interest rates for any common American are far above 4%/year, so it's not exactly getting reduced. Also, inflation measures buying power, which means the loan doesn't comparably decrease by 4%, it just means that depending on what you buy, the price of things may cost slightly more.

>If you don't have most of your money as a loan or asset, your just losing money every year.

What? This doesn't even make sense.

>You're government is trying to prevent you from saving your money.

"I think its interesting that in school we learn about what the world was like 40+ years ago, and barely touch current events.  At least that is what my high school was like.  We spend 3 months on WW2, Cold-War, Vietnam etc, but we breezed by anything after the wall falling.

Its only 4 years later when I'm about to graduate that I realize the US is not the same country we learned about in Highschool.  A lot has changed in the last 15 years that I fear the general public doesn't comprehend.  People are so distracted by ""Global Warming Fears"", ""Healthcare Policy"", etc, but glaze over the real problem at hand. The current financial state of our country is in peril.  It's so backwards that the only thing officials and bankers can do is feed the beast.  Every year monetary officials stur the stock markets, what they say and report DIRECTLY impacts the global market.  If Janet Yeller came out tomorrow and said our goal for inflation is %5.5 this year, the stock market would react in an extremely predicable manner.  Stakes are so high right now.  I'm not saying that Jannet Yellen is currupt like some of you would think.  Jannet Yellen is in a giant fucking hole.  She has know fucking clue how to fix this mess and her main priority right now is to keep the economy going in a predicable manner.  The primary goal of the Fed right now is to not create panic.  As long as the stock market is climbing 7% they consider themselves good and will do anything to keep it going like that.  Meanwhile, they are inflating our US currencies to reduce the real value of debt they own.  If the US has 10 trillion in some sort of national debt, they can slowly reduce the real value of their debt.  If you have debt, inflation is the best thing for you, because the actual amount of money you owe is reduced along side of it.  This is basically the US's goal at the moment, and no one in thier right mind in the US is admitting that.  Everyone knows this, but no one admits it, because it would create panic.

This is why the Fed is absolutely terrified of Bitcoin.  If there was a true way to eliminate volitility in the money market they would go bankrupt.  There is no way the Fed could wage their currency war against us and against all foreign countries.  Look how China has begun to act, aiming for a 5% inflation target to increase the growth of their economy.  Now, there are some smart ideas out there of how inflation can actually help a lot of people get out of debt.

One of the best reasons to have inflation is to help people who are in debt over their heads reduce the real value of their debt.  The idea is that if we can inflate our currency by 4%, every debt an american has to any bank, is reduced by 4%.  However, this only helps people if they are in debt.  For a lot of middle class americans who are not in a terrible financial situation, you are getting robbed blind.  If you don't have most of your money as a loan or asset, your just losing money every year.  You're government is trying to prevent you from saving your money.  They want good housing numbers, they want good consumer spending indices, they want their party to look they are doing a good job, even if the long term effects may be bad.  They are power hungry fools who would try anything to get short term results.

tl;dr Bitcoin is disrupting the foundation of our monetary system and I think its up against a bigger fight than a lot of us are making it out to be.";3;2;False;perilprotocol;cmv4wcu;My Russian friend sent me this joke;2pb2ku;https://i.imgur.com/k3odZjv.jpg

All these nascent movements we see are signs that people are getting the idea that something is wrong, but they are still divided, as the status quo wants them to be.  Divided, they have no power.  United they do.  The last thing the status quo wants is to see the 99% figure that out.

In America, a very small percentage  of the population even gets a formal lesson in political science. So, we are indoctrinated informally by mass media and word of mouth that we live in free-market Capitalism. And most of the US leadership and academia agree with that.

In realisty, the US system is really a form of Fascism, if you look that up, and has been since at least the FDR days. So btw, is the post-Soviet Russia, and most other countries.

"Literally taken right from Wikipedia:
Theory one: Keynes' basic idea was simple: to keep people fully employed, governments have to run deficits when the economy is slowing, as the private sector would not invest enough to keep production at the normal level and bring the economy out of recession. Keynesian economists called on governments during times of economic crisis to pick up the slack by increasing government spending and/or cutting taxes.

Theory two: Monetarists, including Milton Friedman, argue that the Great Depression was mainly caused by monetary contraction, the consequence of poor policy-making by the American Federal Reserve System and continued crisis in the banking system.[16][17] In this view, the Federal Reserve, by not acting, allowed the money supply as measured by the M2 to shrink by one-third from 1929–1933, thereby transforming a normal recession into the Great Depression. Friedman argued that the downward turn in the economy, starting with the stock market crash, would have been just another recession.[18]

The Federal Reserve allowed some large public bank failures...

Theory three: From the point of view of today's mainstream schools of economic thought, government should strive to keep the interconnected macroeconomic aggregates money supply and/or aggregate demand on a stable growth path. When threatened by the forecast of a depression central banks should pour liquidity into the banking system and the government should cut taxes and accelerate spending in order to keep the nominal money stock and total nominal demand from collapsing



To recap: #1 states that private industry sucks at keeping the market afloat on its own. #2 states that the government needs to intervene (not capitalist) to prevent crashes. #3 states that the government should balance the boom/bust nature of the economy by controlling input. 

So please, please go ahead and explain how the Great Depression wasn't caused in large part by lack of regulation and government intervetion.

"People love to talk about capitalism and communism without ever defining the terms in any consistent way. 

Here's a radical idea: both capitalism (completely free markets in society) and communism (essentially resource sharing within a tribe with authority vested in tribal elders) are correct, it just depends on the scale you're looking at. Even the most radical libertarian capitalist won't deny that a parent-child relationship should not enable the child to have complete freedom nor should it force children to pay for food from the adult if the adult does not feel like feeding their kids. 

So communism at the family level is accepted by most everyone. But as society grows larger than families, extended families, and tribes, people start to differ in their opinions on which system of value should apply. Total communists believe that the family or tribal values of sharing and elder authority should apply regardless of ""tribe size,"" whereas capitalists believe that at a certain scale we need to respect a different set of values, namely free market values. (There is no such thing as a total capitalist, unless there is someone who believes a child and parent interaction should be entirely capitalist from birth.)

I think the total communists/socialists are wrong because they don't see how large/gigantic tribes have different dynamics and that it's impossible to extend that familial ethic to arbitrarily large groups. Capitalists also err in their rhetoric, though, because they fail to see where communist ideals come from: these tribal instincts that work so well for families and maybe even extended families, and ""feel so right."" 

These overlarge tribes (millions of people) are what F.A. Hayek calls an extended order or extended society - i.e., a society extended beyond the instinctual family size we are mentally adapted to deal with.

Take away centralized power, money, and give control of the means of production to those who actually produce things, and communism will come naturally.   It has to be voluntarily and unanimously chosen by the people, not forced from the top down.

Bank of america for example.  They make their revenue from fees like bounced checks.  This breaks the classical theory of economic good, which states that contracts are beneficial to both parties.  They are making money at their customers expense.   The theory of mutual benefit is true due to efficiencies gained from specialization... that is I can do better by just making shoes and trading them for food then if I both made shoes and grew my own food.

"> As long as capital and the accumulation of capital exist, and the motive of profit that goes along with it, nothing can be fixed.

When people have no incentive to fix shit, guess what happens... Nothing gets fixed. Profit gives people an incentive to obtain *value* which they can freely exchange for things they actually want.

What we have today is far closer to socialism than freedom, and the results are obvious. Democracy gives ""leaders"" the power to decide what you can do, and they sell that power to the highest bidder. It's regulatory capture. As long as people have a government to bribe in exchange for preferential treatment you'll be footing the bill.

That's true, but in regards of Russian Communism the difference is crucial. Communism, traditionally, was intended to go from Revolution -> Dictatorship of the Proletariat -> Socialism -> Communism.

After the revolution Russia stuck itself in the Dictatorship of the Proletariat stage, and never transitioned out of it, which led of course to the creation of the Nomenklatura (a power elite) which controlled everything, was corrupt and was constantly plagued by in-fighting, leading to a highly inefficient an repressive government system.

Marx thought Communism for Germany, basically an educated population with a developed industry and social order.

"Oh god, I see Libertarians.

Exchange is not voluntary if it is the basis of survival. To survive, you either need the means to provide for yourself, or money. But in our world the means to provide for oneself are not publically available - they are privately owned. And the private owners will deny you from accessing them, unless you pay.

So your only choice is to join an exchange system in which you either have to compete with gargantuan corporations that have all the capital imaginable and tremendous market power, or to whore yourself out as a wage worker. What is wage labour? The worker *pays a part of the value he creates* to the capitalist in exchange to access to the means of production. The worker creates let's say $20/hour in value, the capitalist will  immediately take the majority of it. In order to create value, I need capital: Land, ressources, equipment. If I'm not born rich, I need to access the capital that others own, and for that I need to pay them. The worker gets robbed because the ressources and land and means of production are private property.

What is the state? The common good. It provides to the people what everyone needs and what the market is ill-suited for. The entire nation needs roads and railroads. The existence of these things works to the benefit of all. But the number of possible routes is limited, so there can be no freely competing market. So you get the state to provide these things for everybody. The military and justice system are other things that the state is neccessary for to guarantee a democratic order, since corporations are the most undemocratic institutions imaginable. The government is also necessary to make sure that the trade you mentioned works.

The state is always a regulator, otherwise you have corporations poison the entire nation, provide them with life-endangering things, or grind their workers to the bone. So what happens in capitalism? The capitalists see that the state is directly involved in how profitable their particular industries are. So they use their power to influence the state, be it Rockefeller or the Koch Brothers or Soros. A war or generally overblown military for example is in their interest, because it creates a demand for the weapon industry. The war on drugs is in their interest, because all the money the government spends comes back to the capitalist.

As long as capital and the accumulation of capital exist, and the motive of profit that goes along with it, nothing can be fixed. As Engels rightfully concluded, capitalism cannot solve its internal contradictions, it can only push them around. Crisis and poverty are innate to capitalism, and so is the ""regulatory capture"" you are implying. In capitalism the state is always a violent force, since it maintains the structure of private property and private capital. Cops arrest homeless people over getting food from the dumpsters behind a supermarket. Corporations that deal with digital property rights, and the privatised ISPs, push for internet control. There is a giant ""security"" industry that pushes for the criminalisation of everything.

You go ahead with a Libertarian vision of the state, and all you get is

1. the capitalists becoming even more powerful than they are right now and inequaltiy skyrocketing as you eliminate the last remants of the social systems.

2. the immediate re-capture of the state by corporate interest.
