"Coinbase charges a percentage fee. The transaction fees in total would be the same if you bought 70$ today versus 7$ each day for the next ten days. 

Idk why this sub seems to be against coinbase all of a sudden. They have a great reputation and even reimbursed victims of a phishing scam of their website that they had no obligation to. Their fees are up front and very visible, and they protect newer investors from making some of the dumb mistakes people on here have made. Not much use complaining about a 1.5% buy/sell fee when you send your litecoin to a btc addy and lose everything.

**Edit**: /u/balance07 is right the fees are different. I'm sorry about this mistake. If you buy 10$, you'll get 9.01$ and a .99 fee. $100 will be a 97$ with a 3$ fee. 1000$ is a fee of 15$, 985$ of bitcoin.";12;5;False;mattisb;dmk6zko;I will buy 10$ of bitcoin everyday instead of my daily cigarettes !;6y1hx4;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6y1hx4/i_will_buy_10_of_bitcoin_everyday_instead_of_my/

"A lot of people have high hopes for bitcoin, that it will become adopted in mainstream and will draw in a lot more investments than exist currently. 

Because of this most of the people who buy bitcoin are relatively unwilling to sell, even for a decent profit. And if you're on the other end, if you want to buy bitcoin, you have to convince sellers to part with their coins, so bids for coins have to be pretty enticing.

"Pretty much. Although I'm not sure you'll ever lose with investing in BTC if you are HODLing for 5+ years.

I've posted about constant buying of Bitcoin few months back when BTC was like $900. And I've been buying BTC from when it was $200.

I even made opensource utility that now auto buys for me from GDAX. If anyone is interested in app - let me know.

"Honestly, if you are not VERY technical, I would just stick to Bitcoin. Maybe Litecoin... Etherum if you are feeling REALLY adventurous. Everything else - forget it - it's pegged to BTC anyway... and now that Segwit is live I doubt any currency will overtake BTC.

Simply it's network effect - all virtual currencies that are starting now are like startups that want to go from 0 users and overtake Facebook. It just doesn't work like that. It'll take another paradigm shift for something to overtake Bitcoin. And those things don't happen on public offerings.

So - my advice is again - just set Bitcoin autobuy and forget it. In 10-20 years you'll at least have 10x money. Compare that to 7% in stock market and you'll see it's great. Hell, when I was writing in Dec 2016 that I'm autobuying BTC if someone told me it'll be 5x already - I wouldn't believe it. So, who knows... in 10-20 it may be 50-100x and at that point it's life changing money... retirement on $10K investment ;)";20;4;False;howtoaddict;dmkdxgr;I will buy 10$ of bitcoin everyday instead of my daily cigarettes !;6y1hx4;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6y1hx4/i_will_buy_10_of_bitcoin_everyday_instead_of_my/

"Depends what you mean. What /u/livicationmedia describes is not begging the question, but I agree that the original post probably is begging the question (if we take it on face value for the sake of argument anyway).

If I went around without having decided there was a conspiracy, and looked for patterns of *something*, and happened to find something that matches something related to Bitcoin and concludes that because of the patterns there is a conspiracy, then it's the sharpshooter fallacy: I'm disregarding the data that doesn't match anything, and picking the data that does.

But if I believe there is a conspiracy, and my argument is that because there is a conspiracy, those letters is evidence that there is a conspiracy, then  that is certainly begging the question: my argument is only valid if my conclusion is valid, so it rests on itself.

In this case it boils down to whether OP happened to notice a pattern, and from that selective interpretation of company names concluded that it proves a conspiracy, or whether he believed (or pretends to anyway) there is one, and that because there is one, those letter combinations proves that there is one.
