Greetings, The Green Lake Conservancy in Green Lake, WI needs your support to preserve 40 acres of undeveloped land along Green Lake’s shoreline. Green Lake, WI is a natural beauty and one of the deepest spring fed lakes in the United States.  This heavily-wooded property, operated for over 50 years as Camp Grow, sits on Green Lake’s unspoiled south shore in Dickinson Bay and borders Spring Lake’s naturally rich shoreline. Sponsorship of the Green Lake Conservancy’s Partnership for Preservation means you are joining a select group of local donors who want to prevent development of this last existing shoreline on Green Lake that will EVER be available to protect.  Local residents are trying to come up with $1M to purchase the land and seek another $1M in a Wisconsin DNR Grant.  Today, from my understanding they are $200K short.  This parcel is critical for the Conservancy as it allows all people to experience Green Lakes beauty by permitting open access versus property development (large residential homes).  From  a watershed conservation, protecting every acre of Green Lake’s watershed from damaging nutrient and soil runoff is critical to it’s water quality. The riparian characteristics (land between two bodies of water) make this property especially unique. It helps control nonpoint source pollution by holding and using nutrients and reducing sediment to both Green Lake and Spring Lake. The unique contour of this land also makes it highly vulnerable to severe alteration if it is developed. It is crucial that these bodies of water are protected from development that would have adverse effects on water quality. The property also contains several authenticated ancient Native American Mounds that need to be protected.  Following is a link, I've donated what I could, here is the conservancy link for others.  The town has until 12/31 to come up with pledged funding.  Thanks to all that can support.  Following is the conservancy webpage.  http://www.greenlakeconservancy.org/news/partnership-for-preservation







TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE!

We need your pledge by December 31st, 2017 in order to protect this property so it can continue to serve its environmental purpose for perpetuity. A recent appraisal placed a value of  $4 million on the property. We have applied for a grant under the Wisconsin DNR's Knowles - Nelson Stewardship program. If successful, this grant would be limited to 50% of appraised value, leaving as much as $2 million to be pledged by local supporters. This is your opportunity to create a lasting legacy for many generations to come. Pledge your support before December 31st!

"> simply increasing the block size to 2MB, with no action required by wallets/exchanges/etc

Did you know there's a saying that goes 'The road to hell is paved with good intentions'? This is a model case for why this saying exists. In this case, the scenario you just presented as an argument is a fairy tale. Or perhaps more accurately characterized as 'magical thinking'.

Any comparison between Segwit and this fantasy of yours is about as valid as comparing a real person to a fictitious character in your favorite story.

It sounds simple. Just increase the blocksize to 2MB. However, there's no-one who can decide to do that for everyone. Especially since everyone would need to do so at the same time. Especially so for Bitcoin as the lack of someone in control is like the whole point.

It's especially amusing since you claim no action would need to be taken by exchanges and wallet providers. The reality is that they'd be in at least as big of a mess as we have now. Potentially much much bigger.

Why? Well, there is no 'just increase the blocksize to 2MB'. There's _only_ 'Let's release an altcoin with a blocksize of 2MB and start it off with a copy of Bitcoin's ledger at block X'. 

The closest you can get to the fantasy is that someone releases the altcoin, convinces everyone to agree that it (and only it) will be called Bitcoin from now on and that no-one will ever use the old Bitcoin again. The more people there are that don't sign up for this deal, whether due to outright rejection or just due to not caring enough, the more trouble will be the result.

At this point, you're probably thinking to reply about Segwit not being any better and pointing at the mess we've already had. But it's not really caused by Segwit. In fact, we'd likely be in a much worse mess without Segwit.

With Segwit or without Segwit, eventually some well meaning (or less well meaning) person somewhere would have eventually released their altcoin with bigger blocks and convinced a sizable part of the community to abandon Bitcoin and move to their new shiny altcoin with bigger blocks. Without Segwit, it'd most likely be a somewhat bigger part of the community than it is now.";1;0;False;Jiten;drwmdwc;Quote from Andres Antonopolous.;7mdck7;https://i.redd.it/t7ad4k2vre601.png

"Fair enough. But you know, I wasn't looking for something easy to use. I'm a fairly technical person afterall. I basically heeded the developers' suggestion to go download the software and do some testing on the testnet. What I found out is that it's not that the UX is bad, but it actually didn't even work. I tried to open a channel and it was pending-open forever. Then I created another channel and it did open after a while. Then I basically repeated the above steps back and forth, trying to understand how the lightning network works, but nothing works predictably. I had no f-ing idea what's actually happening. When I thought none of my transactions were successful and that I just closed the channel, all of a sudden some random amount showed up in my balance. Then I tried to send some amount over to my other machine with a lightning wallet. Nothing happened. It's insane.

It's not that it needs UX improvement. It's just a piece of dysfunctional software, not ready for testing at all.

And I'm amazed by how many fanboys are here being so gung-ho on the prospects of bitcoin and the lightning network. I have been a big time bitcoin fan. I wanted bitcoin to succeed. When BCH forked off, I sold all my BCH to buy more BTC. However, I don't see Bitcoin Core addressing the obvious problems (transaction time and high fees) that affect everybody. All of this time we just keep hearing that LN will eventually solve everything, but when I actually try to use it and understand how it works, I find myself less and less persuaded by its effectiveness.

Didn't we all want to get away from centralized control? If LN eventually evolves into centralized payments hubs because we end users do not want to open hundreds of channels, aren't we going back to where we came from? I fell in love with bitcoin in the first place is because it's peer to peer, period. These 2nd-layer solutions are complicating everything.

So can someone tell me a simple reason why can't bitcoin address those two major issues without relegating to 2nd-layer solutions? What is so inherently difficult to solve in the main blockchain? Or is it a fundamental design flaw in the first place?

P.S. Someone else said I should be banned from this subreddit. This is exactly what Andreas is talking about. Bitcoin might fail not because of the technology, but because of the politics, the people being so narrow-minded, unwilling to allow others having an opinion of their own, calling FUD this FUD that, even if that opinion is simply complaining that a piece of software doesn't work and that it sucks. Now I understand why so many people went over to r/btc or other subreddits and stopped commenting here, because this place has become so toxic and uncivilized.

P.P.S. Now I'm not referring to you /u/TunaLobster. You are actually very reasonable and you replied me with a fair comment, and that's why I chose to reply to you.

"Marx didn't invent socialism, he just gave it a new name. The ideas that became socialism existed before the French Revolution, but it was that event that created it.

Anyway all those things that existed, no, they didn't exist in their current form before socialism. As a matter of fact many of them weren't administered to by governments or non-profits even after socialism was popular. Police were shire reeves, vassals to a lord. Libraries were private. Fire departments were a form of capital insurance and would often fight each other over territory. The VA? Are you kidding me? LOL. Oh brother, you're delusional. 

And, no, ""nobility"" was the beginning of capitalism. That's actually where capitalism and socialism have their big, original split. Capitalists say, ""This is my land and if you want to use it you have to pay me to do so."" That was England in the 1400s. A farmer barely kept the 10th share of what they grew for self or sale. A socialist says, ""This is our land and we use it for our common good. We have 100 families here we all take care of each other."" One results in a guy in a castle with a bunch of peasants toiling their entire lives to enrich him, church and king and the other results in a nice village that takes good care of itself.

Mao and your other examples aren't socialist. They were *state capitalist* claiming to be socialist just like the USA is a layered republic claiming to be a democracy. In socialism all the people own the wealth of their nation. Everyone has a stake, everyone has an obligation and everyone gets a piece. Looking at the state buildings of those empires vs. the poverty of the individuals you can tell that's not the case in any of the places you mentioned.

Of course, in the nations that I did mention you can see how it can work quite marvelously. Again - Canada, Israel, Vietnam, most of Scandinavia... I mean, they are just doing better at so many things. And yes, people there decide how to use their own capital in all those places. No government man comes to the door and says, ""This car is our capital for to haul the rutabagas."" Your car is yours. Your home is yours.

Very true. I have no idea what the metrics for comparison would be. But it's still a product that people have to believe in and buy into or not. If it sucks and doesn't have cool features that draw the crowd it loses. Whether those features are making great toast or smart contracts. You need them to beat the competition.

Seeds are used to recover your wallet and all its contents in case it gets lost. By default it's a random string of 12 words, but you can choose to use your own custom string that's longer than 12 words.;10;3;False;;drwx8nn;Finally joined the Cold Side;7mtxza;https://i.redd.it/rbypwafaqu601.jpg

"You can't use your own custom string that's longer than 12 words. For starters, it has to either be either 128 bits, 160 bits, 192 bits, 224 bits or 256 bits. Anything inbetween, more, or less, is technically invalid for BIP39.

On top of that, there's a checksum, which is 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 bits, depending on the bit length of the seed itself. Those two values (Seed + Checksum) are concatenated and split into 11 bit chunks, which are then referenced against a [very specific wordlist](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/english.txt) that has exactly 2^(11) words (2048). This means that:

Seed length | Checksum length | Total size (Seed+Checksum) | Words (Total size / 11)| Chance of getting a checksum right randomly
-|-|-|-|-
128|4|132|12|1 in 16
160|5|165|15|1 in 32
192|6|198|18|1 in 64
224|7|231|21|1 in 128
256|8|264|24|1 in 256

So, not only would your ""own custom string that's longer than 12 words"" not work because it's highly unlikely you'll pick random words from the wordlist, but even if you did, you'd _have_ to pick either 12, 15, 18, 21, or 24 words (To be BIP39 compliant) and the checksum would mean it would be very likely invalid.

"**Brute-force attack**

In cryptography, a brute-force attack consists of an attacker trying many passwords or passphrases with the hope of eventually guessing correctly. The attacker systematically checks all possible passwords and passphrases until the correct one is found. Alternatively, the attacker can attempt to guess the key which is typically created from the password using a key derivation function. This is known as an exhaustive key search.

"Where are you getting any of this from? 

Winklevoss Twins invested in BTC and got insanely lucky. They even stated that ""BTC was either total B$ or going to change the world."" Turns out it was B$ but they were still able to buy low sell high.

It doesn't appear that BTC will crash the economy because so few people have invested compared to sub-prime loans. Similarly Wall Street hasn't invested in crypto like they did with the sub-prime derivatives. The bubble will be relegated to a lot of hipster millennials and generation Xers losing their cash.

MSM is warning people against BTC and trying to stop people from getting defrauded. I generally hate the media for fake news but this situation could not be any more ironic. Likewise with bank CEOs warning about BTC too. 

People are being greedy and investing in crypto to make a quick buck. Some are true believers and think BTC will change the world, despite it being 9 yr old tech.

"It was a bubble and is still a bubble but there are big difference between now and 2013.


1. Stealth Phase was when the Winklevoss Twins invested in BTC back in 2013.
2. Awareness Phase has been last few years where co. like Deloitte Consulting were hiring for blockchain skills.
3. 2017 has been Mania phase with 1300% price increase and media hype.

Compared to 2014, there is an entire altcoin market for whales to pump and dump, which is what they are doing at present. Everything went parabolic last month and right now people are squeezing all the profit out of this market before they dump it. This time it'll be for good because all the media attention has attracted all the people willing to invest and because the media has already warned people about the dangers of this market. 

Thank about it. BTC increased in value during 2017 because of a lot of good news such as the Japanese Govt. legalizing it, the hard forks (aka free money) and speculation about futures trading. Do you expect to see this level of positive news in the future? My guess is we're likely to see the opposite which is bad news such as government regulation or taxation.

Logically he is correct and BTC should have been worth less than $10 but people run on irrational exuberance like Alan Greenspan stated. 

With that said, there are key differences between 2018 and 2014.
