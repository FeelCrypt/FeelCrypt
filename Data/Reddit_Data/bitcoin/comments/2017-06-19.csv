I bought my old laptop with Bitcoin back when it was worth about $400 USD. Now I'm finally getting back into it and I'm remembering how much I loved the ride. I never know what's going to happen so I'm always watching the price, but despite the fluctuations, I'm not worried at all. I believe Bitcoin will only increase in value in the long run and even if I'm wrong and it drops to nothing, I'm not going to invest more than I can afford, so the risk will be minimal. I'm just having fun with it.;2;0;False;Chiyo;dj3fx30;Newbies to Bitcoin right now;6huazt;http://i.imgur.com/fx33rLx.gifv
