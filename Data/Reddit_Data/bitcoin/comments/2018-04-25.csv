"As an example you could send money to this address, right now, practically instantly. No bank account required at all.

That's all you need to send someone (not me actually) money. Even internationally.

Sender > money > receiver.

It's a really elegant solution that's rebuilt electronic money from scratch. Got it right the first time.

I've been waiting for someone to post this. Just because isn't mainstream yet, does mean it won't be. Countries like Japan and South Korea, who are always ahead of the world in tech adoption, are using it as a payment method on a level approaching mainstream.

Credit cards weren't accepted on a mainstream level for decades. Bitcoin has been around for less then a decade.

Cryptocurrency adoption rate is still increasing exponentially. People didn't even know what bitcoin was or had completely forgotten about it this time last year.

Once adoption is sufficiently saturated, prices of crypto like bitcoin will become ""stable"" from the invisible hand and other market forces when applied to billions of transactions. Right now scalability is the primary limiting factor to everything you just mentioned.

https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/invisiblehand.asp

Once the scaling issue is resolved and it will be, businesses will not only be able to instantly receive crypto as payment, but they will prefer it as it comes with fewer fees, it's faster, trustless (no bank), and may run dapps or smart contracts within the currency network itself. If they want to, they will be able to settle the payment into cash within seconds as well.

I honestly see the criticisms of Bcash as entirely appropriate and likely not harsh enough.  We're all biased but having a shitcoin named bitcoin while using Bitcoin.com to fool new users with no clue is incredibly reprehensible. 

I don't necessarily agree with the pro-regulation crowd, I think the time will come when people get mad and Bcash goes down but not before movies and documentaries come out profiling the biggest scam in history.  I completely understand people who say ""why let principles get in the way of making money"" and predicting Ver's moves successfully in a profitable way, but I just don't trust him.  I've given them a chance and found astroturfing and a palpable lack of logic nor evidence.

The amazing thing about it is when Bcash gets rekt bitcoin will skyrocket in value because not only do people generally learn about the market en masse when things become ubiquitous but they typically abandon ship when they realize it's sinking.  I think we'll look back on bitcoin at 43% market share as a brief time in history.  The value inherent in 99% of altcoins is incredibly fleeting.

The few real applications, anon-coins & fixed-market-purpose coins (casino, medical, etc) will have a life span and evolve but they were built on bitcoin and gauged by bitcoin.  I hope the new people realize all that as soon as possible, it's an uneasy thing seeing a flow of ignorance followed by anger when they realize what happened.  People are going to be pissed lol..

Look at this page explaining the total supply of Bitcoin, there is not a single place where it talks about the price of bitcoin versus goods. I'm purely talking about how Bitcoin's money supply acts over time.

It does not cost $40 today to send a Bitcoin transaction. 

You want in on a secret? Wall street owns most of Crypto. Maybe not the coins themselves, but 85%-90% of the Crypto businesses. Coinbase, Circle, Poloniex, Abra, pretty much all of them. Not Bitmain though. Thats Chinese. But here is the deal, Nasdaq owns the Digital Currency Group (DCG)look at DCG's portfolio. ran by Gary Silbert. Big Wall Street Hedge Funder. Check out his bitcoin fund, GBTC. His Bitcoins are selling at a premium of $16.8k right now. Lightning Labs is also being funded by the DCG. 

The Lightning Network is being built By Wall Street FOR Wall Street. We are on the preface of something huge. Wall Street is about to turn on the firehose into cryptos. But not into Bitcoin Gold, Not into Bitcoin Private, Not into Bitcoin Diamond, and not into Bitcoin Cash.  They are going to unload into Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ethereum.

My working theory is that Wall Street did a test. They started flooding their money into Bitcoin in September, november and december and it got clogged up. It ran up the price, but the blocks were being filled up to 1MB and slowing down the network. Its true. Decentralized Blockchains are not very efficient. But the Lightning Network is on the Brink of coming online for Wall Street to use. The Lightning Network isn't for you and me. We can do on chain transactions no problem. Its for Businesses like VISA who process Millions upon Millions of transactions, and they can just settle on LN and do a single on chain transaction at the end of the day. And that way it wont clog up the Bitcoin Network for the rest of us. 

The Chinese realize this and they have co-opted Ver and a few others to trick people into buying up bcash with Bitcoin. You can't watch that video of Ver saying Mt. Gox is Solvent and say he isn't a conman.  There are many other coins that do ""instant transactions"" better than bcash. You want a fast coin for daily transactions, use Digibyte. Blazingly fast.

No one is talking about ""monetary inflation"".  We are talking about inflation and deflation which always refers to the price of goods.  Why would you ever default to that?  If you want to talk about supply inflation or deflation, you must use the word ""supply"".

Inflation includes any reason for prices to go up.  Supply inflation(printing money) would just be one factor that could have an effect on inflation.  The price of bitcoin is not based on total bitcoin in existence increasing or decreasing.  Its based more on demand for bitcoin which causes wild swings in inflation and deflation(buying power).

Lighting Network is for Big Businesses, who have millions of transactions a day, and then they can settle on chain ONCE, at the end of the day. So they don't clog up the network. There isn't enough traffic to warrant bigger blocks. YET.  When the blocks are getting filled up by the Joe Schmoes of the world, I am sure Bitcoin will upgrade to a bigger block size.

All those insane quotes you hear about btc being $500,000? When they go into detail it actually requires hyperinflation of USD. The purchasing power of 1 dollar decreases therefore the price of commodities increase. An apple will also be $25.

So that 500k actually only has todays purchasing power of lets say 100k. (arbitrary number.) 

If the dollar crashed I would predict btc to behave more like gold during the 2008 crash. It dropped about 30% over 1 year then recovered and then some afterward as people wanted a good place to park their money.

Take a look at the term capital flight. This would occur if USD destabilized. Super rich companies and foreign investment would run away, probably to China. I keep mentioning China for a reason.

There is no reward  for running a node unless you mine, then you can get block rewards and collect transaction fees.

I think, technically, it is. And I don't just mean that is BTC the original ticker. The latest core client has come from an unbroken chain of developers working on the original client. Individual developers were removed at times, but there was never anything like a hack that let another group of developers overthrow the current group of developers. Despite all the controversy, it's been a pretty peaceful transition. And yes, some developers have been removed, Gavin Anderson comes to mind for example, but all of them had stopped committing code to Bitcoin at the point where they lost permissions.

The 0.10.0 client came out 3 years before any of last year's forks, and was also before the controversial segwit was added. There was no doubt in anyone's mind that this particular core reference implementation *was* Bitcoin.

"If you really want to undestand, stop looking at the supply of the currency and start looking at things priced in the currency.  Wealth...you know, ""stuff"", isn't fixed in supply, if I double the amount of stuff for sale in the maket and don't double the amount of money along with it, then the only possible response of the market is that all the stuff must double in price so more wealth can be traded using the same fixed amount of currency. 

The amount of wealth (aka stuff) in the world is not fixed in supply and cannot be. Price stability of stuff is achieved by actively managing the supply of money by increasing and decreasing the supply to appropriately match the amount of stuff it's representing, that's something we call the velocity of money.  Since bitcoin's supply cannot be managed, then stuff cannot be kept at the same price over time, it must fluctuate wildly, prices going up drastically anytime more stuff is created and dropping wildly anytime less stuff is created.  Inflation and deflation of the currency supply are how the prices put on stuff are held relatively constant over time.  Bitcoin can't do that and thus can't be a good currency.

If you want stable prices on goods, then you absolutely must be able to manipulate the money supply to keep the value of goods stable.

"Since you don't seem to have any idea, Bitcoin was created by Satoshi Nakamoto. The ""original"" working client that Satoshi coded himself was version 0.1. He remained project leader through development to version 0.3.16. There is no doubt, whatsoever, among anyone, that version of the software Satoshi was running is and was Bitcoin. BTC today is an unbroken continuation of that blockchain in every way. The present version of the reference client is version 0.16 and it's backward compatible with the V0.3.16 node that Satoshi was running as lead developer. BCH, on the other hand is not compatible with any previous version of the Bitcoin software, not V0.1, not V0.3.16, not V0.16 or any of the other 50+ versions the reference client has grown through. Satosh Nakamoto, with his unquestionably ""real"" bitcoin node running 0.3.16 could not interact with the BCH chain, at all. Likewise, no BCH transaction would be recognized by Satoshi's 0.3.16 node.  

Conclusion: Yes, there is a real Bitcoin and BCH is not it. 

So your opinion(s): 

>there's no such thing as an existing definition of the real bitcoin.

>Fundamentally they're both correct because there is no absolute definition, it's all about perspective and what in your opinion is the direction 

>there is no fundamental absolute truth which chain is the truest one and both groups have the right to claim they are correct

"> If you double supply of goods and keep money supply static, then prices would halve not double.

Whoops, correct, I misspoke, but the point stands, price instability.

> What I’m asking is why can’t you have prices slowly deflating as GDP and wealth gradually increases (as it tends to do)?

Firstly, it's not slow, wealth doesn't slowly grow, it fluctuates constantly; yes it grows slowly as a long term trend, but the short term and seasonal fluctuations matter much more.  The money supply needs to be elastic so it can be managed to keep the cost of goods stable.  If you can't manage the supply, the cost of goods would have to swing constantly and that's a huge problem.  Suppliers don't mind raising prices, they hate lowering them, prices are ""sticky"" and resist downward pressure while going up quite easily.  This is why ""inflation"" isn't so bad but ""deflation"" is terrible.

To put it simply, managing the money supply works, letting the market force prices up and down constantly because the money supply is fixed doesn't; we know this from history, it's why we have the system we have now and it's why we abandoned gold as money.  Fixed money supplies lead to wild swings in the markets causing depressions and booms; after moving to fiat where the supply could be managed, we've eliminated depressions, now the markets swing far more gently and we have bubbles and recessions rather than booms and depressions.  Fixed money supplies cause price instability and make markets work poorly.  This isn't theoretical, this is known history.

BCH did a lot of things that weren't part of the original plan. The emergency difficulty adjustment code that was added specifically broke a rule Satoshi made to help keep the difficulty stable.

I think most people would agree that blindly following the ""original vision"" would be dangerous. For example, Satoshi's original white paper said one CPU one vote. It never even imagined dedicated mining hardware. Things change and the software evolves both when the network grows and when the network is attacked. In fact, Satoshi himself added the 1MB block limit. Who's to say that if he were still around, that he wouldn't still be happy with that limit.


> Why would BTC associate with Bitcoin at all if it doesn't increase block size?

Why? I think that's pretty clear. The 0.10.0 client came out years before any of last year's forks and before segwit was added. I doubt you could find anyone who would argue this wasn't Bitcoin.

"Exactly.

The Ethereum community had collectively decided to call the hard fork ""Ethereum"". In a software sense, Ethereum classic follows the original pre-fork protocol. Whether the name change is right or wrong is a matter of opinion. But Ethereum classic is not so much a debate about technology, but rather policy. And this is one of the reasons why I am still a proponent of Bitcoin. And that is, Ethereum classic stands for immutability for morally questionable centralized governance. In Ethereum, decentralization lost and became Ethereum classic. 

In Bitcoin, decentralization is still winning. Despite opportunity after opportunity of invalidating ill-gotten or stolen coins (e.g. MtGox, SilkRoad, Bitcoin Ransomware, accidentally lost coins, etc.) the attitude and policy remains stronger than ever. The fundamental principles have not yet been bent to favor fixing unwanted transactions over decentralization. And that is really important. More important than anything, in my opinion, if you want to call it money and not ""magic credits"".

The fact that Ethereum changed in order to ""rob"" (or in their opinion, ""fix"") a person's balance, tells me everything I need to know about their fundamental beliefs. I am not interested in a system that isn't bound by both immutable mathematics and by immutable wallet balances.

What's the point if someday, either a central power or a collective power decides, ""meh, I don't like you. I'm going to make your bank balance $0.""?

">The current system where every user is a network node is not the intended configuration for large scale. That would be like every Usenet user runs their own NNTP server. The design supports letting users just be users. The more burden it is to run a node, the fewer nodes there will be. Those few nodes will be big server farms. The rest will be client nodes that only do transactions and don't generate.

This pretty much describes what the lightning network is, and again, directly goes against the idea of bigger block sizes. If block sizes continue to increase, their will be no ""rest of the nodes"" because everything, including transactions, will be done on server farms.

>I anticipate there will never be more than 100K nodes, probably less. It will reach an equilibrium where it's not worth it for more nodes to join in. The rest will be *lightweight clients*, which could be millions.

What I am describing is the Bitcoin ecosystem. You're not paid in it; you can't pay your rent in it; you can't pay your mortgage with it; you can't buy groceries with it; you can't buy everyday needs items with it. The handful of merchants that currently take bitcoin don't *hold* them as Bitcoin because its volatility makes it a liability, which means they use an intermediary to extract their money... much like the traditional banking sector. And if you want to go and purchase Bitcoin (as you are not paid in it), you need to go to an intermediary to convert your dollars to internet pesos. And if you then want to pay your mortgage with a bitcoin, you need to go to an intermediary to convert your internet pesos to dollars. Each of these steps attracts fees and takes more time than existing banking infrastructure, which makes statements like this:

> Sender > bank > money > payment system 1 > payment system 2 > international payment system 1 > ... > sticky tape > bank > receiver.

Straight up silly, because btc requires the exact same intermediaries to be of any worth to anyone.

"I've seen chimps who think they're people. Their opinions do not change reality. A chimps DNA is 99% the same as people but that difference prevents fertile intercourse with people. This functional incompatibility is overarching, no matter that both are primates. So it is with BCH. BCH is very similar to BTC, both are viable crypto currencies (primates in this analogy), but BCH is functionally incompatible with the living Bitcoin blockchain created by Satoshi Nakamoto. The opinion of some BCH fans that they are holding real Bitcoins is a cigar smoking chimps delusion, and it's being nurtured by Roger Ver's deceptive behavior. Indulging such fantasy, as you are doing, by not ""deny them agency and the ability to claim they are the real, better vision of bitcoin because they don't need my permission"" might feel unbiased and kind to them, but it's also unfair to the majority of network participants such as node operators, the economic majority of Bitcoin enthusiasts, the developers who've guided the phenomenal growth of Bitcoins value through improvements since Satoshi disappeared, as well as all the businesses who've built their brands on a specific implementation (and reputation) of this years old project, not to mention being rude to the legacy of Satoshi Nakamoto who designed a brilliant system where change depends on consensus.        

> Let's say that some time in the future bitcoin forked again and both chains would be compatible with previous versions. Which one is the real bitcoin in your opinion?

You are describing a contentious hard fork. In such a scenario the two chains would not be compatible with each other, however one (but not both) of those chains would still be compatible with the pre-fork chain. That's exactly what we have with BTC, it's still compatible with older versions while BCH is not. The economic majority might go with either, as we saw with Ethereum, but in that  specific case the new branch was given the old name and the original branch was renamed ""Ethereum Classic"" by, and because there is a leader, Vitalik Buterin to make such decisions on behalf of the community. Bitcoin no longer has such an authority figure, so by default the unchanged branch retains the unchanged name. That's entirely consistent with both the technical functional compatibility I've explained, as well as the traditional naming conventions applied in all opensource software development.

"> Nonsense. If you defraud someone by promising bitcoin but delivering btrash, then it's simple fraud and you are liable.

This is an interesting question. If such issue ever were presented in court I wonder what the judge would do. Let's say that person A says it was offered a bitcoin on some website and paid for it and got bcash instead. Is that a fraud?
First you'd have to have an absolute definition of bitcoin. BCH crew disagrees with the current paradigm and claims their coin is closer to the true bitcoin vision. BTC crew says their arguments are horseshit. And portion of community agrees and another disagrees.

So what would judge do if there is no real brand protection in this space, there are regular forks everywhere and depending on personal definition and individually chosen specific criteria bcash can be real bitcoin or btc can be real bitcoin in many people's eyes. For people ideologically rooted in one or another this is unacceptable that both could be it but the judge doesn't care about personal opinions, biases, preferences and ideological differences, he has a to make a ruling based on something tangible.

So in my opinion judge will tacke this issue from another angle. Because he sees both groups shouting ""no u!"" he abandons that route and instead asks how the transaction looked like exactly.

Example 1: person A paid person B 9k for 1 btc. Got 1 bch instead. You cannot argue that person B acted in good faith here even if they're ideologically inclined to claim or believe that bitcoin cash is real bitcoin. Person A clearly paid a price very close to the current volatile rate of exchange of the btc coin but got bch coin instead. Clear fraud.

Example 2: person A paid person B 1.4k for 1 bitcoin. Person A says they were cheated and they wanted ""real"" bitcoin. Person B says in their opinion bitcoin cash is real bitcoin because (litany of reasons). This is where the whole thing gets muddy. Is the person A aware that btc goes for 9k and they were possibly buying something else? Did person B tried to trick person A into buying bch instead of btc or simply honestly acted in good faith because they truly believe that bch is the real bitcoin? Did person A specifically requested btc coin or just ""bitcoin"" in general? Is person A just trying to be cute and bully person B to give them 1 btc for a huge discount using the court? In my opinion the judge will try to gauge the motives of both parties and whether someone was trying to trick the other person. What if the person selling bcash bought it from someone else claiming it was bitcoin and was sure they own bitcoin and was selling it in good faith? The list of possible angles goes on and on but I don't think in this case it will be declared a fraud at all. A fraud is a wrongful or criminal deception intended to result in financial or personal gain. If you paid 1.4k and got a coin that is worth 1.4k then there is no real financial gain here tbf. Judge will probably just think it was a mistake or bad communication because cryptospace is batshit crazy and rife with ideological differences.

>If you publish false misleading information publicly, them you could be sued.

"Yes, you can still be angry, /u/Cthulhooo is doing the usual ""reddit contrarian"" argument, and while I love a good contrarian argument, this one lacks the depth required for a proper proof (and as I will demonstrate, the argument is invalid). Malice behaviour is detrimental to any economic system, contrary to those people that hate libertarians, libertarians don't celebrate an ""anything goes policy"", libertarians celebrate free-market solutions that people voluntarily abide by.

Anything that interferes with a free market is actually very dangerous to libertarians, probably more so than it is to a system that can fall back on a powerful state government. In this case, Roger Ver is intentionally misleading newcomers or people naive to the crypto space. If Roger Ver was merely making another variation/altcoin, then Cthulhooo would be correct. This however, is not the case, Ver is (a) attempting to steal a brand, and (b) is doing this by intentionally misleading people. BCH forked from BTC, BTC still has the developers from before the fork, and there is a strong consensus among the community on which is the true bitcoin*.

These malicious behaviours are in violation of free markets, you can't have a free market where fraud is acceptable and where you can't grow a reputation because people steal brands and identities. Free markets only work were there are the actors are rational, and the actors have good information (hopefully this point is intuitive to most readers, I don't have space to flesh this out without creating a 10 page essay). The typical libertarian solution to fraud is civil law, and in cases where offence is too mild to bring a law suit, it's seen as acceptable to use social pressures.

It's also absolutely foundational that people speak up and say something or the fraud will continue and will get worse, so the ""You can but it's not gonna change anything"" response proves to me that this person has not actually considered the problem in depth. It is clearly a bad thing to have this issue going on, and it is important to do something about it. If being angry motivates you to write a post or act in a way that will better the situation, then be angry.

*To further this point, in case someone reading this sides with Ver, that BCH is the true bitcoin: If I make a new currency called ""the true American dollar"" and I made it out of gold and silver (as per the constitution), I may be correct to say this is more closely aligned to what the founding fathers defined as money, but you bet your ass the US government would be coming after me for calling it an American dollar, and if I tricked someone into taking it, they would be rightfully upset if they were expecting actual American dollars. Here's another example: Anyone can fork the major currency and claim they are following it most closely to the white paper, what validates one claim over the other? It's the back end, the developers, the community, and the progression of a continuous project. BCH has an early adopter that claims he is better at following a white paper, contrary to the vast majority of other early adopters.

"It actually doesn't work both ways.

Bitcoin is a consensus-based protocol. When an alternative protocol is created that is not compatible with the existing protocol, the alternative is called a fork. BCash is an entirely new protocol that has larger blocks and incompatible with all of the Bitcoin nodes that existed before BCash was invented.

Bitcoin, before BCash existed, continues to be compatible with the thousands of Bitcoin nodes that worked and still work today despite all the changes that allowed for new features to be introduced.

On top of that, the 400+ developers that worked to build what Bitcoin is before BCash existed, continue to develop on what Roger and other scammers call ""Core"". There is no ""Core"", it's just Bitcoin.

The alternative, BCash, is a fork and a phishing scheme intended to deceive unsuspecting users. There are many fraud attacks on Bitcoin that are not related to Bitcoin. Just like there are scams on Ebay or Facebook, there are many in the Bitcoin world.

As problematic as they are, there are two advantages that Bitcoin have over BCash. And that is, technical superiority in the form of incredible developers, and the internet - where fraud schemes get exposed and ridiculed in the long run. That includes the banking system, corrupt government programs, etc. as long as people are diligent. Information is so easy to find these days, and illogical or inferior arguments will get crushed over time.

"If a group wants to call ""Tomatoes"" ""Onions"" then they can and no one can stop them. What you call a tomato may be for someone else an onion. But, even then, this comparssion is invalid.

Bitcoin Cash is a continutation of the original Bitcoin, where's Core is Bitcoin with additions and isn't going according to the whitepaper. So one can argue that Bitcoin Cash IS Bitcoin while Bitcoin Core Isn't Bitcoin as it should've been.

So, because they come from the same origin but on different pathways, I can argue that one pathway IS Bitcoin as it should be and the other is some mutation. You can argue that I'm wrong, and both statements are valid.

"**Subjective theory of value**

The subjective theory of value is a theory of value which advances the idea that the value of a good is not determined by any inherent property of the good, nor by the amount of labor necessary to produce the good, but instead value is determined by the importance an acting individual places on a good for the achievement of his desired ends. The modern version of this theory was created independently and nearly simultaneously by William Stanley Jevons, Léon Walras, and Carl Menger in the late 19th century.

"Price stability is not a requirement for something to be a currency but it's one of the most highly desirable features for a currency to survive. when you get hyperinflation, even with strong government controls, people abandon the currency for practically anything.

Before I go on, I expect the bitcoin fanboys to point to weinmar republic and veneuzuela and zimbabawe and that the USD has lost 10% over 10 years or something. These are important things to note but the reason they are important is that the hyperinflation examples are rare and also illustrative of the importance of price stability. USD does fluctuate as do all fiats but it is rare that when you go grocery shopping, that the price of the bananas you just picked up will cost 10% more by the time you pay for them at the checkout. So before you fall into that trap of argument, think about why you're going down that path.

So - bitcoin is highly unstable in pricing. That makes it problematic. Most people need to be able to work out their expenses each month to survive. They rationally don't factor in that rare currency crisis event in their calculations. Or if they do, they can't afford to hope to mitigate that risk by having 5%+ monthly fluctuations in their incomes or expenses. that's why the populous can't just accept bitcoin as their source of income or their means of expenditure. And because they can't do that, mass adoption is highly highly highly unlikely if not impossible without government force (eg if the US government decided one day that they will only accept bitcoin as a method of tax payment - note it has to be the only acceptable method because as I stated above, if you have a more price stable alternative, like fiat, then then populous will stick to paying their taxes in fiat because they have more comfort in knowing what that ends up costing them).

You need mass adoption for the price to stabilize. But you need price stability for the population to voluntarily adopt it.

I guess technically it could be called a currency if you have one transaction per year in bitcoin but it's not a currency in any meaningful way. And it's unlikely to ever be.

It's a punt. And potential insurance against a crisis (assuming that's where people go in a crisis). But right now it's not really a currency. And as much as I hate fiat, I don't think it will ever be. It can never replace fiat because you're forced to pay taxes in fiat. And get government benefits in fiat.

"One clarification on this. Stocks increase in value based on the *expectation* of future earnings. So even if they don't issue dividends, the *ability* to pay dividends in the future is the underlying principle behind a stock's price.

Just like Amazon did not turn a profit for over 10 years - the expectation of profits is what set the price.  Every company needs to eventually post a profit.  Oddly, with stocks, issuing a dividend can be pushed-out indefinitely (at-least until growth opportunities cease and the company reaches total market saturation). This doesn't change the fact that the stock's price is based on the future expectation of a large dividend.

Berkshire doesn't issue dividends, but its value goes up because Berkshire holds companies which *could* issue dividends if they wished. ";1;0;False;GabeNewell_;dxyf4pg;This is NOT OK. Upvote for visibility;8ek5c0;https://i.redd.it/w8sjxhnnsut01.png

"Yeah, the global, agorist crypto economy would like a word with you.

Just because *you* don't use it as a currency doesn't mean it isn't used that way.

Crypto is a class of its own. It has properties that are similar to currency, investments, and commodities, but it also has properties that is different from those things.

This is uncharted territory, and our current culture has yet to develop a good grasp on the underpinnings of the implications that crypto will have on society.

We are living in a time where we now realize a new possibility and like with pretty much every modern field of science, are approaching the realization that our current models of economics and finance are incomplete.

I also do not use it as a currency, and I also don't solely hold bitcoin.

I think of Crypto as the financial instrument that is emergent from the information age, just like stocks (or at least common stocks) were the financial instrument that emerged from the industrial age.

People will probably lose a lot of money, but the ones who lost the most during the crash of the 20's were the people day trading.

Most of the people who invested in a diversified portfolio of stocks in the 20's, and managed to hang on to them through the depression might have had a few stocks end up being toilet paper, but many of the companies weathered the depression and ended up being very valuable.

I can't tell the future, but that pattern seems too close to be coincidental, especially when you saw similar things happen when humanity transitioned from an agrarian economy to an industrialized one.

My plan is to do my research, invest widely, in small amounts, and frequently, and then not really think about it until it's time to retire. I have other investments as well to rely on for that in case crypto doesn't pan out for one reason or another, but I really doubt smart contracts aren't going anywhere, so my money is on shit be changin', yo.";1;0;False;eitauisunity;dxx5elj;This is NOT OK.

No, you need the ability to manipulate the supply, which you can't in bitcon.

Gold was never stable, it's why it was abandoned.

It is too volatile because it is too small a currency. Not enough people are using it to make it stable. If more people use it it will become more stable, meaning more people will use it. Or the opposite could happen. While I agree with this point I disagree at the same time because feedback loop.

I've used various store fronts that accept bitcoin via bitpay and it's brilliant - but I can't help but feel longterm it isn't doing anyone any favours in terms of being considered adoption. I see a lot of adoption posts saying ""company X now accepting crypto Y"", only to find when I click through to the post/article, they've simply integrated a cryptocurrency payment processor (i.e. bitpay) as a payment option. I was under the impression that REAL adoption is accepting actual crypto (i.e. I pay for my meal by sending [crypto] from my personal wallet to the restaurants wallet).

In my view, crypto payment processors are not helping with adoption...do you agree/disagree - why?

I also don't see how they have a sustainable (long term) business model - so if you have any insight to that I'd be interested to read on it, I found one other [thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2r91d5/how_the_hell_does_bitpay_profit_or_even_break_even/) around 3 years old that asks the same thing, with no real conclusion - yet bitpay is still around - so they must be doing something right - but I do not believe they make enough with fees.";1;0;False;sh20;dxxpa2u;This is NOT OK.

>I'd REALLY like my Lambo this year.

Absolute hypocrite. Nowhere did I say money is everything to me. You *literally* said you make more money than you need. You're projecting **REALLY** hard in this whole thread about your own insecurity about how you make your money, while at the same time bragging about how you make money in basically every other thread I've seen you post in.

You are an insecure man who's itching to criticise your own behaviour in others. Except I'm not farming bitcoin with bots, I'm trying to help my GF pay off her college loans and lines of credit. I'm nowhere near making ""more money than I need"" yet here you are, telling me I'm shit for making a fraction of the money you make. What's relevant isn't how you trade, it's how much money you're taking off of someone else. This shit is a zero sum game for traders, all the money is someone else's money, but apparently you feel no guilt because it's all Roger Ver & friends' money, and they really don't need as much as you.

If it makes you feel better, I DCA'd buy-ins from 9300 to 9150 overnight when it was at 9400 and it dropped to 8900 by the time I woke up. LEL. I already made it back, but hey, I traded like an idiot which you seem to advocate for, happy friend?

Honestly, I doubt any of this has anything to do with how I trade. I think you just have a compulsive need to shit on how other people trade to puff up your own ego. I think you go out of your way to squeeze every dollar out of every trade, and you just want to shit on someone who's potentially a competitor.

I opened a bunch of links and they're about counterfeiting prevention and machine readable features. None of these help a person verify coins in their day to day.

Counter-party risk usually leads to inflation and fraud.

People had little choice, moving off the gold standard was enforced by governments. Not being able to print money is annoying for governments.

">Doesn't that make it even harder to verify the value?

No. The verification of a coins value is done by coin security features, not metal assay. Coins exist in the first place because if you were just trading blank discs of metal it would be too easy to forge a metals value, and melting down and testing every coins metal content is far too costly in time and energy. coins exist to allow an instantly recognizable verification of a coins value by a trusted 3rd part, a mint.

>But if you do it for a lot of coins can't you process them all more or less in one go, making it still profitable?

Only if you assume scale will drive the efficiency above a given value. The opportunity cost alone would make it economically unfeasible simply to try and scale. If you have resources enough to get millions of coins, build a factory for shaving, and employ hundreds of workers, you could make far more money doing something else with all those resources than to try and shave coins deliberately designed to be unprofitable to shave. Not to mention it would only require one disgruntled worker to whistleblow and take down the whole operation. It's not a realistic threat.

>That is no longer gold and leads to counter-party risk/fraud.

Gold currency has always involved counter-party risk, that's why coins exist, to stop people being defrauded over fake gold.

you've now also changed the goalpost from ""is not inflationary"" to ""doesn't involve counter-party risk"". that's not what we were talking about, we were talking about why gold isn't used as currency anymore if inflation is bad for currencies, and then going through a list of arguments of how gold isn't used despite of its apparent superiority to fiat.

People didn't abandon gold in favor of fiat because of ""coutner party risk"" so its not a relevant counter argument.

>I opened a bunch of links and they're about counterfeiting prevention and machine readable features. None of these help a person verify coins in their day to day.

The new £1 is loaded with features that are readily identifiable to the consumer. It's 12 sided, micro lettering on the rims, bimetallic, holographic, all these things make it much harder to forge and much easier to identify a real coin. It also has hidden security features that will make it easy for the mint to track down forgeries.

Perhaps.  I will say that it's certainly not a boring, comfortable, mainstream life that I lead.  Though I think you are confused about the experimentation.  Philosophers and scientific generalists probably do far more experimentation than the more narrow focused types.  Every moment of life offers an opportunity to try something out to see what happens and learn from observations how to refine theories.

> if I see your name attached to some great work of systems theory one day, then you will have made your point.

That's not how a healthy decentralize system works.  It's not made by single individuals trying to make a name for themselves through making big projects that they have control over.   Most of us big picture, cultural architects are almost never known, except by those who are very close to us.  That's because we work from the bottom up, not the top-down.

My field is indeed pretty much everything, but with a focus on growth and development in systems.

I am not dissimilar to Buckminster Fuller, but am less interested in material designs and more interested in complex networks of individuals of all types (biological, synthetic, ideological, etc.).

"> Attribution is mostly irrelevant because ideas are always a complex combination of previous ideas. It's sometimes nice to be able to find someone who proposes an idea who you can ask about it in person, but in reality our ""sources"" are always ALL of the data our brains have collected over the course of our entire lives.

This is the most anti-science viewpoint I've ever heard a self-professed scientist ever claim. Attribution is non-optional. No room for debate on that point. Attribution is literally the only way that sources of information can be vetted for the quality of their methods and data.

I have to keep voucher specimens of my study organisms and make them available to the community. I have to provide raw data sets. I have to attach my *real name* and those of my collaborators, including e-mail addresses, phone numbers, and workplace addresses to documents so that people can can get in touch with us if they want to check our data or methods. I have to cite other sources of data or ideas by name and date of publication, with enough information to allow people to go to a local library and find a copy. And this is what all scientists have to do. ALL. Not just STEM, but economics, social science, political science, everything.

If you fail to do these things, you are not a scientist. If you fail to do these things, you are committing intellectual dishonesty and doing the broader scientific community a disservice by obfuscating your efforts and identity, making it difficult to replicate and independently verify your work.

Going to school to learn how to do science is not just some profiteering industry that sells overly expensive pieces of paper that say ""M.Sc."" or ""Ph.D."" on them. While academia has its problems, it nevertheless teaches you absolutely essential skills and etiquette to participate in the world's community. Some countries even provide this training for free, but I know many people on this sub hate that damned socialist nonsense. Damned if you do, damned if you don't, haha.

The scientific community has rules, and those rules exist for very good reasons. You established at the beginning of this discussion that you believe communities should not have rules that limit what can be published. You believe that these rules are censorship. But these rules enable the community to exist in the first place.

Despite having rules, the scientific community is healthily decentralized. It exists across every country, across universities both public and private, and even industry and government. Publications are becoming increasingly open-access, stored in digital format on servers across the world. It's the best community we have for figuring stuff out.

In that particular live debate however (when he accepted bcash is his project) the interviewer made him so mad, he couldn't lie anymore and showed his true form because he lost self control. True fucking honest fraudster form of Ver.

"I think we’re going to h e to accept ASICS for the hashing power efficiencies it can provide and work on decentralization through trying to further decentralize ASICs. Samsung will help. And mini versions that have comparable efficiencies (if this is possible) would help. Like that little router thing bitmain sells for litecoin mining, although I don’t know how competitive it is. Or maybe all the utility power stations of the world throw otherwise wasted electricity into miners, and we live in a world where those are all decentralized too.

You can never make a single currency decentralized.  That's because for it to be **a** currency it needs a central control/rule.
