">They didn't purchase it in bitcoins.

I understand that. Now pls recognize my argument that it could be any currency, not just $, and if a goverment would have bananas as a currency you would have to trade it for bananas first before buying the lambo. I just don't see where this matters at all in the discussion. Bitcoin wants to take the power away from the goverment, of curse it's not a legal currency that's one of its features. Whats the point of your argument? It doesn't need to be a legal currency.

\>  they buy bitcoins with dollars, hold those bitcoins(meaning less bitcoins are circulating in the economy, which can be bad for a currency) until future price levels increase.

It's not like [fiat money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_money), it's more like [hard money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_money_(policy)). On one side you have a possible infinite supply of fiat money around the whole world vs a finite amount of 21 Million bitcoins.  Monetary value with a fixed suppy is likely to always go up but with fiat the additional value is stolen by banks.

You literally don't want free money (monetary value) because some bankers wrote up a bullshit story to convince you that it's good for you to give them your money.

It's ok to wait 3 years before you spend your money. Whats bad about that? Why do we need to stimulate the economy NOW under the condition that we all lose a shitload of buying power?";1;1;False;Drollian;evu5o67;Well yes, but actually no;cki5pl;https://i.redd.it/l8rphrpnyqd31.jpg

You don't get it do you. Bitcoin wants to be it's own currency. It's not, because you still need to exchange it for a real currency. That's why it matters. Crypto will never overthrow fiat money when it relies on fiat money to make it's purchases. 

> It's ok to wait 3 years before you spend your money. Whats bad about that?

What's bad about that? When people don't spend their money, they zero money becomes income for other people. When I buy a car, that money becomes the salary of joe salesmen, who then spends that money on bills or maybe even invests. When people can't spend money, usually because they fear if they spend now then they missed out on future increase in price level, the economy stalls.";1;1;False;McBeeff;evu7trb;Well yes, but actually no;cki5pl;https://i.redd.it/l8rphrpnyqd31.jpg

"> buy a house ever and everybody will just eat stuff from the garbage bin just because the value of their currency rises so they can die rich. Thinking like this has nothing to do with reality and you have to be completly deluded if you think this will happen.

Not this extreme. Of course people will spend their money, nobody is saying they wont. They will simply save more then they are spending, which ends up being bad for the multiplier. Go learn some economics, and study some history.";1;1;False;McBeeff;evua329;Well yes, but actually no;cki5pl;https://i.redd.it/l8rphrpnyqd31.jpg
"> They will simply save more then they are spending

Of course but if the Value rises 10x and people spend only 20% of it, which isn't much, then they would have spent more than double of what they could have spent using fiat money.

I think you are the one who needs to go back to scool here buddy.";1;1;False;Drollian;evuaidx;Well yes, but actually no;cki5pl;https://i.redd.it/l8rphrpnyqd31.jpg
What you are describing is called deflation. It's also bad for the economy. IF you seriously think yuou have it all figured out, that massive increase in the value of money will solve the worlds problems then you are more ignorant then I thought. Seriously we have already experienced what happened when deflation occurred in America less then a century ago.

"> Bitcoin wants to be it's own currency. 

Bitcoin wants nothing, it's a neutral piece of software.

>the economy stalls

It doesn't, the opposite will happen, people will have more value to spend. The spending of each earned coin just shifts a few years but in long run this doesn't matter. 
Look: If you have 100 trillion transactions a year and you do every transaction every year 3 later you will still have 100 trillion transactions. You dont get this do you?

You maybe think ""LOL YOU JUST DONT UNDERSTAND"" but I think it's completly retarded to think that everybody will live on the street and no one would buy a house ever and everybody will just eat stuff from the garbage bin just because the value of their currency rises so they can die rich.

They didn't purchase it in bitcoins. Bitcoin is recognized as a commodity, not a currency. The problem is people take bitcoins as a financial investment, they buy bitcoins with dollars, hold those bitcoins(meaning less bitcoins are circulating in the economy, which can be bad for a currency) until future price levels increase. This is by definition not a currency. The lambo transaction was not done in bitcoins, but bitcoins helped gain actual currency(dollars) to purchase the lambo.;1;1;False;McBeeff;evu3i25;Well yes, but actually no;cki5pl;https://i.redd.it/l8rphrpnyqd31.jpg

"> Are you serious? They are buying a selling it in a financial trade market. That's not the same kind of spending. There is a meme around bitcoin, HODL is literally saying HOLD bitcoin. The opposite of spend. IDK what paradigm you are operating under but people are not spending bitcoin and that is one of the central issues.

Wrong. There are literally people driving around with lambos with ""bitcoin"" written on the licence plate. You can call them idiots but they sold their btc. What do you say about that?

"Not necessary but let's pretend it was like this. Why does this change anything? It could be euros too or if you find someone who takes bananas you could take bananas to buy the lambo.

If someone would take a stinking pile of garbage you would also just buy the stinking garbage pile and then give it away as fast as possible.
