"When I look at the Chinese and Japanese education system, I don't think about how Asians are inherently more intelligent. I'm sure that an African, European, American, etc. would be equally well suited if brought up in that environment.

Of course, there are several Psychological theories concerning the mental development of humans. Some studies have shown that less than half people can reach the formal operational stage, the stage of Jean Piaget's cognitive theory that allows or abstract thought and reasoning. But I can't believe that more than half of humanity is *inherently* stupid (which, of course, isn't explicitly stated. this deficit of abstract thought may have a big deal to do with nurture as opposed to nature), and neither can psychologist; even they argue about the validity of Jean Piaget's theory.

Then, of course, there's also the fact that intelligence is extremely hard to define, and also there, psychologists are arguing about how to define it.

The same thing also applies to morality. According to Kohlberg, who was inspired by Jean Piaget's theory, only 10-15% of people can ""think outside of the box"" in terms of morality, meaning that they understand that laws and social rules are not always just. While this may be true, I don't think that most people are *inherently* unfit for this kind of thought.

Nature vs. nurture is always a big issue in psychology, and if you look at history, you can see that ancient Greece produced lots of great philosophers who were great at abstract thought. Now you could say that they were inherently smart enough to have a democratic system, but it may also be possible that they became great at philosophy and abstract thought because they had to be involved in politics, because they had to argue.

Now, of course, not everything is nurture. Women in the Victorian era didn't get as extensive an education as men did, but that era still produced very good female writers, so it may be argued that those female writers were inherently more intelligent than  other women of their time.

So, going back to the calculus example. It's not all nurture, but it's not all nature either. You may have a super smart child, but if you don't teach him basic arithmetic, he won't be able to learn calculus (slightly oversimplified but still true enough), so it has to be a mixture of nature and nurture. We simply don't know how much nature is needed and how much nurture. As another example, C.P.E. Bach may have been a good composer because he inherited J.S. Bach's ""music genes"" or because he learned from his father.

TL;DR: We don't know if people are inherently too stupid to learn calculus, or if the way they're raised and taught determines how well they'll be able to handle calculus.";7;0;False;Codile;cy99lq0;Edward Snowden on Twitter: Imagine if the government went after corruption as hard as it goes after guys who run filesharing sites.

"Current mass surveillance practice is literally to collect everything - every email, text message, phone conversation, location of your phone - and store it, without a warrant. That's NSA and GCHQ. NSA decided that collecting everything didn't count as collecting until they looked at what they collected, so once they get a warrant for something, they can look at the whole corpus that is already in the database. Plus even to that it appears they decided there are exceptions where they don't need a warrant to look at a US Person's data. 

Contrast that with ""[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated."" You say it is ""far more complex"" to view current practice as incompatible with the 4th Amendment, but I don't see what interpretive approach one could take to that text whereby collecting everything a person says or does and storing it up until you want to look at can be seen as consistent with its dictum.";2;1;False;ChagataiChinua;cy9dsim;Edward Snowden on Twitter: Imagine if the government went after corruption as hard as it goes after guys who run filesharing sites.

"> You have the ability to speak out against the government, you can say anything you want and you will not be arrested for your words.

> However, other people also have the freedom to get to work, to not have traffic impeded forcing people to miss out on parts of their lives because YOU have something to say.

> A free speech zone allows you your freedom to say what you want and it also allows other people the freedom to ignore you and continue to live their life without you impeding them.

That is very true, and I partly agree with you. However, the point of demonstrations is to speak your voice where people will hear you. When you force those demonstrators to go where people won't hear them, you are impeding their freedom of speech. Let's say buses were still segregated. If you don't allow black people to demonstrate near any buses or white neighborhoods, you make those demonstrations useless.

> As for mass surveillance, it is far more complex than ""clearly against the spirit of the 4th amendment""... I mean according to that stance you would think that the Constitution clearly wanted militia groups in the USA to be allowed to make nuclear bombs

Um. No? Obviously, the Constitution didn't want militia groups to have that power, nor did the framers know that such power may available to future humans. It seems to me like you don't know how ineffective mass-surveillance is against stopping crimes. If you looked at it from a technological perspective, you would know that false positives are impossible to prevent and that even 10% false positives are very generous. Then there's the fact that the bad guys will always have encryption, even if tech companies decide to remove encryption from their devices, so now you're just recording the tech-illiterate people's lives. Obviously those people won't pose a threat, such as the one you're referring to. Sure, they may shoot someone, which is already bad enough, but with all the talk about guns online and fps video games, it becomes nearly impossible to filter out actual intent from nonsense talk.

That aside. The fourth amendment protects people against unreasonable search without probable cause. I'm certainly not against surveillance if it is used against crime suspects, but you can't just make everyone a suspect either...

> The moment I hear someone complain about free speech zones I imagine an angsty 19 year old who has no concept about how the world works.
