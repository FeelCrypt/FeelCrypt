"Not the same. The inputs are not the same for a dvd and a vhs. They also aren’t comps because technology changed the delivery and pricing more than anything else. You have to use things they don’t change inputs, but prices change.

"I just looked up milk. Only inflated 29% since 2000. CPI shows a 52% increase over the same period.  

Looks like poultry was pretty close to the CPI. Beef was much higher, and pork was much lower over the same time period.  CPI being an average seems to check out.

I wouldn't look at luxury shirts and hats.  Too susceptible to marketing strategies. See what a button down shirt at Walmart costs in comparison.  But even that alone isn't a good measure of the average.";1;1;False;kdawgud;ew9ic5p;US labels China as currency manipulator;cmu8u4;https://i.redd.it/f306a4hmeve31.png
"Not sure where they get that bu milk used to be 1-$2 now 3.50-$4.

That’s not 29%

I can’t find the online calculator but there is a good chart here - https://comparegoldandsilverprices.com/news/economics-101/dollar-devaluation-since-1913/

"are you fucking retarded? 

purchasing power is what the money ""has."" And more circulation of money means more money supply. 

>More dollars in circulation lowers their purchasing power (price).

lowering purchasing power INCREASES prices

are you retarded or what?

learn some fucking economics before you start yapping about shit you know nothing about.

also stop making crypto blockchain look bad by posting shit you don't know anything about";1;1;False;sean_incali;ewa3m60;US labels China as currency manipulator;cmu8u4;https://i.redd.it/f306a4hmeve31.png
