"> This is obviously a lie since the correspondence makes clear that you told him that it had already been worked on while the machine was still in transit. It's impossible for you not to be lying.

Careful.  There is no actual proof that it was still in transit other than the word of the OP and an email he supposedly sent.  Note that there was no response included disputing or confirming this.  The OP may have been mistaken in that email like he was mistaken in every email where he mentions wiring $25k instead of $20k or that it uses Windows XP as opposed to Windows 7.  But more importantly he doesn't say he worked on it, he says the issue has been resolved.  Whatever that was they may not have needed the unit in their possession to know the solution to the issue.  It probably wasn't the only unit with that problem.

Of course given the rest of everything that happened I wouldn't be surprised if they were lying.

"Here's his full original response in the thread:

Hi all. My name is Jordan Kelley and I am the CEO of Robocoin. I'd like to take this opportunity to share the facts, and share, simply the reality of the relationship with Andrew and Robocoin. 

To date: Robocoin has shipped units to 18 countries. We are helping to fascilitate the buys and sells of bitcoin in 14 currencies. The following is a disappointing story of a disgruntled, impatient buyer:

1. Andrew bought a Robocoin kiosk. 
2. Shipment was delayed, something that happens in hardware, especially with a brand new company trying to satisfy enormous demand. It was out of our control. The new polymer Canadian notes that have a huge clear window through them would be rejected by Fujitsu's bill dispenser. We had to wait for Fujitstu to finish an update. It was something that I truly hated (I'm a guy who wants to make everyone happy), but we still attempted to communicate every step of the way. 
3. We delivered the kiosk. Andrew took receipt of the unit. 
4. The kiosk had some hardware failures. My support team worked with them every step of the way. We spent hours on hours working on solutions. My support team, dedicated to their job, was met with constant belittlement and noncooperation from Andrew. 
5. Andrew lost patience and decided he was over it. He shipped the kiosk back to Robocoin's manufacturer. 
6. He then demanded a full refund after the kiosk was delivered, worked on and ready for the fix that would have put him right back in business. 
7. Robocoin has a restocking fee and Andrew refused to agree to the restocking fee - claiming that he was due a full refund. The contract states, explicitly, that Robocoin does not offer refunds. 
8. Andrew would not come to any type of terms. He chose to threaten as opposed to negote. We offered to resell the unit - he declined. That is not the kind of way we like to do business. 
9. He sent out a horrible tweet - saying that I'm crooked. Something I take personal offense to. Again - we delivered his kiosk, we provided him support. We did our part and we're ready and willing to go above and beyond. 
10. I am always happy to come to a swift and easy resolution. It's disappointing that business is conducted this way and even more disappointing that my company - a team that works every day, tirelessly to the bone, to develop great solutions to enable the world to buy bitcoin - is dragged through the muck. 

I take personal responsibility on this. This is 100% on me. I failed to get Andrew's kiosk in working order, unlike the other 65 out an live in the world. I failed to solve Andrew's problems. 

Our team continues to launch kiosks all over the world. We continue to execute on making amazing solutions for the bitcoin world and will never stop.

I think in this case they would subpoena them to court....Robo-idiots wouldn't show up and the judgement would go for the plaintiff immediately. Even if they did show the judge would crucify them based on what I read.

They could also get costs to appear, their shipping back, rent agreement costs.

They would likely get everything back they paid. 

The flipside of this is that they still may never pay them...but you could turn it into a judgement and eventually an arrest warrant on Josh. If he stepped foot in Canada they would arrest him at the border until it was paid.

Yah, so there is a major bug in the ATM: if you're buying BTC, there is a super simple way to make the ATM eat your money.

The ATM simply has to have a low BTC balance. When the user attempts to buy more BTC than what's currently available, the ATM asks for the user to display the QR code where the BTC should be sent. When you show the QR code, the ATM says there is an error and that you should scan your QR code again... you can keep scanning all day long, but it will keep coming back with the same error. Eventually the transaction will time out and it will tell you that it will print a receipt (and a paper wallet), but it doesn't. I'm talking to the support people.

The way this should be fixed is that the bill recycler should reject the bill if the inserted amount exceeds the BTC balance of the ATM.";3;0;False;btcthinker;cla4aoo;The Great Robocoin Rip-off: How we lost $25,000 buying a Robocoin ATM;2jakg4;https://docs.google.com/a/metalabdesign.com/document/d/1aL_b_Eq6WKv_u_ZKiPNPBXz5UbuMhi2Xm1AjdsgVER4/pub

Why? Because it's pointless? Inflation can happen for many reasons, but just on the reason of an increasing population, you will find that you need more money. Individual wealth in terms of what a dollar is worth is on the decline, but only because there are more people, so we need more money to go around.

Bitcoin has the same issue, except its method is less intuitive; you have more people adopting, so you just break the coins into smaller pieces. You're still suffering a loss of value per unit, but instead of using positive numbers (which is better for individuals, since a dollar to them is a positive thing they can more easily understand), you're giving them fractions of a bitcoin or a percent, which ties it to how many people are using it and hence, less intuitive as the number keeps getting smaller and having to adjust itself. It makes the holder of the cash do the math that they're not good at, in a fashion that isn't as readily understandable.

"> That's a massive claim to make without any evidence. Meanwhile, it's easy to find MS's written policy on support of older products.

Yeah, and it says that they are willing to make custom contracts.

From Microsoft's ""[written policy on support of older products](http://support2.microsoft.com/gp/lifepolicy)"":

> Microsoft understands that local laws, market conditions, and support requirements differ around the world and differ by industry sector. **Therefore, Microsoft offers custom support relationships that go beyond the Extended Support phase.** These custom support relationships may include assisted support and hotfix support, and may extend beyond 10 years from the date a product becomes generally available.

Who's to say what the limitations of the custom support contracts are? Do you have a Microsoft source to cite that does?

"IRC and forums do ***NOT*** equal commercial support, in any way, shape, or form.

IRC ""support"" is a crap shot, you never know if someone will help you, if any one remotely knows of a way to fix your problem, most offered help won't actually fix anything (might even make shit worse), no one is obligated in any way to help you, and it could very well likely take several hours to actually find a solution let alone the time it takes to fix it.  Downtime kills, be it servers or embedded systems like ATMs.

Compare that to the support available to RHEL users who can just call up support at any time of the day, 365 days out of the year;  Their support ninjas know their distro inside and out, and will be able to fix any issue in a matter of a couple hours, if not less than an hour; And to top it off they are obligated by contract to make sure your shit is 100% right again.

IRC and forums are good for power users who don't mind getting their terminal dirty, it is not in any way an option for commercial enterprises.

"Jesuswithoutabeard has already addressed the ""consumer"" issue, so I will just address the jurisdiction point.

The question isn't simply whether, as a matter of Canadian law, this transaction is covered by Canadian law.  Countries pass all kinds of laws that purport to bind foreign nationals, and which their domestic courts will enforce, but which are not as a matter of private international law recognized as enforceable due to a lack of jurisdiction.  Unless these guys have a lot of Canadian assets in their company name, a judgment in Canada is useless unless the USA will recognize and enforce it.

To give an extremely simplified statement of the common law rule, a court has jurisdiction over a person present in the jurisdiction, or who does business in the jurisdiction through a branch or agent.  Now, before you focus in on the latter part of that test, doing business in the jurisdiction is more than merely doing business *with* the jurisdiction.  Offering to sell products to foreigners doesn't give each of their home countries jurisdiction over you, and it would be absurd if (as an extreme example) selling a pair of jeans online to an Iranian gave Iran jurisdiction over you.  So more information would be needed about these guys' business structure before a clear answer could be given.

Virtually all countries claim what is known as ""exorbidant"" jurisdiction, which basically means that their courts will hear cases that they would not have jurisdiction to hear at common law.  But such jurisdiction is not recognized internationally and judgments entered in reliance upon it cannot be enforced.

Oh, I would also mention that if these people had their terms written by anybody with half a brain they will include a USA choice of courts clause, whereby OP agreed that any claim would have to be made in America.

There is also a practical issue, that OP would be incurring a lot of extra legal costs if he were to sue in Canada and then try to enforce in the USA.

TL;DR It isn't about whether Canada thinks it has jurisdiction, it is about whether the judgment could be enforced in the USA as the place where the debtor is.";7;2;False;iamplasma;cla2xze;The Great Robocoin Rip-off: How we lost $25,000 buying a Robocoin ATM;2jakg4;https://docs.google.com/a/metalabdesign.com/document/d/1aL_b_Eq6WKv_u_ZKiPNPBXz5UbuMhi2Xm1AjdsgVER4/pub

"Are you familiar with the background?

In 'short', someone paid $20k in December 2013 for a machine to arrive and launch in March (for which they also rented a place locally to put the machine). It was delayed until like July or something, and he got a damaged machine. Spent months on the phone trying to fix it. Still didn't work, 9 months later he's out $30k and he's never had a single day that the machine worked.

So he returns it, insured. WHILE shipping, they then say they found the issue and fixed it. Note, the machine hadn't even arrived yet. Clear bs. It then arrives and they say it's damaged, although the insured shipping makes no notice of this. Clear bs. They then say they're just a reseller, his issue is with the manufacturer he never dealt with, trying to push off liability. Clear bs. They then tell him he must pay $5k to 'restock' a damaged item, which is illegal as customers have a right to a free refund in the case of a damaged-on-arrival product. Clear bs. Then they tell him he will be made whole, but only after they sell the returned item, as if that's his concern. Absolutely no legal basis for this. Clear bs.

Of course, all of this happens by email where they ignore his mail for weeks, and reply here or there with bs promises and stories, meaning all of this wasn't resolved after 10-11 months of hassle, and again all this time he's out $30k and got absolutely nothing (except 50 hours of mailing, calling, arguing and a whole bunch of stress and a failed business opportunity).

"I had a similar problem with a well known company called BMC.  The sales manager never responded to emails with our issues, would assign a tier-1 tech who would spin on problems for a week before responding/escalating, even simple issues surrounding error responses.  Did I mention this software package cost >$150k which was paid out fully after professional services came in and deployed our product.  We sat with them going *back and forth* for 9 months before we gave up and demanded our money back.  They refused, we simply smiled, said thank you, and walked to our lawyers office.  The lawyer wrote a nice demand for our funds,the next day we received 50% back and an offer to resolve the issue with free professional services  .  At this point damage was done and we only demanded the other 50% back as we had a competing solution already in place and performing correctly.  

During this time there were no, insults, mentions of parties, or reasoning of lost income.  We knew the risk and accepted it when we bought the product.  Turned out our risk came back to bite us, no need to sue for damages -- however if they had not returned our money we would have sued and damages would have been factored in and BMC would have been in for a world of hurt.

So bottom line, there are errors on both sides of this story.  Robocoin is not in the clear, but *Metalab should have been aware of the risks and should have not put the full amount up front*.  That is just not how business with large sums of money works.  As far as I am concerned, all of these problems are surrounding metalab's infancy of a company and lack of leadership experience.  Had you had real executives working the project, there would be no public backlashing (does not look good in front of a judge), there would not have been a lease until a working unit was in hand, there would not have been any ""surprises"" about customs.  This is what you plan for when you deal with physical goods being delivered from a foreign country.  Further, you **never pay up front without someting tangible at that high of a cost**.

Those ATMs were probably designed and built years ago.  Just because it's technically still supported doesn't mean you should be building new systems with it.

"You need to grow up a bit. And also be very careful with what you say about Robocoin and Jordon. Defamation lawsuits are a thing.

Late product? So common that it should be expected in any business, much less a start-up. Again: *It should be absolutely expected.* If something ever arrives on time, in any business, it's a frickin' miracle. If you can't afford the resulting expense of potentially several months' delay, you shouldn't have attempted the project.

Rental space in the bar? That was your decision. Your problem. You even started renting several months before the expected delivery. You didn't include a clause in the contract about getting out of it if something happened to change the project's plans? Your fault, not Robocoin's problem.

Hold up at customs? Happens in every business. Someone didn't tell someone else something, and it may take weeks or months to sort out. You decided to pay $2,000 for your own solution instead of waiting for Robocoin's channels to do it? Your decision, your expense.

Price drop of the machine even though you hadn't received yours yet? That's pretty common. That's part of the price you pay for early access.

The product was buggy and hard to work with? Welcome to the world of start-ups.

I will give you that the whole returns mess sounds like a legit gripe, and demonstrates Jordon's immaturity and/or disorganization and/or lack of liquid resources to handle such things. And they probably need more than 1 support person, given Frank's reputation.

But most of your problems don't seem all that out of line, or were created by your own inexperience.

I don't know Jordon and am not associated with Robocoin in any way. I realize this was a bad experience and Robocoin certainly isn't Amazon or Apple, but I feel you really need to pull back on your accusations and frustration.

I really want to put Lamassu bitcoin ATM's inside of Book stores and coffee shops.  I feel bad for Robocoin trying to pioneer this space, but bitcoin ATM's are the big elephant in the room that bitcoiners look at and go ""Well, I mean, IIIII would never use it, but when the next bubble comes people will FLOCK to it"".... which is naive and really a mess.  

Any smart bitcoiner is going to use Coinbase/Circle, or if they want anonymity, craigslist or Localbitcoins.  Its not hard to figure out that unless bitcoin atms have a negligible spread and standard $2.50 fee per transaction, that these ATM's will go nowhere.  Its a shame, but people are talking to their states about how to fix this problem, and frankly until it is, these ATM's are garbage.

Our local ATM folks don't even disclose the transaction amounts.  Apparently we have the highest used atm in the country, but until a bitcoin ATM experience can look like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zeMLcf66Y8) no one will use it.

"If you really do not know how to obtain your own API keys you really should not be running a bitcoin based business, period.  If you yourself can't handle it you should hire someone who's able to configure this kind of thing.  Honestly anybody even considering starting a bitcoin business should be well versed in dealing with command line interfaces, editing obscure text files, SSHing into random machines, taking apart defective hardware that's been damaged in transit and fixing it yourself, etc.  These aren't consumer retail products!

If you're not technically capable yourself you need to partner with someone who is.  My partner and I both are used to at least basic hardware hacking and he's a software engineer who writes custom scripts and whatnot while I'm also able to configure our *nix systems whether it's a full blown server, a raspberry pi, a beaglebone, or some shady router, even though I'm a friggin physician by training.

Basically, if you would have difficulty setting up your own bitcoin node on your own custom server you should probably not try to deal with any other bitcoin related hardware.  You need to be able to configure your own hardware and troubleshoot hardware problems yourself because there *will* be hardware failures and issues and as a business you'll be the one replacing failing hardware parts because it's not practical to constantly ship problematic hardware back to the manufacturer.  I know other miners who will desolder and reflow mining boards themselves with new mosfets to fix defective boards!

Frankly, you guys got in way over your heads.  If you want to make money off of bitcoin but you're not technically literate you're way better off just buying bitcoins unless you want to either learn all about hardware and software or hire someone who already knows.

Surely that would have a) restored confidence in the product, b) cut down the back and forth time significantly, and c) cost less money in the long run.

"I think that much of this is overblown, unprofessional, and clearly shows poor business acumen.  I am willing to take downvotes in pointing this out, as I don't believe you understand any of this.

First, the delays all appeared in order.  Yes, you were frustrated that the dates were not as promised, as anyone would be.  But bill validators do need to be upgraded for major currency changes - I have seen this for years in the slot machine business.  That is entirely normal, and I am sure no judge will ""side with you"" on some kind of damages here.  Additionally, shipping cross-borders around the world is a tricky process, and it is often the case when dealing with a provider who does not have experience with a border, or even when they have some experience but not with a particular problem that is encountered, there are delays.  Again, no judge will find any damages there.

You, as a business man, chose to rent space without having in your stock the device you wanted to place there.  That is no one's fault but your own.  This is horrible business practice.  It does not matter if you wanted to ""reserve the space to prevent it being rented out to others"" or any other reason.  You chose to pay for space without having an item to place there in your stock, and the months spent paying for empty space should be thought of as tuition in learning some very basic business fundamentals.  You don't put your money on the line under expectations of others unless you have contractual repayment (which you would never get for something like this where delays are always expected).

Afterwards, you received a buggy product.  That is unfortunate.  It does not sound like these are very good products in general, and you were one who experienced that.  Hopefully the terms of your purchase include refund terms or the country you are in has statutes that provide for minimal refund terms which you can use.  In that case, a judge will certainly agree you should have the exact money you provided to that vendor.  But no more.  All your other expenses were your choice, not theirs, and no judge will reasonably grant you any of them.  And if you don't have preexisting refund terms or statutes in your favor, you will not even receive those (though you can keep the kiosk).

However, you have done some real damage to your case with this post.  You are attempting to poison the jury pool if jury trial is possible here (I don't know the statutes).  You have made claims against Robocoin that they owe you money for expenses you made unrelated to them.  You are showing publicly that your business does not have good financial skills, something that is typically not a good thing if you are trying to get into a financial industry.  This shows so many bad choices on your part, and any judge who reads this (and they will if this proceeds in any meaningful way) will start to form negative views of your part in this entire exchange, as it is hard to see how confidence can be maintained in nonlegal recourse from here on.

Look, I'm not some Robocoin mole trying to tell you this.  They appear to be scum in their more recent dealings with you and probably should not be trusted in general.  But your earlier frustration with delays may have triggered some of your negative interaction, and most of your expenses appear to be due to really poor business skill by yourself.  Someone needs to point that out to you.  You don't seem to know what you are doing.

EDIT: And I think it's probably important to stress this point: the issue that you caused - the loss of money on a monthly basis due to very poor business practices - was the entire source of all your problems.  I don't think this was made clear enough above.  Because you were losing money, the very understandable and normal delays that you experienced became this anxiety-ridden experience for you and your partner.  You got reasonable responses from your supplier, which turned out to be honest responses (this was no BFL scam), you received your equipment, and the process of bringing it online encountered some more delays.  This is where you exploded.  You could not handle servicing delays and demanded what may be a request for a refund outside any attempts to bring your product up to a working condition - because you were bleeding money.  You may have sabotaged the normal progress of the contractual obligations because of this.  Others, even in this thread, have reported that the servicing works to get it functional - with other minor issues - but you could no longer wait.  You have to understand that this is all your fault.  You should never have put yourself in that position.  Delivery should have been to your business premises (yes, I realise you weren't a real business - this is part of the problem).  Setup should have ensured it was brought to a working condition there and was movable.  Then you could have procured a location and moved it.  You cut corners, hoping to get a money making machine.  You took the risks.  Now you are upset that the risks were bad ones.  You soured the communications because of your own poor judgement.";1;0;False;ex0du5;claftv3;The Great Robocoin Rip-off: How we lost $25,000 buying a Robocoin ATM;2jakg4;https://docs.google.com/a/metalabdesign.com/document/d/1aL_b_Eq6WKv_u_ZKiPNPBXz5UbuMhi2Xm1AjdsgVER4/pub

Hope you learned not to count your chickens before they hatch from this experience. You don't announce anything nor get into any responsabilities based on uncertain information.

Very rushed on your end, after you get the ATM, it could be defective, you may need to develop custom software on it, you may need to learn about licensing, actually learn how to manage it, maybe place some infrastructure on the backend to manage replenishment, get the bitcoins at a fair market price WHEN you are ready to go, etc. etc. very very rushed way of doing business. *sigh*

"I've helped work on Project Skyhook, which is a $1000 Bitcoin ATM: http://projectskyhook.com

Orders ship within 2-3 weeks. Shipping to Canada is no problem, customs is no problem. Assembly is in Portland, Oregon, so it's a quick ship to Vancouver. We've shipped hundreds of units, dozens to Canada (possibly over a hundred by this point).

Setup is completely on the owner's end. Owners don't need the company to configure the unit, and the company doesn't need to run servers for them. Skyhook ATMs use blockchain.com for the wallets (using accounts the owner creates independently), and the exchange price source is the owner's choice, all controlled through the interface. This isn't to avoid having a setup phase - it's to allow owners to have complete control over their money, because then it's a trustless system (the source code to the ATMs is open and auditable: https://github.com/projectskyhook).

I'm astounded at the prices on some of these ATMs. For $25,000 they could have ordered 24 Skyhooks (a little padding for shipping, which I believe can be palleted to save money). Bitcoin ATMs shouldn't cost the down payment on a house, IMHO.

It's also not a ponzi scheme to pay off old debts or investor rounds like Mt. Gox or whatever. Skyhook was completely bootstrapped by the founders (no VCs) and a result of that (and careful burn rate management) is now profitable, despite the low price point. The cofounders have been using some of the money (and their free time) to help clean up and build out a new hacker/makerspace in Portland that's going to be awesome.

"I can totally relate to this, I've got two ATMs and I've had most of the mining hardware out there at one point or another. So far a large % of bitcoin related products have significantly under-delivered on their promised features or quality.

Even though there is a lot of great, exciting stuff going on in the world of bitcoin we need to remember that a lot of the companies out there working towards lofty goals and making big promises are essentially making things up as they go.
   
Many of the people making these promises have little to no previous business and/or entrepreneurial experience and may be out of their depth. We need to recognize that it's not easy to break new ground and build a business from nothing in an industry where there often are no precedents to follow.   
  
However its important that consumers protect themselves and hold these companies accountable.  Here are a couple things to keep in mind before purchasing a bitcoin related product:  
  
* If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. You aren't going to get a 3 month ROI on that new piece of mining hardware or ATM. 

* Don't pre-order anything. Ever. Crowd-funding is an amazing model that opens a lot of doors to some interesting new products and technologies. However without some oversight, eager bitcoin users are easy pickings for scam artists. The fact is, there is start-up money out there for smart, motivated people with good ideas and a good plan. If a company absolutely must use crowd funding to sustain their development, they should release and alpha or beta version of their product and price it accordingly (ei. Minecraft).

* Even if the company does deliver what they promise, your results from a pre-order are rarely as good as waiting for an in hand product before you place your order. Across the board, at least some delays are almost universal. It's practically impossible to do the math on your ROI in an ecosystem that's changing this quickly if you don't know EXACTLY when you will receive your purchase. On top of that, the second batch of any product has usually been a bit more refined and quite a bit cheaper.   

* Be aware that almost anything you can order comes with a degree of risk. This week's All Star could be next week's Gox. Just look at [Moolah](http://blog.moolah.io/2014/10/14/moolah-is-having-to-close-its-doors/).

Doesn't matter what your contract says. If it says you can keep Andrew as a slave, sorry, not going to happen. Some clauses in contracts are voided, and a clause that says no refunds for defect products is one of those. It simply doesn't fly, consumer protections overrule that clause, and any judge will happily point that out for you in court.

Perhaps instead of being on the defensive, consider this: you've told Andrew over and over again that he will be made whole. What's stopping you? Andrew is not your partner, he is your customer. He does not have to pay for 'restocking fee', those DO NOT APPLY for defect items and customers by law are not required to pay it or oblige to such clauses in contracts. His refund also is in no way shape dependent on the success of your business, he paid, you provided (late) a broken product, he returned it, you return the money. That's it. He does not have to wait for you to resell that product to get his money.

You still need to take responsibility for the delay, which was a breach of the terms of your contract with Andrew.  The delay being out of your hands is immaterial to your customer.  The fact that you dropped your price before you shipped the unit and then refused to refund the difference is astoundingly bad business.

>He then demanded a full refund after the kiosk was delivered, worked on and ready for the fix that would have put him right back in business.

This is obviously a lie since the correspondence makes clear that you told him that it had already been worked on while the machine was still in transit.  It's impossible for you not to be lying.

>Robocoin has a restocking fee and Andrew refused to agree to the restocking fee - claiming that he was due a full refund. The contract states, explicitly, that Robocoin does not offer refunds.

Legal threats are a clear sign of this, though that line is usually crossed much sooner. It sucks, since (I'll assume) you want to satisfy all your customers, but sometimes that just isn't possible.

Once that point of no return is crossed, the cost of placating the customer starts ticking upward. I like to offer immediate full refunds at this point, but if you delay, the customer gets more and more angry and more difficult to get rid of.

Hopefully you can learn from this experience. Customers are the best thing in the world right up until they turn on you. Then, they are your worst enemies. As painful as this is, it's always easier to deal with angry customers immediately and completely by making them whole as soon as possible. This sale was lost long ago, and now you're losing many more by letting this drag on.";28;1;False;PurplePotamus;cla2a58;The Great Robocoin Rip-off: How we lost $25,000 buying a Robocoin ATM;2jakg4;https://docs.google.com/a/metalabdesign.com/document/d/1aL_b_Eq6WKv_u_ZKiPNPBXz5UbuMhi2Xm1AjdsgVER4/pub

"> Shipment was delayed, something that happens in hardware, especially with a brand new company trying to satisfy enormous demand. It was out of our control. The new polymer Canadian notes that have a huge clear window through them would be rejected by Fujitsu's bill dispenser. We had to wait for Fujitstu to finish an update. It was something that I truly hated (I'm a guy who wants to make everyone happy), but we still attempted to communicate every step of the way.

As someone who runs a successful business... 

If I tell a customer that they can expect their product by a certain date, then my suppliers don't live up to their word and get me the ordered materials to make that product in time for the agreed upon delivery date, that's on me and me alone.  You made the promise to a customer and you need to do your best to live up to that promise.  Sometimes things beyond your control happen.  That doesn't mean you get to pass the blame down the line to your suppliers.  It means you need to do your damnedest to come up with some creative solutions.  This is one of the things that make the difference between an OK company that you may want to do business with again and an amazing one that the customer will absolutely call again the next time they have a need you can fill.

This is 100% shameful lie from Wilkinson regarding XP. All Robocoin ATMs run on a hardened Windows 7 instance standardized through a domain over a VPN. We digitally sign our binaries and enforce that it is the only thing that can be executed at run-time and have spent considerable amounts of thought locking down and securing the physical device itself - far better than any normal ATM (let alone bitcoin ATM) on the market today. In fact, our security measures are part of the reason for the transient issues he was experiencing with the hardware peripherals. Do we like using Windows?  Hell no, but to maintain compatibility with legacy banking hardware it is a necessary evil.

"I do agree this is a horrible scam but here is the bigger issue I have and its with your business plan and the simple math behind it.

You are down $20,000 from day one and counting...could make 5% of that as an investment instead but ok.

Next you sign a $250 a month lease instead of finding a busy location and 'selling' the owner on it helping their business somehow. Even so $250 a month is HUGE and at best it should have been something like a % of profits maybe.

Anyhow...

Lets say you make $2 a transaction...

You need 4-5 a day to pay off the rent on the location.

Then over the next 3 years you need to make back your 20k so 6k a year (no counting the machine breaking and paying to fix it nor counting the expense of trips to fund the machine etc).

So you need another 10-12 uses a day.

Nearly 20 people need to come use that machine every single day just to break even in 3 years.

20 people a day for 1000 days in a row.

My gut says even if you got a machine on day one you would still be DEEP in the hole.

And this is just me guessing with zero knowledge of your per transaction profits.";48;4;False;coding_is_fun;cl9ycsc;The Great Robocoin Rip-off: How we lost $25,000 buying a Robocoin ATM;2jakg4;https://docs.google.com/a/metalabdesign.com/document/d/1aL_b_Eq6WKv_u_ZKiPNPBXz5UbuMhi2Xm1AjdsgVER4/pub
