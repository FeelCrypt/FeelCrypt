">  thats such a dumb and ignorant insult 

Most people dont consider it an insult. Its actually the predominant school of econ. Bitcoiners might consider it an insult, but you are not a bitcoiner.

> Keynesian economics, and to try to pin that down as a giant school of thought rather than a few discrete ideas is disingenuous

This is like the central belief; monetary policy is right at its heart. 
What you are saying ""just because I dont eat any meat or animal products doesnt mean im vegetarian"".  

> scheme you will make money on

I do not recommend bitcoin as a way to get rich, nor do I expect it.

> And I have been following bitcoin since the price was in cents, its an interesting experiment but it has completely failed and its flaws and poor design has been exposed for what it is.

You have a strange definition of failure. 

> Worthless

There is actually a quite discrete value even at current trade values.
If you expect it to go down, perhaps you should open up a large short on the market. Cash in on that prediction.

>  And the broken window fallacy is so stupid

Sounding very keynesian here... refuting a tautology is bold.

> You realize there is a whole hell of a lot more to economics than Keynsians vs others, right?

Im referring to its specifically because to matches your thinking. Once again: not an insult, just a fact. Like it or not, you are a keynesian believer. Thats a fine thing to be, there are many of you.

"> knowing deflationary currency is a terrible idea isnt keynsianism

Erroneously believing that money should lose value constantly is absolutely keynesian. You now learned that you are a keynesian fool - at least wear the dunce hat with pride or learn enough to take if off.

> its great and the best place I have found for actual level headed discussion of bitcoin 

Why would you want level headed discussion of a ""terrible idea"" ? It is by design sound money - it cannot inflate and must deflate. If you hate that idea, then Im not sure exactly what you might want to discuss.

> and other cryptos on here.

Bitcoin is a crypto currency, alts are for the most part scams. We dont talk about them here much, mostly because they are pointless distractions.

> If they did something other than eat poop with it then it wouldnt hold at all 

It hold for repairing broken windows. It holds for digging a ditch then filling it back in again. It holds for moving a dollar from your left pocket to your right pocket. It hold for natural disasters. It holds for all forms of government spending. 

Its just a demonstration of one of the many flaws in keynesianism.

>Treasury inflation protected securities (TIPS) refer to a treasury security that is indexed to inflation in order to protect investors from the negative effects of inflation.

"What can you buy with BTC? How is it an excellent medium of exchange? As of this moment, what can you purchase with BTC? Do you know what medium of exchange is? 

Store of value? This cryptocurrency is so volatile. In my opinion, there are two options; one shows that BTC can be a great store of value and one shows that it is shit as a store of value.

1). If you can purchase many things with BTC and you do not need to convert them to USD, then it is a great store of value since it was built to be a deflationary coin (which is not really good for economy in general, but it is another story). Example: you have 1 BTC and it equals to 1 BTC. Today, you need to buy bread and it is 0.5 BTC, in 1 year it will cost 0.4 BTC. This is good. 

2). This case scenario is bad for BTC as a store of value, if you need to convert it to another currency to purchase something. 
Example: You have 1 BTC you bought for $10 yesterday and you need to convert it to USD today because you can't buy anything necessary for everyday life. Today, when you convert your BTC, it might be $2, or $10, or $50. In this case, it is not a good store of value, since this is merely a speculating. 

In general, if an asset is very volatile, it is not a good store of value. If you put your $10 under your pillow and then check it one day and you see you have only $2 left and then another day it is $50 dollars, then it means your pillow is not a good store of value. The same with BTC, as long as it ""attached"" to fiat money and the price keeps jumping from one extreme to another, then it is not a store of value. It is a mere speculation.

"The main problem here is that Venezuela as well as some other countries, is heavily dependant of oil. To a point that it has created the instability you see today. When the oil plunged in 2013, it was a catastrophic for their national finance. The Bolivar fall is mainly due to that, but also because in order to finance the country they had no other choice but to print money, which cause, of course, inflation.

As long as Venezuela doesn't solve it's dependency to oil, it will never get better. You could argue of course that they ""just"" have to get some austerity going. But the situation is so bad that doing so could cause some serious unrest (civil war).

"For fucks sake, it is time for you to define what Bitcoin is: currency or asset? The OP is comparing Bitcoin to Venezuelan Bolivars, which means he or she is defining it as a currency. In this case, Bitcoin is worthless as currency since it doesn't fully satisfy any of the prerequisites needed to be called a currency, which are medium of exchange, store of value, and a unit of account. If you think it is a currency, then comparing it to USD is a waste of your time. You might say shit about the system that supplies the USD, such as Federal Reserve, banks, etc., but comparing currency (BTC) against currency (USD) is completely retarded.

If you think BTC is an asset, then I would want to hear from you what makes it an asset and I will gladly take my words back. Give us some of your non-retarded ass logic.

"Why do people keep promoting this absurd and idiotic subreddit ?

Those people have been around for five years and all of a sudden Bitcoin price drops and people want to bash us nonstop.  

Those people don't just make fun of hodl and say we're silly.  That subreddit is dangerous. 

They actually believe from the bottom of their hearts that blockchain has zero viable usage in the world!  They actually believe this.  They don't understand the value of a trusted system with absent authority *(as if Bitcoin hasn't beyond proved this the last nine years)*

"Since you have internet and crypto capable mining video cards, I assume you can play video games like WoW.

Background info:

Gold farming is something that has occurred in every MMO, and WOW is no exception.  To fight RMT (real money trade), Blizzard created an economic system where WoW gold has a real money / USD equivalent, which fluctuates and has, over time, inflated.   (Feel free to google ""wow gold more valuable than venezuela"")

People pay Blizzard real money ($20 USD) to acquire a ""game token"" that let's them get an amount of in-game gold, which gets listed on the in-game auction house.  A different player buying this token with gold can redeem the token for 30 days of game time, which is normally priced at $15 USD a month (less if you subscribe to WoW for longer periods at a time).

The token prices vary server to server, and region to region.  Historically, NA has always had the best exchange rates, and you can see these at websites like http://wowtokenprices.com/

In terms of bots, they've always existed since WoW has existed.  Unfortunately, the first, last, and only time I've used a bot (that I didn't write myself) was in 2010.   Finding a working bot is going to have to be on your end.  From when I last used it, the subscription service costed like $10 month or something, don't remember.

Bots can do things from collect trade skill materials to killing mobs for loot.

A lot of the bots are undetectable because (I suspect) that they are written in Auto-It.  If you do decide to go this route, make sure you're not botting 24/7 as inhuman behavior makes it more likely to get caught.

In terms of selling gold for actual currency, as I understand, there are currency exchange sites (gold farmer sites) that will buy gold in bulk from private sellers.  This is not something I'm an expert on, and I would make sure that before you attempt to sell some, make sure you don't get scammed.  You would definitely need to research more here.

I have also heard, through in-game voice chat, of guild mates selling gold on the regular to a regular purchaser  This was a very skilled player who has been in top 100 guilds, so I have no reason to not believe him.

There are also ways to make gold outside of botting.  People play the in-game auction house.  There are in-game addons that can help with this, but this is another topic to delve into.

For skilled, high end players, you can ""carry"" other players traid and dungeon carries.  About a year ago when a token was worth 100-150k, on my server, we charged anywhere from 400k (rich suckers near the start of the expansion) to as low as 150k gold for a dungeon carry.  Divided by a team of 4, that was sometimes as much as 100k gold or even as low as 30k gold for 30 or 60 minutes to complete a dungeon.  

Right now, *carries probably don't earn much gold* if any at all, but at the start of new expansions (one is being released in august), there will be a lot of demand again.  Because there's a new expansion in August, it's very possible to make good amounts of gold due to overwhelming demand for trade skill materials at the start of expansions.  

Bad/casual players also pay skilled, high end guilds to have them carried through raid dungeons.  I'm not an expert on the pricing, as this varies server to server based on supply/demand as well as how late into the expansion it is.

As a last note, botting and cheating is extremely unfair to legit players, and while I don't want to encourage it, I also think your situation in your country is completely fucked and if this is a method of livelihood for you, I wish you the best of luck.

"Everything from houses to food, it's just more difficult to find an accepting party.. but they are out there. Done believe me? Google it. Many condominiums we're sold in Dubai for BTC.. 13 or so each if my memory serves me correctly.

If you really wanted. You could live your entire life from BTC, if you can convince your landlord (or just own your own place) to accept it as payment. The only thing I see being difficult if paying for utility services (electricity and hydro).

As for a store of value. It is. 
Arguably not a great one, as you said it has a volilitile nature, but you can still store your money in it. You can at any time (given an internet connection) buy BTC and sell your same BTC irrigardless of you gaining or losing money, it's still there. Doesn't matter if it's storing it well or not. It's still keeping it in place. 
It's like me buying sand. Shitloads of sand. Now I have and own all this sand. All I need is someone (luckily for Bitcoin there's a lot of people willing) to pay me back for my sand.
