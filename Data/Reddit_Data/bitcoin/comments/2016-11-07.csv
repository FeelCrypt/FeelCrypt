"Testis-determining factor (TDF), also known as sex-determining region Y (SRY) protein, is a DNA-binding protein (also known as gene-regulatory protein/transcription factor) encoded by the SRY gene that is responsible for the initiation of male sex determination in humans.[2] SRY is an intronless sex-determining gene on the Y chromosome in therians (placental mammals and marsupials);[3] mutations in this gene lead to a range of sex-related disorders with varying effects on an individual's phenotype and genotype.

"Everything about bitcoin is steeped in the culture of the cypherpunks of the 90s. Most of the early contributors were old school cypherpunks. Bitcoin itself fulfils one of the most important desired pieces of crypto the cypherpunks desired: digital cash. Satoshi himself cited papers by a bunch of cypherpunks. In fact it's fairly obvious that whoever Satoshi was, he was around in the glory days of the cypherpunk mailing list.

The venn diagram of cypherpunks and people who consider themselves ""crypto-anarchists"" is pretty much entirely intersection. To deny the link between bitcoin and the broad ideologies that fall under ""crypto-anarchism"" is absurd.

Claiming that capitalism and anarchism can't go-exist is equally ridiculous when Bitcoin basically embodies both those things. The Bitcoin-enabled online drug trade is raw anarcho-capitalism. If you don't believe me, then think it through. We have anarchistic money and anarchistic ways of communicating with no central control. This is used to facilitate business between capitalists (for example weed growers, they make money via their ownership of capital: the seeds, and growing infrastructure) without any government enforcement of contracts or dispute resolution. You don't think capitalism and anarchism can exist? Open your eyes.

I'd be a lot more skeptical that communal ownership and distribution can exist without centralised power. All anarcho-capitalism needs is a means to defend what's yours.";3;1;False;;d9pv6jk;Excuse me?;5bhru0;https://i.imgur.com/eXh8daN.jpg

"You're obsessed with wiki.   pubmed is better, but you gotta use it from a university library to get access to the full journal articles.

That said, I can explain a specific type of the intersex/transgender phenomenon.

During the brain's early development, the part that responds to sex hormones is laid down before the fetus produces much of anything.  Mom is supposed to figure out boy or girl, and if a boy, fire some T at the fetus to sensitize it a certain way so its compatible with normal male T levels.  This almost always works.   Almost.   Almost kinda sucks when you're the oops.    

By missing, you end up with a brain that's setup for female(default) levels and sensitivity to testosterone living in a body that produces 10 times as much.

All kinds of really gross and annoying mental health issues arise as a result, and they are all very, not fun, and not sympathetic.

But there's a simple, cheap, easy cure.  Works like a champ.   Turn off the T.  Add a little E to replace lost aromatase production so the bones don't fall apart and you don't get demntia, and you're golden.    ";0;1;False;Becky_rw;d9otps6;Excuse me?;5bhru0;https://i.imgur.com/eXh8daN.jpg

"Treating a dangerous disease with an inexpensive, effective, and quite safe (as medical treatments go) therapy, is neither drastic nor radical.  Some of my trans friends object to the use of the word disease or mental illness, but I tend to think its fine.   I have diabetes, high blood pressure, etc, standard geezer diseases, I take a pill or shot, they cause minimal disruption to my day to day function.    Same deal here.

Also not knowing is VERY common in psych medicine; patients react differently to different psych medications and no one has the faintest idea why; some current medications don't even bother to attempt to find out why they work, ""they just do... sometimes... maybe.""   

Plastic surgery of various types are performed all the time with little controversy, and most pay themselves.   I see no difference with grs or surgery to remove gyno.  User should pay in full.

I'm a free market kind of person, so I'm sympathetic to your point.  You are deluded though if you think cost would ever discourage the step that bothers you most, HRT, because it is extremely cheap, and really requires no additional medical contact than what you'd normally do.  Endo's get involved because its easy and profitable; but nurse practitioner can prescribe this junk by eyeball with no significant risk.  Even the T level check is essentially routine for someone complaining about screwed up response to T type things.

Now, I have really bad news though; if you'll pause to think for a sec; if the US goes to an NHS type system, it will be the left that puts it in place; and when they do, they'll likely cover the whole array of transgender care, so not only will you get the privilege of paying for a bunch of bottom surgeries, you'll get to do it under threat of the IRS taking everything you own.   lol.   don't worry, they'll take a bunch of my money too...   This step is probably inevitable; you won't be able to do a thing about it.

Happiness, hmmm, I dunno.  Unless someone creates a drug that can rebuild that inner chunk of brain that reacts to sex hormones, the only way close to happy I can get is with an anti-androgen.  If I use an anti-androgen, I absolutely MUST use a substantial amount of estrogen; and thus, you have HRT.  Happiness seems vague and distant though;  so I settle for being content and peaceful; truly comfortable is my long term objective.    And HRT grants me that path for the first time in my quite long life.
