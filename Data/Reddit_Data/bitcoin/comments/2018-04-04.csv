What is Bitcoin in a nutshell

Small wonder that Bitcoin emerged in 2008 just after Occupy Wall Street accused big banks of misusing borrowers’ money, duping clients, rigging the system, and charging boggling fees. Bitcoin pioneers wanted to put the seller in charge, eliminate the middleman, cancel interest fees, and make transactions transparent, to hack corruption and cut fees. They created a decentralized system, where you could control your funds and know what was going on.

Bitcoin has come far in a relatively short time. All over the world, companies, from REEDS Jewelers, a large jewelry chain in the US, to a private hospital in Warsaw, Poland, accept its currency. Billion dollar businesses such as Dell, Expedia, PayPal, and Microsoft do, too. Websites promote it, publications such as Bitcoin Magazine publish its news, forums discuss cryptocurrency and trade its coins. It has its application programming interface";0;0;False;Johans_wilgat;dwsvowm;Bitcoin Doesn't Give a Fuck.;7yaaz2;https://v.redd.it/ty2y74gawug01

If you invest it and wait, the only logical choice is to invest it forever.

"I linked your article to my friend who is actually qualified to talk about this topic, here's what he says (unedited):

>maybe my view is jaded but i think this is a load of shit  
like by itself its stupid but if you add more services then it can be somewhat effective.  
look at utahs population and ratio to homeless, compare to nyc its absurd. Independent housing is always available for the homeless, i would argue maybe 20% of all homeless at most does NOT have a drug addiction, and the longer they stay homeless the higher the chance is.
If they are hooked on drugs these independent houses will become drug dens. I know workers that do home visits to check on the people and the turn over rate and incident rate is ridiculously huge.  
The amount of support that needs to be put in place in NYC is not just support but more strict enforcement and the independent houses need to be under martial law to enforce the strict rules that nyc has but no one gives a shit about
ex  1 client was hospitalized bc she tried to make cup noodles in a cardboard box on the stove. after a 2 week stay she was discharged back to INDEPENDENT housing where she set fire and burned the apt. then got hospitalized again.  
There needs to be a giant paradigm shift, everything needs to change inorder to possibly be effective

more:

>also the staff in shelters need to be routinely changed. shelter staff are getting cash from client that are loan sharks, sell meds,, there is a doctor in downtown bk that pulls people off the streets to run their insurance, then get a prescription then sell it and split it with shelter staff and docotors. AND DHS POLICE

>plus 40k per client per year?
shit that must be just housing not including hospital visits, medication and insurance billings. ex the client that started the fire was hospitalized over 51 times in last 2 years";1;0;False;trrrrouble;dwrcjgu;Investing Tips from a Pro;8982l3;https://i.redd.it/un9mdgl9dlp01.jpg

"Having trouble finding that exact figure and can't recall where I first heard/saw it - maybe local radio - but it stuck.  The number isn't really that far fetched when you consider it includes the cost of police time, court time, ER visits, etc.   

Doing a quick search this morning there is more than ample evidence to show that it is cheaper to house them than ignore them.

Most articles I do find cite these two Rand studies: https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR1694.html and https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_briefs/RB10000.html

And I found this stating that its more like $40k so maybe I misremembered. http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/mar/12/shaun-donovan/hud-secretary-says-homeless-person-costs-taxpayers/

So, yeah, you're probably right - the $100k number is probably overstated.  However, the point remains valid - its cheaper to house them than leave them in their campsites.

Right now, if you follow the news, Orange County CA has recently forcibly emptied a large ""settlement"" and there is a lot of discussion about where to send them.  The judge making the calls seems determined to ""solve"" the homeless problem once and for all with an eye to becoming a model for the nation.

Because sometimes you need to buy things at that moment. If you need a car now, it makes sense to buy it now. Similarly for housing, food. Everything you buy for yourself is because you prefer having that thing now than having it later and having some extra money on top. With giving to charities (and given your original claim that it’s better to give more money later than less money now) that never happens, because you would always prefer to get more money to give to the charity later than giving them less now.;2;1;False;mariout;dwt2faw;Investing Tips from a Pro;8982l3;https://i.redd.it/un9mdgl9dlp01.jpg

"> He already said multiple times that in that case he would try to find ways to distribute the funds, but he also said that if he would recieve it as a shareholder, there would be mayor taxes involved. So that's the worse option than CR.      
      
I started yesterday thread with direct question to Mark in mtgox insolvency disscusion sub about his plans and he has some misguided look regarding tax.

If he recevie this surplus as a dividend, tax advance is 40% but later settled on his final personal income net tax (20.4%) what would get him big tax return. Beside, when trustee settle with all creditors, what he almost can do with recent btc/bcc sale and no need to further btc+ forks sale, or at least not all remaining btc, Mtgox and Tibanne are not longer in bancrupcy liquidation and can resume business with this capital without requesting paying to the shareholders as a dividend. What I try to say: Trustee or nobody can force any shareholder (Mark) to receive dividend. If they liquidate remaning btc (by court order) even there is suficient monies to settle all creditors, this remaining capital can stay at mtgox for whatever time shareholders decide (at mtgox held bank account). Also, Mark can make us unsecured creditors Tibanne shareholders, but hes not obligated.";1;0;False;alfabi;dwsf4sk;I'm Mark Karpelès, ex-CEO of bankrupt MtGox.

"That would mean what exactly? Would it be as simple as this in theory? (using arbitrary numbers, I don't feel like researching the exact numbers, and these are probably easier to use for example purposes anyway). 

Say you owed 400K bitcoin. You lost 100K bitcoin. 

So you only have 300K bitcoin to give. Instead of going into fiat and all that. You could give people 75% of their bitcoins (aka if you had 8 btc on exchange, you now get 6 back)? Would it be that easy? 

Honestly, that would be a super good solution, as then MtGox would basically have been a super strong forced HODL. Is it completely fair? probably not. But I don't think many would complain. You loose 25% (or whatever the exact % would be, after all costs etc) of BTC, but gain ~1000% on the asset worth. 

I understand your hands are tied, but would this be a possible outcome of civil rehabilitation? Or would it look like first, a part of the BTC needs to be sold to settle the people in FIAT, as that is the law, then the remaining BTC could be divided in a way as described above?

"It's an alternative to bankruptcy. Bankruptcy would lead to the liquidation of MtGox's assets. The creditors would receive $483 per bitcoin and 100% of the cash they had at MtGox. The surplus (~160,000 BTC and BCH, plus ~200,000 BTG) would be converted into JPY and given to MtGox's shareholders (Mark Karpelès and Jed McCaleb) and the Japanese government would get a large portion of that money in taxes.

If the court accepts to switch from bankruptcy to civil rehabilitation, the remaining bitcoins and the forks could potentially be distributed to the creditors instead of being sold for JPY and given to the shareholders.

We could hope to receive around 1/5th of a bitcoin for each bitcoin we owned, which is substantially better than $483. Plus, converting the bitcoins and the forks into JPY would be catastrophic for the BTC, BCH and BTG markets. This would probably also affect other cryptocurrencies that have nothing to do with bitcoin.

Mark stated that he doesn't want the money and that he supports civil rehabilitation, which is fantastic. Most creditors do too in all likelihood. The court will only entertain civil rehabilitation if the plan makes sense and is in everyone's interest.";8;1;False;Exotemporal;dwsl3hk;I'm Mark Karpelès, ex-CEO of bankrupt MtGox.

"Thank you for your reply.

I hope that your trial and Vinnik's trial in the US will allow everyone to get a crystal clear picture of how everything happened exactly. WizSec's presentation was great, but so many questions remain.

For what it's worth, I hold no grudge against you anymore and your behavior recently has been exemplary. I sincerely hope that the time you served in jail already will cover your possible sentence. When I put myself in your shoes, I don't think that I could have coped with the extraordinary amount of pressure and doubt you've had to live with for so long. I'd probably be a depressed recluse or a fugitive.

The consequences of your oversights and poor decisions were mind-bogglingly huge, but in my opinion, you've paid enough for those oversights and poor decisions already. These actions or lack of actions should be looked at in vacuum, not through the lens of the suffering that resulted in part from them.

I didn't dispute the rejection because it wasn't a significant amount of money, because the procedure seemed complex, because I didn't have much evidence and because I always viewed this transfer at the 11th hour as a gamble that didn't pan out.

I only mentioned it because I was really surprised that the trustee didn't work with a database that included these deposits. I can understand why the deposit might not have been added to my account automatically with the site down, but I would've expected the trustee to do it or to freeze the bank account and have all deposits sent back.

I wish you the best of luck and sincerely hope that you'll be able to live in peace after the trial and the potential lawsuits that might follow.

"> Uh, that's CCN not CNN.

Cheerfully edited.

>And even at that, it's the embezzlement of 20 million Yen that is at issue, not necessarily what it was spent on.

To quote the first paragraph of the article:

""The head of collapsed Bitcoin exchange MtGox was facing fresh embezzlement charges Wednesday, as Japanese media said some of the allegedly stolen funds were spent on prostitutes.""

The trustee of tibanne has recently made a new claim of ~$200m against the trustee of mtgox, AFAIK without much mention of what the money was spent on. Given there was very little actual property sold off at the beginning apart from a few small things, It's a fair bet there was a disgustingly large amount of customer money spent on hookers.

He delayed the forming of a real creditor group by acting as the de facto leader of the bankruptcy community through the mtgoxinsolvency subreddit and offering legal counsel that was woefully incomplete and has resulted in the outcome that legally he will receive most of what's left over.

> Who's your celebrity crush?

I don't think I ever had much interest for celebrities.

> In basic units, what are the general personality types of employees you've observed? What did you look for in hiring someone?

Each employee is quite unique and it'd be difficult to group people in ""basic units"". The most important trait I will look for is motivation, followed by adaptability and skills.

People with no motivation will not produce good work, even if they have the right skills. On the other hand people may learn if they have the right motivation.

"That is clearly not what he said. In that circumstance, ""distributing it would still end in more costs"" not necessarily affects his willingness to distribute (in that case, at least).

Notice though that his willingness to distribute may be quite irrelevant, though, because he is personally bankrupt. Depending on how much money ended up in his hands in the end, he might not be able to give back anything even if he wanted.

So, if through civil rehabilitation we can get, let us say, 80% back of the 160k BTC, through suing him (e.g., for criminal responsibility in the hacked coins) we might get 30% or less.

Additionally, Karpeles is not the only shareholder. 12% is owned by Jed Mccaleb and his claim was bought by Brock Pierce. He paid for buying that claim, so he will not easily give up his share (and let us hope that helps to back the tethers!).

Have you ever started/ ran a business that got fucked over by outside forces, and was forced into bankruptcy, and been in way over your head? I have. Saving the business consumes 100% of your life. Unfortunately, like in this case, your best efforts are nowhere near enough to fix it. The lack of communication from the top makes it look like they are intentionally hiding information, and some may be, but many times it is just being blinded by fear, rage, exhaustion, or any other all consuming situation. I am not giving this guy a pass. He fucked up, and he's making an attempt to fix it, or at least mitigate the damages, and reduce the likelihood that it happens to anyone else. ;4;1;False;luv_to_race;dwt30ic;I'm Mark Karpelès, ex-CEO of bankrupt MtGox.

"> You know, if he was seeking attention for himself, we'd be hearing about him much more often than we do. I think the point of this post is actually the opposite. He wants less attention (and is willing to take temporarily elevated attention to achieve that).

Every time his relevance starts to fade he comes up with a new way to put himself in the spotlight.

He has spouted the same rhetoric for years but still has failed to answer even the most basic questions about what actually happened. You could check this for yourself but he deleted all of his posts some time ago. 

Note that he won't answer any of the creditors poignant questions relating to what actually happened but he will answer questions about his underwear.

At this point in time it's safe to say that yes he does just love the attention and this AMA serves nothing other than his own colossal ego and delusions of grandeur. 

>So, while you might have a point in criticizing his spending, it's pretty likely things would have failed even more spectacularly if he had tried to use all his time for the stressful work. You're basically saying that he should not have had any free time at all.

You're putting words in my mouth. 

If you believe the story he has told, Mark didn't even have a basic system in place to reconcile account balances with btc wallets. 

But of course this can't be confirmed because the ""records"" have been somehow destroyed or manipulated. 

I'm not saying that he shouldn't have had any free time at all. 

What I'm just saying that maybe he could have spent **a few moments** using his wonderful coding skills or spent **a couple of measly dollars** of the at least **$200m** of our money that he spent on god knows what during the **several years** he spent running the exchange, to come up with a basic accounting system so that the thefts couldn't have gone on for so long or for such a large amount of money. 

He claims he couldn't find the time to do this very basic, obvious thing. He could however find time to go gallivanting around with hookers and buying expensive machines for his failed cafe. 

>Also, it's quite clear in hindsight whose money he was using. However, it's rather likely he didn't realize it at the time and thought it was his money to use.

It's rather more likely that he knew exactly whose money he was using for a long time considering the emails indicating he was well aware he was in the red since the very beginning.

"The second one.  

If Bitfinex/Tether ""prints"" another 100 million worth of USDT onto it's chain, then mixes the coins to hide origination and anonymize the transaction chain, then buys bitcoin with it (or has a third party/intermediary entity do it), then uses the purchased bitcoin to help keep tether pegged at $1 USD valuation in the midst of ongoing volatility and swings, isn't that just outright fraud? In the realm of little to no regulation of crypto, can you truly, accurately detect this happening?  I don't think there is an effective framework to prevent or detect, the entity mixing the coins would have to slip up, but if there were no slip ups, you could inject unlimited valuation into cryptocurrency on the back of tether that's pegged to a price but not backed up with legitimate fiat despite that being the expectation.";3;1;False;dezmd;dwshf78;I'm Mark Karpelès, ex-CEO of bankrupt MtGox.

"I'm no Japanese attorney, but in the US, this concept is known as Quantum Meruit - and it's an action in contract law. 

I'm not sure how it would apply in the context of a bankruptcy proceeding in which all contracts are voidable by the trustee.  

In US, a court in equity could find under the doctrine of unclean hands that a defendant cannot enrich himself through various bad acts that have caused the loss to others, even if within technical rights under the law.  would have to find that there was ""bad faith"" - but I would expect that there is ample evidence of that here.  

The plaintiffs possibly could sue (under US law) for specific performance - they could ask for the bitcoin back instead of the value in yen of the bitcoin at the time of the bankruptcy petition.  No one would be made whole, but the shareholders wouldn't make out like bandits.

ToS suggested that bitcoins deposited there could be considered as held in custody. However, bitcoins are fungible and they where held all together in a same wallet system (even together with Gox's own BTC denominated profits).

"You know, if he was seeking attention for himself, we'd be hearing about him much more often than we do. I think the point of this post is actually the opposite. He wants *less attention* (and is willing to take temporarily elevated attention to achieve that).

Also, I'd like to point out that the human mind requires time to wind off to retain the ability to do stressful productive work. It's impossible to use 100% of your time doing stressful stuff effectively.

So, while you might have a point in criticizing his spending, it's pretty likely things would have failed even more spectacularly if he had tried to use all his time for the stressful work. You're basically saying that he should not have had any free time at all.

Also, it's quite clear in hindsight whose money he was using. However, it's rather likely he didn't realize it at the time and thought it was his money to use. 

That being said, I do consider it to be criminally negligent to run an exchange without actually auditing periodically that you actually have the customer funds you're supposed to have. (So I actually agree that he was acting very irresponsibly, I just disagree with your reasoning for why)

That. I did not really read something new. The real questions still waiting for answers were not answered:

- was he running the Willy & Markus bots? If yes, why?

- how could a big part of his Fiat balance disappear?

- why didn't he at least install a monitoring system for cold and hot wallets and all other balances?

- were some VIPs paid out prior to the closure?

- why did he tell us just days before the  shutdown that everything was ok?

- what made him buy a goddam office chair for tens of thousands of dollars with his clients money? Especially when he had those blue gymnastics balls to sit on?

"I started yesterday thread with direct question to Mark in mtgox insolvency disscusion sub about his plans and he has some misguided look regarding tax.

If he recevie this surplus as a dividend, tax advance is 40% but later settled on his final personal anual net income tax (20.4%) what would get him big tax return. Beside, when trustee settle with all creditors, what he almost can do with recent btc/bcc sale and no need to further btc+ forks sale, or at least not all remaining btc, Mtgox and Tibanne are not longer in bancrupcy liquidation and can resume business with this capital without requesting paying to the shareholders as a dividend. If trustee or court decide current claims is all we get - its over for us. This remaining btc+forks liquidated or not stays as mtgox assets and then bancrupcy proceeding can still get switched to the CR, just without liabilities to us - unsecured mtgox creditors, we would be regarded as settled. Beside, Trustee or nobody can force any shareholder (Mark) to receive dividend. If they liquidate remaning btc (by court order) even there is suficient monies to settle all creditors, this remaining capital can stay at mtgox for whatever time shareholders decide (at mtgox held bank account). Also, Mark can make us, unsecured creditors as Tibanne shareholders where Tibanne own 88% Mtgox, but hes not obligated.      
       
Hear this analogy: person is held as custodian other people gold. Around 3/4 of this gold get stolen and person declare bancrupcy although he is not actually bankrupt because no gold of his own got stolen. Trustee use little bit of gold to settle and pay all persons liabilities and debts (house bills, bank credit, food,expense,gas, anything what he owes etc). Meanwhile, gold price goes to the roof, trustee sell enough or even whole gold and settle all bankrupt person debts and liabilities, including people who gave him gold at his custody,but with price rate of 10% today prices and pays the rest of the sold gold to the person bank account and bankrupt person is not bankrupt anymore. Why, because, he assumed gold as his ownership and make entry as such in accounting books so gold he got from other people is regarded as his own asset/belonging, not just as custody!
This is similar what Mark did, just instead of person is an corporation/company, but he blames bankrupcy laws as unjust, no, its his fuck up!      
       
If you as a person are bancrupt and you are, why your 100% shares in Tibanne are not liquidated? How long can personal (not corporation) bancrupcy proceedings in Japan take, is there a time limit? As Iam aware, straight bancrupcy liquidation takes 2-3 months. Civil Rehab for individual insolvency can usualy take 6 months until acceptence of appropriate plan where you can pay installment payment up to 3 years, if no payment court can gruant a discharge under special circustaments. And there is special conciliation what can take up two months. What are yours proceeding?

Btw, why Tibanne is bankrupt? Why Mtgox 88% shares what Tibanne have are not liquidated (sold to the best bider)?";2;0;False;alfabi;dwsfmq8;I'm Mark Karpelès, ex-CEO of bankrupt MtGox.

Your entire post is an exercise in hypocrisy. How are you this retarded? Dude I insult people that deserve it but at least I'm totally open about it instead of pretending that I'm not insulting people when I really am. You've dropped so far man. It really was not that hard to bait you into slipping from your feigned moral highground. 

At least I had some reason why I called him a russian propagandist; he's literally defending russia with tactics so closely associated with russian propagandists that theres a whole wikipedia page about it. 

On the other hand, you've pulled some random jewish conspiracy theory out of nowhere! For no reason other than bigotry. Not that I expected anything else from anyone that posts on r/The_Puppet.

Even if people can claim many people weren’t able to do so, and they’ll still sit on a loss. Easiest way would be to make a diff of claims and balances and refund those that missed the claim at least in half, the remeinaing btc distribute to everybody fair share 
If this won’t happen you’re a real fraustar and most likely end up being shot. I think you’re smart enough knowing if you get rich out of this dilemma you’re a dead men and somebody will eventually do it.

"Wow, I guess yesterday thread I made with direct question to the Mark influanced him to make this AMA. Regardless, thanks Mark, and check tax laws better, will you? Advance tax on the tax event (or payment) is not final tax for either corporation or person what is settled annualy. Example: advance tax for dividend payment might be 40%, while final tax on net anual income is 20,42% what would obviusly make big tax return!       
If you as a person are bancrupt and you are, why your 100% shares in Tibanne are not liquidated? How long can personal (not corporation) bancrupcy proceedings in Japan take, is there a time limit? As Iam aware, straight bancrupcy liquidation takes 2-3 months. Civil Rehab for individual insolvency can usualy take 6 months until acceptence of appropriate plan where you can pay installment payment up to 3 years, if no payment court can gruant a discharge under special circustaments. And there is special conciliation what can take up two months. What are yours proceeding?
        
Btw, why Tibanne is bankrupt? Why Mtgox 88% shares what Tibanne have are not liquidated (sold to the best bider)?
What that 200M$ debt? Any surplus if remaining btc are liqidated/or not, under mtgox bancrupcy liquidation goes to the MtGox capital. Its questionable can this surplus regarded as a capital gain due reasons I start to explain in another thread, but it will be regarded as capital gain if its sent (transfered) from Mtgox to the Tibanne so you can collect your dividend share, if requested.(Can mtgox pay dividend to you direct out of their asset, Iam not sure as this is japan tax/corporate laws, but doubt - payee can only be Tibanne.) You as 100% Tibanne owner and Tibanne owns 88% share in Mtgox can get dividend only if its paid first to the Tibanne and enter reserved dividend from anualy taxed net corporation income/profit and then to you, what you (actually Tibanne for you) pay first 40% advance tax, but afterwards you get big tax return after anaual net tax 20.42% is been settled. Dividend is not paid direct by trustee under bancrupcy liquidation, nobody can force you to receive dividends, not even in CR (company in CR can make profit and dividend to the shareholder, its just supervision), surplus regardless of CR or normal business can remain at Mtgox capital!  You made mess with this corporation setting (Tibanne-Mtgox) from the get-go and assumed account btc/fiat holding as corporation/company assets what were not, not ever booked as such. Who even evaluated Tibanne and Mtgox as bankrupt? They were not actually bankrupt, btc/fiat holdings was not their asset/capital nor capital equity, nor liability because you could not use this funds in the business (example, credit or loan can be liability and used in business and btc/fiat was not liability as company can't use it), Mtgox was just custodian of these btc/fiat holdings! Did mtgox or tibanne paid tax based on these btc/fiat deposit?  Of course not, these deposit was not mtgox income or capital gain!!!(as oposed company profit/income from fees or from mtgox own asset or investments), so why would either you as an shareholder or corporation pay tax for capital gain or dividends payout when that wasn't mtgox/Tibanne capital/asset or liability to begin with!?? That btc/fiat was only in Mtgox custody (as a bank), not as your property/capital equity/asset. No company or person can make profit with custodian funds as they can't use them as they own - its not credit or loan or borrow! With liability (credit,loan) they can make income! Big difference and all is big mess from the getgo!  You were responsible for accounting and still can be hold liable for wrong doing and wrong bancrupcy assesment! With such accounting and corporation register, our deposits are shared and responsible for all corporation liabilities and debts as they are regarded as compajy capital asset, not funds under custody and we are forced the same as we loaned MtGox this funds, and its unsecured loan without share in company profit otherwise it would be different. In my opinion, you Mark should never declare bancrupcy as such company register and accounting, but distribute remaining 200k btc + fiat in 2014.

"Mark,

As a creditor - this is at least reassuring that you say you will not be taking possession of the remaining bitcoins as a windfall. This loss of funds has already been devastating - and now consumed 4 years of my life. I, nor you, can change what happened in the past, but the very least that should happen is that the creditors should get the entire value of the appreciation of their original funds.

Make that part at least happen so that we get back 20% or whatever of our original funds, and I assume sometime around the year 2030.

When this is over, just fade away please and stay out of the limelight. I do not want to have anything against you personally - but everytime I see you in the news I get a swell of anger. The amount of damage you caused in our lives is enough - make it stop at some point.

"Hi Mark,

First off I'm glad you survived all the personal attacks and managed to stay sane and relatively active on reddit and IRC despite all the memes and hatred.

I have had a few questions on my mind for years some of which you may be able to answer here.

1. Who wrote/managed the ""Willy bot"" & what was it's intended purpose? 
2. Pior to the closing of withdraws at Mt Gox at what point were you aware that the BTC had gone missing? 
3. Chain analysis seems to show that the hacker/hackers were stealing coins for years prior to the final bankruptcy. 
Are you aware of any reason why they simply didn't empty the wallets completely? 
4. Are there other company shareholders who also have claim to this extra BTC? Do they share your opinon that it is the creditors who deserve it?

Despite what people may think Mt Gox helped build and shape this community. It showed people bitcoin had real value when it was just some cool tech. We learnt from Gox and the community is stronger because of it.

"Well Mark, I guess your PGP message is proof enough for me.
  
I want to thank you.
  
Probably not something you hear a lot these days.  But back in the days before Gox went belly up, I was a plebe who had decided to look into bitcoins.  I had heard about them for a while but never had any money to invest.  
  
I had gotten a career level job then and decided to jump in.  Naturally I wanted the most trusted and stable place to put my first investment.  I chose Mt. Gox because, well because it was the obvious choice.
  
So I sent out all the information requested and waited.  Two weeks went by and I heard nothing.  I got some hardware fob in the mail that would give me access to my account, but no account had yet been set up.
  
I contact Tech Support who told me that things had been really backed up there and they'd get back to making my account in a week or so.  That sounded really odd to me.  But I waited anyway.
  
At the end of that week, I had still heard nothing.  So I reached out again.  I got an apology and pretty much the same answer.  At this point I decided maybe Gox was not the best place for my money and went elsewhere.  Honestly I don't even know where it was but the coins I bought eventually ended up safe on the Trezor that sits on my desk today.
  
A few days after I made my first purchase at the Gox alternative, I saw the news about the coins lock down.  Then it went belly up.  Then people we camping out in Japan with big signs.  But my coins were safe in my other account.
  
Had it not been for the immense incompetence of your staff at creating new accounts, I would have given Gox my very first coin purchase.  And would have almost immediately lost it all for good.  And then I most certainly would have been so soured at the experience that I would never have had anything to do with crypto again.
  
So again I want to thank you and your staff for fucking up my new account create request and bullshitting me about it to the point where I no longer trusted Mt. Gox.  I also learned almost firsthand why you never ever keep your coins on an exchange and always be in direct control of your keys.
  
Thanks.  A lot.  Seriously.  I actually told myself that if I ever had the chance to talk to you, this is what I'd say.  So I guess a bucket list item has been checked off as well.

"Mark, 

I've been following the bankruptcy process fairly closely. It seems the CoinLab case will be the biggest barrier in receiving any payments in the near-term. Is there not an argument for the trustee to sell enough bitcoin to pay the case in full - similar to what he did when he locked in full payment a month ago - to settle the suit? 

While bitcoin creditors would lose out on a reasonably large chunk of what they would receive in civil rehabilitation, it would enable fiat creditors to be paid in full, soon. Also it would speed up the distribution (probably by several years) for those holding in bitcoin.  ";10;1;False;damskii;dwsai9y;I'm Mark Karpelès, ex-CEO of bankrupt MtGox.

Hi Mark,  

At some point the Trustee will need to confer/consult with the creditors en-masse. He could do this directly using original contact info or he could reach out to a group like MtGoxLegal. It might be easier to go the MtGoxLegal group if it isn't an official vote. 

Would you be willing to help grow MtGoxLegal by sending out an email with a link? You mentioned you might be willing to do this in the past. 

If you have conditions what would they be? 

If you won't send out an email to help organise the creditors what are your reasons?

Hi. You said in your AMA that you don't want a billion dollars. Can I have twenty million dollars in Bitcoin to retire and invest? I'll settle for 5 million..

I have a crippling form of schizophrenia and major clinical depression. Getting up every morning is a struggle and it's hard to live. I'm obese, my hair is falling out, I'm on Medicaid, I have erectile dysfunction as well. I'm 24 years old.

Can you please help me? If I had twenty million dollars I would invest 4 million in 3.5% return dividend stocks, put a few million in $200,000 checking accounts, invest $5 million in Google and save the rest. With that money I could buy a house, retire, live my life without working and manage my schizophrenia. I can provide proof that I have schizophrenia if you want it.

I have $40,000 in student loan debt and $1500 in credit card debt. Please help me Mark Karpeles. 

If my investment in Google turns out to be successful, I can pay you back in twenty five years after the value of the stock goes up.

"Hear this analogy: person is held as custodian other people gold. Around 3/4 of this gold get stolen and person declare bancrupcy although he is not actually bankrupt because no gold of his own got stolen. Appointed person bankrupcy trustee/supervisor use little bit of gold or sell furniture to settle and pay some persons liabilities and debts including his trustee expenses. After some 4 years, gold price goes to the roof, trustee sell enough or even whole gold and settle all bankrupt person debts and liabilities, including people who gave him a gold under his care or custody, but exchanged to old evaluated rate of 10% today gold prices and pays the rest of the sold gold to the person bank account and bankrupt person is not bankrupt anymore. Why, because, he assumed gold as his ownership and make entry as such in accounting books so gold he got from other people is regarded as his own asset/belonging, not just as custody! That gold can't be regarded as person liability such as credit or loan are either. Credit/loan/investment can be used to make a profit or share in profit trough dividend, custody funds can't! Its special liability not involved in person asset/capital balance sheet.      
This is similar what Mark did, just instead of person is an corporation/company, but he blames bankrupcy laws as unjust, no, its his fuck up from the getgo!

1. We didn't have an exact estimate, but following Ulbricht's arrest and shut down of silk road we noticed a drop in activity which allowed put a figure on that at around 20%~30%
2. I received a lot of media attention. I am pretty sure I'm not DPR, but explaining that to people and convincing them is more tricky. There was however no legal repercussions for being named by Ross' attorny since by that time US law enforcement had enough evidence I wasn't linked.  I never talked with Ross but I did exchange a few emails with his mother.

I've discussed with many creditors and so far I do not think any majority of creditors wants for the CoinLab case to be settled in full. While the lawsuit is still in progress and blocking the whole bankruptcy, it is clearly meritless and paying CoinLab even a cent would justify their current action which is, as I see it, taking the whole bankruptcy and its ~24750 creditors hostage until payment is made.;16;2;False;MagicalTux;dwscgo3;I'm Mark Karpelès, ex-CEO of bankrupt MtGox.

"1. Multiple reasons for that, from the security concept of cold wallets to others I cannot comment on yet.
2. Only a limited numbers of employees, our lawyers, the court, and the soon-to-be-trustee.
3. No idea, this document wasn't made by me, but I'd guess it was an estimate on how much would be needed to keep MtGox alive.
4. Missing 95k BTC doesn't equal being insolvent. That's actually a rather complex issue currently being discussed in court, so I can't enter into the details at this point.
5. I've been doing a lot of things to keep the company alive. I didn't spend as much time as rumored on the café, I guess what you call ""fancy door locks"" is the security system used in the 2012 office and wasn't especially time consuming either, and as to creating yubikeys I had to create the process, so of course I'd spend time on this in 2011 or early 2012.

"Mark,

Thanks for posting. This shows courage. If you do get control of that massive pool of BTC might I suggest two thing. 

1. Commit to not selling them all at once and a planned method of sale, say 1% annually, this will help the community fears.
2. Plan to use them for the betterment of Bitcoin. Use the 1% annually to reward new development and promotion activity that meaningfully strengthens BTC. 
- This could be done through a charitable trust, which you administer. 
- I would suggest a support limit if $100K annually, US Dollars, for any particular person or developer so that these proceeds are throughly spread. Perhaps $1M annually for an organization.

"Hi,

1. I'm sorry but I cannot respond to that at this point due to ongoing legal proceedings.
2. At the time withdrawals in BTC were closed only transaction malleability was known, and stopping withdrawals was a way to stop this from being abused as we couldn't track transfers which IDs were changed. While over 1000 BTC were stolen that way, it wasn't expected any large amount of BTC were missing until later investigation in MtGox assets, which then prompted filing for civil rehabilitation.
3. Chances are the hacker couldn't transfer more, which resulted in avoiding detection.
4. The only other shareholder would be Jed McCaleb, but I do not think he wants (nor needs to) claim anything.

At Mt. Gox Legal, we've been following this case very closely, and concluded that there was no real chance of Mark or Jed getting to keep the surplus, in part due to Japan's laws regarding unjust enrichment:

Yes, we're at the mercy of the court. Having Mark push for civil rehabilitation certainly helps though since the court's main motivation is to avoid making a decision that would put a party in a worse situation than if they went with a bankruptcy. In a civil rehabilitation, Mark and the other investor are the only people losing some money.

"Bankruptcy: Liquidate everything, pay fiat to creditors, outstanding assets(ie btc etc) go to shareholders i.e. Mark and Jeb.

CR: Reinstate the company and pay out assets pro rata to the creditors meaning that unlike bankruptcy you aren't limited to the fiat valuation given at the time of bankruptcy. 

Technically, you could have another exchange take over and reboot the exchange though CR...but there seems to be no appetite to do so.

It's also worth noting that this is potentially the first bankruptcy in history where fiat creditors get their full claim and those claiming btc will get back more in fiat value than their claim was worth at the time of bankruptcy. Fiat wise I'm getting over three times more back than my original claim...but no need to point out this is cold comfort when I'm only getting 23% of my btc back.";6;0;False;TheFreemanLIVES;dwt4s92;I'm Mark Karpelès, ex-CEO of bankrupt MtGox.

"Ah ok. Does that really make a big difference though? 

Probably very unfeasible as well though, with the legal stuff afaik.

The value of Bitcoin in USD changes rapidly while the value of cash only raises and lowers with deflation and inflation respectively. It's really more like an investment firm stealing all the investors' stock in a very successful company than to settle the dispute, they decide to just give you the cash value of the stock at any given time, instead of giving you your shares. This isn't really an issue because you can just go buy Bitcoin again at (hopefully) around the same price. Problem is, do they keep the Bitcoins and pay back in cash that they already have presently? Or do they sell the Bitcoins and give you the cash as a result of the sale? ;0;0;False;gaytheistfedora;dwshhey;I'm Mark Karpelès, ex-CEO of bankrupt MtGox.

"Just chiming in that traditionally, when you had an author or celebrity that either had Q&A sessions or interviews, they were topical and somewhat focused. They were about the book just written, or about the movie just opening, or about the anniversary of some event being covered. Questions that were irrelevant or unrelated to that topic were avoided or dismissed.

AMAs became an alternative approach in which there wasn't a specific topic or focus and instead open to any topic that may come up, from current projects, to future plans, to past work, to personal stories/lives/preferences. Obviously, as others pointed out, this doesn't obligate them to answer *any* question (""What's your bank account and password?"") but the AMA format is just a more open forum in which a much wider variety of questions are considered acceptable and may receive an answer instead of instantly dismissed as off-topic.";5;1;False;tocano;dwsyerj;I'm Mark Karpelès, ex-CEO of bankrupt MtGox.

I had no intention to buy anything at the time, I just wanted to have it. After I lost those Bitcoins, I swore to never touch them again. 

I still like the idea of Bitcoins, but have a strong distrust in the community due to MtGox. The bitterness is further accentuated by the current value of what those Bitcoins I had would be.

>After reading the dailymail version, it does sound like a legitimate assertion, but the way you present it just feels like a smear attempt instead of an issue that actually matters to people that got fucked over. 

I literally said one line about it and you made a huge issue about it. I was pointing out the contradiction in his bogus claim about not being able to find time to do things that needed to be done. 

We are talking about a man whose modus operandi is to tell massive lies, then delete his posts, then come and revise history when people have forgotten exactly what was said or given up caring. 

I don't think you understand the true character of this man. He said he was quitting reddit at one stage for crying out loud. It was a matter of hours after he had finally left that we formed a (semi) unified legal movement.

A smear attempt? This man has had direct involvement in literally the greatest heist in history and has so far escaped without any semblance of real consequence and barely a whisper in the media.

As a person whose suffered at his hands to the tune of millions, I'd say his character deserves far more smear than what he's received. 
I would really like to know where all that money went because it certainly wasn't spent on anything tangible, least of all a decent security or accounting setup for mtgox.

He told us he had the coins in cold storage, with the private keys stored in such a way as to make it impossible for them to be stolen or confiscated.

With his discourse he likes to paint a picture of himself as a man of moral fiber doing his ""best"" to try and recover customer funds, but this basically couldn't be further from the truth. 

He has employed (seemingly) deliberate attempts at stalling active creditor response on numerous occasions and has displayed near constant veiled contempt towards us. 

If you look at the outcome with the ""surplus"" funds going into his hands, it's pretty obvious why he was stalling us until after the deadline for filing objections to the claims process had passed.

He has antagonized many different creditors on many, many occasions. He even made a statement to the effect that he felt somehow entitled to the ""surplus"" funds right before he ""left"" reddit. Of course I can't verify this statement because he deleted his entire post history.

I don't think you understand how truly sick he is, I don't know why you're trying to defend him. About his decision to spend customer funds on prostitutes no less.

"Expose me? Video deleted? There’s nothing to expose and I most certainly did not have any video’s deleted :)

The story is a little bit more complicated than that. Mark always used the excuse of banking problems. He implicitely promised me I would be able to sell my 5 mil worth of btc and get my money. After I sent them to him and converted into USD, it was suddenly no longer possible. My lawyer told me to freeze his bank accounts, but I said no cause I didn’t want to bring Mtgox down (I know it would have). This is all provable with emails. So I actually put the community above my own (5 mil) interest at that point, because 1 week later mtgox went belly up anyway and if I would have filed my claim and frozen his accounts the week before that, I would have been before any other creditor and would have recovered my 5 mil much easier. After that I converted back to btc and exited at 20% of original value through bitcoinbuilder. And yes, I originally claimed the difference between those amounts cause I felt Mark was responsible for making false promises and luring me in, but later I realized that this money would come from other creditors so I didnt press my claim after it was rejected. I still fully intend to sue Mark personally to recover my money, but at least it won’t be coming from anyone else.

"I don't think you understand this situation. Mt Gox had been insolvent for several months, and lied to its users about this the entire time.  They decided to literally gamble that the price of bitcoin would stay low enough for them to buy back the lost coins, despite the massive upward pressure this would obviously create; they lost horribly. This is not a responsible way to save your company from bankruptcy. He should have shut down deposits and withdrawals as soon as he realized there were funds lost in order to minimize the number of users effected. MtGox experienced tremendous growth throughout the time period in which they were insolvent, and as a result ultimately hurt more individuals than if they had been transparent and responsible about fixing their insolvency.

So.... is Craigslist responsible for whatever people sell in its classified section? Not only are they not, but there are specific laws exempting websites from liability for what their users do.
