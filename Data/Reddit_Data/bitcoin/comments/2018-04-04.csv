What is Bitcoin in a nutshell

Small wonder that Bitcoin emerged in 2008 just after Occupy Wall Street accused big banks of misusing borrowers’ money, duping clients, rigging the system, and charging boggling fees. Bitcoin pioneers wanted to put the seller in charge, eliminate the middleman, cancel interest fees, and make transactions transparent, to hack corruption and cut fees. They created a decentralized system, where you could control your funds and know what was going on.

Bitcoin has come far in a relatively short time. All over the world, companies, from REEDS Jewelers, a large jewelry chain in the US, to a private hospital in Warsaw, Poland, accept its currency. Billion dollar businesses such as Dell, Expedia, PayPal, and Microsoft do, too. Websites promote it, publications such as Bitcoin Magazine publish its news, forums discuss cryptocurrency and trade its coins. It has its application programming interface";0;0;False;Johans_wilgat;dwsvowm;Bitcoin Doesn't Give a Fuck.;7yaaz2;https://v.redd.it/ty2y74gawug01

No need to get personal. The point is to show that if you value giving money to charity, the only time you can do it without being illogical is now. If you invest it and wait, the only logical choice is to invest it forever.

"I linked your article to my friend who is actually qualified to talk about this topic, here's what he says (unedited):

>maybe my view is jaded but i think this is a load of shit  
like by itself its stupid but if you add more services then it can be somewhat effective.  
look at utahs population and ratio to homeless, compare to nyc its absurd. Independent housing is always available for the homeless, i would argue maybe 20% of all homeless at most does NOT have a drug addiction, and the longer they stay homeless the higher the chance is.
If they are hooked on drugs these independent houses will become drug dens. I know workers that do home visits to check on the people and the turn over rate and incident rate is ridiculously huge.  
The amount of support that needs to be put in place in NYC is not just support but more strict enforcement and the independent houses need to be under martial law to enforce the strict rules that nyc has but no one gives a shit about
ex  1 client was hospitalized bc she tried to make cup noodles in a cardboard box on the stove. after a 2 week stay she was discharged back to INDEPENDENT housing where she set fire and burned the apt. then got hospitalized again.  
There needs to be a giant paradigm shift, everything needs to change inorder to possibly be effective

more:

>also the staff in shelters need to be routinely changed. shelter staff are getting cash from client that are loan sharks, sell meds,, there is a doctor in downtown bk that pulls people off the streets to run their insurance, then get a prescription then sell it and split it with shelter staff and docotors. AND DHS POLICE

>plus 40k per client per year?
shit that must be just housing not including hospital visits, medication and insurance billings. ex the client that started the fire was hospitalized over 51 times in last 2 years";1;0;False;trrrrouble;dwrcjgu;Investing Tips from a Pro;8982l3;https://i.redd.it/un9mdgl9dlp01.jpg

"Having trouble finding that exact figure and can't recall where I first heard/saw it - maybe local radio - but it stuck.  The number isn't really that far fetched when you consider it includes the cost of police time, court time, ER visits, etc.   

Doing a quick search this morning there is more than ample evidence to show that it is cheaper to house them than ignore them.

Most articles I do find cite these two Rand studies: https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR1694.html and https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_briefs/RB10000.html

And I found this stating that its more like $40k so maybe I misremembered. http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/mar/12/shaun-donovan/hud-secretary-says-homeless-person-costs-taxpayers/

So, yeah, you're probably right - the $100k number is probably overstated.  However, the point remains valid - its cheaper to house them than leave them in their campsites.

Right now, if you follow the news, Orange County CA has recently forcibly emptied a large ""settlement"" and there is a lot of discussion about where to send them.  The judge making the calls seems determined to ""solve"" the homeless problem once and for all with an eye to becoming a model for the nation.

Because sometimes you need to buy things at that moment. If you need a car now, it makes sense to buy it now. Similarly for housing, food. Everything you buy for yourself is because you prefer having that thing now than having it later and having some extra money on top. With giving to charities (and given your original claim that it’s better to give more money later than less money now) that never happens, because you would always prefer to get more money to give to the charity later than giving them less now.;2;1;False;mariout;dwt2faw;Investing Tips from a Pro;8982l3;https://i.redd.it/un9mdgl9dlp01.jpg
