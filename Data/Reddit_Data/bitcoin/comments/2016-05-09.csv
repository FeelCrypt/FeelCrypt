"This is both logically and empirically false.  The creation of debt is often inversely correlated to inflation.  It depends largely on why the debt is being created and what the money is being spent on.  Very often countries create the most debt in *deflationary* scenarios to fight severe recession and because tax revenues fall during recessions.

The lenders have locked in rates and so are tremendously hurt by inflation.  Let's say I buy a 5-year corporate bond yielding 6% when inflation is running at 2%.  The next day inflation jumps to 7% and bond yields jump to 11%.  The price of my bond will likely fall by 25%, so I'll have an immediate huge mark to market loss, and I'll now be losing money on the investment because my cashflows are less than inflation.

You literally have it exactly backwards.  Inflation hurts rich lenders and helps poor borrowers.";1;1;False;errydaymf0;d2yokio;"WikiLeaks on Twitter: ""We'd like to thank #Satoshi hoaxer Dr Craig Wright for showing how bankrupt the fact-checking standards are at the BBC, LRB & Economist.""";4hozs5;https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/727562945840975872
