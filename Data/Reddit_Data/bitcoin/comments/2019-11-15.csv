"Here's a journal article on [Contraceptive Failure in the United States](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3638209/) 

You'll find plenty of information on both ""Typical Use"" and ""Perfect Use"" of all types of birth control, including condoms and the pill. Also it is a rare person that is using condoms \*perfectly\* every single time they have sex.

As you can see in the first table, even with perfect use 2% of women experienced an unintended pregnancy in their first year of use of the male condom, and 18% of women experienced an unintended pregnancy with typical use. 

It's a pity this sort of thing isn't just common knowledge. If it were, I think many more women would switch to an implanon or the newer type of IUD, both of which have less than 1% failure rate, and there's no concern over typical vs perfect use as it's a one time insertion by a doctor.";1;0;False;Neodymium;f7k4hmi;Is that true?;dwa78n;https://i.redd.it/y94rijisvny31.jpg

For some people. And itâ€™s not very clear how that works. Either way, doesnâ€™t change my point. If you use any form of birth control properly, youâ€™re very unlikely to have a pregnancy.
