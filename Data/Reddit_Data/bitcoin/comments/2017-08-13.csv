"Technically it's not hard at all to cash out. You just need to send your funds to an exchange, sell them, and withdraw to a linked bank account. 

However, reality is much different because of oppressive financial regulations like AML/KYC. You know how it takes an hour or two to open a normal bank account?

Oh for sure! Have you checked out bitgold/goldmoney? Their shtick is having real gold trade similar to bitcoin- each bit is backed by actual gold. One of the criticisms of bitcoin is that it isn't physically represented which is why people are afraid of cryptocurrencies. Goldmoney/bitgold would resolve that.

"**Seigniorage**

Seigniorage , also spelled seignorage or seigneurage (from Old French seigneuriage ""right of the lord (seigneur) to mint money""), is the difference between the value of money and the cost to produce and distribute it. The term can be applied in the following ways:

Seigniorage derived from specie—metal coins—is a tax, added to the total price of a coin (metal content and production costs), that a customer of the mint had to pay to the mint, and that was sent to the sovereign of the political area.

Seigniorage derived from notes is more indirect, being the difference between interest earned on securities acquired in exchange for bank notes and the costs of producing and distributing those notes.

The term also applies to monetary seignorage, where sovereign-issued securities are exchanged for newly minted bank notes by a central bank, thus allowing the sovereign to 'borrow' without needing to repay.

"""The price has always crashed higher than the previous all time high"" sounds like it's meaningful investment advice until you realize that it's obviously strictly true every single time and yet should give you no confidence whatsoever. Every new high along the way has been a historic high. Unless it crashes down to literally 0 (or whatever it was originally), it will obviously crash higher than a previous all time high. The point is - which all time high? What if he buys in now at $4,000, and it climbs to $4,100 before dropping to $500. There was an all time high lower than $500, so you're still right, but he lost a ton of money. 

That said, I know literally nothing about whether or not he should buy in now. Just take issue with that awful bit of logic. ";2;1;False;Jermo48;dlk0txk;Bitcoinity USD $4000 gif;6tcg99;http://i.imgur.com/TKiAJWX.gifv

What I mean to say is that this might be the lowest it will be ever again.

This not to say the other guy isn't right, and I would personally not buy on a huge upswing and rather wait out for the fall in price shortly after.";1;0;False;CyborgJunkie;dlk4p8x;Bitcoinity USD $4000 gif;6tcg99;http://i.imgur.com/TKiAJWX.gifv

The reality here is Bitcoin could be the next Beanie Baby. It's worth nothing unless other people are trading.

"Let me be clear, Bitcoin will almost certainly drop in price soon. Historically after large run ups in price, there's a crash. I expect this runnup to be no different. That being said, the price has always crashed higher than the previous all time high. And Bitcoin has risen in price exponentially since it was invented 9 years ago. There's no reason why it would slow down any time soon. Just remember though that you can't time the market, so don't try to pick the best time, just buy and don't sell it during the inevitable crashes to come over the years.

And yes Bitcoin is divisible so you can buy any amount you want. If you only want to buy $1 worth, you can. ";221;8;False;vdogg89;dljvmgf;Bitcoinity USD $4000 gif;6tcg99;http://i.imgur.com/TKiAJWX.gifv
"Could be. I've algo been hearing this for years. I sold some 20 bitcoins in 2012 with good gains but in retrospective that was an error. 

Only 0.02% of the money in the world is in bitcoin. I really think that it could go to 1% in the following decade, which being basically inflationary would mean a much higher price. Not forever, of course, just like with gold, not everyone will be investing in Bitcoin no matter what, but despide being 4.000 now I really think it could go to 10.000-50.000 in some years for this reason. 

There are also other interesting coins. My favorite altcoin is Monero. Unlike Bitcoin, it's completely private, both sides of the transaction and even the amount. It's total capitalization is very small right now but when you consider that 52 trillion dollars are hidden from the taxman (fiscal paradises, undeclared goods, etc) if only a minuscule part of that goes to Monero the price can shoot to the sky (they're less than 50 dollars right now).

"Pasting from a recent comment:

Technically it's not hard at all to cash out. You just need to send your funds to an exchange, sell them, and withdraw to a linked bank account. 

However, reality is much different because of oppressive financial regulations like AML/KYC. You know how it takes an hour or two to open a normal bank account? You have to provide an insane amount of personal information. The same is generally true if you want to convert cryptocurrency into fiat and withdraw it to your bank account.

I'll go into this briefly. Economics is not a hard science. While most economics experts believe a currency must be inflationary some do not. It's not surprising that most believe it does as that's the system in place today and it works ok ( though banks can centralize per, and people are slowly and invisibly taxed, among other interesting issues). Let's look at his home example or money lending allowing more people to buy expensive goods. It makes sense at first but only if you consider the price of expensive goods fixed. For example, if less people are lending money, then the demand for houses would drop. Prices would decrease. People wanting to sell and move would naturally lower their prices until demand catches up. Easy low interest lending is what caused the real estate bubble in part. Some people believe these artificial bubbles are a bad thing, some think them necessary. We don't really know what will happen with a deflationary currency, especially when it's going to work along side inflationary ones. While he thinks this is a long term insurmountable problem, he, and noone else I promise you, can prove that. Much like I can't prove otherwise. Time will tell, its a very interesting time in history, specifically economic history with so much fin tech coming up.;1;1;False;throwawaytaxconsulta;dlkdjh5;Bitcoinity USD $4000 gif;6tcg99;http://i.imgur.com/TKiAJWX.gifv

"Hi, I completely agree that less money will be lent out. That was my point, perhaps I didn't explain it well (I rarely do when typing on my phone). As less money is lent, people will not be able to pay as much for houses. Demand will drop (not directly because houses are ""necessary""  and supply is ""fixed"" but for all intents and purposes value will drop [we could probably argue here about the effect on rent prices etc]). Prices will drop. The people who were priced out (by not having access to loans)  can still outcompete their peers (their relative wealth didn't change just everyone had less access to money) and they eventually get the home for a lower price. This is obviously simplified and I'm taking a process that takes some time (market correction) and applying it to a single hypothetical family.

I agree, interest rates will be higher. But the rest of the economy changes with it (i.e. prices drop, savings grow). Do you see my point? I don't disagree with you or your logic, its just not a simple question or answer. There are books written on this subject, and honestly, both sides can make very strong cases.

It was at around 1500AD that the Mughal dynasty was in control of a significant landmass, even then much of the south was not in their control.

The Mughal Empire (Urdu: مغلیہ سلطنت‎, translit. Mughliyah Salṭanat) or Mogul Empire, self-designated as Gurkani (Persian: گورکانیان‎‎, Gūrkāniyān, meaning ""son-in-law""), was an empire in the Indian subcontinent, founded in 1526. It was established and ruled by a Muslim dynasty with Turco-Mongol Chagatai roots from Central Asia, but with significant Indian Rajput and Persian admixture through marriage alliances. The dynasty was Persianate in culture, with local influences visible in its traits and customs.

"**Psychological projection**

Psychological projection is a theory in psychology in which humans defend themselves against their own unconscious impulses or qualities (both positive and negative) by denying their existence in themselves while attributing them to others. For example, a person who is habitually rude may constantly accuse other people of being rude. It incorporates blame shifting.

According to some research, the projection of one's unconscious qualities onto others is a common process in everyday life.

">For example, if less people are lending money, then the demand for houses would drop. Prices would decrease. People wanting to sell and move would naturally lower their prices until demand catches up.

The point that I think you're missing here is that no matter what the price of a house is, interest rates will always be higher in a deflationary currency than under USD. This can be pretty simply derived from the laws of opportunity costs. This will always depress output, because there will always be fewer people willing to pay a certain interest rate than a lower interest rate. It might not put a huge dent in output, but it will be a permanent structural deficit of BTC. 

No amount of fin tech will change the laws of supply and demand and the laws of marginal cost and marginal benefit. If the opportunity cost of holding money decreases, less money will be lent out.

"You can always invest in BTC. If you're in for the money, you will only make profit when the price of BTC rises after you invested. Since one BTC is currently about $4000 many people feel like they have missed the boat and can't invest anymore. However it's not the current price, it's the change in price after you invested that determines your profit. Do you think BTC is going to rise more? Then invest. Do you think BTC has reached it's top price? Then don't invest.

In the Bitcoin subs some people are actually suggesting to stop working with BTC and start working with mBTC (millibitcoin), which is 1/1000th of a BTC. While 1 BTC = $4000, 1 mBTC = $4 so people might not think it's so expensive. Of course this is just psychological and doesn't make any difference in reality.

Satoshis are basically to Bitcoin what cents are to the dollar - except that one dollar = 100 cents, and 1 BTC = 100 million Satoshis.

"Imagine the following scenario: there is only you, an apple farmer, your employer, and one money in the world.

You cultivate one apple. Your employer gives you the one money. He keeps the apple.

You buy the one apple. Your employer (now merchant) takes the one money from you. You have the apple.

Next day, you cultivate two apples. Normally you would get paid one money for one apple, but there is only one money. So now you are getting paid one money for two apples. The value of an apple, and therefore your work, has vastly dropped simply because the amount of currency is static while the economic assets (apples) can grow.

If there was another apple farmer somewhere, his one money, the second money, would suddenly double in worth because of nothing. There is just no way such system could be called stable.

The alternative scenario is that you get paid one money for one apple. You don't get paid for your second apple. The economy breaks because there is not enough money to pay for services.";0;1;False;odraencoded;dlk0pti;Bitcoinity USD $4000 gif;6tcg99;http://i.imgur.com/TKiAJWX.gifv
"The currency is designed to be deflationary. At some point in the very far future, there will never be any new bitcoins made, while the number of bitcoins that exist on the market will continually decrease due to things like hard drives being corrupted or people forgetting their passwords. All this means that after, say, 2050, one can reliably expect a bitcoin to be worth more tomorrow than it is worth today. This is good, right? Wrong. This is because of what we use currency for. If I'm a bitcoin lender, I will be substantially less likely to lend out my bitcoin if I know it'll make me money if I do nothing (this as opposed to an inflationary currency that would incentivize lending). What this would do is put upward pressure on interest rates, reducing the number of people who can buy expensive things - fewer people can buy a house at 3% interest than at 1% interest. This permanently hamstrings output and is a problem that can't really be solved. But it isn't even the biggest problem. 

Volatility is always going to be an issue for bitcoin. Sure, we won't see the insane fluctuations in price we see now, but the total lack of a regulatory body like the federal reserve means that the price will always be subject only to market swings - there is no force in place to control the market price. This will, by definition, increase volatility. What this will do is, in conjunction with inflation, further disincentivize lending and raise interest rates. Think about it - if I'm a potential moneylender, why would I lend out my money when there's an equal chance it'll be worth +/-20% compared to other cryptocurrencies a year from now? Uncertainty about interest rates creates skittish activity and depresses an economy. Only this depression would be permanent, because there is no Paul Volcker to step in and save the day. I don't have the tools to say the magnitude of what would happen, but it nevertheless provides a major obstacle to its adoption - what government would knowingly adopt a currency that would permanently depress output and additionally removed their regulatory authority?

I believe the above to be nearly insurmountable problems for bitcoin as a currency of the future. They aren't necessarily indictments of crypto as a whole, but they highlight the fundamental problems of bitcoin that are, by design, nearly unfixable. All in all, I don't see bitcoin ever approaching the extremely optimistic guesses people have for its long-term value.

"Fixed supply of a currency means effective deflation:  if the economy stays flat then prices of goods (denominated in that currency) stay flat - but if the economy grows then prices of goods will fall.  So bitcoin is effectively deflationary.

If you were a govt using bitcoin to manage an economy, then this would be a problem - most economists think you need low levels of inflation, and most central banks try to achieve this.  

But of course that's not the kind of currency bitcoin is - so I disagree with u/GuyBelowMeDoesntLift that this is a problem, certainly not in the sense of affecting the price of bitcoin.  Most people considering investing in an asset or currency would regard fixed supply as a very good thing indeed.

You're right that if bitcoin is going from $0 to whatever its stable level will be, you'd expect that to be a rocky road, with lots of volatility.  ";29;0;False;jaydoors;dljy83b;Bitcoinity USD $4000 gif;6tcg99;http://i.imgur.com/TKiAJWX.gifv

"""A Brief History Of Crime: How The Fed Became The Undemocratic, Corrupt & Destructive Force It Is Today""

>History suggests that the only way to rein in the sprawling Federal Reserve is to end its money monopoly and restore the American people’s ability to use gold as a competing currency.

>The legislative compromise that created the Fed in 1913 recognized that the power to print money, left unchecked, could corrupt both the government and the economy. Accordingly, the Federal Reserve Act created the Federal Reserve System without a centralized balance sheet, a central monetary-policy committee or even a central office.

     

>The Fed’s regional banks were prohibited from buying government debt and required to maintain a 40% gold reserve against dollars in circulation. Moreover, each of the reserve banks was obligated to redeem dollars for gold at a fixed price in unlimited amounts.

     

>Over the past century, every one of these constraints has been removed. Today the Fed has a centrally managed balance sheet of $4 trillion, and is the largest participant in the market for U.S. government bonds. The dollar is no longer fixed to gold, and the IRS assesses a 28% marginal tax on realized gains when gold is used as currency.

     

>The largest increases in the Fed’s power have occurred at moments of financial stress. Federal Reserve banks first financed the purchase of government bonds during World War I. The gold-reserve requirement was dramatically reduced and a central monetary policy-committee was created during the Great Depression. President Richard Nixon broke the last link to gold to stave off a run on the dollar in 1971.

     

>This same combination of crisis and expediency played out in 2008 as the Fed bailed out a series of nonbank financial institutions and initiated a massive balance-sheet expansion labeled “quantitative easing.” To end this cycle, Americans need an alternative to the Fed’s money monopoly.

Yes there is an inherent cheesiness to bollywood films but films in India serve a different purpose than films in America. Films in India are more about escapism. India for the most part is still a very poor and working class country. Films that focus on the every day drugery dont do well in india as they do in america. There have been films in india that look at social issues, salaam bombay, earth, fire, kama sutra are all examples of these. However these films do better in the western world. 

Movies are very cheap and accessible in India and are filmed in a way that you don't need to know  Hindi to actually follow the plot lines. That's because India is huge and full of dialects and one movie has to work in a lot of areas.

Never invest more than you're willing to lose. Speculation is still basically gambling, although the odds are much better than at the craps table. With bitcoin, basically the longer you're willing to stay in for, the better your chance of a profit. (Or at least that has been the result so far, who knows what'll happen in the future.)

Secondly: BTC has been getting a lot of attention lately and gone up a lot. Typically huge spikes are followed by big (temporary) crashes. I'm 100% certain the same will happen this time too, but WHEN, and from/to what value is impossible to say. It may ""crash"" from $10k down to higher than where we are now. Or it may go from $5k down to $2000.

Just be aware that no investment moves in a straight line, and the people who bought at the previous all-time-high (ATH) had to wait a while before getting their money's worth back. (The people who bought high and sold after the crash because they got cold feet obviously never got their money back, so don't do that.)";1;0;False;nkorslund;dlk0epm;Bitcoinity USD $4000 gif;6tcg99;http://i.imgur.com/TKiAJWX.gifv

Since it's about as useful as a pre-paid Discover Card, and there is a million dollar theft every couple of weeks, I'm of the opinion that Bitcoin are ""overbought,"" or that the price has been driven up by speculation.

"Wheee, brain dump.

Most of what I say below will apply to other cryptocurrencies, but since we're in the Bitcoin sub I'm just referring to Bitcoin - other cryptos have different features, but the core functionality is similar.  This is also fairly high level (ELI5-ish), so don't necessarily take it as investment advice or an absolute reflection of the network, but it can get you started.

---

It's effectively like trading in a foreign currency.  As economies do different things, the value of it relative to your local currency will fluctuate. The biggest difference here with BTC is that it isn't backed by a country, it's backed by a decentralized network that processes and confirms transactions - effectively a worldwide currency with its own economy.  Similar to a normal currency, it can also be used to pay for things - I've actually purchased goods with it because it was easier than sending a check or working through a credit card form.  It even uses online exchanges to change your currency to/from Bitcoin (or other cryptocurrencies).  

Also, since it's a general point of confusion, you don't need to buy a full BTC to invest in it.  You can purchase fractions of a BTC, down to the hundred-millionth of a BTC.  Most people don't jump right in to buying a full bitcoin.

---

Since it's still relatively new, and seems pretty promising in terms of its features, people here tend to believe that BTC value will significantly increase in the long term - it's all crystal ball guess work, but the general feel is that $10k-100k/coin is likely on a long enough timeline.  The most realistic estimates I've seen so far are loosely $5k by end of year, $10k in about 5 years, and $100k in 10-20 years - but, again, guess work with lots of variables.  Besides the capabilities of the currency, most of the hope around it going up is the fact that major institutional investors haven't really started investing in it yet - we're effectively still in startup investment phases, proving that it's viable before big banks and places like Fidelity start buying into it, which will increase the value.  Some financial advisers are also starting to recommend it, like CNBC clips have been popping up a bunch recently.

As far as timing and what's going on specifically right now vs a few weeks/months ago, there was a lot of network uncertainty regarding some technical changes.  That recently got settled in a survival-of-the-fittest style split (""fork"") - with the change splitting off to its own network.  It's a cool setup, since if the network can't come to agreement on something, it can just split off a branch and actually give it a try to see which option works best.  As an investor, that works similar to a stock split - you start off with one share, and wind up with two (1 BTC, and 1 BCH in this case).

---

Most of the involvement from people here is in terms of just investing or using it for payments, but you can also setup a computer to verify transactions (no monetary benefit, just helps the network), and even set up a device to process transactions (""mine"" Bitcoin) - although that typically isn't profitable in the consumer space these days due to energy and equipment costs.

My involvement specifically is just on the investment side, although I think the backing technology is cool and try to stay read up on it (I'm a software dude, using cryptography to create a self-regulating currency is just awesome).  My experience from the US has been that it's pretty easy, but you should still take precautions, and don't expect to go from nothing to moving money around overnight.  You still need to follow local regulations, tax laws, etc. and those rules include some steps that can take a couple days to process.  I think my initial ""decide to invest"" to ""actually purchasing some BTC"" timeframe was around 3-4 business days, but now that it's all set I can pretty much purchase at the drop of a hat.

Definitely ask around here if you want to know more.  There's some occasional chatter about things like bank accounts getting closed or other things you might not expect, but if you just pay attention, do your research, and take precautions it should be pretty safe.";29;0;False;PaulJP;dljw9ed;Bitcoinity USD $4000 gif;6tcg99;http://i.imgur.com/TKiAJWX.gifv

"Two reasons:

1. confidence and thus price was suppressed for a long time because of political drama
2. positive feedback loop when demand increases against a completely inelastic supply

Of course, confidence can get too high and then the bubble pops. But one interesting thing about bitcoin's price history is that, so far, it has always come back stronger after a big bubble popped and this has happened 4 or 5 times already.

"If you want the truth cryptos are kind of an artificial market right now. Not to say they are useless. Coins like bitcoin, ethereum, and ripple are here to stay. A majority of bitcoin's use is just the trade of other cryptocurrencies and its unsustainable in the long run. It's like, imagine if half of the transactions using the USD were on the stock market. The worth of the Bitcoin and every other crypto is inflated because it is being traded between the same (not to make it seem like a small number, it's a lot of people) few million people and while cryptos serve a purpose there's nothing to make it seem like it will jump to being mainstream.

I had several bitcoins from many years ago when I first heard of them. I got them out of curiosity, then pretty much forgot about them because they were pretty much useless to me back then, just a novelty. Everytime I've heard about their value increasing, I tell myself that I need to figure out where my young, stupid self put them. I looked once before with no luck. I'm thinking that they are stored on one of my old hard drives,of which I have a ton of, or backups done on DVD-R (also have a ton of these). I just don't know where they are. They're probably in some encrypted folder, to which I don't remember the key ಥ﹏ಥ. ;1;0;False;jbus;dljzt1y;Bitcoinity USD $4000 gif;6tcg99;http://i.imgur.com/TKiAJWX.gifv

"Sold all my BTC today at $4100 (~1). My strategy is to make profit of the volatility, and you should too. No point in investing 1k USD @ 3000/BTC and wait 10 years. 
You should rather be part-time (10minutes per 3 days) investor that makes money off volatility. I jumped the wagon when BTC dropped to 1800, and after much thoughts I sold at 4100, netting cca $2300 in 3 weeks.

Had I been going the traditional /r/Bitcoin route, I would HODL for next 10 years.

This approach now gives me the freedom to invest in BTC once I feel markets are reluctant to buy. 

My only risk here is that the price will only go higher, which I doubt. There is a new maximum reached - $4100, and people who are responsible for the price have already doubled their investment, therefore I am expecting dip to 3k range that will last couple months.

So the strategy is to hold to my earnings and current free-to-invest amount of money in cash, and once the BTC price drops, invest heavily and wait.

Rinse and repeat ad infinite. Once the price reaches 22k USD/BTC in 2022, I will have already made 100k+ profit in these little trades.";2;2;False;holdagold;dlk2vg5;Bitcoinity USD $4000 gif;6tcg99;http://i.imgur.com/TKiAJWX.gifv

"Yeah. People always think about the chance of one of these new currencies going big and give up because its a tiny chance.  But its better to think about it in terms of cost vs reward. 

Because the cost of bitcoin was only like 1 cent each then. The cost to you of buying 1000 is basically 0, we lose 10 dollars on stupid stuff all the time. But the potential reward is massive.

From now on every time a new currency comes out that looks promising and is very cheap. I always buy some.  I won't miss the 10 dollars, but in a few months its suddenly worth 1 million and you're set for life.";4;0;False;haydengalloway23;dlkgcmg;Bitcoinity USD $4000 gif;6tcg99;http://i.imgur.com/TKiAJWX.gifv

- Mostly deflationary, vs government and central banks planned ""let's make everybody 2% poorer every year do they spent all their money on crap!"" 
- Safe from government or bank hands and runaway printing of money or bank account kidnappings (ask the Greek, Venezuelans, Albanians, Zimbabweans, 1930's Germans or Argentinians about the value of this). 
- Secure, un-forfeitable. 
- Private, if you never use a service that associates your public address with your real identity (Monero is much better at this, tough). 
- Easy to store (you could just print a paper with the private key and keep it on a safe place). 
- Almost infinitely divisible.

"**Greater fool theory**

The greater fool theory states that the price of an object is determined not by its intrinsic value, but rather by irrational beliefs and expectations of market participants. A price can be justified by a rational buyer under the belief that another party is willing to pay an even higher price. In other words, one may pay a price that seems ""foolishly"" high because one may rationally have the expectation that the item can be resold to a ""greater fool"" later.

So, would we see rise of a different Crypto currency or BTC will remain the king forever? I understand difference between Eth & BTC. I like Eth more, it's more reliable, stable and fast. But I do not see anyone transacting in Eth. Mostly I see litecoins  & Dogecoins. Also sometimes I'm confused in Eth & ETC.

"**Argument from fallacy**

Argument from fallacy is the formal fallacy of analyzing an argument and inferring that, since it contains a fallacy, its conclusion must be false. It is also called argument to logic (argumentum ad logicam), the fallacy fallacy, the fallacist's fallacy, and the bad reasons fallacy.

Fallacious arguments can arrive at true conclusions, so this is an informal fallacy of relevance.

We are just trying to value and frankly build Bitcoin right now. No one knows what the hell it is or what its best use cases will be. When we finally figure that stuff out the price will stablize and then hopefully it will be a currency. That being said I use bitcoin all the time but I use it because of ideological reasons not because it's the best currency ATM. ;2;0;False;Bitcoin_Acolyte;dljkp1a;$100 checkpoints be like;6t79hw;https://media.giphy.com/media/RnxAq60OO27S0/giphy.gif
Bitcoin is exceptionally rare. Twenty one million bitcoins will ever exist... But many have been lost, so no more then 21 million. That means that one bitcoin is as rare as 19 lbs of pure gold. ;2;0;False;imbandit;dljf9tb;$100 checkpoints be like;6t79hw;https://media.giphy.com/media/RnxAq60OO27S0/giphy.gif

if btc goes from buying a pizza to a graphics card in one day, someone will offer to sell you a pizza for the price of a paperclip because tomorrow it pays for 2 pizzas.

"I like the deflationary nature of bitcoin.  It gives shops a reason to want it and me a reason to save it.  It makes my buys more considered and less impulsive.  There is a criminal element but no currency has found a way to avoid it and unlike printed money, bitcoin has a 'paper trail'.

"**Cognitive dissonance**

In the field of psychology, cognitive dissonance is the mental discomfort (psychological stress) experienced by a person who simultaneously holds two or more contradictory beliefs, ideas, or values. The occurrence of cognitive dissonance is a consequence of a person's performing an action that contradicts personal beliefs, ideals, and values; and also occurs when confronted with new information that contradicts said beliefs, ideals, and values.

In A Theory of Cognitive Dissonance (1957), Leon Festinger proposed that human beings strive for internal psychological consistency in order to mentally function in the real world. That a person who experiences internal inconsistency tends to become psychologically uncomfortable, and so is motivated to reduce the cognitive dissonance: either by changing parts of the cognition, to justify the stressful behavior; or by adding new parts to the cognition that causes the psychological dissonance; and by actively avoiding social situations and contradictory information that are likely to increase the magnitude of the cognitive dissonance.

Inflation has caused just as  much damage to finance as deflation.  You have just accepted that your money is debased because you fear a boogeyman.   Governments have used your fear to steal from you by halving any savings you have every 20 years.  Bitcoin is a way to step off that treadmill. ;1;0;False;Frogolocalypse;dljh7p8;$100 checkpoints be like;6t79hw;https://media.giphy.com/media/RnxAq60OO27S0/giphy.gif
