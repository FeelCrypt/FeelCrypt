Visa is a payment provider that people can utilize to transfer USD. Bitcoin is also being used as a payment provider in this case which is why /u/witcoins is claiming they are not accepting bitcoins. But just as we would say newegg accepts visa we should also say they accept bitcoins. Even if they don't actually keep any bitcoins the currency they do utilize bitcoins the payment provider to accept payment.;3;2;False;;cin0r2z;"""If NewEgg ever starts accepting bitcoins, I will leave Reddit forever."" - /u/witcoins";29kmpp;http://i.imgur.com/vJ5NBqY.jpg

"> Even if they don't actually keep any bitcoins the currency they do utilize bitcoins the payment provider to accept payment.

But they aren't accepting Bitcoin then if they are not even wanting to hold on to Bitcoins. If the third party that Newegg uses to exchange Bitcoins for cash decides not to continue their partnership, Newegg would not continue to accept Bitcoins as a legitimate form of payment. 

If Newegg stopped accepting VISA, Mastercard, AmericanExpress, etc they would still take my money from other legitimate payment methods like Paypal or straight up cash. This is due to credit card companies not actually being a source of currency, but acting as a mediator for actual money (backed by a strong governing body). Bitcoin would be blocked off from larger markets entirely if third party companies don't exist to give suppliers cash for Bitcoins.";4;0;False;Evilan;cin1k5v;"""If NewEgg ever starts accepting bitcoins, I will leave Reddit forever."" - /u/witcoins";29kmpp;http://i.imgur.com/vJ5NBqY.jpg
"Hilarious.

The only way you can equate ""accepting VISA"" and ""accepting BTC"" is if you agree that both are currencies or that both are *not* currencies.

""Accepting VISA"" means ""accepting payments of currency by means of bank credit, guaranteed by the Visa corporation"".

""Accepting BTC"" is not the same thing because a Visa card is not a currency.";4;1;False;na85;cin1s2s;"""If NewEgg ever starts accepting bitcoins, I will leave Reddit forever."" - /u/witcoins";29kmpp;http://i.imgur.com/vJ5NBqY.jpg
