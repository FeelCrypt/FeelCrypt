" >It's not sustainable because eventually the number of people begging for money would far outnumber the early adopters who got their doge for free if the number of users increased, meaning the hand-outs couldn't be sustained.  

I have no idea what you're talking about here.  Begging for money?    

>Why would I buy a currency that doesn't serve a purpose, has a terrible dev team (blames their community for their forks and incompetence) and has the highest maintenance as a percentage of market cap (IMO a strong indicator of being overvalued).  

No cryptocurrency is perfect.  Bitcoin has been forked many times, and flaws like transaction malleability are still just now being discovered by services surrounding it.  Nobody considers the devs to be terrible because of that.  I was encouraging you to buy some DOGE not because I am trolling, but because it is increasing in value and has a supportive and positive community.  If you think talented programmers only flock to Bitcoin, you are wrong.  They flock to where there is money to be made and where it will be worth their investment and time.  

>Stop your trolling, I'm not going to buy Doge just so you can have slightly more wealth.  

I suppose I could debate the rest of your points line by line, but if you're going to dismiss me as a troll simply for disagreeing with you, the debate ends here.  Have a nice day.

"> You are expecting the cart to come before the horse. Bitcoin development is a processes, give it a second

I think that's what a lot of folks are missing.  I don't believe any of the current cryptos are the end-all-be-all of cryptocurrency.  Not Bitcoin, not dogecoin, not Litecoin or Peercoin or Verticoin or Africoin or whatever other *Coin that's emerged so far.  They're experiments - compelling ones, to be sure, and very promising for a future of decentralized currency and economic freedom, but experiments nonetheless, and should be treated as such in order to create a more robust long-term solution to the problems currently faced with mainstream non-crypto currencies.

Personally, I think dogecoin is accidentally innovative in its lack of a hard cap on the supply of currency; while that decision got plenty of flak for behaving opposite of what's expected of a cryptocurrency (usually with snide comparisons to fiat currencies), many of those criticisms fail to take into account the fact that dogecoin's ""inflation"" (we'll see if it actually amounts to being inflation) is both well-defined and tightly controlled (providing the perceived benefits of slightly-inflationary currency - namely, the ability for loans to operate without significantly hurting debtors *or* lenders) while still providing the benefits of a cryptocurrency (decentralized, anonymous, easy to use for electronic payment, etc.).  It's something that should be considered in the event that ""Bitcoin 2.0"" (whatever that may be) appears on the drawing board: is a fixed supply of currency really the best option for something that's meant to become a mainstream global currency?

Meanwhile, I'm sure other cryptocurrencies have their own innovative features that should be explored (I'm not familiar with very many other cryptos outside of Bitcoin, dogecoin, and a smidge of Namecoin, so I wouldn't know of any specifics here) and considered as influences for whatever becomes the ""ideal"" cryptocurrency that is taken up.  Whatever the case, it's important to not get caught up in one particular currency or another and forget that there's room for cryptocurrency in general to evolve beyond what we've currently conceived.  It's still a young concept; modern money has taken centuries to develop, and it's only logical to keep that in mind as we decide the future of an increasingly-digital global economy.";3;0;False;northrupthebandgeek;cfj4iax;Bitcoin takes a walk with Dogecoin;1y9s62;http://imgur.com/J2L64cX

">Neither does Bitcoin. Neither does reddit. What's your point?

They serve a purpose, Doge doesn't. I see what you're saying though, ""need' is the wrong word.

>It's not sustainable because... you say so?

It's not sustainable because eventually the number of people begging for money would far outnumber the early adopters who got their doge for free if the number of users increased, meaning the hand-outs couldn't be sustained.

>If you're smart you would buy a little like I did and join in the community's efforts.

Why would I buy a currency that doesn't serve a purpose, has a terrible dev team (blames their community for their forks and incompetence) and has the highest maintenance as a percentage of market cap (IMO a strong indicator of being overvalued).

Stop your trolling, I'm not going to buy Doge just so you can have slightly more wealth.

>Dogecoin is just as much a store of value as Bitcoin is.

Never claimed it wasn't. I was just pointing out that bitcoin hoarding didn't make it less of a currency. Of course the validity of Dogecoin being a store of value is the answer to the argument we're having.

>The difference here is, you feel threatened by DOGECOIN whereas the people making the arguments before were fiat supporters feeling threatened by Bitcoin.

None of my arguments can be applied to Bitcoin because Bitcoin actually solved a problem and was designed to be more than a speculative tool. I am not threatened.

You can see a thread of twitter posts regarding the main post. They are basically confirming that litecoin's implementation of scrypt does not use enough ram to be resistant to ASIC hardware (which is their primary claim of usefulness/security). Dogecoin was derived from litecoin. I am assuming that litecoin's implementation of scrypt  proof of work was not modified because it was originally meant to be a joke, so it not much of a leap that they didn't put much work into changing the protocol.

Transaction malleability isn't a flaw, it is a part of the system that is well documented and http://bitcoin.it/ explains how to work around it.

It can't increase value forever. It is good for the community who already owns Doge, but once it collapses, it is bad for the members who just bought in and didn't sell in time.

>If you think talented programmers only flock to Bitcoin, you are wrong. They flock to where there is money to be made and where it will be worth their investment and time.

"I don't think you've addressed his comment, though.  This doesn't have to do with the market cap nearly as much as it has to do with changes in value over time.

Say you want to buy a house.  The house currently costs 200 BTC, but you only have 10 BTC and are (subtracting, for example, 2.5 BTC of bills and taxes from a 3 BTC monthly salary) experiencing a net gain of .5 BTC per month.  The logical step here would be to take out a mortgage loan for, say, 190 BTC (using your 10 BTC for a down payment), with a monthly payment of 2 BTC.  If your current rent is 2 BTC, then you're still experiencing a net gain of .5 BTC.  For now, all is fine and dandy.

Then, however, suppose the value per BTC doubles after a few months.  Your non-mortgage bills and your salary will certainly adjust as the BTC-relative prices of goods and services drop - probably to 0.25 BTC and 1.5 BTC, respectively.  However, your mortgage payment (assuming we haven't changed anything about how loans currently work) is still contractually defined to be 2 BTC.  This is now a problem; it means that a mortgage payment that was once somewhat affordable is now beyond your reach, since - even if you somehow eliminate all your bills - you're still 0.5 BTC short of your mortgage payment each month.  You'll need to renegotiate your contract or sell your house; the former will probably be difficult (since lenders don't like losing money), while the latter is of limited utility, since your house - which was worth 200 BTC when you bought it - is only worth 100 BTC now.  Depending on how long you've owned your house, you may or may not be able to pay off the rest of the loan, putting you in a rather dire situation similar to that of many homeowners when the housing bubble crashed in the latter half of the previous decade.

This is merely one example of why I don't think Bitcoin is perfect by any means, and why those holding Bitcoin on a pedestal and dismissing alternate approaches are - in my opinion - unwise.  Bitcoin is able to act as an effective medium of exchange, but it's not a consistent store of value or unit of account, and - if it's to be taken seriously as a proper currency rather than merely being a cash cow for the lucky early adopters - it needs to adapt to the real-world scenarios in which existing currencies are being used.

tl;dr: Bitcoin has some strengths, but its weaknesses are very much apparent as soon as the concept of a Bitcoin loan is introduced, and said weaknesses need to be addressed and corrected for cryptocurrency to effectively replace existing government-backed currencies in a real-world setting.";1;1;False;northrupthebandgeek;cfj4pqo;Bitcoin takes a walk with Dogecoin;1y9s62;http://imgur.com/J2L64cX

"Originally your statement was that DOGE doesn't ""need"" to exist.  Now you're changing that to ""serve a purpose.""  If you want to talk about purposes now instead of the necessity of existence, we can do that too.  

They both serve purposes because they are different.  There will be an infinite number of DOGE created.  Some people think this is a bad thing.  Others think it is good because it encourages spending, something that many people argue Bitcoin savers/hoarders struggle with right now.  It also encourages mining forever, something Bitcoin cannot say will happen without transaction fees going through the roof.  However you feel about that property, it's a pretty cool thing because all the other cryptos have finite limits so this is a first ""inflationary"" property we've seen (although it could still be deflationary as long as demand exceeds supply).  Moreover, it will have the last coin mined next year, far sooner than Bitcoin, which will provide insight as to what to expect when the last Bitcoin is mined, something that has people stumped.

It is a thriving community that has supported some very real charities.  Another purpose which may be insignificant to you, but to the people DOGE has helped, far from it.  Oh yeah, and when the dogewallet hack/theft occurred, the community pulled together and reimbursed those that lost their coins.  I have yet to see anything remotely close to that happen in Bitcoin.  The prevailing attitude is ""you moron, you shouldn't have used an online wallet.""  That's turning a lot of people off.

So you have two different communities with different priorities and properties.  But to go back to your argument that Bitcoin is a currency, of course I agree with that.  But if anything, right now, I would say DOGE is acting more like a currency because people are tipping and spending it freely instead of hoarding it.  That is the hallmark of a currency, is it not?

">If it doesn't serve a purpose, it doesn't need to exist. I was explaining why it doesn't need to exist.  

But DOGE does serve a purpose.  Several, in fact.  I outlined them above.  Even still, you're right, it doesn't NEED to exist.  Neither does Bitcoin.  Neither does reddit.  What's your point?  

>This isn't sustainable and has no relevance in the matter of whether Doge is a pump and dump (unless you want to use the fact that good press is good for pumping the value).  

It's not sustainable because... you say so?  I think you underestimate the community.  It surpassed the number of subscribers to /r/Litecoin in two weeks time.  It is on schedule to surpass the number of subscribers to /r/Bitcoin by the end of this year, easily.  You feel threatened by this for some reason, but you shouldn't.  If you're smart you would buy a little like I did and join in the community's efforts.  
 
>You seem to misunderstand the purpose of currency. A currency is for transacting and a store of value. Also, it is very foolish to imply that no one is spending bitcoins. http://blog.bitpay.com/2013/12/11/bitpay-exceeds-100-000-000-in-bitcoin-transactions-processed.html

Dogecoin is just as much a store of value as Bitcoin is.  When I bought in, it was at 45 satoshi / DOGE.  It is now at 225sat.  The best part about all the arguments you're making is that they've all been made against Bitcoin in the past as well.  The difference here is, you feel threatened by DOGECOIN whereas the people making the arguments before were fiat supporters feeling threatened by Bitcoin.  

It's okay to feel threatened.  Perfectly natural, but don't let your fear cause you to try to invalidate DOGE because you may find that you are invalidating Bitcoin at the same time.

">Now you're changing that to ""serve a purpose."" If you want to talk about purposes now instead of the necessity of existence, we can do that too.

If it doesn't serve a purpose, it doesn't need to exist. I was explaining why it doesn't need to exist.

>It also encourages mining forever, something Bitcoin cannot say will happen without transaction fees going through the roof.

Transaction fees may go through the roof. It is inevitable for any currency that requires people to have every transaction ever on their harddrive because you must have something limiting people from adding 1gb to the blockchain daily. There are ways to pay smaller transaction fees when those tx fees are high such as using ultimate blockchain compression.

>However you feel about that property, it's a pretty cool thing because all the other cryptos have finite limits so this is a first ""inflationary"" property we've seen (although it could still be deflationary as long as demand exceeds supply). Moreover, it will have the last coin mined next year, far sooner than Bitcoin, which will provide insight as to what to expect when the last Bitcoin is mined, something that has people stumped.

Dogecoin definitely isn't the first inflationary currency. It is also inflationary purely because of the incompetence of the devs. They didn't mean to make it inflationary when they originally cloned Litecoin.

>Oh yeah, and when the dogewallet hack/theft occurred, the community pulled together and reimbursed those that lost their coins.

This isn't sustainable and has no relevance in the matter of whether Doge is a pump and dump (unless you want to use the fact that good press is good for pumping the value).

>But if anything, right now, I would say DOGE is acting more like a currency because people are tipping and spending it freely instead of hoarding it. That is the hallmark of a currency, is it not?

You seem to misunderstand the purpose of currency. A currency is for transacting *and* a store of value. Also, it is very foolish to imply that no one is spending bitcoins.

If you thought it would get to $1/coin when it was ""fixed"" that means you'd have a market cap of $100 billion dollars. Let's say it took 3 years to accomplish that cap. Well, in three years there would be a 115 billion coins now in circulation. So what is 15% more to ensure that the coin is actually around?

Not sure why you're being down voted, it is a very real possibility, and you are right about the early bitcoin community being similar. I do however think there are some important differences that may help to mitigate some of the ill effects.  First off, bitcoin has already been through the growing pains that does has gone through and has yet to face, so while there are many bumps ahead the community has a precedent to look upon. Dogecoin already has a ton of people focused on 'srs bsns', and it hasn't killed the community yet. It's already faced several pump and dumps and crashes and come out seemingly unscathed.

Take a look at /r/dogecoin, it defently has something to offer to crytocurrency.;1;0;False;wcb98;cfjj7gc;Bitcoin takes a walk with Dogecoin;1y9s62;http://imgur.com/J2L64cX

I don't think he meant  implode as in disappear, just that in the case of dogecoin, the effect of becoming valuable (and therefore serious) will cause a change in the absolute foundations of the community.;6;1;False;Borax;cfj416h;Bitcoin takes a walk with Dogecoin;1y9s62;http://imgur.com/J2L64cX

"The primary reason that litecoin went with scrypt was to prevent ASIC technology, which they believe will eventually result in centralized mining. Since their implementation of scrypt is flawed, and makes the proof of work system compatible with ASIC technology, their primary ""benefit"" of litecoin vs bitcoin goes out the window.

Dogecoin very much didn't care about such details because it was implemented, literally, as a joke, and went viral because it was cute.";2;0;False;AgentZeroM;cfjclw3;Bitcoin takes a walk with Dogecoin;1y9s62;http://imgur.com/J2L64cX

"> Why would you spend a currency that could be worth more in a year? 

Why would you spend money on *other* things if you could spend it on bitcoin and make it worth more in a year? You have to take in account [opportunity costs ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost): 1 BTC spent now on a tablet has exactly the same ROI as $600 spent now on a tablet, because you could have spent that $600 on buying 1 BTC.
