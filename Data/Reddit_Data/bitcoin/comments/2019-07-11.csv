"I really don't know, but it was 50 coins per block.

It was not uncommon for a 'household miner' (meaning a gaming rig miner) to get 2,500 coins over a time - say about a year.

But BTC got released Jan, 2010. Once it hit over $20 on the exchanges, it was already using USB miners (cost like $40 to $200). While it seems trivial, USB miners of $200 mine 100x faster than graphic cards costing $200 - meaning it was already unprofitable to mine within the US without them.

3,000 coins is 10 hours of mining time... meaning there were as few as 850 or so people mining during the first year.";1;0;False;Bitcoin1776;etigkxr;This sure did age well;cbalwd;https://i.redd.it/3x51z28nyd931.jpg

I have little knowledge about the actual mining business, perhaps you can fill me in? How much Bitcoin could you have mined with an average gaming rig back running 24/7 in let's say early 2012?;1;1;False;toodrunktofuck;etidcdt;This sure did age well;cbalwd;https://i.redd.it/3x51z28nyd931.jpg
"I grew up Baptist, when I was younger and well into my 20s I believed exactly what you are saying...

Then, I started questioning everything, all my preconcieved notions about everything and I became more of a libertarian.  In my 30s I became self employed and was a business consultant.  I'd post ads on CL for everything business related.  I charged $75/hr.

a few years into doing this I had two escorts contact me wanting me to help them.  I met with them and they changed my mind about what escorting is.  I researched escorting etc and I had them each making six figures a year doing escorting on their own (i had them ditch their pimps).

Is there a shady underbelly to prostitution?  Absolutely.  But there is with everything.  When I worked for a big corporate firm you wouldn't believe how much carnage we did bankrupting businesses and destroying mom and pop shops just so our stock price would raise $1 next quarter...

There are plenty of sane people with great personalities and dispositions that do escorting work and they genuinely love what they do.  They like sex, they like helping people, they are selective in picking their clients, in short, it is not what you and Hollywood would have you believe it is.  Not to say, the dark side doesn't exist, sure it does.  All I'm saying is it isn't what you think and there are great positive aspects of it.  

I realize I'm not going to change your mind.  For every positive anecdote I write I'm sure you can counter with a negative one.  

All I will say, is once I thought as you thought, then after seeing it first hand and researching it, my mind and perspective were changed.";1;0;False;harrysapien;etirud9;This sure did age well;cbalwd;https://i.redd.it/3x51z28nyd931.jpg

"lol i can apply my righteous indignation how I see fit, and I choose to do so on people who sell their holes to strangers for money

&#x200B;

It's not a good career choice for a multitude of reasons, least of which is being a crime. That's literally the least of the problems. Do you honestly think a well adjusted person will sell their body? And I'm obviously including the people who marry for wealth. They are not productive citizens in any manner of the word. People like you who enable their self destructive choices are doing them harm.";1;1;False;LifeOverLaw;etiows3;This sure did age well;cbalwd;https://i.redd.it/3x51z28nyd931.jpg
