"Good points, I must admit.

Especially (2) was a new insight to me, thanks. Transaction fees indeed impose a significant limit on bitcoins divisibility.

With regard to the forks, I guess it matters only to those that call any of the alternative chains 'bitcoin'. People that favour BTC can ignore the forks as if they never existed (or sell them for free money indeed).

Re 3, I think bitcoin does stimulate services like paypal, banks, etc. to implement/continue to offer rapid, cheap money transfers. Only just this month will my European bank begin to offer 'flash payments' within the EU. They are catching up, which is very good. I think they feel the heat. Waiting for 2 days for money transfers over a weekend is not reasonable anymore in this day and age.

"> I have never seen a cryptocoin that's stable. 

Have you ever seen a stable fiat currency that's less than 10 years old and has a theoretical market cap of less than $70 billion?

> The very fact that I'm involved with cryptocurrencies and have learned how they operate on the technical level, shows that I have an open mind.

Hahaha! Sorry, this made lol IRL. You're mind isn't even open enough to consider than you might not have as open of a mind as you think. That's just.. that's just too ironic. I can't handle it. But you've convinced me fine roboto. `humanFriend++`.
