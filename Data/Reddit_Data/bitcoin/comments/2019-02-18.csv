"Dear  globalistas  
When using bitcoin to pay at the point-of-sale or for a face-to-face transaction, there is the problem of how to communicate the Bitcoin address to be paid in a way that the person paying can use.

A bitcoin address is just data, but it is between 27 and 34 characters so that is way to much info to expect the person paying to have to manually type in.

A QR code can easily represent this amount of data in a machine-readable manner and do so reliably. The QR code can contain other information as well -- such as an amount and a message and other fields as well";-1;1;False;Stratlight;egrbfz9;Upgrade Man!;arwyl0;https://i.redd.it/5vtaxk3pqbh21.jpg

"Specifically the problem I was dealing with was that I couldn't tell one piece of inventory from another if someone unpacked a box and then repacked it. All of them looked the same to me on the per-each level, so I'd have to piece together the transaction history to ""guess"" which boxes could theoretically have older inventory in them.

We were trying to get older products off the shelf that had some plastic material in them that California made illegal to sell for some reason so that we didn't have to keep track of which products we could & couldn't sell to California at the time (Prop 65 if I remember correctly).";3;1;False;unconscionable;egrbhqo;Upgrade Man!;arwyl0;https://i.redd.it/5vtaxk3pqbh21.jpg

"Fun fact! Those types of EAN/UPC Barcodes with the lines are still ubiquitous in modern warehouses, despite being far more primitive. The reason is that the fancy QR codes tend to not perform as well in more rugged conditions, i.e. being exposed to sunlight for 6 months & fading, damage to half of the code, etc.

It's kindof unfortunate - I was a programmer in a large warehouse for a few years, and would have loved to cram other little bits of data into some of the barcodes we were generating (i.e. a unique UUID code for each tiny item so we could track things more granularly and know how long they have been in stock without having to piece together a best-guess with transactional metadata).
