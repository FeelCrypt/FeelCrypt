I completely agree. I am not saying that Ulbricht's philosophy or position is completely wrong. I really dont see the difference between weed and Big Macs either, and I have never done illegal drugs intentionally. My point is that we all tend to take political positions that facilitate how we want to live our lives. If I did illegal drugs, I would be against their illegality too, whether I realize that my political position is self-serving or not is another question. I am saying that he has a personal interest in his political position, his libertarian political position is tainted, not that it is wrong. My point is that he is human, apparently intelligent, but not a genius because he is not aware of how his lifestyle affects his political views. Maybe I am wrong, maybe he would have been a hard-core libertarian whether he had a drug predilection or not, but that is the feeling I get from the book and the documentary, he was pretty much a normal guy who found the tools to enable others with similar habits, and he didnt acknowledge that the tools he was using enabled a lot of worse behavior too, and his greed and hubris caused him to go overboard and try to kill or harm people who abused his trust.;1;0;False;InigoooMontoya;dn6ko8k;Hi, my name is Ross Ulbricht;6cp2ql;https://i.redd.it/djb8i3hoh3zy.jpg
"> He should have received 20 to 40 years in jail, and to never profit a dime from what he did on the Silk Road.

I agree with this, life without parole should be reserved for gruesome murders but I suppose Americans are free to run their legal system how they choose. Could get the death penalty in some countries. 

Most of what you said about drug attitudes is fair in some cases but I wouldn't always make that generalisation. Some people don't like drugs but still support their legalisation. ";1;1;False;quasielvis;dn5p8bz;Hi, my name is Ross Ulbricht;6cp2ql;https://i.redd.it/djb8i3hoh3zy.jpg
The answer is: don't think about it and come watch tv. ;1;0;False;Kain_niaK;dn5wyqf;Two biggest Bitcoin subs according to their counterparts (posted on both subs);6rjzu2;https://i.redd.it/hl4l7joqnpdz.png
">Do fractional reserve banking systems produce more growth than full reserve systems would over the long term when you factor in how much wealth is destroyed during the crises and the bailouts that happen afterward?

Hard to say full reserve models are completely untested. Saving in a full reserve system would have to be done almost entirely through equity and bond markets, or through time deposits. What would likely happen is that the government would lend banks money which banks would loan out at higher interest rates. This effectively gets rid of endogenous money, and lets the government have complete control over the money supply.

A large issue is that this would likely not prevent economic collapses. Commercial banks wouldn't fail, but the economy would still be vulnerable to recession, commercial banks are only a small portion of lenders. Non-Depository banks and Shadow banks would still be lending, they just don't have deposits as liabilities. In the last recession the only reason commercial banks were failing is that they bought securitized assets made by shadow banks.

>Another factor here is that by keeping interest rates low, you deprive the economy of the due diligence

Not really. No matter what the interest rate is if the borrower defaults the bank loses tons of money.

>what do you think will happen with bitcoin?

Bitcoin's value is based on its ability to buy drugs, and speculation. It has huge scaling problems, which makes it inefficient as a payment platform. Other crypto-currencies may have specific uses, and blockchain technology as a whole has loads of uses, but Bitcoin would make a shitty currency. 

>I think it will relieve central banks of their ability to do QE

No it wont. There's literally no reason to think this.

>Do you think bitcoin will collapse on its own, or will governments rightfully shut it down.

Bitcoin will always have value as long as there's speculators, and as long as you can buy drugs with it. If governments try in earnest to shut it down, the speculators are gone. If the darknet sites get shut down, then it loses almost all of it's transaction demand.

No, simply use the blockchain, start with one address, pay to 21 addresses a small amount of Bitcoin, give a single private key to each buyer, in the future they can pass along the key if they sell it, buyer would move money to new address and hold both keys etc.

"The dotcom comparison doesn't work here for a few reasons.

1. Unlike the companies in the dotcom bubble, bitcoin already exists and functions.
2. The dotcom bubble was caused by speculation but not adoption. Cryptocurrencies are experiencing actual adoption. Also, crypto doesn't have nearly as much money in it as the dotcom bubble.
3. There are already other technically superior coins but bitcoin has not been wiped out because of metcalfe's law, and because it only needs to compete with savings/gold, not every economic function.

There's still some amount of risk in bitcoin but it only needs to be good enough to suceed at this point.

Dotcom bubble crashed because it was a bubble. When 90% plus of people begin buying something for speculation only you have a bubble that can burst. I'm willing to bet 99% of people holding btc only do it for the dollar gains, which is evident because price exploded this year as it got more media attention and that causes even more people to buy and bid it up. Bitcoin may be around long-term but it can crash anytime and a lot of people will get fucked, I trade in and out buy low sell high so I'm the one that's going to do the fucking as I sell at the top to some unsuspecting guy once again. ;1;1;False;2Cups_Pens;dn6mh6k;"My father has recently fallen in love with Bitcoin and has started painting Bitcoin art themes, I present to you his first: ""The Bitcoin Bull"" by Ludvig Manukyan.

*Showcase of a Giclée print example and COA*

------

Name: The Bitcoin Bull

Series #: 1 of 2

Artist: Ludvig Manukyan

Size: 24” x 36”

Surface: Primed Canvas

Medium: Acrylic 

Dated: August 23, 2017

Statement from the Artist: To the left we are met with a raging bull preparing for another charge against a large wall. The bull coupled with an upwards-facing, golden Bitcoin symbol that he is seen to be carrying represent the start of a bull market and a rise in the value of Bitcoin. The wall is composed of large rock formations that can be construed as the very blocks that make up Bitcoin. The wall can also be more appropriately interpreted as a market ‘ask’ wall that the bull is hammering down and must overcome. The wall contains hints of green to symbolize the current USD paradigm. The painting also features warmer tones to emphasize on the stresses, frustrations, and uncertainties of the market. 

-----------

We are also releasing 21 limited edition copies that are signed and numbered. The copies will feature fine Giclée prints on canvas and will match the original size of 24” x 36”. Each print will be signed by the artist, dated and uniquely numbered. Certificate of authenticity will also be provided with each print. Please note that stretcher bars and frames are not included. If you are interested in reserving or purchasing, please visit our page on Bitcointalk. Those who purchase ""The Bitcoin Bull"" will have the option of ordering the 2nd of the series, ""The Bitcoin Bear"" (same number) upon release.

"No Anarchism is no Hierarchies, just more examples of you guys stealing our terms and pretending to be like us. And Capitalism is a hierarchy. 

Also, don't try and act like Hayek is a nobody. He is the most influential person in the Austrian School. And a Minarchist? Hardly. Again he supported dictators and believed in tyranny. ";1;1;False;Rev1917-2017;dn59hd7;Probably JP Morgan;709hed;https://i.redd.it/iqpmt8c4i1mz.png
The very guy you base your ideas off of didn't even believe in them. He believed in tyranny. And you have become delusional enough to think that Anarcho-Capitalism, which is not even a form of Anarchism, is anything other than a tool to subjugate you and everyone to new neo feudal lords. Your delusions are outstanding. ;1;1;False;Rev1917-2017;dn565ll;Probably JP Morgan;709hed;https://i.redd.it/iqpmt8c4i1mz.png
"There isn't one all important guy, and Hayek was a minarchist so there are many things he believed with which I disagree. Real ancaps don't just parrot someone else's theory they understand principles and apply them to the world for themselves.

But if you want some ancaps who get most things right you can listen to Tom Woods on his podcast, or read some of his many books, or join his online educational program. You can listen to Dave Smith on the Part of the Problem podcast, or Brett Vinotte on The School Sucks Podcast, or you can read the mountain of readable content produced by Murray Rothbard. I don't know why you would spend so much time fixated on Hayek.

Anarchism is just a lack of involuntary political authority over others - ""no rulers""

Capitalism is just free trade with respect for property ownership. I'll assume you own a pillow and a computer, so you own the means for producing more comfortable sleep and all sorts of media.

No one is pretending to be anarchist in an effort to be like ancoms - no one wants anything to do with violent people that have a tendency to fling their own fecal matter. 

It's just the basic etymology and definitions of the words that leave us with nothing more accurate to describe our positions. Monarchy is government with a single ruler, oligarchy is a government with a ruling group, minarchy is limited government, and anarchy is no government. 

The only meaningful definition of government that I know of is a political monopoly on the use of force and coercion. So anarchy would be no violent political monopoly. Which implies nothing about how people arrange themselves in the absence of a violent political overclass. It just suggests that all relationships/interaction when it comes to organizing society and distributing resources should be voluntary in order for there to be anarchy.

"Climate change tends to be unpredictable and only hit a small percentage of people at a time too. In practice, the insured wouldn't be insuring against worldwide climate change on a grand scale; they'd be buying individual disaster insurance plans that traders would bundle and resell to people who want to bet on wholesale climate change. Rising sea levels, hurricanes destroying their homes, floods, etc. Two big differences between crypto prediction markets and existing insurance firms is that they can't offer ""fractional reserve"" insurance (it all must be backed by actual coins), and the oracles deciding who ""won"" aren't the insurers themselves.

The premiums offered would go up along with the likelihood of a payout. If there were lower transaction costs and no threat from a PR backlash, companies would offer (expensive) medical insurance to people with preexisting conditions.

Insurance companies _can't_ fund defense right now; large scale polluters are protected by governments, and any insurer who would pay for defense would find themselves in jail. The costs of pollution are outweighing the benefits, but because the wrong people are being defended we can't really do anything about it. Like you said, they can't just pay people to not pollute; they need to physically stop people from polluting.

For this sort of mechanism to work, total transaction costs need to be extremely low, and an immense amount of capital needs to be in a censorship-resistant immutable financial system.

Insurance companies can only insure things that happen to small percentages of their customer base at a time, which also tend to be unpredictable.
