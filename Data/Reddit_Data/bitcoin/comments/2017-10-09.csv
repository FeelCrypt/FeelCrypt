"Statement only makes sense if we're still looking at the world through tribalistic eyes...  Could therefore be argued that the sale enabled us to get closer to the vision of true global unity (either by design or accident) which is really what this entire project is about.

"The thing is this was a boon for us.  The bitcoin community. It was the first sign that governments treated Bitcoin as somethibg of value.  

It also showed the way to sell then.  Auction them off.  

The rest of the world follows the USA blueprint so blindly.  Recently this copy/paste attitude has worked against us and works against freedom but this was one time it really helped.  

The world saw the Americans say ""Bitcoin is valuable.  Bitcoin is not explosives. Not cocaine. It's legal and ethical and moral to trade it""

"Having 1 BTC and selling it for $1000 is the same as having $1000 and not buying a bitcoin. In other words, the government's decision to sell 144,336 BTC is equally stupid as them not having had the 144,336 BTC in the first place but not choosing to buy 144,336 with whatever funds they had at that time. And yet we think they're acting rationally in the latter case but stupidly in the former.

"Philosophically that may be correct but practically it's not. 

If the government had started using public tax-payer funds to buy-up Bitcoins it would have raised questions and in the world of highly partisan politics people would have been all over the story like a rash.
