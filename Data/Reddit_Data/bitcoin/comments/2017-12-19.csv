I believe that it should be possible to avoid this in careful code (and Bitcoin Core is generally very careful). For example: Decode the address to a scriptPubKey, sign the transaction, then take the scriptPubKey from the signed transaction and reencode it to an address and check that they match. (This isn't perfect in the presence of faulty computing hardware, but it's at least going to save you to first order, since any bitflip after signature will make the signature invalid.);1;0;False;gwillen;drhhayp;I'm donating 5057 BTC to charitable causes!

"Dogs in shelters can be extremely different than the dog will be after it gets home. 

A lot of shelter dogs are very shut down and appear more calm than they are, because they are in that shut down state of shock. Once settled in they might exhibit way more behavioral issues than you are able to view in a shelter. 

""Guesses"" for dogs breeds from shelters are also often inaccurate and don't provide a real idea of what traits the dog may be predisposed to, or even their adult size when adopting puppies. 

""Honest descriptions"" are also not always true. Most of them are shallow descriptions sugarcoated. ""Needs an experienced owner"" was listed on a recent bully mutt a friend was looking at. Later find out: the dog had bitten the previous foster in the face. The shelter staff also often DONT have enough information on that particular dog to give an accurate description of what the dog is actually like outside of being confined to a kennel and taken for a short walk here and there.

"I don't often see posts about what it's like to own an ex breeder so here's mine.  Hopefully it will shed some light on the psychological damage that's done to these poor dogs.  I have an ex-breeding bitch.  Her last litter of pups died so she was of no value to the breeder any more.  I adopted her while she was still bleeding and full of milk.  That's how much these breeders care.  I got her spayed so that no matter what happened to me, she would never be bred again.  She has a terrible underbite and the vet said she should never have been bred.  She struggles to eat some things so her treats are broken into smaller pieces for her to manage.

I have never hit her, shouted at her or forced her to do things against her will.  I've used lots of positive reinforcement and every shred of patience I have to try to rehabilitate her.

It took a month to get her to the stage where she would consistently go to the toilet in the garden and not go in the house when I picked up the keys to unlock the door.

It took three months for her to start tolerating human company instead of hiding away in another room by herself.

It took her six months to realise she didn't need to inhale every meal or treat she got, and that nobody was coming to steal it from her.

After about nine months I finally caught her sleeping.  Up until then she would wake at the slightest noise and every time I looked at her she'd be staring back.  Even in the middle of the night.  That was a little creepy.

It took a year to get her to start volunteering to go for walks.  She would still prefer not to go but chooses to go with my other dog rather than stay in the house alone.  She only likes the park though.  She hates her lead and will try to bite it off, so we go to the park where she can run free.

After 5 years she still doesn't like children and won't allow them to approach her.  Once at the park there was a group of mums with babies in prams.  She freaked the fuck out like it was the village of the damned approaching.  I had to catch her, put her lead on and take her in the opposite direction or she'd have run away.  She ran away a lot, at the slightest provocation in the early years.  So we can only go to parks not surrounded by traffic.

She will immediately defecate if she's put into a scary situation e.g. if someone she doesn't know is standing between her and her only exit.  Every time we have people around, or go to the vet, or to a strange environment I have to make sure she's emptied her bowels beforehand.

It takes her a long time to trust new people so instad of taking her to a groomers I've had to learn how to do it myself.  She's had some really shitty haircuts, but at least she allows me to do it.

She's great indoors, in her own house, when no visitors are around.  She likes squeaky toys, she's smart and loves puzzles.  She obsessively cleans herself like a cat and if I run a bath she gets excited and puts her paws up on the edge hoping it's for her.  She would sell her soul for McDonalds chips.  But because she spent the first four years of her life in a shed I don't think she'll ever be completely normal. She's institutionalised for lack of a better word.

I know you have your heart set on this puppy already and it isn't the puppy's fault that these breeders are arseholes but next time, if you have an opportunity to adopt a dog instead of putting money into a breeder's hands, do that instead.";14;0;False;aye-aye;drgz30i;Sold some bitcoin to buy my new best bud 🤗;7kqq1j;https://i.redd.it/16bgn309ys401.jpg

Unless the pet store specially states that their puppies are rescue dogs then it will most likely be from a puppy store.

"I think his point and the point around this at all is about saving the dogs who are abandoned at shelters or found and kept at shelters, so you get a dog, save a life, and save money all at once. 

I agree because I think it's ridiculous to spend thousands of dollars on a dog. Like do they dip the dog? And what I also don't understand, is paying that much more for a dog, that is more than likely going to require even more money to care for, have special needs, and die sooner than a mutt you can find at the shelter. 

Also, I don't get you're third point. I have never had to jump through any hoops when getting a dog from a shelter nor have I heard or seen someone have trouble getting a dog from them. You literally walk in, find the dog you want, sign some papers, pay and leave with your new friend. 

While on the other friend I had a friend who recently had to wait over 2 months, go through a ton of paperwork and spend over $2000 just to get a puppy corgi, only to have the poor dog die due to illness within the first month of having it.

Her mother was a breeder and she herself began breeding at age 12. She’s now in her 50’s. Again, you brought your emotions into your comments and haven’t stated a single fact.

I agree about puppy mills and did a lot of research before getting our guy.

"It depends on the shelter, public ones don’t get much funding. Also there are rescues that work with fosters, where they are temporarily placed in homes with volunteers. I’ll use examples from the state where I live, the names will probably mean jackshit to you but it’s at least something. 

Yeah, for example AHS in Newark NJ is ass (they CONSTANTLY profit off neglect, I’ll give you that one), but for Liberty Humane Society in Jersey City is an amazing organization (I volunteer for them so I KNOW their behind the scenes), and so is Popcorn Zoo. The Monmouth County SPCA in Eatontown NJ is also amazing, they actually bought the space a puppy store had in the local mall and send some animals there to adopt. They’re super stringent about who they adopt out to, but their animals are really well kept- my friend adopted a cat there a few months ago and while we walked through the cat section was AMAZING. Another example, my dad’s neighbor runs a small cat rescue out of her house and I come play with the cats sometimes and it’s really nice but small. 

There are a lot of reputable organizations. State run ones can sometimes be corrupt, especially in bad high population neighborhoods where they get a lot of animals and can’t keep them all. But there are also tons of places that don’t profit on neglect. Liberty Humane does euthanize for space if they HAVE to, but have managed to avoid it for three years by having extensive fostering programs.";1;0;False;strive2bperfect;drh2njo;Sold some bitcoin to buy my new best bud 🤗;7kqq1j;https://i.redd.it/16bgn309ys401.jpg

At first, this makes a certain kind of sense. There seems to be a distinction between people who value an animal's life above a person and vice versa. I think it's important to recognise that attempting to do some good vastly outweighs accepting that everything is fucked and ignoring it. Sure, some advocate strongly for adopting animals. Others advocate for fair treatment of overseas workers. Really, the two groups share a common logic - humane treatment of sentient beings.

"That's a one sided argument. Some people need dogs for a lot of reasons. I know someone who trains and competes in agility contests with border collies. Those dogs don't even exist outside of breeders in this country. I guess he should just starve or not participate because he didn't happen to find one in a shelter. That's literally his only income. Train dogs in agility and participate in contests. 

Someone needs to train dogs for rescue or for blind people or whatever. I guess those people need to wait until the specific breeds or the specific dog and age are available at their current shelter before they can go on with their lives.

Oxymoron. They are part of the problem, even of they take good care of the dogs in their care. 30,000 dogs PER DAY get euthanized in the US alone, for lack of homes. PER FUCKING DAY.

Then at least they have to work harder to live in their denial about how they contribute to the mass killing of dogs.

">either way the other dogs need a home too.

This is true, but think bigger!  You're correct if you're thinking on one individual puppy.

But supply and demand is what fuels this all.  Think macroeconomics instead of micro.

Imagine if the number of pet store sales plummets by 75% in 2018.  These pet stores view their dogs as inventory, commodities, and profit.  If the market for buying new dries up, the pet stores lose money.  They don't want unsold puppies.  They order fewer puppies from their breeders.  Breeders can't turn as much profit so many of them exit the industry.  Fewer dogs in circulation means fewer dogs wind up in shelters to be euthanized without a family.  

Yes, the excess dogs that were bred in 2018 would be homeless.  A necessary evil, sadly.  But the effects on 2019 would be spectacular moving forward.

Even if you're an excellent pet parent who bought new from a pet store, you still helped fund and feed the whole industry.

"The short answer is no. See e.g. [Why is Deflation Bad for the Economy?](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/030915/why-deflation-bad-economy.asp). 

Aside from the way deflation inhibits spending, it also has other effects, like inhibiting loans - it either doesn't make sense to lend money, or if you do, the borrower has to pay a lot. This has a strong inhibiting effect on an economy.

Inflation often gets a bad rap, but if the underlying economy is growing, then it's natural for the supply of currency used to buy and sell things in that economy to grow also. One of the functions central banks perform is to try to adjust the growth of the currency in ways that support the growth of the economy.

Correct.

And the question is whether BTC will adopt in time, or whether it will be Flippened out before it does. E.g. a successfull lighning network might make a lot of altcoins that offer similar props (ripple, litecoin) far less interesting. 
Or, if BTC would adopt or even plan to do so, some Proof Of Stake, altcoins such as Peercoin or Dash have served their purpose as a fantastic test-bed but loose most of their benefits over BTC. 

BCC is, IMHO far too similar to Bitcoin to be of any real value. The very fact that r/BTC did not move their assets and mining to Litecoin but instead forked, proves -to me- that this is just a scheme by Roger Ver to keep benefitting from his ASIC miners.

"> well, isn't that how all currency works essentially? 

No.

> I could spend $700 on a puppy or I could put it in my IRA ad watch it turn into two puppies worth over a few years?

The growth in value in that case isn't due to appreciation of the currency, it's due to the interest based on investing that money in something other than the currency itself. 

The equivalent for the dollar would be if you kept it under your mattress for a few years, and then found at the end of that time, you could buy much more with it. Generally speaking, it doesn't work like that. If it did, people would tend to hoard dollars, spend less, avoid loaning money, etc., which has a negative impact on the economy.

> At some point we like things more than ANY currency and as long as both parties agree on the price/currency value ANY currency is useful for transactions.

""At some point"", yes. However, there's plenty of economic study of how the incentives and disincentives play out in these cases, and the general consensus is that deflationary currencies are not a good thing.

This dog ended up having a liver shunt and died just weeks after we got him. We realized after, this dog was FOR SURE sick before we ever bought him, and they sold it to us anyways. Fucked up on so many levels! We had to jump through so many hoops, between calling the store, going to speak with managers at the store, calling corporate...it was not a fun experience.

Exactly.  Good Breeders care about each dog and will always take a dog back so that their dogs don’t end up in shelters.  If more people went to good breeders there would be far less dogs in the pound.  We have a rescue and a bred dog and the dog from our breeder has far less behavioral problems.

">I’ve always seen

This may be an unintentional problem with the way you phrased the comment, but let's be real.  To say ""always"".... are you implying that you've never met anyone who hasn't regretted adopting a shelter dog?  How many have you met?  Lol the vast majority of people love their rescues.  My rescue Australian Cattle Dog is absolutely playful, energetic, smart, active, and awesome.  

I dislike the narrative that dogs only end up in shelters because something is wrong with them.  Overwhelmingly, it's because something was wrong *with their original puppy buyer*, who was unwilling to care for them.  They come in all sorts of varieties and personalities.

>What’s wrong with pet stores these days?

It's just very sad that the dogs in the shelters will either live out their days in captivity with no family to love, and in most cases they will be euthanized.  It breaks my heart.  Meanwhile, each puppy store (and there are dozens per state) is churning out 1000s of puppies a year as a commodity, as fast as they can, and people are willing to spend $3000 + $2000s in first-year vet visits surgeries and specialized puppy care needs.  They have every opportunity to save a dog's life and reduce the number of strays in the world, but instead they choose to exacerbate the problem by encouraging higher puppy production.  

If demand from pet stores decreased, then over a macroeconomic time frame, the number of breeders in operation would gradually slow down, and we'd have fewer dogs that ultimately end up in shelters in the first place.";2;0;False;McBurger;drh2f9d;Sold some bitcoin to buy my new best bud 🤗;7kqq1j;https://i.redd.it/16bgn309ys401.jpg

"**Glenn Hoddle**

Glenn Hoddle (born 27 October 1957) is an English former footballer and manager and current television pundit for ITV Sport and BT Sport who played as a midfielder for Tottenham Hotspur, AS Monaco, Chelsea and Swindon Town and at international level for England. He was most recently first team coach at Queens Park Rangers having been appointed, on a part-time basis, to assist Harry Redknapp in the summer of 2014. However, following Redknapp's resignation in February 2015, Hoddle also left the club.

In 2007, he was inducted into the National Football Museum Hall of Fame, which cited him as one of the most gifted English footballers of his generation, exhibiting ""sublime balance and close control, unrivalled passing and vision and extraordinary shooting ability, both from open play and set pieces"".

"A lot of people will say adopt, don't shop, but really the saying should be ""RESEARCH WHERE YOUR DOG IS COMING FROM.""

If it's coming from a breeder, it's your job to make sure that you're buying from a breeder that is breeding responsibly. 

If it's coming from a shelter, it's ideally the shelter's job to find a dog that is suitable to your lifestyle, and most aggressive dogs aren't really suitable for anyone's lifestyle, but this is just to say that shitty adoption shelters exist and sometimes they will try to pawn off an aggressive dog onto you. You do not have to keep an aggressive dog. It's not your fault that they lied to you. I don't think this happens very often, but it can.

If the dog is coming from a pet store, do not buy it, because that means it's coming from a non-responsible breeder (*unless* the pet store guarantees that it is working with a local shelter, and even then I would ask questions).";14;1;False;Brikachu;drgzqlx;Sold some bitcoin to buy my new best bud 🤗;7kqq1j;https://i.redd.it/16bgn309ys401.jpg

"Finally, some sanity in a reply. Going up against the hive mind is rough... Haha.

My friend just got his Golden from a breeder. They went to the breeder 3 different times (not counting obedience classes). 

They went up to do a face-to-face with the breeder and meet the Mom and Dad for the litter. The breeder interviewed them as well as took any of the questions my friend had. They gave their deposit at this time.

They then went up a week before the pups came home to pick out their puppy, and again, to interview with the breeder and ask any other questions. All of the families that were getting a pup were there, so as a group, they got to ask many questions, some of which my friend hadn't even thought of.

Finally, they went up to get their puppy. They signed a contract with the breeder that they would take the puppy back if they weren't feeling it, that they would come to obedience classes for the pup (that were included in the cost of the puppy), and that they would get the pup fixed ASAP and send her proof, otherwise she would take back the puppy.

"In what world does anyone get a say on how others spend their money?

I have had a couple street pups before my latest dog, and not a single one of them showed any loyalty to us. One of them my mother had to give away because it liked to jump at the clothing on the drying rack and tear it. I was too young to train it, and she was working too much to have the time to watch the dog 24/7 for a month to teach it to stop doing that

My second dog was well trained because I was older and was now capable, but didn't have an ounce of guarding instinct. The house got mugged three times before it died from the thief getting tired of feeding it poisoned meat each time he wanted to steal from us and decided to just shoot the dog and be done.

And the third dog, a mixed labrador, just got stolen because it was too trusting and liked to destroy our fence to wander around the neighborhood.

Then we spent money on a purebreed belgian shepherd, and we got a smart, loyal watch dog that wouldn't leave us unprotected for anything in the world. Sometimes buying a purebred pup is the only way to get a blank slate where you can train in the nehaviors you want, because they have been bred for generations to be well suited for the purpouse you need them for.

By all means, adopt from a rescue if all you want is a pet to sink time in with the only reward of a bit of love. But when you need a dog to fit a specifict purpouse, your only option is to buy a pup of the right breed.

And as long as you pay for it with your own money, no one else should have a say in what kind of dog you get.";0;0;False;RafeHaab;drgvznx;Sold some bitcoin to buy my new best bud 🤗;7kqq1j;https://i.redd.it/16bgn309ys401.jpg

"http://www.onegreenplanet.org/animalsandnature/why-breeding-dogs-is-a-problem-even-if-the-breeder-is-reputable/

That article you linked raises decent points, but it's also pretty obscure and somewhat anecdotal. Anyway, I didn't think it needed to be said that if you're getting an animal, whether it's adoption or from a breeder, it's always a good idea to get to know the pet via a few supervised meetings prior to pulling the trigger. That's irresponsibility on the part of the owner, imo, and is not reflective of the ""danger"" in adopting. If a dog is aggressive, that behavior will be apparent if you do YOUR due diligence as an owner. Have children? Introduce before you buy. Have other animals? Introduce before you buy. Your argument basically hinges on the idea that people aren't fully vetting the animal and figuring out whether or not they're a good fit for themselves. Spoiler: that's why most dogs (from breeders) are abandoned and become dangerous, nasty shelter dogs to begin with. Please educate yourself. 

Following up on my question from before though, I'm assuming the answer is no? You've never adopted a pet? Yeah. Didn't think so.";8;0;False;cavernph;drgotca;Sold some bitcoin to buy my new best bud 🤗;7kqq1j;https://i.redd.it/16bgn309ys401.jpg

I'm wrong for sure, just never knew people spent so much time and considered things like that when getting a dog. I guess because the idea of getting a dog to me, has always been about saving the dog and putting it in a place where it is comfortable, can be happy, and live a good life. 

I never looked at a dog from a view of trying to fit it into making it about what I wanted, down to the specifics of things like energy and mood or whatever. Because to me, getting a dog isn't a gift or a some kind of thing to bring me pleasure happiness or anything like that, but it's all about the dog. 

I care more about the dog than I do worrying about if it was bred in a good way. I just want it to have a good and happy life. 

But I guess there are spoiled and picky people who only want dogs for their personal desires or needs, or to show them off to people, rather than actually caring about the dog. So that makes sense why breeders exist. ";1;1;False;LetheArdor;drh5t02;Sold some bitcoin to buy my new best bud 🤗;7kqq1j;https://i.redd.it/16bgn309ys401.jpg

"ALL breeders, ""good"" by your standards or not, have a conflict of interest....this in the big picture, is a massive issue. People being responsible with and caring for their animals (i.e., spaying/neutering, properly training, etc) is of course the ultimate goal, but saying that people *who are in the business* of making more dogs are not responsible *for there being more dogs in the world* is plain old bullshit, and completely illogical.

Should people spay and neuter? Yes, I believe so. Does the fact that some don't absolve people *who are in the business* of making more dogs for their role in *putting more dogs in the world*? Of course not. 

> ""Happened naturally"" rofl. You mean when some idiot doesn't spay or neuter their pet, and pet gets out and breeds or is bred with other dogs from idiot owners

No, I mean when dogs fuck based on their instincts, not on some idiot deciding he knows better than nature and in one way or another forces them to fuck....trying to shift focus onto another group is what you are doing here.  

>any breed of dog that generally isn't easy to train
based on what? Heresay? The word of someone with a conflict of interests (like some nbreeder who is in denial wrt their own motives, drives, and desires?) If you have data, please present it. Raw data, please, btw. Not something pre-spun b the AKC, et al.

> that dog is going to be harder to train that a purebred lab
Says who? You? You have done this exact experiment? You state this as though its even possible to truly test this hypothesis, or as though you have...it's not, and you have not, not in any meaningful true A/B double blind study kinda way.....because it is not possible to do so, due to (as one example) the impossibility of finding **objective** ""Harder to train"" ""Easier to train"" data in the first place. 

>Also, we know that there is a much higher failure rate for service dogs who come from shelters. 
please provide references for this assertion. I do not believe this, based on over 40 years as a dog trainer, 15 of them professionally.

In my experience, ""pure bred"" dogs are harder to train.  I have theories as to why, but I am not going to speculate. That has been my experience. It is real world experience gained over a long time.  

>It is an upgrade when the breeder tests for known physical conditions within the breed, and gets a good result acceptable by the AKC

One can only definitively say it's an upgrade if one knows all factors involved between the (assumedly 2) things being compared. There is no way to control for all the variables between human intervened animal breeding and naturally occurring breeding. There are too many unknowns.

re the AKC The very existence of the organization itself causes an irreparable conflict of interest wrt their trustworthiness as a source of info....not saying everything they say is bullshit, buuuuuut...

Conflicts of interest are a motherfucker, btw....the ""bias blind spot"" seems to be a common thing, in my experience, although cognitive bias in general is clearly at play, based on the evidence (should you be interested in ridding yourself of cognitive biases, I strongly encourage learning about them...although it's a bit painful discovering ones own faults in this way, it's worth it, imo. It's the only way I know of to rid oneself of these habits). An example of a bias that could blindside someone were if (hypothetically, of course) you were a breeder, or (hypothetically, of course) had bought dogs from breeders before, you would be cognitively inclined to see the good in that, and not the bad. It takes a lot of effort to see past these things.

"if you get a high energy dog and you aren't capable of providing it a proper amount of exercise due to your own physical limitations or time limitations, you're doing the dog a disservice

ie: some dont adopts a dog that turns out to be half working line malinois. the dog takes after the malinois more than the other breed in its mix. the dog is a nightmare for the average owner to handle. the dog lives a poor life because it just isn't the type of dog a normal person can provide enough mental/physical stimulation for, resulting in stress for the dog. 

it is not solely ""this is what i want""

you're reducing the likelihood of later behaviorial problems, stress and negative emotions for the dog, and possibility of abandonment by choosing a dog that will actually suit your life

choosing a dog that is probably not going to murder your pet rabbit or your flock of goats is not just ""this is convenient for me"" but a very important aspect 

choosing a dog that isn't predisposed to human aggression is significant if you live a life where the dog needs to handle a LOT of people

choosing a dog that is not going to chase your small child is also significant (heelers are notorious for this problem due to their ingrained behaviors cultivating a HIGH prey drive that focuses on bite drive unlike a border collie, which has the high chase/prey drive but little to no bite drive); people abandon dogs all the time because they keep harming their child. this isn't just ""wah, convenient for me"" 

choosing a dog that is not going to get to 120lbs when you're a 5'0"" petite 55 year old lady is important; you won't be able to handle a dog of this size in an ""oh shit"" situation and may contribute to the death of the dog or, in the case of a BIG aggressive breed like a cane corso, the death of someone else's dog

choosing a dog that is within your apartments breed/size restrictions is important; you may later be forced to give up the dog (resulting in stress for the dog) if it ends up growing over the size limit or is labelled as a non-acceptable breed by your landlord

"Uhh no dude. I was commenting on how you said most dogs were shut down and act the opposite once home when really it's the opposite of what you are saying so I'm making a direct comment on your specific statement. If anything, they act calmer as you said in your reply which is usually a good thing but that's not what you originally said and made adopting a dog sound worse. Most dogs are not shut down as you mentioned. A lot (but not most) go insane and therefore are euthanized but still available for adoption until then. Most are actually ok and stable. And dare I say, act like how you would expect a dog to act at home. But they can be in the shelter for months and it will get to them.

It's pretty simple to tell a dog that is shutting down from a low energy dog. I've adopted three dogs from the shelter myself and the foundation of who they are is the same as it was in the shelter. One was aggressive from the second I met him (really that dog is a lot of work and was in the shelter for I would say at least 5 months), another was literally shutting down and would not eat, move, do anything but that's just his behavior to begin with. He was only there for about 4 days and was slated to be euthanized the next day before I got him. He's alright now and really a sweet dog but if not at home will revert back to that. The last I got was social and calm in the shelter. She still is.

I have also worked with a lot of shelter dogs. I've volunteered at my local shelter, go there just to visit with animals, worked directly with animal control, and worked with people surrendering their pets due to illnesses that go directly to shelters.

"it is not all around better to get a dog from a shelter. i already illustrated multiple points of why getting a dog from a good breeder is a GOOD option.

shelters are an unfortunate byproduct. they are not the ideal. the ideal is getting dogs from ""dog people"" who know their stuff, and create a good dog for other people. many breeders can place the correct puppy with the family based on temperament. 

not everyone wants to go to a ""shelter"" and get a pitbull mix or a chihuahua mix or a mystery puppy that might grow to 120lbs. not everyone wants to get a mystery mix that later grows up and gets labelled as a bully mix that they can't keep because of rental restrictions on breed. they may also not want to get a mystery mix that turns out to be part cattle dog that chases and nips children, or part husky that will possibly kill their cat one day, or part terrier whos energy level will be more than the family is actually able to accommodate. 

specific breeds ""sometimes"" require special care means nothing. you can avoid those specific breeds. you might end up with a mystery mutt that has them in them. there's no guarantee a ""shelter mutt"" will be any healthier based on ""muh hybrid vigor"". 

>And on top of all this, pure bred dogs are the worst. Why spend all that extra time and money on a shitty dog? Because it looks cute?

i already illustrated why. let me repeat: because breeds have been selectively bred to emphasize certain traits and extinguish others. if you want a low energy dog, you can select a low energy breed. if you want a high energy dog, you can select a high energy breed. if you want an intensely trainable dog, you can get a working line of that breed. if you have small animals or livestock, you can avoid a breed that has a high predisposition to chase and kill. if you want a dog to guard, you can get a dog from a guardian subtype. if you want a dog that's friendly to everyone, you can get a dog that has no guarding instinct. breeds exist for this reason. an old lady probably doesn't want her labrador to turn out to be a cane corso mix. 

""a buddy for life"" could easily become a highly stressful dog you resent, because you got a mutt thats a breed mix incompatible to your lifestyle. ";1;1;False;oiq011110;drh5cil;Sold some bitcoin to buy my new best bud 🤗;7kqq1j;https://i.redd.it/16bgn309ys401.jpg

"> in terms of temperament 

where do you even get this

there's nothing to back that up at all

the only reason the ""mutts are genetically healthier"" thing exists is because mutts with diversified genetics may be less likely to carry the multiple copies needed to activate certain disorders, while if you're breeding within a breed that carries it, you run the risk of the dog inheriting the multiple copies required to activate said genetic health issue 

however; they can also inherit multiple copies of genes from a variety of breeds mixed into them and ALSO end up with genetic health issues as well -- and you don't even have the fallback of genetic testing on parents or screening the dog regularly throughout its life to catch diseases that dog may be predisposed to before it becomes severe

">No, not really. The bred dog was created on purpose, to fill a market. The rescue dog happened naturally.  Buying bred animals perpetuates and fuels the breeding of more dogs.

""Happened naturally"" rofl. You mean when some idiot doesn't spay or neuter their pet, and pet gets out and breeds or is bred with other dogs from idiot owners? I guess it's okay because it happened naturally.

>Generally speaking, mixed breed dogs are genetically superior to dogs whose natural selection has become completely guided by the hand of humans.  As a result, mixed breed dogs, generally speaking are easier to train, and have less health problems.

If you have a lab mixed with any breed of dog that generally isn't easy to train, that dog is going to be harder to train that a purebred lab. I could see the argument for labs mixed with poodles or GSDs or golden retrievers, because those dogs are also bred to be easy to train, but your thought process doesn't make any sense. Mutts are genetically superior when it comes to physical health issues, but not when it comes to the background of the dog. A lot of shelter dogs have been abused. An abused dog does not generally do well as a service dog, a K9 dog, a therapy dog, etc. There is value in knowing where your dog came from that you can't get from a shelter.

>You of course would want to choose a dog that naturally has the inclinations you are looking for, but assuming that the stated intent of breeders is both a)n their actual intent and b) successfully achieving the intent (in this case, specific traits) makes no sense. ..as an analogy...going from an older operatingh system on your computer to a newer one, is not always an ""upgrade"" regardless of the version number. Similarly, a ""pure""bred dog is not automatically better at *anything* than a well chosen rescue dog. 

It is an upgrade when the breeder tests for known physical conditions within the breed, and gets a good result acceptable by the AKC. Labrador retriever breeders often test their hips and eyes, for example, because hip dysplasia and eye disease are something they are susceptible to. A good breeder will not breed a stud and bitch together if they don't have good results from these tests, because then the puppies would also be at risk for those issues. A good breeder will keep up the appropriate health standards for their chosen breed if not try to improve it.

Also, we know that there is a much higher failure rate for service dogs who come from shelters. There is a reason K9 units also don't get their dogs from shelters.

Oh? Well, then, it seems like Murrumiau qualifies:

>I, rescue special needs and senior ones :)

>true, it takes some IQ to do so

Jerking themselves off because they think that they are so fucking brilliant and smug for rescuing special needs and senior animals and since they do it that way, then everyone that acquires a pet needs to adopt too.

"baseline person with no special needs still has a lifestyle and time limit. the amount of physical activity they can provide the dog will vary between all people. the amount of time they can dedicate will ary among all people. this is not an obscure specific niche situation; each person is capable of their own limits only. 

all people are also going to then also have slightly more specific situations to consider like their current living situation, children, other animals in the home, level of experience with dogs/training, etc. you can't NOT consider any aspect of your lifestyle; there is no ""blank slate human in search of dog"". 
you are arguing any dog is suitable for any person barring a ""minority special needs case"", but this is not true. this is what leads to dogs being surrendered or put to sleep (or even abused); they just aren't compatible with the home they are placed into. 

pugs are bred for aesthetics primarily (there's multiple breeds that were never bred for any ""purpose""). this is about genetic behaviors and temperament to suit the family, not appearance. i don't agree with breeding *purely* for physical appearance that does not relate to the task the dog needs to do.

"The fuck kind of drugs are you on?

All of the situations you described are specific situations. Take the base line of a person who is just a person with no special needs, no extras to consider. 

Having a cat is something to consider. Having children is something consider. Those are specific situations. Not everyone is born with children. Not everyone is born owning their own cat. So that makes those circumstances specific to their own lives. 

And I think what you're arguing gets deeper into each individual persons ability to actually own a dog, which is quite a different topic. And maybe that's my fault. I'm more against the ludicrous business of pure-bred dogs. Some are decent but most are just mankinds attempt to alter a species to our own preferences, regardless of the impact on that species health or wellbeing. 

So many breeds of dogs have health problems, because of the specific ways that we bred them, and why did we breed them that way? Because it was appealing. Even though it was damaging to the dogs, so I kind of can't get behind people who still do the same thing. 

Especially pugs. Have you heard them breathe? That shit ain't normal and I bet it sucks. ";1;1;False;LetheArdor;drh8hsp;Sold some bitcoin to buy my new best bud 🤗;7kqq1j;https://i.redd.it/16bgn309ys401.jpg

"they're not specific to people in certain situations. 

if someone has a cat, as many people do, they probably should avoid breeds that are predisposed to killing small animals. 

many people have children and DONT want a dog that is predisposed to chasing and harmign their children. 

these are two REALLY COMMON examples and a lot of ""we have to get rid of this dog because its hurting our children or stalking our cat, to the rescue you go!"" could be avoided. 

someone who just ISNT an active person isn't going to fulfill a super high energy breed like most malinois, huskies, terriers, etc. and the dog is going to suffer. this isn't a ""specific scenario""; this is a very, very common one. the energy level of a specific dog is one of the most important things to consider. how much time can you actually dedicate to stimulation for the dog? if you can't meet that, or it's just not your own personality, then you do the dog a disservice. people and dogs would both have a lot better time if they matched their own energy levels to that of the dog they get. behavioral issues are so commonly linked to a bored dog that has insufficient mental/physical outlet. behavioral issues get dogs surrendered and potentially put down. behavioral issues make people get frustrated and hit the dog. 

the ""normal person"" who just wants a dog is the same person i'm talking about. ""normal people"" have to consider their own ability to provide mental and physical exercise, if they have children, if they live in an apartment where size or barking is a concern, if they have small animals, if they have other pets of any kind, if they are elderly, if they are small/weak, if they are experienced enough in training a dog to handle a dog that NEEDS someone who understands more, etc. these are very much ""normal people"" things. 

>of a perhaps abused dog 

""normal person"" is generally not equip to deal with an abuse case if they don't have significant experience with dogs or training. especially if the abuse case has created aggression, *especially* if it's human-aggression. you do the dog a disservice to fulfill your own ""i did a good"" ego by getting the dog that needs someone more capable than you. 

most people who say ""my dog was abused"" don't actually have an abused dog though. they have an undersocialized dog that is, as unsocialized and feral animals are, wary of humans due to being unfamiliar with them. time spent in a shelter environment can also worsen anxiety and behavior issues, producing a very frightened dog that's never been hit in any way.

"Ok I understand all of your points, but all of your points are all very specific to people in certain situations. In which case, yeah it will take more than just finding a random dog at a shelter. 

I'm talking about the people who just randomly decide to get a dog or have decided to get one, and have the means to get one, no matter what, and instead choose the breeder route. 

Unless you have special living conditions or special reasons for a specific breed is the whole reason for my argument. I meant it to be pretty much a generalization but you've turned it into some pretty specific stuff. 

If you are so determined or require a dog that only special breeds then yeah go to a breeder. 

But if one day you just decide ""I want a dog"" or something like that, those are the people I am talking too. If you want a dog, can get a dog, you should probably think about and make sure you are responsible and mature enough to handle one, but if so, most shelter dogs are perfect for this. 

And that's all I have been talking about is to the general population who just wants a dog. If you are a normal person and just want a dog, why not go save a life of a perhaps abused dog or something like that, instead of buying an expensive puppy unless you specifically wanted that breed for reasons?

Cause I have seen too many people do that. Spend thousands on a dog, when they essentially didn't even give a shit about the breed other than they thought it would be cool and so they could brag about it. And then I get told that people love my dog so much and more, when I got him for $50, and he was previously abused. He was shy and timid at first, but once used to the love and care, he has been the best dog I've ever had. 

I just don't get why someone who doesn't have special needs or anything like that, will drop $2000 on a dog who has been spoiled and will be spoiled the rest of its life, while perfect dogs who are abused and neglected spend their lives or get put down in shelters.

"Bad rep for contributing to asshole people abandoning dogs when they get bored or overwhelmed. That's also been my experience with the breeder I do know in the city I live in. They're just fucking dumb as shit people who keep breeding pits and this other kind of dog, like a yorkie or something. Like, they had a small yard, too many dogs, couldn't get rid of them soon enough, ended up euthanizing some of the puppies and couldn't afford to treat simple illnesses like a respiratory infection. They're disgusting humans and they keep doing the. same. damn. thing. Over and over, because people keep giving them money. 

So that's why I personally hate them, but there was one breeder out in the country who treated their dogs really well that I met. But then they gave one of the dogs to a woman who immediately euthanized the pup because he was too much to care for (he had a bum back), so they inadvertently contributed to that shitty situation too (which I don't fuuullllllly fault them for). 

Adoption is better than contributing to those situations imo, even though you still run the risk of people treating the animals poorly, at least you're not further adding/paying to raise (or breed) the likelihood of something terrible happening, like inhumane treatment. And you're giving a loving creature a new home when it would otherwise DIE. ";5;0;False;jfcsuperstar;drgqbu9;Sold some bitcoin to buy my new best bud 🤗;7kqq1j;https://i.redd.it/16bgn309ys401.jpg

Shelters and rescues are two totally different things. Shelters are literally just shelters where they try (often not very hard) to do little more than keep the dogs alive. Rescues are different. Rescues will typically foster the dogs, test their temperament with people, dogs, cats, etc – and will often treat medical and emotional issues. So while a $25 or $100 adoption fee might be typical of a shelter, rescues will typically ask for a $200–400 fee.;4;0;False;drinkonlyscotch;drgxqic;Sold some bitcoin to buy my new best bud 🤗;7kqq1j;https://i.redd.it/16bgn309ys401.jpg

"That's not the reasoning I'm using here. I'll try to clarify:

Let's say you've committed to buying one dog and you're choosing between adopting a shelter dog or getting one from a breeder. There's going to be a population of dogs without a home regardless of which choice you go with. But only one of these options reduces the overall population of homeless dogs by reducing the demand for puppy mill / breeder dogs and consequently the number of them being bred.

On aggregate, the number of dogs being bred commercially will adjust to changes in demand. It may not seem like your choice to adopt has a tangible impact, which is a doubt that applies to a lot of our consumer choices. We tend to distrust that our contribution to a statistical effect is real or representative of our actual contribution, because the chain of causation is obscured and we aren't directly experiencing the payoff.

One way to intuitively understand this is to consider the consequences of 1000 people in your city choosing to adopt instead of buying from a breeder. The specific consequences for individual breeders will be that they reduce their production by x amount (because each unsold dog costs them money). Some might over-adjust and some might under-adjust. Some might go out of business. Zooming out to a wider perspective, the net effect once the market adjusts as a whole is that production will be reduced corresponding to the change in demand. So in this case, 1000 fewer dogs are bred, give or take. If you were one of those people who adopted, you contributed 1/1000th of that effect, or one doggo.

It's the same principle with any choice we face when participating in markets as consumers. The difference we personally make is represented by a fraction of the total effect on changes in market demand. The fraction we are responsible for ends up being essentially equivalent to the change we personally made, whether it's one doggo, one fewer meat meal a week, one more voice at a protest. At a micro level it's not always a perfectly neat correlation, because statistical effects have high variance with small sample sizes. But the sum of your choices over the course of your life -- or the fraction of one choice as part of the sum of everyone else making the same choice -- statistically converges towards change that's directly proportional to your contribution.

There's also the flow-on effects of people who are influenced when they see you making good choices. Which is harder to quantify, but still real and significant.";2;0;False;gibs;drgvenu;Sold some bitcoin to buy my new best bud 🤗;7kqq1j;https://i.redd.it/16bgn309ys401.jpg

Adopting a child when you're capable of having kids is a pretty amazing thing to do though, right? It's essentially making a personal sacrifice for the larger good.

There are breed specific rescues. Idk about this breed in the OP, seems pretty unusual. But I'd imagine there's one for huskies. Our family got our border collie from a border collie specific rescue about 6 years ago this month. She's wonderful and healthy. She was taken into the rescue as a puppy when she was found wandering the streets of some city in Tennessee before she wound up with us in Pennsylvania. Always wonder what her back story is ... ;7;1;False;caterpillarmoustache;drguc3e;Sold some bitcoin to buy my new best bud 🤗;7kqq1j;https://i.redd.it/16bgn309ys401.jpg

"When my girlfriend was looking for a dog she wasn't working but I was. She was trying to rescue a dog but shelters would ask things like, ""Do you work?"" No, she didn't. Then they'd ask how she'd care for the dog. She said I would pay for things it needs until she got a job if she ever did again (Her and I are serious and I make enough to support us and a dog). Then they asked what would happen if we broke up? I forget what she said but they ultimately decided not to let us rescue one of their dogs.

So then she contacts another rescue, she gets the same questions. Her and I both are well aware of the responsibilities of owning a dog. We both know we're more than capable in all aspects. So this time she just tells them she has a job and can support a dog. This time they ask, ""Well, who's going to take care of the dog when you're at work?""

It went around like this with every rescue she contacted. Probably ten or twelve. I'm sure not ALL rescues are like this but I'm pretty convinced most rescues don't actually want to rehome their dogs. I think they get attached to them and just want to keep them while searching for the absolute perfect home that they know doesn't exist.

"no one is obligated to save a dog

people could adopt children instead of having them themselves, but more often than not, they don't. you could tell them the very same thing you're saying right now.

people could put all of their money into charities and live an extremely modest life, but they don't. you don't yell this same spiel at people for choosing to buy an xbox instead of donate to charity. you don't yell at a person for going out to eat instead of cooking a modest meal and donating food to the hungry. you don't yell at people sending their children to private schools and not donating to educate the poor. you don't yell at people buying produce farmed on cheap slave labor. you don't yell at people buying cheap good produced in chinese sweat shops. 

the aspect of money is also irrelevant. if someone has money to invest in a dog, this means nothing towards the quality of life the dog can be expected to have (save, maybe, the owner considering it more valuable and probably having the money to put into vet care later since they can afford the large price now). you don't yell at people who buy a luxury item because ""wow don't you spend your money on things i disapprove of"". the investment also goes towards a good breeder properly handling and socializing the puppies and raising them in a home environment (as opposed to a stray, a kennel, etc.) during the very critical window, care for the bitch during pregnancy, testing for genetic/health problems, etc. 

you single out only dogs. 



you've probably gone to more generic shelters/pounds. breed specific rescues are renowned for being very invasive and choosey about the people they place the dogs with, to the point of many people accusing the rescue's members of ""hoarding"" dogs. there is at least one labrador rescue i know of that won't place a dog with a family unless there is a retired person home who does not work, to be home with the dog 24/7. a family with kids? they won't let you have the lab. 

many of them also won't let you adopt a dog if you live in an apartment or don't have a fenced yard. ";2;1;False;oiq011110;drh41ph;Sold some bitcoin to buy my new best bud 🤗;7kqq1j;https://i.redd.it/16bgn309ys401.jpg
"Really? Because a lot of dogs in shelters literally go crazy in that environment and act out. But once in a warm and stable environment, they are very calm and easy going.

Shelters cause issues for dogs and that's why shelters euthanize even if space is available; animal shelters care about quality of life as well and a dog that's acting out or is shutting down, they will euthanize. That's why placing pets in foster care is a lot better for the mentality of dogs.

"this is true, but if you're getting a dog from a reputable breeder, not a pet store, where the puppies have been handled and raised well it (usually; there are exceptions like genetic problems) makes a HUGE difference

there is a window of being highly impressionable (""socialization window"" or ""learning window"") up to until about 14-16 weeks. most puppy owners don't get the dog until minimum 8 weeks, more commonly 12. 

if the puppy has spent the majority of its life confined to a kennel, as a stray, under a porch, etc. with little human handling and little exposure to stimulus (ie: handling their paws, vacuums, bathing, other animals) you are without a doubt more likely to have a harder time with the puppy than if the puppy had been very well handled and socialized by the breeder during this stage.

"> I honestly don’t understand the sentiment here. 

The sentiment is this:

whatever a system incentivizes (actually the word is ""incents"", but that one gets misinterpreted a lot) ...whatever a system incents, will tend to happen more and more over time. This is a universal truth. No amount of ""If we keep the system and just try harder"" or ""keep the system and get rid of *this* group"" will stop whatever a system incents from manifesting more and more over time.

The system of breeding animals and selling them incents people to make short cuts, and lie to themselves and others and ignore/deny the obvious fact that humans intervening in the normal mating process of animals with the intent of creating more ""better"" animals results in more ""throw away"" animals.



The problem is that there are more dogs than there are homes.

"> I have never understood this logic. Can't you apply the same logic to adopting? Adopting a dog takes away a home from a bred dog as well.

No, not really. The bred dog was created on purpose, to fill a market. The rescue dog happened naturally.  Buying bred animals perpetuates and fuels the breeding of more dogs.


> You are more likely to get a good hunting dog out of a well-bred Labrador retriever than a mutt you find in the shelter.

No, that's not true.

Generally speaking, mixed breed dogs are genetically superior to dogs whose natural selection has become completely guided by the hand of humans.  As a result, mixed breed dogs, generally speaking are easier to train, and have less health problems.

You of course would want to choose a dog that naturally has the inclinations you are looking for, but assuming that the stated intent of breeders is both a)n their actual intent and b) successfully achieving the intent (in this case, specific traits) makes no sense. ..as an analogy...going from an older operatingh system on your computer to a newer one, is not always an ""upgrade"" regardless of the version number. Similarly, a ""pure""bred dog is not automatically better at *anything* than a well chosen rescue dog. 

>Responsible breeders are not at fault for the thousands of dogs that are euthanized every year.

I stand by my original statement. There is no such thing as a responsible breeder.

I have never understood this logic. Can't you apply the same logic to adopting? Adopting a dog takes away a home from a bred dog as well.

>Every breeder that breeds dogs should have to go work at the high kill shelters and euthanize 1 dog for every one they bring into the world. Then at least they have to work harder to live in their denial about how they contribute to the mass killing of dogs.

Uh, no. Responsible breeders generally breed for a purpose, including their dogs being used as service dogs, hunting dogs, therapy dogs, K9 units, etc. These dogs are called dogs with a job, and they are bred in order to be able to do that job as best as possible. You are more likely to get a good hunting dog out of a well-bred Labrador retriever than a mutt you find in the shelter. You are more likely to have a service dog in training become a full fledged service dog with a golden retriever coming from a good breeder than one found at the shelter, not to mention the dog will be able to work longer. A good breeder also breeds for the health of the breed. They want the breed they focus on to be as healthy as possible. Their pups are usually spoken for before the puppies are even born, and if a puppy isn't bought, they will take care of that puppy until it finds a home. If it never does, the dog will stay with the breeder forever.

Responsible breeders are not at fault for the thousands of dogs that are euthanized every year.

"They're not identical because for traditional currency, it's not the currency that behaves that way, it depends on what you do with it. 

You used the example of an IRA - that's a legal structure with restrictions, etc. You don't get the benefit of an IRA just by hodling dollars. Putting your dollars in an IRA means you're no longer just hodling, they're being invested, typically by someone who controls those dollars on your behalf.

If you're just hodling dollars, there's no incentive to keep them unspent or uninvested. In fact, inflation creates a disincentive to do that. If you're not going to spend it, then the decision making favors investing in something that generates value, possibly loan it out, etc. If you give it to an investment manager, they'll do that stuff for you.

From the investor's perspective, you could ignore some of these distinctions and treat investing inflationary fiat as being similar to holding Bitcoin in terms of potential asset growth. But that's part of the problem: if the individual decision making favors just hodling currency, that's bad for the economy: you're not spending, and not investing. Aside from the bad effects of that, this hoarding of the currency drives its value up without a corresponding increase in the underlying economy, leading to a currency bubble.

Once we caught her sleeping with a loaf of bread for some reason. There was a mesh net of vine-ripening tomatoes, she pulled them out through the mesh, hid them all over the house, and left the vine. She'd get spooked and bark at the weirdest things.

"I don't yell at people who spend thousands of dollars on a dog vs. getting one from a shelter. I was just saying I agree and that, it's all around better to get a dog from a shelter. 

And I mean a shelter, not some breed specific rescue or whatever. Animal shelter is all I was speaking on. Those are wayyyyy different than what you are talking about. Perhaps some areas I don't have them but everywhere I have lived has an animal shelter. Not speaking about specially rescues or whatever. 

Also having/adopting a child and adopting a dog, are completely different things so that was kind of a pointless comparison. 

And yeah the money thing is pretty relevant. You're spending thousands more dollars on a dog who is not only going to live shorter than a mutt or mixed breed you find at a shelter, but the dog will more than likely cost more in the long run as specific breeds sometimes require special care. 

And on top of all this, pure bred dogs are the worst. Why spend all that extra time and money on a shitty dog? Because it looks cute? 

We have fucked up a lot of dogs through breeding for our own personal interests, and its kinda fucked up in my opinion. And in my opinion, people are idiots for spending thousands on a dog when you can get a buddy for life who probably who could use it, rather than an expensive ass puppy with health issues. 

But I'm not yelling at people. I just agree that if you care and love for dogs, your time and money are better spent getting a shelter dog. ";1;1;False;LetheArdor;drh4ri8;Sold some bitcoin to buy my new best bud 🤗;7kqq1j;https://i.redd.it/16bgn309ys401.jpg

"> I just got lucky and happened to find what I wanted at a shelter.

But that's exactly the kind of sentiment that damages dogs at shelters everywhere.  Most people won't look, because they see comments like this that reinforce the belief that shelters are nothing but pit bulls (which are awesome too btw).  It's just plain not true.  I follow some local shelters on facebook and they are *constantly* posting pictures of border collies, beagles, purebreds, and all sorts of breeds.  Plenty of them <1 year old.  They are not that rare.  Awesome breeds are available all the time, luck does not play that big of a role. Especially if you are patient and willing to wait & check for a month. Don't dissuade people from looking...

We all know that shitty people will adopt a new 'oh so cute' breed, then after a year they get tired of them and drop them off at the shelter, because they aren't willing to actually care for the dog.  Where else do these dogs end up?";-2;0;False;McBurger;drh1ai2;Sold some bitcoin to buy my new best bud 🤗;7kqq1j;https://i.redd.it/16bgn309ys401.jpg
"Hopefully someone is with the dogs at all times.  I understand good breeders transport dogs to expand breeding lines.  And rescues need to transport dogs from where there are too many of certain breeds (like Chihuahuas in California and Hounds in the mid-south) to places they can be adopted.

">Really? Because a lot of dogs in shelters literally go crazy in that environment and act out. But once in a warm and stable environment, they are very calm and easy going.

so what you're saying is its hard to determine appropriate dogs based on the distorted view of the dog you see in the shelter? hmm...

not all of them are shut down. this was an example of getting a dog you expect to be ""calm"" and ""low energy"" who isn't at all that once adjusted. 

you can have the opposite too, but that's less problematic. most people have an easier time managing a lazy dog than a hyper one. 

we had shelter dogs where i used to work and some of them were bouncy and crazy in the kennels, some of them were timid and ""quiet"" but quite happy go-lucky and even hyper later. this environment makes it very hard to select a suitable dog based on limited exposure to temperament in a situation that doesn't mirror home life.

"That is one super cute puppy! Is this your first doggo? A few tips that I'd like to share that I seem to be slacking on or that I've learned over the years.  
  
1. Don't forget the monthly heartworm medicine. Set a reminder on your phone that goes off once a month.  
  
2. If you bought this dog from a store, take it to the vet ASAP. I've seen pet store dogs die one extremely quickly. Be concerned if you hear a weeze/cough or it is extremely lethargic and just wants to lay around instead of being an active puppy.  
  
3. Either watch a bunch of dog training videos on YouTube or sign up for classes at your local Kennel Club! http://www.susangarrett.com/ offers an expensive $500 membership that lets you watch videos online to help train your pups. She's the top doggo trainer in the US, according to my GF.  
  
4. Make sure to take lots of photos. [Like this!](https://i.imgur.com/a0qMDOp.jpg) Or [like this!](https://i.imgur.com/SxTqEml.jpg)  
  
5. www.chewy.com has dog food/snacks/toys/beds/leashes/collars for cheaper than almost every pet store I've ever been in. Look into it. They will ship it right to your front door. Benebones are what my doggos like to chew.  
  
6. My 2nd dog was potty-trained extremely quick, but the first dog... It took that little shit head a year and like 4 months to stop peeing/pooping in the house.  
  
7. Dog Walker apps for your phone. Look into it. It is pretty cool for when you're at work late.";1;0;False;CIA_Linguist;drgw5wy;Sold some bitcoin to buy my new best bud 🤗;7kqq1j;https://i.redd.it/16bgn309ys401.jpg

"Hopefully it wasn't bought from a pet shop supporting a puppy mill and was adopted as that's where nearly all of them come from.
I did work experience in a vet practice for my course and had to visit one of the 'breeders' that supplied to the local pet warehouse, needless to say it was a distressing experience and I will always adopt. Also a number of bigger breeders that sell purebred puppies are still not as good a people make out, I saw a few and they brought their female dogs in every month to get blood tested (big needle in their foreleg) to check if their hormones showed they were fertile. So sad as some of the dogs would try their best to avoid the needles and we would have to hold them in place. It saddens me people think this is ok and worth it because they get a cute status symbol and puppy out it.
 So please always adopt as I met some beautiful purebred and mutt dogs from puppies to elders that had been abandoned and given up (not at fault of their own..their owners moved or went into aged care) and some that had to be put down.

"i've never seen 'free' adoptions.   Every adoption event I've ever seen has a fee attached to it, presumably to keep freeloaders looking for abuse animals at bay.

Perhaps OP mentioned more here, but... just our local pet stores run adoption events seemingly weekly.  You still have to pay some money, then probably want to buy some equipment as well.  ""Buying"" the dog at a pet store could very well have been supporting an adoption through the local animal shelter - that's often how it's done around here.";1;0;False;mgkimsal;drgyppn;Sold some bitcoin to buy my new best bud 🤗;7kqq1j;https://i.redd.it/16bgn309ys401.jpg

"There is one major problem with this. While this might be an ok sentiment for cats and some areas it doesn't apply to all. Every shelter within a two hour drive from my house (I live near a major city) is filled with pit bulls and rotwilers. While that may be fine for some people and I agree that breeds aren't inheriently mean that it comes from the owners i still don't want a pit bull or a rotwiler. Most of the ones in the shelters do have attitude problems. My family spent 2 years of checking the shelter websites weekly before we finally decided to go to a reputable breeder. Any dog that was not a pitbull or a rotwiller was instantly spoken for and we never had a chance to adopt them. 

It was a year or two after that people started to setup breed specific rescues that would transport all over the country. Even then it took a while to see one for the breed we have. ";5;1;False;DocAtDuq;drh577o;Sold some bitcoin to buy my new best bud 🤗;7kqq1j;https://i.redd.it/16bgn309ys401.jpg

"Hi there, I saw you're in Sydney and buying what looks like a cockalier from a pet store so I logged in especially to comment. 

I bought a beautiful cockalier from a petstore in Hurstville earlier this year. I had no idea where pet stores actually get their dogs. Turns out they get them from puppy mills! Look them up, it's a disgusting way of churning out as many expensive puppies as possible in order to make money. They keeps them in tiny cages and breed the mothers non stop. They don't have any space to move around and pee and poo in the area that they also sleep in, which makes for terrible living conditions and also makes it hard to toilet train later on. Puppy mill dogs are much more likely to have congenital health problems as they don't test for them, and are often generally u healthy as the people breeding them don't give a shit and just want to make money. 

When we got our puppy she was severely underweight and could not walk properly, and also had an awful worm infestation. We had to spend hundreds of dollars on vet bills as the vet they had partnered with didn't give a single shit when we took her in for her first check up. She had awful diarrhoea for the first few weeks and it took her that long to perk up and become healthy again. 

They should not have sold us that dog full stop - anyone with any knowledge about dogs would have known she was desperately sick and needed urgent medical attention. It honestly makes me sick looking back on it. They even talked us into buying $1000 worth of extra toys and accessories that we did not need, could have got it from Kmart for literally a tenth of that. 

I'm not saying that you shouldn't get her, my puppy has brought so much into my life. I just want to share my story so that other people don't have to go through what we did! 

If you want to talk more about it please feel free to pm me! :)

"Bitcoin is already dead. It doesn’t deliver on a single promise.

Send money anonymously? FBI already proved it’s not truly anonymous.

Send money with low fees? Transaction fees are already climbing beyond $25/transaction, and when all bitcoins are mined the only remaining incentive for mining (and therefore validating the public ledger) is transaction fees. So they’ll have to climb to higher fees.

Not to mention bitcoin just purely doesn’t scale. A week ago when the price of bitcoin was making 20-30% swings in one day, transactions were taking over 6 hours to complete because of how backed up the public ledger became. Validating the public ledger is far too arduous and manual to scale.

2. Avoid groupthink. People tend to invest in dogs closer to christmas (clothing, etc) and summer (vacations) and then make their dogs work for them closer to new year (resolutions, running etc). Do not follow the crowd, but use your own intuition.
3. Only put into the dog what you are prepared to lose.
4. Get an offline kennel and *never*, I repeat, **never** give the dog to anyone. That is like handing the keys to your house to a stranger.
5. Digging for food is not very profitable these days, most of the shovel pools are now in China. Just buy them off a reputed exchange like [Caninebase.com](http://dogecoin.com/)
6. Last but not the least, never trust any links from any one.

"Pretty dissapointing to see people still purchasing dogs from pet stores rather than adopting a loving, grateful rescue from any one of a thousand dog pounds in every country.

Every year thousands of dogs get out out of their misery because the shelters cannot find owners, while vain twenty-somethings buy pure breeds from shops who outsource to mills just so they can see its formative puppy years.

I get it, you’re a cute chick with a cute dog, but you may as well be buying heroin to spike into your arm because your impacting society in just as negative a way imo. ";1;1;False;great-nba-comment;drgze4h;Sold some bitcoin to buy my new best bud 🤗;7kqq1j;https://i.redd.it/16bgn309ys401.jpg

"Please don't buy from pet stores!
Let me fill you in on a **life hack-**

If you're set on getting a specific breed and a puppy, there is nothing wrong with that. 

Go to AKC website. (I forgot if it's .com or .org) and scroll down to *find a puppy*. You type in your zip and how many miles you are willing to travel 

the website will give you a list of reputable breeders that have litters of pups to choose from and they are hand-raised in a home environment. The dogs are healthy because AKC doesn't advertise for shitty breeders.

And they have a genetic health guarantee!

And they are thousands of dollars less than a pet store!!!
(because the pet store had to buy the puppy and pay the puppy broker and then make a profit selling the puppy so the pet store basically doubled the dog's price).

I have suffered the heart break of buying a dog from a shitty backyard breeder. Never again. Please support responsible Kennel Club breeders or adopt.

People want specific breeds, at a specific age, with specific temperaments.

"Not sure what you mean by 'assuming a Bitcoin world'.  I believe that today we live as much in a Bitcoin world as in a Gold or Dollar world.

That having said, increasing Bitcoin prices is not necessarilly what is going to happen. Yes, the number of Bitcoins is finite and will gradually decline, but that does not necessarilly mean that the price of BTC has to go up. The price of BTC is driven by the value people assign to it. There is no underlying intrinsic value. Although the fact that the number of coins will decrease over time may increasing the likelihood of prices rising with time, this is by no means certain.

The value of gold owned by central Banks is less than 1.5 Trillion USD. It is difficult to say at what point trust in the global economic system will collapse. But as soon as BTCs market cap increases beyond the value of gold owned by central Banks across the globe, I would start to worry. So a BTC price of $100k would -in my view- indeed seem unlikely aswell as worrying. Hierover, In would feel that a collapse of BTC prices is more like than a collapse of these global economic system. So..., if you'd ask me a significant price increase of BTC is still very well possible, but the most upbeat scenario should assume a price limit of less than $100k (in the next 5 years).;1;0;False;mutua_fides;drh2zby;Don't invest recklessly;7gi55s;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7gi55s/dont_invest_recklessly/

"We were dividing by 0, not 2. Still...

if you divide 4 monkeys in half it is still possible to just have 2 sets of monkeys just separated by space. They're still alive. Doing the math the regular way is quite mean. Finding the answer depends on which axis you cut the monkeys on. If you divide the monkeys horizontally then you have eight 1/2 size monkey pieces. If you divide them vertically then you have 4 living monkeys. That is unless the monkeys are all standing on each other. This is the difference between lateral thinking and linear/vertical thinking. You're under the assumption that there is only one valid answer. There are multitudes of answers to the question because it depends on the constraints of the thought experiment.

https://imgur.com/a/kxjKW

If you divide 1 monkey by 2 then you have 1 monkey cut in half. You can cut it either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Or you could cut it in an evenly distributed wave algorithm. Or unevenly if that floats your boat.

The word divide has di as a prefix meaning 2. Meaning made into 2. If you cut a monkey 1 time you have 2 pieces. If cut evenly then the monkey's pieces would be of 50% size. If you cut a monkey 2 times evenly you have 3 pieces of 33.33% size. That is why I made the comment about polyvision as a term to use instead of division. It would be a more correct term than division. We normally say divide by 2 instead of divide in two. There is a difference. 3/1 in another syntax could be 1.5. Still, it is semantic and irrelevant. As it is, we do just fine the regular way.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRRolKTlF6Q

Watch this video. See, how they explain how 20/0 would go on forever and thus is undefined. The problem is 3=3 is forever as well.
**It's a matter of semantics and process.** 0 is not a regular number. It really doesn't matter how you approach it. The question is do you want to approach it with consistency or not? They even have a discussion as to whether or not the calculator is just rote made to spit out error or undefined.

You might have a problem with reading comprehension: I said ""Operating in the standard way is more a matter of practicality. You really wouldn't want to follow through with the other way. Maintaining consistency would be weird in ways I don't want to get into. **It is only useful in this one case.** Practicality is the same reason why as soon as people could they dropped Roman style math. I just ask people to try to think outside their box."" **As in if you want to be consistent with 20/0 = 20 then 4/2 = 4. It's only correct if you remain consistent.**

English is my first language. I grew up in the United States. I am 33 years old. I attended k-12, and 6 years of college. 2 Community. 4 at a university. I have 3 degrees. I was always in advanced English classes. Though, excuse my redditese: I have to type in a small box. My two years in community were for an associates of applied science in computer graphics. Meaning my studies were on a lot of geometry and math. With any 2 year degree there are required literature classes and foreign language classes. I've written a book. My other 4 years of school were in studio art and art history. The degree however is just a bachelors of art in art, instead of a bachelors of fine art. Meaning it is more of a general degree then an art degree. I am more of an expert of the art of art than actual art. **Though, a good part of my training was learning to think in unconventional ways.** I taught myself to program in 7th grade on an IBM ps/2 model 30. I know Basic, Visual Basic, Java, and C#. In that order. Throughout high school and college I took various language classes. I studied German and Spanish. Later on I found duolingo and have studied other languages. If you ever want to discuss Emily Dickinson, or talk about adjective declension in German I might know a thing or two.

There is a big problem with 0 and applying regular systematic math to it. When you apply problems involving zero and apply them to real world situations you find there are actually ways of solving the problem. Say for instance 0/20. Now you would might say this can't be done. Well it can be. Your calculator doesn't yell out undefined here. If I take a crate filled with nothing and I divide the crate into 20 pieces, there are 20 pieces of nothing in the crate. It could be notated as 00000000000000000000 or just 0.  You have to make the same **leap** of logic here in this case. If you can't divide by 0 then why can you divide 0? There was nothing to divide. The math world makes the leap here, but not there. There is an inconstancy. The only reason to argue against the practice is a strict adherence to conventions and dogmatic orthodoxy.

"**Allegory of the Cave**

The Allegory of the Cave, or Plato's Cave, was presented by the Greek philosopher Plato in his work Republic (514a–520a) to compare ""the effect of education (παιδεία) and the lack of it on our nature"". It is written as a dialogue between Plato's brother Glaucon and his mentor Socrates, narrated by the latter. The allegory is presented after the analogy of the sun (508b–509c) and the analogy of the divided line (509d–511e). All three are characterized in relation to dialectic at the end of Books VII and VIII (531d–534e).

**Galileo affair**

The Galileo affair (Italian: il processo a Galileo Galilei) was a sequence of events, beginning around 1610, culminating with the trial and condemnation of Galileo Galilei by the Roman Catholic Inquisition in 1633 for his support of heliocentrism.

In 1610, Galileo published his Sidereus Nuncius (Starry Messenger), describing the surprising observations that he had made with the new telescope, namely the phases of Venus and the Galilean moons of Jupiter. With these observations he promoted the heliocentric theory of Nicolaus Copernicus (published in De revolutionibus orbium coelestium in 1543). Galileo's initial discoveries were met with opposition within the Catholic Church, and in 1616 the Inquisition declared heliocentrism to be formally heretical.

***

**Salon des Refusés**

The Salon des Refusés, French for ""exhibition of rejects"" (French pronunciation: ​[salɔ̃ de ʁəfyze]), is generally an exhibition of works rejected by the jury of the official Paris Salon, but the term is most famously used to refer to the Salon des Refusés of 1863.

Today by extension, salon des refusés refers to any exhibition of works rejected from a juried art show.

**Don Herbert**

Donald Jeffry Herbert (born Donald Herbert Kemske and better known as Mr. Wizard, July 10, 1917 – June 12, 2007) was the creator and host of Watch Mr. Wizard (1951–65, 1971–72) and of Mr. Wizard's World (1983–90), which were educational television programs for children devoted to science and technology.

"""It was the little boy's first day of school. He was very excited and couldn't wait to start learning new things. He was having a lovely day, and after Recess his teacher said, ""Children, now we are going to do some drawing."" Good! Thought the little boy. He loved drawing. He got out his pencils and was about to start drawing out a fantastic story about tigers and dragons, when the teacher said, ""Wait! Today we are going to draw some flowers."" Good! Thought the little boy, he loved flowers, and he began to draw all different sized flowers with beautiful shapes and colours. He drew some of the beautiful flowers his Mum grew in their garden. But then, the teacher said ""Wait! Let me show you how to draw a flower. A good flower has five petals, with a green stem. You can colour the petals red."" Okay, thought the little boy, I can draw a flower like that. So he drew a flower with five red petals and a green stem.

""Well done,"" said the teacher, pleased the little boy's second drawing.

The next day, after Recess, the teacher once again announced that they were going to do some drawing. Good! Thought the little boy, eager to draw something exciting. But before he had a chance to begin, the teacher said, ""Wait! Today, we will draw a house."" Great! Thought the little boy, and he began by drawing the backyard of his house first, with his dog inside the fence. But before he got far, the teacher said, ""Wait! Let me show you how to draw a house. You can use a square for the main part, with a triangle for the roof. The door can be a rectangle and the windows some more squares."" The little boy placed his first attempt in the rubbish bin when he realised it was not what the teacher wanted. He then set to work on a square house with a triangular roof.

When the little boy showed the teacher she said, ""Beautiful work!"" Good! Thought the little boy.   As time went on, months in fact, the little boy realised each day after recess was time for drawing. He learnt to sit quietly and wait for the teacher to tell the class what to draw and how to draw it. The teacher was always very pleased with his work, as he listened very carefully to what she wanted. Then one day, something happened. The little boy's father got a job far away, so the little boy had to leave his school, and go to a new one near his father's new job.

The little boy liked his new school, and his new teacher was very nice. On his first day, the teacher said to the class, ""Please get out some paper, it's time for some drawing."" Good! Thought the little boy, and he sat patiently, waiting to be told what to do next. He waited for a while, then his teacher came up to him and said, ""Johnny, why haven't you started your drawing?"" ""Because you haven't told us what we are going to draw,"" replied the little boy. ""If I told you what to draw,"" said the teacher, ""then everyone's picture would look the same and I wouldn't be able to tell them apart. The room would look fairly boring, don't you think?"" ""Oh,"" said the little boy, with a confused look on his face. Then the teacher said with a smile, ""You can draw whatever you like."" The little boy's face lit up. ""Anything?"" Asked the little boy. ""Anything"", said the teacher. Good! Thought the little boy happily, I can do that!

And he began to draw a flower with five red petals and a green stem.""

Nope. Sorry. The word is self-explanatory. **Anti** = Against, **Semite** = Semitic People. Jews are not Semitic People. Nice try though. Sorry you don't have rudimentary reading comprehension skills.

"Clearly inflation is a systemic incentive to do something more productive with your money than stuff it under your mattress.  If calling that theft gets you nice and hard, well that's your business.  

But I personally find that in any government policy, there will be winners and there will be losers, and the losers will always scream about what money, rights, advantages or whatever is being ""stolen"" from them.  Calling policy theft only shows that you are incapable of truly understanding the complexities of setting policy to improve the greater good.

I personally find 2% inflation is a lot less harmful to me personally than cumulative 50% fed/state/local/sales/school tax rates.

But then I'm more interested in enjoying the fact that I have a functioning economy and a stable society in which I can make a living than I am in whining about how some secret cabal is stealing 2% a year in value from the $500 I have stuffed in my underwear drawer.

"**Balfour Declaration**

The Balfour Declaration was a public statement issued by the British government during World War I announcing support for the establishment of a ""national home for the Jewish people"" in Palestine, then an Ottoman region with a minority Jewish population. It read:



His Majesty's government view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of this object, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country.



The declaration was contained in a letter dated 2 November 1917 from the United Kingdom's Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour to Lord Rothschild, a leader of the British Jewish community, for transmission to the Zionist Federation of Great Britain and Ireland. The text of the declaration was published in the press on 9 November 1917.

Core doesn't view the direction as a design flaw. It's actually the direction they want. If you have a large stack of something would you prefer if people were to hold and not spend theirs which would create a store of value through low supply to meet demand. Or on the flip side, if people were actually spending their savings, additional supply would be available which in a sane world would make the price go down not up. So Core has taken the stance that its better to be a store of value than a functioning currency.

"**Disclaimer: This is a very basic comment so you would be better served to do some more in depth research if you want hard data** At its most basic it comes back to the problem that bitcoin was/is trying to solve. Providing ""A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System""

Have a look at the opening statement to the bitcoin whitepaper. 

""A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online
payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution""(https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) 

Bitcoin core is slow and expensive to use so by very design became a store of value as opposed to a means of exchange. The goal of Bcash was to be fast and cheap to use meaning you could actually use it in a currency function if you so desired. Cash is cheap and easy to use so digital cash would need to be even easier and cheaper to use to make sense. 

The Bitcoin crowd used to use a term that the goal behind bitcoin was to ""Bank the un-banked"" If the cost to use something outweighs its usefulness it will never suit majority of use-cases as things like transaction fee's are a big deal if you don't earn much money. No good using bitcoin if the fee to do so it equal to 20 hours of your labour. There is a lot more to it than that but the minute bitcoin became another tool for the rich was the minute it outlived its usefulness IMO.

Litecoin being the second crypto-currency on a scene has definitely stood the test of time that a lot of newer coins can't say, is by the very design automatically 4 times faster than bitcoinCore, has been stable as far as development for the most part, has never forked its direction (not including the fact that it in itself it basically a fork of the original bitcoin), has already adopted segwit and the lightning network with no issues and will be able to do atomic swaps which means proper decentralized exchanges. 

The list goes on for why i think litecoin is a far better choice than bitcoinCore or Bcash but like anything is life and especially investing do your own research and make up your mind based on your parameters. 

Happy to discuss further as my jumbled thoughts probably don't make sense.

"That’s exactly what I’m talking about my dude.  Who is roasting whom?  (Wrote this first sentence, then reread my post and will continue now.)

That last paragraph, you’re right, so that’d have been my bad. I want to say I meant it as a joke, but I don’t think I did.  Especially the last sentence.  It was bad and took all the meaning out of what I was trying  to say.

I think I was still correct about the fiat thing though, and even though the last paragraph was shitty, it still partially expressed a sentiment that I feel about this sub.  I’m going to continue in an edit, but you were right and I was wrong.

In a lot of ways, this community has “seen the future” in that the blockchain will become widely adopted, but in a lot of other ways, it has fallen into a trap.  When I first started paying attention probably 5 years ago, anyone who would be excited to talk about bitcoin would be able to explain fiat currency and the ways in which btc was different.  I personally don’t own any bitcoin, but I myself spent a lot of time talking about it to people who had no idea.  I couldn’t just say “look btc is 19k$!!!!”  I had to explain the difficultly of breaking encryption and how the money supply works compared to the mechanics of bitcoin, and what that meant for its value, especially to people in countries with more volatile economies or fewer individual protections for personal property.  I have an economics degree, and I had to know my shit.  People from other walks of life had to learn more on their own and work harder.

At this point though, I’m concerned that the lack of understanding is going to lose people their money, which has happened this exact way in things that aren’t bitcoin. To gloss over the word “fiat” and say it doesn’t matter what it actually means is a signal that a lot of the money in bitcoin right now is not the groundswell of a changing world.";2;0;False;cdimeo;drga0v6;Vocabulary for the newbies by u/KMSouthgate;7kl1gq;https://i.redd.it/i1j5t0bjho401.jpg

What your describing as being unfair has to do with the *law*, not with the specific assets people hold. The law applies whether people hold value in dollars, stocks, bonds, crypto, or gold.

So again, what rules apply to dollars that ""funnel wealth back up to the top"" that don't apply to BitCoin?";1;1;False;pelican_chorus;drh3bbg;"JP Morgan CEO who said only criminals use bitcoins is accused by a Senator of illegal activities.

Again, here's what I just told you.

>Fiat money is created by a central organization. They can decide to create any amount of money and distribute it to specific ""winners"" they've chosen. Their criteria for who wins can be changed at any time with no notice. 

Bitcoin is _not_ created by a central organization. The rules by which new bitcoin is distributed were laid out when it launched and it can't be changed on you without your permission.

> It's still taxable. It can still be subject to civil forfeiture, under threat of jail.

That doesn't have anything to do with my explanation, and assumes the government can prove one owns the bitcoins. 

> The US Government can still bail out a company that lost all its BitCoin, just like they could a company whose stocks collapsed.

In which case the money would be raised from American taxpayers, not from dollars held.

"> Are you trying to convince me of something?

I'm trying to understand your position, and the advantages of BTC. I haven't had this conversation hundreds of times.

You talked about there being ""unfair rules that funnel wealth back up to the top"" with our current system. I agree that those rules exist, and that many laws maintain or increase the economic divide. I'm just really trying to understand how they don't apply to BTC.

My understanding is that the majority of the pieces of the structure that maintains this division, and ""funnels wealth to the top,"" is the structure laws, taxation, and government spending.

From what I can tell, you understanding is that the **only** piece that matters is the ability to print money.

I'm sure I'm getting your position wrong, but if not, I can't agree with you. For example, you mentioned governments bailing out companies. This is not done by printing money. This is done by spending taxation revenue.

The ability to print money seems to me to be a minor part of the system that maintains the division of wealth. All the rest of the system still applies to Bitcoin, like it does to stocks, or holding Euros, or gold. So I don't see how Bitcoin solves this, since the state's laws still apply.

> ...and assumes the government can prove one owns the bitcoins.

...well, yes, all of my understanding is based on following the law. If we're assuming hiding wealth from the government, that's a different ballpark, since you're just talking about illegal activity. I could equally say just hiding all my cash and not reporting it is a new paradigm to affect the wealth structure in the US.

"> you understanding is that the only piece that matters is the ability to print money

No, I'm only talking about bitcoin **vs fiat currency**. If a law that creates inequality doesn't have anything directly to do with money, then it's outside the scope of this thread.

> I could equally say just hiding all my cash and not reporting it is a new paradigm to affect the wealth structure in the US.

No, you couldn't. Hidden cash will inflate away over time and is thus a terrible way to store wealth, and moving/spending it is difficult to do without detection. 

If gold could be secured with a secret passphrase, had a fixed supply, and could be moved out of the country easily, then I think a lot more people would own gold than do now. If people didn't need to trust their gold to banks in the first place, then bitcoin never would have been necessary.";1;1;False;Explodicle;drh9m3u;"JP Morgan CEO who said only criminals use bitcoins is accused by a Senator of illegal activities.

Great job man. You are smarter than most.

Like OP,The smartest ones are sellling right now. If I buy something for $5 and sell it for $10, I doubled my money. If the value climbs to $20, it doesn't matter, I still made a huge profit. People tend to look at lost opportunity instead of absolute values. This is why bubbles form. I don't know, nor does anyone else know when the whole house of cards is going to fall, but it will.
