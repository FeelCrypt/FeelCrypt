I do, plenty of times, not just in crypto, but I cut my loss every time instead of hoping it's coming back.

>If you do make money I figure the reward is the money itself and bashing in others doesn't make me any happier.   

Making money is great, but one of the sweetest joys is tasting my opponents' salty tears. I look forward to the day I get to dump my coins on a fresh sucker, for the money and the tears.

"I think that people should investigate by themselves (that's part of the fun) but there are so many posts that are repeating incorrect information that I want to help a little bit.
The following information is simplified and may contain errors, if you want the full technical details read the BIPs 

The Address: If an address starts with a 3 it only means it's using the BIP13 P2SH address format. The original purpose was to be able to send BTC to a redeemScript using a short address BIP16. One special case of a redeemScript is multisignature transactions. SegWit BIP141 also uses this format for P2WPKH-nested-in-P2SH and P2WSH-nested-in-P2SH addresses. The only way to know which case it is, is by looking at the transactions from that address. 
There are no outgoing transactions from the current prize address but there is one from the previous one 3CcxyPhyvyc3S9UuPfu42GNZLvVVV11Uk8, in there you can see that the previous address was P2WPKH-nested-in-P2SH. Although technically the new one could be different I think it's reasonable to assume is of the same type unless there is evidence of the contrary. To check transaction details you can go to https://blockchain.info/rawtx/2ace579f68059dfd8e4b467d98cd866385798c34a1a2263b0e6613045b86c8d8 or better to https://blockchain.info/tx/2ace579f68059dfd8e4b467d98cd866385798c34a1a2263b0e6613045b86c8d8?format=hex and paste the code in http://chainquery.com/bitcoin-api/decoderawtransaction 

Private Key Generation: Now, to spend the BTC you need the private key related to the public key. Technically that is just a number and it could be generated in different ways but a strong possibility in this case is that it has to do with the BIP39 words in the picture, if it is using BIP39 that suggests that is also using BIP32 for generating HD wallets. 
Since HD wallets can have multiple levels, the BIP43 standarized a purpose level and BIP44 is a specific case of BIP43 with more levels. BIP49 is basically a copy of BIP44 but for P2WPH-nested-in-P2SH addresses so it has a different purpose number to be intentionally incompatible with BIP44 wallets. 
The site https://iancoleman.io/bip39/ also has a BIP141 tab, the BIP32 and BIP141 tabs generate the same private and public keys for the same derivation path, they just encode the addresses differently.
All of this is to say that you can't get the purpose number only from the address but BIP49 sounds promising.

Words: Assuming that the solution to the puzzle is a mnemonic sentence using BIP39 words, the sentence can have 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 or 24 words. For every 3 words there is a bit of checksum so for 3 random BIP39 words you have a 1/2 chance that the sentence is valid, for 12 (4 bits of checksum) the chance is 1/16. If the sentence is valid it is converted (using a passphrase if present) to a seed which then can be used to generate the keys using BIP32 (or other methods). Assuming the sentence has 12 words, even if you know the words but not the order, those are around 12!/16 valid sentences (if you are not using the full BIP39 dictionary the number can be different depending on the distribution of the words).

Picture: 
* There are 116 BIP39 words in total and 50 inside the circle, always including capitalized words. 
* The frequency to size of the words match (mostly) if you use the version of the whitepaper in http://git.dhimmel.com/bitcoin-whitepaper/, convert it to text and split (add spaces to) some formulas.
* The font for most of the text is ""Work Sans"" and the lambda symbol uses ""Apple SD Gothic Neo"" but I don't know the font for the ""FULLWIDTH EQUALS SIGN"" and the .notdef glyph.

"That's possible, sure. It's incredibly unlikely though, given that BTC is incredibly useful, and cannot simply be killed like a website. 

People have given value to bitcoin. They will be hard pressed to lose that value. Bitcoin will always have use cases. With 3rd gen blockchain, bitcoin will be inter-operable with other services. So even if bitcoin isn't the lead dog, it will still exist and have value.

Right. I guess the socialist monopoly is the one where nobody ever has enough capital to buy, income and everything you buy with income is taxed at ~20%, people die waiting on their shit healthcare to schedule them an appointment with no possibility of a second opinion, Germany makes off like a bandit with the Euro while it makes everything expensive in their EU partner nations, and most importantly everyone is dependent on the government and self-determinism is a thing of the past.

LOL so an employer firing workers is the same as telling them they can't create a collective bargaining group. There's two sides to a negotiation, the employer and the employees. Once again you want to make unions mandatory because that's the only way they work. Socialism is enslavement.

> Your workers cant do shit. You have all the power over them. They can quit, but unless they can afford to be without a job or are able to find a new job they cant quit. 

Oh noooo. You have to work to survive? What horrors! Are you gonna start railing against the evils of entropy next? The employer is just as subservient to his workers. If I don't provide compensation that is competitive to what you can get elsewhere, then I won't get employees! Who the hell cares that I make $30, the workers agreed to $20. If they don't like it, they can renegotiate or find work elsewhere. That's how life works.

> I mean we can look through the other OPEC nations. UAE is really the only good one and with a higher GDP per capita than Venezuela 

And none are about to collapse. Your dishonesty is breathtaking.

> Wow i agree. Its actually insane how you can look at the massive drop in life quality russian males had after the collapse of the soviet union. They were wayyy above america in calorie intake until 1991. 

Read The Gulag Archipelago if you want to know what life was like in soviet russia.

> No. Those are horrible countries.

If you specifically fire the ones that are in a collective bargaining group then yeah. 


>And none are about to collapse. Your dishonesty is breathtaking.


Ok so again OPEC includes Algeria, Iraq and Agola. They are pretty close to collapse  

>Read The Gulag Archipelago if you want to know what life was like in soviet russia.

Where did i defend Gulags? I was just pointing out that quality of life was wayy bigger in soviet Russia than western Russia. Calorie intake and life expectancy were way higher than America.
