"Fair enough, I think there might be a small number of people willing to do this - the difficulty is how they find each other. I’m struggling to imagine a product that doesn’t take Fiat to create in some way.   
  
Consider a handmade hat is going to need wool, which has to be farmed, treated, coloured and shipped. Each part of this process is currently done for fiat so each one of the actors providing these processes would have to be willing to do it for BTC. This will be a hard sell as they in turn have suppliers who don’t accept BTC.   
  
The alternative is that someone buys wool in bulk for fiat and resells for a fixed price in BTC. This is all well and good until the price changes such that either 

- this person is not able to buy sufficient wool with the fixed amount of BTC they get from sales (because Fiat buying power of BTC has dropped)   
or   
- the hat maker struggles to sell their hat for BTC because the hat is overpriced relative to Fiat (because BTC price has gone up).   
  
Fundamentally the issue is the consumer who, while earning a wage in Fiat, will struggle to rationalise buying items at a fixed BTC price if it is poor value for money in comparison to selling their BTC for fiat.

">more interest in cryptocurrencies than there ever was

Check google statistics, check any search engine's stats, the numbers are dwindling for any terms related to crypto. Services left and right (Amazon, Microsoft, Reddit) are removing BTC payment options. '''normie''' money is not coming in, the volume on every coin is dwindling. You'd be right by saying blockchain tech has good interest, which it does, but the currencies themselves are losing interest. 

Also, 8k is 40% of 20k, so yes you could say currently it is down 60% from it's high. At it's low, it was 70% down from it's high. A healthy correction doesn't lose 70% of it's value. The stock market is in a correction right now. From it's peak to it's low of the correction, its barely an 11% drop.

"I don't think adoption is slowing. I think it is still accelerating. Reddit or any legal US business is not a good proxy for Bitcoin adoption.

Bitcoin solves a trust issue. In a high trust society that's like opening a lemonade stand next to a Fanta factory. Nobody cares about our lemonade, except the usual hippies that are happy to pay extra for organic stuff due to higher motives.

The story is different in other places where they only sell warm piss to the people. The problem there is that people are a) very used to the piss and b) don't have a bottle opener.

Look at social media, in a society with reasonable freedom it's not rocking the boat. In a dictatorship it causes revolutions. Bitcoin will have a similar effect once it sinks in.

"Don't get me wrong, I spend more than my share of time on reddit, but I can't say that it's ""essential"" to my survival or success.  I've gotten plenty of great ideas, asked lots of questions, had lots of laughs here, but the vast majority of it is ""junk"".  As useful and entertaining as it is for me, there's very little substance here that can't be found in a book, a library, in the company of friends, or other sites that have much more refined and concentrated data.  Sure, the internet is and always will be an important tool for mankind, but it doesn't control us (unless we allow it to).  Of all the memories I've had over the years, the most memorable and satisfying were spent outdoors, camping, snowboarding, doing stuff that didn't involve a computer screen.  I get that not everyone's profession allows them to step away, and not everyone wants to and it's up to them how they spend their time. Yet some of the most neurotic people I know are addicted to social media.  They think they aren't in control if they're not checking twitter, and at that point it's controlling them.  This is why a lot of highly successful people advocate the importance of meditation, yoga, spending time in nature, etc.  Plenty of billionaires in this world who never touched reddit and spend close to zero time on social media platforms.

"Right now, a whole lot of the amazing projects funded on bitcoin gains in Q4 (e.g. pineapple fund charities) will be ploughing that accrued capital into actual real world things, be that staff hires, office spaces, research and education, clean water procurement (in the case of some African projects).  

Amazing art projects like the [bitcoin roundabout](https://amp.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/83vfw1/this_roundabout_was_just_unveiled_in_kranj/) in Slovenia requires cycling BTC back into fiat in order to pay the contractors, architects, builders, artists...

Not to mention all the programmers, designers and engineers behind all this that still need to eat ramen :p

At the end of the day, it doesn't matter at this juncture whether we're using bitcoin, euros, tally sticks or sea shells to breathe oxygen into all these endeavours, as long as we're doing a better job funding the right people for the right reasons than an old world that's struggling to breathe due to a whole bunch of red tape stymying progress...

"Bitcoin is Not centralized. Neither is LN. The only part of LN (like I have said) that is centralized is that it's centralized to the blockchain for disputes, which means it's decentralized by proxy.
Because Bitcoin is a peer to peer/decentralized system, despite the fact that your transactions must be sent to nodes. The whole point is that it is a trustless peer-to-peer system. It doesn't have to be direct, and BitTorrent for example isn't either. Yes, sometimes your BTC transaction gets routed from one node and propegates to the rest. But it doesn't affect it's trustless nature. 

Lightning network is quite brilliant, really. Basically, LN doesn't really have an inharent security, but piggybacks off the blockchain for disputes only, with a fine/court system (controlled by the blockchain). Brilliant.

"Well no, you only need to do that when you have the app open. Otherwise, the ONLY thing you need to do is listen for your peer updating the channel state, or check the blockchain every 8 hours, which would suffice. You can update everything else when the app is open, but channel state triggers are it, for each of your peers with channels to. 

It really isn't that complex. 

I personally have about 0.2 BTC total across 3 channels. I use Eclair for Android, built for mainnet. I can send you the APK. 

Look at the source code. It checks every 4 hours, and only holds a wakelock for about 1.5 seconds. In the meantime, the brilliance of the internet is that it doesn't need to be listening all the time, because if the peer wants to make a change to the channel, the app can detect that, wake up, and then go back to sleep. It takes 1/2 a second. Hardly any battery usage. 

It's like your messages app. Your text message app doesn't stay awake the whole time, it is waiting for a trigger before it runs, specifically, SMS incoming. It wakes up, alerts you, does it's thing, and is suspended. 
If you're a hub, sure, it's going to be kept awake. But you can opt not to route payments through yourself, or only when there is a greater than specified fee for profit.

And it's actually the intelligence agency that brought the case forward and presented it as it was. It's a moot point to say that the judicial system convicted him. Obviously they did. That's how it works. But they didn't create and present the case as it was. That was the FBI.

Saying ""I watched a documentary"" is like saying ""I was too high to read anything"". Nah, that's a lol. But really though, you're never going to learn much by watching a documentary.

"As an example, in Birmingham in 1974 a bomb went off at a local pub killing 21 people and injuring 182 others. Six lads from Ireland were arrested and accused of being in the provisional IRA. They were sentenced to life in prison. 16 years later their convictions were quashed by the Court of Appeal. At that stage one of the men had died in prison and everyone else was mentally fucked from the psychological trauma of how they came to be arrested and how they were treated in prison. It was, and still is, a fucking disgrace. 

By your logic: there were only six people caught, six who got arrested and six who were tried. Are you genuinely retarded? You fuckboi.

The judges used this fact in their final rulings. Correctly so, if I might say: clearly he wasn't the nonviolent leader he proclaimed to be. And the corrupt actions of the FBI don't change that fact.";2;1;False;ThomasVeil;dweqnh9;Today it's Ross Ulbricht's 5th birthday spent in prison. Happy Birthday Ross!
