"I do, but I also understand at that point you're talking about shifting transactions for the entire planet into an entirely new system.  Who stands to lose the most?  Those that are most tied into the previous system. 

Don't underestimate what a focused F100 company could do to the situation.

Who cares if that's more than golds market cap. Gold is a pointless asset compared to bitcoin. We will watch over the next 5 years as bitcoin becomes the world wide safe harbor and precious metals lose a bunch of their status as value stores.;2;1;False;fixedelineation;dkegnkl;John bets on Bitcoin;6nvgty;https://i.redd.it/giqzirlwg7az.jpg

use your mind to create an experiment. create a coin pre mined with 1 trillion space duck token. start mining space duck token.  now with friends you start trading your  space duck token token for 1 usd. So the official exchange rate of the  space duck token becomes the facto 1usd What's the market cap of  space duck token? Let's say I mine your token and people buy it. All fine. Because you will not sell your 1 trillion stash.... ahhh what is the market cap again? ;2;0;False;Mordan;dkf4zr9;John bets on Bitcoin;6nvgty;https://i.redd.it/giqzirlwg7az.jpg

"What rational reason could he have for not accepting Bitcoin for the bet?

If we each put up 1 BTC today and he wins, he profits by over $500k. If he loses, he loses less than $500k.

If we each put up $500k today and he wins, he profits by only $500k (less than if we bet in BTC). If he loses, he loses $500k (more than if we bet in BTC).

By insisting the bet be in dollars he is capping his potential gain and maximizing his potential loss.

I guess the most likely explanation is that he's kind of crazy.";1;0;False;dooglus;dkfssiy;John bets on Bitcoin;6nvgty;https://i.redd.it/giqzirlwg7az.jpg

Okay then let's compare it to something else then. 9.55t$ is close to more than US Dollars in circulation if you take 12t$ as the number of dollars as there are different ways to calculate it but that's the highest one pretty much. Anyone can agree that USD will crumble and there has to be a currency that will take it's place. Bitcoin is the best option obviously, though there are still fixes to do. And yet, even with bitcoin surging and usd falling at the same time to a useless paper i can't see BTC going 500k$ in 3 years.;1;0;False;Alphazz;dkf5dy6;John bets on Bitcoin;6nvgty;https://i.redd.it/giqzirlwg7az.jpg

Bitcoin is essentially a VERY easy way to make loads of money just disappear. I predict people will one day set up accounts in tax havens to distract from their Bitcoin wallets. If that becomes common practice that people put their money out of sight and reach of their governments then Bitcoin will be crushed on an international level. There is absolutely no way anyone person could ever know about how much money you roughly have unless you tell them and that's pretty spectacular. ;1;1;False;;dkefqin;John bets on Bitcoin;6nvgty;https://i.redd.it/giqzirlwg7az.jpg
i didn't say speculate. Banks will use bitcoin as a store of value...like they use gold but with the advantages of the digital currency. it will be a collateral upon which they will be able to create credit.;1;0;False;Mordan;dkf4v56;John bets on Bitcoin;6nvgty;https://i.redd.it/giqzirlwg7az.jpg
