"At the end of be day, calling yourself a libertarian means as small a government as possible, a very very limited role of government in the economy, the least laws and regulations possible

The reason it lacks credibility as a real world position on real issues for government is because its stuck in a soup of theory and nuance and cafeteria pickibecause there's a lot of fairweather folks who like to call themselves libertarianism because it sounds tough.

I'm not the one gate keeping. You're essentially saying ""I'm a communist but I also think private property and the ability to accumulate wealth is a good thing that should be allowed"".

Can't be both ways. if you think it can, you simply don't understand the ideology you're labelling yourself with.

The fact that you think ones attitudes towards the free market are somehow seoerable and distinct from libertarianism strongly suggests this.

""Im a libertarian who supports a government that confiscates and redistributes wealth in the name of fairness and regulates business and the market in the name of the collective good""

Ok bud.

"As small a government as possible.... And no smaller.

That doesn't mean 0 government.  It means just enough to ensure the freedom of those it governs *within limits*.

The sticky point always comes down to the disagreement over how much is enough.  And someone still has to pay for what little there is.

"> All political philosophies start with vague platitudes, and those are refined through argument, debate, and into implementation of policy.

Most political philosophies also know that they have no real basis in the real world, and do their best to translate their vague platitudes into an actual position. Think of it as ""applied philosophy"" vs. just nonsense empty theory. 

That's why very few people apply titles to their omnivorous and nuanced views the way libertarians so boldly call themselves libertarians. Even Bernie qualifies that he's not really a ""socialist"" 

If political discussions are about the nuts and bolts of what the current government and structure should do over the next 4 years to address the issues of today, vague platitudes about individual freedom and liberty and natural rights and eat pray love really have 0 value whatsoever. 

If your house is on fire, are you going to discuss water temperature and composition? Of course not. Nor would you seek out someone who wants to discuss whether or not the water is legitimate. 

So if the issue is ""Mr. X may or may not be inciting violence and we need to discuss the limits of our society regarding whether or not what he said specifically falls within the realm of free spech"", the following would be an insufficient and essentially irrelevant response

> Freedom of speech being a principle, the challenge of 'should people be free to incite violence through speech' is something that needs to be reconciled. Violent assault is a violation of an individual's rights, so inciting violence through speech is a violation of the rights of the victim. Coming to the conclusion that the state should protect its citizens against the incitement of violence through speech is perfectly in line with both principles.
 
Because it provides 0 guidance whatsoever, but I feel like the person saying it would think they actually participated and provided some sort of insight. 

That is essentially libertarianism. Responding to the real world with unspecific (and often contradictory and inconsistent) theoretical platitudes . 

What's hilarious is that if someone described their political views as ""I'm a Sophist/Platoist"", they'd be dismissed and laughed out of the room

And yet people still think it's somehow legitimate to say their political views are ""Libertarian"", as though it somehow exists any more out of the disconnected vacuum of political philosophy. ";1;0;False;corkyr;ea1ckjz;A Picture is Worth a Thousand Words.;9xkzxm;https://i.imgur.com/X7KXRvy.jpg

"You haven't really addressed my initial and core criticism, which is that is

1) Libertarianism is naive and very faith-based, as it presupposes that individuals will voluntarily cooperate, contribute to common problems, and keep their personal behaviors to themselves and away from impacting others. The existence of many laws, regulations, or government policies are therefore unnecessary and probably more harmful than just leaving it up to people. With more freedom for individuals, everything will magically become better than it is now. 

2) Rules make things worse, ergo fewer rules will make things better. Founded upon the flawed process that totalitarian government has been generally bad, and freedom/capitalism has been generally good, ergo more capitalism and freedom and less government will be better. We don't need government anyways because people will voluntarily support and protect the things that government - with all its resources and a monopoly power - cannot seem to adequately support or protect. 

3) Libertarianism is closer to a religion than it is a real political position, as its very much tied to abstract scripture and faith in a system to provide as long as we believe in it and let it flourish. The preacher says ""if we all love Jesus and believe in God and create a society where these things are paramount, things will become better, safer, and more prosperous"", while the libertarian essentially subs out ""Jesus and God"" for ""freedom and individuality"" 

It's pretty glib, easily dis-proven by simple observation, and certainly overlooks any sort of complexity in the world whatsoever, but faith doesn't care about that. 

There is very little room for ""belief"" in discussions about government, just as there is for urban planning, engineering, science, the arts. When there's a discussion about where to build the subway or who should build it, the adults in the room have little time or need for someone coming in to share their ""beliefs"" about subways, mass transit, construction, or why the whole thing can and should privately fundraised through corporate and personal donations and its route dictated by direct referendum in the name of letting ""democracy and the free market decide

Just as the Pentagon has no use for a pacifist coming in to discuss theory and beliefs when they're planning an invasion or the next year's defense budget. What value would that have, entertaining such theoretical, useless nonsense? 

Ultimately, it's absolute nonsense to suggest that the way to solve problems that we don't have enough consistent money, coordination, or coherent power to deal with through government will somehow be easily solved by having less government and there less money, less coordination, and less coherent power. 

As much as it seems nice that all we have to do is have faith in one another to get along, work together, and stay out of each other's space voluntarily :)

""uhhh (backpeddles) no that's not what I believe...that's uh...the other guys.

"Hahahahahah you actually did it! 

And you even included the ""all free societies have been successful, than more freedom - more success"" nonsense! 

Freedom is like fire, and communism is like cancer.

Both have killed millions. One is far more useful and has far more value than the other.

But only a retard would say ""we need more fire because fire has given us great things!! It's kept us alive and driven industrialization! Anything that restrains or manages fire is holding us back from our real potential!""
