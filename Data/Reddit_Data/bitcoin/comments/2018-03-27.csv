What I'm doing is gambling, not gonna argue against that, all I'm saying is that the income in fiat cover all the costs while the crypto income becomes pure profit.

">More sales are beneficial. You aren't going to lose anything selling more product - even with a 20% depreciation.

If you assume no cannibalizing of sales, that for example the only people who were buying games on Steam with bitcoin are the kind of people who never bought a game on Steam before and would never again if bitcoin was removed. Otherwise you're just encouraging people to move to a less profitable payment method for no benefit.

The only businesses I see likely to have no cannibalization are ones specifically geared around bitcoin (i.e. selling a bitcoin t-shirt), so the only people you are attracting are people who want to spend bitcoin specifically, not just people who want to use the most convenient payment method to get goods and services.

>Right, but if you have a business all set up most of your costs are fixed

The cost of implementing a new payment system isn't fixed, it would actually cost quite a bit both in implementation, and maintenance. Making sure just adding it didn't break anything else would be a significant cost, and even more costly if you don't test properly and break something, losing hundreds of dollars of sales for every second it takes to fix.

E-commerce isn't just set and forget. You have to have at least one person (if not a team of people) monitoring it so they can quickly jump on any bugs, exploits and updates that are required. 

Then there's also other costs like customer service. One of the biggest problems Steam was having with bitcoin is that the value of bitcoin would change between the sending of funds and the receiving, and Steam wouldn't send the game until the customer sent the remainder, which caused all kinds of customer service shit with people trying to get refunded or work out why they didn't get sent the game they paid for.

For a small enough % of extra sales these costs would outweigh any benefit.

>But for a site like reddit to not receive donations (literally all gold is) in bitcoin just shows how bad bitpay was.

By that logic it also shows how bad bitcoin is because they could have just put an address up for donations, but presumably the effort it would require to co-ordinate the back end for it would not be worth the small amount of money it would bring in.

"Theoretically it would be possible to create a cryptocurrency that adjust it's price after the USD for instance or in a way you would define as ""stable"". Problem is that you would have to trust someone, just like with USD. You would have to trust them not to silently rob you of 2% every year. You would have to trust them to not irresponsibly lend out money causing financial crices just like they do with fiat.

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies with limited supply may be volatile now but a market based value on currency seems like a reasonable future. For a market based value to become stable we need adoption and adoption can only work if merchants accept it as a payment method. Its one of those rock and a hard place situations one could say.

I'm a merchant too and around 25% of my customers pay with Bitcoin, I always hold. Should anything happen to the price, those who pay with fiat will cover the losses. Should the price go up on the other hand I'm offering huge discounts for everyone and enjoy a great profit for myself. I think it mostly depends on how much your profit per sold item is.

"I dont think I agree with most of your post . I dont even care what your profit is nor do I need to know.  You can't do most of your business in anything that wildly fluctuates hourly and daily unless your margins/reserve cash can cover changes of 50% or more which is kind of fucking ridiculous. 

let's take your 25% of your customer base.  Had they all paid at the peak of crypto for 20k and the price dropped by more than 50% just about any business who was going all in on crypto would have been bankrupt or out a shit load of fucking bread.  

When I say stable I know that a 10k payment given to me in USD is still worth 10k USD and will buy the same order from my supplier as it did a month ago.

That's not bitcoin.  That same purchase at ATH vs now would be half as much inventory able to be bought.  

This is not a rock and hard place thing.  It wont be stable until it's regulated, and regulating it takes away from what people wanted it to be in the first place.  

Your last paragraph makes zero sense.  If you have  a million dollars in profit, and 250k is bitcoin and 750k is USD at the time of payment, the next day bitcoin could be down 10% and worth only 225k and your 750k is still standard USD with the same buying power.  You've lost 25k due to nothing more than volatility we dont see in just about any currency.  Youre gambling, and gambling is not a viable long term way to run a business.  

I dont see how people paying in fiat are covering those losses.  Those losses are yours.  You incurred them as soon as you took bitcoin and the price dropped. 

Youre basically trying to suggest that people should be paying in stocks which are inherently risky for a reason. You cannot operate a business on risky money for long term viability.

"People thought it was going to be the next big thing so wanted to be on the ground floor.

Then they realized most people with bitcoins are more interested in hoarding them than spending them, and the accompanying price volatility makes it pretty useless for business cashflow, so you just have to convert to USD anyway (which costs more). everyone with bitcoin also has USD (or other native fiat) that they can pay in any way, and they'd much rather spend USD than bitcoin. So the only people you end up attracting who wouldn't have just paid in USD are people spending it as a gimmick, which isn't a significant percentage of trade for most businesses that aren't selling bitcoin t-shirts.

"But you're operating under the assumption that the fraudulent node is 100% certain that I'm also telling the truth. Let's continue with your example in the comment above, with the only change being that I actually still do have the data:

You and I have a channel open with each other. I **pretend to lose all tx history in some hardware failure or other catastrophe**. I ask you what the current state of the channel is and you lie to me.

You almost certainly would lie in your own favour. I notice this, and now I can do one of two things: close the channel with the appropriate balances and open one elsewhere, or leave the channel open and wait for your next transaction. As soon as you make a fraudulent transaction, you'll lose your funds to me.

"I agree for the most part. The way I understand this, is that it is more of a protocol issue.

With Bitcoin you always have the ability to backup your keys before using them. There are definitely better ways now than there was.

With Lightning Network however, I don't believe it is possible to perform the backup until after the new state has been negotiated. So if anything fails between the state change and finishing the backup, bad things happen. I am not saying it can't be solved.

There is a limit. Transactions that are so low value that they are worth less than the cost of storing them and transmitting them forever across thousands of computers will never make sense to put in a blockchain no matter how big blocks  get but can make sense in a layer 2 solution. Layer 2 expands the space of things that are economically viable.;1;0;False;MoneyPowerNexis;dwc32lc;⚡ Hackers tried to steal funds from a Lightning channel, just to end up losing theirs as the penalty system worked as expected;875avi;https://twitter.com/alexbosworth/status/978069194385252352
"Well, there does have to be *some* level of fee pressure. We can expect, that as with a gas, transactions volumes will rise to fill whatever space is available to them. I think we could have 8-MB blocks today, and perhaps even 16-MB. But we would have to hold at the level for a long time, since the effects on node sync time lag far behind the block size.

If 16-MB blocks were full, that is 800GB / year, so we get 7 years from a $150 6/TB hard drive, and that is a spinning drive. But as for syncing time, lets say it takes 4 days to sync now with a spinning disk on a 5-year old laptop. That is 4-days per 200/GB of chain data. Every year of 16-MB blocks would take an additional 16 days to validate. So by next year we would be at 20 days to sync, and three years from now it would take 52 days, and 6 years out? 100 days to sync the chain.

It is reasonable to expect performance improvements would pull that number lower, but we shouldn't assume miracles. So the sync times would keep getting longer due as the chain grows longer, but shorter as computers get faster. At some point we can assume we would hit a  maximum sync time, after which the exponential increases in performance would win out over the linear increases in block length.

But for 16-MB blocks, that reversal could be 5 - 15 years away, and how long would it take to sync at the max? It seems like it could easily be many months.

So yeah, I think we could handle 16-MB today, although I would prefer 8-MB. But it couldn't be the first increase of many, at least not with Bitcoin remaining something that we want people to able to validate themselves.";1;2;False;CubicEarth;dwbzlnq;⚡ Hackers tried to steal funds from a Lightning channel, just to end up losing theirs as the penalty system worked as expected;875avi;https://twitter.com/alexbosworth/status/978069194385252352

"One of us has incorrect information if this is indeed the case so allow me to recap my understanding and you can correct me if I have misunderstood something otherwise I can't see an issue in my suggestion...


1) A counterparty node can take all the funds in a channel if they detect an old state is broadcast because newer transactions reveal the old 'R' which allows for all the funds to be spent.

2) A node can normally only obtain the funds owed to it at anytime by simply and safely broadcasting the latest state.

3) Both nodes will have a copy of the latest channel state for both participants.  Therefore an old state is only broadcast when one of the following things happen

* One of the nodes has forgotten the latest state (HW failure/software bug/reset before serialising to disk).

* The counterparty node is being malicious and trying to spend the funds without the counterparty noticing.

* A hacker has obtained an old tx in the payment channel and broadcast it on the blockchain to annoy those on the channel.

This therefore means having the two nodes involved in the payment channel asking 'what do you think the latest state is?' via a timestamp/hash of last state is a simply sanity check nothing has gone awry.  If there is a discrepancy it doesn't necessarily mean they have to share and agree the latest state, merely they should both stop using the channel and wait for the counterparty to publish the latest state if the counterparty has a more recent timestamp.

2. Lighting is an off chain network. The only place where the channel data is stored (as far as I know, I haven't read the spec) is on the devices of the two parties (until they close the channel). 

 So if you did lose your device and are restoring from an older backup, you may lose some transaction data. At which point you have to trust the other party.

 But you don't have to tell the other party how much of the history of the channel you have. 

 For example, the channel had 10 transactions made. Your backup only has a record of 5 transactions. You ask the other party for a copy of the channel ledger, and they send you all 10 and everyone's happy.

 If the other party tries to cheat you, they can send an older version of the ledger. For example they pretend that the last transaction is transaction number 5. Since your backup has more transactions than that, either both parties had a catastrophic data loss at the same time (unlikely), or they're trying to scam you. In which case you know the other party is lying, and this can be handled accordingly.

"Entrapment just requires that the crime would have been unlikely to have occurred without the police being involved. In to catch a predator the police simply pose as an underage girl and let things play out. If they instead emailed people and offered them sex with a minor that would be entrapment. In the silk road case they extorted him and also approached him with the solution. DPR even countered with just wanting his location to scare him and the feds told him that wouldn't work and he would lose any chance at stopping the extortion if he wasted his chance.

In any case their account of events is textbook extortion but that's also probably irrelevant as all of that evidence is based solely on the word of some corrupt FBI agents who stole millions of dollars.

"Please don’t try and sell me on the “he was doing the public good, he was a hero, he was altruistic” bullshit. If he was that altruistic, he didn’t give any of the profits away to good causes or fund things that could’ve made a difference, nor did he fight for against the mass incarceration’s from the drug war. He was completely self serving the whole time. 

When he had his opportunity to do some good, he made as much money as possible, tried to have people killed who could’ve brought him down and fuck everyone else.

What he did was gave drug users the feeling of anonymity when they bought their drugs over the internet. People still got ripped off, in fact people got ripped off in larger cash quantities thanks to SR, (Tony76 made tens of thousands by ripping people off, he later tried to have killed and his roommates) great “harm reduction that is.

In fact SR encountered the same problems that drug users in real life face and it just meant rich kids could buy drugs anonymously online without the stigma around buying it on the street.

Do you get all teary eyed and such for Pablo Escobar? I mean Escobar was a violent psychopath but at least tried to give back to the people of Medellin, funding programs for literacy, built housing estates. Ulbricht took his money and tried to have people killed, then tried running away to The Caribbean.

Yes the drug war needs to end and reparations need to be done because of the horrific toll it’s taken but you don’t do that by setting up an online store and profiting off of the deaths of others, it makes it no different to a crack house, except there’s a star rating system. 

If you wanna argue morality and legality of the whole drugs debacle that’s a different issue and you’re welcome to but here’s a bitcoin forum about crypto currency and its use and someone who used the technology to facilitate crime.

Silk Road wasn’t an altruistic venture like it’s been historically revised to be by supporters of Ulbricht, it was a money making venture that people could use to get hold illegal drugs and guns using the foundling of bitcoin to facilitate, he used bitcoin to try and make an empire and failed spectacularly.

"I agree he was a greedy fool but he started something great. Scams occur a lot more often in the real world than they do on the dnm because reputation matters so much to an online profile. I think Ross started something great and the next iterations of it will be even better. The future markets will solve the issues his had. There will be decentralized trust less platforms with anonymous trades and a self regulating market place. I mainly say ""he's a hero"" because the opposition so loudly condemns him.

"Well that’s wrong, he sold his own magic mushrooms on the site. In fact his magic mushrooms hospitalised a girl after she had a bad reaction. 

No he didn’t “just run a website, like amazon” he facilitated the sale of drugs, guns and poisons all in the name of profit, he wasn’t altruistic like some people make out. If you sell black market guns, expect them to not be used for the most heroic actions but instead grizzly shit.

Amazon don’t sell illegal items and they don’t facilitate crimes so to compare the two is ludicrous.

I’m ok with guns being sold legally, but that’s the thing, these weren’t listed legally, there was no way to ensure those guns weren’t involved in crimes, it was via post and meant to give anonymity. If you’re pro-guns this kinda shit actively works against you as it makes it easier to clamp down on the sales of firearms.

"> Using drugs were ONLY for lowlife deadbeats when i grew up

Do you for sure know that? You don't think there were any highly successful CEO's, Doctors, Lawyers, Bankers, etc. doing lines of coke for fun? Or smoking weed? The large majority of those who use drugs are social users - they use them in the same way people use alcohol. They do it at parties with friends, or occasional small amounts after a hard day at work as an alternative to a beer or two.  A lot of high earning individuals actively seek out drugs like adderall or modafinil, with or without prescription, due to the fact they can work more hours with a higher degree of focus and do a better job.

Legalizing something is not the same thing as encouragement.  People still make their own decisions, and are not forced to seek out what they have no interest in.  If all drugs were made legal tomorrow would you go out and buy heroin? Based on your comments, I'd assume no - and that's the same thing with MOST people, because they know what it can do, and how it has one of the highest addiction potentials among all substances.  

If I really wanted heroin, I could probably find it - but I don't - I know the risks and it's not worth it to even try.  If I did, the fact it's illegal wouldn't stop me.  I think you'd find that the number of people who really, truly want to start taking drugs, but instead completely abstain due to the risk created by the illegality is pretty low.

Why don't you just read https://freeross.org/making-a-murderer/.
Everything is on there. 

“Of the six murder indictments trumpeted by the U.S. government in the days following Ross’s arrest, five have fallen off the table and the sixth sits untouched in a separate indictment (legalese for an unproven allegation) that was purposefully left out of the trial.” 

That one Maryland charge has been untouched for years, and it's about the staged murder of Curtis Green (who has publicly stated he doesn't think Ross ordered a hit on anyone). 
The other murder-for-hire allegations were never charged.

No. The government doesn't drop murder charges just in case they need them for later. Do you know of any criminal case where they did that ? If they had the proof, if they knew for sure Ross had ordered the hits, they would have formally charged him (Ross went to trial for drug charges only) These murder-for-hire allegations were conveniently announced the night before Ross's bail hearing.

Freeing slaves is not a good analogy to helping cartels sell drugs and guns. One is about raising the level of freedom to the same status as yours. A pretty defensible egalitarian goal. 

The other is helping pretty unsavory people make a profit by trading addictive products to literally anyone - even if they aren't old enough or competent enough to consent. Organized crime is responsible for a huge amount of death and misery. Not to mention forced prostitution, kidnap, etc...

Yes, because drug users choose to do drugs.  Not because drug dealers exist.  If a drug dealer laced heroin with Fentanyl, to get users addicted quicker, then I'd agree that it was not victimless.  That's coercion.  But if a drug dealer sells heroin to a willing buyer, and both people are voluntarily entering into the agreement of their own free will, then it's absolutely a victimless crime.

What you're saying is that if I sell a knife on Amazon, and the buyer murders someone with that knife, that both I, and the CEO of Amazon should be arrest for murder.  That's fucking absurd.  A knife may be dangerous, and it may lead to death, but the seller of the knife if not responsible in any way.

In theory. civil weighs more heavily interpretation of the code whereas the common system looks at president. 

In reality, they work very much the same and they both have idiosyncrasies and bullshit flaws. Neither way is perfect or procedurally treats every situation exactly the same. But, in both systems, people do not generally get sent to jail for accidentally committing an offence, unless the accident was caused by reasonable negligence. 


>Btw another difference ..

It's the same here  people talk about judges ""legislating from the bench"" all the time. Except here, where there's case law it sets precedents so it makes it easier for the next case.

">I don't claim to. We have experts in our society who we pay to make those decisions. 

Assuming that's even their intention, if they're such esteemed experts then why has the drug war had such disastrous results?

>Who is getting locked up for private use of their own medicine? By 'access to medicine', I assume you mean possession of hard drugs. They usually get off with warnings/confiscations/misdemeanors for a personal amount.

Depends on the substance/amount, some people just need a small amount of weed for insomnia, some people take LSD/Mushrooms for depression, some people need concentrated THC oil & some people need kratom to kick their opiate habit which is blanket banned in the UK and since it's not worth it for street dealers, 99% of access is cut off.

So there is a range from warnings to confiscation to criminal charges to complete inaccessibility.

If you think everyone who needs/wants an illegal drug for their condition can simply just go and get what they need off the street at a fair price, know it's safe & don't really have to worry about law enforcement then it just shows how ignorant you are on this subject & frankly I find it abhorrent that you would profess this ignorance to maintain the current situation when people are suffering because they can't/are too afraid to obtain what they need to be healthy.

Considering alcohol prohibition, considering marijuana prohibition, considering these events we know for a fact have had awful results that drastically improved after legalization (including usage rates going down) & the fact that your position is initiatory the burden of proof is on you to prove that prohibition is a good thing instead of me to prove it's a bad thing but I digress.

Off the top of my head some of the problems:

1) Vendors under prohibition must have a violence-based OR op-sec-based business model because there is no avenue for peaceful dispute resolution (you can no longer settle disputes in the courts) and technical/manufacturing innovation ceases to occur therefor to maintain market share the vendor (now a gang) must violently seize & defend territory.

2) Since technical innovation ceases to occur (because you can't have an efficient manufacturing/growing facility & you are shut out of labor market) & other costs rise such as the cost of smuggling due to loss of stock then prices rise, coupled with addiction this means users become impoverished and then the users also end up turning to violence to fund their addiction.

3) This causes land values to drop, homelessness, people who have never touched drugs are affected, they can't sell their house or if they do then it's at a significantly lower turnover, this creates a cycle of poverty.

4) Prison population rises to the point that prisons are at maximum capacity, a huge amount of tax payer money is then wasted to keep non-violent offenders locked up.

Not to mention that pharma is pumping out far more deadly, far more addictive LEGAL pills meanwhile most SR users were buying Weed, LSD & Coke, none of these would cause you anywhere near as much harm.

You seem pretty clueless about drug use, what drugs have you done? What's your understanding of addiction?

I'm kinda wasting my time, if you didn't even know about medicinal users being criminally charged sometimes up to 40+ years, I'm not trying to insult here but you do seem totally clueless & haven't done any research to know that gun sales never happened on SR like you said in the other comment thread, you've definitely never used SR or any other DNM.

"My position is pretty simple. The rule of Law is good because it protects the most vulnerable members of society. Strictly speaking it protects everybody, even if you are lucky enough to go through life without ever needing its protection.

The Law typically reflects the values of its society: this can be seen in the differences in laws from country to country. Now, representing everybody is always a difficult process, and if you have a fringe view, you might feel like the law doesn't represent you. The law doesn't care because it is an impartial representation of what society at large wants. 

Like you, I live in a society and enjoy its *many* benefits. So I adhere to the consensus set out in the laws. As a bitcoin advocate and man of the people, you are evidently pro-consensus. It's only when the consensus runs counter to your own interest that you suddenly want to throw out the whole system. 

Maybe some drugs need re-evaluating and re-classifying. This is obviously a tricky task, and we do entrust experts (who often devote their whole lives to their expertise) to make those decisions. Over time, when the facts align with the will of the people, the changes do happen. They happen slowly and this is good. Maybe things could become more efficient. Maybe the political class could be less corrupt. But generally I do think they have a tough and ugly job: representing the will of the people and keeping things stable, while also keeping themselves in office to hopefully affect meaningful change. 

The point is that we already have a system. Of course it is imperfect, it is human and humans are flawed. Of course it doesn't represent the totality of your interests. Why would it? It has to represent everybody as fairly as possible. If you don't like the system, you can change it. Abandoning it in favor of an anarchist utopia is not a meaningful option. If you disagree, go to a country where there is presently no rule of law. It still not much easier to run a hard drugs market and much, much harder to get virtually anything else done. Including sending ambulances to the dying. 

Saying ""fuck what the community thinks, I do what I want"" is always going to (rightly) result in your punishment and probable banishment by that community. This is a law of nature. 

The prison system is far from perfect, but it is telling that the punishment for most serious crimes is to literally remove you from your own society until you are ready to play by the rules again. What the community wants *must* be important to each individual, too. Otherwise society fails.

Like I said, there are laws I don't like. Maybe some drugs really are valuable and medicinal. If that's true, the changes will come. But it is a step too far to abandon the very concept of Law just because you don't like some of them. You enjoy its protection as much as anybody else. Getting rid of all drug laws is also problematic. I would personally say it's because there are many substances which are ripe for abuse and threaten the stability of society. But that's just my personal view. The reason most banned substances are banned is because most people want them that way.

There is not a single line in that transcript that implies that what they did wasn't entrapment. The judge used his belief that he was having someone murdered to influence sentencing, that in no way means that there wasn't entrapment when it very clearly is entrapment. Also the judge only considered what was allowed to be presented in court. While the FBI had already caught both corrupt FBI agents they did not disclose that material fact to the court and when the defense petitioned to include the corruption of agent Force the prosecution had that suppressed and claimed that the corruption case did not pertain to the trial even though agent Force had stolen those funds from the SR during the SR investigation.

"No. He's in jail for other charges. He's never been convicted of hiring hitmen because the state does not have the evidence to prove it. 

The prosecutors knew he created Silk Road. That's all Ross ever admitted to. His continued level of involvement in SR is questionable. I'm of the opinion that there were multiple DPR's and he was the fall guy. But I will change my opinion if new evidence is presented otherwise. 

The government's own witness had to be silenced when they brought up the multiple DPR theory in court. 

>You know he was.

I know he created Silk Road and had admin access when he was arrested. I don't know anything beyond that.

Any evidence presented that showed a chink in the prosecutions armor was shut down. Quickly. 

>incriminating chat logs on Ulbricht's own laptop

I'm sure the corrupt agents with admin access to SR and computer forensics specialties didn't tamper with it. Especially with what we now know about Ross's less than exemplary OPSEC.

Ross's case was a PR hit job. He was guilty before he was arrested. 

My absolute favorite part of the trial was when they paraded victims of drug overdoses out in front of the jury with no verification of the sourcing of their drugs or any personal responsibility for the victims. If you're going to shoot heroin, there's a risk of overdose. If I stab 10 people with a knife I bought on Amazon, does Jeff Bezos go to jail?

Ross isn't innocent. But nothing about his case was legit from the gathering of evidence, to the quashing of evidence, to the selection of the judge, to the sentencing. He does not deserve double life in prison without the possibility of parole. He was made an example of. The authenticity of those chat logs were never scrutinized and we may never know the truth. 

We know how dirty cops and feds can be in the US today especially for such a high profile case. I am generally distrustful of the government because they lied to us for decades about drugs (and still are). Ulbricht's trial is just another part of that.

I don't claim to. We have experts in our society who we pay to make those decisions. 

> The idea that you protect people by giving them a criminal record, locking them up, ruining their lives & restricting their access to medicine that they need is absolutely fucking laughable.

Who is getting locked up for private use of their own medicine? By 'access to medicine', I assume you mean possession of hard drugs. They usually get off with warnings/confiscations/misdemeanors for a personal amount.

In my society (European) we lock up the people engaged in the drugs trade, as a disincentive to engage in it. We do this because we want to limit the supply of addictive and destructive substances into our society. I don't necessarily agree that incarceration is a good idea for everyone, but we generally lock up nasty people who ruin others' lives. 

> Buying and selling?! You mean voluntarily exchanging goods between consenting adults, what a horrendous crime!

Not always adults. Not always mentally competent. And they aren't always 'goods'. Sometimes they are pretty bad substances, that have the potential to fuck up the social cohesion or turn them into desperate zombies. This isn't me talking, this is your whole society. We made the decision together, using experts whom we paid with your tax dollars.

You are a member of a society. The society you participate in has collectively made these decisions about these particular substances. Your society doesn't want heroin being sold on every street corner because it wrecks lives. You have to adhere to the consensus if you want to enjoy the benefits of the society you belong to. 

You may disagree with society's view of these substances, but you are in the minority. If your view was the majority (e.g. a lot of people don't really care about the legalization of cannabis), the vaues of your society would reflect that. And the laws ultimately reflect those values.

> You are the one trying to enforce your edicts on others, it's like a bully in a playground telling you to move to another playground if you don't wanna get smacked in the face. Your character is now utterly transparent.

"Agreed, there is a gradient and a spectrum to drugs.  There are levels to why items are illegal, unethical, or immoral.

* The most basic is that you oppose something because it is bad to you personally.

* Going further there are things that do not harm you or the people you know directly but hurt society.

"The legal status of a substance does not decide the worth of it's owner or seller in my opinion.  Just because a substance is against the law to have, does not make a person who has it or sells it a bad person.  You have to examine the law, and the substance/thing in question. 

When it comes to being charged with a crime, then yes - obviously the more illegal substances you're caught dealing with, the bigger your sentence, so that should be expected.

But, that aside - There is always going to be a demand for drugs. People have been experimenting with altered states of consciousness since basically as far back as history goes.

"Hi! You're from Iceland. So, maybe you are unaware that there is a vast difference, in US law, between how and if certain laws are enacted, even if we are talking about felonies. 

So, it's like this. If I accidentally open your mail. I won't go to prison. I won't even get a fine.  But, the law is there to deter and convict people who interfere with the mail system and personal correspondence. And, that's how it's prosecuted, if it's prosecuted. 

Meanwhile, all narcotics regulation is designed to control the substance and all the economic activity surrounding it. It's an entirely different class of felony, carrying different penalties, that's designed to do entirely different stuff.  But, they are both felonies because it was decided, erroneously or not, that both of these crimes potentially possessed grave harm to society as a whole. On top of all that there is whole other conversation to have about the limits of ""Prosecutorial discretion"". 

I feel like if you don't automatically understand this distinction it's not worth having a conversation about it. You are at best grossly misinformed. But, more than likely, you are simply under the delusion that everything can be, should be, or is examined on the exact same basis and pursued the exact same way. Things are not like that here.  It's a complex system, it's not perfect, and not all laws are well written. There's a whole lot of nuance.  And, that nuance and complexity is exactly how you get into dumb shit like ""three felonies a day"". 

>Then surely the law is delusional in that regard.

Not really. No. According to the letter and spirit of our drug/organized crime laws, Ross should 100% be in jail.  He broke those laws with impunity, he was engaged in organized crime, he engaged in and facilitated drug trafficking. And, he got a fair trial.

And, had he not gone down for any of that, they would have gotten him for tax evasion. Or, they wouldn't have attempted to trie him on the basis of ordering a hit on someone.  They didn't do either of those things because they had him on all the other things. And, it's very common not to pursue every possible charge, especially when there's a whole landry list of offences. 

See, if you don't know that - just as a general citizen, there's no point in the conversation. You're over there trying to argue that what he did is imaginary and has no real world reality or harm. But, loads of people negatively impacted by drug cartels and addicts would seriously disagree. In essence, according to our laws and the general moral sentiment behind them, he did not commit a ""victimless"" crime.

Why is Germany the only country where its okay to use a slang term to refer to them? Nazi is not a word.

"> You mean for example the Sudetengerman partisans in Czechoslovakia sponsored by Germany to mess things up and incite violence against them. Such oppression. You know you are citing literal nazi propaganda from the time? 

You realize you're saying they were oppressed, but that they brought it on themselves by being troublemakers, right? I'm not sympathetic to the Germans. Frankly I think the Czechs did the right thing by finally kicking the ethnic Germans out after WW2, even though it was essentially ethnic cleansing. There was more oppression of the German minority in western Poland (which actually was part of Germany before WW1). Saying ""go back to Germany"" doesn't work very well when the borders change.

I'll be brief about economics. First, the economy was historically bad during Weimar, a point I assume we would agree on. All the Nazis had to do was be not-worse-than-Weimar to be considered a ""revival"" -- a low bar. The Nazis instituted public works programs, similar to what FDR was doing in the US at the same time. My understanding is that this reduced unemployment and provided a temporary boost to the economy. But I'm no expert. And I oppose those policies, both when implemented by FDR and by Hitler. The real ""Wirtschaftswunder"" came *after* WW2 with the pro-market reforms of Erhard. Don't get the impression I'm pro-Nazi, or pro-socialism in any form. I'm not.

> Now back to The_Donald with you, if that is your understanding of German contemporary policy.

I can see I've really upset you. I'm not a supporter of Trump, but I take great pleasure in how much emotional difficulty he is causing people -- especially the people who've made excuses for ""leaders"" like Merkel or Obama in the recent past. The way I described the current European situation is accurate. You know it and I know it. Germany is the dominant member of the EU. There is no denying that. Merkel alone invited the refugees. She did so explicitly. And Germans have reelected her (sort of) since that happened. That was a German policy forced onto Europe. Deny it all you want, everyone saw it happen. Then when too many came, Germany used their influence on EU institutions to try to force migrant quotas on neighboring countries like Poland and the Czech Republic. These countries are perfectly willing to tell Merkel and the Germans, you know what, fuck off. On the other hand, I don't think these countries are actually willing to leave the EU over it, so there will be a conflict for a long time. It's a conflict the Germans started, again.

The reality is that Germany survived Hitler, barely. History will show whether Germany survives Merkel.

I wish being 'anti-fascist' were the norm. With most people if they see someone who looks like them who makes passionate speeches saying ""we're stronger together"" and that we should ""move forward"" but it's only those backwards idiots who are ""holding us back"" -- most people cheer them. The only difference seems to be which ""leaders"" do you think looks right and who do you think the backwards idiots are. Sometimes someone will stand up and say: ""We're stronger if we individually follow our own paths and forge our own destinies!"" to no effect. Fundamentally, people like fascism. They like to feel part of a group and blame all their problems on that other group.

"> But, you're not going to convince me that felonies anyone innocently commits due to legislative overreach is in any way equivalent to operating a full on drug trafficking operation on the dark web.

My point is that they are in the eyes of the law equivalent.

Which is an issue when people get hit by them unjustly. They and others seeing that go and fall into a thinking trap which I must explain.

Where I live, which is in Iceland, it happens that there have evolved two kinds of rulesets so to speak.

One set is pretty much the legislative and liability kind. Violating those rules only have legal kind of consequences most often enforced through social constructs such as courts.

The other set is more of ""DO NOT GO BEYOND THIS POINT AS THE CLIFF IS BRITTLE AND CAN GIVE AWAY UNDERNEATH YOU"" kind. Consequences of violating these are not metered out by any human or social construct but by nature and physics. 

The thought trap is that many equate the two as the same when they are not. The former is often just at the whim of a ruler or other legislating institution. The second is most often due to that we are depressively-tired of scraping up dead or crippled tourists that think it is okay to violate them.

Nobody thinks that any drug dealer is a hero for providing a market for potentially ""cleaner"" drugs(although cleaner is better than cut, yes) Instead, I think most people would agree that rather than punishment being the sole means of dealing with drug offenders, if you gave them a chance to rehabilitate, they would. I have many acquaintances in engineering who were lucky enough to have the means to rehab themselves. Now they are productive members of society doing great things. If our only recourse was to lock everyone up, we'd have a lot people costing tax payers a lot of money, a lot more fatherless kids/struggling families, and the cycle would only continue.

"I usually don't care about Ross (yeah, sorry the earth is pretty big), but did you even take a look at the link you are commenting on? 

Guy was only convicted for creating a website, for 2 life sentences without parole. Psychos who actually murdered people get less. Did you ever see somebody who created a robber mask go into prison? So many of them are used by criminals! And it's really hard to make an argument for the trial being fair. It's marketing. ""Don't fuck with us"". He is being sacrificed to scare others. Not exactly in the way that law should work? Who cares, everybody involved in taking him down gets a medal and a pat on the back. 

I'm not saying he's innocent, but I hate that so very often guys that really did not really harm others get crazy sentences only because it's something that thy system is afraid of. It's the same story with ""hackers"", ddosing, or a guy who cut a cable to the datacenter.

Meanwhile actions of many high political figures, bankers or other gov officials that directly harm lifes of others go without any punishment whatsoever.

It pretty much always was the case. The system always has flaws. But it was done behind the scenes. Because otherwise people would riot. But nowadays, so much of this stuff is out in the open. All these leaks and *-gates. Few comments on reddit with rage and we move on, ""what are you gonna do"". This is going in some very dark dystopian direction.  To end on a positive note, Bitcoin is a step in the opposite direction. And it's getting less and less fragile.

"There’s actually quite an interesting debate.  Not about Ross per se, that mofo is gonna die in prison 

The fascinating thing for me is that the idea for the  “hit” was proposed by an undercover law enforcement officer who was posing as a “fixer” / drug lord on Silk Road 

And the target was someone that the same law enforcement officer was currently in custody of, and the law enforcement officer was feeding false information through the informant 

So to summarize.  The undercover agent flips the informant , pretends to be the informant to draw Ross out of hiding, then the agent suggests under a different alias that Ross should kill the informant and that the agent will do it himself if Ross pays him.  Ross agrees and then the agent fakes the death and Ross gets charged for conspiracy to commit murder 

Oh and another fun fact. That same agent playing all sides stole 6-figures of bitcoin (now would be worth millions) from the Silk Road when he was undercover and is now currently in jail.

—-
The interesting thing to me is that this case sets precedent that I’m not sure we want. 

This case is like if a DEA agent became your best friend.  Ride or die pal.  And then he said, hey bro, will you hold onto this kilo of cocaine for 24 hours.  I’m gonna meet up with you later. 

Then when you get on the road, the same guy hops in an unmarked police car and starts riding your ass.  Driving super aggressively.  So you tried to speed up to get away and then all these police cars pull up to you and arrest you for speeding then use probable cause to search your car and then you get arrested for cocaine possession. 

Is Ross Ulbricht a dumb shit that deserves to die in jail? Probably...who knows.  The jury thought so and the court of public opinion seems to agree so we’ll have to take it at that. 

—-
The questions that still remain to be answered, and ones that I hope get answered in our lifetime are: 

- Why was this case not entrapment? 

- Why did the fact that the undercover agents were found to be corrupt get hidden from the jury during trial?  Would that have impacted the verdict? 

- At a technical level, how did the FBI access the Silk Road servers in Iceland?  No sysadmins / network experts believe in the FBI’s telling of the story 

- Last but not least.  Where the fuck did the 700,000 bitcoin go that was in the Silk Road wallets?  Literally no one knows.  The gov’t auctioned off 40,000 btc and there are still BILLIONS of dollars worth of bitcoin that are missing.

But even if you believe Ross ordered 6 people killed, that's far, far fewer than the number of people ordered killed by Nelson Mandela. There's hardly any debate about who Mandela was, but the lack of debate is on exactly the wrong side.

So what I'm saying is: even if you believe the worst about Ross, Ross Ulbricht is a much better person than Nelson Mandela. If Nelson Mandela can be considered a hero and an icon, then so can Ross Ulbricht.

"Yep. It was tossed around during the trial to bias the jury (the prosecution even *literally* said that’s what they were doing), but no actual charges were brought or could have been proven.
