The intention of the framers is irrelevant; the constitution is its own entity that has a status separate from the ideals of your 'founding fathers'.

"**National debt of the United States**

The national debt of the United States is the amount owed by the federal government of the United States. The measure of the public debt is the value of the outstanding Treasury securities at a point of time that have been issued by the Treasury and other federal government agencies. The terms national deficit and national surplus usually refer to the federal government budget balance from year to year, not the cumulative total. A deficit year increases the debt because more money is spent than is received; a surplus year decreases the debt because more money is received than spent.

The federal government is not legally able to retain property seized as part of a criminal investigation once the trial has finished and a verdict has been rendered. Unless the evidence would be admissible in an appeal or retrial it has to be auctioned off, by law. So no it's not a financial mistake, it is the government abiding by the rules they set forth. If they did not follow those rules an injunction could be filed against the federal government and there would have been a legal battle over the bitcoins.

"> The thing is this was a boon for us. The bitcoin community. It was the first sign that governments treated Bitcoin as somethibg of value.

It really wasn’t. The government has to auction all criminal assets at the conclusion of the trial. They would have done the same thing if the object in question was a rusty pickup truck with a bed loaded with jars full of toenail clippings.

It doesn’t mean the government sees jars full of toenail clippings as something of value. It just means there’s rules in place that mandate they sell seized assets at the conclusion of a trial.


On the other hand, it is true that coiners tend to act on things imagined as much as things that are real.

"This makes no sense, in order for the us government to redeem value from a bitcoin they have to introduce new money into the market to pay for the bitcoin. You cannot reduce the debt by introducing new money, you would simply grow the debt and expound the problem if the us government started buying or selling bitcoin. 

Fiat currency does not operate in the same method for the us government as it does for a singular citizen, and the analogy of home finances used broadly across the internet to simplify national budgets is a flat out incorrect analysis.

The only way that the us debt disappears is if something like bitcoin were to replace fiat based currency, but that is highly unlikely and an extremely naive approach to economics and the idea of debt backed currency in the first place.
