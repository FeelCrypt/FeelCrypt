As I said, if you got paid in USD and one day you could buy a loaf of bread for $1, but in two weeks you could buy 4 loaves of bread with $1, and in a month a loaf of bread cost $5. Now think how this would apply to bigger ticket items like a house or apartment.  What if your monthly rent could fluctuate 50-100% monthly.

">invest in startups

Hmm I have been trying to implement a platform to do exactly this since last year. Although the major hurdle is how would you make sure the investor gets the returns? How would you go about the legal process to grant this African guy his equity? How can he ask for the dividends if you start screwing him up from US (in this hypothetical case)? If it's loaned, how can he collect interests?

It's not easy at it sounds. If you have a solution on these problems, hit me up. Because people are trying from allover the world to make sustainable equity crowdfunding platforms but the industry is still not booming as much in third world. What you said works best only in UK & EU. It's still nascent in US & seen as too risky in other parts of the world.";2;2;False;;dwgkx04;Bitcoin's popularity in Africa continues to soar.

"It really depends on where you live. I was in Northern Zambia last year, astonishing 4G network thanks to Chinese infrastructure investment, but most people are walking and cycling for up to eight hours to buy food from the markets and don't have running water or electricity at home. Men work one to four days travel away from the subsistence farms their wives run to feed the children, motorised transport is extremely rare for the majority of people not from a tribal elite background.

Phones are restricted to the few with good jobs (<$100 USD per month), and even then you're talking about iPhone 3G era handsets or cheap 3G feature phones (cheap meaning a months wages). These people are so poor they are risking their lives poaching Puku with [homemade guns](https://imgur.com/a/4LV8S) for food.

"In short, lightning network works like a centralized Network.
Like PayPal, it relies on a central entity in order to mediate transactions and make sure that they are accurate.

However, that Central entity is actually the blockchain, something that everyone can trust, because it is decentralized.

Basically, it uses the blockchain as a court system, because blockchain is basically infallible and impossible to hack or cheat for all practical purposes. If we both have a dispute over the balance, then we can submit a transaction. The person who is correct gets all of the money in both sides, such that there is no reason for someone to try and submit a fake transaction, knowing that they are going to lose all of their money doing so. 

At the end of the day, lightning network is secured the same way Bitcoin is. I'm making it so expensive to try and hack someone, that in the tiny chance that it does succeed, it's not worth it. Bitcoin is hackable, if the eight richest people in the world pools their money to buy hashing power, they could fuck the network up for only 850 billion dollars. But they'd not gain anything from it. Lightning network is the same effect, it's just not worth it by any means, because you'd have to crack the ""judge/court"" which is the blockchain. This allows lightning Network to be extremely fast, like a trusted system, but still secure. It's trusting the blockchain, which is trustless. This is why it's called a second layer, because it is adding a layer on the Bitcoin, using the security of bitcoin's blockchain as a foundation, and using. In order to trust so that it can be very quick without having to trust each other.";1;1;False;pilotavery;dwghsis;⚡ Hackers tried to steal funds from a Lightning channel, just to end up losing theirs as the penalty system worked as expected;875avi;https://twitter.com/alexbosworth/status/978069194385252352
"Correct, you submit an on chain transaction to initiate the close, and fees are reimbursed to you from the unresponsive person's Ln Channel, which incentivises them not to go offline or be unresponsive 

So I can actually merge a channel open and a transaction at the same time. So let's say I want to buy something from you. I'm going to pay you anyway, so I can pay you and also open a channel at the same time. I set the timeout to 3 months. This means that if there are no transactions between us or routed between us for 3 months, the channel will close. Every time we do a transaction, that time is reset. We both can mutually agree on a timeout period. 3 years works pretty well, but so does a week since it resets with each transaction. We both ALSO specify a Lock period, which is separate. Let's say we set the lock period of 3 days. 

If all of a sudden, you want to close the channel, you can specify a soft close, in which you send me a signed transaction with our current balances, and if I agree it's correct, I sign it and send it back (also submitting myself if I want, but it doesn't matter) which means the channel will close in a single block confirmation, and then I get my money, and you get yours. 

If you ask me to sign the closing transaction, and I refuse, or I am offline and don't do it, you can do a ""force channel close"" which is locked without the peers key, to the pre-set lock period. We set it to 3 days (well it's based off block height). 

Now because YOU forced the channel close on ME, I must pay all transaction fees for both sides since it's my fault I was unresponsive, and it comes out of my own LN balance (until it's zero, then the rest of the blockchain fee is yours). What happens though, is that you could have submitted an old signed transaction that shows you have more. Now there is a 3 day wait period. 

Now if I come online and see 1 day left in the timeout, I have 2 options. I can either ignore it and let it close on it's own, or I can sign the close transaction in order to unlock both of our funds. 

If I come online and I see that you submitted a fake transaction, I can actually submit my own transaction (proving that there is a later transaction) and then I would get all the funds on the channel, yours and mine. This means even if I go offline, you won't submit a fake transaction unless you're 100% sure that I will not come back online. 

The time lock is just to give me some time to ""take it to court"" if it's wrong. If we both submit different states, whoever has the later transaction will get the enitre funds in the whole channel, instantly too!

Now, I know it's not perfect. If someone went offline, you would have a 3 day waiting period before you can move those funds, but the other person would actually be on the hook for all fees, which incentivises the peer to close the channel when requested. 

If I go offline temporarily, for only a week, there is the possibility that you can submit a close with an old transaction, which means you're trying to scam me. But you don't know for sure I won't come back online. If I come online for 1 second within that time out, my wallet is going to immediately submit a transaction as a penalty and get all your funds. 

Lastly, I can also request a Lock time increase, and you can either agree, or close the channel. If I know that I only have internet once a month, I might set the time lock to 40 days. You may not be willing to open a Channel with me in this case, unless I have a lot of funds at stake so they are sure I won't abandon it. 

If you have two channels open, you can actually move funds from one channel to another without even using the blockchain, which is also new.

The BOLT reference protocol is much different than the original lightning proposal, especially with atomic transactions, which let's me send 10 BTC to someone THROUGH you, even if you have only 1BTC. This was not possible previously, but now, the wallet apps can just send signatures abck and forth 10 times so that I can send 1BTC at a time, you rebalance, then I keep sending one at a time, until it's complete, even if you didn't have 10 BTC available. It's also called Atomic, because it either succeeds or fails, with no partial sends. It's not possible for you to send the first 4/10BTC then stop, that would render the receiving end invalid, which means no money would transfer. It's all or nothing. 

All of the previous pitfalls of lightning Network, such as requiring your funds to be locked up, or requiring your peers to have significant balance in order to route your transactions, have actually been solved with the BOLT standard. Unfortunately, it is more complicated than the initial implementation. For example, sending a lightning transaction would only use about 1.2kb of data, and now it uses almost 2kb+128 bytes per hop. It's not a big deal to most people, but the bandwidth usage is higher.
This means that people in rural areas with very slow internet would not be able to run a hub or a well connected node. If you only had a 1mb connection, you used to be able to handle a few hundred Ln Transactions per second, but now it's only about 60. 

On the plus side, it's much more flexible, and has almost none of the pitfalls of the original lightning Network proposal.

"> Lightning network is quite brilliant, really. Basically, LN doesn't really have an inharent security, but piggybacks off the blockchain for disputes only, with a fine/court system (controlled by the blockchain). Brilliant. 

Lightning channels are cool, but the network isn't. Let me ask you a few questions

Do you realize most people in the US do not have savings and live paycheck to paycheck? 

How would the LN work for them as they cannot afford to lock up money in more then one channel? Every purchase they make would go through a single source. That has serious privacy issues.

Do you realize that becoming a highly connected hub will be too expensive for the average user and this will be reserved for entities like banks? You will need to route your payments through them. What happens if they suddenly decide to only route payments that are unencrypted?

The security of Bitcoin comes from the miners. By moving transactions and fees off chain you reduce the incentives for miners and thus decrease the security of Bitcoin.

">Why would you ever open a channel with a 1 year n-lock timeout fee?

You would know this is you ever ran the numbers. You should do this as you would learn a lot.

I won't open a channel that long as I will not use BTC. I came here for Bitcoin and since BTC no longer believes Bitcoin works, I switched to BCH so that I can continue to send Bitcoin payments for the foreseeable future. 

But.. To answer your question, you would open channels with 1 year time locks because fees would demand it. With global adoption (7 billion) and 1 meg block size (4 meg weight), you will need multiple year time locks and that is if BTC is only used for opening and closing transactions. I'm using would rather then will because BTC will never become mainstream with this model.

Why would you ever open a channel with a 1 year n-lock timeout fee? Just like why would you send a 10 bitcoin fee with a transaction? It makes no sense. Solution? Don't open a channel with that high n-lock time. Make it like, IDK, a week. You can still have the channel open for 100 years, or 5 years, because the timeout is different than the N-lock time. N-lock time is the delay between you FORCING a channel closed, and it closing. 

>I don't need to ask anyone to send my Bitcoin for me.

Yes you do, you must ask the node to propagate the transactions and the miners to mine, by paying them to do so with fees.

>How do you know what a hypothetical hub knows? Even if we assume they won't be able to force KYC compliance, which is doubtful, there are many mathematical tools that analyze traffic. It is almost a guarantee that the hubs will be able to determine if they are your only access to the LN

Yep, just like in theory, I can figure out your address and social security number from here. It's just not feasible.

>I thought the entire purpose of restricting the block size was to make sure it was too expensive for me to do that. 

What? No, you can move your money from one channel to another without using the chain, with a fee between 1 satoshi and -1 satoshi.

>Your math breaks down here. You won't open channels with 10 satoshi as on chain fees would make the closing transaction more expensive then 10 satoshis. Stop using current fees and start using realistic future fees. Either you are playing stupid or intentionally attempting to deceive. Which is it? The fee market is a 'feature' in btc that will ensure all of this math is wrong.

Edit: also you cannot open that many channels. 10,000,000,000,000,000,000 is more then the maximum number of satoshis that will exist

In case this was not clear, I was making a point. 

>How much would you need to make to put that much money at risk? Hackers are going to make so much fucking money it will be stupid.

Why keep bitcoin in a wallet, it can be hacked? /s

>Lol. Yeah you can. Include a message explaining exactly what the payment is for or I won't route it can be very effective.

Then NOBODY WOULD USE THAT HUB! They'd lose all transaction fees and everyone would close their channel, getting their money back after the n-lock time if they didnt cooperate. 
Besides, nobody COULD use the hub that required that, because wallets don't support sending messages like that. So no, dude. Or I will just type in ""Reasons"". Not no, it's encrypted either way, in that the hub can't see who it's from or to. The hub can't require a note to send it anyway, because they can't expect you to know, because they don't know the difference between you sending and you routing. 




>Onion routing was designed to have the start point change every time you log in. Using the same start point each time reduces the security 

You are thinking of TOR routing. Onion Routing simply means that it's encrypted in a way that each node doesn't see where it's source is, it only sees the amount, and who to forward it to next.

Yeah, much of your text is built off of misunderstandings. Let me know if this clears it up, or what is unclear enough that you need me to explain further.

Otherwise, it's not worth my time. I have about .4BTC on LN at the moment, because I understand why it is safe, and nobody has had funds stolen so far yet.

"> Very good questions, but they are based off a misunderstanding of the network’s protocol

I could say your lack of concern of the inherent problems of LN comes from a misunderstanding of it's 'features'. Let's avoid these attacks as they are not productive.

>Why would there be an issue ""Locking"" in more than one channel? Is there an issue ""Locking"" funds into a standard bitcoin wallet? 

Come on now. You aren't that naïve. This is a ridiculous comparison. I don't need to ask anyone to send my Bitcoin for me. If I had my money locked up in a single channel, then only one entity could route my money. If they go offline, get a government order to freeze my money, ..  Then I can't spend it until the channel times out, which I suspect will be a year at least. 

Locking funds in a wallet is what made the Dao possible. Too few people realized how much that single action threatened all crypto.

>LN works similarly to BTC. You can move money from one channel to another off the blockchain, between your channels, in a triangle. 

More like an octogon. That's nothing like BTC, it is, however, exactly how banks currently work. Again this is a problem Bitcoin solved. No middleman each taking a fee. I guess it sounds good if you expect to be someone taking that fee.

> If you want to send to a legacy BTC address off the LN channel, you can do a SINGLE ""Top up"" to take funds out of the LN channel and broadcast right to the other person, or a single transaction back to the channel.

You can ask your hub to help you send a single transaction you mean? They have to approve the transaction

>It isn't any different than having a dedicated wallet just to buy things, and leaving all funds in it. 

What type of wallet do you mean? I only use deterministic wallets and recommend the same to others. Keeping all of my money in a single address has privacy concerns. A deterministic wallet spreads your money into many accounts. That is vastly different then a single channel

>If you can't afford $1 to leave in each channel, just stick to Fiat. 

I thought we were trying to free the world from fiat. This used to be money for everyone, when did it become only for those that can afford it? I want the people in the poorest countries to be able to use Bitcoin

>Just keep $1 minimum in each channel, which is about the most you’d be required to lock up

come on now. Really? Is your memory limited to weeks? I paid $100 for a single transaction not long ago. This is with minimal adoption. To be fair there were many inputs. You keep ducking my question about global adoption as you know that is where LN breaks down. Its great if fees stay low, but limiting the block size does exactly the opposite. BTC will have $100 fees again, there is only so many transactions that you can fit in 1 meg even with optimization, and LN requires on chain transactions. Global adoption by my math requires gigabyte blocks. The Core devs will never support that.

>Also, even if all your transactions go through a single source, the peer DOESN’T KNOW that you are the only source. It’s source routed. 

How do you know what a hypothetical hub knows? Even if we assume they won't be able to force KYC compliance, which is doubtful, there are many mathematical tools that analyze traffic. It is almost a guarantee that the hubs will be able to determine if they are your only access to the LN

Your math breaks down here. You won't open channels with 10 satoshi as on chain fees would make the closing transaction more expensive then 10 satoshis. Stop using current fees and start using realistic future fees. Either you are playing stupid or intentionally attempting to deceive. Which is it?

*Edit: also you cannot open that many channels. 10,000,000,000,000,000,000 is more then the maximum number of satoshis that will exist*

I don't care how many channels you have open, I care about how many useful channels. If you have 10 satoshis, it isn't useful period. Do real numbers on how much it would cost to open useable channels. Even without the fees we are looking at at least a grand per channel. 1000 channels is a million dollars. Remember this is a million dollars in hot wallets. How much would you need to make to put that much money at risk? Hackers are going to make so much fucking money it will be stupid.

"Very good questions, but they are based off a misunderstanding of the network’s protocol and functionality. Why would there be an issue ""Locking"" in more than one channel? Is there an issue ""Locking"" funds into a standard bitcoin wallet? Of course not! What if you “Lock” funds into a Segwit wallet? Of course not! If you have funds in a LN channel, or in cold hard storage, and want to spend it to a legacy address, both of them are the same, in that I can spend it with a single on-chain transaction.

LN works similarly to BTC. You can move money from one channel to another off the blockchain, between your channels, in a triangle. Your wallet app actually manages all the channels, so you just scan and go, it takes care of it. If you want to send to a legacy BTC address off the LN channel, you can do a SINGLE ""Top up"" to take funds out of the LN channel and broadcast right to the other person, or a single transaction back to the channel.

It isn't any different than having a dedicated wallet just to buy things, and leaving all funds in it. If you can't afford $1 to leave in each channel, just stick to Fiat. Just keep $1 minimum in each channel, which is about the most you’d be required to lock up. Also, even if all your transactions go through a single source, the peer DOESN’T KNOW that you are the only source. It’s source routed. They don’t know if you sent/received, if you’re a hub, or if you happen to be routing other transactions. 


My cell phone can run a hub with about 3,500 connections. Not terribly expensive, a laptop would do, or a VPS for $4 a month. As for hubs? Because you can send money between each channel off chain, you’d be fine. Both parties can agree on a minimum balance, and if the hub has a policy that they always leave their side empty, then that’s just something that the users could/would agree to. I mean, I may not want to open a channel with less than 10 satoshi, but I would be fine with it.
If I have 10,000,000,000,000,000,000 channels open, I could run a hub with $1000 worth of bitcoin. That just means I can only route a MAXIMUM of $1000 at a time. That’s it. I can have a hub “I only will process transactions up to $1,000”. I’d do this by routing a transaction, then moving those funds from that channel to another to route again, then moving it and doing it again, over and over. Since it is off the chain, there is no issues. Of course, this is slow, and I would only be able to handle about 250 transactions per second, but if I double the funds I have, or reduce my max transaction size in half, I could increase this. In reality, I can charge higher fees for larger transactions (3 satoshi for anything over $1,000 worth) and then move all funds to one channel to process it.

Actually, because LN has Atomic multipathing, it would be possible for a hub to process a 10BTC transaction with only 1BTC, it would take 10 times as long. Or 100BTC with only 1 satoshi, which could take an hour or two (unrealistic, but my point is it’s possible)>

Running a LN node doesn’t really cost much. Next to no CPU power or electricity, no expensive hardware (A smartphone can do it) and doesn’t require a high capital. In practice, a hub with 200 channels would want at least $30 in it, to process transactions up to about 300 per second without bottlenecks or backlogs. 

The way LN works, you CAN’T route unencrypted transactions. They would break the protocol and be invalid. It’s routed by wrapping the transaction in encryption from the destinations private key, and wrapping that with the destination public key into another layer with the one before that, and works backwards. It’s called Onion Routing. It means that transactions are ALWAYS encrypted, and any hub is unable to tell if you are sending, if you are routing, or even how many hops it took before and after. Hell, it doesn’t even know if it’s sending to the destination, or just routing back to your other channel to balance it! 

If they decide to not route your transactions, or decide that they won’t without requesting information, you can submit a closing transaction on them, or just refuse to use them. Unlike ISP, the network doesn’t depend on geographic location.
