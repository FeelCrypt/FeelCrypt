">You only sell in a bear market if you are a good day trader or an illusioned noob. --- DTCxDASH, [creator of the term 'HODL'](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=375643.0)

The whole purpose of HODLing is to avoid selling prematurely.

*Someone who is purely a trader, or purely a gambler---someone without any understanding of or attachment to the underlying asset---hasn't even the theoretical capacity to hold all the way to the moon.* 

Any disciplined trader will either have already set a sell target before even making the trade or will exit the trade upon making what they consider to be a reasonable profit based on their analysis. Similarly, any gambler will eventually cave to FUD as there is no such thing as a crypto that only goes up. Neither the pure gambler nor the pure trader has the capacity to hold long term. 

Only the hodler has the theoretical capacity to hold from 30 cents to 30 million dollars because to be a hodler means to have become convinced in the underlying value of the asset and what that value will eventually be. 

That isn't to discount those traders who are fundamentally hodlers and yet trade to supplement their hodling. It is just to say that very few non-hodlers---people who have no faith in the value of the underlying asset---will ever do as well in crypto as hodlers, they simply lack the ability not to sell prematurely.";6;0;False;Ilogy;e1687zz;Don't be like Greg;8t9c6d;https://i.redd.it/7iu2c1vckq511.png

It was my rainy day fund, and was purely holding on to them just for fun(never thinking they'd end up being worth what they are now). I figured id cash them out and maybe get 500 to a couple grand. I mined most of them, bought/given some, and won a few in contests. I eventually combined them all in my Mt Gox, i had them scattered accross different wallets, so i thought massing them in one online wallet, was securest option. <.<  So after that happened, i just gave up on bitcoin.

I know they have some legal action against them now, but i know people who had far more BTC in Mt Gox then me. So i doubt any legal actions that re going on right now, would include me? ...
