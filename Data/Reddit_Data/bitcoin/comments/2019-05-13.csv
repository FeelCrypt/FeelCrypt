By it's very nature it is impossible to stop people who really want to use Bitcoin. It is decentralized, it is protected from people just like this for this exact reason. Just like the war on encryption, it is an idea. It is a Pandora's box that was already opened. The source code is public, can be read/viewed/used by anyone anytime anywhere in the world. If you're scared about them 'banning' crypto, you can always just put it on a paper wallet and put it in cold storage and be fine. They cannot ban pieces of paper!;1;0;False;LovesPenguins;endd12m;Today in Congress Rep. Sherman called for a bill to ban all cryptocurrencies.

Man, taxes are hell

I imagine every year I'm gonna have like a 200 pages thick tax form detailing every last $0.25 lollipop I bought";1;1;False;;enbho5m;$6k Bitcoin like..;blreid;https://v.redd.it/b3umbva2vsw21
"You can't claim losses on crypto unless you sell it, even if it goes down in value. If you buy 1 bitcoin in January 2020 at $10k (making prices up here for an example), and by the end of the tax year it is $5k, but you cannot claim $5k losses unless you physically sold it. Bitcoin is no different than stocks in this way. Another example would be if you bought 1 BTC at $10k in January, it dropped to $5k in the middle of the year, but rose to $15k at the end of the year. If you sold in the middle then you can claim $5k losses, if you sold at the end then you must claim $5k gains.

&#x200B;

The IRS doesn't acknowledge it until it changes form. I.e. if you, at the end of that same year, trade the BTC for ethereum or litecoin, you will have made a transaction and you can claim gains. (Gains in this case being equivalent to how much your USD value of said asset changed)

&#x200B;

I don't know about obtaining it through other means. I would imagine if you ran a business and were receiving BTC for goods then you would be taxed as that would be income. But as far as something much less common, like say if I were to walk my friends dog for $10 of BTC, that's probably income and you would probably be taxed immediately. But again I'm not sure on this.";2;1;False;banditcleaner2;enbhb7m;$6k Bitcoin like..;blreid;https://v.redd.it/b3umbva2vsw21

"Yes, taxes are hell indeed.
That being said, crypto taxes are especially worse. Honestly, though, (and I may eat my words for this), it's insane what tax services charge for crypto traders. At least for me, I had only done probably 50 or so trades in all of 2017. There's only one form that you have to use to file crypto taxes, and for small amount of transactions, it doesn't take that long. Yet they charge anywhere from $150 (<100 transactions) to $1000 (as much as 2000+) extra.

I'm a programmer and I considered making a program to fill out the form for me, just as a fun project. Could be useful.

I did my taxes manually this year to save that money, and I'm well glad I did. I'm considering keeping that form saved on my desktop and everytime I do a trade, logging it on that form so that next time tax season comes around I just have it already done pretty much.";1;0;False;banditcleaner2;enbi14e;$6k Bitcoin like..;blreid;https://v.redd.it/b3umbva2vsw21
