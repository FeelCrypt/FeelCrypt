I would say of investments that have been around 10 years, Bitcoin is probably one of the most risky, and the most rewarding. I mean without leverage. Its just nothing like stocks or real estate, it does its own thing. They call it pure TA, since there is no earnings or rent to confuse the issue. I try not to chase momentum, but that is a valid strategy as well, but it might leave some money on the table, since the long term performance of Bitcoin as been one way.;2;0;False;HODL_monk;et026aq;Classic;c9gztr;https://i.redd.it/9pk3f6023i831.jpg

First time I heard of bitcoin it was $75. Thought it was expensive back then and carried on partly because I could not understand the whole concept behind it. Then you see the huge price movements and it starts getting your attention. Hind sight is always 20/20 though. Guess it's a matter of beleiving or not. If the trend is to continue it can easily go to 100k and more from here so even at 11k is worthed.

"It's smart, you never invest based on price on those speculatory assets, you invest based on sentiment.

You couldn't be cognizant of those facts before they were even to happen. What if the interest rates were to go up? What if we had greater stability?

Buying at $4k in the way down is far stupider than buying at $10k in the way up because *at the time* you have no idea where the fall will stop (if you had bought at $4k), all the while buying at $10k after a bottoming pattern has completed and signs that a new cycle has begun makes much more sense.
