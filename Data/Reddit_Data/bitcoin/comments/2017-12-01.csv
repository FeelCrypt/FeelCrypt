"Yeah I think initially bitcoin won’t be used too much for anything other than a store of value. 

But there will be a point when the market cap is large enough that the volatility is no longer an issue (maybe when it’s a $2 trillion dollar market). At this point bitcoin will be useful for a lot more day-to-day transactions etc";1;1;False;LeeWallis;dqlcnph;It's official! 1 Bitcoin = $10,000 USD;7g9cd3;https://v.redd.it/e7io27rdgt001
"It’s a complicated question because it’s so unlike anything we’ve seen before.

I like to compare it to gold. Let’s break down the properties of gold.

Fungibility - High
Portability - Moderate
Durability - High
Highly Divisible - Moderate
Secure (can’t be counterfeit) - Moderate
Easily Transactable -  Low
Scarce - Moderate

Gold has a $7-$8 trillion dollar market, and is considered one of the best ways to store value around the world.

Let’s look at Bitcoin.

Fungibility - High
Portability - High
Durability - High
Highly Divisible - High
Secure (can’t be counterfeit) - High
Easily Transactable -  High
Scarce - High

You can move any fraction of bitcoin around the world in seconds, without anyone’s permission, without the use of a bank, and without having to physically move any object.

In addition, its:

- Not issued by a government
- Completely decentralized 
- Programmable 

It cannot be seized by anyone, unlike gold. You can store bitcoin as a memory and take it with you anywhere, unlike gold. You can store the same value in multiple locations, unlike gold. You don’t need to spend a lot of money to move it, unlike gold. The ledger of all transactions is public and accessible by anyone, unlike gold. There will only ever be 21M bitcoins, yet we can mine for more gold. Anyone in any country can buy/sell or send/receive bitcoin, unlike gold. 

When you look at it like this, it makes a very strong case for bitcoin being Gold 2.0. Why would you buy gold when you can store wealth digitally? 

Currently bitcoin is a $0.17 trillion market, compared to golds $8 trillion. So with some simple math we could work out that if more wealth was stored with bitcoin, the price of each unit will increase in value because of the limited supply.

For example,  if 5% of the gold market moved to bitcoin, that would make bitcoin a $400 billion market. Currently there are only 17,000,000 bitcoins, so $400B divided by 17M put the price per bitcoin at $23,529. 

Is it reasonable to think bitcoin could one day be a trillion dollar market? Sure it is.

Well 1 trillion divided by 17M would put the price per unit at $47,619.

So the question is, will people trust bitcoin and crypto currency to store their wealth better than alternatives? Well, they already are.

And we haven’t even touched on bitcoins utility yet and all the industries it can disrupt. This is just talking about one use (store of value).";0;1;False;LeeWallis;dqllmyt;It's official! 1 Bitcoin = $10,000 USD;7g9cd3;https://v.redd.it/e7io27rdgt001

"Bitcoin doesn't have any innate asset value, nor any future revenue streams. It's a currency, not an investment. You use it to buy and sell things, not to produce things.

If a company has $20 in assets and $10 in liabilities then I can establish a floor value of that company as $10 in equity alone. But let's say it also produces $1 in revenue each year. I can calculate the value of that annuity in today's dollars.

Add the two together and that gets my estimate at what the company is worth.

"> Fox has its biases, as well as a lot of independent news outlets, but...
> CNN broadcasts outright lies and propaganda, regularly and consistently.

I bet you didn't even see the irony in that statement. The subs you frequent allow screenshots of blogs as ""news"" submissions. They also endorse violence and derision towards minority groups. r/politics only allows submissions from verified news sources (you can take issue with the bias of a news company all you want, but at least they're more credible than blogs). They also haven't instructed people on how to run protesters down with their vehicles...but that's something t_D loves to pretend never happened (sort of like how a disturbing number of those users deny the Holocaust but secretly really wish it happened all the same)

Try getting your news from somewhere that isn't an alt-right cringe sub or even from reddit in general. Fox, Breitbart, InfoWars are toxic garbage; CNN is also trash but at least not state propaganda; WaPo leans but has been doing solid journalism since Watergate; few take issue with BBC but coverage can be lacking.

"Yes, and like the other reply that outlined the process mentioned .... there are a lot of steps. Especially when you compare investing here to investing in almost anything else. 

That also ignores the issue that if you’re not well versed in this, there are also a lot of different options for a lot of those steps. Which companies, or products, or sites to use for them is a huge question by itself, and especially as someone who has followed bitcoin for a long time but not actively participated, it’s really not that easy to keep track of which entities and companies are legitimate and “safe” to use to handle your money and which aren’t. The gold standard exchanges in 2010 are no longer the ones to use. Which wallet to use has changed. How you track and manage things has changed. Etc, etc. It just feels like I’m gonna fuck it up and get scammed cuz I don’t know better.

It feels kinda like how I imagine old people trying to find internet porn on their own or torrent movies on their own would go.

Owning shares in a company usually provides voting rights and other benefits. If dividends are paid out, then your voting rights do not change with an increase in company profits. If the company requires you to sell a portion of your share(s) to generate a profit equivalent to a dividend, then you are losing the power of the original share (I.e. percentage of ownership).

"First of all. Nothing has intrinsic value. Literally nothing. Intrinsic value of a cow? 2million calories or a divine creature? Intrinsic value of the dollhair? An aggressive government which can project violence anywhere on the planet but which could easily be disrupted by adversaries or from within?  

Gold has little industrial use since it is so brittle, silver could become more valuable if technology permits it. 

I guess you are new to the crypto space.

Tell me. In 50 years when we are hauling chunks of gold back to earth orbit, what will be the value of gold? Do you think we will find 'new' bitcoins on the darkside of the moon too? 

Using cryptography to ensure scarcity is brilliant. Arguably **infinitely** superior to metal chunks or rare gasses which are **infinitely** more available than bitcoin in this universe and which need more energy to collect and maintain.    

But sure you know everything about the btc and how it has no intrinsic value because we should all listen to you and say currency currency currency and not use it as a store of value instead I should primarily use it to pay for my rent. Sure. Hope it works out for you.

If some of the other shit we see in the alt coins can reach as high as they are then I can see a bright future for litecoin it's one of the only coin's I would consider, that and monero.

"I guess the issue most people have is that CC/PayPal/whatever fees are built into the cost of the item. If you pay for any transaction with Bitcoin the fees aren’t built in. So whatever it is, coffee, a t-shirt, it’s going to cost me as a customer more than it would otherwise. Transaction fees are also so variable. A year ago transaction fees were never over .50 cents. Now the average transaction fee has been up to $19. Where are you getting 40 cents? Maybe not *right this second* but for today the average transaction fee was $5. You say bitching like it’s fine and should just be ignored.

People keep changing the goal posts. Originally the general consensus was that bitcoin was going to be huge as a currency, and every retailer that implemented it was celebrated. I remember people talking about the future where you could walk in and order a coffee with bitcoin. Now your fees will cost more than the coffee. But this is going to discourage retailers from implementing it and customer from using it. You aren’t paying for a useful service. You’re paying a bitcoin tax for a service you can already do cheaper. 

Yes, solutions are being worked on. But for all these second layer solutions it’s still going to take a transaction fee to get your money into that layer. All that will do is save you fees if you are making multiple purchases within the same layer, so it’s pretty much the same problem, or worse because if you move money into that layer anticipating multiple transactions, but don’t use all the funds then you’ll have to pay *another* transaction fee to move it back into the main ledger.

"Yeah, just like Bitcoin there is a predetermined number of coins. They are indivisible. And you can buy a million IOTAs for about 1.30$ now. The huge number of coins is due to the business case of IoT and microtransactions (hence also why every transaction has zero fees), so machines can send very low amounts of money back and forth, for example to buy the data of a sensor.

The number of coins may seem huge, but when one puts it in comparison with Bitcoin, with its smallest division of 1 Satoshi, then IOTA only has something like 1.7 times as many coins.";6;1;False;jensZett;dqlp017;Almost everyone now is an Investor;7gonjk;https://imgur.com/nb33jRX

"Correct there is no mining, and hence no fees for any transactions. Instead of mining, each node that initiates a transaction must also verify two other transactions in return.

IOTA is not even based on a blockchain, it is based on a directed acyclic graph called the Tangle. It is conceptually similar to a blockchain but instead of growing in only one direction it grows infinitely in all directions. So theoretically the bottleneck that you have with Bitcoin and other blockchain-based currencies (where everyone has to vie for a spot in the new block added to the growing end of the chain) doesn't exist because any transaction can attach to any other transaction anywhere along the chain.

You can see what it looks like in real time at https://tangle.blox.pm/ or at http://live.iotaknot.com/

On the second one you can double-click a dot to see that transaction. Looks like a lot of them are 0 iota transactions right now, probably the result of spamming the Tangle which is done intentionally to speed up the network.";1;0;False;doc_samson;dqm7yx9;Almost everyone now is an Investor;7gonjk;https://imgur.com/nb33jRX
"I've never bother with any alt coin tbh, I did once have a stack of monero but sold those at around $5 to put back into bitcoin right before it decided to suddenly jump in value a lot. I only to take small positions in alts to trade certain  scenarios like a break of an ATH where you can make a few % and walk away. They are way too volatile and you could be waiting a long time for them to come back to their highs if they do drop. Crypto in general is volatile but at least with bitcoin your more than likely to reach the price you paid for it sooner or later. Bitcoin has pretty much doubled in 3 weeks and it has a solid fundamentals for a crypto. I wouldn't like to say buy it up now but who knows how far this run can go or where it will end, the higher the price goes the more people pile in which creates a feedback loop due to the scarce nature.

I would have thought that we need a serious correction before long to keep going up because this sort of growth is a little insane tbh. Just don't put more than you can afford to lose in it because it's already parabolic and there's a lot of fomo which is a little worrying, I would say wait for a dip but your probably better spreading your buys and cost averaging it and buying a little each week/month. I also really wouldn't ask people on reddit what to buy because your going to get biased answers for the coins that people are in but bitcoin will likely be the coin that still stands years from now unless something else comes along which seems unlikely. The best times to buy is when the media isn't talking about it and it's been going down for a while though not 2 years into the most bullish run in history. Sometimes it does just take off and never returns to those levels ever again though. You never know...

Amazon's only had one year where it jumped nearly 1000%, and that was 1998 when it jumped 966%. In 2000 it dropped 80% when the tech bubble popped, and then dropped 30% from *that* level in 2001. It nearly recovered from that, but then the Great Recession hit. It wasn't until 2009 that it finally returned to that same price from 1998 (adjusting for splits).;1;0;False;hfutrell;dqlk8z1;Almost everyone now is an Investor;7gonjk;https://imgur.com/nb33jRX

3. Bitcoin has been around for several years and has not been hacked, broken, etc.

"> Slow bleed leads to currency crisis as the expected value of bitcoins solidifies in people's minds. At first they are conservative, they invest ""what they can afford to lose"". After 12-18 months, their small stash of bitcoins has dramatically increased in value. They see no reason why this long term trend should reverse: the fundamentals have improved and yet adoption remains low. Their confidence increases. They buy more bitcoins. They rationalize: ""well, it's only [1 -5%] of my investments"". They see the price crash a few times, due to bubbles bursting or just garden-variety panic sales – it entices them to buy more, ""a bargain"". Bitcoin grows on the asset side of their balance sheet.

"Taxes are not the main driving force of demand on fiat money. Production is. If you know there's going to be more things produced tomorrow, you'll know that your dollar today will have more purchasing power tomorrow. The economy will demand more money until the utility in spending a dollar today is equal to the utility of spending a dollar tomorrow.

The debate for the value of bitcoin is one of its future utility. The increase of price is a reflection of the information explosion about bitcoin; more people know about it now so naturally more people demand it. It's not that the same population of people are buying more and more coin (though that is happening), it's that there are more people trading. People are banking on the hope that transforming their money into bitcoin today will allow them to purchase more in the future. Bitcoin, being the premier cryptocurrency, has *a lot* of promise for future utility. There is absolutely no doubt that it will be used in the future and we know that it's deflationary attribute will increase its settled, natural price. But is that natural price at $50k or $50? That's the big gamble....

I'd say skepticism is very healthy for the price of bitcoin. The more volitale and risky it is, the fewer idiots pouring their entire life savings into it. Those would be the idiots that would cause a crash. So let's calm down and be moderate... Bitcoin has always swung around 20% daily volatility.

"Amazon is trading at somewhere around 300 times current earnings. Shareholders must have a lot of faith in them to justify that premium. In my opinion the proliferation of alt-coins, forks, and ICOs as get rich quick schemes has inflated the BTC bubble as the reserve currency of crypto. The question is how will it pop. The volatility over the past few days indicates a market that is struggling to agree on a price. In healthy markets prices derive from something real or fundamental that is relatively independent of the price of the good itself. Numerous commentators have said that Bitcoin is going parabolic. That means its price growth is powering its own price growth. Essentially the price growth of Bitcoin is generating free money for hodlers from new dollars pouring in. Kind of like a Ponzi scheme. This can go on until Bitcoin eats the financial world, displacing traditional currencies, or until there is a very nasty correction triggered by any moderate sell of. I think that it is more likely that  bitcoin will suffer a correction rather than that it eats the whole global economy at an exponential rate over the next few years. There are too many vested interests in the current system. Maybe a state actor such as the NSA could create malware directed at bitcoin nodes, for example, etc, exchanges can be outlawed. Possession or trading criminalized. I don't support any of this but these are actions the existing system could take to protect itself from a rising Bitcoin. On the other hand maybe it is the Trump of Currencies and everyone will dismiss it but it will keep rising any way. The lack of maturity of many in the ""community"" disturbs me. They talk online like a bunch of teenagers. But on the other hand most detractors of bitcoin have not bothered to research it either. They routinely cast their judgements based on misconceptions of how bitcoin works or strawmen. An example of a strawman is ""gold has real world uses.""

"Is this not the case already???

Previous tax law has already ruled that you must pay capital gains tax on the fair market value, if applicable, when you barter swap a gold coin for a silver coin.  The IRS is going to gratuitously ass rape any crypto traders that have been doing this and not paying capital gains tax because crypto to crypto trades are not “like kind”. They already have their hands in the coinbase cookie jar and will make very public examples out of some big time traders before too long. This is why the long term buy and hold strategy is good in this area.

Bottom line is if you are making capital gains on any crypto to crypto trades it would be highly prudent to report them and err on the side of paying more tax than you should.

"Nullc, thank you for taking the time to respond to my post. There are no gods or kings in bitcoin, but in my mind you and few other core devs are as close as it gets. I have a lot of respect for you; so to have you of all people reply to my post is a great honor, and has forced me to reconsider my statement.

But I must stand by what I have said. You're right that bitcoin would not go quietly into the night if SHA256 is broken. There would be a great amount of FUD, infighting, turmoil, parties attempting to wrest control,  you name it. The technical problems this would create for you personally would be immense. But for me as a long term holder, it would just be another blip on the radar. The markets would crash and recover, and bitcoin the protocol would recover stronger than ever having passed another test.

For people entering the market now and people holding short term positions, there is an incredibly small (but still finite) risk that bitcoin cryptography could be broken. And this could affect them greatly financially. But for a long term holder like me, that risk does not exist due to the bitcoin protocol's anti-fragility.";1;1;False;Smittywerbenjagerman;dql09ri;Don't invest recklessly;7gi55s;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7gi55s/dont_invest_recklessly/

We routinely solve mathematical problems where a naive approach would take more than the lifetime of the universe, it's a question of knowing the right tricks.

An example of this is that you could compute a public key from a private key by sequential addition of the generator with itself, which would take 2^255 operations.  Fortunately we know faster ways to do it than the naive one or otherwise ECC wouldn't be usable.

"Good read but i think you're just being paranoid. Its very, very unlikely that bitcoin should fail anytime soon and even more so that failure being a total loss (meaning that it wont get replaced.). It's a well diversified coin that makes it almost impossible to coordinate an orchestrated dump. If the dump is unintentional and lasting then somewhere, something must have gone really really wrong in which case Bitcoin should be the least of our problems.
I think there should be plenty of time and numerous indicators that a crash is imminent. That should be even more obvious when it's about gradual replacement of the coin.
Really i just cant see a way where bitcoin fails and we dont have a shitload of time to pull out.

Unless you're one of those people that throws their money into something and remember to check up on their investment once every couple of years.

I dumped a couple thousand in and Ibam not choosey about where I do buy in at.  Could have at 9, 10 11 or anywhere in between.  But id youre going to wait for a specific number for a long term investment, youll never buy.  I am buying because there are a number of positive contributors right now.  NASDAQ futures, Accounting firms taking BitCoin.  more news attention to BitCoin and talk or regulation i see as a good thing (not regulation itself, but it gives it a bit of legitimacy).  Do not take these things as reasons why you should buy it... more of... have reasons to buy it.  I am in for a year.  I don't look to make huge profits, although tempting and nice to think about.  But I see things are much more positive and the current holding pattern we are in is healthy.

"I'm probably too late here for this to be seen, but I want to raise this point anyway because I think it's important and I haven't seen it talked about at all.

Many of us, myself included, are interested in bitcoin at least partially because of its deflationary nature.  But in the short term we're still years away from the point where new bitcoins are no longer being created.

It seems to be widely accepted that shocks to the wider financial system will be good for the price of bitcoin, similar to how gold has historically gone up in a crisis.  In my opinion, this should not be assumed - bitcoin did not even exist at the time of the most recent major crisis in 2008.  

The 2008 crisis [brought Madoff's ponzi scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madoff_investment_scandal) to the ground.  I raise this not to compare bitcoin to a Ponzi scheme, but to point out that one of the effects of a crisis would likely be that people want to sell off high-risk investments that are doing well to pay down debt.

For everyone who’s bought bitcoin at all time highs it’s worked out gloriously.  Each and every time. Go with your instincts and invest into cryptos liberally.  I doubt you will regret it. What you will like regret is taking advice from random nervous idiots (like the OP) who likely own very little, if any, bitcoin and feel the need to regurgitate the investing for dummies mantra as if he really gives a damn about you. My advice.  Go big or go invest in intel and General Electric. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity and if you follow OP advice you likely going to be buying in at 20k. Sure wait for a dip if you want.

">Taxes are not the main driving force of demand on fiat money. Production is. If you know there's going to be more things produced tomorrow, you'll know that your dollar today will have more purchasing power tomorrow. The economy will demand more money until the utility in spending a dollar today is equal to the utility of spending a dollar tomorrow.

The idea that supply creates its own demand is not [generally accepted by economists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_creates_its_own_demand), and it certainly doesn't work the way you're phrasing it. Even if I want a new PS4, I can buy it in Dollars or Bitcoins or Swiss Francs. I don't need dollars specifically. 

>People are banking on the hope that transforming their money into bitcoin today will allow them to purchase more in the future. 

Yes, they want to buy bitcoin with dollars so that they can sell it for more dollars in the future. The price goes up, so more people buy it in hopes of selling at a profit, which causes the price to go up. The price of Bitcoin can't go up infinitely, so eventually it'll stop growing, and the speculators will cash out, which will probably cause a crash. 

>There is absolutely no doubt that it will be used in the future

Of course there are doubts. There could be a market crash followed by all the speculators leaving forever. Dogecoin could become more popular (since it's *exactly as good.* There's *literally no reason* Bitcoin is the ""premier"" crytpocurrency except that it's more popular). Someone could discover a way to hack it. Growth could stall out. A million things can happen. Hell, if there's a recession, a lot of people will leave Bitcoin in search or more stable investments.

"Funny you should ask, because Bitcoin's real value right now is almost nothing.  It has enjoyed the advantage of being first to market, but there are FAR superior technologies nipping at its heels and it's only a matter of time until they get their turn.  Anyone who has actually tried using Bitcoin as a currency figures out REALLY fucking quick that having a public blockchain is a security and privacy **nightmare**.   The reason people don't seem to care is because almost all of the people who buy and sell bitcoin aren't actually *using* it, they're just traders who are speculating on its price.  They don't care whether it is actually useful as a currency, they just know they've made 800% gains in 2017.

Imagine if every time you went to the store the cashier could see your current bank account balance as well as a list of all the people you had ever given or received money from.    Seriously, think about that hard.  Think about whether you think that's something people are going to be excited about.  Of course not!!.  And yet, that's EXACTLY how bitcoin works.  Even so, everyone here just circlejerks about how great bitcoin is lol.  

Their logical minds are being completely clouded by the money they are making with bitcoin.  They are unable to see its fatal flaws or analyze the situation honestly and  critically.

Monero, on the other hand, IS completely anonymous, completely decentralized, and more closely resembles digital cash.  Open your mind and you will see that Monero is a vastly superior technology.  One day soon, maybe after the current bubble pops, people will be able to think rationally again and they will re-asses the crypto market.  They will realize that bitcoin is now just a dinosaur first generation novelty coin. There is then going to be a truly massive transfer of wealth from BTC into Monero.  The market cap of bitcoin is over 50 X that of monero... So what do you think is going to happen to the price of Monero when even a *fraction* of the wealth currently stored in bitcoin is moved into Monero?   It's going to grow exponentially.  

I guarantee it's going to happen.  It's only a matter of time.  

Before you let your mind get all upset and clouded with emotion because I dared to criticize bitcoin, take the time to thoughtfully consider what I have said.  Read about Monero.  Read about fungibility.  Why do you think that dark net criminals are completely unanimous about adopting Monero as their new standard currency?  These are the same people that saw the potential behind bitcoin and propelled it into public knowledge years ago.

"Okay I'm a bit late to the party and I might break the cirkeljerk, but I think we should pay attention to a few things. Also, I think cryptocurrencies are quite interesting, especially because of their limited supply.

1. So this graph talks about the money supply in terms of M1, while M2 is way more important for predicting inflation, because that is the actual money we use (this includes money created by commercial banks). See descriptions below. M1 is the stock of paper money that's in public hands. M2 = M1 + money created by commercial banks.

2. While growth in M1 and M2 are big and increasing, there is no inflation yet. But if inflation starts to increase the central bank could decrease the money supply by selling of the assets they bought. This way they decrease the money supply in the hope to limit inflation. 


MB: is referred to as the monetary base or total currency.[8] This is the base from which other forms of money (like checking deposits, listed below) are created and is traditionally the most liquid measure of the money supply.[12]

M1: Bank reserves are not included in M1.

M2: Represents M1 and ""close substitutes"" for M1.[13] M2 is a broader classification of money than M1. M2 is a key economic indicator used to forecast inflation.[14]

M3: M2 plus large and long-term deposits. Since 2006, M3 is no longer published by the US central bank.[15] However, there are still estimates produced by various private institutions.

">Bitcoin has been around for 8 years. Of course there is going to be some volatility. The peso is a failed currency, but it is a currency by your own admission. The difference here is that people didn't have a choice, whether it be in Venezuela, Cyprus, Ukraine, Argentina, or Zimbabwe as to what to use because the government had a monopoly on how people could usefully transact. That is obviously no longer the case, and this is one of the main contributing factors to Bitcoin's rise.

Bitcoin is currently not a good form of exchange. I didn't say it can't ever be used as currency - I just said it is currently bad currency with many investors not really treating it as currency. Bitcoin needs decades to stabilize into something that can actually achieve its original intended purpose. 

Yes, bitcoin may better than garbage currency or failing 3rd world currencies - but that's not saying much. In relation to those countries, it's the equivalent of buying gold when your country's currency is in free fall. You buy it to protect your assets, not because you want to use it as the new medium of exchange. 
Bitcoin is bad currency because of hyperdeflation - Argentinian peso is bad currency because of high inflation. 
It's not remotely better than any stable currency out there.

>At the end of the day, at the risk of sounding rude, (which I do not want to do) it doesn't matter what you think. Bitcoin is in use because it is useful to people. They are using it and therefore it is serving the effective functions of money regardless of how many breathless PhDs stammer on about how it cannot do this or that through the years.

At the end of the day, it doesn't really matter what you think either. I can't change the mind of millions of people and neither can you. But for you to keep replying to me, then it obviously matters to you what I think in context of this discussion and we're trying to convince each other of our points.

>Wait what? You are comparing a premined altcoin that is admittedly (by their own community) used mainly as a smart contracts fuel rather than a store of value or means to transact a more effective alternative to bitcoin? An altcoin that hardforks so often due to flagrant and capricious coding errors that it is getting hard to keep track?? You are incredibly... wrong.

Bitcoin's original purpose is to create e-currency. It has failed to do so for the most part so far. Bitcoin treated as an investment by the majority, not as currency. At least etherum is actually more successful in achieving its intended purpose, and thus has actual uses in addition to trying to be a way to store value and transact for goods. 

>Where can you spend Ethereum? I show you where you can spend bitcoin:

You literally just said give bitcoin some time because it is only 8 years old, yet you don't do the same for etherum? Bitcoin is 8 years old, while etherum is only 2 years old. Etherum has achieved in 2 years much more than what bitcoin has achieved in 2 years.

>Regulation doesn't matter in terms of the core usage of bitcoin. Bitcoin use is a free speech matter and therefore serves a litmus test for tyrannical governments.

You're missing the point. Having no government oversight presents plenty of problems. Do you really see no problems with a form of money having no regulation, oversight, government stabalization, etc

>Show me how you can teleport a hundred million mathematically verifiable in physical across the globe and have it confirmed delivery instantly, with further confirmations within the hour?

You mean like every other blockchain out there? Show me the majority of bitcoin owners keep bitcoin because they want to use it as money, rather than keeping it as an appreciating asset.

>Bitcoin is a perfectly fine medium of exchange, and it is also one that is subject to optimizations. 

Perfectly fine medium of exchanges don't have hyperinflation and hyperdeflation constantly changing its value by 10,000x over a few short years.

>Upgrading money. Now that's an idea that is disruptive.

Except Bitcoin isn't really successful as money yet. It's currently a speculated commodity with extremely volatile prices, in which some companies have accepted for bartering.";1;0;False;Intranetusa;dqml1nw;This Bitcoin chart is insane!

">""Yes, they are both assets. However, value is supply and demand. Inflation is volume. Of course they are connected, but not in the context you chose to explain. Your talks about competition are not related to this topic either.""

Value is also determined by perception of those factors. You can still create a bubble by creating the perception that something is demanded without significantly affecting real supply or demand. Look at the housing crash for example. A lot of communities had little to no construction of new houses (supply remained constant) yet their value still crashed non the less because they were overvalued based on perception.

>Only if you're day trading. Otherwise, no it doesn't...

You don't need to be a day trader to invest in something. How many people actually use bitcoins as currency? Do you think people would trade their bitcoins for pizzas if they thought it would go up 1000% in value a week later? No, they would hold on to it. 

>The fact that I can buy a currency that holds a variable value (like a stock or bond) instead of banking my cash so that banks can invest in a stock or bond means that crypto is very valuable! The fact that I can mine and earn dividends to compound my gains means that I have the power to grow personal capital and the banks do not. Once again, that is value my friend! Not to mention, it's global, carries lower fees and there is a finite amount.

I'm not saying crypto isn't valuable. Me and my friends have invested in crypto too. I'm saying crypto isn't actually useful as currency as long as people treat it as a continuously appreciating asset. Currency needs to be stable.

>Not to mention, it's global, carries lower fees and there is a finite amount.

Technically, the dollar can be traded almost anywhere on the planet. 
E-currency can potentially become infinite with creating of new e-currencies, forks and derivatives, etc. And having a finite supply of something used as money is not good for its use as money, as it can hold back economic growth. Finite amount of currency encourages hyperdeflation and hoarding of currency - thus defeating its purpose as a medium of exchange.

"I think you've never sat down and put pencil to paper on this. I challenge you to do so. Also, I think you're missing quite a bit of the nuance of what I'm saying. I'm only speaking within the context of living a comparable life to someone from 40 years ago, I'm not saying that that is what most people are doing though.

See below:

Without a college degree, a person in the US will end up averaging about $40,000/year throughout their life.

Using the criteria of the 60s and 70s, that's enough for a family of 4 to live off of. Considering all of the following:

1) one family sedan that only gets replaced maybe once every 7 years or so(and maybe by the 3rd one, the family keeps the old one as a second car. Maybe). 

2) 1600 square foot home(the average size in 1970). (In Akron, Ohio for example, that's currently a $65-$70,000 home)

3) no cable, modest internet(or no internet), and modest cell phones.

4) One spouse stays home all day doing the cooking and cleaning, one or both spouses do all or most of the home repairs themselves, the family eats out once a month, and only takes one vacation a year -- in the summertime to go camping, a national park, or the beach.

5) Weekly activities consist of Dad in a bowling/softball league, mom in a book club/PTA/Bible Study group, family goes to church once or twice a week, the kids do public school sports, maybe boy/girl scouts, and the family maybe goes to someone else's house once a week for dinner/drinks. 

This is the typical life of a middle class, one income family in the 60s and 70s. This seems like a no-frills lifestyle to people today, because there are so many more things to do and places to go. But one doesn't have to do other things to be middle class. 

Living the life of an average American family from 40 years ago is still easy on 1 income, even without a degree.

It's a limited form of deflation, though.  Several years back I was waiting to buy a certain size flat screen TV, don't recall the size now, but I wasn't willing to pay more than $300.  Prices kept falling and falling, but then they stopped and never hit $300.  The TVs got better and more features were added like ""3D"" or whatever, but I never got that TV.

Or, look at storage: hard drives, flash drives, RAM, etc.    At least in the new market there is a fairly established ""base"" price below which you'll never get anything.

"The first line was sarcastic. It's not a wise investment. There are plenty of things you can use money to invest in that will actually be worth more in 20 years. Money is a medium of exchange, you're not meant to keep hold of it you're meant to use it to exchange things you want for things other people want. If you want a store of value you can use money to buy it. Money doesn't need to be a long term investment, it needs to facilitate trade.

The 2nd line was a genuine question.

money only generates wealth by facilitating trade. If you bury money for 20 years it hasn't facilitated any trade and so it hasn't generated any wealth.

why should you be rewarded with greater purchasing power? If you want a functional currency you need to reward people for using money, not reward them for hoarding it.

If you have a currency that rewards people for hoarding it ceases to be used as currency, which is what happened to gold and is what is happening with bitcoin.

Complaining that you buried money for 20 years and it was worthless when you dug it up is like complaining you buried a sandwich for 20 years and it was worthless when you dug it up. Food is for eating and money is for trading.

Perpetual inflation is only good for the economy insofar as it encourages spending to pump GDP numbers. But it DOESN'T gaurantee any economic development. It DOESN'T prevent wasteful, frivolous spending. When money is deflationary, your spending and investment habits actually have to compete for the use of your dollars. Deflation will naturally occur when there is too much spending and too many wasteful investments. People will hold onto their dollars until an investment comes along that actually outperforms your dollar! See, nobody is looking at this problem in the correct way. Is hoarding *always* bad? No. Is spending *always* good? No. It DEPENDS on the contextual needs of the economy at any given time. That's why we used to see natural inflationary and deflationary cycles. Deflation isn't the problem. Its the corrective SYMPTOM of a mis-allocated economy. You can't cure the problem by suppressing the symptom.;12;2;False;Vladimus44;dqm0mah;This Bitcoin chart is insane!

"I'm not only refering to people not using bitcoins to buy stuff, but people not using bitcoins to invest in stuff. Let's say bitcoin goes up in value 20% every year. There is no point in investing in stocks, or a person who wants a loan to open a coffee shop if the rate of return is only going to be 5% every year. If people view bitcoins as an opportunity to make money, then bitcoin is not a medium of exchange but an investment in itself. 

That defeats the purpose of using bitcoins as currency - it becomes more like gold that is held to appreciate in value and then occasional used to barter for goods.

Deflation isn't a bad thing, but hyperdeflation is a bad thing because that means your currency isn't stable. Just like inflation isn't bad, but hyperinflation is bad. Bitcoin would be fine as currency if it was stable and went from $.01 several years ago to maybe $.05 today. However, when you go from less than $0.01 to $10,000 within 8 years, that is pretty bad to use as currency.

Look up tech and corporate adoption of etherum in exchange for block chain aided computing. Does bitcoin have that?


You are treating Bitcoin as a lump of gold - not as an actual medium of exchange. You spend the gold when you need it, but hold onto it because it's mostly an appreciating asset. People invest in assets, not in a medium of exchange - as that defeats the purpose of a medium of exchange. You use money to invest in other stuff, not money to invest in money itself. This would be pretty bad for the economy if people were encouraged to invest in the currency itself instead of using currency to invest in other things.

"Again, you're comparing apples and oranges.

40 years ago, an average single income family had one car, a 1600 square foot house, their kids didn't go to college, and cities like Akron, Flint, & Dayton were where most people lived. Families rarely ate out, only the rich had cablevision, and obviously there was no internet. Weekly activities included Dad's bowling league, Mom's book club, church twice a week, the kids played on the public high school sports teams, and the family took 1 vacation a year to go sit on the beach or camp in the woods.

It's still easy to live that life in those places on a single income, but people don't want that. They want 2-3 cars, they want 2600 square foot houses, they want to eat out every lunch and dinner, they want to send their kids to 4 year universities, they want to live in bigger cities than Akron or Flint, they want to take 3 or 4 vacations a year to Disneyland and the like, they want everyone to have a higher-end cell phone, cable TV, & Internet, and they want to hire someone to do all their housework, home repairs, and car repairs.

It's okay to want those things and have those things, but it's a more expensive lifestyle than what most people had 40 years ago. The expected middle-class lifestyle of today is essentially how the wealthy lived 40 years ago.

If you still want a modest house in Akron, with one family car, eat dinner at home every meal except special occasions, no cable, modest internet, good-enough cell phones, maybe send 1 child to community college, go to church on Sundays & Wednesdays, Dad with his weekly bowling league and Mom with her weekly bible study or whatever, that's fairly doable on 1 income.

"Shouldn't?  Based on what, sheer entitlement?

Housing prices snatched 60% of grandpa's earnings too.

But instead of whining about it, grandpa scrimped and scraped and saved up enough for a down payment and bought a modest house.  From then on, his housing cost no longer went up lock step w/ inflation, and every year after that, his cost of living raise improved his life just a tiny bit each year.

Many years later, they would treat themselves by going out to eat twice a week, instead of only going to the early bird brunch special after church on Sunday.  Oh, and they splurged on cable TV.   Although it was almost as prevalent as today in the late 80's, I never even had cable TV until maybe '96 or so.

Grandma used to tell a story at family get togethers about how, when they were first starting out and trying to make ends meet, they used to get a chicken every week at the market.  ONE chicken.  For the week.  First day, roasted chicken.  Second day sliced chicken sandwiches.  Third day, pick the meat off the bones and make creamed chicken sandwiches or chicken pot pie.  Fourth day, boil the bones and have chicken soup, Fifth day, left over chicken soup.

One week, the dog got hold of the chicken and was running around the yard with it.  She called her mother in tears becuase she was going to have to tell grandpa they had no chicken that week, and would have to eat rice and beans and whatever canned goods they had left. Her mother (great gramma, tho I never met her) told her 'You don't tell him a thing.  You take that chicken in the sink and you scrub the hell outta it.  Then you cook it just like nothing ever happened'

If grandma and grandpa had just bought whatever they wanted rather than sticking to their budget and saving what they needed to buy a house, why, they'd be just like people today, crying about how the man is keeping them down and how unfair it is that they can't have the things they think they should be entitled to.

Grandpa didn't win the IQ lottery.  He was a regular guy who worked at a utility as union lineman.  He didn't win any money, or get any handouts.  He was lucky enough to be working in the post war exapansion when union jobs were reasonably available, but even then, it was clear who was working class and who had money.

I try to remind myself from time to time to mine the lessons from grandmas life about what's important, what's a need, and what's just a spoiled want.  I'm glad this thread gave me an opportunity to revisit and refresh my perspective.

Imagine if it were not possible to build new housing.  If this were the case, housing prices would have continued to rise.

"> The Argentinean peso is failed currency. Nobody wants wild fluctuations in their currency. Hyper inflation (peso) or hyperdeflation (bitcoin) are both bad for currencies.

Bitcoin has been around for 8 years. Of course there is going to be some volatility. The peso is a failed currency, but it is a currency by your own admission. The difference here is that people didn't have a choice, whether it be in Venezuela, Cyprus, Ukraine, Argentina, or [Zimbabwe](https://assets.atlasobscura.com/media/W1siZiIsInVwbG9hZHMvcGxhY2VfaW1hZ2VzL2EwNDAyNTg5MmNjNWU0MGQ3NF9aaW1iYWJ3ZV8kMTAwX3RyaWxsaW9uXzIwMDlfT2J2ZXJzZS5qcGciXSxbInAiLCJ0aHVtYiIsIngzOTA-Il0sWyJwIiwiY29udmVydCIsIi1xdWFsaXR5IDgxIC1hdXRvLW9yaWVudCJdXQ/Zimbabwe_%24100_trillion_2009_Obverse.jpg) as to what to use because the government had a monopoly on how people could usefully transact. That is obviously no longer the case, and this is one of the main contributing factors to Bitcoin's rise. 

At the end of the day, at the risk of sounding rude, (which I do not want to do) it doesn't matter what you think. Bitcoin is *in use because it is useful to people*. They are using it and therefore it is serving the effective functions of money regardless of how many [breathless PhDs stammer on about how it cannot do this or that through the years](https://themerkle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/professor-bitcorn.jpg).

Can you source this? Bitcoin's been through many social hype cycles in the past, all resulting in the same thing...boom & bust. The floor continues to rise with real adoption.

>Ethereum, for instance is more useful and has more potential in the long run.

On what grounds? What do you know about Ethereum at the protocol level, and how does it serve a better function?

What do you know about the ongoing research & developments regarding the Bitcoin stack?

> hundred other e-currencies

Can you name a few you have an interest in and why?

>nobody is going to spend bitcoins if it's so lucrative as an investment.

People already are. I personally keep majority of my wealth in Bitcoin (already recovered my initial investment) and spend when I want to spend. Just because the value goes up doesn't mean I won't feed myself. I'm still earning as opposed to keeping it in a bank.

As adoption picks up the rate of growth in price decreases.

"The scenario you describe is precisely why I am involved in Bitcoin.

This world is in trouble. Major economies are only kept afloat because poor people feel they need to spend their money today, even if it is on something non-essential, because its value will slip away over time.

The rich have always had access to deflationary or non-inflationary stores of value; and that is what they keep their assets in until they decide they really want to spend it.

Earth has finite physical resources; infinite inflation that is not equally distributed causes unsustainable industries to be profitable for long periods of time. 

There is a massive economic collapse on the horizon because of these backwards Keynesians who think its in our best interest to steal our savings through inflation and hand it over to their buddies. 

Deflationary spiral is a good thing in the long run; and if we want Humanity to have a chance to get to year 3000 or explore intergalactic space; we need a deflationary spiral caused by real money tied to real resources.

">The government could very well artificially create a demand for barbie dolls by putting ads

That's not a good thing.

>Our demand is often artificially created anyways.

I'm speaking to true demand. Demand that will always exist in human populations. Demand for access to food, shelter/safety, and health. Notice how these core needs are becoming MORE expensive and not less? I see that as incredibly unhealthy. Too many resources have been redirected to worthless things. So, I agree. Artificial demand has been created. But you're not looking at the root problem here. WHAT enables ""artificial demand"" for worthless spending to exist in the first place? Easy access to interest free money. If people feel like they're secure in their core needs, they will naturally spend the excess on frivolous want. If you perpetually warp the economy to such a degree that it *appears* that core needs are forever provided for, you've destroyed the corrective mechanism that lets people know its time to STOP frivolous spending and START reinvesting in those core needs. Recession and deflation are *WARNING* signs that we ought to re-allocate our resources for long term provision of these core needs. It's BAD that consumerist crap is easy to purchase. It's BAD that we expend way too much entertainment, but that its cheap to do so. Because it is BAD that so much production has become entrenched and focused on providing these frivolous things. Again, the fact that core needs are rising in price while everything else is decreasing in price is EXACTLY THE PROBLEM. We need to allow the economy to re-allocate resources to solidify the foundation, or when resources become scarce, it will become a much more painful process.

">Nobody needs the barbie dolls, so these factories will require a CONTINUOUS injection of money in order to stay afloat. That's not healthy and sustainable economic development. 

You can say that about the vast majority of government spending and government agencies. That's why things like Tesla, e-cars, corn, etc get subsidized in the first place. Government spending doesn't follow supply and demand.

And we really don't need much of anythings, but we want a lot of things. Our demand is often artifically created anyways. We wouldn't have a demand for fruit loops, lucky charms, coco pebbles, etc if we weren't bombarded by advertising when we were kids. We don't need that fancy diamond ring or that red sports car, but we want it because some parts of society encourages extravgent displays of wealth. Much of the new anti-GMO, anti-Gluten, anti-everything trend arose thanks to corporate advertising and getting a leg up over their competitors. 

The government could very well artifically create a demand for barbie dolls by putting ads in every household for barbie dolls, and half the little girls in America would want them.

"That's an efficient method of commerce. Pay a transaction fee or wait a week for the transaction to process... /s  
  
The guy in the video you linked to stated ""For a flat transaction fee"" and then proceeded to say ""Bitcoin is infinitely divisible."" I was pointing out that infinite divisibility is irrelevant and useless in the presence of the flat transaction fee he claimed existed. Furthermore, his assessment of the required discount for a transaction to occur in a deflationary monetary regime is flawed because it doesn't take into account that as time progresses a system like bitcoin will become increasingly more deflationary and therefore the necessary discount will continue to increase exponentially. This increasing deflationary rate will eventually lead to a deflationary spiral. In this spiral prices in bitcoin terms will continually fall to the point where it becomes worthless as a means of conducting commerce. And at the point when it becomes useless as a means for conducting commerce it will cease to have any value.

"So why didn't Venezuela keep its inflation at 1-3% ?

Venezuela has been undergoing inflation at far greater than 1-3% per year for many years; if you want to define hyperinflation at 50% per month; well that is certainly hyperinflation ; but so is 10%.

Fiat money and inflationary money IS the same thing. Without a hard asset to ""Back"" currency ; it has no backing; just political promises.

Please explain why 1-3% is magical; but 50% per month is too much? So you don't like having your wealth stolen from you because its too much in your opinion; but you don't mind advocating to steal from others if its only 1-3% per year? Hypocrite. Why not 0.1% why not 1.5636%? Why not 10%?

There is no magic in 1-3% inflation; its a number small enough to keep people from recognizing its affect on their wealth in the short term; so they can be pilfered for decades.

Okay... but bitcoin is so young. The point I was making is that once the crypto market is fully saturated (yes, there will be multiple bubbles and crashes on the way there), the price will become much more stable. It will appreciate in value as a deflationary currency which could cause people to hoard as we have already seen. So, maybe it's not the best national currency. That doesn't mean it can't still be an incredibly viable new currency because it's so easy to exchange, holds a good store of value (presuming this holds into the future) and serves as a unit of account. It is the *internet of money*, it's going to serve a distinct purpose. People thinking it will entirely replace the dollar are most likely misguided imo. ;0;1;False;dlandis13;dqm8rzx;This Bitcoin chart is insane!

"> I don’t see enough adoption of it as currency for it to *ever* be useful.

This is a pretty bold extrapolation, considering the potential disruption that cryptocurrencies represent.  Looking at actual vs. potential this early in the game, and making a future prediction based on that, might not be the right way of looking at it.

I personally used to love paying for stuff with Bitcoin when fees were low and it's value was relatively stable.  Like sending 1 or 2 or 5 dollars to someone across the world was an awesome thing in my mind (especially if that person might have been unbanked--this would give them the ability to reach a global market that they were previously locked out of).  Now, though, it costs 1 dollar to send 1 dollar, and if I choose not to spend it, it will have been worth $10 in a matter of 12 months.  

But it's obviously not going away.  We can't uninvent this.  Fees will go down again, innovation will happen, markets will mature, and the volatility will slowly level out, and at that point, it will be both useful *and* valuable.

Welcome to country wide macroeconomics, where shit is extremely hard to balance.  You have to find compromises and find the best ratio of good and bad in all things to keep the machine running or the house of cards from falling.

I mean you could go ahead and outlaw every fossil fuel today.. Awesome for the environment, catastrophic for the population and industry. The opposite is the opposite. So you need to draw lines in the sand.

Inflation is one of those lines. Where it's low enough to not affect the day to day lives of the population, but it also works as an incentive for people spending  loans etc.

For example, why would a bank take a risk loaning you money for a house.. If they can just hoard it and increase its value by doing literally nothing? So at the end that 2% deflation  added to the 2 % inflation lost means your mortgage probably will be 4% higher just for the bank to have her same incentive to loan you the money.

As long as there is a transaction fee there will always be a limit to the smallest transactions conducted.

"Controlled inflation is healthy because it incentivizes people and companies to invest their cash instead of burying it in their backyard, which allows businesses to grow, banks to loan, people to buy cars and houses, and generally create economic growth. 2% per year is the standard target, although we've been below that recently.

Bitcoin is deflationary, which means that burying it in your backyard will make you wealthier over time. It doesn't take a genius to figure out that if everyone holds their money instead of spending it, businesses close, people lose their jobs, loans dry up, and eventually the internet turns off because nobody is paying for it.

"Because fiat inflation benefits Central bankers the most. Just like if you owned stock in a company and they secretly leaked some to you without public announcement and you sold it as if it was part of the originally issued shares. 

Add to that most people don't think to consider money issuance in the same ways as shares of stock and you have a recipe for massive corruption and public manipulation. 

I also theorize that central banks and governments are quietly eating the benefits of productivity gains. We would likely see massive price reduction as we do in technology products but more broadly across the board as more industries reap the benefits of that increased productivity. 

It's interesting to imagine what the world would look like and how cost of living would have been affected had out currency been backed. 

Others will suggest that without the influx of ""cheap cash"" we would not have seen as much industrial and technological growth. It's an interesting perspective but i generally think the market would make better choices than the corruptible (at least) central planners.

"OP's comparison is incredibly misleading. According to inflation calculator, $1 in 1913 is equal to $25 today. That's only a 25x increase over ONE HUNDRED (100) years. This means the dollar has under gone relatively low inflation and is pretty stable. Bitcoin was worth less than a penny back in 2008, but let's just use 1 cent ($0.01) for comparison purposes. Now it's worth $10,000. Bitcoin has gone up 1,000,000x in less than TEN (10) YEARS. This means Bitcoins is undergoing something similar to hyperdeflation or as a rapidly appreciating asset. 

Your coin only going up or down 25x or 1/25x in value over 100 years means it's actually pretty stable and you can actually use it as money. Your coins going up 1,000,000x in value in less than 10 years means it's not really stable and you'll be hoarding it and not actually using it as money.

It doesn't matter if it's inflation (dollars) or hyperdeflation (bitcoins). Money needs to have stability. Very high inflation encourages people to get rid of money asap.

However, in medicine, in groceries, (particularly quality or organic foods), in restaurant prices (both low end and high end), in real estate, in rent, in utilities and in event ticket prices, and across most equity classes, we are seeing rising prices.

QE isn't formally money printing, but essentially it is through a backdoor (primary dealers buy on a Treasury auction -> primary dealers sell it to the Federal Reserve for cash ->  rinse & repeat). The massive amount of QE money is already spent by the government to privates (to pay wages, salaries, equipment, government investments, entitlements aso.) and does not sit in a Federal Reserve vault. 

In addition, the government borrows money through QE at zero interest rate, since the interest paid by the US government to the Treasury bill holder (in this case the Federal Reserve) is paid back to the US government again (by law).  

That we don't see a significant increase in M2 is due to unwinding of privates (paying back their loans, which destroys deposits), which is offset by government spending in order to fight deflation and create inflation. The problem is that government spending is the least productive spending (in terms of GDP, pls. google ""marginal productivity of debt"") for various reasons (e.g. governments never pay back their loans, they just roll them over). 

> While growth in M1 and M2 are big and increasing, there is no inflation yet. But if inflation starts to increase the central bank could decrease the money supply by selling of the assets they bought. This way they decrease the money supply in the hope to limit inflation. 

That is wishful thinking, since the government gets more and more dependent on zero interest loans. If the rates rose due to increasing supply of Treasury notes, then the government had to fund their interest payments by increasing the volume of Treasury emissions, which would increase supply further and would start a vicious circle. In the end the government would spend a growing share of the GDP for interest payments and go bankrupt. So this is a no-go, the Federal Reserve has no choice but to keep or even increase their balance sheet ... unless privates start borrowing like crazy (credit growth to offset the goverment spending), but this is an illusion due to already high debt levels of the population (they lack assets as collateral). 

The only way out of this dilemma is to wipe out all debt by massive inflation (and of course there will be victims like savings, pensions or entitlement recipients since debt=deposits).

"It is my understanding that the inflation rate is low because the dollars that were printed to buy mortgage backed securities was almost immediately deposited in the fed as excess reserves.  With interest rates near zero, the banks can make a halfway decent overnight rate by just leaving the money at the fed.  No risk, some reward. 

Seems to me that when they have to risk money out in the world we will see that money flow out of the fed and into the economy.  When that happens, the inflation rate is going to move pretty quickly.

"**Negative interest on excess reserves**

Negative interest on excess reserves is an instrument of unconventional monetary policy applied by central banks to encourage lending by making it costly for commercial banks to hold their excess reserves at central banks so they will lend more readily to the private sector. Such policy is usually associated with very slow economic growth, deflation, and deleverage.

During economic downturns, central banks often lower interest rates to stimulate growth. Until recently, it was thought that rates couldn't go below zero because people would hold on to cash instead of paying a fee to deposit it.

Negative interest makes perfect sense from a macro standpoint. You just don't want to admit that macroeconomics exist. You're probably one of those people who think that running a national or global economy is like balancing the family checkbook.

Back to negative interest: it should cost you something to preserve the value of massive assets that you aren't using to help the economy grow. Hoarding should be penalized. Why should you be guaranteed a bottom floor to the cost of not contributing to the economy by lending your wealth in active ways that get you better than negative returns?

"Since this attracted quite some attention, I'll try to react to all serious comments. 

I think central bankers understand this dilemma very well and they have yet to find a solution. I think an article I read a couple of years ago summed it up pretty well:

""But this policy of intervening when markets wobble, dating all the way back to the 1980s, has a steadily higher price. Over time, rates get lower and lower and valuations tend higher. Debtors get used to ultra-low interest rates and keep borrowing (that's the point of the policy, after all). But this means that the potential cost of a reversion to ""normal"" levels of interest rates gets even greater; imagine what would happen to homeowners if mortgage rates were 6-7%. What would happen to confidence if the Shiller p/e fell from its current 25.6 to the historic average of 16.7? 

Central banks don't want that to happen and investors know that central banks don't want it to happen. So the two are locked together like a barman and his most profitable customer, endlessly pouring one more drink to fend off the hangover and trying to forget about the cirrhosis that might set in. This is not a new problem, of course; your blogger was worrying about it six years ago. But we don't seem to be any nearer solving it.""";1;0;False;Tallcheddar;dqm92ot;This Bitcoin chart is insane!

">2 incomes barely support a home

You've got it back to front. 

It's women's fault.

Seriously, it is. And I'm saying that as a feminist. House prices started to shoot up once women (rightly) started to go out to work. But once they worked, a couple could afford to pay more for a house, and the free market made  sure house prices rose to that expectation. And now we're all trapped in that new reality so it needs two incomes.

"I think about this sometimes, but when I think about the home my grandparents supported on one income, it is very much different than the home two incomes are supporting today.

Basically, it covered a mortgage on a MODEST house in a working class neighborhood, a car every 7-10 years, gas to get to work, and groceries that they cooked at home (to supplement what they grew, froze, and canned from their garden).

Using that metric, a single income today isn't that far off the mark.

"So the Argentinian peso is not money because it is extremely volatile and had a devaluation event of 65% in a single day? 

Look, Bitcoin is money because it is solving problems for real people in the real world today. This isn't some fancy experiment anymore. You don't have to recognize it, you don't have to even care about it because it doesn't matter. It matters to the people that *do use it*. And for them it *is* money. Which is interesting because for many economists, human problems exist as an abstract concept on a graph. With bitcoin, people now have a choice; competition in the realm of currency, where governments have no say in what they use or how they transact. 

Also, opportunity cost. Again real people, real problems. If my health care requires addressing, you better damn well believe that I will value this above the future value of some of my bitcoins. If I really want to improve the quality of my life with a new house *now*, and I value this above the future cost of my bitcoins, I will use them. The value of my bitcoins have much less appeal to me if I am dead. 

The important part is that bitcoin doesn't care about any of this. It functions and people use it, no matter what anyone says. Volatility or no, bitcoin forgot to ask for permission.

"uh, yeah, obviously we're still in ""price discovery"" mode and will be until certain use-cases are resolved and certain regulations that would have big impact play out.

You're comparing the 1913 USDollar for some reason (i'm assuming the ease of math) and not the fact that to get to that level of stability there were HUNDREDS of years of iteration.

Never mind all of the problems with ""general store notes"" and such that lead to a centralized currency in the first place. You might have some IOU or value store that was, whoops, deemed useless.

So yeah, I'd say your analogy is bullshit simply because bitcoin is still in discovery phase.


ps:

1. you refer to 2008, when bitcoin started in 2009.
2. the valuation wasn't ""1 cent"" or ""less than a penny"" it was literally 0. FOR OVER A YEAR AND A HALF. It wasn't until late 2010 that the value started solidifying.
3. bitcoin does have stability as far as vendors are concerned because they get instant conversion to fiat. a user of bitcoin has no incentive (besides revolution or something silly) to go fiat->btc->3rd party->vendor just to use it. It's more expensive due to transactions and more of a hassle. than fiat->vendor.

So, currency shmurrency... bitcoin's value is completely spurred by speculation as to how it could be used or adopted. companies adopting it for use are merely demonstrations of the potential. the early adopters have 100% of the leverage to sell off, make a profit and pursue the next iterations of it.

"I am pro-crypto, and I do agree fiat isn't the best long-term store of value, but...

Fiat is an instrument which does facilitate a lot for an economy.  I mean this is a 100-year graph.  Cryptos aren't even 1/10th as old.  The two serve different purposes.  Investors have always stayed away from storing considerable wealth in fiat, but move them into stocks, bonds, property, and other assets.  Yet fiat continues to serve a purpose.

Cryptos are an emerging asset class, and as such it has been wise to transfer wealth into it while it is still in its infancy.  The more likely reality is in 10 years where your financial adviser will inquire about your cash reserves, home equity, stocks/bonds, and *crypto* assets.

As long as there are states there will be fully functioning fiat currencies to facilitate the economy.";21;1;False;panda9228;dqlvnvs;This Bitcoin chart is insane! Oh, wait… that’s actually a chart of US dollar money printing.;7guh08;https://i.redd.it/a582ruk7ta101.jpg

"I think Cryptocurrency and Cash can easily play nicely if:

1. All services / purchases must be made in USD.
2. All deposits into Banks must have validating ID's.

Done.

Now, everyone can speculate all they want with Bitcoin. It's just like the way we deal with stocks. We can trade stocks. Purchase futures. Transfer bitcoin. Etc. Yes, it's even a form of storing value. However, whenever we need to buy something from the grocery store, we use USD. Whenever we deposit into a bank, they take our ID, social security, etc. So, if we withdraw in USD, we are taxed on capital gains on the Bitcoin.

- People who want to stay anonymous, just stay in Bitcoin form. 
- People who want Bitcoin to become mainstream might enjoy this if the government allows people to buy as much as they want.
- People who want cash can still deposit Bitcoin in Banks.
- People pay their fair share of capital gain gets to tax Bitcoin gains because Banks have their ID (like we all currently do at a Bank).

I am open to thoughts, but that seems like a easier way to make Bitcoin very mainstream.

"OP's comparison is incredibly misleading. According to inflation calculator, $1 in 1913 is equal to $25 today. That's only a 25x increase over ONE HUNDRED (100) years. This means the dollar has under gone relatively low inflation and is pretty stable. Bitcoin was worth less than a penny back in 2008, but let's just use 1 cent ($0.01) for comparison purposes. Now it's worth $10,000. Bitcoin has gone up 1,000,000x in less than TEN (10) YEARS. This means Bitcoins is undergoing something similar to hyperdeflation or as a rapidly appreciating asset.

Your coin only going up or down 25x or 1/25x in value over 100 years means it's actually pretty stable and you can actually use it as money. Your coins going up 1,000,000x in value in less than 10 years means it's not really stable and you'll be hoarding it and not actually using it as money.

It doesn't matter if it's inflation (dollars) or hyperdeflation (bitcoins). Money needs to have stability. Very high inflation encourages people to get rid of money asap.

"If you want to encourage frivolous spending, then yes, you need inflation. People want to get rid of their ""money"", so they start exchanging their economic energy for goods and services as fast as possible.

But that's not what prosperity is. Just because they include velocity in the GDP formula, doesn't mean that it represents true prosperity.

What you are saying is just a school of thought, and by no means the truth.

If 10 people hold 1,000 dollars... You GPD is 10,000 dollars
If 10 people hold 10 dollars, but exchange it a hundred times, your GDP is also 10,000 dollars.

Which one is the better one? There is no right answer, they are just different.

But I believe a deflationary currency is better. Cause then it serves to safe your money and don't waste it on stuff that's obsolete in 2 years, which in turn is better for the environment. If your currency becomes worth more, by doing nothing with it, producers that want your money, will have to bring more quality, they have to think more sustainably and more focussed on the client. 
I believe that a deflationary currency gives the consumer more power.

"> uh, yeah, obviously we're still in ""price discovery"" mode and will be until certain use-cases are resolved and certain regulations that would have big impact play out.

If it's so obvious then people should stop pretending it's currently a currency that can replace well established and stable national currencies. It's currently a speculative investment commodity and has a long way to go before it fulfills its goal of being a currency.

>You're comparing the 1913 USDollar for some reason (i'm assuming the ease of math) 

Look at the original post for this entire article. The chart referenced early 1900s money printing.

>and not the fact that to get to that level of stability there were HUNDREDS of years of iteration.

Doesn't that tell you more about the unrealistic enthusiasm of some bitcoin owners who think bitcoin can replace stable currencies within our lifetime? Y

>So yeah, I'd say your analogy is bullshit simply because bitcoin is still in discovery phase.

Then stop treating it like it is the answer, solution, and replacement to national currencies.

It's still an experimental item treated as an appreciating asset. It's nowhere near a stable currency.

>you refer to 2008, when bitcoin started in 2009.

Typo/Brain-fart. 

>the valuation wasn't ""1 cent"" or ""less than a penny"" it was literally 0. FOR OVER A YEAR AND A HALF. It wasn't until late 2010 that the value started solidifying.

That makes it even worse, no? Creating an unstable asset out of thin air that was worthless then but now worth 10k each now and enriching all the early investors who trade them in for dollars. That doesn't improve its legitimacy as a stable currency whatsoever.

>bitcoin does have stability as far as vendors are concerned because they get instant conversion to fiat

It has zero stability in terms of the people who actually have bitcoins. You can use a bitcoin to buy pizza today, but if you know it'll double in value in a year, your incentive to hold it as an assert rather than use it as currency. That makes it a failure as a medium of exchange. 

Again, bitcoin is like gold. It's an asset you hold on to and occasional sell/barter out. It's not really currency because the point of currency is to use it to buy/trade for OTHER things, not buy and hold itself. If someone invented an instant exchange that can convert gold into dollars, then vendors would be willing to take gold too. 

>the early adopters have 100% of the leverage to sell off, make a profit and pursue the next iterations of it.

Which makes it a great speculative trading commodity but an absolute failure as a currency. Bitcoin has so far not come close to achieving its objective as an e-currency.

Not necessarily, there are a few macro variables that affect inflation, the one that consumers/investors/ non gov control is an outward shift in aggregate demand. So yes, if they somehow spent all their billions in consuming or investing, then inflation would run rampant. But that's extremely unlikely. Also, if you'd like to research more in inflation I highly suggest looking into the Inertia of Inflation, which gives an intuitive explanation to how it works and why inflation is rarely ever negative or 0. Finally, id like to point out that a controlled inflation rate is actually a GOOD thing.

"Value and inflation are connected. Inflation is caused by the value of something going down. 

Money/cash dollars and E-currencies are both assets. E-currencies are non-tangible assets that you can create more of  - you can create more e-coins through mining, forks, creating new e-currency, etc. Bitcoin can have many derivatives, and there will be thousands of e-currencies to compete with bitcoin within the next decade. 

In the best case scenario, even if Bitcoin was a tangible asset like gold, the economy would still be susceptible to depression, inflations, etc. The gold standard not being able to create a larger supply of money in response to rising value and production of other asserts restricted economic growth and caused a lot of problems. [Edit: I just realized you are not the guy claiming e-currencies can't have bubbles/depressions, so that may not be relevant] 

Folks are currently treating e-coins as an investment/stock opportunity so they can sell it for a higher price later. But that would defeat the entire original purpose of using Bitcoin as actual currency.

At the moment I don't value Bitcoin at all. I actually do like e-currency, but I value other e-currencies like ether more as they're actually more useful and serve a practical purpose. Any investment in Bitcoin I would make would be for speculation purposes only and will trade it for actual currency at the right time.

"I disagree. The most basic commonality of bubbles is over-evaluation of something (could be anything). You really don't need to increase supply to create a bubble. 

Take a look at the housing bubble crash. A good chunk of the housing market bubble wasn't caused by an increase in supply, but rather an increase in the value of preexisting homes. You can't ""increase supply"" as you can't build houses overnight and you can't build houses in areas where there are already houses. 

In fact, the housing market is comparable to Bitcoins - in many areas of the country, you have a static, unchanging number of houses in a community, but those houses went up in value far more than the fair market value and thus still created a bubble.

You don't have to recognize it, you don't have to even care about it because it doesn't matter. It matters to the people that do use it. And for them it is money. 

For some people, it is money. For most people, it is a speculative asset where they can make money.  As for solving problems, there are e-currency alternatives that are better than bitcoin. Etherum, for example, actually has a more practical purpose in computing

"Inflation= value of your currency goes down.
Deflation= value of your currency goes up.

If you have negative currency (i.e. debt) you want the value of it to go down. Therefore, inflation encourages you to be in debt while deflation encourages hoarding. In an exchange economy, we want to encourage circulation of money through lending/borrowing. 

The stagnation of currency (hoarding) can lead to a deflationary spiral where the hoarding creates false scarcity of money supply, which makes the value go up more, which causes more scarcity, which leads to more hoarding, and around and around.

If the value of currency is constantly falling a little, it makes people treat the currency like a hot potato and invest or spend it rather than just let it sit there depreciating.

"Talk about buying something with bitcoin. Everyone screams ""DON'T SELL YOUR BITCOINS.... HODL FOREVER!""

Now this happens because they believe it will be worth more tomorrow. Why spend X BTC for something  if Inc's wait until it's 15000$ and spend less btc.  But at 15000 you will wait for 20k then 50k etc.

Basically you will never spend on anything always waiting for the rising price.

Now imagine this same scenario with the USD. Nobody spends today because you can buy more tomorrow instead. This makes people hoard money instead dog spending it. Which means less cash flow through the country and less taxes.

That Jamba juice at the corner? Probably broke because nobody is going to spend any money there today if it's not essential because they'll have more .  What about best buy? And the entire electronics market? Well you don't really NEEEED that Ps4 today, let's wait until next year and I can buy the ps4 plus more games because the currency is worth more.

Basically it can make the economy grind to  a halt in every nonessential market. Also means less taxes because less money being spent.

That's obviously a ver simplistic way to see it but inflation is there to make you want to spend money, which is what moves the US Economy basically.

"What's good and bad in our current economy may not be the same for a theoretical Bitcoin economy.


Bitcoin is inflationary, actually, just controlled and decreasing over time until it is neither deflationary nor inflationary. The supply.

The deflation people refer to is because the price is increasing.

So the deflationary effect on the value of the currency in a theoretical Bitcoin economy would be exclusively from permanent funds lost or an increased birthrate.



So that said I wouldn't see runaway deflation of value happening, more a slow and steady one that is controlled by the code and therefore unchanging by people at the top making decisions. Whether or not this would result in a good economy cannot be measured in the same way our current system is. Our values have changed to match the current system (Remember ""neither a borrower nor a lender be?"" That definitely doesn't apply to our current system.) and our values would need to change to match a theoretical Bitcoin system. ";1;0;False;mokahless;dqm709y;This Bitcoin chart is insane!

This isn't necessarily a bad thing. The idea of maintaining inflation and slowly devaluing the dollar is to encourage investment. It becomes more attractive for businesses and individuals to put their money into assets like stocks, bonds, real estate, or production because otherwise cash becomes less valuable if it's just sitting stagnant.

"Have they ever had you on an antibiotic called SMZ/TMP? something like that i dont know all the name brand names for it. that shit exacerbates it.

You could have undiagnosed nutcracker syndrome, which sounds like something i just made up but it is real, a problem where the vein/artery flowing to your testicle passes through a place where it is slightly pinched way higher up like in your kidney, this causes pressure build up in your testicle because the bloodflow goes through your balls and has to exit but the exit in your kidney is narrow so you have chronic high pressure in your nut.

It is genetic and many people inherit it from their mother but often women feel no symptoms or maybe it just manifests as some occasional kidney/back pain for them. so that is one thing to look into because they can surgically open that space with a shunt and you will feel better pretty much instantly.

In my case i had something similar to that but induced by inflammation from antibiotics and fucked up guts, they had me on antibiotics because i had that testicular pain but the pain started from being on SMZ/TMP in the first place from when a brown recluse spider bit me on the face, then they kept prescribing me that shit for over a year because my nut hurt and i was super fucked up from it. Then one day i was going to kill myself because my life was pure misery from it so i just stopped taking all the pills and started using herbal medicine for prostate and ""mens health"" and eating Kim Chi and all sorts of high dose probiotic stuff. and stayed away from inflammatory foods but you have to find out which foods fuck you up specifically. The pain diminished but was still bad enough that i just didnt want to do anything that involved moving around until one day i ate an overdose of cannabis brownies and hallucinated while puking and shitting violently then went and passed out on the floor. The next day i felt almost completely better after over a year of torture.
