there will always be people willing to pay cash for it, to use it for shady things.

shady dealers who accept will maybe need fiat so surely a supply and demand thing emerges.

if on and off ramps are banned then the existing Bitcoin or crypto which isn't on exchanges goes up in value relative to the decrease in quantity.

"If you were the NSA, it would be irresponsible not to develop these tools. I bet that they've had powerful analysis tools at their disposal for the past 5 years. With AI, they might become scarily effective and in that case, the only thing saving you would be that they don't have enough manpower to prosecute everyone.

If I sold drugs online, I'd be insanely careful, using tumbling in conjunction with privacy coins, a couple of homemade VPNs with automated secure wiping capabilities in foreign countries, a laptop purchased with cash a couple of years in advance and with the camera and microphone disabled physically, using Linux on an external encrypted storage device that can be destroyed easily, my Internet access would happen through 4G connections (would using data plans from foreign countries and bought with false identities help or increase risk?) and one of the 4G connections would act as another homemade VPN, this time located somewhere close where I could easily detect a physical intrusion.

I wonder how feasible it would be to hide a 4G VPN in a wall (behind an electrical socket for easy access to power and to the wall's insulation material to create a cavity without leaving a trace) at a property you don't own (Airbnb, etc...).

"You didn't understand his comment.

He's talking about drugs, firearms, stolen electronics, looted antiquities, stolen art, untaxed cigarettes, etc..., which get exchanged for cash everywhere in the world even though it's illegal. Billions of dollars exchange hands on these markets each year.

It's almost certain that cash will disappear at some point in the future since governments are so eager to be able to track all transactions and since the average human uses cash less and less compared to a few decades ago when payment cards weren't as ubiquitous.

Cash will disappear, but the need for means of exchange that are anonymous or pseudonymous will always exist. People could be going back to gold, but in all likelihood, cryptocurrencies will become the means of exchange of choice for people who used to use cash for their secret transactions.

Banning exchanges would hurt bitcoin's use case as an alternative currency for everyday transactions, but it wouldn't affect bitcoin's use case as means of exchange for transactions in the parallel economy. A minuscule percentage of humans own bitcoin at this time and look what that did to its price. If bitcoin were used for all illegal transactions in the world, its price would be higher than it is today.
