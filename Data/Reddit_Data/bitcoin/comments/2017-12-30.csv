"Peer to peer lending is a viable alternative to centralized banks. The only reason you don't hear much about it ATM is because institutional investors drowned the market before it caught on in the mainstream (read: peer to peer works really well, but you are such an insignificant peer that you'll drown in an ocean of whale spit).

There have been quite a few platforms that earned people a lot of money before the whales noticed and snapped up all the best opportunities. I think one was called Lending Club IIRC, and it worked by dicing up big loans into $25 pieces and letting investors buy and sell them something like a bond. Included was a credit analysis based on FICO, but if we're imagining a world where banks are dead FICO's probably out. I can see a lot of ways smart contracts and tokens can replace FICO/credit history though, so instead of the murky blackbox that is the myriad ways FICO gets calculated, one might rely on the blockchain in a clear, easily verifiable manner (that doesn't cost $60 to peek at!).

Thing is, sure I don't have $400,000 to loan out, but some people do, and it wouldn't be much of a risk. Break it into pieces and sell them to mom and pop immediately (well before the usual default period) and suddenly your risk is minimal.

Really, the problem is unscrupulous people offering really crappy (subprime) initial loans and hawking them off on mom and pop who really have no business assessing the integrity of a specific loan application.";1;0;False;etasyde;drxpfu5;2018: lets run for office;7lo56s;https://i.redd.it/oy1bmxd0on501.jpg
"Theoretically it shouldn't be too hard to script something to turn the smart contract into something more human readable (this already exists). After that, existing infrastructure can take over - and by that, I mean courts and law enforcement not necessarily banks. IANAL but AFAIK Courts of law are agnostic to the currency involved in contracts. The only snag is whether smart contracts are legally binding, which any government can flat out say they aren't.

You can avoid wage garnishment now using the same techniques that apply against cryptos, so that's really not a unique problem here and clearly the infrastructure still works. If you're getting paid under the table, your employer is breaking the law regardless of whether it's Crypto or Fiat. If you're not, and the government wants a piece of that for whatever (hopefully legal) reason, then it will go after the employer for garnishment, not hope you send all your money to a convenient address.";1;0;False;etasyde;drxownb;2018: lets run for office;7lo56s;https://i.redd.it/oy1bmxd0on501.jpg

"Um, what?  What are you talking about?  Who ever said that shelters are not better than being forced to be outside?  That's silly.

What I did say is:

> As a homeless women, I actually don't advocate donating to shelters. They are almost universally horrible or at least bad, in all kinds of ways. And they will mostly waste the money. 

> Instead, give to organizations that give people free rent, or very low rent, unconditionally, in healthy, collaborative spaces, so that the residents can heal and be productive in whatever way that makes sense for them.

We are comparing shelters vs. actually effective organizations.  No one ever mentioned comparing shelters to being forced to be outside.

Giving to the places that actually aim to stop homelessness is far, far, far more productive than giving to places that keep people homeless.  It's just basic logic.  If you actually want to solve the problem, that is.

A lot of people don't, though.  A lot of people actually like there to be homeless folks, stuck in shelters.  I never imagined that would be the case, but having been in and around many of these organizations and people, I've found that many of them like the status quo, not just because they rely on it for their jobs/money, but also because it means less work for them, and that lame work can still make them feel ""good"" about themselves.  I've heard so many of the people who are employed at shelters and their related organizations effectively say ""You should be glad I came in today.  Otherwise you wouldn't be able to do anything.""  As if we were pathetic invalids who needed their protection.

As soon as I come in and actually want to solve the problem, most of these folks get freaked out and try to ignore or dismiss me, or worse.";1;0;False;Turil;dryau7w;I'm donating 5057 BTC to charitable causes!

"Hello,
I think what you are doing is amazing!

I have been sick with ME/ Chronic Fatigue Syndrome for years now, and I hope you could make a donation to the Open Medicine Foundation.
Chronic Fatigue Syndrome may seem like a controversial issue, but in fact patients are being neglected severely by doctors and the government. Because ME/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome is an 'invisible illness' and there is no reliable biomarker to diagnose it yet, doctors tell you that you are crazy and don't believe your symptoms. From an outsider's perspective this can seem like a controversial issue, for someone who has ME/CFS it is a horrible situation to be in.

This is a youtube video from the 'Millions Missing ME/CFS Protest' in Seattle and it shows some personal stories from people with ME/CFS, I found the part at 3.44 very touching. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYX3NjJ7OAU
This can make clear that so many lives are impacted by ME/CFS and people suffer horribly, often without any public awareness.

I think what you are doing is amazing, and with the power of money comes responsibility, as Spiderman said. I know ME/CFS in not a simple, undisputed issue in the public, but you could make an enormous difference for so many people with your donation. 

ME/CFS is horribly underfunded and your donation would make a huge difference.

Sending love and many thanks for the good deeds you are doing,

"Cute. But plenty of us used to use it for everyday purchases...and of course, that was back before the IRS ruling...which was before bitcoin had as much time and nearly as much exposure in order to be picked up by merchants, so of course, you'll derp on about how there was no place to spend it even then.  Clearly bitcoin and bitcoiners are stupid because we didn't find a magical way to program immediate worldwide acceptance of and ubiquity of a brand new digital asset that nobody had ever seen before.

Yup, a very astute and fair and falsifiable critique of bitcoin you've got there.

Or maybe you're referring to the high fees? Well, that is a cogent critique now, but was not the case for most of bitcoin's history...so you still don't really have a point. Furthermore that's why we have bitcoin cash, which a lot of us consider the main fork of the protocol, and fees are very low and will continue to stay low enough to use as a currency, were it not for the tax rules...plus we're having to largely start over with onboarding merchants.

So again, you're completely off the mark. Try again though.

"We don't have all the facts on this.  Historically in this space, government's rules and regulations, or their criminal investigations or seizures and freezing of funds, have often been the cause of holdups like this, or outright losses.

The AML/KYC regime which Coinbase and others have to try to comply with is so Byzantine and ambiguous (its a ""guilty until proven innocent"" and ""doesn't matter what means you use to catch launderers, you are responsible...so make them insanely tight"" system)...that there's almost no possible way for any broker like Coinbase to play it safe and still manage to accommodate a very busy period.

Why on earth anyone would think that what is going on here is some vindication of a statist world-view is beyond me.

You're probably one of these morons who complains that nobody uses bitcoin as a currency...then turns around and celebrates the fact that the U.S. and other governments have classified crypto as a capital asset for tax purposes; never drawing the connection in your head about how those tracking and reporting requirements make it all-but-impossible to use crypto as an everyday currency.  You probably never draw the connection in your head between the government cracking down on small-time OTC sellers, and the dried up market there: which sends everybody to the hyper-regulated centralized services like Coinbase, in the first place. You probably never draw the connection in your head between the performance of the few Coinbases who can comply with the regs, and the general lack of competition. You probably never draw the connection in your head about how government courts lack of willingness and ability to protect the property rights of cryptocoin holders, and the turmoil that law endorsements investigations and scandals have had on the space and the regime uncertainty which politicians have caused with their rhetoric or threats of banning, translates to institutional uncertainty including lack of robust private insurance on crypto deposits and thus lack of auditing and accountability on that side of the business.

"**Currency transaction report**

A currency transaction report (CTR) is a report that U.S. financial institutions are required to file with FinCEN for each deposit, withdrawal, exchange of currency, or other payment or transfer, by, through, or to the financial institution which involves a transaction in currency of more than $10,000. Used in this context, currency means the coin and/or paper money of any country that is designated as legal tender by the country of issuance. Currency also includes U.S. silver certificates, U.S. notes, Federal Reserve notes, and official foreign bank notes.

"Dude you are the one completely missing the point the other guy was making.

It is likely that, like a bank, Coinbase is required by law to halt/delay transactions exceeding a certain value in a short amount of time. This is to combat money laundering etc, whether or not you are actually part of it.

That, combined with how overwhelmed Coinbase already is, leads to fiat/coins being held up for so long.

Nothing about that is illegal, as Coinbase never claims the funds are theirs, nor are they stealing them. Hence why he asks you what it is you believe they are doing illegally.

"United States  
Coinbase, Inc., the company which operates Coinbase and GDAX in the U.S., is licensed to engage in money transmission in most U.S. jurisdictions. Most of Coinbase’s money transmission licenses cover US Dollar Wallets and transfers. In some states, money transmission licenses also cover digital currency wallets and transfers on the platform. In other states, no money transmission license is required to operate a digital currency business

Coinbase is also registered as a Money Services Business with FinCEN.

Coinbase is required to comply with many financial services and consumer protection laws, including:

The Bank Secrecy Act, which requires Coinbase to verify customer identities, maintain records of currency transactions for up to 5 years, and report certain transactions.
The USA Patriot Act, which requires Coinbase to designate a compliance officer to ensure compliance with all applicable laws, create procedures and controls to ensure compliance, conduct training, and periodically review the compliance program.
Most states’ money transmission laws and corresponding regulations. 



Digital Currency

Coinbase prioritizes the security of our customer's funds, all digital currency that Coinbase holds online is insured. If Coinbase were to suffer a breach of its online storage, the insurance policy would pay out to cover any customer funds lost as a result. Coinbase holds less than 2% of customer funds online. The rest is held in offline storage.

Please note that the insurance policy covers any losses resulting from a breach of Coinbase’s physical security, cyber security, or by employee theft. This insurance policy does not cover any losses resulting from the compromise of your individual Coinbase account. It is your responsibility to use a strong password and maintain control of all login credentials you use to access Coinbase and GDAX.
For more on securing your account, see here.

Digital currency is not legal tender, is not backed by the government, and digital currency accounts and value balances on Coinbase are not subject to Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or Securities Investor Protection Corporation protections. 
 
Cash Balances

U.S. Customers
Coinbase stores all customer fiat currency (government-issued currency) in, custodial bank accounts, or in U.S. Treasuries. 

Non-U.S. Customers
Coinbase stores all customer fiat currency (government-issued currency) in segregated, custodial bank accounts. 

Cash balances held in your Coinbase accounts belong to you- not Coinbase. 

If you are a United States resident, your Coinbase USD Wallet is covered by FDIC insurance, up to a maximum of $250,000.

Even if Coinbase were to fail as a business, the funds held in the custodial bank accounts could not be claimed by Coinbase or its creditors. The funds held in those accounts would be returnable to Coinbase’s customers.

"You're not getting it:

Someone holds your money up, it's a business transaction, you solve business issues like that (generally) through through civil litigation.  Now if there is something more nefarious, then you may talk to a magistrate/attorney general/police and they *may* make criminal charges.

Showing up to someone's house, again, where they live with their family, is a tool move.  Regardless of whatever the BUSINESS issue is, showing up at the CEO's house (who may very well not even be involved in and/or understand what's going on) is going to almost instantly be criminal trespass.

As a matter of practicality, you think if someone feels like you're physically threatening them and your family it would encourage them to resolve the issue?

I have an open ticket as well with similar problem.

Have sent BTC to coinbase.  Coinbase confirmed via e-mail that funds have been received and action needed to be taken to move BTC to GDAX.  Within minutes automated message said the BTC was moved to GDAX.

Think about the difficulty you will have if your private wallet provider does something nefarious. It’s great in theory to be your own unregulated  bank.

"Hi, [Justin from Coinbase here](https://support.coinbase.com/customer/en/portal/articles/1766604-is-coinbase-present-on-social-media-). Very sorry for your experience and the delays in getting it addressed. I've replied to your support ticket and managed to get your issue resolved. 

The fact that you had to resort to Reddit is not something we take lightly. This is definitely not the kind of experience or customer support we're trying to provide, and for that I apologize. 

I’d like to take this opportunity to give a little bit of context on what’s happening. All of us at Coinbase are very committed to helping our customers and improving the experience. It’s our top priority at the moment. We are in the middle of a tremendous surge of public interest in cryptocurrencies, and when a company experiences hyper-growth it has a way of stressing many aspects of the platform, most notable are on the front lines with our support team. We are scaling up as fast as we can, but right now the ecosystem is growing just as fast. 

Issues from hyper-growth are good problems for a company to have, but it doesn’t mean they are not significant issues. The customer experience is poor for some of our customers right now, and you’re seeing a taste of that with your deposit being delayed for so long. I apologize for that, but I also know we are 110% committed to improving the situation for customers that have issues ASAP.

Bear with us, we will make this better, we will improve and be able to handle all of our customer’s questions and requests, and we will address your issues as quickly as we can.

"How many times do we have to see Coinbase/GDAX rip people off and completely ignore any and all lines of support before people wake up and STOP using them and STOP recommending them? 

It was bad enough that they supported the Segwit2x attack, expecting everyone else to upgrade whilst not even bothering to implement Segwit and batching themselves (expecting the community to 'upgrade' so they get cheaper transactions whilst they literally do nothing) but the support is **abysmal**.

Time and time again we're being warned that if anything goes wrong, which it will at some point you **will** be ignored by 'support'. They'll **never** get back to you and until you threaten them with actual legal action nothing will happen because they are perfectly content to shit on you and the wider Bitcoin network because that's the cheapest option.

**Stop using Coinbase, everyone right now. Stop using Coinbase.** We see these posts **every fucking week** on this sub and yet people are still using them. **Stop using coinbase, do not recommend them to friends. Tell any friends that you have recommended to close their account.** I can't believe I'm agreeing with Bank of America on this one. That's how bad things are.

With the countless warnings of this nature we are seeing here, you have zero excuse to keep using them. Wake the fuck up, or shut the fuck up when they rip you off. It **will** happen eventually. I will be personally down voting the next 'upvote for visibility because Coinbase ripped me off' post I see and every one after that (I did upvote this one) as apparently people might actually have to lose money permanently to get the message. 

OP, in terms of practical advice as this stage other than the 'I told you so' message. Raise another ticket on the 2nd, when everyone is back at work. Give them 7 days to resolve the matter to your satisfaction. Call them every day and demand a resolution by the 9th. They'll ignore you again. Go to a lawyer, and get the lawyer to write them a nice letter, referencing all of your ticket numbers so far, with the instruction that you intend to take legal action if not resolved in a reasonable amount of time. Now it'll actually cost them money they might actually respond.

But the Coinbase response is to continue seating customers, taking orders, and charging for food that isn’t served.

"Thanks for the reply, Justin. It’s a relief to finally have this resolved. I hope that despite all of my frustration, you’ll agree that I tried my best to refrain from outright slandering you guys since I have had a great experience on CB/GDAX until this incident. 

I’m sure if you do some digging, you can see I reached out through EVERY CHANNEL possible (short of visiting the office in person). Like I’ve mentioned before in reply to others in this thread- everybody, incl myself, understands that you guys are overextended due to the unprecedented volume of interest in crypto this year. Despite that, what I felt was inexcusable were the dismissive responses- both on email and from the phone support staff. The “maybe you didn’t use high enough of a fee” or “pls be patient and just wait” type of response I received is perhaps more frustrating than not receiving a response at all. There’s more to building a successful support team and PR than just meeting KPIs like avg response time or number of interactions before a resolution. I’m sure you guys know this, and are doing your best to work it out. 

Despite this rough patch, you guys have played a tremendous role in making a hyper technical and inherently complex product accessible to the masses and in a lot of ways, the bitcoin/crypto  community owes a debt of gratitude to Coinbase for that.

"When you factor in that they gave the rest of all the coins to their own company, iirc they still own upwards of 60% of the coins to this day. 

That means when you buy Ripple you are for the most part buying them from the founders and their company who can parse the coins out at a pace that puts supply below demand increasing the price and maximizing what they can sell for. 

What happens in a one sided market like that when those buyers decide they want to sell, filling in that gap in demand? I think it's safe to assume the founders and company will not be buying. They can simply sit, wait for the buyers to eat the loss, and then slowly start selling again when/if speculative demand starts up again.

"You invested your money in cheap altcoins. It is only natural that you would want them to replace bitcoin.

I happen to think that nearly all altcoins are propped up by the fact that they can be mined more easily than bitcoin.

The high fees and large mempool are a direct measure of bitcoin's success. Most cryptocurrencies would have a hard time handling a similar volume.

I am not blind to the fact that these are big issues, but I also know that they can be solved instantly by increasing the size of bitcoin's blocks.

"Saw this explanation worth repeating:  ripple isn't a currency. It's liquidity. It's a vehicle for moving value. It doesnt compete with other coins. People dont realize that it's because of ripple that the rest of the world will be able to accept our crypto without trusting it. Look into it further. You'll come to find that what's good for XRP is good for every other form of value, including all other cryptos. It scales the ledgers of every coin via the interledger. Ill be able to pay target in DASH for groceries because XRP bridged our currencies...allowing me to pay in DASH and have Target receive that same payment in USD (their choice currency) all at the point of sale and under 4 seconds. People no longer need to trust crypto to accept its value in USD or EUR. Just wait, it will change everything. Buy in or miss the boat!
