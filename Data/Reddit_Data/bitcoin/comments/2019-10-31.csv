&#x200B;

This. 

Teachers have a lock on the ""teacher's are underpaid"" rhetoric, but the average US teacher salary is $60k/yr. That's not including benefits (approximately $20k more per year), a generous retirement, and plenty of vacation days. 

Yes, it varies greatly by school and state, but the bigger issues are that bad teachers are paid just the same as good ones (actually, bad teachers make even more, since they are less likely to put in extra effort or purchase additional teaching aids) and most schools themselves are underfunded (requiring the good teachers to pay for their own teaching aids in the first place), while also being entrenched in a system that reinforces systemic poverty by dividing up school budgets according to neighborhood wealth.

There are lots of improvements that could be made to the current education system (at least in America), but increasing teacher salaries is nowhere near top of the list.";3;4;False;silasfelinus;f5ys86j;11 years ago today...;dph8ek;https://i.redd.it/p1udquwefsv31.png

In my opinion society isn't trying to be green. Not at fucking all, it's pure greenwashing. The state isn't defending us from polluters, it's defending them from us. But with cryptocurrency, we'll soon be able to crowdfund our defense without it being censored.

"No.  

Today we have a small group (central bankers) who have the sole ability to create as much money as they want, from thin air, backed by nothing.  To create their money only requires them to enter numbers into bank computers.  

That group then uses the newly created money to enrich and empower themselves and their cronies -- at the expense of the rest of us.  **This is the root of the wealth gap**.  Fiat money gets ""printed,"" then used to purchase assets, that is, actual wealth.  

**This cannot happen with Bitcoin**.  No central banker, no government official, nobody can just ""print"" loads of Bitcoin -- it must be mined, according to the rules / protocol / algorithm.  Bitcoin's supply is extremely limited.  

Will some people get into Bitcoin early, then become fabulously rich as a result?  Yes.  In fact, many already have.  Is this fair?  Yes, because those individuals were paying attention, saw through the FUD, and those individuals took risks (they could have lost, and in the case of shitcoins and scams, actually did).";6;1;False;Mark_Bear;f5wq0s2;11 years ago today...;dph8ek;https://i.redd.it/p1udquwefsv31.png

"I really feel as is crypto currency is a big can’t see the tree from the forest issue.  We are constantly trying to be greener as a society but the energy consumption of the bitcoin network would rank it as the 40th most power hungry nation in the world.  It’s basically just another way to inflate the value of the U.S. dollar.  Since the U.S. dollar is how we trade crude oil, and crude oil is still one the most popular way we generate electricity,  a rise in electricity use means a rise in demand for crude oil which in turn boosts the u.s. dollar.   

I know I go against the grain on this one but I really don’t see a net benefit to crypto currency.

"> those individuals took risks

I remember wiring $3000 to some bank in Japan (Mt Gox) and my local banker telling me that it was a scam.  She literally pleaded with me not to send the money.  The branch manager got involved and I told him I would leave the bank (empty my accounts) if they didn't follow my instructions.  It took about 1 hour of time and cost me a $65 (fee).  I knew that day that BTC would win.  Now if I want $3000 sent somewhere in the world I just do it with BTC.  No branch manager/teller telling me what to do with my money.  The transfer is nearly instant and cost very little.  The old banking system is already at the gallows.  The noose is bing put around it's neck.

So it's great to 'be right' but when 99% of the world is crooked and wrong, what is the point?;-7;1;False;tommygunz007;f5vn3k7;11 years ago today...;dph8ek;https://i.redd.it/p1udquwefsv31.png
