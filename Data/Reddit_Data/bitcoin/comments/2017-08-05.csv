"I'm looking at it more from a logical / engineering / scientific viewpoint. 

I'm not seeing the evidence that 20th century history has exhausted all possible configurations of implementations of socialism. A history of failure doesn't prove it will always fail. You could have said the same thing about airplanes in the 1800's.

No political affiliation, haven't found any evidence of the existence of any current ideology that isn't full of ignorance and even trivial factual errors. There's some good ideas in most places, but everybody are always trying to phrase theirs as an all-or-nothing deal. I really have no interest in getting involved in politics at all (too much dumb conflict). The closest would be social liberalism (but there's plenty of stupid there too), or pretty much anything else focused on cooperation without restricting people. 

Most of the changes people want to enforce with laws should instead be enforced with a change in culture, and/or with improved system designs that make malice unprofitable compared to cooperation (which is exactly what Bitcoin does with its mining incentives). People should help others because it's the right thing to do. They should cooperate because that's the most efficient on a society wide scale. They also shouldn't interfere in anything that doesn't hurt anybody. The rest are mostly low level details that are too contextual to set in stone.";1;0;False;Natanael_L;dl6itf2;Two biggest Bitcoin subs according to their counterparts (posted on both subs);6rjzu2;https://i.redd.it/hl4l7joqnpdz.png

Look buddy, if you want to backtrack because you've changed your mine that's fine.

"10 000 000 users' LN commitment transaction at a size of at least 200 bytes each would take 1900+ MB. That's the same amount of blocks, or 13 days *if they're the only thing added to the blockchain*. That sets the minimum payment channel lifetime at 4 weeks - because as soon as you settle, you need to create a new channel (two separate transactions). 

That also excludes settlement transactions between LN servers. It also excludes literally all non-LN usage. 

Scale it up to the many hundreds of millions users in the west and potentially billions in the east, and Bitcoin will never be more than a curiosity on an international scale if this is all we'll ever get.";1;1;False;Natanael_L;dl6jlag;Two biggest Bitcoin subs according to their counterparts (posted on both subs);6rjzu2;https://i.redd.it/hl4l7joqnpdz.png

"I was around long before Bitcoin XT. I want mainline Bitcoin Core to take a reasonable stance that won't force Bitcoin to permanently become a historical curiosity from being unable to scale. LN+segwit isn't enough for even one single whole country with 1 MB blocks. If we want Bitcoin to be successful we need to accept that it has to change. Perhaps even drastically so.

"Bitcoin created decentralized trust. Understanding the implications of this are critical in understanding bitcoin. 

As OP described wonderfully above, our current system relies on a bank to act as a trusted third-party when two parties are transacting. For example, when I swipe a debit card at a store, the bank tells the store that I have enough funds to pay for my items. The store trusts the bank response, thus trusting me to walk out of the store with merchandise and that they will be paid. 

Bitcoin shows that trust doesn't need a centralized third-party (i.e. banks) to establish trust. You can have a decentralized network of trust instead. People can easliy, safely, and securely transact on this network of decentralized trust. This is ground breaking. It completely disrupts a major value proposition for banks.

"That makes sense. 

Now, wouldn't that let the currency vulnerable to a large attack by a powerful actor like a government or a transnational company ?

The way I see things, bitcoins value can only go up in time, because they are overall really safe, while the difficulty of maintaining the whole structure safe will only increase, mostly because technologies in hardware and cryptography always improve, but also because as bitcoins take more value, they draw more attention. If energy becomes scarce, governments will control most of available energy. I have a feeling that the security that keeps bitcoins safe and trusted for now will not hold governments back in 100 years (maybe even in 20 years if things go awry). In those conditions, I am easily seeing a superpower like USA or Russia taking bitcoins down if they challenge their suppremacy a bit too much. It's not like USA have not done such things before...

"Bitcoin mining costs will always closely follow the mining reward, because mining difficulty always automatically adjust to maintain the 10 minute interval. 

Increasing currency value and transaction fees increase reward value => more mining, and with reduced currency value and reduced fees => less mining. 

Given the relatively small overhead cost of the electronics of mining, the electricity cost will dominate the mining costs over the long term. 

So if the mining reward is X dollars worth per block, close to X dollars will be spent on electricity for mining.

"> But indexation on worktime also means that bitcoin safety is directly backed by energy consumption.

There have been some attempts to try and fix that situation so the massive CPU power consumption isn't as bit of a deal.  Naturally these are legitimately ""alt-coins"" like NXT and a few that attempt to perform something useful with the CPU usage along the lines similar to SETI@Home (to give an example of distributed computing that performs a public service rather than simply chewing up CPU cycles for no good).

Nothing has really taken off though in terms of alternatives (even though I'm a bit of a NXT fan myself.... but not completely sold on it either).

Bitcoins in and of themselves are eventually going to go away, even though I think they will last likely as long as FRNs (Federal Reserve Notes) and will definitely outlast the existence of FRNs.  

The concept of a block chain with some kind of encryption & hashing function as tied to safeguarding money is something here to stay for as long as mankind is around though, which is the really neat thing about the wonder that Satoshi started.  The major central banks are now looking into adopting the concept into the overall global money supply, which speaks volumes about how effective of a concept it has become.

As far as an ""energy crisis"", I'm not worried about that at all.  There is going to be a period of readjustment as government leaders get their collective heads out of the ground and move to real alternative energy sources and stuff that has been kicking around, but cheap & reliable electricity production is definitely available at levels many times what is currently being done globally and can be maintained for millennia and potentially millions of years or more.  In that time frame, I really think fusion energy production is going to be a real and practical thing where there is always mining Jupiter & Saturn for Hydrogen if you think there isn't enough elsewhere.  In other words, any shortage of energy or electricity production is due to intentional failures of the market caused by government interference and intentional political actions to keep electricity from getting made.";3;2;False;rshorning;dl7sdpa;Just a quick reminder why Bitcoin was invented in the first place.

The security of bitcoin comes from having a distributed set of people mining. If electricity becomes scarce the overall difficulty will drop, and collectively we won't need to expend as much energy mining. That becomes a problem for the network if a small group of people control the electricity, but so long as electricity is dispersed enough that no group controls a majority of the mining power the network can remain securely decentralized. ;5;0;False;AusIV;dl7qnm1;Just a quick reminder why Bitcoin was invented in the first place.

"(PS: what I have in mind is mostly some situation when for whatever reason there would not be suddenly electricity at disposal for longer period i.e. week or so)

I have no solid info on that, but I strongly doubt, that there are paper records as of paper is not really that good for compression of datas and long-time storing.
There sure are some backup servers with self sustainable (for some time at least) electricity generators, but imagine the hoard of data. 

But sure as hell they rely on electricity and suddenly having to go back to the paper (which would be in situation when everyone would want to withdraw their money) would be catasthrophic, because they would not really be prepared for that.

Side notes:

1) I totally agree with the point that in most of the situations described above, bitcois or any other saving will be the least of our concerns.
2) Even if Bitcoin would work without problems only for another 50 years or so it still would be great way of dividing your money to not loose all in case of some trouble.
3) Debate on what will be in 100 years is IMHO completely useless as of people will come with another solutions and another completely new problems will arise.

Maybe I didn't explain my point very well. What I'm saying is that debt carries an ongoing overhead, which can be a drain on both the debtor and the creditor. If we're able to optimize chains of debt in the way I described, we potentially save a lot of wasted time and effort\*.

"> To answer you other question ""why is debt bad"", I'd say it's because it precludes anonymity. When you lend someone money you want to know all about them, their history, and how you can get hold of them if they don't repay the debt. You then have to monitor repayments and take action if it's not being paid.

Why does the lack of anonymity between two consenting parties worry you? Both parties proactively decided to enter into the arrangement, with the terms (presumably) clearly laid out. Would you prefer to step in and prevent people from entering into mutually-beneficial contracts?

"I don't think that all inflation is moral. I only disagreed that inflation is necessarily inherently immoral. For example, the current 2% inflation rate in the US is perfectly acceptable to me.

The government has a moral responsibility to manage the money supply in the best interests of the population. A small amount of inflation is an acceptable cost for stability.

If it became widely used, Bitcoin would be a deflationary currency (same as gold) and far less stable than the US dollar, because there would be no way of controlling the money supply to react to changes in the amount of economic activity. It would also do nothing to prevent the use of debt-based financing; it would just be denominated in Bitcoins instead of dollars.";2;1;False;guysir;dl7h5bm;Just a quick reminder why Bitcoin was invented in the first place.

"Inflation is not the same thing as debt default, theft, or appropriation. Inflation does not change the number of dollars you hold. It changes the value of those dollars when measured against other valuable items. Some amount of inflation/deflation is completely unavoidable in every possible currency (fiat, gold, crypto, or otherwise) because the supply and demand of things in the world change over time.

Morality is subjective. I'm not projecting my views onto anyone (hence why I said ""to me"" above), but it sounds like you are:

> Inflation has, is and always will be immoral.

If you live under the delusion that it is possible to maintain a currency that has a perfectly stable value over time, then you will eventually be disappointed by reality. Bitcoin may not be inflationary, but it is deflationary, and that's arguably even worse. Using your own words, it would be ""theft"" against the people who *don't* hold a majority of their savings in Bitcoin.

To maintain relative stability in the value of money, its supply and demand absolutely *do* need to be controlled. This is why the Federal Reserve exists. Otherwise you would see rampant deflation during economic expansions, and rampant inflation during economic recessions.

? The US has *never* defaulted on debt. How is something very rarely paid when it is always paid, for over 200 years? (with one exception of a strange case where they delayed payments on an extremely small amount of bonds in 1979). Seriously, what the fuck are you talking about?

>
In the USA public debt is being managed by printing/creating more fiat money

Seigniorage is just one way the debt burden is eased, and is taken into account by people who buy government bonds. In the long run, the level of inflation can not help manage debt. Only short term increases can ease debt because debt holders will account for a steady level of inflation. Since the US has been a steady 2%, obviously this is not the case.

"Bitcoin is not representative money, it is not tied to something with inherent value (e.g. Gold standard dollars). It is not commodity money, it has no inherent value (e.g. Gold, livestock). It has value because a group of people, the inventors and early adopters, agreed to use it and give it value. The 'decree' part of fiat usually means a government is involved, but it does not require it be so; in this case the inventor decreed it to have value and people agreed to try it. The complaints listed above fall into two categories; dollars are controlled by banks, and dollars are not commodity/representative currency. Bitcoins would solve the first but not the second, because botcoin has no inherent value, nor does it represent something of value.

"It's a shame to see you getting downvoted for these comments. Sometimes people in the Bitcoin community talk about sound money as if the concept never occurred to anyone before Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009.

One of the things that really excites me about Blockchain tech in general is that it opens up the possibility of managing debt more effiiciently. One can envisage a network which automatically optimizes chains of debt. In the simplest case Alice owes Bob one dollar, and Bob in turn owes Charlie one dollar. This can be simplified, automatically, to say that Alice owes Charlie one dollar, eliminating Bob from the equation entirely. Scale that up to many millions of debtors and the system would become exponentially more efficient.

To answer you other question ""why is debt bad"", I'd say it's because it precludes anonymity. When you lend someone money you want to know all about them, their history, and how you can get hold of them if they don't repay the debt. You then have to monitor repayments and take action if it's not being paid. Privacy concerns aside, if nothing else it's an incredibly inefficient process.";9;3;False;Matthew-Davey;dl7acl0;Just a quick reminder why Bitcoin was invented in the first place.

"No doubt. The thing is though, very few experts ever actually proclaim themselves infallible.  It's the know nothings that assume experts THINK themselves infallible, and then when sometimes they get it wrong (which is inevitable) the know nothings can't wait to scream ""see?!?

"**Dunning–Kruger effect**

In the field of psychology, the Dunning–Kruger effect is a cognitive bias wherein persons of low ability suffer from illusory superiority, mistakenly assessing their cognitive ability as greater than it is. The cognitive bias of illusory superiority derives from the metacognitive inability of low-ability persons to recognize their own ineptitude. Without the self-awareness of metacognition, low-ability people cannot objectively evaluate their actual competence or incompetence.

As described by David Dunning and Justin Kruger, the cognitive bias of illusory superiority results from an internal illusion in people of low ability and from an external misperception in people of high ability; that is, ""the miscalibration of the incompetent stems from an error about the self, whereas the miscalibration of the highly competent stems from an error about others."" Hence, the corollary to the Dunning–Kruger effect indicates that persons of high ability tend to underestimate their relative competence, and erroneously presume that tasks that are easy for them to perform also are easy for other people to perform.

"Solid OP. 

However, I have a couple questions (am noob) and felt creating a thread would be overkill.

1) How will bitcoin address the scaling issue? Not here to shill but IOTA has a neat concept (tangle vs blockchain) regarding scaling: https://iota.org/IOTA_Whitepaper.pdf

2) How will bitcoin combat it's centralization around ASIC miners? I think Vertcoin's lack of FPGA / ASIC mining capabilities is something closer to ideal here, as it decentralizes the control a bit, in theory at least.

3) I think implementing some privacy centric features, like that of XMR, could benefit as well.

4) The ledger is huge and growing until the last block is mined. Is this going to be addressed?

Is it possible to have all these technologies on a single coin? Is there any activity towards addressing these concerns?";1;2;False;junk_f00d;dl7cqcw;Just a quick reminder why Bitcoin was invented in the first place. This used to be preaching to the choir.

"No, this is actually a big joke. The bitcoin system is extremely well designed but suffers from a huge flaw. Indeed it does not use a third party to garantee transaction. Instead it uses the worktime (not workforce but worktime) of a huge network of computers. The fact that garantee is based on worktime and not workforce is supposed to prevent hacking from becoming trivial because of augmentation of computers power.
But indexation on worktime also means that bitcoin safety is directly backed by energy consumption. As long as computer power rises, their energy consumption rise alike. If an energy crisis happens and the price of electricity skyrockets, the network that garantees bitcoins will crumble as mining becomes economically inefficient. Miners would rarify, until the point where the currency becomes easy to hack and therefore unstable, then is completely given up. Meanwhile, banks can work with pens and papers would the need arise, making them effectively crisis proof.

"> What remains is an inflation rate in the 2% range.

I'd like to correct that.  What remains is a **claimed** inflation rate in the 2% range and an overall target by the Fed to attempt to achieve that rate with no standard as to how inflation is even measured in the first place.

If you used the same measurement standard for the CPI (Consumer Price Index.... at least one semi-legitimate measurement of inflation) that was used in the 1970's, [the USA would have averaged about 10% inflation per year over the past decade](http://www.shadowstats.com/alternate_data/inflation-charts)

In other words, the real facts are far worse than what is reported, and inflation of the U.S. Dollar is intentionally being kept low for many reasons, not the least of which is built-in ""cost-of-living adjustments"" (sometimes called COLAs) that make it extremely useful to under-report inflation.

Don't buy the hype that FRNs have maintained a low interest rate and that The Fed is trying to keep inflation down.

And yes, that is one (out of many) of the reasons among many that people are fleeing to Bitcoins as a place to store money.";0;0;False;rshorning;dl7rj9a;Just a quick reminder why Bitcoin was invented in the first place.

Commercial bank money is always backed by bank's assets, which are usually loans which bank give to corporations and people. Those loans might be backed by mortgages and other property.

> When you take out a loan, money is created and lent to you. 

That's how it works from money supply accounting perspective, but in practice it requires somebody else to deposit money into a bank. Without deposits bank will quickly run out of reserves and won't be able to give out loans.

> Sure, banks need to keep adequate reserves. But these reserves basically consist of the same credit-based money. And reserves are much lower than the loans they make.

"Serious answer: You don't have to use those 'alt' coins. (In fact, you don't have to use *any* crypto-coins, but you do have the option now.)

It is a fair question though, and I can see why it bothers people that haven't spent much time studying ""network effect"" as well as how the crypto-currency space itself has operated for years. That said, this 'bcash' phenomenon will be a great test-case: If bcash manages to gain/retain traction as more than a niche alt-coin, then your concern may be valid -- but even then, so far it seems to have not put a dent in Bitcoin proper and has 1/10 the value.";4;1;False;spendabit;dl7t6db;Just a quick reminder why Bitcoin was invented in the first place.

"That summary is similar to what my thoughts have converged on, although I hadn't broken it down into such a well thought out sequence.

Thanks for writing that up.

My two favorite points in the above:

1.  The wealth being created by our getting better at making things, a natural deflationary force, and the natural state of a technological soceity,  is being skimmed by the banks printing money.

2. The reason the gold system of the 1930's collapsed was that it was a fractional reserve gold system where we printed more notes than we had gold backing them.

Point 2 is widely misunderstood.  Lots of people who consider themselves well read in economics say that the financial chaos of the 1930s was a result of our being on a gold standard coupled with deflation that got out of control.  If only the FED were not on a gold standard, they could have printed enough money to turn the deflation around.

Point 1 is even more deeply, and widely, misunderstood.

It was hard to displace fiat money systems once they became firmly established.

The combination of uniquitous wireless networking and smart phones, however, allows for the distributed public ledger solution which opens up the whole field of currency and payment systems to competetion and innovation.

I suspect that bitcoin is going to give rise to lots of currencies and payment concepts that we have barely glimsped so far.  For example, if I could trade in fractional shares of stock peer to peer and with low fees, there is no reason I couldn't pay for a cup of coffee with 0.001 shares of IBM, say.

"That's really the only thing we need to realize.

All these ppl who say they know for sure bitcoins role in the global financial system are fools. We all have our ideas, of course, but none of us know.

But we don't need to know. All we need to do at this point is ask ourselves : "" Is there a use for frictionless, instantaneous global money transfers?""

If the answer is yes (which is clearly is) then you buy.

Capital behaves like electricity, or water: it will always take the path of least resistance available to it, and it will always seek to reduce friction. To that end, Bitcoin is so obviously an upgrade to existing capital infrastructure that it's widespread adoption is almost inevitable.

The worm is turning fast. While it seems like it's been a long time to legitimacy for most of us, for most regular ppl, it will seem like it happened overnight.

That's kinda me right now. But I buy it knowing that I can easily exchange it back to USD or buy goods with it. I recently bought some electronics off Newegg with bitcoin. As for a currency, it was fake money for the first few years until major governments put some legislation and actually considered it real money. 

If you took a finance class, you might know why it's volatile right now. If you knew anything about computer science, you might know why it's better than regular currency *in some ways*.

People who held a lot of bitcoin cashing out their bcc. I think it was maybe bittrex early to open deposits but with a 20 confirmation wait time before trading, which is a day+, and just maybe yesterday hitbtc opened deposits with a 2 confirmation wait. So people who held their own bitcoin have just through today started having those coins available to trade, and many are moving them to bitcoin, litecoin, monero, etc. expecting that bcc will crash in value over the next several days.

"It's not necessarily common knowledge that the cryptocurrency world has its own robust exchange infrastructure. Just seems like the response might be more useful if the first paragraph was removed, the rest of it was inverted, and references to some specific exchanges were included, like so:

There are many exchange websites that specialize in trading between cryptocurrency and ""real"" (or what is more often called ""fiat"") money. These include Coinbase/GDAX, Bitfinex, Kraken, and many others. To see what the market looks like in real-time, go to bitcoinwisdom.com if you want to watch the charts, just like a stock-market chart.

The value is determined by the market. Meaning that people are buying Bitcoin from people for 3.2k currently. If it falls, it means people are not willing to pay that much. If it rises, it means people are willing to pay more.

Usually that would have been a smarter move financially - not so clear now - but in the long term it should still play out similarly & even if I get less coin, I'm still helping to push cryptocurrencies forward.;1;1;False;;dl7o5zm;$3050!!;6rphzd;https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/e4/38/99/e4389936b099672128c54d25c4560695.gif

You guys are joking but I think there's something bigger going on, and it's pretty great because it shows something. This is how I look at it, I was hodling but at the same time I was getting a little pissed about fees and transaction times because it felt like Bitcoin is up for upgrade, anything, I was using it pretty frequently to buy stuff online. Here's the thing, this Bitcoin split is showing something else. Bitcoin is not winning as a cash replacement (fortunately or unfortunately), it is winning as a better store of value. At this point Bitcoin is digital gold rather than currency. And I know that people have said it before and what not. I just think this split actually showed what people want and how they use it. There are more people who use it as investment and store of value, than those who use it as currency and require fast transaction times and rooting for bigger block to accomplish it. ;2;1;False;_ferz;dl6zmx7;$3050!!;6rphzd;https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/e4/38/99/e4389936b099672128c54d25c4560695.gif

"**Suspicious activity report**

In financial regulation, a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) or Suspicious Transaction Report (STR) is a report made by a financial institution about suspicious or potentially suspicious activity. The criteria to decide when a report must be made varies from country to country but generally is any financial transaction that does not make sense to the financial institution, is unusual for that particular client or appears to be done only for the purpose of hiding or obfuscating a transaction. The report is filed with that country's financial crime enforcement unit, which is typically a specialist agency designed to collect and analyse transactions and report these to relevant law enforcement units. Front line staff in the financial institution have the responsibility to identify transactions that may be suspicious and these are reported to a designated person that is responsible for the reporting the transaction.

"Well they have different exchange markets going on. Neither coinbase or gemini make the price at all - the market does. They tend to follow each other but not exactly. For instance there could be a breakout on gemini where many people buy on that website at once, so the price increases there, and it could take a little bit for crypto people as whole to realize what's happened and that will cause people to rush to coinbase to buy, thus sending the price up there and so on. This happens throughout all the exchanges and when you look up a price from a non-exchange you'll see the average of all the different markets selling. On gemini you'll see all the people bidding, etc. With coinbase you can go to GDAX.com and see the same thing. GDAX is the exchange market connected to coinbase so you can use your coinbase login info.

"> I don't know if all exchanges do that as part of their service fees or not.

Coinbase is not an exchange. They can justify adding the 30-50 basis point margins because the exchange rate is volatile and that protects them if it changes radically between when they quote you a price and when you confirm the purchase & they place the order. This type of fee doesn't exist on exchanges.

If you trade on an exchange you'll typically pay 0-0.2% fee for each transaction.

"It's a long and complicated story but basically there was a brutal civil war in the bitcoin community that went on for a long time leading up till August 1st when bitcoin split in two. The idea was to let the market decide which one would be the real bitcoin as people would vote with their dollar and sell the one they didn't want. The true bitcoin established dominance over the forked bitcoin, which is called ""bitcoin cash,"" and once this was clear the crypto market regained much of the market cap that it lost during the weeks up to the August 1st split as fiat was rushed back in from the sidelines. 

It rose quickly in the last few days so I'm expecting some kind of pullback but it shouldn't be too drastic as it was hovering around $2,800 before August 1st and a major upgrade is set in place next week to make transactions with bitcoin quicker and cheaper. You know the saying, buy the rumor sell the news. If it keeps rising before implementation of the upgrade then it will probably drop as people realize it's overbought in anticipation for that and people going full FOMO (fear of missing out).

""Too late"" is a huge financial fallacy. People thought it was too late when it went from pennies to 10 dollars. Then it was too late when it was 100...500..1000...If you bought at 1500 you'd have doubled your money by now. 

Second is that you can buy pretty much as small an amount as you want. Want $10 worth of bitcoin? You can buy that. Granted, you still only gain value by percentage...so if you buy $10, in order for you to get $10 more, BTC would need to go from $3000 to $6000, vs if you had a whole BTC, you get that $10 by it going from $3000 to $3010.

"This guide is decent. It's for Electrum but the general concept still applies.

https://electrum.org/bcc2.txt

You want to move your BTC from the wallet(s) you've been holding them in to a completely new wallet with new private key (if it's Electrum you want to create a completely new wallet with a new seed phrase, not just send to a new address under the same seed phrase).

Some guides suggested sending a bit of post-fork bitcoin to your current BTC wallets before moving the full balance(s) to a new BTC wallet.

Then you can import the private key for the wallet(s) you just moved all your BTC out of into a BCH/BCC (I guess I still don't know what it's being called really) wallet and you'll have all your BCH safely separated from your BTC.

Then you can send you BCC/BCH to anywhere that's taking deposits if you want to trade it for something else.

"Here's what I did:


1) Moved all my BTC to a new wallet

2) Restored the old wallet (which now was empty of BTC) in a BCH-specific wallet (Electron), which gave me access to the BCH equivalent of the BTC

3) Transferred the BCH to another wallet - I used a BCH wallet on my phone app

4) Used the exchange built into my phone wallet app to exchange the BCH to BTC.

Pretty straightforward, but anything involving BCH seems to take a long time. The exchange from BCH to BTC took several hours.";1;0;False;djgreedo;dl734te;$3050!!;6rphzd;https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/e4/38/99/e4389936b099672128c54d25c4560695.gif

"Thanks! I'm just now getting myself set up and testing wallets and funding systems, so this info is super helpful. I was going to set up an account on Gemini today as well as trying out a variety of wallets. Sounds like it's going to take some time, but it's worth it if there are lower fees. 

Do you know if Gemini mark up the costs of their coins? I noticed that there was a markup on the price I paid on my transaction on coinbase. It was actually non trivial. (At the time of the transaction the exchange rate was $2774, but they added 30 basis points for a total of $2804.) I don't know if all exchanges do that as part of their service fees or not. There was an additional fee added onto the coinbase transaction too. It seemed they were double dipping. 

As for Ethereum, I have a very small amount in a Jaxx wallet that I set up just to exchange BTC for ETH. Seems to work very well. I'll likely keep adding to that amount and offload to another offline wallet once I have enough there to make it a good idea.

"I have a question about this. I confirmed a trade for a single BTC via ACH on Coinbase yesterday and it marked the price with fees at 2880 and change. The ACH doesn't actually happen until my bank gets and fulfills the request. Does that mean I will end up paying the amount marked by the exchange or the current market price at the time of funding? The market maker already marked and submitted the ACH request. Would it even be legal to increase the price after the fact?

"You sell the bitcoin. It is so weird that people don't understand how basic and simple it is to sell your coins. If people are willing the buy it, you can sell it. 

Your bank account is linked to the exchange (it has to be to buy it in the first place). So after selling the coin, the money is deposited into your bank.

The value is determined by the market. Meaning that people are buying Bitcoin from people for 3.2k currently. If it falls, it means people are not willing to pay that much. If it rises, it means people are willing to pay more.

"Basically, bitcoin has been moving up in price since it's creation. As of late, there was an argument about how to correctly move forward with the currency. Bitcoin got so popular, that scaling was an issue. The network was getting clogged up, and people struggled to figure out a solution.

However, a solution was accepted, and was implemented successfully. But a few people who wanted it the other way decided to ""split off"" and make a new alt-coin that is not following the majority.

When that fork happened, everyone with Bitcoin basically had access to both. So, if you had 1 BTC, you now had 1BTC and 1 BCH. 1 Bitcoin and 1 Alt-coin.

2 things are moving the price up now: 
1.) A scaling issue that has harmed the popularity of bitcoin for the past 2 years has been fixed. Confidence that this coin can actually be programmed to fix issues is very high. Bitcoin is showing us the future of a decentralized currency that is also adaptable with consensus. 

2.) People are taking their extra alt-coin, and selling it for Bitcoin. Even though it is still quite difficult to do, I would expect the price of the alt-coin to keep falling, as more BTC holders figure out how to safely move both coins from their wallets.";4;1;False;givvy12;dl718gn;$3050!!;6rphzd;https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/e4/38/99/e4389936b099672128c54d25c4560695.gif
