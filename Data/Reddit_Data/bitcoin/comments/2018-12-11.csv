If you want to convince me of something, you don't have to tell me anything about how clever or knowledgeable you are... you have to *provide valid evidence* for what you're trying to convince me about.

>...which I think are valuable.  
>  
>...I don’t think bitcoin got everything right...

These are exactly what I mean.  You can talk about what you think as long as you like.  I don't care what you *think*, prove it.

>You almost definitely are invested in bitcoin, and therefor become emotional when talking about it.

I don't view Bitcoin as an investment.  I view it - and use it daily - as a currency.  I'm invested in it in terms of time and energy, sure, because I believe it's a valuable project that has the potential for profound and wide reaching positive effects on the world.

I'm not becoming emotional at all.  If you're referring to my usage of the word ""fuck"" in my previous reply, it's a matter of emphasis that is necessary when dealing with people who either stubbornly refuse to read what is written, or are too dimwitted to understand it.  For now, I'm giving you the benefit of the doubt and assuming you just didn't bother reading anything I wrote, but if you claim you did, then - until I get evidence to the contrary - I'll have to assume you're a dimwit.

>This doesn’t allow your brain to operate at in a capacity that optimizes rational thought. Therefor you defend bitcoin with your dying breath,

No... just no.

>as you try to singlehandedly disprove all of academia.

I probably have a lot more experience in academia than you do, and one thing I can say about it is that ivory towers are definitely a phenomenon.  Economics is a field where this is especially true.  Many economists spend so long learning about ""how things work"" that they don't take a step back to think about ""how things could work"".  There are economists with years of study behind them who can barely explain the concepts of any economic model outside of the currently popular Keynesian debt-based system.

I also highly doubt that ""all of academia"" disagrees with me given how much disagreement exists within academia itself.  I wouldn't doubt that the majority within a narrow field of study disagree with me, but again - see above regarding ivory towers.  Go find some physicists and have a conversation with them about how Bitcoin's proof-of-work function works.  Get really deep in to the technical aspects of how it works.  I've never met a physicist who didn't become convinced of Bitcoin's value after having that conversation.

>An alternative coin will come around that makes bitcoin obsolete at some point in the future

Why?  What will stop bitcoin from adopting the new useful technology from the other coin (assuming it really is useful) and by virtue of having greater historical work invested in the chain, being a more secure system with the same technology on top?

>looking at its Market Cap compared to other real currencies, it pretty much has always been obsolete.

Hold on, didn't you say earlier than you're an economist?  And you actually believe that the *Market Cap* of a *Currency* is a meaningful thing to talk about?!

>...a fortune off of blockchain...

Blockchain is a boring linked list.  Bitcoin is a collection of technologies (including a blockchain) that provides a global immutable ledger.  A blockchain alone provides nothing of any interest to anyone and you certainly can't ""make a fortune"" off it other than by being a scammer.

>simply because they think the first mover advantage will outweigh all other competitive advantages future coins could have.

No.  Bitcoin has a first mover advantage in both **technical** as well as social terms.  The social advantage of being a first mover is good, but bitcoin is *provably better* by having had more work put in to the generation of its blocks than any other chain.  This isn't just ""it was first so it must be best"", it's ""this is mathematically more secure than that, so it is better"".  As already said, if any other coin adds a real feature of interest/value, bitcoin can simply adopt that feature and remain not just equal, but provably better than the newer coin.

This isn't just hopium and wishful thinking, it's fundamentally true as described by all our understandings of the properties and behaviours of the universe.  So, unless you want to argue against the concept of entropy and/or the arrow of time (refutations of which would be sufficient to show that proof of work doesn't provide value), I'm not sure how you can even begin to argue against this.

Economics; physics; computer science; sociology.  If you don't understand a decent amount of *at least* these four fields, you're working with incomplete information when talking about Bitcoin.";1;1;False;dalebewan;ebkk36k;Satoshi Nakamato;a4zaeb;https://i.redd.it/8bex0dm4di321.jpg

So, you either didn't read or didn't understand what I said.  I very clearly spelled out how proof of work ensures both fundamental value and why bitcoin can't simply be replaced by another coin.  You ignored it entirely.

You were the one talking about how you're an economist.  I never claimed any special credentials or qualifications (I have them, but I didn't bring it up, because it's not relevant or important).

>Seems like you’re mad about something

No, I'm really not.  You're projecting.

>but there is NOOO way I could be right about you being excessively emotionally attached to bitcoin.

I already said I am emotionally invested in it.  Again, you failed to read that apparently.  I believe strongly in the project and I would indeed be unhappy if it failed.  I'm also emotionally invested in my family, hot sauces, cognitive liberty, and many other topics.  That's called ""being human"" and is generally viewed as a good thing.

>It’s not a currency and won’t ever be. 

All I'm asking is for you to provide some actual evidence of (or even solid arguments in favour of) this position.  I disagree, but I'd like to be proven wrong.  If I'm wasting my time and energy on something stupid, I want to know it.  But note: I want to ***know*** it, not just have some random guy online tell me so and me run off believing him.

Bitcoin doesn’t have any intrinsic value whatsoever. It will almost definitely always be around, but it will be just as obsolete as it has always been. Serving a tiny niche market for mostly black market transactions. Maybe that will Change in the future but you have absolutely no proof or resources that COULD say such.

The only evidence needed,  to prove that it isn’t a currency, was provided originally, OH MAYBE YOU WERENT READING LOL. One more time for you, IT ISNT A STORE OF VALUE. You can run off believing what you want but that is just a fact. 

Also, bitcoin can and easily could be replaced. You must really enjoy the perception of reality you’ve created, feeling all cozy about your safe bitcoin investment.

In financial terms, losing 80% of value is practically death.. sure, it didn't go to zero -- which was probably due to one of the tech's best stabilization features (slow replication and slow transactions) -- but.. it did lose most of its peak value.

I mean, this is good for the coin, as the point of it was to be a real currency, not some random stock value. And to be adopted and regulated, it needs to go way down, closer to 1. Think about it, which ""real"" currencies are 2000x stronger than a dollar or euro? Unfortunately while it's fluctuating like this, it's not doing any good for the adopters, especially not for companies or legislation.

">Falling from 20k to 3k is death by every mean.

No... it isn't.  In fact, the exchange rate between bitcoin and USD is at best a secondary indicator of how well it's doing, but even that is being extremely generous and it's probably better to say it's essentially irrelevant.

>but in financial terms it's unstable and a bad investment

So, it's bad for increasing your wealth.  Okay.  I'm not sure I agree, but even if that were true, it's irrelevant since it's not the point of it.  That's like saying Ford has failed because when I tried to drive to Hawaii, my car just sank.

>It's success in the originally targeted use cases is marginal at best (again, sadly).

I'll agree that adoption as a currency isn't where many may like it to be at this point, but it's still reasonably good and is constantly increasing/improving.

">The only evidence needed, to prove that it isn’t a currency, was provided originally, OH MAYBE YOU WERENT READING LOL. One more time for you, IT ISNT A STORE OF VALUE. You can run off believing what you want but that is just a fact.

I read it.  And it didn't prove anything.  It was a statement; not an argument, not a reasoned argument, just a statement.  Statements prove nothing and writing it all in caps doesn't make that any more the case.

>You must really enjoy the perception of reality you’ve created, feeling all cozy about your safe bitcoin investment. 

I don't have a bitcoin investment.  Again, you failed to read.

>All the while remembering how much money you’ve already lost.
