"**Stress Relief (The Office)**

""Stress Relief"" is a two-part episode of the American comedy television series The Office. They constituted the fourteenth and fifteenth episode of the fifth season, and the 86th and 87th overall episodes of the series. Both episodes were directed by Jeffrey Blitz and written by Paul Lieberstein, who also plays Toby Flenderson on the show.

In this episode, Dwight stages a fire in the office to test the office's fire safety skills, but things go from bad to worse when Stanley suffers a heart attack, causing Michael to come up with ways to relieve stress in the office, including a comedic roast of himself.

"No. All alts are coupled to BTC/ETH right now, and those two exert some gravity on each other as well, because you largely still need to convert to them to get back into fiat. When people are panic selling they're generally converting to those 2 coins and moving them to coinbase and then selling for USD.

That's why a few days before an altcoin boom you'll see BTC gain. And likewise if there's an altcoin dump you might not see BTC fall until the next day.";15;1;False;nxqv;dz2bqoq;Cracks me up everytime;8jro4y;https://v.redd.it/e98xroy4v4y01

Dude actually made multiple 10k pizza deals, as you can see discussed via Btalk. However the real crime was not the sale (first one anyhow-as that paved the way for bitcoins currency use) it was that the 🍕 was from Papa John’s! ;5;0;False;ChiBitCTy;dz3gwjl;Walter White's confession about bitcoin;8jut80;https://i.imgur.com/BZgElgt.gifv

"""85 . 126 million... I look it up every day.""

this made me laugh out loud lmao just imagining the permanent black cloud of bitterness and deadness in the eyes. 100% would never be able to eat pizza again. I'd literally go into Vietnam flashbacks just seeing pizza.

I had a buddy that sold his Bitcoins during one of the early rises... value had been more or less flatlined for so long that selling for a few hundred dollars profit seemed like a smart move at the time.

I take it as a cautionary tale to not look at crypto in the short term.";269;5;False;j-shwift;dz2o54s;Walter White's confession about bitcoin;8jut80;https://i.imgur.com/BZgElgt.gifv
