Yes, you are right.  My grandma's banking transactions are highly wasteful and will stay that way because she is uninterested in using bitcoin or even just basic on-line banking.  She goes to the same bank she has used for the past 50 years.  A bank were about 10 people work every Monday through Friday.  They use lots of electricity expend a lot of human work time to make sure her money flows.  Bitcoin is far more efficient.  Good point.;1;1;False;Steve5555p;e935fxv;Anti-crypto propaganda... promoted by American Express;9ophqs;https://i.redd.it/1ecxehgvvks11.png
"> Bitcoin is far more efficient. Good point.

no because your grandma still need this branch and 10 people will still have to work there with the addtion that the transactions itself wastes 10.000 times more ressources than a normal bank transaction.";1;0;False;godlikeplayer;e937mjr;Anti-crypto propaganda... promoted by American Express;9ophqs;https://i.redd.it/1ecxehgvvks11.png

"Wikipedia:
A 2009 investigation concluded that Titor was likely the creation of Larry Haber, a Florida entertainment lawyer, along with his brother Morey, a computer scientist.[3]

Hes a hoax, none of this predictions have been right, yet. Nucleair war, US dividing into 5 smaller countries. Nothing. Whats to read about him?

Since ive done what you said you should now aswell. Read about the universe, and watch cosmos a space time odessy. 

After that read about ancient egyptian religion, its basically the same as 'modern' religion but a few thousand years older. 

God was copied to keep the masses calm, this is my stand. 

Edit: actually that you believe in a time traveller from 2036 says enough.

Read about John Titor and you'll find proof of Hell, and by inference you can probably figure out the rest...don't worry, someday it'll be more obvious.  I was exactly like you, there's nothing wrong with not taking a stand until you understand, it's a remarkably reasonable position to take.  I just hope it's not too late by the time you begin to give yourself permission to believe.
