Exactly. If Coinbase goes \*poof\* so does everyone's Bitcoin. Even a BitPay wallet is better than keeping your BTC at Coinbase.

"No sir.  Federal reserve notes are not dollars.  A dollar is money.  By its very name it is not money, it is instead currency.  It is something that is traded.  A federal reserve note is like a claim check to money.

Ever go to the dry cleaners and drop off a coat for cleaning?  They give you a claim check, (that is a piece of paper), that you can use later to get your coat back.  That is how they know which coat to give you.  If you wanted to give your coat to someone else, you could just give them the dry cleaners claim check and they could go to the dry cleaners with it and get the coat.  But we can all agree there is a big difference in wearing a coat or wearing a claim check.

Is gold money?  Answer: yes.
Is a receipt for gold stored in a bank vault money?  Answer: No, but it could be currency.  If someone was willing to accept the receipt or claim check for gold in a vault in lieu of the gold itself.

If you refuse to understand the difference between real money and a promise to pay someone money, then I cannot help you.

If you think a one dollar federal reserve note is a dollar, then their plan has worked and you have been tricked just like millions of others.  I used to think the same thing, until I discovered the truth.  Granted, it was not easy to grasp at first, but keep working on it.  Don't fall victim to prolepsis.  Just because your parents and all of your friends think that a FRN is a dollar and call it a dollar does not make it one.  There used to be dollars, but when the US left the gold standard for money, notes were issued to replace dollars.  They look similar, but words have meaning, and those FRNs of today have very different set of words on them.

I really think you could benefit from the youtube video in my comment.  I think you are not understanding the abstraction between an item and the receipt for an item, or its proof of ownership.

"Yeah I get that, but he's surrounded with people who argue with him about what gives value to Bitcoin. I find it hard to believe that nobody told him what ""owning"" bitcoins meant at any point. It is one of the key feature that gives value to Bitcoin (i.e. the control you have on your funds as long as you know your private key and keep it secret/secured).

So either he refuses to learn/accept this, or he's really unable to learn it. Either way his critique that ""Bitcoin has no value"", cannot be dissociated from this property of Bitcoin, it's so fundamental.

Maybe this loss will teach him (although I've already seen him repeat that Bitcoin has no value again [no later than today](https://twitter.com/PeterSchiff/status/1220189536044691456)...).

"Fiat does have the illusion of holding value though. Inflation is usually sneaky enough that it spreads over a long enough time to make people think it actually holds value.

Bitcoin is a Nth layer solution on top of TCP/IP to solve the use case of trustless money. Just like SMTP is a protocol, also built on TCP/IP which solved a problem for exchanging messages.
