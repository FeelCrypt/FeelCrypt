"Ah, a response of someone unwilling to look beyond their own bias.

">People don't look to the gov't for everything. You need to stop generalizing. 

How am I generalizing? There have been numerous cries for campaign finance reform ever since citizens united. I still haven't heard why I should get behind the idea of telling people what they can or cannot do with their own money. I don't see how limiting people's ability to spend money is somehow equated to a more equal and free democratic society.

It's the same thing as saying ""sure, you can practice your religion but you can't spend any money on it!"", it's nonsensical.

This situation of rent-seeking is a byproduct of a government that has too much say and too much power. Not to say there isn't ""dark money"" in politics but do you honestly believe that campaign finance reform will ever be able to stop that?

Honestly, I'm not even sure what you could do as an alternative to fix this besides limiting the government but your sentence here:

" “We believe that – for a number of reasons – putting in place appropriate regulatory safeguards for virtual currencies will be beneficial to the long-term strength of the virtual currency industry,” said NYSDFS superintendent Benjamin Lawsky in a statement.

Yet Btc has it's own regulations, and doesn't need to be 'regulated=controlled' by the US Govt! 
Bitcoins  certainly don't need regulation for ""long term strength!""
 
The only 'regulation' they want for Bitcoins is to shut it down!

We have see the results of 'regulation' in the US in the past and the consequences affected the whole world!

 The argument that Btc's are used by the black market is a classic straw man, as the US dollar has been the main currency for illicit activities since it's inception!

Bottom line ..... it is ALL ABOUT CONTROL .... they have control of the worlds primary currency and truly fear losing it to Btcs, which are virtually impossible for them to tax, and definitely beyond their control!

IF the US can't have a big slice of the pie, they sure don't want anyone to have a pie in the first place!

this guy puts it perfectly .....

Bitcoin cannot be regulated – that is kinda the point – there are no records of transactions, there are no charge backs, everything is encrypted. To regulate bitcoin is to shut down bitcoin.

In fact, the nature of NOT being regulated is EXACTLY why bitcoin became popular in the first place – things like people having their deposits taken by banks in Cypress cannot happen on bitcoin. The people of cypress trusted these “regulated financial institutions” which made bad investments, and then had the government hand over their customers money to pay for these investments – straight robbery.

In the USA, the federal reserve continues to print and dump money into the economy, all the while knowing it causes inflation, and lowers the value of the US dollar – the federal reserve is “regulated” also

"1. Individuals and corporations are taxed differently because they are different types of legal entities, not because their means of making money varies.

2.

"The FATF also maintains a [blacklist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FATF_blacklist) for jurisdictions that don't comply with their standards. A sort of... penalization for nation states that don't go along with the global monetary hegemons. This would be the 'stick' portion of the 'stick and carrot' approach that Ms. Shasta Cavalry alluded to in her Banking Subcommittee testimony.

The thing is, the FATF penalties largely rely on restricting access to legacy global banking, wire transfer, and foreign investment infrastructure. The very systems that bitcoin is making redundant and bypassing.

I predict that if bitcoin adoption continues apace in the future, and if FATF attempts to strictly enforce burdensome cryptocurrency standards globally, then the global finance system could start to further balkanize into states that rely largely on the legacy infrastructure of the monetary hegemons, and states that opt to pursue other available opportunities, such as the ones cryptocurrencies provide. In essence, hardline actions by FATF could further spur adoption and reliance on cryptocurrency by states that can't or won't comply.

"> I just gave you money over the web without using any bank, credit card or paypal

and herein lies the rub!   

The US Govt has NO desire to see a 'decentralized' currency that they have NO control over, becoming prevalent in this World, let alone the US!

 The *only* way the US has been so 'successful' has been largely due to the strict CONTROLS placed on the trading of the US dollar by anyone not sanctioned to do so!

The international money markets and associated rules are for the BIG players, if you aren't in that top 0.05%, chances are you never will be ... so they have no 'reason' to cater to the 'little guy'

And they most certainly do not want to see these 'controls' weakened in *any* way, which Bitcoins not only *can do!* by removing the power from their 'central bank' aka The Federal Reserve .... 
which they DO do, by removing the Fed from the equation altogether

The PTB never even considered an electronic currency in their schemes, shit, not even in their *dreams!*

The reality of Bitcoins is that they create an independent decentralized 'authority' which no one controls, and this could be the beginning of the end for fiat currency as we know it, which scares the hell out of TPTB/US Federal Reserve

The US government needs to stop pressuring banks to close accounts for Bitcoin companies quickly, and provide a safe legal basis for Bitcoin companies to operate.

"This is going to get me totally killed, but while stuff like being able to transfer money instantly (and tax free) sounds really good it can also be really dangerous to all forms of government. I've been interested in the idea behind Bitcoin from the tech side for a long time now, but I have to admit that stories like yours make me question whether or not this is all such a great idea.

 I can see how it sounds great to someone who believes in pure capitalism, but if this were to get big (which I don't think it will, for a variety of reasons) it could take out not only government regulatory bodies (which I assume everyone here is against, even though I'm not) but also all of the positive aspects of government. If you can't tax expenditures or transfers you can't tax anything, and without revenues governing becomes really complicated. I suppose that after that it all becomes a discussion of whether or not this would be a good thing, which I firmly feel it wouldn't be, though again I'm sure lots of people here would disagree.

"I'm not a US citizen or anything 

But 

I want you to know that I want bitcoin to be subject to legal scrutiny the same way any other player in the financial world ought to be. 

It seems to me that much of reddit has been enormously hypocritical in demanding that players like HSBC be totally transparent in currency trading whilst demanding that bitcoin be allowed to operate in the dark. 

I do not want it to be a special case, treat it equally to its off line competitors. 

And by this I do not mean 'let them get away with whatever' - I am not pleased with the current regulation of offline currency trading at all. 

I mean tackle both together and legislate to get transparency in to the system so that patterns of facilitating illegal behaviour can be spotted. 

We do not need to know every trade of every individual, but if bulk trades are going via a tax haven or being done by a dodgy arms dealer - you should be able to flag that and investigate. 

This does not have to impact individual privacy, you can use tools like randomised audits. 

People who like the fact that a secretive currency can buy them weed also need to realise it can buy weapons for bad guys and trafficked people - the answer is reforming the laws that make stuff illegal when it ought not to be, not creating a shadow economy.

Should Bitcoin be considered a commodity or speculative stock? In this respect there should be minimal tax and oversight just as we have on Wall Street. Already there are exchanges with tickers constantly running and enabling currency exchanges in multiple cryptocurrencies. These currencies represent an empowerment and non-state controlled option for every individual. Also, would the U.S. ever consider accepting BitCoins as legal tender, much like other countries use the U.S. dollar as their primary currency?

"Personally, I think bitcoin has the potential to stop or mitigate illegal activity. And help make society much more honest and efficient.

These, in my opinion are some benefits.

1. Ultimate accountability. Every transaction is public and you can basically follow the money. Goes for government too... we can watch where our tax bitcoins are going. 

2. Great for accounting. IRS would love this because, well, a real tax picture can be made by seeing how much individuals and corporations are making and spending. (granted that people register their bitcoin IDs or wallets)

3. Real time metrics. By being able to follow the money, you can have a real-time picture of what works and what doesn't.

4. Taking power away from banks and putting it back to the government. Just looking at Europe, poorer countries are subject to the ECB. By being able to see how the money flows, we can have a better way of seeing what is wrong economically and thus, repairing any blight.

5. Stopping terrorism. You would be able to see how terror networks can be funded. From primary, to secondary to tertiary sources. Bill buys gas from Shell which uses its coins to pay for land rights in Nigeria and you can follow the flow of coins to some official who pays off a local warlord to help him control problems who pays tribute to alqueda.

"Senator Moran,

Thanks again for taking the time to talk with us today here on /r/Bitcoin. I enjoyed watching the coverage of the hearing, and would like to give a short response on some of the issues regarding this online payment system. 

First of all Ms. Tunstall claimed that ""there is no need for anonymity in Bitcoin."" This is very much untrue and although this aspect is taken advantage of, it has legit reasons.

In order for the Bitcoin network to be effective there must be an online PUBLIC ledger. This prevents someone from accidentally using a coin more than once. Now, If a person's address was associated with their name all of their financial transactions would be broadcast for the entire internet to see. If I needed to buy something like a wig, medication or something else I wished to keep private it would be broadcast over the web, and most people would not like this. For this reason Bitcoin's anonymity is very much necessary.";4;1;False;rodentbaiter;cdio516;I’m one of the Senators attending today's U.S. Senate Banking Committee hearing related to bitcoin.

"I'd like to run through a few common counter arguments and misconceptions:

 
###A large proportion of Bitcoin opposers think because the early adopters made a lot of money it must be a pyramid scheme. 

Bitcoin, by design behaves in exactly the opposite manner to pyramid scheme, instead of following exponential growth (and inevitable crash), the supply of bitcoin is following a [reciprocal curve](http://www.mattwhitlock.com/Bitcoin%20Inflation.png).

###Some people believe that because Bitcoins are not backed by anything they are not worth anything
US Dollars aren't backed by anything either. All currencies are valued only by their users in regards to their usefulness and availability. But unlike with any conventional currencies there is no risk of them being affected by a large increase in supply (like what happened to Ugandan Shilling).
 
### Many sceptics believe bitcoins are ""Created out of thin air"" and therefore can be devalued by a huge increase huge increase in supply by a creator.
 
The new Bitcoins are given to ""miners"" who essentially solve a mathematical problem equivalent to throwing 100 dice and the if 16 of them land on one (Approximately 1 in 5 quintillion chance) they are rewarded with a few Bitcoins. Thousands of people all over the world are trying this millions of times a second and the first one to do it is rewarded with a few new Bitcoins. The only way someone could manipulate the supply is by spending literally millions of dollars on equipment to reliably beat everyone else in the race.
 
###Another argument against Bitcoin is they are not safe because ""X amount of Bitcoins have been lost from service Y"".

There has never been any stolen money from a vulnerability in bitcoin network or the official wallet!

Bitcoins (like with all currency) are only as secure as where they are stored, If you entrust your Bitcoins to anyone else, just like with any other currency there is no [guarantee you will see that money again](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_U.S._bank_failures).

Under current economic models, this would result in them being a lousy currency long term. The reason is that due to the built in deflation, Bitcoins encourage hording rather then spending them, which makes them ill suited to be a currency.

"There's something I'd like you to know that hasn't really been mentioned in this thread yet.

Forget about bitcoins and money for a moment. The crytograhpic decentralized ledger system that bitcoin uses represents the real innovation here. It is in essence a method for guaranteeing the ownership and transmission of *property* in a safe, secure way without the need for a third party mediator of any kind. With bitcoin, litecoin, and others this system is being applied to money.

In the future it will also be applied to other forms of property, of all kinds, whenever and wherever individual-to-individual transactions are beneficial and preferred. It's going to change a lot more about commerce than money itself, given time, and it's going to evolve.

Yes, many of us disagree. All the good things the government does it does by monopolizing those things, providing the shitty, high-priced service that monopolies always provide, and obfuscating the cost by socializing it. If Bitcoin cripples governments' ability to do that, it will do so by enabling the provision of those things in a non-coercive, non-monopolistic manner.

"Ooh con law time! I'm nobody's lawyer!

So the US is divided up a bunch of different ways, one of those being the federal gov't and the state governments. Both get to make laws, but what if they don't agree somehow? Well, taxpayers pay some lawyers a shit ton of money, and ten years down the line, somebody gets rich!

The Constitution lays out what the feds can do, everything else not on the list belongs to something else. So, you play mental gymnastics with the rules and you end up with something like the situation with cars. The feds regulate safety and emissions standards ... but once the vehicle's sold, the states can either have it inspected yearly or just say fuckall. The state gets to register cars and license drivers. Hmm? 

Well, the constitution talks about interstate commerce, but it doesn't talk about roads really. So, as the car became popular, states beat the feds to the punch, and put licensing and road regulations in place. Since they are already doing it, it would be difficult for the feds to wrassle that control from them, no matter how they frame it. Similarly, the feds are in a better position and have a good peg to hang the interstate commerce power hat on when it comes to regulating the safety of vehicles sold nationwide.

Of course, that's a extreme oversimplification. There's many other federal powers and legal schemes involved. But it applies here - the internet's new. Traditionally, states regulate businesses like MTB's. The feds, for bitcoin anyway, are still not in the game. But what if tomorrow they said oh no, bitcoin's cool anyone can sell it? Well now we need to drag the lawyers out again and have a good ol' fashioned supreme court case! Nobody likes to let go of their power, and a power vacuum can be just as bad. Just look at pot legislation. 
Do YOU wanna open up a business that's legal when the feds might shitstomp it? Or worse - the feds come to shitstomp it and the state troopers come have a gunfight over it?
