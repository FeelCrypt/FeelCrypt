"it's mostly used in speculation and as an store of value. usage for daily purchases is very low. some accept bitcoin already though, for example to buy computer games. but adoption is increasing. we are still in the very beginning.

the usual way to get bitcoin is buying it through an exchange. For example localbitcoin, coinbase (US/EU) or gemini (US). after buying more than just for a few bucks to play with, you should use a hardware wallet (Trezor, ledger nano s). Otherwise you can use a less secure hot wallet on your smartphone.";2;1;False;Hanspanzer;e52zwds;Cheers!;9au41d;https://i.redd.it/hmzbd5az5qi11.jpg
