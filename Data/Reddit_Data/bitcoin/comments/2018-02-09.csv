"**Dutch Sandwich**

A Dutch Sandwich is a tax avoidance strategy used by some multinational corporations to lower their corporate tax liability. The strategy uses payments between related entities in a corporate structure to shift income from a higher-tax country to a lower-tax country.

In a Dutch Sandwich, revenues from sales of a product shipped by an Irish company are booked by a shell company in the Netherlands, taking advantage of generous tax laws there. This is usually the second part of the scheme referred to as the ""Double Irish with Dutch Sandwich"".

At first that made me think negatively about NASA, but then I sat back and realized that everything is iterative. Without NASA, there would be no moon landing. Without NASA, there would be no robots on mars. Without NASA, there would be no... spacex.

"That’s the beauty of living in the free world, you don’t have to work for anyone you don’t want to. Or at all if you don’t want. 
Just the same as the SpaceX employees. They are given stock in the company, 3 weeks paid holiday, free medical, dental, and vision care. and most of all, a chance to be a part of something that is changing history. 
If they think it’s unfair, they are free to leave, no one is forcing them to work at the company. 
Having a leader that works just as hard (if not harder) as all his employees goes a long way when working as a team. If your team believe in you and respect you, you and them can achieve great things.
SpaceX has a rating of 4.1 out of 5 on the glassdoor website which is an anonymous review site that the employees can rate the company. That’s quite high for any company of that size. 
Again, I’m not knocking anyone who doesn’t want to work any harder than the bare minimum of what’s expected. 
But we do need people with vision who are willing to go above and beyond if we are to push humanity forward.

EDIT: lol so I’m getting downvoted for suggesting that there’s nobility in working hard for yourself and a company that has actual vision and is changing the face of humanity?

"Seriously... fuck off with that nonsense. That might be one of the most over-perpetuated rumors in existence currently.  Most doctors and nurses that work at VAs take 20-30% less money to deal with an arguably more difficult patient base and the legal complications that come with it. Anesthesiologists at the VA top out at like... 325 or 350, which is BELOW the median salary for the job and well into the bottom 3rd currently. Same is true with ortho, radiology, and cardiac. ... and all those folks work fucking hard.  I've never met a VA nurse or doc who didn't bust their absolute ass for their mission of caring for vets. Sure the bureaucracy sucks, but that could all be handled with actual leadership (which comes from an actual budget and talent).

The legal teams that fight on behalf of the veterans at the VAs are also severely underpaid relative to their peers. The fact of the matter is, just go to the VAs website. Look at all those drop-down menus, services, and things they handle for veterans.  

This agency should be run top-to-bottom with a massive budget and people putting their ""money where their mouth is"" with regard to our veterans, but, year after year, assholes spend so much time talking about how much of a shithole it is instead of recognizing that their top talent all take massive pay cuts to provide for our veterans. Something that congress, news stations, and keyboard 'kings' fail to understand.  If you want the VA to be less of a ""trainwreck"" to deal with, give them more than a shoestring budget and the talent will come.  



Edit: My point being, they do well with what they have. Just check out the amount of openings they cannot fill because of their shitty pay/benefits packages relative to private hospitals. There are hundreds of openings for skilled physicians across the country, but they just simply don't pay enough.  Even on the admin side, there's no comparable hospital offering a 10+ year (requirement) medical director position only 185-205k (with a 300k max over time). That's a 250-285+k starting position, 200+k at a tiny, tiny rural location.

"NASA had its budget cut drastically, that's what.  Money matters:  when the Apollo moon program was proposed, the Vice-President Lyndon Johnson asked the fairly new NASA director, James Webb, how much he thought it would cost.  He thought $10 billion was needed, so he told Johnson $20 billion because he was afraid that if there were cost overruns and not enough money, safety would be compromised greatly.  In comparison, the replacement for the Apollo system, the space shuttle, was meant to be a cheaper alternative, and the design chosen was a much cheapened, by 50%, version of the cheap, using solid rocket boosters instead of only liquid fueled engines.  And the administration that introduced the shuttle didn't like the space program in general.  Also the space shuttle was expected to fly much, much more than it did, so the cost savings never materialized.

NASA's main goal is not to build rockets. It's main goal is to further our understanding of the universe and develop tech that helps to accomplish these goals. Tons of these goals could never be accomplished through private industry because there is simply no profit in it. One company in the private sector has surpassed NASA in chemical rocket development but without multiple entities that can compete with each other the sls will continue to be developed. Someday when multiple private industries can taxi NASA's experiments to space then they will stop making chemical rockets and focus on the next tech that is out of reach of industry. ;1;0;False;Drummend;dtzeryc;This video of old school astronauts criticizing Elon saying he'll fail reminds me of Warren Buffett and others saying Crypto will fail;7wavza;https://youtu.be/CyGqMZQAMio

"Nop. It is not even close to being the final nail in the coffin. 

The government requires TWO launch providers to consider themselves capable of taking care of issues of national security. 

There was only one provider... ULA... with two rockets (Atlas, and the uber expensive Delta). 

Now there are actually two providers, ULA and SpaceX. For some launches ULA still remains the sole provider (that will probably change soon). 

The nail in the coffin for ULA is when a third launch provider (with a heavy vehicle) arrives. 

And that is fairly uncertain at this point. 

In the meantime, ULA will live, and the shareholders will keep squeezing that ""capabilities contract"" until they can't anymore. Then lockheed and boeing will move to the next fighter jet or something.

"> i think people these days are probably way more open to big government, willing to accept it and encourage it than generations previous, dont you think?

I think things are a bit more polarized now (or at least it sure seems that way).. and largely that perception is driven by how effectively different groups use social-media and the Internet to try to drive a certain ""narrative"". 

I think if you ask the average-joe on the street,.. the vast majority of people are just trying to keep their head down, pay their bills.. and survive. (I personally do things where I can (joined the ACLU, am a member of the EFF, donate money to local food-banks and etc)... and try to keep myself as aware/educated as I can about local (and Federal) issues that might effect me. 

I don't necessarily think people want ""big government"",.. I think there's just a wide diversity of people who all want different things:

* Disabled or at-risk people.. want more services that benefit them. 

* Parents want more services/money going into schools. 

* Veterans want more services/money going into Military Hospitals and Retirement

* Culture and Arts people want more services/money going into culture and arts related things. 

* People who depend on public-transport.. want more services/money going into that. 

So you have this ""being stretched in all directions"" problem... where Government is expected to ""do everything for everybody"".. which really isn't a realistic expectation. 

And that dynamic is what fuels disagreements about Gov-spending/budgets and which programs we should fund and which programs end up getting scaled back. 

A certain % of people believe in ""as little Gov as possible"".. but they also don't understand that the O&M (basic ""Operations & Management"") of foundational services (Police, Fire, Roads, Water, Electricity).. is always growing and getting more diverse.. because the population is always growing and getting more diverse. 

I'm 44yrs old... so I probably skew a little older than the typical Reddit demographic. I certainly don't want to see ""big government"".. and I definitely don't want to see ""wasteful government"". 

However I do think with all the technology and innovation and creativity in our brains.. there absolutely must be ways we can leverage technology and new ideas to provide all the things society wants.. and still be fair and sustainable and efficient. 

I don't want to sound to socialist/communistic... but it's difficult for me to mentally parse a society where we have people that live in 10million mansions on the waterfront... and people who live on skid-row sometimes in clothes stained with their own shit. That disparity is shameful I think. 

We have all the technology and resources we need to solve most of the problems we already face. Hell.. we've probably had that for decades now. The problem isn't lack of resources.. the problem is our acceptance of ignorance and shameful behavior.

"The point is, Buffet is great when it comes to old-school industries, but is by no means an oracle when it comes to cutting edge technology.

">  Tech startups should focus on growth, not profits.

Exactly. Amazon, Twitter, and SnapChat all have never posted a profitable quarter, yet they continue to encourage massive investment.

This is because the moment you post profit, it's all investors care about, and losing profit seems to be backwards progress. Instead companies like Amazon focus on actually spending more than they make. This is why Amazon regularly gives new plans for it's far flung futuristic ideas, because it is actually willing to spend the money to try some of them.

So Top Gear scaring away investors was an important blow to the company, as the weren't driven away by Elon alone at least. They definitely weren't scared away by his growth focus.

"**The Missionary Position: Mother Teresa in Theory and Practice**

The Missionary Position: Mother Teresa in Theory and Practice is an essay by the British-American journalist and polemicist Christopher Hitchens published in 1995.

It is a critique of the work and philosophy of Mother Teresa, the founder of an international Roman Catholic religious congregation, and it challenges the mainstream media's assessment of her charitable efforts. In length 128 pages, it was re-issued in paperback and ebook form with a foreword by Thomas Mallon in 2012.

The book's thesis, as summarized by one critic, was that ""Mother Teresa is less interested in helping the poor than in using them as an indefatigable source of wretchedness on which to fuel the expansion of her fundamentalist Roman Catholic beliefs."" The response to Hitchens's arguments fell largely upon ideological lines, with some critics contesting his evidence and others his understanding of the religious phenomenon Mother Teresa represented.

"""Freedom of choice"" ... sure, I worked at a startup where 60-80 hours weeks is a ""choice"".  Sitting in a 30$ wal-mart chair for 12 hours a day.   

Then there's this guy who practically lives there, totally gets off on ""we're making great things"" mantra. Always looks at you on the way out the door:  ""Oh you're leaving early today"" when it's 7pm and your back hurts from sitting in the aforementioned chair.

This dude is fairly well connected, when you hear him say that you cringe.  You realize that if he alone decides to disrepute you it may be hard to maintain work in this industry. That's just one unknown you don't want to deal with. 

After a couple months you realize you've strapped yourself to some proverbial missile that you have no parachute to get off of.  Since it's a startup they're paying you half your market value (if even!) but the bills are now slipping and you're going into debt.

""But nobody has a gun pointed at their head"" - Sure you can say that, but by the time you realize you need to bail, you've missed your moment to do so. There's no financial security anymore, and while you can look for a job, you know you'll get fired if you put in less than 50hours this week, and maybe what you can do is start showing up earlier than anyone else, so it ""look"" like you're there longer... (which I did from time to time) You also find out that ""that one guy"" is totally watching internet traffic, and he asked you why you were browsing linked-in so much.  But sure, there's no ""gun to your head""

""Well you obviously didn't have what it takes to work there"" - I managed for a year, sleeping on conference tables from time to time during ""crunches"" I finally managed to leave as a straight exchange to another startup, which was a total shit show (but that's another story).   There were only 2 coders who managed to stay the long haul, the CTO even bailed to get away from the environment.

""You could have left"" - Sure, and then be stuck in limbo, nobody likes working at a place for 3-6mo and then leaving.  You have to explain that to your next employer, so could have left.  And If I don't find a replacement job quickly, I could have also lost my house, my car, my storage facilities and moved back into my grandparents house, 200 miles away.   That sounds super appealing.

I think the worst of the experiences I had, was I realized how much I didn't know about what I was signing up for in the first place.  That's the worst, and that's why so many people find the relationships like this so unfair and unreasonable, when you finally get involved with them, it's like an abusive partner whom you're fiscally indebted to.  The rules are different than what you thought they were going to be, and were explained what they would be in the first place.

**You live you learn ya know?** And while my ramblings may not appeal to your sensibilities, realize that I'm only pointing out the one absurd realtionship I had with a startup.

"Thank you for your very well written and informative answer!

I think you may have slightly misunderstood the intent of my post, I wasn't attempting to directly link sex with love and trust; rather the opposite, I was attempting to draw what I believe to be a connection between our genetic predispositions for partnership & sexuality and the love & trust that are essential elements in the intimate relationships we build.

Being vulnerable is one of, if not the biggest point itself of a relationship imo, discussing issues that you don't trust anyone else with, opening up about your emotions and displaying your insecurities and weaknesses. I believe that if an average person doesn't have another human being at their side that takes on this role, they can't be fully happy on a personal level.

What I mean by this is have NASA only work on payloads and truly experimental stuff like new tech and materials. Let SpaceX take care of delivery.

Also what we need is to stop this one off space probe/lander/rover crap, we need to start thinking about this as assembly line with iterative design, just start building 5 of each every year.

NASA should kick into high gear with some of the advance probe missions to planets and moons and leave the logistics of payload delivery to private enterprise.  To me, if we could very soon get Curiosity-like missions to Titan and Europa which is sending us back relevant data, then that would be a big win in my perception of where we should be at this particular stage in time.

No need to suffer for some pitiful 5% piece of the company, or insider shares that are worth nothing now with hopes to be worth more one day, at the expense of your livelihood and your family and your social life. 

The trick is to aim for the company that is slightly above startup stage, thus you have a good opportunity for growth in the company. They are growing but aren't too big and entrenched yet.

It's a stupid, lazy, 'hand-wavy' statement that people throw out because they're too goddamn lazy or ignorant to *try* to understand anything with nuance. Fits right in with the 'black and white' way of thinking - nothing is black and white.

[edit] A friend said something that I think explains this much better: 'Freedom of choice' does not mean 'freedom from consequences.' Whether or not someone has freedom of choice is not an argument - the only argument to be made is the particular qualities or quantities of consequences, and whether or not they are worth the improvement in quality of life.

I used to live the exact scenario you are describing and it's a personal hell. For basically 4 years I lived in my room with barely any contact to other people. I had tricked myself into thinking that I am happy this way, that I am naturally a loner, that I don't need affection or affirmation.

It was a lie I told myself, not more and not less. Telling myself that and *choosing to believe it* made that situation bearable for me, at the time.

"MEMS main advantage is low cost for the degree of precision they provide, but I think there were accelerometers precise to a thousandth of m/s² by that time. Not going to argue about the class of control loop that requires landing the boosters, tho I have a gut feeling it's no different than the normal case of controlled rocket propulsion with shifting centre of mass, or reactive landing of Lunar Excursion Module.

LEM actually highlights how little computing power there's needed. It was 1960s embedded computing tech; by the end of 1970s you'd have an advantage of a decade of Moore's law. Also, you can achieve quite a lot with a speicalized computing device even with otherwise primitive component base.

Also, consider that noone did booster landing say in 2000, when tech was not very different from today and most definitely up to the task.

"Many business founders are that way. I worked for three years at a startup whose founders had that attitude. I would call both of them great guys.

A lot of the complaining about this kind of thing comes from people who are bad with boundaries. They treat their employers as authority figures, a kind of personal way of relating to them that goes well beyond any employer/employee contract. As a result, they seek approval in forms other than monetary compensation, and are very sensitive to pressure about things like working hours. They don't negotiate their working conditions, they accept them, and instead of proactively addressing them, they complain to anyone who'll listen. Outside of extreme cases, it's basically meaningless. Complainers gonna complain.

> That kind of work ethic is not reasonable to expect from people that being paid total shit salaries.

""Expect"" is a key factor here. ""Expecting"" in business would be little more effective than wishing, if it weren't for how sensitive many people are to those expectations. From one perspective, you could say that business management exploits people's weaknesses in these areas for their profit. And they do. But from another perspective, the management of big businesses are running organizations that keep tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of people employed. That takes hard decisions that often are literally incomprehensible to the people whose understanding of business is limited to showing up regularly, doing their work, and getting paid perfectly regularly. They treat that deal as a kind of law of the universe, but it only works as long as business owners are making hard decisions about their lives that they often don't understand.

One factor in all of this is that the US is not a particularly friendly country to employees. Labor laws are nowhere near as protective of employees as they are in most western European countries, for example. This means that companies are able to demand more from their employees, and that becomes part of the competitive environment that businesses have to respond to. If you want to build a new, large business that competes with other large businesses, particularly in areas like cars and spaceflight which are basically oligopolies, you have to compete on a level that's consistent with the environment. If SpaceX and Tesla treated its employees the way some large, mature, established businesses do, they would fail.

So the choice is basically along the lines of ""should companies like Tesla and SpaceX exist?"" If you don't think they should, then you're basically saying that the status quo should remain as is, with oligopolies consisting of companies like Ford and GM, Boeing and Lockheed Martin, that are not advancing their field very much, particularly if no-one else is forcing them to. But if you answer yes, then you have to recognize that working at those disruptive companies will not be a cakewalk. It's the nature of the beast. Putting it personally on the founders is misguided.

"> What makes you think the private sector would be more corrupt?

Because the private sector isn't providing the service just to provide the service. They're providing the service to make a profit. If they can't make a profit they can't run their business.

Also I skimmed the paper but it does gloss over a lot of issues. Like they mention for-profit judges in Greece. They then say (emphasis mine):

> For-profit-judges ***competitively*** drafted rulings to reach mutually agreeable terms and ***the general population served as a reputational check upon judges, plaintiffs and defendants.***

First ""competitively""? What was keeping the judges from co-operating with each other to raise profits? Companies do that a lot. There was that recent Silicon Valley scandal where companies decided to secretly agree not to hire each others' employees to keep salaries down and prevent employees from shopping around for better benefits. Second of all, what was this ""reputational check""? If you expand this onto a larger scale, how would a reputational check work when judges and the police are both for-profit and working with each other?

&nbsp;

>It's because you're biased to think that profit is bad, and if a group of people operate ""not for profit"" then they're less corruptible, which just isn't true.

You're drawing the wrong conclusion. Profit isn't bad. But providing basic services should not be a for-profit venture. Imagine if the roads in front of your house were bought and you were charged a toll to leave your house? Or, worse yet, you just weren't allowed on the roads?

What if the water source for your city was privately owned? What would prevent them from jacking up the prices? What if you got a good deal with them but your neighbor, under whose house the water pipes ran, decided to not let you have access to it?

&nbsp;

Imagine if your house was on fire and you had to call the fire department but they wouldn't come over because your life savings just went up in smoke?

&nbsp;

And abolition of all government in general? What, like private minting of money and you having to worry about who takes what currency and if your property is actually yours until the guy with more guns and resources comes over and claims it as his own?

"Re people who ""quit or hate it there"", that's to be expected at companies like that. They're in the process of disrupting some of the largest oligopolies in American business - cars and aerospace. You can't do that by running a company as though it were a mature, established business. I've addressed that further in [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7wavza/this_video_of_old_school_astronauts_criticizing/du01ogv/).

> Elon gets all the credit, but it’s the people that work for him that are the unsung heroes. 

Can you name a big company that publicly credits its employees? That's not how it generally works.

> He’s the top 10%

How many people would you say are in the same group as him? I think 1,000 would be pushing it - there aren't 1,000 people in the US with that kind of achievement record. If you pick 1,000, that puts him in the top 0.0003% within the US.

If you go by net worth, he's #80 on Forbes' global list of billionaires. That puts him in the top 0.000001%, worldwide.

>  I’m betting he won’t stick around for Tesla.

What does that even mean? He founded Tesla in 2003, so has been there for nearly 15 years.

> This guy is in it for himself.

No-one accused him of running a charity.

> He lost my respect after saying all that shite about public transportation. Well fix it, rock star. 

What are you talking about? He founded the Boring Company and is in the process of getting into that business. Do you want him to wave a magic wand? 

In the real world, the way you wave that wand is by starting companies and finding employees who are willing to work hard to help change the world. You can't have it both ways. It takes time, like the 15+ years that both Tesla and SpaceX have been in business.

Humans became a dominant species because of their social capacity and societal organization - not because they could reproduce most efficiently.

I'm not saying that your conclusion is wrong; just that it's not a logical derivation from your premise.  While the goal of life is to procreate, it's not inherently the goal of the individual.

Also, while I disagree with the extent (""more than life itself""), you can still love and trust someone that you're not procreating with and that may still be a critical desire in the human experience.";5;1;False;Disbfjskf;dtzfrkt;This video of old school astronauts criticizing Elon saying he'll fail reminds me of Warren Buffett and others saying Crypto will fail;7wavza;https://youtu.be/CyGqMZQAMio

"Mass incarceration is a result of prisons being treated as a public good, not a result of private prisons. 

Governments seeks to expand and acquire resources as well, and without the limitations imposed on private corporations. The people who build prisons, the people who sell them supplies and food, the guards, law enforcement, all have a vested interest in keeping people in prison and lobby the government for harsher sentences for victimless crimes. Government workers don't want to be out of jobs. Suppliers want to sell them more stuff, and governments provide an endless stream of money. This is the cause of corruption and mass incarceration. It doesn't matter if the prison is ""privately"" owned. The state ultimately decides who to imprison, and the corruption is totally legal and socially accepted. The solution isn't to treat prisons a public good, but to privatize every aspect of law enforcement.

"Apparently the astronauts were not as critical of SpaceX as portrayed by that report but were worried about lightly-supervised private for-profit companies possibly not being concerned enough about safety.  Notice that SpaceX (and Orbital Sciences) uses graphite-plastic wrapped helium tanks, which are not considered as safe as all-metal tanks, and one did explode during the fueling process.  Also SpaceX wants to start fueling their rockets in less than an hour before liftoff, meaning while any humans are already on board.  

Decades earlier, NASA astronauts were critical of the space shuttle, and I think  Wally Schirra called it unsafe junk (after it flew but before Challenger exploded).  
 
As for anybody who thinks space rockets are much better than they used to be, they're running the same fuels and materials that were used in the 1960s, and only the electronics have improved drastically.  The failure rate used to be about 1 in 10 to 1 in 100, something nobody expects to improve drastically, and Elon Musk himself said something about raising it to 1 in 500.

"> Similar thing happened with Tesla in its early years, Top Gear...

I'm a big Tesla fan, but they also failed to meet on their deadline, had tons of hurdles with the chassis, raised the costs of the Roadster before delivery etc... Clarkson is a clown, albeit an entertaining one, there were more reasons than that as to why investors/early adopters got cold feet. 

Also, the roadster was overheating at its premier launch, and had to be swapped as they were cooling it down with ice. Tesla's history is all the more interesting because of these setbacks, and despite being an anarcho-capitalist I can give them a pass (albeit hard to swallow) for the DOE grants because at the end of the day because their very existence has done more good than harm to disrupt the war machine and its dependence on oil.

"> Could you blame investors for pulling out of the CEO doesn’t care about profits?

Yes. Tech startups should focus on growth, not profits. Only a bad CEO would focus on profits instead of expanding the scale.

> It’s not like they’re investing their money for charity purposes

Tesla investment can pay off only in the long term. However, investors can already profit by selling shares on the secondary market. They do not need for Tesla to be profitable to profit from their investment.

> I can assure you an astute businessman like Elon absolutely does car about profits

Tesla is still not profitable and relies on borrowing and raising capital. And yet it has enormous market capitalization. So investors are fine with what Elon is doing.

"> Elon absolutely does care about profits, or his board would fire him considering Tesla is a public company and they represent the shareholders not him.

After his ousting as CEO at Paypal I read that he has set up all his companies in such a way that he cannot be ousted, furthermore, only Tesla is a publicly traded company; and even something he wished he could have avoided. He isn't even paid for being CEO of Tesla until he fulfills his goals of the latest Master Plan. 

I don't think he doesn't care about profits at all, so much as its him willing to go for a moonshot (Master Plan) and make the compromises necessary to post-pone them if need-be; Tesla just recorded its worst quarter this month and still traded at above 335, and is still likely to meet revised Model 3 production expectations. They changed the game with th Model 3 deposit system, nothing in all of automotive history even comes close to doing what they did on scale alone, with sight unseen!

If you got out as soon as he blew his kiss of doom, you were sitting very pretty to have bought the dip to $6K and expand your positions after the bloodshed in the streets, which on the flipside, is when Buffett says you should go in.

Why not? You already rely on them for everything else, e.g. Apple, Google, Samsung, Toyota, etc.

That would only happen if governments incentivise them to move overseas.

Forgive me if this sounds incendiary or to controversial but what has NASA been doing to us all these decades since the moon race? If SpaceX is proven anything its that traditional rocket designs were always more efficient than the space shuttle model. I don't see any reason why what SpaceX is doing now couldn't have been done back in the 1970s. For one most of their manufacturing is done internally so they don't have to outsource to numerous external vendors which have all their additional administrative costs. Two they're of course recovering there hardware. NASA landed the Viking probes on Mars in the 1970s so I don't think it's out of the realm of reason to think that NASA couldn't have landed a first stage on a drone ship out in the Atlantic. I think the difference today is that they're incentivized to do more with less because of budget cuts. Pressure makes the diamonds, as they say.

That's not true at all. Places like NASA develop technologies that would obviously fail in the private industry and once they are further developed they release the information to the public for free. Without NASA's role in rocket development and the enormous subsidies and paydays they give SpaceX then it would have failed horribly. It's just a fact that some technologies will not make any money without generations of development through government work. ;1;0;False;Drummend;dtze26l;This video of old school astronauts criticizing Elon saying he'll fail reminds me of Warren Buffett and others saying Crypto will fail;7wavza;https://youtu.be/CyGqMZQAMio
"> There is nothing...nothing...the government can do that the private sector can’t do better and cheaper.

The problem with this logic.. is you're making a broad sweeping generalization about organizations that's not 100%/universally true. 

* There are examples of Governmental-organizations and private-organizations.. that do amazing work (efficient, frugal, effective, quality,..etc)

and

* There are also examples of Governmental-organizations and private-organizations.. that are greedy or wasteful or harmful to the environment or just flat unethical. 

In my career.. I spent the first 15 or so years of jobs working in the private-sector.. and I've spent the most recent 10 years working for a city-gov. The city-gov I work for now -- is by far the more sustainable and efficient and more ""well-rounded"" in how they look at squeezing the most results out of every single nook/cranny/niche or angle of what we do. For the past 5 to 10 years... the city-gov I work in.. has been showing 2% to 3% gains in efficiency... every year.... year after year. That whole mantra of ""do more with less""... and continuing to ""do more with less"".. and pushing harder and hard and HARDER every year to ""do more with less""... is pretty much all we think about. 

Not only that.. but our entire budget is transparent and posted online for any citizen to look at.. and it's available 24/7/365. 

We've adopted a whole bunch of different Processes & Policies... such as:

* the TBL (""Triple Bottom Line"").. which is a way of approaching a problem to make sure that no matter how you fix it... that it's financially-sound,.. socially-fair.. and environmentally-safe. 

* we have a ""Budgeting for Outcomes"" philosophy.. that says whatever solutions we decide on.. must be driven by Data/facts.. and the progress and outcomes must be measurable and enforced. 

* we have various different teams (Innovation Team, Sustainability Team, etc).. that are constantly looking at various things we're doing.. and looking for ways to eliminate wastefulness and inefficiency. 

Most of the various employees and coworkers I am around.. are some of the hardest working people I've ever seen. (sacrificing days-off, volunteering, donating their own money,etc,etc)... and a big part of that is driven by the fact that we're citizens in the same community we work for. It wouldn't make any sense for us to ""cheap out"" on Police or Fire.. because we (individually) depend on those. It wouldn't make any sense for us to take shortcuts on Water or Power.. because we (individually) depend on those too. etc..etc...

I think you should look up the expected value formula and definition. Your odds of a return are based on the total number of outcomes and how likely those outcomes are. In Vegas every game you bet a dollar you have an EV of less than a dollar. In roulette if you put a dollar on red your EV is $0.947. In crypto this is far less black and white. But even so, insinuating that only 1 out of 1300 cryptos will be a good bet is a bit ridiculous when you consider the overall growth of the space and that very few people have lost money if they have stayed in the market for a few years, regardless of their coin choice. I don’t think it will always be that way, and every coin certainly will not survive.

Lol you’re a fucking moron it’s pointless to argue with you. I then mentioned people in low cost of living areas who have 100k homes and a reasonable salary say 150k combined. They can save 2 mil by 40 if they so choose through smart investing and tax advantaged accounts. Yeah you say you know them but do you know their net worth? Maybe their lifestyle and spending habits exceeds their ability to save for retirement so they are forced to keep working to keep up. Or maybe they just like their jobs enough to stay. You said in your first post that it would take you 30 years to spend 2 million after 65 and then I prove you wrong by saying you will have more than that in your account when you die from investment returns in stocks and bonds.

"This is true for many cryptocurrencies, but there are some coins doing some exciting things in IoT, cross border payments systems to eliminate all the wasted capital sitting in nostro/vostro accounts, and many others fields.

Go check out IOTAs AMA with Bosch, they have partnered and are doing some very exciting things. They've also partnered with Taipei to convert it into a smart city with automated m2m transactions (obviously will take awhile). They also have a partnership with VAG (Volkswagen Group), their vision is to be the company facilitating the payment system for self driving cars and are well on their way to doing so (just one example).

But for sale, it will be treated on a provincial level. In Ontario we have an LCBO(Liquor Control Board of Ontario) and Beer Store that have exclusive rights to sell beer, wine and liquor. They are owned by the government of Ontario. So basically you can't get beer or wine at a convenience store. HOWEVER, alcohol laws are starting to loosen so you can purchase only beer in some grocery stores around Ontario.

Marijuana will be treated similarly as well. It will be regulated and sold by the government of Ontario. However, there are of course private companies supplying to the dispensaries. You can also order online. Hopefully this changes and small businesses are able to open up shop.

"Last response because I honestly think you are one of the type that thinks they are right, but refuses to research their claims. Just google the question “how dividends impact stock prices”. Take Johnson&Johnson, Coca Cola, and McDonalds. They have increased dividends every year and their stock continues to climb. AAPL says they are going to start dividen and guess what? Stock goes up. BUT BUT they should go down since they are giving more money away!!!

No, because companies who cut dividends... well their stock drops. Companies give dividends because they have so much fucking cash, so much that they can’t use it all to grow the company because it’s already too big. However, I guess companies having so much money that they can’t even spend it should save it, because maybe Apple should hoarse the 270 BILLION they have just sitting in the bank... using it would be a liability.

But Bitcoin and other crypto is basically throwing resource into nothing, at least when you put in a company stock you invest in the economy and industry and things that produce tangible things. Bitcoin just burns electricity to create no value but arbitrary tokens, which hopefully can be traded for fiat. Bitcoin especially is problematic in a sense that unlike fiat where investing in economy is more profitable due to inflationary nature, the deflationary nature of bitcoin rewards people for inducing economic stagnation. This might be good for holder of bitcoin, but economy has to move for poor people to have at least some basic job and income, none of it which happens when you invest in bitcoin. ;1;0;False;NeuroticKnight;dtzaosu;Millennials Love Bitcoin And Hate Stocks;7w4731;https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2018/02/millennials-love-bitcoin-and-hate-stocks/

At the moment there is no way to purchase cannabis without it being mailed... that being said we have dispensaries that operate on the sidelines in a grey area until federal recreation legalization in summer 2018.

Have you ever done the retirement math before?  Even if you wait till age 65 to retire, you must assume you have 30 more years to live.  So let's say you built up 2 million dollars at age 65.  That means you have less than 66,000 to spend per year or you go broke before 95.  Then realize the cost of living by the time you're that age will be much higher than it is today, as well as the insane cost of healthcare for seniors.  So if you wanna talk shit about retiring at 30 or age 40, just shut the fuck up.

I can tell you right now, though, that I didn't have an income where it was possible to put money like that away when I was 18.

"When you buy stock, you buy shares, but even if you own 75% of the shares that does not mean that you own 75% of the assets.  
They are 100% owned by the corporation.  Stock holders do not own corporations because the law treats them as people.  You can not own people anymore.  
You also can not walk into a company and start taking chairs, for example.  In that sense, what you buy is only worth what other people are willing to buy it for at that time.

No, that's a damn good trade off sir. Did you actually get those suicidal thoughts and what not while you were taking it?

I went to eCigs back before they were widely available at the tail end of 2009 and switched to them exclusively. I kept using them for years, lowering my dosage little by little in the last 2 years I used them until I got to the lowest dose available. I quit in August of 2016 and the first month was the roughest. I'm no spring chicken, but after a few weeks, I realized I got a lot of my energy from nicotine.;2;0;False;Main_Tank;dtyjkqd;Thanks to the recent dip and consistent dollar cost averaging over the past 7 months, I have finally reached my goal of owning one whole bitcoin.;7w06ui;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7w06ui/thanks_to_the_recent_dip_and_consistent_dollar/
great and in about 2 months, you will regret this decision entirely. because bitcoin will have lost another 3k in value. Because its a joke.. it has no value. It actually just got memed up to 19k (I bought at 2k and sold at 17 just cause this shit is too easy) you cant be serious to think that bitcoin is going to make another come up after the whole crypto market has endured all those scams.. yikes.;0;0;False;TrumpIsMyDada;dtylkeg;Thanks to the recent dip and consistent dollar cost averaging over the past 7 months, I have finally reached my goal of owning one whole bitcoin.;7w06ui;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7w06ui/thanks_to_the_recent_dip_and_consistent_dollar/

So to avoid short term cap gains on each individual purchase and having to remember what price you buy them at, it seems easier to buy a ton in one go. The downside being a volatile price means you never know if you got in at a good value ;1;0;False;tabiotjui;dtyp0on;Thanks to the recent dip and consistent dollar cost averaging over the past 7 months, I have finally reached my goal of owning one whole bitcoin.;7w06ui;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7w06ui/thanks_to_the_recent_dip_and_consistent_dollar/

"I digress a bit, their not “20x” the hassle, but all these garbo atomizers everyones glorifying are not as great as their being made out to be.. Most will last a week at best, while the cotton degrades in a matter of days as does the flavor.. The only thing I enjoy is an RDA with any kind of flatwire coils (I use “catterpillar” coils) and it works great but is a pain to maintain as opposed to tearing some plastic and lighting up. Again, Im NOT justifying tobacco or saying the maintenence of an ecig isnt worth the obvious benefit. Im just arguing that

isnt a viable answer to tobacco products imho. Unless your a non smoker here to shame people who actually smoke.
