I purchased some Bitcoin almost 2 weeks ago and have yet to be able to access it. Keeps saying on hold even though it says transaction complete on my history. Try contacting them and nothing done about it.  Feels like they have stole my money. Worst company ever. Customer service sucks.;1;0;False;scooty1972;e1rl7ou;Thank you Coinbase!!

I met a guy who had 300BTC on silkroad so that he could buy weed and molly without having to see a dealer in person. He pulled it all out before it closed and had it in cold storage but he is a trust fund kid so he basically didn't care about its value. He said he's just gonna sit on it for another ten years and see what happens and maybe open a charity if it really blows up.;1;0;False;digiorno;e1sokhg;Sometime in the late 21st century;8vn0vi;https://i.redd.it/vy5f2boa5m711.jpg

Some people think there is a connection between the Number of the Beast in the Bible book of Revelations and the fact that Bitcoin is Digital and people have a number for their funds.
