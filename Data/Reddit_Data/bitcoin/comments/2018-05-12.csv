Tech is mostly men, so people expect men to be in tech.. Way to get your panties up in a bunch over facts. People are dying because they don't have clean water, the planet is dying because of pollution, animals are getting fked by plastic... And you spend all your energy getting mad that people assume things that are generally true. Just Fking get over it and move on, life is short,. Stop getting offended over everything. Just live your life. ;2;1;False;SirTinou;dyu7811;Farewell from the Pineapple Fund;8ieffr;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8ieffr/farewell_from_the_pineapple_fund/

"And yet here you are on the internet getting offended that I feel the need to stand up for myself in my daily life.

Again, the *reason* tech is mostly men is the insane amount of gatekeeping going on by people just like you to keep women down and out.

Just because there are worse things happening in the world does not mean I can't work on fixing things in my career path and daily life as well. 

But you're just assuming I'm using all my energy on this and you know what they say about assuming. It makes you an ass, my friend.";1;1;False;dreamendDischarger;dyu7yco;Farewell from the Pineapple Fund;8ieffr;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8ieffr/farewell_from_the_pineapple_fund/
"Life is about being happy. It doesnt make anyone happy to waste countless hours every day having to find out if someone isnt exactly like other people in general. People chose to assume and adjust if they are wrong, its much faster than having to please every goddamn 0,0001% special snowflake.


Also most people don't give a shit if you're a woman or a man, it's just confirmation bias on your part because the few times it happens, you get triggered out of your mind.

"You're a legend Pine! Seriously, hero of our time. I had hoped you would take an interest in [openlittermap.com](https://openlittermap.com) to complement the openstreetmap, green steps, wild me, and sustainable oceans alliance investments as you said yourself ""*$250k go to OpenStreetMap, because geographic data for our world should be freely available, without restrictions""*. OpenLitterMap extends this to blockchain, and is the first project applying proof\-of\-work principles to Citizen Science, rewarding users with Littercoin \(erc20\) for the production of open geospatial data on plastic pollution, which has been of urgent concern for decades. Sharing your support of open data, all OpenLitterMap data is free and open \- you don't even need an account \( [openlittermap.com/maps/UK/download](https://openlittermap.com/maps/UK/download) \), and 100&#37; of data has been manually verified which I will be using to train ML once I can figure that out...currently finishing up week 3 of Andrew Ng's coursera and developing mobile apps. I am a self taught developer developing this project independently without funding since I wrote the methodology for my masters dissertation, which is exactly how OpenStreetMap began. My first peer\-reviewed software publication will be released soon \(Lynch, S., \(2018\)., [OpenLitterMap.com](https://OpenLitterMap.com) \- Open Data on Plastic Pollution with Blockchain Rewards \(Littercoin\)., *Open Geospatial Data, Software, and Standards.* I know you don't think this is worthy of an investment, but I would have loved to have featured you prominently in the article as the first person to make a contribution of OpenLitterMap, which I hope will generate a lot of interest in the new ""GeoBlockchain"" rewards space I am trying to pioneer. Maybe now either the EU or the corporate world can be the ones to help. Please do keep an eye out for my paper and if you are interested check out my [instagram.com/OpenLitterMap](https://instagram.com/OpenLitterMap) and [twitter.com/OpenLitter](https://twitter.com/OpenLitter) . If you are ever in Ireland I'd love to buy you a few beers anyway. I am very excited to see how your investments unfold. Hopefully $5 crowdfunding contributions can keep OpenLitterMap alive for now. If anyone would like to be a mini\-pine please consider support OpenLitterMap bringing you Littercoin and open data on plastic pollution on a global scale. However I must be honest and say that if a bitcoin giveaway philanthropist is not interested in OpenLitterMap I am not really left with much hope but I will plough on because I think open data on plastic pollution  on plastic pollution is important and I wish Pine did and I hope others do.";1;0;False;littercoin;dyvkfdy;Farewell from the Pineapple Fund;8ieffr;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8ieffr/farewell_from_the_pineapple_fund/

PineappleFund guy or girl, thank you for the uncountable thousands of people that have benefited from your generosity.
