"I agree with you that many charities squander money or outright hoard it and that just reinforces the truth that blindly throwing money at a problem won't solve it.  On a similar vein, if one does donate to a charity then it's important to choose what you believe to be the best use of your money.  If someone simply donates blindly that indicates to me that charity to them is just a feel good gesture.

That being said, I firmly believe that we have a moral obligation to share our resources with those who are in need.  The fact that there will always be negative consequences to human actions does not negate the fact that we can greatly lessen the suffering of others at a negligible cost to ourselves.  $10 a month is probably trivial to most of the people reading this but that could easily make a life and death difference to someone who can be reached by a charity organization.  Whether that directly goes towards food and shelter or helps fund efforts to combat disease, an amount of money so trivial as to not even count as a sacrifice can literally save lives.  If you can save a life at no cost to your happiness or well being then I believe you have a moral obligation to do so.

Come to think of it, cryptocurrencies might be an effective way to ensure that charitable donations are actually used as they should be.  Being able to track the money through the blockchain would allow for the kind of transparency that charity organization should have.  (I know that there are charities that accept bitcoin but I haven't looked into any of them.)  The need for intermediaries could be greatly reduced, increasing the portion of donations that actually go towards the services vs the expenses of running the charity.  I think if people had greater confidence that the money they donate is used in the way that they want it to be used then many more people would donate.  Cryptocurrencies could make a huge difference in that regard and better enable human generosity.";45;1;False;content404;dwprr27;Investing Tips from a Pro;8982l3;https://i.redd.it/un9mdgl9dlp01.jpg

Or maybe it saves a kid from cancer and if you don't save the kid he dies and then his dad decides to kill themselves because everything in their life sucks, and they'd do it by jumping off a bridge and it would cause a traffic jam and you'd get stuck in a traffic jam and get annoyed. Then you get fired for being late and you lose $10,000 worth of income before you get a new job and you take a pay cut and your life sucks now.

"**Charitable gift annuity**

A charitable gift annuity is a gift vehicle that falls in the category of planned giving. It involves a contract between a donor and a charity, whereby the donor transfers cash or property to the charity in exchange for a partial tax deduction and a lifetime stream of annual income from the charity. When the donor dies, the charity keeps the gift.

The amount of the income stream is determined by many factors including the donor's age and the policy of the charity.

"But that's not how you do it, you can't do tax fraud with cash donations.

You spend $1 million building a home, then get your buddy to value the property at 5 million. Then you donate the home to the charity and put 5 million as a tax deduction. So instead of paying (50% of 5 mill) 2.5 million dollars in tax, it only costs you the 1million you used to build the house. The charity can't sell the property for 5 mill, they only get 1 mill for it. But they dont mind because it's still free money for them, so they wont run to the IRS about it.

You are happy because you save 1.5 mill in tax. Your buddy is happy because he gets a fee and maybe even a percentage of the sale as the real estate agent. The charity is happy because they get 1 mill from the sale. But the government and the rest of the public aren't happy because you just cheated them out of 2.5 million that probably should have gone towards things like schools and fixing roads.

">>My bet? An increasing percentage of that population will take it, year after year after year, costing more and more.

> Not necessarily a bad thing,

How is this ""not necessarily a bad thing"" when the primary selling point of this is ""it'll save money?"" The only way it isn't ""a bad thing"" is if the costs of free housing undershoot the historical costs of incarceration.  I don't think they will, in the long run.

>Government property is never going to satisfy all individual preferences to the same degree as private property, most people want more control over their living spaces than a basic standardised model.

Right, but it's got this key selling point: *It's free.*

>So it would be an increasing percentage, up to a certain point, at which time you would have met demand.

You're assuming that.  I'm not.  I don't think nearly as many people as you think would turn down free housing, especially over time, as social attitudes towards it change to become more positive, etc.  People *presently* feel at least SOME sense of shame for living off someone else's nickel, if they didn't they'd certainly be more willing to do it.

>Everyone to some extent receives benefit from government services in some ways, it's not intended to be a reciprocal system.

Yes, it is.  I can make peace with some social programs, if they're producing results.  They almost never do, and they almost always produce dependence, which never, ever goes away.  So, you can understand the reticence which I exhibit when it is suggested that the government should give out yet-another free thing.

It isn't supposed to be directly reciprocal, but barring any serious physical or mental maladies which prevent a person from being an additive member of society, most of the population isn't just going to be cool with their blood, sweat, and tears going to some otherwise perfectly able-bodied person.

To quote the late, great, Iron Lady: ""The problem with socialism is that you always run out of other people's money.""

>  I don't think biologists have ever recorded a scenario wherein animals, who come into a surplus of resources, don't then immediately consume those resources and then face famine and death.

Immediately consuming all surplus resources is obviously not what humans do. The average Chinese family saves 28% of their income, the average Indian family 32%. 500 million Indians eat a vegetarian diet. People voluntarily consume less in various ways.

I think you're trying to say that the housing supply to the population overall would be in surplus, which I don't think can really be compared to the behaviour of an individual having surplus resources, a single person can't overconsume one apartment. The amount of housing would not be in surplus, it would just be matched to demand, there would be no intention to create more than necessary.

> You give x million people an option to have free housing, and some of those people simply will avail themselves of that option.

Yes

> My bet? An increasing percentage of that population will take it, year after year after year, costing more and more.

Not necessarily a bad thing, and I'm certain there would be a limit to the percentage of the population that want to live in government funded accomodation for obvious reasons - many people already own homes, government homes usually have a stigma, relatively low quality, inability to customise, limited styles, limited locations, potentially undesireable neighbours, etc...

Government property is never going to satisfy all individual preferences to the same degree as private property, most people want more control over their living spaces than a basic standardised model.

So it would be an increasing percentage, up to a certain maximum point, at which time you would have met demand.

> Then you have a permanent class of people who get to live for free (supported by people who don't get to live for free - where is the fairness in this relationship)

Everyone to some extent receives benefit from government services in some ways, it's not intended to be a reciprocal system. I paid about $38000 in income taxation last year. I walk everywhere, I don't travel by road. I'm not currently receiving government funded education. I haven't been in hospital for 30 years. My work is funding all these things, I benefit indirectly from these things, and directly from other things, I don't personally directly need to derive $38k of benefit for the relationship to be fair.

"> If you theoretically gave the money directly to someone who is starving - would that not be morally superior?

Will you also give them food for the next time period when they are starving? 

If it was a natural disaster, perhaps some kind of one time scenario, then yes, absolutely, donate. 

But you make be making their situation worse with the donation otherwise. Food aid shuts down a countries agriculture, heightening dependence, empowering dictators, and ultimately starving more people than  before the food aid.

Those who are philanthropic often overlook the indignity of being given something for nothing; and it is bad for so many reasons while at the same time it causes dependence. Giving food is morally the same as the gift of a free shot of heroin from a drug dealer. (at least the drug dealer is self-aware)

There is a true test of when it is moral to donate: when you could reasonably expect the person to pay you back the full amount. At other times, its is jingoistic and patronizing at best, and horribly cruel at worst.

People need the dignity of supporting themselves, of standing on their own two feet and earning what they receive. When you take that away from them, it is harmful.

> they would be guaranteed to spend all that money, driving the economy

This is incorrect; not all spending is the same. Look at the broken window fallacy for an example of why.

Charity spending is not good for the economy in the way that food spending from earned income is. Food charity is a form of economic warfare. 

When you buy some product, any kind of valuable product that you see value in, you are driving the economy in a healthy sustainable fashion. When you give money to charity, you pervert and distort incentives, and ultimately harm the people you are trying to help.

To be clear: I am absolutely in favor of charity to help overcome exceptional temporary circumstances.

Conservation Easements.  Typical ratios I see are around 4-5 to 1, meaning you 'invest' 100k in Dec. and save your marginal rate on 400k-500k on April 15th.  Assume a 40% blended fed/state rate for a total tax savings of 160k on the low side.  60% return on your charitable deduction in about 4 months. We do a lot of these.

"Youd be upset to find out that a lot of charities actually dont do much for the future of humanity compared to how much they do for the presence of their big bank accounts 

And there comes the question what is the future of humanity ? ALS raised millions that helped thousands of people yet that same millions couldve helped millions of Africans from death (not just a disease , although a horrible one). 

We as humans are always trying to ‘save’ the world. The world’s falling apart & there will always be negative consequences to certain human/nature events that will continue on until the end of Earth. 

If you do donate I just hope you make sure that money is allocated correctly. May I insert a [recommendation](https://reg-charity.org) for a seriously well intentioned foundation started by poker players where the objective is to maximize lives saved vs dollar spent. Youd think all charities would optimize their allocation of funds like this but A LOT dont & even if they did in a lot of cases charities receive donations out of sympathy & although American lives w diseases are improved/cured, the impact could be much more substantial.

"It's in society's best interest NOT to give to charity. If you purchase stock from a company that money goes to a private business that uses the money to grow the economy by employing people and providing services to clients. You're giving the money to hardworking men & women who will improve upon it and provide a return.

Charities and government programs (Medicaid, Social Security, education loans, etc...) give money to unproductive people who spend it on food, medicine, etc... These people don't produce much. The private sector isn't perfectly efficient at allocating capital to where it will be used most productively, but it's miles ahead of private charities and government. It feels really good to give to charity, but you have to realize that you're hurting society as a whole when you do it.

Now, if my brother was in trouble and needed help I'd TOTALY give to him and help him get back on his feet. I'd just say to myself ""I'm hurting society a little bit to do this, as there is a more producive us of my time & money, but I don't care because he's my brother.""
