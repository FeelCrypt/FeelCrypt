"Not a techy, but am a financial service ops guy. It seems to me what blockchain proposes as a solution via, (money and contract) in one place should make resolution easier, more direct as long as the initial contract is set up correctly. Who, or what reddit would have details on this idea being true or false?

Back in 2011 I set up my eeepc to mine because I didn't really know what it was but I heard about it on 4chan and decided to give it a shot. I set it up in my bedroom and forgot about it for almost 2 weeks. When I finally checked it I had 50btc in my wallet. I foolishly thought that meant I was earning about 25btc or about $750 per week. But then 2 things happened. 1, the bubble popped and my 50btc was only worth about $100 and 2, ... nothing happened... then nothing continued to happen... then I actually read how it all worked and realized I must have been really lucky and at some point while I wasn't watching it I mined 1 block. So I went through MtGox and cashed out. ;211;8;False;Reverend_James;e6a55pb;When you finally mine 0,0003 Bitcoin after one month.;9h8lui;https://v.redd.it/8s55opst59n11
