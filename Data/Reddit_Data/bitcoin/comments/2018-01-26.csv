Hello u/PineappleFund, it's great to see that you have even increased your support to SENS Research Foundation and the related Methuselah Foundation.

Keep up the good work! Please consider donating even more to SENS / Methuselah as these donations hugely speed up the development towards a world where aging has been brought under medical control.

I think my most unique pole vaulting injury might also be the best metaphor for people who bought Bitcoin at 19K. I had what seemed like a good jump, but somehow managed to completely lose my forward momentum and just sort of balanced on the pole in midair. Not really wanting to deal with an approximately 8 foot drop from where my feet hung to the ground, I quickly slid down the pole and literally burned the grip tape onto my hands.

"My guess is a mix of charging transaction fees for the users with large amounts of money invested and just their inherent value in having a large userbase, which in theory could be sold to some shitcompany that could ruin it with transaction fees or just sell user data to advertisers.

A wallet. CoPay is a wallet, but there's a lot around. Electrum is pretty nice too. But the way Bitcoin (and most cryptocurrencies) work, is there's a private key for every public address. The public address is what you give to people, and they can send money to it, and it's what they see when you send money to them. The private key is what you keep secret, and it's what lets you send the transactions from your address. So basically the private key controls your money. Services like coinbase control that for you, but if they get hacked your money is gone, look up what happened with mt.gox. I know Coinbase has an advanced option where you can create a vault and you get the private keys, but I recommend just using your own wallet. ;2;0;False;;dt8whcz;Keeping Coinbase on their toes - Robinhood adds no-fee crypto trading!;7sx64q;https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/25/free-cryptocurrency-trading-app/?ncid=mobilerecirc_recent

[This guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7ojvca/i_am_the_guy_that_lost_25000_due_to_ledger_scam) bought a ledger that was part of a scam.

I can't find it anymore, but I read a guy's story who said he was one of those super careful people who had 3 servers in different locations storing his recovery seed (or password, or something), all automatically being backed up, and then one day he had some issue where he needed the seed/password. But when he went to retrieve it he found that when he had changed the seed a month ago or so, the backup had overwritten the new seed with the old one on all three servers, causing it to be lost forever.";0;0;False;LegitosaurusRex;dt9cx82;Keeping Coinbase on their toes - Robinhood adds no-fee crypto trading!;7sx64q;https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/25/free-cryptocurrency-trading-app/?ncid=mobilerecirc_recent

"**Cray-1**

The Cray-1 was a supercomputer designed, manufactured and marketed by Cray Research. Announced in 1975, the first Cray-1 system was installed at Los Alamos National Laboratory in 1976. Eventually, over 100 Cray-1's were sold, making it one of the most successful supercomputers in history. It is perhaps best known for its unique shape, a relatively small C-shaped cabinet with a ring of benches around the outside covering the power supplies.

"It gets harder and harder to get a high return the more money you have.

If I think a company is going to do well, I can just open up my online brokerage account and place a buy order for $10000 worth of a commonly traded stock (high liquidity) fairly easily.  While $10000 is a lot of money for an average Joe retail investor, it is nothing to a hedge fund or any other institution.

If a hedge fund manager thinks a company will be more valuable in the future, they might try and buy $50 million worth.  Even with a very liquid stock buying $50 million worth of shares isn't so simple.  

On top of all that, a buy order of $50 million will move the price of the stock all on its own!  It's publicly traded, everyone else can see the trades you are making.  Supply and demand very much applies, and once you put in that buy order, there is suddenly too little supply for too much demand and the price is driven up, all from one trade!  So you thought the price of a stock could raise 15%, but it's already risen 10% on the news that you want to buy a bunch, cutting into any returns you were seeking.  As a result of this, hedge funds and other big institutional investors pretty much have to buy any large position in chucks over time.  It works the other way around too, try dumping $50 million of stock at once and watch the price plummet.

So if one of my $10000 positions spikes 10%, I can just immediately sell for my 10% gain, the same is not true for a large investor.

There are other reasons too, like having to deal with your investors wanting to get their cash out and having to sell out of positions earlier than you wanted to.  Not to mention, if you are famous for making good trades, there will be crowds of people watching your every move trying to get in on what you're doing.";11;0;False;TheHast;dt8u896;Keeping Coinbase on their toes - Robinhood adds no-fee crypto trading!;7sx64q;https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/25/free-cryptocurrency-trading-app/?ncid=mobilerecirc_recent

"It's not that Coinbase is the worst things it's just that a lot of people are unhappy with the level of service they provide when things go wrong. They also charge a relatively hefty, although not unmanageable fee for buying/sending crypto. In my experience they have been okay, but I will absolutely be switching to Robinhood as they are a familiar service that has treated me better in the year I've used them, and all of my money will go towards coins and not fees.

If you're interested in Robinhood pm so I can give you a referral code, we both get a free stock between 5-200$ of value, which is why everyone is spamming the referral stuff lol.

"Except Coinbase actually buys and sells bitcoin that you can withdraw and use.

From the look of it, this Robinhood thing will just be selling tracking certificates, not actually bitcoins that you can hold.

This is absolutely horrible for bitcoin, if so, and essentially introduces the same bullshit that has held the gold market in control by big banks, because you can create fake/unbacked gold ETFs - and now the same thing is coming to Bitcoin.

Why the fuck is everyone cheering this? This is turning bitcoin into fiat money (you have to trust Robinhood that they are actually holding the bitcoins for you).

Coinbase is much much better, even with all their massive flaws.

"Someone is PANICKING! Bear with me on this.

A short while before it peaked, someone invested a HUGE amount of money on behalf of a backer. Before they knew it, the market turned and their investment was in negative equity.

They were brave and toughed it out but are running out of time. Pump the market until it is far enough above their needs then dump their coins.

How do you pump a market? Provide such a desirable product but to a limited market but promise a roll out. .

Investors will see an opportunity for the market to grow and start pumping again so might be tempted by a ""buy low, sell high"" opportunity. So it begins.

"The trick is, actually following through with that strategy requires doing the opposite of what emotion tells you. Market crashing? Shit, better sell = selling low. Market rising? Shit, better buy = buying high.

That's why hodling is so popular. It's a better strategy than resorting to emotion *as long as* you believe in the long-term outlook of bitcoin.

Some might say using RSI, MACD, and other indicators is even better... but I'm not sure. I made some good trades doing that, and some bad ones. Felt a hell of a lot like playing roulette to be honest. But maybe using the right tools means that instead of the house having a slight edge, the edge becomes yours.

">I could end up losing money just trying to transfer coins back to coinbase for a final sell trying to cash out. Not really something I want to do.

I know I'm in the wrong sub for this but hopefully you weren't transferring using BTC. ETH transfer fees are incredibly cheap compared to BTCs. However, transferring out is free (I think, regardless of which coin) if you use Coinbase's web program gdax.com. Where the coin matters is when you're moving from the 2nd exchange back to gdax, you'll most likely pay a fee

Buy on Coinbase>transfer to gdax(also free)>transfer to 2nd exchange>buy altcoins

When you're ready to cash out
Sell altcoins for ETH(or BTC/BCH/LTC) on 2nd exchange> withdrawal to gdax>gdax to Coinbase(free)>trade for FIAT and you're good to go

The only fee you should encounter is when you withdrawal *from* the secondary exchange to gdax.

Can't wait until I turn 18 and this comes to my state. Can't wait to start using crypto more often.

If it's anything like eTorro then you won't be able to withdraw. Only trade pairs using leverage options and then withdraw cash profits.

So what will Robinhood use as it's BTC price? Because it won't be an exchange like traditional exchanges where you can withdrawal and deposit coins. Will there even be a chance for arbitraging?

Coinbase once again disabled my account and ignored all my requests for help except the last one about closing it. That one I received a reply in less than 24 hours. Which proves they chose to intentionally ignore the others. Good riddens Coinbase.

You could be talking about Bitcoin...

Mining performs the task of securing the network so that nobody can alter it. Otherwise we would need a central party that has power over everyone(banks) that decide who can get in and who cant, who decides that 2billion people are not worthy of financial inclusion...
