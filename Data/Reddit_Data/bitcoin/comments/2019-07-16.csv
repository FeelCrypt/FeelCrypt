\-ICO that promised to be the next APPLE but is in fact a complete scam.

\-Fishing website and email that relentlessly try to get to your private keys.

\-Exchange that risk to exit scam with your money

\-Have you thought of a 3 of 5 keys scheme where no one can get to your and steel your BTC with a wrench?

"My income denomination is approximately split 50/50 between contract work and trading. For the former, it could be USD, EUR or HKD depending on client preferences. If it’s a different currency with low liquidity we just default to USD. I personally prefer HKD since it’s pegged to the greenback and liquidity is pretty low so my rates in HKD nets me an additional 1% - 2%. I’m pretty flexible on this matter as long I get paid in BTC. If a client prefers Ethereum, I’ll just point them to an exchange. 

When it’s time for living expenses, I’m fortunate to have a few OTC buyers ready to scoop up some BTC for market rates.

I have generally steered away from cards due to the fees and my skepticism towards banking overall. I’m pretty much 100% cash when I hold fiat. Anything that requires online payments can be bought in Bitcoin if you are determined!

">My income and expenses are 100% Bitcoin.

Nice, as are mine!

To be slightly more accurate though, my income is denominated in euro and paid in BTC.  My expenses are about 5% denominated in BTC, 94% denominated in euro, 1% denominated in other currencies such as USD.  They are all paid either in BTC or using an AUD denominated credit card which I then pay off using BTC (messy, but ultimately easiest since I can pay an AUD credit card using BTC through several different services that don't require me to convert anything to fiat first).

The upside is that I don't ever hold any fiat, even if income and most expenses are denominated in it.

"Not saying commit bank fraud, but couldn't you run a little side LLC that didn't require a physical  location? Like a web design or IT security consulting business. Then use that to open an account? Idk if you're in the states, but I have a crypto-related business (no fiat-crypto exchange related activity however, since that would require an NY bitlicence) and had no trouble getting a checking account and even a small line of credit. Technically my business is in the Information Technology category, since Cryptocurrency isn't an option on an LLC app.

Or just open a personal account and use it for making trades? Of course that could mettle up any tax benefits granted to the business.

I was going to do this, but I live in NYS and the way the laws are phrased here, even my CT registered LLC would need a bitlicense ($5k app fee; pay full time compliance officer; strict record keeping; random audits; KYC/AML taken to new extremes; long process; often rejected) to opperate, since I'm a resident of NY.

Any comment of mine that reads as if the exchange rate between fiat and bitcoin is anything more than a very loose indicator of adoption is poorly written from my side, since that's a position I hold very strongly when it comes to this topic.

You'll perhaps note that I even avoid words like ""price"", ""buy"", and ""sell"" unless I'm quoting or trying to view things from the perspective of my interlocutor.  I tend to stick to words like ""value"" and ""exchange"" instead.

Lumping those two things together as if they're somehow related is a clear indicator that you don't understand what Bitcoin is.  That's fine; there's nothing wrong with not knowing something, but it does indicate that you might want to look in to it further.

>None of us knows if Bitcoin will outlive the currency you consider ‘valueless’ and stating otherwise is not very sensible to me.

Philosophically, I can agree that none of us ***know*** that because aside from the fact that I exist, I can't claim actual knowledge of anything.

However I can say with a high degree of confidence that Bitcoin will outlive every fiat currency we have and increase in value accordingly.

"To all of you out there who say that nobody’s going to spend something that increases in value? Here’s proof you’re wrong. 

When people get free money from something, the first thing they do is go spend that free money. 

That’s why a deflationary currency can actually work as a currency. 

They may not spend it today, but if they start off with $100 today, and they have $120 in a month? Guess where the $20 is going? And then they’ll do it again when it becomes $120 again.

It’s a process that takes time, and value will increase over time with a deflationary currency. So people will be incentivized to buy that thing so they can have an increase in money later. 

They don’t get an increase in money so they can stare at it for the rest of their lives. They take that increase and they spend it. So in time, there’s a huge spending incentive with bitcoin.

You can buy nearly any denomination you like through services like LibertyX, so even if you can't afford a whole bitcoin, you can throw ten bucks at it and watch it grow...throw 15 at it and I would feel confident it would perform better than a $15/oz of silver over time...I sold much of my silver collection on ebay to buy BTC...huge premium on ebay for physical silver plus a much lower BTC price made that a very profitable trade.

Also, see her question: is she an early adopter if she's asking you about how to cash it.  The question implies she didn't gather any Bitcoin-related knowledge despite being given a Bitcoin.

"I know all of this! I simply mean ive yet to accumulate enough of the investment even for my satisfaction at this point. Im sorry for the lack of clarity.

Ive got a LOT of precious metals. And my bare minimum threshold of BTC. Anything i can afford right now needs to be added to the primary stack.

Plus frankly him being 13 and a hoodlum living with the parents he does theres no one BTC is safe with. I can trust their nice safe though for the PMs

Hopefully in 3-5 years my stack will have accumulated enough i can freely give it away if appropriateright when hes hitting an age i trust him to learn and handle it.

"No,  mixers do not offer much privacy anymore at all.   That’s a common misunderstanding people have.  Mixers are effectively useless since the advent of advanced blockchain analysis tools like chainalysis.  

The bitcoin blockchain ledger is fully public and with advanced analysis tools, they know if money was sent to you from a dark net market, and if you sent it to a mixer, and they can determine how many you sent through the mixer, and how many you receive back, regardless of if they come in different amounts at different times.  It is not hard for modern chainalysis to connect the dots on your entire bitcoin history, present and future.
If you want to mix your coin, skip the mixer, goto morphtoken.com and convert your coin to Monero (it’s cheaper than a mixer also). Once you convert to monero, transfer it to another Monero wallet to put distance between your coin and the morph token offramp..
Now you have a coin that’s private and anonymous and you can send it to an exchange like kraken to convert to usd, and nobody is able to determine when you got that coin, how much of it  you have, who you got it from, etc.
It’s like a cash transaction, nobody needs to know the details unless you decide to share it with them.";2;0;False;Zinclepto;etwlpgz;Gave my sister 1 BTC for Christmas in 2013. Got this text yesterday. Warms my heart, so happy for her.;cdkxbx;https://imgur.com/Srj9IBb
