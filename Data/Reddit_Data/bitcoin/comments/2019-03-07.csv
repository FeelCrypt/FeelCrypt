"Who is suggesting a bank (or any public business) shouldnâ€™t make decisions primarily on finance/money? Banks are not governmental organizations - they are business. Why would we apply different expectations (around operating for profit) than McDonalds?

At least both banks and McD are regulated (to some extent) by the government- although I think some of those regs were recently rolled back (prior to latest election)";0;1;False;velamint;ehydvf3;When you forget about money in a bank account and soon realise that cash you had in the bank was never yours to begin with...;avz79f;https://i.redd.it/vzg3cvsc1fj21.jpg
"Ok, so which is it? The banks don't contact you because they can't, or the banks don't contact you because it's unprofitable?

This is the point I was getting at.";1;1;False;j4x0l4n73rn;ehyg657;When you forget about money in a bank account and soon realise that cash you had in the bank was never yours to begin with...;avz79f;https://i.redd.it/vzg3cvsc1fj21.jpg
"I'm not *saying* they should make decisions off of kindness alone, all I'm *saying* is that it's wrong to attribute incompetence to banks as a reason they aren't helping you. They are very competent. They *could* help you if they wanted. But they don't because it isn't profitable.

Though it would be nice if we lived in a world without profit incentive, I don't think banks could even exist in that world.";0;0;False;j4x0l4n73rn;ehyf1rr;When you forget about money in a bank account and soon realise that cash you had in the bank was never yours to begin with...;avz79f;https://i.redd.it/vzg3cvsc1fj21.jpg
"In America we have these things called Social Security Numbers that the government made specifically so they can track and differentiate between people who have similar names or records.

If you are opening a bank account in the US, you are recquired to provide them with your SSN so that they have the capability to tell the difference between the owners of two accounts. This is simple stuff. Your SSN is tied to a good portion of your economic activity, making it easy for the government and for banks to be sure they've got the right person.

You are acting like we live in medieval times where banks have to send out a town crier to shout, ""John J. Smith owes 50 dubloons!""";1;1;False;j4x0l4n73rn;ehzwg4i;When you forget about money in a bank account and soon realise that cash you had in the bank was never yours to begin with...;avz79f;https://i.redd.it/vzg3cvsc1fj21.jpg
"While profit motive surely has something to do with it (doesn't it always?), as I said in three comments now, it has to do with the risk in either of the two situations. It's not even really that hard to understand the difference. 

**Scenario 1**: Bank has your money. Bank calls some other person who they think is you and tells that other person ""Hey, we have your money. Come verify some information with us and we'll give you your money"". 

**Scenario 2**: You owe the bank money. Bank calls some other person who they think is you and tells them ""Hey, you have a loan outstanding with us. Come pay up.""

Which of these two situations do you think the bank is going to get a very timely response of ""Uh, gee Mr. Banker, I think you got the wrong guy?"" 

Without thinking any further than *just* those two scenarios, I'm sure you can conjure up an idea of the kind of extra due diligence on the bank's part that one situation warrants over the other.

"Fair enough. I'm sure that banks and the government could do more to find owners of unclaimed funds. My point still stands, though, that OP probably still has means to recover his money, and that would absolutely not be the case in the ""decentralized"" world of crypto.";1;1;False;G_Porgie;ei0845l;When you forget about money in a bank account and soon realise that cash you had in the bank was never yours to begin with...;avz79f;https://i.redd.it/vzg3cvsc1fj21.jpg
