"See, the guy he was replying to meant ""nice-ass pizza"", where the word ass was modifying the adjective, making the pizza nicer than nice. But our friend the ass pizza jokester misinterpreted it as ""nice ass-pizza"", ie. a pizza that is both nice and made of ass at the same time. This is of course impossible. Nobody likes ass in their pizza.";3;1;False;dooglus;cfrglj1;We've gotta be able to laugh at ourselves;1z5ynn;http://explosm.net/db/files/Comics/Rob/givemeyourcash.png

"> Oh and because of you I just bought more BTC.. so better sell yours because tomorrow it will crash to zero.

Maybe... if the top story when I wake up is *NSA Makes it RAIN Bitcoins* or something...

Seriously though... I always remind people to do things deliberately...  Ease into the market and ease out.

And please don't sell your house for Bitcoin to invest or something...

Though if any of my friends had done that in April when I taught them all about Bitcoin at a little meet up I had, they'd all be doing quite well financially about now.

"While I knew MtGox wasn't allowing cash payouts, they did have trading tools I wanted to use.  I heard that Bitstamp was better and was working on getting authorized so I could convert all cash on MtGox to BTC and transfer it to Bitstamp to resume trading there - aaaaand that's when MtGox was shuttered.

I was just looking for a place to trade and try some trading experiments to see how they'd perform *in the wild*.  They were a partial success and I learned a lot from them.  I had really only been working on the project since mid-December.

So... essentially I was impatient to try out my ideas and MtGox was what I had set-up initially (because of brand awareness).

...and I learned that if I'm going to trade, it could be problematic to let surpluses not needed to conduct the trades sitting on someone else's server where they could be stolen or seized, or any number of bad things... though my own personal wallet is not impervious to those issues either.";1;0;False;Bleak_Morn;cfrlf0u;We've gotta be able to laugh at ourselves;1z5ynn;http://explosm.net/db/files/Comics/Rob/givemeyourcash.png
