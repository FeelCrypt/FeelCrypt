"Nope, not part of this sub. I come by when the price tanks just to watch you clowns rationalize and predict utter bullshit.

Keep making predictions based on nothing. When they're wrong, just make some more. You may as well be guessing lotto numbers.";1;1;False;Iratus_Lepus;f31uohi;Wheeeeee!;d8rttu;https://i.redd.it/5w6x2ywdclo31.jpg
"So you are part of a subreddit in something you have no interest in? You set a reminder for yourself, so you could come back 13 days later—to point out someone who made a flippant prediction was wrong. 

Carry on then. 

Here’s my next more macro prediction: we hover here for a little longer, going no lower (even in a complete flash crash) than 6.2k, and by the end of the year we are definitely above 10k, and by 2022, we have breached 80k, which is 10x current position. 

Set a alert. You can be my personal remind me bot for my predictions. Thanks for your service.";1;1;False;lemineftali;f31thi8;Wheeeeee!;d8rttu;https://i.redd.it/5w6x2ywdclo31.jpg
">>I come by when the price tanks...

How long have you been doing that? Surely by now you’ve noticed by now that every time it “tanks”, it’s a higher integer—that “fake money”, which I’ve been living off a while now in California.";1;1;False;lemineftali;f31y8lm;Wheeeeee!;d8rttu;https://i.redd.it/5w6x2ywdclo31.jpg

"Username checks out.

Let me guess, you lost a bunch of money following redditor’s advice on crypto. This isn’t a financial advice sub—it’s most people just posting their thoughts.";1;1;False;lemineftali;f31ioxz;Wheeeeee!;d8rttu;https://i.redd.it/5w6x2ywdclo31.jpg
Keep making up bullshit and posting it on the internet to pretend you know jackshit.;1;1;False;Iratus_Lepus;f31h5b8;Wheeeeee!;d8rttu;https://i.redd.it/5w6x2ywdclo31.jpg
I've never invested in fake money. Just laugh at the blind leading the blind.;1;1;False;Iratus_Lepus;f31nvye;Wheeeeee!;d8rttu;https://i.redd.it/5w6x2ywdclo31.jpg
