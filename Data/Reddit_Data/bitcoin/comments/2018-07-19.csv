I was painting the exterior of a home and I started to whistle while listening to music. The neighbor yells at me to stop It. I take my headphones off and ask her if she’s talking to me. She said, “ya! Do i make you nervous or something?” And I said excuse me? She said, “Apologize right now!” She was pointing and shaking her head from being so mad. “You say sorry for whistling!” I asked her, “you really want me to say sorry for whistling?” She didn’t say anything. Just looked at me like she was about to jump over the fence and rush me. I also couldn’t tell if she was “all there” so I thought for a second. I told her, “I’m not going to apologize for whistling, fuck off”;5;1;False;;e2neg3z;when a robber asks for your wallet...;8zvi36;https://i.redd.it/8vriowabhpa11.jpg
