I'm sorry that your parents dropped you on your head...


Alright, I admit it, I am wrong, gold isn't superior to BTC in every single way, but you know what is...?

USD.

I can buy things online with it, I get paid for my work in it, it's not that volatile and most importantly, it's actually relevant and everyone accepts it no matter what.

In case I lose my credit card, I can go to a bank and have it blocked, then buy a new one, which is pretty cheap, and it was my own fault anyway.

If I get scammed, I can ask my bank to chargeback.

BTC has blockchain though, and it's just so safe and secure, especially when you lose your digital keys to the wallet, or even better, your hard drive dies (keeping it in every hard drive is how you get it stolen with all your money that you cannot charge back).


BTC is all downsides, and it's detached from reality just as much as you are, and holds no actual value in the real world (again, just like you).


But do you know why I mention gold? Because that's what I'd invest into if I didn't want to keep it in form of USD, it's not volatile and I am pretty much guaranteed to get my money back when I need it, and when I do lose it, it won't be x10 times less.

There are plenty of good reasons to buy bitcoin. Billions of people don't have access to a bank account. Plenty of people want to send money abroad easily, cheaply and/or discreetly.

The money in my bank accounts is insured to a limit of 100,000€. That's way too low for plenty of people.

"Not true. Forex requires CGT beyond a certain threshold.

You can easily cash out Bitcoin with no tax if you cash out below the CGT threshold.

If anything that plays into the hands of BTC holders because it forces you to hold more for longer and to keep cash outs below CGT.

The threshold is £12k in the UK. Anything below that and you don't even need to declare it.

Source: https://www.gov.uk/capital-gains-tax/allowances

Cash out £12k then DCA 50% back in weekly. Wash rinse repeat until you reach enough that the 20% tax is meaningless.

You get a bonus £6k each year and you benefit from DCA...all on house money.
