Yes, see my other comments where I explain this.

Miners do the work under the premise that coins will be created at a predictable decreasing rate. Changing that on the fly will not happen.

No, like I said, it's not at all likely. The reason I point it out is because multiplying everyone's balance by 10 as well as the hardcap by 10 is, programmatically, the only way to add another decimal place. Since a satoshi cannot be made smaller, you must make Bitcoins smaller and give everyone more of them. Then a Satoshi becomes nine decimal places of a Bitcoin.";2;1;False;ianpaschal;dq1i2xn;This is why I want bitcoin to hit $10,000;7dpypn;https://i.redd.it/fhzsxgcv9nyz.jpg

 > If there is a need for them, additional decimal places can be added with concensus of the network. This is why some refer to ""infinite"" divisibility, because we can select the level that we need as time goes on.

> The current level selected in the code (by Satoshi) is 8 decimal places (1 satoshi = 0.00000001 BTC) hence the nickname for the smallest unit currently possible for bitcoin today.

Also a very old discussion about this: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=8657.0

So yes, you are correct in the sense that is the current set limit and current consensus, however that is not the ultimate limit of divisibility and more decimal points can be added if there is demand for it.

"Oh! I recall from some 6-7 years ago that it was spoken that it is essentially GUI limitation.

However, that does not limit subdivision if it is read as each byte representing a fraction, ie first decimal point is first byte, second decimal point is second byte etc. You simply add bytes to the end.

I am 100% certain that back then the talk was that BTC is in essence infinitely divisible, but for the moment limited as makes no sense to have more decimal points. This was back when 1BTC was worth like 0.05‚Ç¨.

By the time 1BTC is $1mil, I don't think we'll need to introduce a fork.  Partly because a penny is already worthless and will be worth even less by that time, and partly because of the above.

"> Then we agree. Although it's programatically the only way...on the main chain. LN and sidechains should be capable of handling more precise values. Already today some exchanges use additional decimal places and round up when they settle on the main chain.

Yup, true, but as for the original statement that this could simply be changed with a soft fork is completely wrong. Also that a satoshi is merely a cosmetic division of a Bitcoin unit. (Side note: are these the same people who have been vehemently fighting a holy war over other Bitcoin technical issues? Yikes.)

Not sure I understand your second statement though: By the time 1 BTC is $1m, then satoshis will absolutely start to matter. Pennies get more and more worthless because of inflation but Bitcoin is insanely deflationary meanings pennies/satoshis are *the* future of Bitcoin.

> Even if a hard fork is needed, that isn't the kind of thing that's likely to cause contention. It's been talked about before. It's doable. If it's becoming necessary everyone will likely be on board.

I'm willing to bet you it absolutely would cause contention. Especially because people are so attached to the idea of hard caps and clearly don't understand anything about what value a bitcoin or satoshi actually is storing.

My argument isn't that these systems are a net good or would exist in a perfect world, but that these are examples of places you can put money to have a ROI while that money has an economically productive effect, while money in Bitcoin is not being economically productive and that a widely-used deflationary currency will reduce available capital, slowing the economy.

As counter-arguments:

* Being willing to buy stocks on the secondary market keeps their value up, allowing people who bought them from the company to know their purchases will be worth it.
* There are problems with debt, but the money is still going to use.
* But the loan is allowing a person who otherwise couldn't to buy a house / make capital purchases for a business / make payroll to do that, so it is causing economic activity.";1;0;False;CountOneInterrupt;dq2a2ah;Yeah! Bitcoin!;7dxlap;https://imgur.com/RRU8NXK

"> In macroeconomy ...

You're essentially changing the subject now. Here are the comments that started this discussion:

> If he buys her a drink for 10 bucks that'll be like $10,000 in a few years. Forget it she can just go thirsty

> > Please don't think like that.  
> > If nobody spends their BTC, there is no real use for bitcoin. Bitcoin will be collapsed. Economic.

My point is that the first commenter's position is rational. If one has a choice of spending a deflationary currency vs. a neutral or inflationary one, the only rational choice is to spend the latter. As such, the entreaty ""please don't think like that"" is useless, arguing against not just *a* rational position, but the *only* rational position under the circumstances.

I further stated that this characteristic is a problem for a supposed currency. You're essentially making arguments in mitigation of that problem, you're not saying anything that contradicts its existence. 

But even those arguments are, like the person saying ""Please don't think like that"", simply arguing with reality. The reality is that most people will, quite rationally, avoid spending a deflationary currency, and tend to use alternatives instead. Because of this, your macroeconomic speculation about what a system might look like with only a deflationary currency is nothing more than a fantasy. It's not going to happen in the real world.

> There is no need to make a distinction between asset classes, it's just a way to make language easier.

Sorry, but this is complete nonsense. Different asset classes have significantly different properties, and there's a cost associated with switching between classes. That cost is significant here - if switching between asset classes were free, then the optimal choices would be different.

> Bonds can be bought and sold quickly too, just about as fast as moving money from a normal account to an account connected to a payment card.

""Can be"", yes. But *should* they be? The same logic applies here: it doesn't make sense to sell appreciating bonds to pay for something if you have some other way to pay for it. There's also a cost associated with selling bonds, which you don't want to have to pay every time you need to spend money.

That's why rational economic actors keep some proportion of assets in different classes, and part of why the asset class distinction is economically relevant, and not ""just a way to make language easier.""

> With deflation people save in currency, that's the only difference

No, it's not the only difference. Another difference is that people are less inclined to spend. And that's a problem for a currency, in the sense that it will inhibit the use of the currency, and cause people to use alternatives.

"**Gresham's law**

In economics, Gresham's law is a monetary principle stating that ""bad money drives out good"". For example, if there are two forms of commodity money in circulation, which are accepted by law as having similar face value, the more valuable commodity will disappear from circulation.

The law was named in 1860 by Henry Dunning Macleod, after Sir Thomas Gresham (1519‚Äì1579), who was an English financier during the Tudor dynasty. However, there are numerous predecessors.

You seem to be missing some distinctions here. Different asset classes have different purposes. No-one's claiming that appreciating assets are a problem in general.

The desire to avoid spending it is a problem for something that's intended to be a currency.

Again, currencies don't try to be anything. There is however government policy to inflate the currency, which basically just means to increase the amount of money. 

Which shouldn't be surprising. The temptation of printing money is always there. People with control over the production of money have always used every excuse at hand to allow themselves to create more of it. 

It's just taxation without all the hassle. 

Again, you are talking about an unexpected deflation swing. An unexpected inflation swing is also damaging.

not true? 

if I lend you 100$ with 2% deflation and 2% interest rate then the effective cost of that loan is 4%. 

If i lend you 100$ with 2% inflation and 2% interest rate then the effective cost of that loan is 0%. 

if I lend you 100$ with 2% deflation and 0% interest rate then the effective cost of that loan is 2%. 

If i lend you 100$ with 2% inflation and 1% interest rate then the effective cost of that loan is -1%. 

i  cant lend you 100$ with 2% deflation and -2% interest rate, no one ever would lend someone 100$ just to get 98$ back when risking nothing would give you 100$. There is no such thing as a (nominal) negative interest rates in this case.

the deflation rate has to be added in addition to the interest rate someone is willing to risk their money.

"I agree with your saying that deflation is bad for the economy, absolutely. It's much harder to get rid of deflation than inflation. The issue I have with your comment is you saying deflation is a capitalist heaven, which is absolutely not true. Capitalist heaven would be enormous consumption.
A country that is in deflation has serious problems because people don't consume as much as before. Their money will be worth more tomorrow, why spend it today? Now if the aggregate demand for all goods fall because people don't wish to consume that much and rather save their money, then companies are forced to lower their prices to get people buying products. This is super risky and some large companies might shut their business down if the prices drop too much and they cannot make economical profits. So do you really think that a situation as such is a capitalist dream?

Japan is an ideal example of what happens when deflation is out of control. They have been battling deflation for 2 decades if I remember correctly. Deflation leads to less consumption, less consumption leads to less production and that leads to lower economic growth.

"Bitcoin is just the gateway drug. Once you have some, you can trade it for Doge and other coins. 

The cost for this exchange is typically 0.1% so on $10 for example you would pay 10 cents just to flip the Bitcoin into a faster, cheaper coin. Then it costs 1 Doge to spend Dogecoin - which is 0.001368 cents. So about every 7 purchases combined would rack up about 1 cent in tx fees.

Total cost: 11 cents to pull out $10 and spend parts of it up to 7 times. 

Now if you went to an ATM. . . 
- Can you even withdraw $10?
- Was it your banks ATM or did you get stuck with that $2-$3 dollar withdraw fee?
- Now that you've taken the money out, can you put back and protect what you haven't spent?

- Prone to card skimming
- Using the banks money (which can be seized / frozen on you against your will)

"**The Great Deflation**

The Great Deflation or the Great Sag refers to the period from 1870 until 1890 in which the world prices of goods, materials and labor decreased, although at a low rate of less than 2% annually. This is one of the few sustained periods of deflationary growth in the history of the United States. This had a negative effect on businesses in established industrial economies such as that of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland while simultaneously allowing strong growth in the United States which was just beginning to industrialize. See: Long depression

There were several so called depressions during the period that were actually profit recessions.

***

**Long Depression**

The Long Depression was a worldwide price and economic recession, beginning in 1873 and running either through the spring of 1879, or 1896, depending on the metrics used. It was the most severe in Europe and the United States, which had been experiencing strong economic growth fueled by the Second Industrial Revolution in the decade following the American Civil War. The episode was labeled the ""Great Depression"" at the time, and it held that designation until the Great Depression of the 1930s. Though a period of general deflation and a general contraction, it did not have the severe economic retrogression of the Great Depression.

Why might you want to hold Bitcoin as opposed to some obscure altcoin? The reason boils down to the demand for Bitcoin being driven by actual use. 

Just holding doesn't count as a use. Holding alone relies on circular logic: ""Bitcoin is valuable because lots of people are holding it, and lots of people are holding it because it's valuable."" This is virtually the definition of a bubble, easily popped by a fad or a scare.

By contrast, if it's actually used as a medium of exchange, that creates a ""natural"" demand for it that won't easily go away, because that use requires systems, and systems are costly to change. 

But if people stop using Bitcoin, the systems in place to handle it will start to be abandoned. Demand for Bitcoin will drop, and more importantly, perception of the value and future stability of Bitcoin will drop, and the price will tend towards zero.

"Bro, I can't dump my Tesla stock. Do you have any idea how much its going to be worth in 5 years?

In all seriousness, if you are trading labor or fiat for bitcoin, and you appreciate gains between the conversion and that moment, thats *free money*. You should be even more encouraged to spend your free money.

I don't really get the whole ""deflationary currencies will send the economy into a death spiral"" fallacy.

When you need a new computer, do you wait 6-12 months for the latest tech, or do you buy it now? You buy it *when you need it* the same way you will *spend your bitcoin when you need to*.

And if not spending it encourages fiscal responsibility? Good. We need that.

Theres a false dichotomy of assuming that everyone will just hold their bitcoin. The problem we have today is that people are fucking debt slaves and spend more money then they have. Encouraging a small percentage of the population to *actually be fiscally responsible* would probably have a net beneficial effect upon society. Lets be honest - The habits of over spending is entrenched upon society. Good fucking luck changing that from a macro perspective, and having that effect change the *majority* of the populations spending habits.

Its not going to cause a collapse because 2% of the economy decided to not buy bitches some drinks at the bar because they don't want to spend their crypto.

But that 2% ? They are going to buy *a fucking house* or *start a goddamn business* with that capital that they accrued from their fiscal responsibility.

The assumption that everyone is just going to hoard their digital gold forever is absurd. This is such a scare tactic by old school economists and statists. They **want** you to be debt slaves forever, stuck in a closed loop society of nothing but debt and slavery.

How about you break free from that vicious cycle, start actually practicing fiscal responsibility, and then contribute back to society in a meaningful way once you've reached your goals?

This is one of the many reasons bitcoin is good for society. It encourages people to be fiscally responsible, to break away from the vicious debt slavery cycle and has the added benefit of being *good money* that allows you to exit from centrally controlled *bad money* that is incumbent upon all.

"I am printing a sign [that will look like this](https://i.imgur.com/G84W0Cf.jpg). I got the '17 price quoted as $5,000...

JUST [5 months ago](https://imgur.com/a/C6pAn), immediately after tax season I printed these signs. That's when I started the club. I wanted to print a 'solid' price for Eth & BTC so I choose the week before, when ETH was $180 and BTC had a market cap of $35 Bil. I was like 'surely these numbers will not go down'.

Many Bitcoin Groups have existed, but not so many so public, as far as I know. I have plans to run for Mayor of Knox County, against the famed wrestler Kane. If my area can begin large meetings filling lecture halls, like [these guys have been doing](https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7dsjla/had_a_very_successful_night_last_night_organizing/?utm_content=comments&utm_medium=user&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=frontpage), that would be amazing, and help toward my campaign.

However, considering it is a long shot, I decided to take Daniel Krawisz advice and declare myself Mayor Of Bitcoin. If I had to choose between being the Mayor of Knox County, or the Mayor of Bitcoin, I would rather be the Mayor of Bitcoin. Not only are my people expected to become richer than the surrounding communities, but they are also technically, financially, and globally inclined.

However, in the long shot that I win against Glenn Jacobs, I could combine the Mayor of Bitcoin and Knox County position into one. Though it would pose a conflict of interest, I think the merger could benefit both peoples.

In either case... it's going. And the next step is $5,000 in flyers (those have yet to be designed) to be mailed out to 15,000 people using USPS Every Door Direct, discussing Bitcoin, Taxes, Discovery, and Governance.

This should be a big year for my little shop, and it has been a big year for Bitcoin. I may have to up the '17 price from 5,000 to even be reasonable lol :)";-11;3;False;kybarnet;dq2br3s;1BTC = 8000USD on GDAX;7e27m2;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7e27m2/1btc_8000usd_on_gdax/

BTC is obviously the frontrunner so it seems to make sense to buy some, but it's unlikely getting in now will result in the kind of returns people who got in early saw. So it seems like many are hoping to find the ""next"" bitcoin by investing in newer alts -- a lot of it seems like wishful thinking powered by the remorse of not having gotten into bitcoin early.

Lots of websites will be talking about BTC reaching 8,000 and an ATH tomorrow, this will cause more people who were previously on the fence to buy BTC and will drive up the price in the coming days. Also banks don't process transfer on the weekends so shortly after the weekend is often an additional bump. There is still a chance for a small dip as people set beforehand but no real reasons for BTC to drop. Also people will be more confident in BTC as it always seems to recover from dips and make its' way back up, this will attract serious investors.;7;1;False;aceismyfriend;dq23e30;1BTC = 8000USD on GDAX;7e27m2;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7e27m2/1btc_8000usd_on_gdax/
