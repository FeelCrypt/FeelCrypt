"Yes, it VERY much does.

Letâ€™s say I want to buy product X. Itâ€™s listed online for 100 dollars or .00045 (or whatever) Bitcoin.

If I spend my bitcoin I purchase at 16,000 on it, Iâ€™m effectively spending 300 dollars on that item which is absolutely irresponsible.

For another way to think about it, letâ€™s use gold. Letâ€™s say a year ago you bought a bunch of gold bars for $16,000 each. Since then the price of gold has plummeted and now each bar is only worth $6000. You tell yourself it doesnâ€™t matter since you still have gold right?

Now you go to the pawn shop and want to buy some stuff and they will accept gold at the current market price. You see an item you like and it cost $16,000 dollars. Great, just give him a single gold bar and youâ€™re done right?

Wrong. Since gold is worth a third of what it was when you bought it, you need to use **3** gold bars now to make that purchase. Effectively you just paid $48,000 dollars for a $16,000 dollar item. 

So if you spend bitcoin today and you bought when I did, youâ€™re paying 3 times more than you would if you bought something with cash. Itâ€™s just foolish.

Letâ€™s say I do it your way. Thereâ€™s an item for sale online for $100 and the seller also accepts BTC (and like 99.99% of vendors; they value it in relation to the USD.) 

So I could buy it in BTC and then go to Coinbase and buy another 100 dollars worth of bitcoin and be right back where I was right?

Wrong. Because now Iâ€™m effectively paying 104 dollars for that item with exchange fees AND I just made life more complicated for myself.

"OK, I'll use my head, thanks for the tip.  

Now perhaps you could do the same?  you literally said, it's not about the money, then said, you are sad about the money.  One of us is making statements that are contradictory, can you guess which? (pro tip-use your head).  

You can say you care about the tech, and the profit, and that is fine.  But if you say you do not care about the profit, and only the tech, what is the problem, it will moon soon. 

You are literally saying that you believe in it as a currency,and if you were to use it as such, you would be screwed.  That would seem to make the point that the tech is not working as intended.

So that is a fair point, but not if you are a tech ""believer.""  So which is it?  you want the tech to work, AND you want the money part to work.  Both have failed, yet you say ""we honestly want to use crypto as currency. We believe in it long term and want to be a part of it.""  If that is actually true, then sit on your stacks and quit complaining about price. 

So you want to cherry pick your outcome with an entirely new technology and claim not to care about the money, except you do care about the money.  How did I do?  (I used my head).
