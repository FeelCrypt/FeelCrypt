"Sure, currencies don't stay static, *against other currencies*.

But in a world where **bitcoin** is our currency then we pay for everything in btc. There's no converting it, there's no comparing it to other currency to determine the price of milk. 1btc = 1btc.

If it cost the milk producer 1btc to produce 1l of milk, and they sell it to the stores in bulk for 1.5btc, and the stores sell it for 2btc... then why would the price be fluctuating at all?

Remember, this is in **a world** where **bitcoin is our currency**. There's no conversion. 

In our current situation, where bitcoin is **not** our currency, we have to convert to USD or GBP or whatever to purchase the milk. That is completely different.";1;1;False;Allways_Wrong;djjimgc;When I invested in BTC and it isn't giving me my expected 34524% returns;6jsaq4;https://i.redd.it/6hsumcajk66z.jpg
"Have you ever looked at what happens in places that have explosive inflation or deflation? Because it doesn't work at all like you seem to think it will.

When people lose trust in a currency they'll find another way to exchange value. Your fantasy world where bitcoin is the only currency will literally last as long as it takes for someone to start using bottlecaps or baby kitten skulls or gold as a shadow currency.

And at that point, you have a currency nobody trusts AND nobody has any way to use monetary policy to fix that.";1;1;False;Zaeron;djk2vhe;When I invested in BTC and it isn't giving me my expected 34524% returns;6jsaq4;https://i.redd.it/6hsumcajk66z.jpg

I don't follow. How does printing money maintain it?;1;0;False;urbutt_;djkok4c;When I invested in BTC and it isn't giving me my expected 34524% returns;6jsaq4;https://i.redd.it/6hsumcajk66z.jpg
That is true. But right now the percentage of the population that uses bitcoin is minuscule. Something like 10 million? If  even 50 million  of the 3 billion people use this technology the market cap will grow and the fact that this is global will allow the growth to happen quicker. ;1;1;False;Jsweezy1212;djjg8vc;When I invested in BTC and it isn't giving me my expected 34524% returns;6jsaq4;https://i.redd.it/6hsumcajk66z.jpg
It's a simple, polite question. ;1;0;False;Allways_Wrong;djjidko;When I invested in BTC and it isn't giving me my expected 34524% returns;6jsaq4;https://i.redd.it/6hsumcajk66z.jpg
Yes except it can't be maintained by printing more money. It has to be mined, which follows a curve similar to gold. There is a limit.;1;1;False;darkfaith93;djjvekp;When I invested in BTC and it isn't giving me my expected 34524% returns;6jsaq4;https://i.redd.it/6hsumcajk66z.jpg
Yes, but if someone said that at $2 reaching 1,000x to hit $2k, they had validity because of how tiny of the global fair market they need to account for. Now to go from 2,500 to $100k or even to $50k, you need a substantial piece of the global market exchange as opposed to the raindrop $2k a coin is. ;2;1;False;PhillyCrypto;djjfibk;When I invested in BTC and it isn't giving me my expected 34524% returns;6jsaq4;https://i.redd.it/6hsumcajk66z.jpg
"> It's backed by what people say it's worth. It has purchasing power and as long as people accept it, people will use it as a currency. 

So fiat money is precisely like bitcoin in this sense? Who would have thought.";1;1;False;urbutt_;djjuson;When I invested in BTC and it isn't giving me my expected 34524% returns;6jsaq4;https://i.redd.it/6hsumcajk66z.jpg
The thing is, you cant rule it out. Literally, nothing with this is impossible because of how unknown it all really is. I tend to agree and think the 100k predictions  are somewhat wishful thinking, but the same can be said when BTC was $2 a coin and now its over 2K. The unpredictability of it makes it both risky and enticing. ;1;1;False;Jsweezy1212;djjb5xl;When I invested in BTC and it isn't giving me my expected 34524% returns;6jsaq4;https://i.redd.it/6hsumcajk66z.jpg
