No, because the signing device never connects to a network.  You physically copy an unsigned transaction as a text file from the network connected computer, to the air-gapped one, open electrum that has your passwords, sign the transaction, copy the signed version to a usb, go back to the network one, load electrum, and broadcast it from there.  A hardware wallet is still connecting to your network connected computer.  It could be doing anything. ;1;1;False;Frogolocalypse;ed9nprj;Judge bitcoin by yearly lows, not all time highs.;abznev;https://i.redd.it/3n7l1vlmp3821.jpg
"A trezor also never connects to a network. The exact same process happens when using a trezor. An unsigned transaction is sent to the trezor, the trezor sends the transaction back signed, electrum allows you to evaluate the signed transaction to your heart's content (verifying that it does what you want it to do), and then you broadcast it. 

> A hardware wallet is still connecting to your network connected computer. It could be doing anything.

Even on windows computers newer than 2007, this isn't true. A USB device can't simply execute anything it wants to on your computer. Something has to be using it. So no, it couldn't be doing ""anything"". 

The only loophole I can see is if your main computer *and* your trezor was infected with malware that knew about each other.

"> The assets could be moved into an account that no one has access to (including the third party)

What? What account? Who's storing the assets in that account? Can we please make this concrete? It certainly doesn't sound like you're talking about gold, which would have to be stored and guarded by a 3rd party (if you think that a 3rd party need not be involved). However, even if you're talking about completely information assets, like ownership of stock, this requires trusting that the relevant government jurisdiction will fairly judge your legal case if the company decides to reneg on its stock. This is trust in a 3rd party. This is fundamental to a backed asset.

> Smart contracts can be written upon acquisition of stablecoin to approve a transaction from that account in event A or event B.

The smart contract doesn't matter if you're denied the asset backing when you ask for it.

That's a pretty rude way to put it. I don't appreciate that. Of course there's tons of shit about USB I don't understand. But telling me I ""don't know how USB works"" is insulting and not accurate. Your information is interesting, but your tone really makes me want to say ""fuck you"". 

In any case, when you ""copy the signed version to a usb"", you're putting your trust in the manufacturer of that USB stick. So the security is of the same order of magnitude as a hardware wallet.

"Apologies accepted. I definitely can see targeting hardware wallets to be more likely to be targetted for bitcoins specifically, but from the perspective of the state, it would make the most sense to only put effort into compromising the most popular devices they can get away with. For example, if the govt was able to compromise Intel's hardware manufacturing process (via bribery, threats, or covert design injection), your air gapped computer could transmit anything it wants via the usb drive (according to the article you sent me). This would be far more effective than trying to compromise trezor or even large companies like Kingston that make usb drives. They could monitor or steal a whole array of things, including bitcoin on air gapped computers (tho not ones on genuinely produced hardware wallets).

So if the target is only Bitcoin, i think you're right that trezor puts a larger target on you. But if the target is anything and everything someone might want to steal, something with a larger customer base would be much more likely to have this problem. In fact, for your process you need to trust both your pc hardware manufacture(s) (including chip designer, motherboard manufacturer, usb port manufacturer, etc) and the usb drive itself. Plus, you can never use that usb drive for this purpose ever again, or you also have to trust that your non air gapped computer hasn't been compromised (defeating the purpose of the air gap). Is it really feasible to buy a new  usb drive anytime you want to withdraw from your cold storage? With trezor, it's a much simpler device with fewer parts and therefore far fewer manufacturers and entities you need to trust.

I guess it all comes down to who you trust for your hardware. Until we can print our own hardware, this will have to be the case.";2;0;False;fresheneesz;edbcyu7;Judge bitcoin by yearly lows, not all time highs.;abznev;https://i.redd.it/3n7l1vlmp3821.jpg

"It probably isn't. But you don't know.

But as to the subject at hand.  By choosing generic devices that never had a specific purpose, and never get used again for another purpose after their usage, you can reasonably be sure that their security isn't breached.  In the case of a device that is specifically designed for managing keys, and signing bitcoin transactions, by compromising the production of that device, or even the firmware upgrade of that device, you are far more likely to be directly targeted.

I'm thinking of it in the ways that i would attack it from the perspective of the state.  I actually expect that this will eventually happen, although years and maybe even decades in the future.  I simply don't trust devices for the reasons I've stated.

"And your scenario 100% eliminates human nature and speculative markets, even as a thought experiment it is totally dumb, but I gave you benefit of the doubt there.. 

It 100% will lead to fewer buyers as the price goes up, due to speculation on what bitcoin is actually worth (you know, the whole reason we went from 3k to 20k and back down to 3k within a year and a half).

My point is that no sellers doesn't *have* to result in prices rising, if buyers become uninterested passed a certain price, then price simply won't move and volume will drop off a cliff. I also acknowledged this isn't gonna happen with bitcoin at this time, that it would go up. But you seem to think it'll skyrocket ""soar"" to, presumably, much higher than 20k? How high exactly is ""soaring""? When I read that I was thinking 50 to 100k? I'm saying that's not necessarily true, at some point buyers will say no way, not without consolidation, and speculators and shorts also would pile in to the sell side. Though I'm sure your imagined scenario also presumes shorts wouldn't exist... Somehow.. 

With other assets too though, you have to understand that demand isn't always existent beyond a certain price. Just because no one is willing to sell, doesn't mean higher prices must follow. It could mean volume drops off a cliff and no price change occurs at all, with a massive gulf between bids and asks.

"That's a silly fact though. Sure both are 5x your investment... but what actually matters is how much you bought.

He spent like $100 and sold for roughly $500... making a whopping $400 profit.

Buying even 1 coin at $4k and selling at $20k is a $16,000 profit. Just a slight bit of difference there.

It boggles my mind that people don't realize going from 6 cents to 30 cents is not a huge leap compared to going from $4000 to $20000. It's about scale, not just ""it's the same because it's multiplied the same amount!""

There's a reason TRX is trading at like fractions of a cent difference... because it's worth a whole $0.02 so if it were to suddenly go up to 10 cents someone could have been a millionaire if they bought enough of it at 0.02

"I'm theory a market can go from $1 to $20k on very, very little $ volume if there is suddenly a massive increase in demand, and barely anyone selling. Can't really measure conclusively how much money would be necessary to move an asset to a certain price due to market dynamics. If there's suddenly no sellers, and lots of buyers willing to pay a lot more, prices can move incredibly quickly on very little $ volume

I mean this rarely happens, something fundamentally needs to change. Think blow out earnings reports, or when a pharmaceutical drug gets approved or maybe is unexpectedly found to cure cancer or something. Those stocks can shoot up 10s or 100s of % on basically no $ volume, simply thanks to sellers not being willing to sell below a certain price, and buyers being willing to buy up to that price.

"Bought at $10k, now my Bitcoins are effectively unspendable for about 3 - 5 years. If Bitcoin is $2500 next month, then paying a $100 item with my Bitcoins would actually mean I'll be paying $400 for the same item. Crazy, right?

Someone said stablecoins are the future, I could agree to a point. Bitcoin is nothing more than gold or platinum. It's an asset that's easy to transport and keep, but is extremely vulnerable to nuclear war and Internet disruption. Only stablecoins tethered to ""stable"" currencies such as USD or EUR can be actually used as _currency_. Saying otherwise is just closing your eyes to truth.

And that's why we have bubbles in crypto. For every ATH there's army of people who devoted their existence in getting their revenge for buying at previous ATH. Guys who bought BTC at $1500 in 2014 are the same ones who dumped it in January and February 2018. As more and more people get burned, you have less and less new ones interested in it. And slowly it all goes downhill.

You could say, with usage, Bitcoin's price would stabilize. I'd say no. It will forever stay a speculative asset, reaching a plateau at about $100k - $150k somewhere around 2025 - 2030, then it'll be forgotten as new technologies replace it. 

You could say, but USD lost 99.9% of it's value since 1910. That's true, but it took USD about 100 years to accomplish that. It took Bitcoin **bloody 8 months** to lose 85% of it's value and no signs of recovery yet. How's that for a currency? Far worse than Turkish Lira.

You _need_ institutions, central banks, _big guns_ if you will, to provide stability to an asset and make it a currency. Behind United States Dollar there's a country with a 240+ years old constitution (regardless of who's running the FED). Behind Bitcoin there's only whales, speculators, scammers, Lambo idiots, and people bitching because they bought it too late.";20;7;False;rattie_ok;edagpt5;Whenever you doubt yourself, remember this guy.;ackua3;https://i.redd.it/hs9p8g3b6g821.jpg
