"Assuming there are (very) roughly 800 words in this image...

Assuming there is a 12-word-mnemonic hidden inside...

What's the chance you could randomly pick out the *correct* sequence of 12 words?

Each time you pick out a word, it gets removed from the set, so, the chance to correctly pick the 12 words in order would be (I think) equivalent to:

> (800 * 799 * 798 * 797 * 796 * 795 * 794 * 793 * 792 * 791 * 790 * 789) to one

" We consider the scenario of an attacker trying to generate an alternate chain faster than the honest chain. Even if this is accomplished, it does not throw the system open to arbitrary changes, such as creating value out of thin air or taking money that never belonged to the attacker. Nodes are not going to accept an invalid transaction as payment, and honest nodes will never accept a block containing them. An attacker can only try to change one of his own transactions to take back money he recently spent. The race between the honest chain and an attacker chain can be characterized as a Binomial Random Walk. The success event is the honest chain being extended by one block, increasing its lead by \+1, and the failure event is the attacker's chain being extended by one block, reducing the gap by \-1. The probability of an attacker catching up from a given deficit is analogous to a Gambler's Ruin problem. Suppose a gambler with unlimited credit starts at a deficit and plays potentially an infinite number of trials to try to reach breakeven. We can calculate the probability he ever reaches breakeven, or that an attacker ever catches up with the honest chain, as follows \[8\]: p = probability an honest node finds the next block q = probability the attacker finds the next block qz = probability the attacker will ever catch up from z blocks behind qz={ 1 if p≤q q/ p z if pq} 6 Identities Transactions Trusted Third Party Counterparty Public Identities Transactions Public New Privacy Model Traditional Privacy Model Given our assumption that p \> q, the probability drops exponentially as the number of blocks the attacker has to catch up with increases. With the odds against him, if he doesn't make a lucky lunge forward early on, his chances become vanishingly small as he falls further behind. We now consider how long the recipient of a new transaction needs to wait before being sufficiently certain the sender can't change the transaction. We assume the sender is an attacker who wants to make the recipient believe he paid him for a while, then switch it to pay back to himself after some time has passed. The receiver will be alerted when that happens, but the sender hopes it will be too late. The receiver generates a new key pair and gives the public key to the sender shortly before signing. This prevents the sender from preparing a chain of blocks ahead of time by working on it continuously until he is lucky enough to get far enough ahead, then executing the transaction at that moment. Once the transaction is sent, the dishonest sender starts working in secret on a parallel chain containing an alternate version of his transaction. The recipient waits until the transaction has been added to a block and z blocks have been linked after it. He doesn't know the exact amount of progress the attacker has made, but assuming the honest blocks took the average expected time per block, the attacker's potential progress will be a Poisson distribution with expected value: =z q p To get the probability the attacker could still catch up now, we multiply the Poisson density for each amount of progress he could have made by the probability he could catch up from that point: ∑ k=0 ∞  k e − k! ⋅{ q/ p z−k  if k≤z 1 if kz} Rearranging to avoid summing the infinite tail of the distribution... 1−∑ k=0 z  k e − k! 1−q/ p z−k   Converting to C code... #include  double AttackerSuccessProbability\(double q, int z\) {  double p = 1.0 \- q;  double lambda = z \* \(q / p\);  double sum = 1.0;  int i, k;  for \(k = 0; k \<= z; k\+\+\)  {  double poisson = exp\(\-lambda\);  for \(i = 1; i \<= k; i\+\+\)  poisson \*= lambda / i;  sum \-= poisson \* \(1 \- pow\(q / p, z \- k\)\);  }  return sum; } 7 Running some results, we can see the probability drop off exponentially with z. q=0.1 z=0 P=1.0000000 z=1 P=0.2045873 z=2 P=0.0509779 z=3 P=0.0131722 z=4 P=0.0034552 z=5 P=0.0009137 z=6 P=0.0002428 z=7 P=0.0000647 z=8 P=0.0000173 z=9 P=0.0000046 z=10 P=0.0000012 q=0.3 z=0 P=1.0000000 z=5 P=0.1773523 z=10 P=0.0416605 z=15 P=0.0101008 z=20 P=0.0024804 z=25 P=0.0006132 z=30 P=0.0001522 z=35 P=0.0000379 z=40 P=0.0000095 z=45 P=0.0000024 z=50 P=0.0000006 Solving for P less than 0.1&#37;...

Conclusion We have proposed a system for electronic transactions without relying on trust. We started with the usual framework of coins made from digital signatures, which provides strong control of ownership, but is incomplete without a way to prevent double\-spending. To solve this, we proposed a peer\-to\-peer network using proof\-of\-work to record a public history of transactions that quickly becomes computationally impractical for an attacker to change if honest nodes control a majority of CPU power. The network is robust in its unstructured simplicity. Nodes work all at once with little coordination. They do not need to be identified, since messages are not routed to any particular place and only need to be delivered on a best effort basis. Nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the proof\-of\-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone. They vote with their CPU power, expressing their acceptance of valid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on them. Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism. ";0;1;False;Israel73;dz8qqqi;1 BTC is hidden in this puzzle. Good luck!;8kk0pa;https://i.redd.it/g4rbvtbiwry01.png

"A seed doesn't ""contain"" keys, it produces them. The creation is done using one way functions, so it is not possible to derive the seed phrase from existing keys, although there are possible ways you could serialize your existing keys using a word dictionary, existing wallets using the BIP-32 and BIP-39 standards create the seed first, then derive the keys.

The seed, created by BIP-39, is made from 128 to 256 bits of random entropy. A checksum of `first(sha256(entropy), size(entropy)/32)` is appended to the end, making for example 132 bits, or 264 bits.

This sequence is then broken into 11 bit chunks, and each 11 bits represents an index in a fixed dictionary of 2048 words.

So to regenerate the entropy from the words, you find the index of each word in the dictionary, append that index into a sequence of bits, then finally, the size/32 bits should be cut from the end, as they're the checksum on the entropy. You run sha256 on the remaining bit sequence and confirm that the checksum matches the first size/32 bits of the resulting hash.

HMAC-SHA512 is then used with the seed entropy as the key and pbkdf2(""mnemonic<PASSPHRASE>"") as the salt, with ""<PASSPHRASE>"" being determined by the user. The first 256 bits are used as the master private key. The second 256 bits are used as the ""chain code"", for generating further private keys in a deterministic way. Essentially, the master private key is concatenated with an index, in normalized 4-byte form, meaning 2^32 possible child keys, and then HMAC-SHA512 is performed again, using the chain code as the secret. The full process of this is defined in BIP-32, but you can have an arbitrary nested hierarchy of wallets because each HMAC produces another private key and chain code which effectively work as the seed for another possible 2^32 keys.

For detailed reading, you should check out Andreas Antonopoulos's book ""Mastering Bitcoin"", as it has examples of deriving these using Python and libbitcoin. There are several other implementations in different languages. If you check the [BIPs](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips) they list various implementations at the end of the document.";5;0;False;DistinctSituation;dz8px9g;1 BTC is hidden in this puzzle.

"Each word is essentially a numeric value. The words could have been completely different, what is important is that they are universally adopted and represent these numeric values across all programs.

Say you have a 12 word seed. Those words are essentially a 12 letter password, but the language they are written in has 2048 letters to choose from instead of 26 letters in the English alphabet, because there are 2048 bip 39 words.

These 2048 words were carefully chosen to be easy to memorize, by selecting words that were easily recognized, selecting common words that are unique and hard to confused, they are all short and unique after the first 3 characters. By eliminating words of a common theme such as 'woman and women' if you can't remember the word but can remember how the word starts or the theme of the word you reduce your chances of looking your seed.

This is all to bridge the gap between the complexity required for cryptographically secure seeds and our brain's insistence that life be made as simple and lazy as possible.";7;0;False;Nursing_guy;dz8p558;1 BTC is hidden in this puzzle. Good luck!;8kk0pa;https://i.redd.it/g4rbvtbiwry01.png

As long as we have perameters to work with, we can quickly reduce the possibilities.

"OK I think I might be onto something derived from this list. There are exactly 12 words that are in the bitcoin paper AND in BIP39 that are oriented horizontally within the BTC logo, and exactly 12 additional words that are oriented about 40 deg. to the left.

These two lists of words are (sorted by order in which they appear in the whitepaper):

cash pool rely order next agree zero modify run race gap early 

problem proof attack since ability end entire know sign post fee find

If we use a 24 word seed, again, using the order in the whitepaper we get these lists (depending on which order you combine the two lists, or just all 24 words in the order in the paper):
 
cash problem proof pool attack rely since ability order next end entire know sign agree post zero modify run fee find race gap early

problem proof attack since ability end entire know sign post fee find cash pool rely order next agree zero modify run race gap early

cash pool rely order next agree zero modify run race gap early problem proof attack since ability end entire know sign post fee find

However none of these have valid mnemonics according to https://iancoleman.io/bip39/#english and I've tried to enter them as BIP39 seed phrases in wallets without success.

"Can't get this but feel i'm close. 

There's 24 words within the border (all of which can be used in the bip39 sys),
here they are listed in the order they appear in the original white paper:

one main still network power come process since size ability paper coin next issue way know model able modify speed help old place want

This didn't work when I tested it though.

Interestingly, all the math formulas in this are in the Whitepaper (last page) and the dates correlate exactly with the years and months of the references at the bottom of the PDF (e.g. ""199905"" = the 2nd reference published May 1999)

I believe all the numbers and equations are a distraction from the real answer, which is a 24 mnemonic code. 

To get access to the wallet / test word orders. You can download the Electrum Wallet and then put in the public address of this account (3CcxyPhyvyc3S9UuPfu42GNZLvVVV11Uk8). 

Then, you can go to https://iancoleman.io/bip39/ to test out your phrases (options for 12 - 24 word mnemonic phrases) which in combination with the public key will give you access to the private key.

Then, you go back to your Electrum wallet, under 'wallet' ---> private keys ---> sweep you can place in the private key and get full access to the wallet and send the 1BTC to yourself :)

"All of the words found in the image are also found in the whitepaper, so nothing odd there. 

This means there must be something else which 'marks' special words making up the seed, as well as specifying their order, since I don't think we're supposed to bruteforce the seed order.

Currently the only thing in the image that might mark words AND specify their order seems to be the white borders.

"Let me mentally break this down for myself and maybe others here can fill in gaps in my thought process.

- It's either a private key or a seed (with or without additional password).

- It's either hidden in the image itself and can be found through its shapes, lines, position, coloring or its hidden in the words and numbers and a correlation must be found here

If its a private key we must think of the format. As far as I can remember it can be either binary 256 bits. It can be HEX, 64 digits or it is WIF or WIF-compressed. I somehow don't think its binary because that would be too long. It wont be WIF or WIF-compressed either as these have lower and upper case characters, which does not seem the case in this picture. The capital letters found in the image are merely direct copy/pastes from the whitepaper. HEX seems to make the most sense.

If its HEX we got to look for letters and digits. But the order of those is the issue obviously.

If its a seed it makes sense to filter the words in the image for those compliant with a BIP list. One thing bothering me is the numbers. Some can be found in the whitepaper, like the 4 digit ones, representing years. But others can not be found at all in the whitepaper, nor are they seed words. They have to have meaning. And then there's the notdef glyph..

"Not people who work at bank of america, or chase. The people who work and operate those banks are typically working class people. So I guess I am just confused as to why protesting against business occupied mostly by working class people seems to be a better target than a more fundamental issue that lies deeper at the core of the issue. Not necessarily saying it's wrong or anything. But it's like... why bother trying to demonize bank branches as opposed to demonizing central banking, like the federal reserve?

I mean, I don't bitch at nike or apple for fucked up human labor, I don't bitch at farmers for unfair farming practices, I don't bitch at doctors for health care issues because I realize that all stems from a more fundamental problem and it seems almost time wasting to be fighting symptoms as opposed to fighting the thing that made all this mess in the first place. Feel like this problem would have been dealt with a long time ago if we were more focused on things like the Federal Reserve and less on Chase and Bank of america, is all.

I understand the symbolism, but you got to remember most people are pretty stupid and won't connect the dots that way. They will just demonize bank of america. Which might mitigate the issue, but it definitely won't solve it. Just kinda been tired of mitigating the problem over and over again while the true problem goes largely unnoticed by most of the population. 

I dunno... just feel like killing a hydra by stabbing it's heart is far more affective then by simply cutting off a few of it's thousands of heads.

">governments will do what is in the best interests of themselves

That is true of some governments. The American government is an example. If my government could improve things by deflating, they surely would. It is far more democratic here. I have lived in America too.

If those people stay away from Bitcoin, Bitcoin will not go global. If you're okay with that then that's up to you and what you want out of Bitcoin. That's what it's about. I believe it can go global, but it has to adapt slightly (not give up its values) to appeal to a larger audience. Decentralisation and deflation don't matter to me (although I understand why decentralisation matters to Americans), but I see value in instant transactions peer to peer and the removal of merchant fees that will help small companies.";1;1;False;isoldmywifeonEbay;dz8zkhz;Banks on fire, by Alex Schaefer;8kf5y3;https://i.redd.it/drnal7l2lny01.jpg
"Well banks are corporations that must operate under our laws. The federal reserve is a private institution that doesn't necessarily. They don't even have to fully disclose what it is they do. Not only that, but the federal reserve is what gives our country money in exchange for bonds. 

I understand that banks have fractional reserve practices, which makes the practice of loaning harmful to our value of money, but the Federal reserve are the institutions that finance banks and somewhat give them their purpose in the first place. 

Using the Fed as our source of making money seems like a much higher priority than complaining about Bank Of America, considering without the federal reserve there probably wouldn't even be a BoA anyways. Just wonder why we keep trying to solve issues without even addressing the underlying issue that made it that way to begin with.

Central banking systems are messed up, especially since our fed reserve is neither federal, nor a reserve.

"Yes reduced spending and a reduction in jobs would follow. 

Better is entirely subjective because what is ""good"" or ""right"" is entirely subjective. Anyone who understands the consequences and how they align with their beliefs are perfectly qualified to say what is ""better""

So yes the end result a deflationary currency would have on society would certainly be ""better"" in my opinion.

I also highly question your assumption that ""If financial experts knew it was better, that's what governments would be doing."" ; in fact I believe assumption this to be dangerously naive. ""Better"" is subjective and it is naive to believe that governments will do what is in the best interests of those they govern. From both a historical and modern standpoint it would be far more rational to assume that governments will do what is in the best interests of themselves and their acquaintances. Sometimes that aligns with the interests of the governed; often it does not.

Yes; what other people care about impacts me; but their beliefs in no way impact my beliefs or understanding. I'm not interested in ""pitching"" Bitcoin to anyone who doesn't care in decentralization or deflationary currency/assets. In fact I hope those people who don't care about these properties stay away from Bitcoin for as long as possible.

Bitcoins revolutionary breakthrough is not about ""instant transactions"" or free payments. We already have that with fiat. Paying by credit card is a superior user experience and will be for some time. People are not converting to Bitcoin because their CC isn't convenient.

"i think ""burning"" imagery and stuff is pretty extreme and obviously (hopefully) not something anyone is literally thinking of doing, or gives any merit. 

but i dont think anyone should discredit the desire for change as ""edgy"". it's easy to forget that every major social change has been brought about by a younger generation getting tired of the rules and ways of life the older generation put in place. 

its also going to happen regardless, and if the majority of people don't like the direction a society is going then it's the majority's responsibility to somehow change it. part of that change will require vocalized complaints. 

99% of america DOESNT like the direction america is going. if youre right wing you think having 98 genders is stupid (it is) and if youre left wing then you think the idea that ""racism is dead"" is stupid (it also is).

these petty arguments are a convenient distraction when you realize that everyone kinda agrees that the REASON everything is going to shit is because the people in charge (banks, police, politicians) are letting it. 

you'd probably agree with most ""edgy teen"" opinions, its just that theyre communicated by teenagers, who are extreme and riled up and overly hormonal.

Economic growth is not the end all be all of human happiness and prosperity. 

A slave can be forced to work hard labor up to 18 hours a day ; whereas a freeman is often productive for less than 8 hours. If we organize labor such that 90% of the population is enslaved the other 10% would certainly enjoy the greatest economic growth imaginable.

Moving from a debt-based to a capital-based currency/society would likely be accompanied by reduced economic growth; as people would spend less on unnecessary consumption and opt for future gains. This would highlight all the useless endeavors that people work their lives away for. Many unnecessary jobs will vanish.

"Again, I think it comes down to timeframe. Indeed there are some prohibitive issues presently, such as the private key one. I think it's reasonable to assume solutions will come about eventually. The economic incentive and transformative potential to innovating within this problem\-space are too high to be ignored.

Let's not forget banks consist of people. A centralised organisation is just one of many ways said people could interact with the world. Blockchain provides a new menu of people structures that could emulate \(or better, exceed\) the services and products of traditional financial institutions, including the ones you mention.

Per the financial history remark, unlike now, blockchain will make such information effortless to disclose. Obfuscating risk through complex formulae \(i.e. the subprime mortgage scandal\) will be difficult as everything published will fall under the scrutiny of the open\-source community, similar to peer review. As a contributor to said formulae, you will be compensated in proportion to the profits others make using your risk management smart contract. It is therefore in your financial interest not to defraud your userbase, which wasn't the case in 2009.

I understand the world I'm describing seems quite radical from a contemporary viewpoint. I don't expect any of this to happen without considerable time and turbulence between now and this potentially fairer future.

It's very possible I've overlooked many things in this admittedly speculative overview of blockchain potential. My fundamental point is that banks are an arbitrary entity and needn't necessarily exist as humanity advances.

"I read over your comment again, and I don't know why I bothered, because you said no such thing.

Let me paraphrase :

Don't discount teens as edge because they're the vehicles of change. (I directly disagreed with this, and stated if this change were to occur as the teens it today see it, it would be a poor move and would cost lives)

Change it going to happen regardless of if I agree with teens or not and it's the masses' responsibility to implement this (I don't think buildings will be burnt, at least not with the support of the masses, and i disagree that this change needs to be implemented)

America doesn't like where America is going. The reason is because the people in charge are letting it (no, the reason is political divide and lack of empathy, which nowhere in this message is this to blame for you. You're blaming the older generation and people in charge)

I'd agree with most teen opinions if they were expressed more moderately (no I wouldn't, I'm directly disputing what you and those teens are suggesting, that there's some established elite causing this and they need to be ripped out and replaced.)

Edge teens are edgy jaded old farts are jaded, but they fundamentally agree and aren't arguing (no, they actually are, everyone is arguing. Even the 2 of us. If you feel I agreed with your message so absolutely, you completely failed to communicate yourself on every level.)

I really cannot grasp how you imagine I repeated your message. I disagreed with basically everything you said and you replied with EXACTLY, DUH! Maybe read over your own message again.";1;1;False;Voidward;dz8xycn;Banks on fire, by Alex Schaefer;8kf5y3;https://i.redd.it/drnal7l2lny01.jpg

"A truly decentralised currency is governed by everyone through consensus.

For a change to take place, developers must write Improvement Proposals and make Pull Requests (both of which are democratically arbitrated).

Following this, the majority of full-nodes must run the new code. The final vote is then cast by the market, which evaluates each blockchain's worth after a hard-fork.

Bitcoin Cash is an example of the network rejecting a change to block-size. Had the network accepted it, Bitcoin Cash would be Bitcoin Core.
