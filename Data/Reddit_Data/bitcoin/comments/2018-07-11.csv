"Because the price of bitcoin at any given time is the function of the current supply and demand. If two people want to buy one bitcoin at a price of 5 dollars, and there's only one bitcoin being sold at the current moment they decide to buy, and each have five dollars to spend then they'll each get 0.5 bitcoin as the price of that bitcoin will increase organically to 10 dollars. This process happens individually on each exchange over and over millions of times per day, that's what dictates the price of bitcoin. It's just a function of the current supply and demand at any given moment. 

If tomorrow absolutely nobody wanted to buy bitcoin, literally nobody, the price would hit ZERO dollars. (Bitcoin would essentially be worthless)

if tomorrow absolutely nobody would sell their bitcoin, no matter what the price, the price would hit INFINITY dollars. (Bitcoin essentially becomes priceless)

Obviously neither scenario is practical, and the current price of bitcoin is somewhere in between those two extremes. ";1;1;False;;e27foo9;just saying, this is the time to get in.;8xukfn;https://i.redd.it/cxx7jcynj7911.png

Because in order for people to sell they need to sell into lower and lower buy orders because people want to sell more than they want to buy.

Do they? I've never heard anyone talk about fees driving market demand before. In fact, when fees were highest is when BTC began crashing from ATH. I've been under the impression that investors mostly just want to see trade volume. Which can happen at any price point, no way to predict really. And it's the trade volume that drives the fees up, because the mempool gets overburdened. But the fees themselves no one really cares about, until they get too high because it makes trading slightly less profitable. And it makes smaller transactions become financially impossible, which hurts bitcoins fundamentals a bit, not that bitcoin fundamentals are ever what's driving the price.;3;1;False;Raster_Eyes;e26p2o5;just saying, this is the time to get in.;8xukfn;https://i.redd.it/cxx7jcynj7911.png

"That's how I see this too - it was created to be independent of the existing financial system, so if something seriously blows up in that system, Bitcoin theoretically should be a stable island, like gold. But there's also this effect that when investors get scared, they run back to USD (even if USD is the problem) - here in Poland USD slowly fell down to almost 2 PLN before 2008, and then in 2008 it jumped back towards 4 and it was bouncing between 3-4 PLN since then (and we were the one country in EU untouched by the crisis).

"Exactly, I saw the market crash and sold everything at \~$19k (while it was still on its way up.) I got in when it was in the $700s- well, I started mining then. Unfortunately, I was unemployed at the time and for a long period living off my mining profits, so even though I knew I was loosing out when I had to hit up the bitcoin ATM for food money, I really didn't have an option. In the end I only had a few bitcoin left to sell, but being that I bought my mining equipment when bitcoin had just started to dip back then, my $7000 investment for a few S9s (and later some scrypt miners just before the market took off) still paid off- I do wish I hadn't been lazy and had just gotten a job so I could have held onto all my earnings.

What people don't or neglected to realize is that until 2017, bitcoin markets were rudimentary. Bitcoin followed a natural supply-demand price curve. Sure there were ups and downs, but due solely to demand (or lack thereof.) 2017 ushered in the market, easy ways to convert fiat to BTC and that's what created the massive upsurge, then the market started to dictate the price. There were other assets trading in high volumes against bitcoin for the first time. Bitcoin became the way into the altcoin market. The problem was, altcoins were trading 95&#37; on speculation- most having no actual inherent value. Add to that the fact that 90&#37; of tokens were scams that looked great unless you had the technical expertise to poke holes in their whitepapers and roadmaps.

Bitcoin jumped from $5k-$10k-$20k in what, 5 weeks, then you had all these so-called experts saying it was headed for $80k. So everyone gets in at $20k and loses 50&#37; in a week.

I know people that got in at $1,200. I told them to sell at $18k, again at $20k (but they said ""you said to sell at $18k so what do you know"") then it hit $10k-$12k and I said sell, but everyone was so sure it would rebound. Then it dips below $6k and these people are acting like they took such a massive loss. THEY STILL MADE &#37;500 IN PROFITS IN UNDER A YEAR- but the fact that they had the chance to make so much more, they are still acting like they lost.";1;1;False;Mypassispass123;e27mqux;just saying, this is the time to get in.;8xukfn;https://i.redd.it/cxx7jcynj7911.png
