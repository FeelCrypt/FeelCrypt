"Close to the right meme.

What we need is a blatant hypocracy meme, or like the crying ladies pointing at the confused cat

Crying lady: (nocoiners) ""cryptos have no value!!""

other lady: (labelled 'IRS' ""wait they do need to pay taxes"")

cat: (I am not in the US, your rules don't apply, visible confusion etc)

EDIT: also the cat needs to be wearing a bitcoin hat and driving a very small lambo";1;0;False;walloon5;f05l8j6;Governments;d3iay0;https://i.redd.it/yw8fyklxq9m31.jpg

Are you perhaps confusing median and mean? If not, I feel like your point could use some sources/evidence;3;1;False;Infamous_Noone;f05seyy;Governments;d3iay0;https://i.redd.it/yw8fyklxq9m31.jpg

"If by traceable you mean you can trace public key's I'd have to say you're absolutely correct.  Unfortunately, for all intents and purposes that means very little to any government as it would be very hard to directly associate a wallet's public ID with a person's legitimate identity.  [Here's the president of the Boston Federal Reserve responding to a question about crypto.](https://youtu.be/8sXI8Ux5F8w?t=2524)  My earlier comment was practically paraphrasing what he said(as I am fairly certain this is the most recent Government address of cryptocurrency adoption).  

It is fairly well known that laundering is incredibly easy to do using crypto and the only way to solve that would be by having personal information attached to our wallets that governments would have access to, something that I feel would dilute some of the appeals.  

I am not against crypto, but the bandwagon on this sub is pretty intense, it's fairly easy to understand why major governments are amped to adopt right away. 

Also if you're at all interested in the U.S.'s current economic standing I'd definitely recommend that video I attached Rosengren pretty much breaks it all down.";0;1;False;I_Wgglz;f05oo9i;Governments;d3iay0;https://i.redd.it/yw8fyklxq9m31.jpg
You could SAY they have no value, but then you could also take them to any exchange and get a pile of fiat for them, so clearly they are not worthless...;1;1;False;HODL_monk;f0728dz;Governments;d3iay0;https://i.redd.it/yw8fyklxq9m31.jpg
"You moron.

Do banknotes have your name on them?

Laundering is easy with cash too.

The only thing you can't do with regular cash...is trace it.

I'll say it again. This sub is fucked.";1;0;False;pg3crypto;f06sz1k;Governments;d3iay0;https://i.redd.it/yw8fyklxq9m31.jpg
