"> Do I just put actual cash (debit/credit card) into bitcoin to get started? 

You can also accept it in return for a good or service, just as TigerDirect is doing here.  Or work for it, just like you would cash.  People here sometimes forget that's the best way of getting it, if you can swing it (not everyone has a job where they can change over to being paid in bitcoins but 100,000s of people are getting paid this way today).

> I always hear about people making money on bitcoin, or getting free bitcoins, how? 

In the early days there used to be websites called 'faucets' which would distribute free bitcoins (very few per person but, hey if you had held on to them long enough, the 0.001$ in bitcoin would be 10$ today, which is nothing to snuff on).  I'll let others explain mining.

After a few seconds the alligator starts to feel sick.  ""Uhh, wha.. what did you do to me?  You poisoned me!""  The alligator then faints.

"Virtual means ""having the same virtues or qualities as"". So electronic money that you never touch is every bit as virtual as bitcoin. The problem isn't that it's wrong; it's that it's not descriptive enough. Most money we handle is already virtual - you never touch the real thing. And even the real thing is only real if you believe in it.

The right way to differentiate bitcoin from fiat money is by starting that it's a  decentralized digital peer to peer cryptographic currency.

"Annoying? Literally no one takes the MtGox price seriously. Whenever I check the price of bitcoin I ALWAYS switch to bitstamp or some other exchange.

Take a look at all the exchanges and you'll see them all competitively priced around the same area with MtGox being leagues higher. You were getting the actual market value for your bitcoins.
