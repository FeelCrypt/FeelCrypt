"Spending coins at a huge loss is not irrational per se.  You should read about sunk cost fallacy in decision making before cataloguing others as fools for considering this.
    
Whatever happened in the past should not impact a future decision.  Present decisions should be based purely on your expactation for the future and your current needs.     
Some should consider if spending the lossy coins allows one to offset tax liability on current fiat income.

"**Median**

The median is the value separating the higher half from the lower half of a data sample (a population or a probability distribution). For a data set, it may be thought of as the ""middle"" value. For example, in the data set {1, 3, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9}, the median is 6, the fourth largest, and also the fourth smallest, number in the sample. For a continuous probability distribution, the median is the value such that a number is equally likely to fall above or below it.

"I know this is not a popular thing to say, but I think it's time for a new Cryptocurrency. Surely not anything in existence currently, but Bitcoin is more than a decade old. When it was created, the technological landscape was so different. Everyone had a PC or a Laptop, now 70% of Americans exclusively use mobile devices for non-work related activities. That number is just going to keep tilting towards mobile devices, leading to more centralization and a network not equipped to run natively on mobile devices. Mining is incredibly inefficient and has become completely centralized among a few major pools. The 10 minute block time sets the limit on transaction confirmation time and it will never be able to compete with other central payment platforms.

I'm not saying Bitcoin isn't revolutionary, but at its core it is just a piece of software. Software can be upgraded only for so long before a new edition must be released.

Certainly taking from bitcoins concepts, and learning from its mistakes, I believe the next revolution could begin. I can't think of a single time in history anyone has ever gotten something 100% right the first time.

I think the only reason there hasn't been development is because the current system is still making a lot of people money on a daily basis (I mean the companies involved.)

I have nothing bad to say of bitcoin, I just think that  with the right motivations and the correct team, something completely new could arise that solves all the pitfalls of the Blockchain 1.0 Cryptocurrencies.";1;2;False;Nycmdthroaway;ed5p2i7;Judge bitcoin by yearly lows, not all time highs.;abznev;https://i.redd.it/3n7l1vlmp3821.jpg

"Bitcoin, and the framework that led to it being required and developed, is complex.  Very few people actually understand how money works.  That is not likely to change quickly, if ever.  The base in bitcoin is the people that understand and want to enable their own financial sovereignty, and do it with a technological solution. 

It used to be a very small number of people.  10 years ago it was vanishingly small.  That group of people has grown over time.  The people who use nodes to secure their bitcoin.  Along with them have come the shysters and charlatans. They've hyped up crypto to be more than the people who want financial sovereignty have ever cared about. 

Then the hype bursts, but that original group is double its size.  And then it doubled again. It's still tiny.  Probably justifying $250 a coin.  And then a new set of hype merchants try to separate you from your bitcoin.  And then the bitcoin hodlers double again.  All the while these people say you need protect your bitcoin.  Secure your keys. Every time the hype bursts, a new set of salty scammers abandon crypto. 

The actual value in bitcoin, and crypto, is tiny.  These market caps mean nothing.  I suspect that a single one billion dollar buy of bitcoin would double its price at least, and that metric is even more pronounced in alts.

Great plan, Frogolocalypse.  So now the whole world knows that all they have to do to steal all your bitcoin is figure out where you put those volumes, and what your password is.  Since you mentioned that you don't store them in your house, we can pretty easily guess that they're stored in the cloud somewhere.  Because if you're too cheap to buy a hardware wallet, you're definitely too cheap to put anything in a safe deposit box.  And you're probably bad at picking and remembering passwords, so the password to those TrueCrypt volumes is probably the same or similar to a password that you use for one or several of your online accounts, one or two of which has probably been compromised at some point.  Not to mention that all I need in order to steal all your bitcoin is infect the machine that you use to decrypt your TrueCrypt volumes - which, even if you use the ""air-gapped"" PC to decrypt them, means you will have to move your volumes back to it on an infect-able medium.  Keyloggers are a thing.  Malware can easily hitch a ride on whatever you use to move those files around.

The whole reason for having a hardware wallet is to ensure that nobody can access your private keys, not even you - you can only make your hardware wallet sign transactions using your private keys.

"This looks like it may have been a misunderstanding. When he said ""run your own node"" he was not referring to running a *mining* node, but rather a *fully-validating* node (or ""full node"" for short).

In the first couple of years of Bitcoin's existence, the word ""node"" was used interchangeably to refer to either of these things. The mining functionality was eventually abstracted away from the validation functionality, allowing ASICs designed solely around hyper-efficient double-SHA256 performance to be hooked up to full nodes (which handle all the rest of Bitcoin's network operation). Since then, ""node"" has generally been used to refer to the non-mining client (which miners, or pools of miners, hook up to).

The advantage of running a node without a miner attached to it is that you're using Bitcoin without having to trust others; you're *validating things for yourself*. It also helps to preserve financial privacy. Pieter Wuille (a legendary Bitcoin developer) offered [a fantastic explanation](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/3eq3y7/full_node_question/ctk4lnd) about this, if you're interested in reading more.

The reason why /u/Frogolocalypse assumed you were being disingenuous is that a small and hostile splinter community of anti-Bitcoin extremists (who unfortunately control both the ""btc"" subreddit and bitcoindotcom domain name) have been trying to spread the misinformation that ""non-mining nodes aren't nodes at all, and (somehow) hurt the Bitcoin network"" for years now... this is one of many myths that the Bitcoin community has been working to debunk through grassroots efforts.

Hopefully that helps to clear this up, and hopefully you can see why he might have made the assumption that he did. He was encouraging running a fully validating node and it seemed to him like you were trying to imply that if it wasn't a miner, it wasn't a node.

> ""Won't sell at any price""? 

I'm sure anyone would spend it for material things, once that point is reached and they are ready to dip into savings. But you dont blow all your savings in a day, you keep savings for long periods and spend it slowly.

Hodlers arent going to switch over their saving account from BTC to USD just because the numbers got bigger. Traders might, especially the kind who think in terms of USD. For some reason they are most comfortable when they are dollar bagholders. But hodlers save in BTC for the long haul. They are most comfortable when their savings are 100% btc based.

Another way to tool at it is ""Wont capitulate at any low price"". No matter how high they bought in, the real Holder types arent going to sell just to recoup some small percent - they are in it for the political change they want to see.

So ""Won't sell at any price"" makes perfect sense to me. Hodlers arent going to dump btc savings for dirty fiats savings at any point.

"yearly lows is an equally vapid metric because it could have been from one person’s dump and averaged much higher than the peak low.

Imagine a song: you don’t state “the song was quiet” because there is some tiny number of samples at -inf dB, nor is a song loud because you digitally clipped a sample here and there at peak dB. 

this is why decent speakers output are not measured in only peak RMS

Any decent scatterplot based slope would NOT be altered much by outliers like low/high spikes.

You could get to the same valuation conclusion by simply truncating the bottom 20 and top 20% of the days averages. In fact I’d assert you need to because volume is trivially gamed by those willing to put up scam exhanges OR eat txfees and spam coins to themselves
