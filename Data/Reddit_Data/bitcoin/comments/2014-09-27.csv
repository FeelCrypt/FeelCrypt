"Supposedly there are policies in major companies as well as in government service for being one who speaks up and goes outside of the chain of command to bring up corruption.  The problem is that unfortunately there is a recent and strong change in attitude towards those who do such things in American society at the moment... at least among both corporate and government leaders.

I admire people who go out on a limb and speak up, although they do get hammered down real hard.

I understand it perfectly fine, and it would appear moreso than you do. It is a fine example of a libertarian issue, not a bitcoin issue.

"I have found the exact opposite.  Most critics refuse to accept the Bible, particularly the New Testament, even when compared to other contemporary literature (meaning stuff written about 1 AD give or take a few centuries).

No other external collaboration is even considered and if there is any such collaboration it is treated as if that external evidence is automatically suspect simply because it might confirm a minor point in the New Testament.

I have never see this kind of visceral hatred of any other kind of document and flat out refusing to even consider using something in the New Testament for historic reference.

I'm not denying anything, but I'm not putting special importance on Jesus as a historic figure either. The interest revolves around the claims made about him being as a deity, which is also the one of the roots of his popular success. Had no such claim been made, you probably would never have heard about him.

"You insistence here of extending this conversation only proves my point.  The New Testament is not respected as an historical document.  Using it as an historical reference in any manner only diminishes the value of whatever scholarly paper is involved and is better left out entirely even if the historical reference is entirely appropriate.  It certainly is toxic even compared to other potential sources written about the same time.

You are the one trying to make religious claims about Jesus that I am not.

I'll also note that Jesus was hardly the first person to be asserted as the son of God.  Each one of the various Caesars, several Viking rulers, Egyptian Pharoahs (who claimed to be the son of the Sun) and even the current Emperor of Japan all claim that same title.  That is really the dime a dozen claim if I ever heard of one.

Your claims here do not justify why this Jewish rabbi has been the founder of one of the most significant religious movements of all of history and sounds like you really don't understand him or his message either.  As an historic person, Jesus certain should be examined and studied if only for this kind of impact he has had upon the world through his adherants, which seems to be what you are denying  never exist either.";0;1;False;rshorning;cku0tfq;The Secret Goldman Sachs Tapes - The reporter, Jake Bernstein, has obtained 47½ hours of tape recordings, made secretly by a Federal Reserve employee, of conversations within the Fed, and between the Fed and Goldman Sachs.

>No, the whole story revolves around a Jewish rabbi who lived in the Roman province of Judea during the reign of Caesar Augustus and a little later who preached a doctrine that perhaps we ought not kill each other and that it might be good to be nice to one another from time to time.

Yeah, that's the inconsequential and trivial story that nobody would have cared about, *had they also not claimed it was said by the son of god(!)*. Nothing Jesus said was truly new, but a rehash of other philosophies.

>You are precisely the kind of person I was referring to here, as somebody who takes a head smacking obvious historical figure and warps it way out of proportion. 

I don't. The New Testament does.

>Jesus never claimed to be an all-powerful deity, although many of his followers have presumed that role for him. Find any red letters in such an edition of the New Testament where Jesus claims to be that all powerful deity.

Jesus didn't write a single letter in the New Testament. Every single thing said of, or supposedly by, Jesus was written by some else. This makes it irrelevant whether or not Jesus actually claimed to be a deity or not, since we aren't going by the trivialities of the *red letters*, but by the whole packages: The New Testament.

>The role of resurrection and the miracles performed by Jesus are not the things I'm talking about in terms of history as those are precisely the things of faith.

I agree, which renders the New Testament trivial and inconsequential.

>You can, in my opinion, separate out that religious belief stuff and at least acknowledge that the historical man that was Jesus at least existed a couple thousand years ago.

Trivial.

>Furthermore, there is some validity in terms of the ethics preached by Jesus too and worth studying on its own merits rather than getting all crazy about how many angels you can put on the head of a pin.

As a moral philosopher he's a dime a dozen. He makes some assertions as to how people should treat each other, but not really why. This is where the Bible relied on the authority of a god to work its wonders. He's ***only*** interesting due to the claim that he's the son of a god.

Regarding Superman: My point was that no matter how much the different authors of the Gospels corroborate each other, or other independent text that may verify the existence of a historical Jesus, doesn't lend any credibility to the claim that Jesus was the son of a god.

Just like no matter how many different editions and authors of Superman comics all agree that Metropolis was founded in 1785, does that lend any credibility to the claim that Metropolis is a real city.

TL;DR Whether or not Jesus existed is ***only*** of any importance, whatsoever, if you argue that The New Testament's description of him holds true.

I guess I just took offence without understanding the concept of ""fiscal liberals"". Perhaps because I associate with the concept of liberal. It's a word I like. For me, it means freedom. It was how I was raised. I think you were raised in a different place where it was negative. Here in bitcoin, we both meet as equals and understand the same thing.

I'm a free software guy. I first met some awesome people working on free software. I made the mistake of thinking they were all going to be ""liberal"" people like me. Why not! We were working on freedom! Then I met one of the most awesome free software guys (Eric Raymond) and he was a staunch libertarian/republican gun toting opposite of me!

"You keep saying that this submission is violating the sub's rules. I've explained several times that it's not. The submission is not directly pertaining to Bitcoin, but it's obviously highly relevant to Bitcoin and our readers' interests. The submission is also not 'general financial news'. It's not about a new VISA partnership, or rewards programs, or stock market action. It's a big story that has broad implications for global financial sectors. The mods may not always be perfectly consistent in every case, but in this case we certainly are. I think you need to take a few moments to parse the rule more carefully.

There's nothing tinfoil hat about pointing out topic dilution, and your accusation is quite baseless. 

Again, this post does not violate any of the sub's rules. Removing a thread with nearly 4000 points and 700 comments simply because a handful of readers either disagree with the story or don't feel it's relevant would indeed be censorship. I'm not aware of a better word to describe it. Not only do mods disagree with censorship, but such a move would be highly unpopular with the vast majority of readers.

I don't understand why you feel it's appropriate to attack me personally while downvoting and reporting my posts. I understand you're not happy about this submission and don't acknowledge its relevance to this sub, but it's rather silly to claim I'm acting egotistically.

"you should check out the [gospel of mary](http://www.maryofmagdala.com/GMary_Text/gmary_text.html), it backs up this point of view quite well.

When you get down to it, pretty much every 'true' religion (i'm using that to ignore things like scientology, which are clearly power/money grabs) boils down to 'we're all the same, be excellent to each other'. They all trend towards teaching people the path to reaching the peak/mystic state, so they can feel the unending love of knowing that you and the universe are one.

But it always ends up the same way - people misinterpret the message, either intentionally or unintentionally, then you end up with religious dogma. Taoism and Buddhism have resisted this fairly well, most likely through VERY careful language choices - but even they ended up 'corrupted', with people following the dogma without even knowing that it illuminates a path to nirvana, one that anyone can follow if they know it's there.";1;1;False;dpekkle;cktsxlr;The Secret Goldman Sachs Tapes - The reporter, Jake Bernstein, has obtained 47½ hours of tape recordings, made secretly by a Federal Reserve employee, of conversations within the Fed, and between the Fed and Goldman Sachs.

"Yeah...what do you mean there is nothing we can do?

If you are in the sub, you are already doing it.

You are making a choice to learn about an alternative financial system, where this kind of bureaucracy, void of regulatory power, absolute corruption of compliance by private banks like Goldman Sachs is replaced with unbreakable computer code that can never violate itself. The only regulation blockchains need is either acceptance of the code or not by distributed consensus. 

It's clear how far gone the current system is broken. There is no fixing this, ever. There is only replacement from the ground up. Blockchains were born to do just that.

">In her ruling on Wednesday, Abrams also rejected a move by Stengle for greater disclosure by the judge about her husband's relationship with Goldman Sachs. Abrams disclosed on April 3 that she had just learned that her husband, Greg Andres, a partner at Davis Polk & Wardwell, was representing Goldman in an advisory capacity.
 
>Stengle said at the time she would not seek Abrams' recusal, the judge said, and went ahead the next day with scheduled oral arguments on the defendants' bid to dismiss the case.
 
>But on April 11, Stengle made a written request for a ""more complete disclosure"" of Andres' relationship with Goldman, and Abrams' own working relationship with another defense lawyer.
 
>Abrams said that was too late, given that Segarra by then would have had a chance to ""sample the temper of the court"" and perhaps anticipate she would lose unless Abrams recused herself. ""The timing of plaintiff's requests suggests that she is engaging in precisely the type of 'judge-shopping' the 2nd Circuit has cautioned against,"" Abrams wrote, referring to the federal appeals court in New York. ""Such an attempt to engage in judicial game-playing strikes at the core of our legal system.""

"Satoshi was pretty vague about his distrust of the FED.

>Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on **financial institutions serving as
trusted third parties to process electronic payments**. While the system works well enough for
most transactions, it still suffers from the **inherent weaknesses of the trust based model**.
Completely non-reversible transactions are not really possible, since financial institutions cannot
avoid mediating disputes. The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the
minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions,
and there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for nonreversible
services. With the possibility of reversal, the need for trust spreads. Merchants must
be wary of their customers, hassling them for more information than they would otherwise need.
A certain percentage of fraud is accepted as unavoidable. These costs and payment uncertainties
can be avoided in person by using physical currency, but no mechanism exists to make payments
over a communications channel without a trusted party.

Not the FED, just financial institutions in general.

"My mistake, I thought you were referring to the CNN interview, which I've not seen, only scanned a transcript of.

Since you seem to be a most devoted defender of Reza Aslan, I will assume you are completely unbiased and objective.

It couldn't possibly be that you are simply replying because you enjoy provoking a response from me... like a troll would.

I do admit complete ignorance of his book (other than his own descriptions of it). I then explained (with sufficient clarity for anyone who's not the leader of the Reza Aslan fan club, apparently) why I don't plan to waste my time reading critiques of Christianity penned by a Muslim who also happens to be a shrill shill.

You'll just have to deal with that, or come stand outside my window at night and read the book at the top of your lungs. No interest in communicating with you further.

You are now tagged as ""President of the Reza Aslan Fan Club"".

Edit: As for #2, I was saying that a brief verbal nod that Christ was crucified does not count as an equal criticism to an entire book, anymore than a buried retraction in a newspaper balances out a front-page headline.
