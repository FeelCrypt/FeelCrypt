"This seems dramatically overstated. If Satoshi has/had a million btc, that would be, at most, about a 5% increase over expectations of the total long-term btc supply. If the market currently estimates a 50% chance that someone controls that btc, then the effect of coin movement on expectations would be even smaller.

"Many forms of payment, like credit cards, can be reversed after the merchant has been paid. So if you agree to pay $20 at a restaurant and then they actually charge $100 to your card, you can call the credit card company and issue a ""chargeback"". This can sometimes be abused for fraud.

By default Bitcoin doesn't have this feature; it's more like cash or gold coins. If you want consumer protections, then you need to specify a middleman or payment processor to hold the money in escrow ahead of time. That's how apps like OpenBazaar work; the money is held in a ""smart contract"" until the buyer receives his order, and then he releases it to the seller.

The fundamental problem with currency. If you aren't directly trading 1 thing of clear value for another thing of clearly equal value, there's a percentage you can deviate and someone gets the upper hand. It's always the person giving up cash that gets a worse deal than the person who sold them the good. Especially when it is a huge company who uses labor cheaper than the market they are in, (USD for 3rd world goods) helping them drive an even larger profit for themself I steas of coming out pretty equal. Multiply that percentage changing slightly and transactions thousands of times every day and you eventually reach the inflation we see with the USD today where $1 does not buy you even 1/4 of what it did just 50 years a go.

"How did you envision 21 million coins to establish itself as money? 

Overnight? Painlessly? Without volatility?

Did you not imagine that to replace current iterations of ""currency"", the 21 million coins would have to absorb the value of denominations that have trillions of $ of value?

Until that happens, no one will part with their ever increasing store of value. 

See ""Good money drives out bad"": http://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/speculative-attack/

When the ""S-curve"" of adoption approaches the top (slowdown), *THEN* people will feel comfortable spending BTC. Until that time, they will spend the weaker currency. 

This is just fundamental economics.

"Bitcoin has much bigger issues than the government not liking it.

--It's largely deflationary, which historically with national currencies discourages investment, reduces corporate profits, and increases unemployment. In short, if Bitcoin was the main currency it would seriously hinder economic growth.

--Its deflation/inflation rate is extremely volatile. The Bitcoin-USD conversion rate looks much more like a stock price than an inflation curve. How can you know how good of an investment you're making when you can't accurately predict the value of money in 5 years? You can't, and that's why that sort of chaos is terrible for a currency.

--Its inflation/deflation rate can't be regulated. For all people like to shit on the Federal Reserve, it's generally pretty great at keeping the USD inflation rate at a reasonable level. Same goes for the national banks of _most_ governments. But bitcoin and most other cryptocurrencies can't be regulated in the same way by anyone, whether government or private. Yet another reason investors never prefer Bitcoin to USD.

--It can't be used to buy goods and services in most places. This is the most fundamental aspect that makes money money, and yet outside of some online vendors it's quite rare for businesses to accept Bitcoin. That probably isn't going to change unless businesses regarded bitcoin in the same way they do cash or credit, and Bitcoin's fundamental problems for investors as described above largely make that a pipe dream.

Blockchain is pretty cool and I wouldn't be surprised if it is integrated into national currencies, but Cryptocurrencies will never replace fiat money.

"Thanks, I guess? I simplified it a bit for brevity but I stand by my conclusions. To my knowledge, none of the cryptocurrencies is explicitly deflationary. Bitcoin has a disinflationary emission curve, approaching 0.

Under a disinflationary currency where emission ultimately reaches 0, house prices might still fluctuate on the basis of supply and demand but on average house prices would be stable. This would remove the incentive for speculation and allow prices to find an equilibrium that is actually based on utility. If you wonder what would happen to people trying to take out a mortgage: they would probably pay significantly less for their house with speculation removed from the price. The interest rate could either be higher because of higher risks for the lender in a full reserve system, or they could be lower because interest rates do not have to make up for inflation anymore.

All in all, mortgage lending will probably decrease substantially because saving will be much more worthwhile. Currently, saving is penalized and borrowing is promoted. This illogical situation will end.

In the US it is considered normal to borrow to buy a car. This is not considered normal in all countries. A similar thing could happen for housing. In fact, mortgages weren't all that prevalent in the past either. It used to be frowned upon to have a mortgage on your house.

You claim that currency needs to depreciate for it to function and that people are able to escape this penalty by investing their money elsewhere. I would argue that this situation promotes inequality. Those who earn wages or pensions see their purchasing power erode. Only those with capital are able to escape this penalty. And even then: those in the know about investments benefit at the expense of the rest. Also, the penalty ends up in the coffers of banks. This is no way to run a fair financial system. Also, gold was used for thousands of years which shows that depreciation is not necessary either.

Edit: the conventional wisdom that inflation is beneficial has been actively promoted by those who benefit from it.   This in itself is not an argument against inflation, but it should urge anyone to at least perform their own independent thinking to reach an independent conclusion.

Edit 2: also, the type of deflation you mention (where people lose their jobs and it spirals out of control) is caused by a credit crunch. Such a credit crunch is much less likely to happen in a full reserve system because money is not destroyed when credit tightens. Dropping prices in absence of a credit crunch are fine: they are a natural occurrence in an economy where productivity continuously increases.
