When a user creates a wallet in this case in blockchain, it is the same system that chooses the words that will be the seed to retrieve the private key, the user does not choose the words, so the system may place some found in the whitepaper but you can also place several that are not inside the WP, so you must also take into account the words that are not related to the document.

Hi. I was restoring access to the wallet using a mnemonic seed of 12 words on Blockchain.info All 12 words are taken from the puzzle and each word has a logical justification. Chance is completely excluded. Mnemonic seed is created by the blockchain system and is associated with all addresses of your wallet and cannot be changed. When you restore access to the wallet using mnemonic seed, the system creates a new wallet and transfers all transactions and addresses from the old wallet to it. It is impossible to create a new wallet from invented words. Who's not sure can try.....:- ) When I got access to the puzzle balance wallet = 0 BTC and no transactions. I look forward to hearing from cryptogreetings to clarify this.;-1;1;False;Dimitry2020;e0dwxob;1 BTC is hidden in this puzzle. Good luck!;8kk0pa;https://i.redd.it/g4rbvtbiwry01.png

It would be great if you could clarify something about the clues. I do believe the community is confused. The change in prize address with the -1 clue conflicts with the +1. Yet you said ""it won't affect your progress"" and all clues still valid.

 Are the +1 -1 related or separate clues?
 Are both +1 and -1 valid clues?
 Are all clues in picture still valid or does the -1 negate the picture clues?

 And can this be solved using ian colemans bip39 online tool? ( I understand if you can't answer this one.)

Lets take this metaphor further. Lets say you are gonna make 50$ for digging this ditch. You pay your employees 20$. You are creating a profit of 30$. 

Your workers cant do shit. You have all the power over them. They can quit, but unless they can afford to be without a job or are able to find a new job they cant quit. You are abusing their labor to create a 30$ for yourself. We should give the workers the power to negotiate for better pay/conditions instead of letting the ones in power decide it all.

"Ahhhh, the old ""my grandfather killed more people than your grandfather"" get ~~out of jail~~ into paradise free card ;)

There's an [interesting Wikipedia article] (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monogamy) all about that.

>Betzig postulated that culture/society can also be a source of social monogamy by enforcing it through rules and laws set by third-party actors, usually in order to protect the wealth or power of the elite.

>For example, Augustus Caesar encouraged marriage and reproduction to force the aristocracy to divide their wealth and power among multiple heirs, but the aristocrats kept their socially monogamous, legitimate children to a minimum to ensure their legacy while having many extra-pair copulations.

>Similarly—according to Betzig—the Christian Church enforced monogamy because wealth passed to the closest living, legitimate male relative, often resulting in the wealthy oldest brother being without a male heir.

>Thus, the wealth and power of the family would pass to the “celibate” younger brother of the church. In both of these instances, the rule-making elite used cultural processes to ensure greater reproductive fitness for themselves and their offspring, leading to a larger genetic influence in future generations.

Problem is, you do that over enough successive generations and the in-group end up losing their cognitive edge due to the lack of genetic (and intellectual) diversity...  and the underclass, enriched through the novelty of experience and their exposure and mixing with a greater range of people, art, culture and ideas end up wondering why they're letting the (now ill educated and homogenised) elites tell them how the world works.

It is independent of the government to remove potential political conflicts of interests but exists only to stabilise the American economy.

"""wow, this really demonstrates a fundamental problem with capitalism and that the working class is being exploited by wealthy property owners.""

Nobody said so, because it isn't true. Capitalism is not a game as you might see it as. Capitalism is a natural system because it is voluntary an based on the free exchange of property which is a natural concept observable in many species of animal. Statism is the opposite. Based on the forced exchange of property (e.i. theft) the state is violence and not natural.
