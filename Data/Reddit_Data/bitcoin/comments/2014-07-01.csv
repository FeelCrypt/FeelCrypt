"Couple years ago, she got a cataract surgery.  Couple days later, she was supposed to go back in surgery to have lenses installed in her eyes.  However, she never went.  For this reason, she was almost blind.

In May, she decided to go outside again and got hit by a taxi in her own parking lot.  Keep in mind that she's 4 feet 10 inches tall... apparently the taxi driver just didn't see her.  She broke her tibia and apparently she won't be able to walk as good as before.

"That's not a great explanation.  I think what you mean to say is that merchants immediately cashing out to USD will put downward pressure on the price because they are selling it instead of holding it, but you didn't explain that.  ""Because of momentum"" literally means nothing. :P

But I don't really buy it.  Sure, on the short term, for maybe like a few thousand dollars, but that's a drop in the bucket.  If people are spending, it's because they're acquiring it by buying it.  The price could only continue to fall specifically as a result of merchant spending if it was the same hardcore bitcoin users just continually releasing their coins into the market.  But that's not what's happening.  New users are buying and making up the difference.  And what's spent on merchants is just a fraction of any daily sell volume anyway.

Perhaps, it's possible you may earn credits for reviews, ect.

"The price we pay for the protection you describe costs everyone billions each year. All of those protections are necessary only because the payment and banking systems are badly broken.

Right now securing bitcoin demands some technical understanding, but once they're properly secure the chance someone will steal your coins is lower than any other bad thing that could ever happen to you. Getting stuck by lightning, drowning in a desert, take your pick.

This requirement for technical skills will disappear. 20 years ago the internet was very challenging to use. Now a 3 year old can do it. This time around it won't take 20 years because much of the hard work was done in the last 20 years.

"> The dream here then, would be to use a credit card to make all online purchases

Not really.  You're on the right track; buyer and seller protection are valuable, and do cost money to implement.

What we need isn't credit cards, though.  We need escrow and mediation services that can perform the function of chargebacks, etc. and we need competition in this space.

The market seems ripe for innovation.  Paypal's chargeback and mediation process is easy for buyers to game and is biased by their own fee incentivization.  They cater to buyers because, in the end, they make more money that way.  A service dedicated just to escrow and mediation could have an elaborate rating/counter-rating system, clever fraud detection, etc.  They could work with shipping services, for example, to confirm delivery (confirm package delivered, recipient can decide if they require a signature, etc.).  There's a huge potential here, and the best part is that barriers to entry are low.  It's pretty easy to set up a bitcoin escrow service, and there are lots of smaller specialized markets that allow for new entrants to gain a foothold.  A small fraud-prone community (trading cards, collectables, antiques, etc.) will actively seek out better options and start using them.

You ignore the apostrophe for ""it"" when it's possessive. For instance, mostly you'd say ""Mark's pride"", never ""Marks pride"". However with ""it"" you say ""its pride"" and never ""it's pride"".

However, when it's a contraction, such as ""Mark is an idiot"" to ""Mark's an idiot"", then the special rule for ""it"" doesn't apply: ""it is stupid"" is valid, as is ""it's stupid.""

But as time goes on and (hopefully) bitcoin becomes more widespread, we may see companies begin to compete with each other for bitcoin sales because there will be significant cost savings and possibly far less volatility.  It's also likely that some payment processors that companies like Newegg already use will start to use bitcoin behind the scenes.

"Some screenshots of the entire flow:

1. When you get to the billing screen: http://i.imgur.com/uyikRgP.png
2. Selecting Bitcoin: http://i.imgur.com/9AsEeyL.png
3. Then you have to click the ""Bitcoin ^checkout ^now"" logo to checkout: http://i.imgur.com/Rj5SZeo.png 
4. Bitpay embed: http://i.imgur.com/7GZLKyH.png


IMO step 3 is confusing. It looks like the badge that most places use to simply advertise that they accept BTC (like they do in the previous step!). I didn't think to click it at first and didn't see where to click to checkout. It took a few moments for it to hit me.

Very happy to see them do this! The checkout flow is a bit confusing but I bet they optimize it - a company so large invests lots of time into tweaking funnels like checkout.

Also worth noting that selecting BTC takes no extra steps on the second screen, whereas with a card you have to enter in all your details. However for BTC there is that Bitpay screen at the end while a credit card would just be silently charged in the background. Very different process for creating a transaction.

Newegg just seem ridiculously overpriced.. and that's before I even add shipping.

Why do people buy from them?

Not sure why the downvotes. People don't believe me, or is anything not super-positive simply downvoted around here??)

I was just surprised and trying to understand why their AUS store has significantly higher prices even before applying shipping. It's not that I get things particularly cheap here in Australia.

"The only difference is the method (and security) of the transaction.

Credit Cards are ""pull"" transactions in which the merchant has *full* access to your account and (by the grace of their honesty) only ""pulls"" out the amount you agreed upon (here's hoping they're a reputable merchant!)

Bitcoin (and cash) are ""push"" transactions in which you as a consumer ""push"" the proper amount from your account to theirs, meaning the merchant only has access to the amount agreed upon and nothing more. 

Personally, I've had my credit card info stolen more than once and since it is a ""pull"" system the fraudsters were able to empty my account.
