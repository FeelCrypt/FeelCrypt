"If you're going to nitpick over such technical minutia, then I don't see what type of meaningful debate you expect to have. Yes, but your strict definition, there have been no governments ever, as no government operates exactly as laid out in some academic textbook. You're trying to hide in the weeds to avoid the more general point that socialism is a very flawed ideology.

And yes, I'm using informal definitions because this is Reddit, not an academic symposium on the evils of socialism. The bottom line is that socialism, in general, values government control vastly over individual rights, and that historically, governments tend to be run by incompetent people at best, or evil people at worst. Therefore it's foolish to introduce socialist policies into government as the capability for government to cause harm increases.";1;0;False;GrabAHamLincoln;dpi1773;Lily Allen turned down 200K in Bitcoins for a gig in 2009 which is worth $1,426,199,000 as of this writing;7aq0fx;https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/lily-allen-calls-herself-an-idiot-for-declining-bitcoin-payment-now-worth-millions-9046211.html

LOL working hard is the equivalent to greed now? So Elon Musk is greedy that's why he's doing all the work he's doing, and Jeff Bezos he's greedy as well? So you complain that you don't get enough money, enough benefits, enough retirement from a company, well why do you need that money? Isn't that your greed? I have seen plenty of people live off of next to nothing, but you are so greedy you work at a corporation to make that big paycheck so you can get the retirement benefits to not have to work anymore...so to quote you I would say it's your own damn fault you are working at a corporation.  Make money elsewhere, you don't have to work for a corporation, you can start your own business, you can work for a ma and pa company, you can live on welfare, you can live in the woods, the only reason you're at a corporation is your consumption habits and your greed that you want to retire and be able to pay your mortgage, car, golf, or not work for 35+ years of retirement, but somehow you want others to sacrifice and pay you more so you can selfishly do what you want earlier.  I feel sorry for you and your view of the world and the people in it, your only care seems to be your own agenda and getting you further on the backs or dimes of others...you sound like those CEOs/people you despise.;1;0;False;JesC929;dpj9o52;My BTC, which I've held for only 3 years, are today officially worth more than my 10+ years of investing into my 401(k).;7axesn;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7axesn/my_btc_which_ive_held_for_only_3_years_are_today/

Don't know what hextracoin is?  Google it, check out their Facebook, and read all you can.  They went from $1 at ICO to $19 four minutes after the exchange opened on their internal page.  Similarities between it and Ucoin cash are there and I'm taking full advantage of it.  Ucoin cash has great white pages, a respectable site and servers, and a lot of volume on both social media and members making accounts on the site.  I highly recommend checking it out and singing up.  Here is my referral link: https://ucoincash.co/ref/norkchop10  sign up and watch the first day of ICO November 15th.  Any other opinions?

">The Segwit2x effort began in May with a simple purpose: to increase the blocksize and improve Bitcoin scalability. At the time, the Bitcoin community was in crisis after nearly 3 years of heavy debate, and consensus for Segwit seemed like a distant mirage with only 30% support among miners. Segwit2x found its first success in August, as it broke the deadlock and quickly led to Segwit’s successful activation. Since that time, the team shifted its efforts to phase two of the project - a 2MB blocksize increase.
>
>Our goal has always been a smooth upgrade for Bitcoin. Although we strongly believe in the need for a larger blocksize, there is something we believe is even more important: keeping the community together. Unfortunately, it is clear that we have not built sufficient consensus for a clean blocksize upgrade at this time. Continuing on the current path could divide the community and be a setback to Bitcoin’s growth. This was never the goal of Segwit2x.
>
>As fees rise on the blockchain, we believe it will eventually become obvious that on-chain capacity increases are necessary. When that happens, we hope the community will come together and find a solution, possibly with a blocksize increase. Until then, we are suspending our plans for the upcoming 2MB upgrade.
>
>We want to thank everyone that contributed constructively to Segwit2x, whether you were in favor or against. Your efforts are what makes Bitcoin great. Bitcoin remains the greatest form of money mankind has ever seen, and we remain dedicated to protecting and fostering its growth worldwide.

This new thing people were more afraid of because it was viewed more as a hostile takeover of BTC, which is why people were glad this was cancelled.

You can have a difference of opinion as a layman based on intutions, but when the intellectual majority keeps telling you that a design choice has problems, one needs to take pause. 

Additionally, there is the issue of conspiracy theories (on both sides). This issue is a harder problem to solve because I guarantee that there are and will be factions in this world who want to disrupt Bitcoin. They may be corporations, governments, altcoiners, hackers, criminal organizations, etc. So the theories have at least a nugget of plausibility.

"**Technical analysis**

In finance, technical analysis is an analysis methodology for forecasting the direction of prices through the study of past market data, primarily price and volume. Behavioral economics and quantitative analysis use many of the same tools of technical analysis, which, being an aspect of active management, stands in contradiction to much of modern portfolio theory. The efficacy of both technical and fundamental analysis is disputed by the efficient-market hypothesis which states that stock market prices are essentially unpredictable.

Who next?

Honestly, it's a bit disappointing that none of these actually got to the point of a miner-backed attack, since they would've lost, and that would've once-and-for-all put an end to the ""miners control Bitcoin"" narrative. Oh well.

If you want growth at any cost, go to ETH or Bcash or whatever. Bitcoin is for stability: a money that will last decades, maybe even centuries, not a plan to take over the world ASAP and make us all fabulously wealthy. Some bigblockers honestly think that in order for Bitcoin to achieve its end objectives, it's necessary for it to spread everywhere ASAP before it can be crushed: if you believe that, then you will find it much easier to adopt or create a different cryptocurrency and *out-compete* Bitcoin, since we Bitcoin true believers will fight you every step of the way if you instead try to hijack Bitcoin. I've seen quite a few bigblockers act as though I'm totally opposed to Bcash, but really I don't mind it; stop trying to hijack *Bitcoin* and I don't care what you do.

A lot of companies showed their true colors here. Some stuck their necks out in the right direction and deserve recognition. And some were clearly working against Bitcoin, to varying degrees. We should make a comprehensive list at some point.

This is great news, and represents the community coming together and not splitting more. It also represents bitcoin being resistant to attacks from those that wish to impose changes without the consent of the economic majority of users.

Some may be disappointed that they won't be getting their B2X coins but consider all the market uncertainty holding bitcoin price back and now how we can really grow together as a united community. I expect a very bullish future for bitcoin.

I just want to say that anyone who is on Jihan's side is against Bitcoin.

Anyone that Jihan **sides** ***with*** but doesn't consider themselves on Jihan's side needs to take a serious look in the mirror and reevaluate their ideas, intentions, and motives.

Moving into the future it's important to remember these people because this won't be the last attempt to fork the network. **You don't go and create Bitcoin Cash and then claim you have Bitcoin's best interest at heart.**

You don't promote or associate with anyone who does this.

These people who signed this withdrawal did.

No matter your view on these people, no matter how many strikes you have already assigned them, no matter how many times you gave them the benefit of the doubt in the past, they should be on their final strike right now, if they haven't already struck out in your eyes.

You can look at this as a ""coming together moment"" all you want, but all I see is a group of people folding realizing their efforts weren't going to pay off well for them.

If you still want to extend that benefit of the doubt I employ you to look back at this moment if they ever involve themselves in such tactics again and not extend them that benefit next time.";42;4;False;StopAndDecrypt;dpj4lv5;SegWit2X Cancelled?;7bmpnn;https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-segwit2x/2017-November/000685.html

It's simple :

* BCH (no segwit) is worth 0.08 BTC

* 2x never got implemented

"Because it is. No single pattern can ever be long term profitable without heavy laws or other obstructions to trade, because every rational trader will update their own economic modeling after it in their trade, and thus increasing arbitrage and removing the margin between demand and supply. Profits in trading only come from arbitrage, built on such margins. Finding something below expected market value. If the entire market knows the expected value, nothing will ever be sold under market value (with few exceptions), eliminating the possibility to profit off arbitrage.

So in less words, as soon as a pattern is found profitable it will stop being profitable when the market learns about it. The majority of perceived patterns are just mirages.";5;1;False;Natanael_L;dpjjq4c;SegWit2X Cancelled?;7bmpnn;https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-segwit2x/2017-November/000685.html

"Gold as a commodity is not replaceable in the real world. You know what I meant. We use gold for industrial purposes. It’s used in electronics. It’s used in jewelry. That’s ultimately what it’s value comes from. 

Gold has not been backed a currency in many decades. Not talking about it as a currency. 

Currencies come and go. Real commodities tend to stick around. 

In the digital world, you can come up with a better commodity-based blockchain that could eventually eclipse bitcoin. Many believe we will. 

If that were to happen, bitcoin would become an altcoin and thus eventually die a (very slow) death as people move to the new winner.

So yes. Bitcoin as a currency and store of value can be replaced. Gold (which is not a currency or a backing any serious one at this point) cannot be replaced as a commodity (where it gets its real value).

"Gold isn't any more stable than any other financial instrument, in fact it's been less stable.

Here is a chart - https://www.tradingview.com/x/3uJONgxz/

"Dude. Come on. Don't be so obtuse. 

> I'm saying no investment reliably does 50% in 3 months is my point.

No shit. I never said anything in the contrary. Why make that point? What does that have to do with anything? I agree with that statement! I already said:  

> But I'm still up 58% on bitcoin right now, in 3 months. That's more than I made on gold in 3 years, so I'm happy. **That's a lot compared to most investments.**

Your original question:

> If you want to gamble, isn't it better to try and find the next bitcoin rather than to get in on the tail end of something?

So I answered: I would rather have excellent returns on Bitcoin than buy altcoins. I view altcoin investors as people buyinglottery tickets. I don't know where you're from, but in the US a lottery ticket analogy means gambling at insane odds to win insane amount of money. You replied:

> 50% in 3 months is a lottery ticket in investment terms.

Which totally misses my point and my analogy. 50% returns is not a lottery ticket. 1,000,000,000% returns is a lottery ticket where I'm from. (example, $5 can win you $50 million)

In fact, you agree with me, but you're so focused on stupid details and arguing about dumb shit that you can't even see it. You're so far off track your in the parking lot yelling at a car.

I said I prefer bitcoin because it has great returns: better returns than a hedge fund and the S & P 500. 

Altcoins = spending your money on lottery tickets. Tiny chance to make insane profits. I'm not seeking insane profits. Again, let me quantify what I mean by insane profits so you don't argue that %50 in 3 months *is* insane profits. I'm talking about buying thousands of bitcoins for cents on the dollar. I'm not trying to recreate that by chasing bitcoin.

> If you think 50% in 3 months is a realistically achievable figure you should be running a hedge fund. Else its luck of buying in at the right time.

Where did I say that? What are you acting like I said that? Why aren't you talking about altcoins versus bitcoin and the question you asked me? Why are you so confused by my lottery ticket analogy? Why are you stuck on my gold analogy? Who cares if gold is a shitty store of value or it's great in jewelry? This has nothing to do with my larger answer to your question. 

If you think altcoins are worth investing in, then tell me about that. But instead you start arguing with me that 50% returns is like winning a lottery ticket and all this bull shit that misses the entire point completely. I wanted to have an insightful conversation with you but your head is just too far up your ass. I've got to block you. You're just insufferable. You sound smart, but you really have to learn open your point of view a bit more. Your points aren't even wrong, they're just super off target. You're right about your facts, but it's like, why are you saying these things? Why can't he stay on topic? Does he just want to be right? Even if it's for stupid things that I'm not talking about?

These two comments directly contradict each other.

Either you think bitcoin can keep seeing the returns higher than any other investment, or you don't.

In fact in a previous post you said you expect it to do 5-10% long term. Which means the S&P just does as well, as bitcoin, except its done that well for the last 90 years.

The difference the S&P is heavily diversified across 500 of the largest companies.

"It's a massive fallacy to believe that gold has some crazy industrial consumption driving its value. Less than 12% of all gold produced is used for industrial purposes, and that amount decreases daily. 9 of those 12% are actually for dentistry believe it or not, for fillings, mostly for cosmetic reasons. 

50% is used for jewelry, but it's not like other materials don't have as good or superior jewelry making properties anymore. The reason gold is used in jewelry is because it is expensive and it's a show of wealth. And gold is used in trace values, if at all in electronics anymore. We don't live in a digital age where signal quality is a serious issue anymore. The entire reason gold is worth 3x what it cost to produce is for speculative purposes, particularly as an inflation hedge. In fact 35% of all gold produced is used for the dedicated purpose of investment/speculation, and 90+% of that is in an ETF. So if bitcoin usurps gold in its store of value properties (and all that would take is for the world to recognize it as a universal symbol of value that not everyone will just sell off tomorrow), then there's absolutely no reason why bitcoin wouldn't also usurp a significant portion of gold's investment market, dropping the price of gold, which also drops its reason to be used in show of wealth jewelry and you get a feedback loop. 

And again, you don't get to just point to a nonexistent replacement and say it *will* happen. Is it possible to happen? Sure. But I believe it is highly unlikely, because its replacement would also need to be open access, permission-less, and open source, while overcoming the bootstrapping issue that all cryptocurrencies must overcome, all without bitcoin just deciding to steal its open source code if things got close enough. Bitcoin the asset is a network state. How we decide to change that state is the protocol, which is the technology, and that can and does change all the time. But like I said, if bitcoin becomes a universally understood symbol of value (well on its way), you aren't going to convince people to simply abandon that network state and any wealth they have stored in it overnight for 2.0. The switch from MySpace to Facebook required very little sacrifice from the end user. Switching the very fundamental value structure of your life is a substantial change that many will simply not do. I believe bitcoin will always have competition, but so does the USD and it seems to be doing just fine in relation to its competition.

Like always, the economy tends to grow and contract. A recession, while a basic part of cycles in economics, is still sure to cause some unfortunate effects, and I believe the next one (which I think we will begin to effects of in the next 1-2 years, maybe 3), will be particularly bad. 

Clearly this is all speculation on my end but it's what I believe. What is harder to know though, is what effects this will have on everything, including crypto.

"no, im saying gold is far far below where it should have been. Mining, recycling, and loss of currency status have decayed its value. Its now a terrible investment. Not as bad as silver or dollars, but very bad.
 
If gold had kept par value for the last 100 years, and there was zero economic growth, then gold should be worth be 6500 per ounce. However there has been insane economic growth yet gold has dropped down to 1/6th of par value. 

If you think gold is good as an investmetn, then you think losing over 5/6ths of its value over 100 years is good,

"**Imaginary number**

An imaginary number is a complex number that can be written as a real number multiplied by the imaginary unit i, which is defined by its property i2 = −1. The square of an imaginary number bi is −b2. For example, 5i is an imaginary number, and its square is −25. Zero is considered to be both real and imaginary.

"I think we are talking past each other and not actually disagreeing.

I believe the majority of gold's value comes from speculation, and that its a fallacy to believe it's industrial demand gives it some ""intrinsic value"" any more than bitcoin. I believe that its inflation hedge days are coming to an end as bitcoin offers everything it can, and more, and I don't believe the dental/electronics/jewelry industry can consume enough of the supply to keep the price where it is.

In other words, I'm very bullish with bitcoin, and very bearish with gold as purely inflationary hedges over the next decade.

But I also don't believe you can just point to ""bitcoin 2.0"" if it doesn't actually exist, saying that it exists.

">you don’t actually have to store the gold yourself

You don't have to for bitcoin either. Get a coinbase account and let them store it for you if you're lazy. 

You don't *have* to take delivery of either of these assets, but if you choose to, it's far easier to take delivery of bitcoin.

"**Artificial scarcity**

Artificial scarcity describes the scarcity of items even though either the technology and production, or sharing capacity exists to create a theoretically limitless abundance, as well as the use of laws to create scarcity where otherwise there wouldn't be. The most common causes are monopoly pricing structures, such as those enabled by laws that restrict competition or by high fixed costs in a particular marketplace. The inefficiency associated with artificial scarcity is formally known as a deadweight loss.

That's actually a problem, not a feature.

I have something, a pretty certificate on thick paper, with solid sounding words and a rubber stamp on it that says I own gold. And that's all I really have; a pretty piece of paper that looks very important. I have to trust it.

And, even worse, perhaps someone else has one exactly the same.

"Technology allowed us to create artificial gold. It can allow us to create a better mouse trap.

Not saying it’ll happen soon, but a a LOT can happen in this space in a short amount of time. Ethereum was a tiny blip 24 months ago. It actually made a serious go at taking the king position against BTC. It failed for a variety of reasons, but it’s not to say that people could come up with a smarter system, that’s more secure than bitcoin.

- Nvidia and AMD are working on mining hardware. 
- Dash and other coins like it have been trying two tier systems to avoid mining centralization of power.

There are definite efforts to beat bitcoin at its own game.
