I agree.

Untrue; you can extrapolate a 2% inflation rate just as easily as a 0% inflation rate.

A log scale is intended. A log scale is more meaningful than a level scale in this case.";3;1;False;Integralds;dlc1xo2;Just a quick reminder why Bitcoin was invented in the first place.

"Integralds, your chart doesn't show more stable. It shows more consistency but not stability. Over time prices are going up where as before prices were ping-ponging between a mean price, sometimes over sometimes under. 

Long term you could expect the price in the past to be somewhere around where it was today (assuming not war or gold rush caused massive inflation/deflation). I have no clue where prices will end up by the time I retire; which means I can't plan for it by ""just saving"" and have to take riskier moves to ensure my returns match inflation. 

Maybe theres some definition of economically or monetarily stable that says forever increasing price is stability. And if so I apologize. However, using a colloquial understanding of stable, the US dollar has not been stable.

Small nitpick; Your first chart is logarithmic in scale. This over-emphasizes changes at the bottom of the scale and ""smooths out"" newer changes. I know it's not a massive thing (as things like inflation associated with the War of 1812 is always going to look ""bad""), but it is slightly misleading.";1;1;False;chalbersma;dlc0zfg;Just a quick reminder why Bitcoin was invented in the first place.

Enough people in power understand it. The argument is that bankers provide a valuable service working as middlemen to manage the supply of the commodity we call money. However, bankers often abuse that position and earn unreasonable sums and resist replacement. The point of blockchain and crypto is to make all those middlemen obsolete. It can't come soon enough.;1;0;False;;dlb8bq5;Just a quick reminder why Bitcoin was invented in the first place. This used to be preaching to the choir.

"[Price level, US, 1750-2015.](http://i.imgur.com/oAZXCLF.png) 
The price level from 1750 to 1900, and even through 1950, showed variation over time but little upward trend. The key number from 1750 to 1950 is 4: prices varied by a factor of four, typically rising during wars and falling afterwards. Medium-term trends in the overall price level were driven by the supply and demand for precious metals.  

[Price inflation, US, 1750-2015.](http://i.imgur.com/u7eiTNR.png) Notice that inflation was volatile pre-1950 and relatively smooth afterwards.

"""This leads to a yearly increase in prices. The price increase is somewhat lower than the increase in the money supply. This is because of increased productivity. Society gets better at producing stuff cheaper all the time. So, in absence of money creation you would expect prices to drop every year. That they donâ€™t is the effect of money creation.
What remains is an inflation rate in the 2% range.
Banks have discovered that they can siphon off all the productivity increase + 2% every year, without people complaining too much. They accomplish this currently by increasing the money supply by 5% per year, getting this money returned to them at an interest.""
