"It should be judged by its technology, its forward looking innovations and the practicality of it achieving its stated purpose.

""Hodlers"" are a virus upon the ecosystem. Often by definition, hippocrates. With one sentence they condemn the current financial institution, and the woes which plague it: disproportionately distributed wealth leading to massive class gaps, the failure of the Reaganomic platform due to hoarding of wealth by the top 1-2% and vast pay gaps. Spit in the faces of the Reserve Banks and deficit spending- without understanding that the purpose of those systems is to ensure growth in an economy, by stimulating spending and creating the accumulation of debt, which in turn drives motivation (or at minimum a need) to work. Work builds infrastructure, creates export which we hope to trade with others and gives our new notes value. A desire to escape the mundane of a life living off unskilled labor leads to motivation for innovation- the more we innovate, the more we can lay down our picks and axes and hand them to our partners in trade who lack the creativity we express as a population.

Is the system perfect? Far from it. It is incredibly flawed. But bitcoin (nor any digital currency) was not the first attempt at a free economy either- there have been many and all have failed within a couple decades.

Look at the Free Banking system in the US in the 1860s, it bares striking resemblance to the cryptocurrency revolution. It's ultimate demise was the unregulated and extreme proliferation of new currencies, each taking small value from one another, poor arbitrage between non-liquid free markets, difficulty of obtaining or setting a single medium of exchange and a lack of backing other than by the power and resources vested in the minting agents themselves.

Back to ""hodlers,"" what is it that you are doing that will eventually lead to demise of the coin? You are hindering innovation, decreasing liquid currency supply, and attempting to profit off the pyramid of difficulty ladders and reward halvings, so that you might get rich without effort nor innovation.

But you see, what you are creating is not a currency, but a collector's item: no different than baseball cards. Correct in your statement that the more who refuse to sell, the higher goes the price- but that creates a system where the developers, arguably those with the greatest stake in the coin, need not innovate, but simply watch their reserves grow in paper value. Absent this unnatural growth caused by nothing more than the ""collector's phenomenon,"" the holders of the coin would need to find a different pathway to increase its worth- a pathway involving ingenuity, innovation and improvement. But, inherently lazy, without that motivation driven by a lust for more, not present artificiality, innovation slows to but a mere trickle.

The rest is fairly obvious. If you believe in a true, free currency for all, then it is up to you to contribute. Contribute to the network by mining (even if it's a break even game), or running a full node. More importantly, contribute to the economy by spending, **not hodling.** 

Don't think this is geared toward the entire audience of this sub. I see a fairly even split among those who understand the concept and are true supporters, and those who would be better off trading baseball cards for what it's worth.

I implore and encourage any intelligent, well thought out counterargument in rebuttal to my theories laid forth here. I'll take the usual accusations of being some sort of paid employee for the evil block corporations or misdirected insults as further validation to my point.";1;1;False;Nycmdthroaway;eelvxa7;Judge bitcoin by yearly lows, not all time highs.;abznev;https://i.redd.it/3n7l1vlmp3821.jpg
