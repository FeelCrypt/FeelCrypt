"**Forth (programming language)**

Forth is an imperative stack-based computer programming language and environment originally designed by Charles ""Chuck"" Moore. Language features include structured programming, reflection (the ability to modify the program structure during program execution), concatenative programming (functions are composed with juxtaposition) and extensibility (the programmer can create new commands). Although not an acronym, the language's name is sometimes spelled with all capital letters as FORTH, following the customary usage during its earlier years.

A procedural programming language without type checking, Forth features both interactive execution of commands (making it suitable as a shell for systems that lack a more formal operating system) and the ability to compile sequences of commands for later execution.

"**Firth of Forth**

The Firth of Forth (Scottish Gaelic: Linne Foirthe) is the estuary (firth) of several Scottish rivers including the River Forth. It meets the North Sea with Fife on the north coast and Lothian on the south. It was known as Bodotria in Roman times. In the Norse sagas it was known as the Myrkvifiörd.

"> There are already many decentralized communities on the internet. They work great.

How many people use them? Provide a link.

This reddit has 800k *subscribers* plus a very large group of would-be spammers and scammers. You can link to some small community that's succeeding all you like, but a success story requires seeing what happens when the community is attacked in full-force. That, by that way, is what the rules are for. You ban and remove the attackers by force. Required to keep the community working. Just as bitcoin rejects invalid transactions. A community that doesn't enforce rules is simply not able to survive at scale.

So, yeah, we are talking about millions of people here. That's the size of this community and if you're advocating that it could work as a decentralized community, despite ignoring my explanation of why I disagree on technological grounds, then the burden of proof is on you.

You *did* read [the now-famous article](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/tscc3e5eujrsEeFN4/well-kept-gardens-die-by-pacifism) linked to earlier on, right? You understand that this isn't just some random idea I'm making up?

The requirement of moderation, or call it ""censorship"" if you will, is why decentralization is difficult. Unlike bitcoin, the content isn't simple inputs and outputs of numbers that must add up. The rules of a forum for discussion are too complex to represent by algorithm, so you need people enforcing them. People who need to be chosen somehow. How do you propose they be chosen? When you have an answer, ask if it can be subject to a Sybil attack. It almost certainly can be, easily. 

This could all change, perhaps, with further improvements in AI research. You could put a computer in charge of removing spam and scam posts, but with current technology you will get false positives.

">$300 million has been stolen so far. 

That is a complete fabrication. No amount has ever been stolen from any blockchain that was not under a 51% attack.

Most of the rest are non sequiturs that are already answered (reread the post to which you replied) but for the sake of completeness. I'll answer one and therefore many/most others.

>Who wrote the code for your wallet? Did you? 

Yes! Do you know how software works? If it's open source I've effectively written the code for anything that I'm using. I can change it, I can audit it, I can scrutinise it, it's all there.

So I don't trust anyone but myself, that's the point of using a trustless system.

And if it os end to end. Then exchanges should be open source / decentralised as well...

You're being purposefully obtuse. I'm telling you how the tech works and you pretend that you do not understand or understood something completely different.

The technology is end to end, which includes the use of 3rd parties, if you so want to. But if you get goxxed it's all on you. I mean my car is safe on low speed collisions, if I get into a low speed collision all the while I'm setting it on fire then I'm going to die a horrible death.

It is possible, although extremely unlikely. But if bitcoin actually succeeded at becoming a world reserve currency I don't think it would be that far fetched. So much of it would be hoarded and so much of it lost permanently. Who knows what will happen in the future, be ready for any outcome. I use about 10 faucets at a time while I'm at work and just collect from them every hour, it is literally no sweat off my back at all.
