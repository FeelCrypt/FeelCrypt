"You know what bothers me about every victim on here is the fact about my personal experience with bittrex, their customer service has always been stellar. It’s really been me when I’ve had to re enable my accounts so my photos and the tons of documents they need ( which is a GREAT thing, however tedious you guys may complain). Took like two seconds in theory. 

What I’ve tried to explain is there are much smarter people than any of us who are actively trying to figure out how to steal everyone’s crypto currency everyday. It’s still very early in this game. Very early. And bitcoin will hit over 6 figures a coin within 5 years and who the hell even knows how high from there. 

But my point is...slowly as the richest people begin to have their lightbulbs go off and see crypto is the future of money period... many innocent and or lucky investors who either don’t truly understand crypto yet... they don’t protect themselves etc .. and don’t  get who how or why hacks are so prevalent and will be much more before it even starts getting better .. basically the retail/ coinbase investors... these people will probably lose their coins somehow. Or will be hapless victims of some sort. Which is why education and just thorough understanding of everything bitcoin is essential to still having these coins when they do create many many more millionaires in the next decade etc. 
-Others will not be proactive enough and have some warm wallets compromised.. because they don’t understand the people like myself and many others on here who are bitcoin lifers who truly understand we’re still witnessing bitcoins infancy... we’re in early stages and the hacks or accusations people are making now against certain wallets exchanges etc are going to look like the good ole days in a few years. 
Shit will get crazy. The only real real way to do this correctly and stop theorizing and wasting time with these threads because they can and will all be compromised or have at some point in some way.. you need a piece of paper. A pencil. And a written down key.. period. Make 2 pencil copies and bury one in back yard if you have to and buy a damn safe. A real safe. One that’s bolted to ground. Only sure fire way to protect yourself. To protect yourself in a few years from any entity to even know you own these etc. 

Anyone who made it  his far down on this thread and read my comment. Please take this as seriously as you had to protect your moms house because groups of the best burglars in the world were trying to find a way to open a window every single damn day. Period. It is what it is. I think the reward is definitely worth it. But we need to support and help each other like this and really defend our community. Good luck.

"You’re absolutely NEVER using bittrex based on this story which other redditors with clear crypto knowledge have poked more holes in than a honeycomb. That’s not logical or bright. And pretty ignorant and naive imo. Do your own research. Lol. It’s only the google of crypto and what I’ve found is more times than not it’s a user error or mistake that is NOT on bittrex and them disabling the account is a phenomenal thing because they are trying to protect their other users. Like myself and etc and if you guys send off ANY flags.. I don’t give a shit if you have 1 million USD in BTC I want them flagging your accounts for however long it takes. Period. 

This is a GOOD thing. I love bittrex because they can be the most tedious to get in and out of but that’s probably the single most important part of their business model. You think hackers are bombarding them hundreds of times everyDAY trying to pose as people like you and everyone else to gain access for forgotten passwords or disabling 2fa briefly etc. 

Do yourself a favor so you’re not so quick to listen believe and follow a strangers grievance from reddit and do your own research to confirm if this person is or isn’t onto something. My guess is if they are real. They’re leaving out the smoking gun of WHY it got disabled and it’s prob for their own protection. 

Can’t you guys critically think or even Just think of WHY bittrex would do this. If they were shutting down accounts arbitrarily .. why? It’s not standard to keep 120k on there but you think they need that money more than the amount in fees they collect and keeping a positive reputation so users like myself can speak their truth like this of saying it’s hard for me to believe these horror customer service bittrex stories because the real website (many clones and fakes..) has never been less than stellar to me.

"Has it ever occured to you that there might be different useful cryptos with different use cases?
Gold, diamonds and silver have absolutely no value aswell other then being shiny. The value has only simply risen as high as it did, cause people give these that value. Gold has risen many 100% the past 20 years, only because ppl believe in it as a store of value and theres only a fixed amount of it. And hey while were on it... Paper money has absolutely no fucking value aswell, and over 95% in curculation are only there because of dept. 
The vision is still there and the cryptos and especially the bitcoin are changing and going though constant evolution. And there are already ideas being worked on to scale it to a level of VISA, concerning the amount of transactions it can handle.
And on the other hand side, BTC would already do a good job as a store of value besides the current high volatility mostly due to tge fact that it is still in a very early adopter phase.

"You are just so wrong on so many counts, gold, copper, diamonds real estate etc all have value because they can be used, gold goes into electronics and jewelry, diamonds go into industrial and domestic use and paper money is backed by the assets owned by the government, it has a guaranteed value.

Crypto on the other hand has no real value other than what people are willing to pay for it, it is too volatile and valuable to be used a true currency and as it doesn't physically exist in any form it has not value as an investment vehicle (it was never designed to be an investment vehicle).

I think the biggest problem is the relatively low amount available, there is simply never going to be enough of them to be a serious currency, who wants to pay 0.0001 coin for anything  it's like having a paper currency with the lowest denomination of $1000.00 ";1;1;False;Borngrumpy;dpqv2ty;⚡⚡⚡ Bitcoin hits $6,500 and reaches a new ATH ⚡⚡⚡;7a2i4x;https://i.imgur.com/qpBnqBN.png

"You generate coins in a shared pool proportional to your own hashrate contribution. If you provide 1% of the power in a shared pool, your payout of the block is 1%. Higher hashrate devices increases your percentage of the payout, which is why ASICs yield more than a CPU would.

Technically they are incentivized to mine the most profitable coin, but this is not always cut and dry because coins are not spendable for 100 blocks after minting and then have to be transferred to an exchange and sold.

"It isn't really healthy for the altcoin.  What you're suggesting is printing money faster.  Guess what happens when you try to pay people more by printing money faster?  :)

To the best of my knowledge, the lowered difficulty and resulting hashrate rush that produced blocks (and thus coin rewards) at ~2 minutes intead of 10 minutes should actually have driven down the value of Bitcoin Cash because of faster inflation.  I think the only reason that Bitcoin Cash actually went up instead of down is that people saw the mass hashrate move, saw that as proof of mass adoption, and the hype level went off the charts.  ""Look, proof everyone is moving to Bitcoin Cash!  I have charts proving it!""  But of course, as soon as the crazy divergence balances back out, miners move again.

https://fork.lol/reward/inflation

Take this all with a grain of salt though.  I wouldn't call myself an expert, and this is a pretty complex situation.  Quirks like the fact that coin production slowly phases out, meaning that if you increase inflation now you actually reach the end of inflation faster are hard for me to imagine how to factor in, though I suspect that is all very-long-term stuff not super relevant to the next year or two.";3;0;False;mattbuford;dpqc41m;Please take a moment to thank Slush.

"This is actually true. I'm not a big fan of BCH over BTC, but there is no doubt that miners will follow the money. That's the point.

Once BCH's difficulty becomes comparable to BTCs, the real difference in profitability will come from the market price. That's what's going to decide which will end up the stronger coin - simple demand for btc vs bch. The miners should just act rationally.

"Many times when BCH was having really crazy EDA issues, Jihan kept mining that chain at a much lower reward even if all miners were over at the BTC chain.  Does that conclude as well that the experiment had failed on the BCH end?

For me, it's the miner's prerogative in determining what their perceived (including current and future) profit will be.  A decision like this can come from considering future ETFs / futures, altcoins owned and pegged to BTC value, and even more complex categorizations.

Yep. Their stipulation is that they will mine as long as it is profitable.

"If you want to stand to make any profit then you'll need to buy direct from the manufacture and often will need to pre-order two or three months in advance. I'd suggest buying ASICs from either Canaan or Bitmain. Once they arrive if market is good you stand to make ROI in about 3-4 months and then (depending on ASIC and market and electricity) $150-$800 a month thereafter with eventually diminishing returns. You can calculate this and factor in price and expected difficulty increases here http://btcwisdom.net/calc/

As for the ones you find second hand, well eBay is where ASICs go to die. Everything on eBay is over priced it's where miners go to sell hardware that is A) no longer profitable for a high price to gullible people that will never make a profit but give miners enough money to place a pre-order to make them a profit off a new ASIC, or B) where people buy an ASIC direct from manufacture and try and sell it for 3x the price on eBay, if someone buys it instant ROI, if no one buys it that's okay because they get to mine with it and make an ROI that way.

If you just want to do it as a sort of hobbiest then I suppose you could get some real old miners second hand that will at best make you enough money to cover electricity. But at that point you may as well be buying one of those little USB gimics of a miner if you don't care about profits and just want to contribute to decentralization.

Miners that do not seek to attain optimal profits are at risk of being outcompeted by those that do.  Bitcoin mining always moves toward mining costs being near to value of coins mined.

"lots of people here can probably explain it better than I.

Miners perform calculations based on a particular algorithm and based on the contents of a block of transactions in order to find a number which is below a certain threshold (known as the difficulty).  The threshold (difficulty) is adjusted every 2016 blocks so that the task the miners perform results in a discovery roughly every 10 minutes.  When a miner discovers a block with its transactions he has put inside it and a variable number that he uses to retry the algorithm until it succeeds he then announces that block to the network of miners who validate that he did indeed provide a valid input to the algorithm whose result is below the current threshold difficulty value.  The miner includes a transaction that pays out to himself - and thus earns a reward.

As the bitcoin price increases the reward increases, making it profitable for more miners to buy equipment and start mining.  Thus the marginal cost of mining always trends towards the rewards gained.

Miners have a lot of costs to run their farms - they probably borrow money for the hard ware, they have high electricity costs and so on.

Miners are incentivized to produce valid blocks because if they don't their blocks will be rejected - causing a huge waste of their money.  Miners are also incentivized to not gain too much market share because if they are producing most of the blocks who is left to ensure that they are doing the right thing?- this would diminish trust in the coin - resulting in decrease in value and therefore causing the miner to lose money.

When miners move their equipment to mine another coin then the rate at which new blocks are found will no longer be 10 minutes on average.  Since most blocks are full even when they are produced at 10 minute intervals the potential for backlogs then arise.  Since space is limited to 1mb of transactions per 10 minutes on average, people start to pay higher fees to jump the queue - this can result in unpredictable fees and unpredictable times for your transactions to go through.";5;1;False;papabitcoin;dpqd2w0;Please take a moment to thank Slush.

Bitcoin is still in it's early growing stage. Imo. It is going to replace most fiat currency transactions worldwide.

I'm a miner.  

Personally, if it dropped to a dime, in price, I would still run the miners. Just to support the network itself. 

Bitcoin has overpaid, all of my investments, so much that it would only be fitting to 'give some back'.

I understand your point of view as far as profiting from the cost's involved in mining BTC.  It's not all about the money.

Helping to maintain a new, decentralized, person to person means of exchanging value, has it's own rewards...  ;  )  I love it.

All correct.

I built a small Raspberry Pi farm of 4 U2s. I was mining dust. I think anyone looking to use Blockchain technologies should spend some time mining, even if at dust rates the earliest their pool will pay out is over a few months. It helps understand the process from top to bottom. The odds that I'd find a solution on my own is staggeringly low when compared with the hash power of the ASIC work horses, but it's rewarding to try nonetheless.

"The difficulty adjustment in Bitcoin is too strict, it takes too long to adjust. With more competitors fighting for hash power, couldn't the number of blocks be reduced somehow?

This is a very delicate setting, a wrong setting may make mining switches a shitshow, but the current difficulty adjustments only works because Bitcoin is king. I hope a middleground is found between being strict and too relaxed (like bitcoin cash's EDA, which will be removed)

In your hypothetical scenario, if one cpu is left, that 1 cpu will not be able to find a block in 10 000 years, let alone find enough blocks until the difficulty adustment.

One could argue it was less profitable to mine BTC while BCH was ~$300 and dump it when it spiked.

But no one can tell the future, so.

During that few hour stretch, most miners who switched from BTC to BCH ultimately made less.

"Large user base across a broad spectrum of all stakeholders:

* Currency investors
* Currency traders
* Exchanges
* Regulatory engagement
* Miners
* Wallet providers
* Consumers
* Merchants
* Payment providers
* Technology companies
* Media attention

To some extent it has some representation in all of these sectors, but not really to much more extent than other altcoins. What exposure it has is mainly down to it being a fork of bitcoin therefore little investment was required to support it, however there isn't anyone actively staking their business on it.

Whilst the market cap of BCH might be significant on paper, I'd be willing to bet that most of those holding BCH coins haven't even bothered to download the client to move them yet. Apart from speculative use, nobody is using BCH who doesn't already have it as a result of the fork, whereas people are getting bitcoin for practical reasons (albeit I'd bet most of the activity is still speculation).

Basically, my bottom line is, the intrinsic (as opposed to speculative) value of a cryptocurrency is tied to it's utility x user base. Bitcoin has utility and it has user base. BCH has less of each. I'd say long-term ETH is probably a better bet over BCH, plus it has the advantage from an investment point of view of being less correlated due to having more significant technological differences and different feature set.

"Yeah, I guess if they are smart, they'll have cashed in at the peak, and maybe they can manage expectations a bit and get another round in during another spike later on, but sooner or later everyone will get bored of BCH and they'll need to generate some new drama over something else.

TBH it doesn't really matter what the other thing is, apart from 1) they can profitably use their mining hardware on it 2) they can improve their profits by switching between it and bitcoin and manipulating prices.

If you're buying and selling BTC, the way to get the most for your money is to use GDAX and set a 'limit buy' (you'll see what that is once you get there). You have to set it below the current price, essentially, betting it will drop (even if only by a penny), but if you do it that way, you will not have to pay any fees, and you know how much exactly you are paying per coin. Coinbase just sells you coins at market value, and charges a fee, so you pay more that way.;2;0;False;;dpqgfjc;SegWit2X Cancelled?;7bmpnn;https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-segwit2x/2017-November/000685.html

Simplified Payment Verification
It is possible to verify payments without running a full network node.  A user only needs to keep
a copy of the block headers of the longest proof-of-work chain, which he can get by querying
network   nodes   until   he's   convinced   he   has   the   longest   chain,   and   obtain   the   Merkle   branch
linking   the   transaction   to   the   block   it's   timestamped   in.

A reasonable point, but I don't fully buy the assertion that paper volume is the cause of opaqueness.

"I'd have to disagree about BTC having a superior price discovery to PMs as PMs have an actual real-world use (jewelry, electronics, medicine, aerospace, etc) which has a direct impact on supply/demand.  As far as I can tell, BTC is largely speculative at this point, hence the insane volatility, and thus inferior price discovery.

You are right about inflating the market with artificial supply from paper contracts and it's the same thing that happens in the PM markets.  Gold trades at something like 100-to-1 in paper contracts versus what actually exists in the real world - this can only be done because these contracts can be settled in cash and physical gold isn't wanted.

Ideally, BTC and PMs would join forces instead of arguing about which is better.  You can't beat the uncounterfeitable (not a word?) properties of both and they complement each other beautifully.  A physical, undeniable representation of value and a distributed digital ledger to verify it.  What's not to love?

Regarding dystopia, Gold too requires some form of civilization to remain intact to keep it's value going, a user base, and an interest in a shiny metal to keep itself going.  Canned soup, liters of gasoline, guns and ammo for example might be better investments/stores of value/units of account than gold under scenarios where we need to worry access to electricity.

"A futures market is traditionally used by producers who need commodities but don't necessarily want to hold the commodity at a particular time.  For instance, if you produce clothing and know you'll need x-amount of cotton you can buy it from a producer now who will produce it for you in the future at an agreed upon price.  This obviously has impacts on both producers and consumers but it opens up another avenue of buying and selling that wouldn't exist otherwise.

The issue, however, is with the speculators.  You have people buying futures contracts that have no need for a particular commodity, they just think the price will go up or down and they'll profit on it at the other end.  These speculators never have to take possession of the commodity, or even own it to sell it, they're just selling the contracts.  There can be more contracts out on a commodity than it exists in reality because these contracts are settled in cash, not the commodity itself.

"But what is the problem with shorting Bitcoin without selling on exchanges, won't the price be unaffected by that (other than people interpreting a short as an expert expectation or something)? How could they ""short us to death""?

The trouble I have here, I think, is to wrap my head around people selling futures in one place parallel to people selling the actual commodity on exchanges. How could trading futures affect the price on exchanges unless people buy or sell Bitcoin there?

"I have no idea what will happen and everything I've written is a VERY basic explanation of futures contracts.  There's a very real chance that BTC will shoot up in price once futures contracts are enacted, but do you think that's because the general public love and use BTC or because the bankers have gotten their hands on it?

As I wrote in a previous comment, do you really want BTC being bought and sold before they even exist on the blockchain?  I very much love the blockchain technology and believe it's here to say, but I have no idea what's going to happen to BTC itself.  People seemingly forget that these are two separate things entirely.

"Had a nightmare that BTC and BCH were both at $3k.  Take this strategy for what it is worth if you want to trade but are new, nervous and susceptible to FUDL:

Under normal fluctuations, DCA about $50/week or whatever you can afford.  Under steep rises...HODL.  Under attacks or dips, this is where a good method can help curb emotional response.  

1. Use only when BTC drops $500 or more (assume a start point of $7,000 for this example)
2. For every $100 BTC drops, buy $100 (or some set level you decide on) down to $6,000
3. For every $100 more BTC drops, buy $200 (or some increased set level you decide on) down to $5,000
4. If BTC rises again by at least $500, go to step 1
5. New starting point and percentages based on what current prices are and your own threshold for investing.
6. DO NOT DEVIATE - if you believe in the technology and are in it for the long haul, be consistent.";9;2;False;;dprgeah;To everyone who bought in the dip...;7cl909;https://i.redd.it/1ex0gcm7qoxz.jpg
