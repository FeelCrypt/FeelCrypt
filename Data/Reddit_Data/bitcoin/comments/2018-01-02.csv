"Dear Pine,

Please consider a donation to the OpenLitterMap.com project - a citizen science game to enable anyone to map and open up data on plastic pollution anywhere & pay people in Littercoin for their efforts. 

Plastic pollution was first recognised to have a global distribution in the marine environment as early as 1975 (Rees and Pond, 1995). In 2010 alone, 8-12 million tonnes of plastic made its way from land to sea, which by 2025 is expected to increase to more than 70 million tonnes, assuming current trends continue (Jambeck et al., 2015).

Mapping and Opening up data on litter, plastic pollution anywhere will give the scientific and geospatial community the data needed to educate society and enforce better rules and improve public services, making our existing public services more cost-effective at stopping plastic reaching the ocean and saving us trillions in environmental damage.

There are now more than 50 trillion pieces of plastic in the ocean, more than 500 times the number of stars in our galaxy. 

We have not been able to stop plastic reaching the ocean. I would love to give the PineappleFund a chance to make a big impact by supporting the OpenLitterMap and Littercoin project!
