I'm sure someone could create a crypto currency of which just one exists of it, people buy/sell decimals of it as that's the only way it can possibly be bought/sold, and it could maybe be worth $20,000 USD / coin, maybe even $1,000,000 / coin (the only coin, that is, its market cap)....

"So now that China has set up the gold-backed Yuan exchanges for oil... Your answer to that is....? US can only bully small countries with weak militaries into doing as it pleases. Not countries that can put up a reasonable fight, because the US population's appetite for a total war with a capable, modern enemy is basically non-existent. Even after all of Trump's rhetoric. A war of attrition wouldn't be stomached by US population for more than a couple weeks. Look how much backlash there was over Iraq, which saw 4,500 US troops killed over a decade. Imagine that many lost each day for weeks...

You could point to the trade war as a first step of trying to dissuade or bring about the destruction of a future Petro Yuan. But the fact that they haven't acted as aggressively against China, who has gone further towards ending its reliance on USD for oil trade, as it acted against Libya and Iraq, shows that it is really only willing to take on in a war scenario much weaker foes in order to keep USD hegemony, it won't fight a capable foe for that end.

Also keep in mind that the UK/GBP had reserve currency status until the 50s or so, maybe early 60s, whenever the Suez Crisis occurred, and it was the UK's unwillingness to go to war over that crisis that many view as the end of the GBP reserve status. Its not like losing reserve status totally destroyed the GBP or the UK, but it did lead to decades of sub-par economic activity that's for sure. Obviously the UK was in decline for a long time before that, but when we look back on history in 50 years and maybe USD loses reserve status in that time, we may point to events like dot-com bubble, war on terror and expansion of debt, followed by Financial Crisis and further expansion of debt, followed by Trump, tax cuts at the top of an economic expansion and *further* expansion of debt, as chief reasons for its downfall.

"That’s just military strength.  You’re absolutely correct that no other country can boss us around because we have the best military on the planet.  That’s very clear.  China can’t strong arm us into doing any bullshit thanks to our military strength. 

But I still don’t see how that’s related to an economically strong dollar.  Foreign exchange markets move in price just like all other securities markets.  Right now the dollar is regarded as quite strong and the economy is doing well, but if the economy hits a recession and the dollar grows weak, the guns don’t really play a role.  

Saying the USD is “backed by guns” seems akin saying “we cannot possibly have another Great Depression as long as our military stays strong.”  Unless I am grossly misinterpreting your point.  I fully agree that having a strong military is critical to our defense and survival, but I don’t see how it protects our financial economy in any way.";1;1;False;McBurger;etqt4tu;FUD;cctla5;https://i.redd.it/hwk6mdvpk4a31.jpg

"I was speaking of what gives US Dollar value. It's a tax credit.

And converting bitcoin to USD to use to pay taxes isn't paying taxes in Bitcoin. It's converting and bitcoin into USD. After that you aren't using bitcoin.";2;2;False;skylowr;etqf4a9;FUD;cctla5;https://i.redd.it/hwk6mdvpk4a31.jpg
"Imagine you're a business that operates only in BTC, but has to pay taxes in USD at the end of the year/quarter. Let's use sales tax as an example, I know there's not federal sales tax in the USA at least I don't think there is, but some states have it and we have it federally in Canada and a lot of countries.

So you have a 10% sales tax and you account for that in all your sales. You sold 1,000,000 BTC worth of product, you're doing fucking awesome, and put aside 100,000 BTC (10% of every sale at time of the sale) to pay the tax man their 10% at the end of the quarter/year. But wait, what's this?! It's Feb/March 2019 (2018 tax season) and BTC just lost 80% in the last 12 months! You go to convert your 100,000 BTC but it doesn't satisfy your tax bill in USD, you actually need to convert 300,000 to 500,000 or whatever BTC (hard to calculate, because obviously all sales didn't happen at the top, most happened somewhere in between) to USD to pay the taxes owed, because your chosen currency lost significant value vs USD. This is why a business would prefer to make sales and hold their revenue/capital in the currency in which it owes the taxes in, because it is far more predictable how much they need to put aside to pay their taxes and they *know* that that amount will be sufficient, and anything else can be used for expansions/profits to shareholders, or whatever. Businesses need to plan for the future.

The business in question here, despite having a phenomenal year just lost all their profits, maybe went bankrupt entirely if they decided to expand aggressively in this time, because their currency of choice lost a ton of value against the currency they owed in.

Of course the opposite could happen too, and if you're a crypto bull you do expect the opposite to happen most years, and that'll work out really well for the business... But it just takes one bad year to absolutely ruin a business, especially a smaller business (not used in my example clearly lol), or one that is aggressively expanding.

I'm not saying having to pay taxes in a certain currency is sufficient for that currency to maintain its value, especially not over long periods of time, but it does add to the compelling nature of that currency, ensures it will have a use case at least once every quarter/year, so it does help. And I think you just weren't really understanding the issues involved with doing business in one currency, and paying taxes in another.. Multi-national corporations deal with this all the time, but their benefit is that often what they lose in once currency they may gain in another in another part of the world. They also probably do the vast majority of their business in the currency in which they must pay the majority of their taxes in. They also owe mostly local taxes in the local currency in a lot of countries (especially regarding sales/corporate taxes). They also utilize tax havens and such to store their capital in, perhaps until a more ideal scenario arises such as the recent tax cuts allowing them to bring a lot of money back to the USA tax free.

I’d say that most technologies are not environmentally sustainable so it’s kind of an irrelevant question. Like light bulbs, bitcoin can be made more efficient and made to use less energy.

We’re talking about a global network of value, with p2p transactions and a trustless ledger. This shit is capable of running the entire global economic system. Of course it’s gonna draw a fuck ton of power. Just like most technologies the world runs on - they’re environmentally unsustainable.

"Do you remember the whole gaddafi fiasco? The reason was he was assassinated was because Libya didn't wanna play ball with the US. They started amassing massive amounts of gold to try and trade oil for it. We killed him for that. It was not because he was a brutal dictator or anything like that. The US supports something like 60%+ of the world's dictatorships.

Essentially once we got off the gold reserve, the USA had to peg the dollar to something. So we made a deal with Saudi Arabia that meant that you are only able to buy their oil with USD. That is referred to as the Petro dollar. 

It doesn't matter if the euro or the GBP is worth more than a dollar. At the end of the day, if they want to buy oil, they need to use USD. If they were to try and get away from that system, then that's when you'll see the US start to flex. This is what most people mean by saying that the USD is backed by the US military.

">USD is backed by guns

Lmfao okay.  Please entertain me and explain this.  You, and thousands of others, love to repeat this. 

Right now the USD is worth about .89 EUR.  

Let’s pretend the US deficit continues to grow, inflation starts to occur, and recession & unemployment start to creep up. 

This would cause the value of the USD to fall farther.  Perhaps a USD will be only worth .60 Euro. 

At what point do the guns kick in?  Really, I’m curious to know. 

Let’s say it falls farther.  Other countries stop trusting our currency, and were defaulting on debts, and the rest of the world wants to offload their USD. 

When do the guns kick in?

How the fuck is our currency backed by guns?  Are we just supposed to do some sort of... ground invasion against Australia if the AUD grows too strong against the USD?  Do we bomb China if foreign exchange rates move too much?

How the fuck is our currency backed by guns?  We kill everybody that thinks it’s worthless? Lol.";0;2;False;McBurger;etqka9t;FUD;cctla5;https://i.redd.it/hwk6mdvpk4a31.jpg

USD is backed by guns. As soon as crypto actually starts behaving as a currency it'll be shut down. Right now it's all speculative trading.;4;4;False;yeahnokidding;etpxhsl;FUD;cctla5;https://i.redd.it/hwk6mdvpk4a31.jpg

"Obama was garbage and Hillary much worse. Trump bombed the crap out of Syria for over a year before laying low. Bombing Syrian airfields twice based on fake poison gas attacks! 

Trump created the Iran crises to suck up to Israel and he has NO plan to defuse the tension. If he's not going to war with Iran, then why is he sending so much military assets there? I hope the war industry won't get us into another never ending war in the Middle East   🙏🏼

And who was going to war with N. Korea? Trump is the first president since the Korean War who threatened N. Korea and then backed off!
