That's not true. All transaction values are integers, and they are in units of satoshis, that is, 0.00000001 BTC. If you send me one bitcoin, you're actually sending me 100,000,000 satoshis. Changing this would be the same, from a protocol standpoint, as increasing the number of bitcoins in existence, because it would be necessary to increase the number of base units.

"This may not be worth saying since it's obvious that you're joking, but waiting for 6 confirmations isn't necessary. Somehow that idea really took hold, but it simply isn't true. Waiting for that many confirmations makes sense for a large transaction, like purchasing a car, because the seller is defending themselves against the risk of a double-spend.

In this case, the mugger has to think about the risk of getting caught while waiting, so it's smarter to book it after *propagation* through the network, which takes seconds.  

Again, it's obvious that you were joking, but I like to clear up important misconceptions if I can, and this one was easy.

You can always shut your phone off, and I assume it wouldn't load your information if it was in cold storage, i.e. Coinbase.

"> I think this is the biggest flaw in bitcoin, you ultimately will be laid bare by violent criminals.

"Unlikely and relatively easily mitigated, if you ask me.

1. Violent criminals could do this today. I suppose they do, at ATMs.
2. If it happened with any volume, deniable cryptography can hide which accounts you have. Criminals dont have the resources to determine who owns which address.
3. From what i heard bitcoin can do multi-signature accounts.
