"You don't need free. Negligible would work. You could make the argument fiat currencies have 'fees', you just don't see them. Someone is paying for those dollar bills to be printed. Fees are integral to the market in this case. This is the breakthrough part of this whole ecosystem. You now have a decentralized ecosystem with a monetary incentive to participate. 



Don't forget about venture capital, literally billions of dollars. Also consider there are a bunch of developers in the space that have sold bitcoin along the way to continue working. See Andreas Antonopolous as an example. He spent his bitcoin so he could continue to work in the space, and it's not a stretch to say others have as well. That is time and effort ($$) in the space. Look at all the ICO's and how much money went their way this year alone. Many of the companies converted to fiat because of bitcoins volatility, of course they would not keep all their funds there. The point is, they have funds for the next couple of years easy. There's still a lot of uncertainty, but its false to say there is isn't a single dollar in the bitcoin space. Just take a look at how many developer tools are being downloaded. There's a ton of people working on this space. That is of value, in the space itself.

Another here with ME/CFS and a lost career at the peak of life.  We need a biomarker and FDA-approved treatments.  OMF is doing aggressive cutting-edge work and collaborating with a team of researchers worldwide.  The NIH has denied multiple grant proposals, but patient support through private donations has kept them advancing.  They have strategic plans in the works to answer questions and cover research gaps that must be addressed to move the research.  OMF puts every penny to work and is focussed on keeping medical costs down.  There is good reason that the patient community is behind this organization, they are doing real science to help millions of people return to health and living their lives.

"Hi,

fantastic to see your approach to this - I'd love to be in a position to do exactly what you're doing

I can't lie, if I found myself in your position, I would most definitely go down the lambo/nice car/holidays etc route, but I'd like to think my spends would also be very large amounts to charity like you :-)

Anyway, to your original Q OP:

I'd like to put forward any charities involved in research and support for Dystonia

https://www.reddit.com/r/Dystonia/

I am a sufferer myself, but am fortunate enough to be one of those that only has (reasonably) mild symptoms

I have, however, met many that are severely disabled by this awful disease which very little is known about (I myself had seen many doctors with various symptoms from my early teens, but i was only diagnosed in my early 30's)

As a brief run down, Dystonia is similar to the symptoms of Parkinson's disease, but ifs more often than not non degenerative (Parkinsons symptoms are in fact secondary Dysonia, in that the Dystonic movement (spasms etc) are secondary to the main Parkinson's disease, whereas in Primary Dystonia it is in and off itself)

As I have said, my symptoms are quite mild, but I have the rarer form, global Dystonia that can affect many parts of the body - I myself suffer from severe writers cramp (it hurts to write more than a sentence), weakness in the right leg, and, for me at least, the worst - Laryngeal Dysphonia that makes me sound very, very hoarse to the point phone calls are near impossible and face to face conversations quite difficult, especially as strangers often assume I have a stammer.

For me, a very social, outgoing person this is a nightmare, but as I have said, mild compared to others I have met.

I feel very, very little is known of Dystonia both in the medical profession and the public at large and so this would be an area that would benefit greatly from a decent donation to assist awareness and research.

I am aware that you have a VERY large amount of responses, so if you do read this I thank you for your time to read my 2 cents!

Whether you decide to donate to Dystonia or not, I congratulate you on your approach to this new found wealth, and wish you the very best in finding a way to achieve the most for humanity with your generous gifts.

"Here is a french innovative and cooperative project of a place in Paris, by a young cooperative called Samouraï Coop. The project called ""TERAA"" (*Terminal of Exchanges and Resources About Autonomy) is created as a P2P project including people from french guetto to make them autonomous from financial system, and politics.
They want to promote informations, resources, and projects about culture, food, health, blockchain of course, school, and energy... and team is composed of great engineers, artist, teachers, crypto experts and creative people... ! 

Its a hudge project which need about 3,5 m$ to buy and rehab a building for this cooperative place.
I think you could love this project... and the team is really serious and professionnal, working as ""samouraï"" since 2014 !

They need support... !
https://www.cooperativesamourai.com/projet-teraa

If they successfully buy & rehab the building, the project make money for people around, and make free culture, free tools and free lessons for autonomy ! Its a disruptive project which really need attentions from crypto community, cause the team is in a non-profit way to work, and really need help from all over the world to go forward !

In ten or twenty years, the concept of TERAA will be duplicated as a P2P world project of places to cooperate and learn about autonomy !

"My considered advice to fund recipients is to hodl the Bitcoin; don't sell your Bitcoin; keep it held as Bitcoin (in safe wallets held by you with your good management).  Spend it an equal % per year equal to your time horizon for your charity.  Such as, if it will take 40 years to bring desalinated drinking water using slant wells and solar panels to all of Africa, then only spend 2.5% of your Bitcoin per year.  The reason is, the Bitcoin will go up in value, so each year, you can grow along with your Bitcoin.

If you sell all your Bitcoin now, you will miss out on BILLIONS OF DOLLARS for your charity.  DON'T BE STUPID!  Hold and spend the Bitcoin a little at a time equal to your time horizon.

Get multiple good wallets and good wallet management.  Use only cold storage with multiple locations and multiple signers.  DO NOT BE STUPID!  This requires good conservative management with good conservative experienced programmers, logicians and accountants, which ought to be in ample supply in your charity already if it means to do any good (well, the way I see the world).  If not ... I don't know how to find them, but don't take the first thief off the streets, or the first thief out of the silk gowns.

Remember:  Bitcoin will drop many times.  Look at the 9 year chart for Bitcoin price.  Zoom out, then zoom in, then zoom out.  OK?  Your job is to hold during drops, not to sell.  In fact, your job is to do nothing.

Have multiple wallets.  Some wallets are holding wallets and some are spending wallets.  Only move the correct % in the correct period to the spending wallets; that is, once per year, move 2% or whatever of your Bitcoin into the spending wallets.";1;1;False;Bwa_aptos;drdqssu;I'm donating 5057 BTC to charitable causes!

"For advice I would suggest you talk to the experts at Open Philanthropy Project https://www.openphilanthropy.org/. They are giving away a huge sum of money to a variety of causes based on the principles of Effective Altruism - using careful evidence and analysis to do the most good we can. It is funded mostly by Dustin Moskowitz (Facebook and Asana), and has GiveWell's founders as part of the management team. 

Open Phil's processes are extremely rigorous, and they fund a wide variety of projects including highly evidence based organisations like Against Malaria Foundation, as well as far more speculative projects which have high risk but potentially high reward such as funding pandemic preparedness research.

Please consider donating to Southern Research’s STEM Outreach program. We bring stimulating, hands-on learning experiences focusing on science, technology, engineering and math to students across the state of Alabama. Alabama's students have performed poorly on national standardized tests, with proficiency levels ranging from 23 to 39 percent. Many Alabama students unfortunately attend high schools where classes like Algebra 2, chemistry and physics are not even offered. A donation from the Pineapple Fund would enable us to renovate an old library space into a STEM lab where schools can bring their students to engage in laboratory learning experiences lead by scientists and engineers. A donation would empower the many diverse communities of Alabama and stimulate the state’s STEM learning environment. Regaining and promoting science and math literacy is imperative to the future of our students.

"My dad asked me if it made sense to buy a full coin.. I said it could, but to be risk averse it wouldn't make sense. My brother is a finance guy and told him it was too risky.. my dad is almost retiring... so the risk is very high if there's a crash like 2013 where it takes years to recover, if at all. 

My dad talked to my brother at 16k... I told my dad about it at 8k and bought at 8900. 

I don't talk to my brother about finance because he is super smart in current market model... he's a tech person too and mathematician, but I don't think he's read the white paper, and I think he's been focused on work too much to dedicate time to understand the potential disruption... I may have dedicated too much time, including reading the white paper, articles, watching videos, debates, and watching the price changes. 

I'm hodling my dad's ... I'm hodling mine ... I started 2 months ago to learn and get in... I'm a relative noob but I feel like I understand not just the tech, but the goal. A year ago, I was too concerned about not understanding that I never bothered to learn. I kick myself every day for not dedicating the time before.. the three or four years ago when I heard about BTC...  

If it weren't for my two friends, I would have never gotten in. They hinted at but didn't push and allowed me to use the trust in them to build my own desire to learn. 

When my dad told my mom he invested, my mom said that it was risky.. and that maybe it's too late.. when my dad said it was 500 and when I said it was my fiat to minimize their risk.. she said ""oh..I thought you had done a full coin"".. needless to say they aren't as concerned now... although my mom keeps telling me to pull my initial investment and let the profits ride. I'm not ready for that due to taxes.. waiting on long term capital to rake effect. ";1;0;False;cxr303;drdyjky;BTC Grandpa already doubled his profit.;7ke4u2;https://i.redd.it/oq0o0kq2xh401.jpg

"You are completely and totally missing the point. There was no credit involved in this transaction. This is just a Bitcoin 1 percent-er buying a home outright from some idiots trying to capitalize on the mania.

Ask yourself, how many people buy a house in cash? The problem is that for the average person, buying a home outright, whether in cash, gold, or Bitcoin, is impossible. So who is going to loan you enough Bitcoin to buy a house? Who in their right mind would give or take a loan in Bitcoin?

Let's imagine a BTC economy. Your income is 0.5 BTC per month. You find someone to loan you 10 BTC to buy a house. A year later BTC is now 100% more expensive. Houses are going for 5 BTC and hour income is 0.25 BTC per month. So now your house isn't even 50% of what you owe and is a whopping 40x your monthly income instead of 20x. And it just gets worse and worse every year. You will never pay your loan off, ever.

Even assuming more reasonable values like 5% or 10% deflation, it doesn't work. Deflation is utterly catastrophic for any credit based economy. No one would ever be able to take a loan. You couldn't ever buy a house or start a business. It would be the most catastrophically unequal society imaginable.

"All I'm saying is that those economics ought to be focused on blockchain and distributed financial networks in general, rather than Bitcoin specifically. Using it as an example is fine, but Bitcoin will never take over as a major currency.

>academia does not impart fundamental truths

No shit. My undergrad had a healthy smattering of traditional micro/ macro, as well as plenty of Austrian so that I could learn both sides. I think there is a lot of logical truth in Austrian, but there is also a lot to be learned from dissecting a problem mathematically.

The point I made is that currently transaction costs and the knowledge barrier to entry is very high with Bitcoin right now, and while many wallets and exchanges simplify the process it's still not usable as a currency in day-to-day life. If you want to use Bitcoin for anything major, you still have to exchange it to dollars. As-is, its primary use is as an investment vessel, and we're very likely looking at a price bubble. If it pops good luck getting the general public to buy into it as a viable currency again.";1;0;False;FalloutRip;drdovnn;"Bitcoin exposes the massive economic illiteracy of financial journalism; arm yourselves with knowledge.";7iyej5;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7iyej5/bitcoin_exposes_the_massive_economic_illiteracy/

So Bitcoin always ANYONE, ANYWHERE in the world, to control, handle, transfer, share...THEIR OWN MONEY! The dicks on Wall st. have no idea whats goin on...all they see is potential profits...FOMO. 

I will ask you this, when did they start buying Bitcoin? A few months ago? Last year? All I hear from wealthy folks is its for drugs and porn and ""that dark web thing"". Thanks to the GREED of the current rich FOMO, the less wealthy (from all over the world), started to acquire more wealth.

"The Federal Reserve ain't the slave, bro, they're the slave master.

Look at a dollar bill. What's it say? *Federal Reserve Note*. What's that mean? Must be part of the government, right? Nope, they're a *private bank*. And they control everything about money, interest rates, and loans. The US Treasury prints more money *when the Federal Reserve tells them to*. A private bank controls our money. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_System

>Although an instrument of the U.S. Government, the Federal Reserve System considers itself ""an independent central bank because its monetary policy decisions do not have to be approved by the President or anyone else in the executive or legislative branches of government, it does not receive funding appropriated by the Congress, and the terms of the members of the Board of Governors span multiple presidential and congressional terms.""[22] The federal government sets the salaries of the board's seven governors. The federal government receives all the system's annual profits, after a statutory dividend of 6% on member banks' capital investment is paid, and an account surplus is maintained. In 2015, the Federal Reserve made a profit of $100.2 billion and transferred $97.7 billion to the U.S. Treasury.[23]

>>The term ""monetary policy"" refers to the actions undertaken by a central bank, such as the Federal Reserve, to influence the availability and cost of money and credit to help promote national economic goals. What happens to money and credit affects interest rates (the cost of credit) and the performance of an economy. The Federal Reserve Act of 1913 gave the Federal Reserve authority to set monetary policy in the United States.[86][87]

>>The Federal Reserve sets monetary policy by influencing the federal funds rate, which is the rate of interbank lending of excess reserves. The rate that banks charge each other for these loans is determined in the interbank market and the Federal Reserve influences this rate through the three ""tools"" of monetary policy described in the Tools section below. The federal funds rate is a short-term interest rate that the FOMC focuses on, which affects the longer-term interest rates throughout the economy.

"“Digital gold”? LOOL. There are just a few rare metals in the table of elements. And to create another one (and mine a ton of it) you have to be God or at least the best alchemist ever lived ;) Existing rare metals are in good demand in the industry, and even if they lose all they “currency” (saving) use one day, their costs will drop tremendously, but never down to zero. 
A crypto currency can be created by just anyone with a little knowledge. Imagine the world where anyone can create their own gold. The first who created his “gold” (or the most persuasive) will be considered the maker of “true” gold, others will have “shit” gold. But if someone more persuasive emerges, his “gold” will become “true”, and the former “true gold” will drop down to zero in one day. And it’ll happen sooner or later, as with any pyramid. Sure you can switch to any other crypto currency. The problem is, if you do it a minute later than Minute X, you’ll be selling your bitcoins for one cent a piece. If you have Marty Mc’Fly as your friend, you sure can get rich on bitcoins;)";1;1;False;KerioReili;drcpk43;Bitcoin is the real Occupy Wall Street.;7jytuc;https://twitter.com/JulianAssange/status/941600368588476416
