I think he was trying to explain how cultural Marxism spreads, by people forcing it onto others. I don’t think he even noticed the racist part of the drawing. Maybe that’s just me.

"Inflation is about the *available* supply of currency, and the populations demand for it. 

With population growth you can have an equaly increased money supply without causing inflation, as the new people make a new demand for currency that the new currency fills.

You can have inflation if you have the same money supply, but you have negative population growth, since now the deceased peoples money will be spread around less people. 

This is why the govnerments ""print money"", if the economy has a higher demand for currency they add new money to the economy, if the economys demand for currency is lowered, they remove money from the economy, often by selling bonds.

Bitcoin won't cause just disinflation, it will cause deflation due to it's limited and ""decreasing"" amount of coins. And if everyone in the world gets behind BTC, it'll cause massive deflation untill everyone has adapted and population growth stagnates.

Sure 1 BTC will always be worth 1 BTC, but for every new person born, there will be less BTC per person.

Deflation will expose you to a higher risk of the economy stagnating due to the increased pay-off by hoarding your currency. The entire economy could collapse, since it's more profitable to *not* invest in production of goods and services.

You need a steady, low(2-3%) and predictable inflation rate to maintain a healthy economy with incentives to invest in progression.

Currency is supposed to be just that, currency; a means to trade goods and services, not an investment object.";0;1;False;TrymWS;e9tddcf;A Picture is Worth a Thousand Words.;9xkzxm;https://i.imgur.com/X7KXRvy.jpg

"Your actual mistake is assuming libertarianism to be a Utopian ideology, it's not. They make no assumptions as to 'everything working out'. Rather, once the proper paradigm is in place, how things work out is the natural order of things. 

For libertarians, the role of the state is to protect the rights of its citizens from having their rights violated or from being oppressed by others. They just also see the state as the ultimate potential violator of rights and tool of oppression if it's left unchecked, and want firm rules, checks and balances in place to prevent the state from overextending its authority to oppress its citizens rather than protect them.

Where modern libertarians get it wrong and where they need to be rightfully criticized, is that they don't believe 'economic oppression' to be a valid concept. People using their wealth to create coercive circumstances for others isn't a point they even try to address.

"Everything you described as within the realm of what the libertarian system would include still sounds like it would need something quite big and powerful to exist, and likely one that would require resources beyond what could be voluntarily fund-raised. 

It exposes the vagueness and inconsistency of libertarianism, beyond the faith-based statements that make at an otherwise illegitimate and fantastical ideology.

> Libertarians don't claim that there aren't private criminals, scammers, etc., that there aren't social ills that would still exist and which should be dealt with somehow.

Somehow - like via some sort of government? Or perhaps some other way (yet to be defined, but certainly likely to emerge as an alternative to big bad government).

And where does this ""dealt with somehow"" stop? If phosphates are bad for the rivers, and people can't be trusted to voluntarily stop using them on masse, does this ""deal with it somehow"" body have the authority to step in? What if it's not obvious to indivdiual consumers how their behaviour is harming others when it occurs in aggregate? What about heating my house with high-sulfur coal?

> Being libertarian doesn't mean not recognizing such social harms or thinking that they're okay.

It just means swearing off any kind of system that might have the resources or authority to deal with them (or at least believing that such a system should be extremely limited, and yet retain the capacity to deal with things)

> Hurting people and stealing are of course things that libertarians believe can be forcefully defended against

Defended against by a body that barely, if at all, uses public funds (taxation is violence-enabled theft)

> Addicts have low demand elasticity which means they don't reduce the amount they want very much when the price increases. This results in thefts that wouldn't otherwise happen. The increased cost also means addicts may be more deprived of other things than they otherwise would be. These are bad effects that should be opposed by anyone wants to reduce the harms caused by drugs to either society in general or the addicts themselves.

Ah - so if there was less government, the price of drugs would be lower, and addicts would be able to afford them. The only issue that addicts pose to a society is the crime they present from not being able to afford their drugs. Let them do what they want, and the rest of us can step over their corpses. 

None of them have kids or dependents so what's the big deal? The health of addicts and the problems stemming from lack their of has 0 effect on society and presents us with 0 burdens. 

TIL that the real problem with opiod addicts is *affordability*. Not losing their jobs/homes/etc because their lack of capacity to function. If they could get more opiods more easily, we'd all be fine.

> Another effect is that drugs are made more potent: because of the risk involved only the most profitable products are worth dealing in, so the low profit, low potency drugs disappear and high profit, high potency drugs are substituted. 

TIL that pharmaceutical companies made oxycontin because of....the risk involved in trafficking low potency drugs? Or let me guess - the pharma companies arent to blame, the government is for allowing them to operate. If there was less government, there would be more competition, and more competition would mean less aggressive sales of harmful drugs.

> Then of course there are the effects of jailing people who aren't addicts and who would otherwise be productive members of society, good parents, etc. If we rounded up everyone who consumes alcohol today that would obviously have very bad effects, and not many of those people really cause problems that justify removing them from society, even if they do have unhealthy habits that we want reduced. The same is true with drug users.

You've lost me with this particular strawman. I never said ""government needs to exist so the addicts can be locked up"". The burden presented by addicts is not the burden of having to incarcerate them. It's the burden of their poorly supported/orphan children growing up to having 0 capacity to function in the world that is survival of the fittest. Nobody gives two shits about the fact that addicts are ""breaking the law"" by using. It's that they have 0 capacity to contribute, support themselves, or their families, and that these problems become shared regardless of government. 

>  Those policies don't have to involve shooting or raping people innocent of any legitimate crimes or doing anything else that libertarians object to.

WTF? Are you actually going with ""I'm libertarian because I don't believe in shooting and raping innocent people, and that's why I believe we should drastically lower taxes, remove business regulations, and reduce the size of government"" ? Seriously? 

So the real question is - did you have this text about drug criminalization pre-prepared and that's why it kind of meanders away from anything I brought up, or did you just purposely miss the point?

Regardless, the fatal flaws of libertarianism are this

1) The definition of it, and the place of where government is and isn't involved within it, changes wildly from person to person. For you (for instance), libetarianism is primarily a lack of police state. Where you think the government would and would not still have a role in this theoretical libertarian society is probably not the same as someone' elses

2) Besides being horribly inconsistent from person to person, it's very faith-based. ""Things will get better if we just removed X!"". Sure, there is a temptation to talk like there's an economic basis for things by using terms like ""elasticity"", but utlimatley it's founded upon faith that less government means a better society. It's fundamentalist in a way. You might as well be saying ""faith in Christ's love and God"" 

3) It's founded on the premise that selfishness is harmless and does not affect others or cost society, but then doubles back and is essentially ""except when it does, then we need government to step in and do something""

No, there's certainly no suggestion in libertarian ideology that once certain institutions are done away with everything left is trustworthy. That's a completely uninformed view of libertarianism. Libertarians don't claim that there aren't private criminals, scammers, etc., that there aren't social ills that would still exist and which should be dealt with somehow.

So what's absurd is this misunderstanding of libertarianism.

That's a ridiculous mis-characterization. The owner of the plane, the guy that will be liable for damage, is the one that has the most interest in coming up with the right rules and who also has the legitimate authority to impose them. Some monopoly that's subject to things like public choice theory and other perverse incentives may or may not impose correct rules for some things but is likely to impose a one-size-fits all policy that's worse for other things.

> And drug addicts won't hurt innocent people or steal from them to support their addictions (that we are totally ok with because freedom). They will keep to themselves and have no kids, because that's how things work out when freedom is maximized and government is minimized

Being libertarian doesn't mean not recognizing such social harms or thinking that they're okay.

Hurting people and stealing are of course things that libertarians believe can be forcefully defended against. If some addict is breaking into a home then having some sort of police stop the break-in, even using violence if necessary, is something that libertarians support. But libertarians are at least economically literate enough to see that the prevalence of such crime is _increased_, not decreased, by the drug war today. It's supporters of the drug war who deserve ridicule for their ignorance of the effects of their chosen policy on causing more addicts to hurt people and steal than otherwise would, not libertarians.

First, making drugs illegal drives up the cost of drugs. Addicts have low demand elasticity which means they don't reduce the amount they want very much when the price increases. This results in thefts that wouldn't otherwise happen. The increased cost also means addicts may be more deprived of other things than they otherwise would be. These are bad effects that should be opposed by anyone wants to reduce the harms caused by drugs to either society in general or the addicts themselves.

Another effect is that drugs are made more potent: because of the risk involved only the most profitable products are worth dealing in, so the low profit, low potency drugs disappear and high profit, high potency drugs are substituted. We saw the same thing with alcohol prohibition where beer disappeared and harder drinks replaced it. The increased potency means the health hazards are also increased. Again, the policies supposedly aimed at reducing harm end up increasing it.

Then of course there are the effects of jailing people who aren't addicts and who would otherwise be productive members of society, good parents, etc. If we rounded up everyone who consumes alcohol today that would obviously have very bad effects, and not many of those people really cause problems that justify removing them from society, even if they do have unhealthy habits that we want reduced. The same is true with drug users.

Drug criminalization does mean that some people who might consume drugs if they were legal or cheap never do, and so some people who would otherwise become addicts don't. That's some small reduction in harm. However that is vastly dwarfed by hundreds of thousands of lives destroyed unnecessarily, the violence caused by the black market that's created, children growing up without parents, etc. all caused by the drug war, not drugs. Completely legalizing all drugs would be hugely beneficial for society even if we didn't implement any new policies to reduce social harms from drugs; criminalization really has proven to be that harmful. But of course we could also implement policies that actually do net good and that would be even better than just legalization. Those policies don't have to involve shooting or raping people innocent of any legitimate crimes or doing anything else that libertarians object to.

> Plus, it would violate the non-aggression principle. So that means they simply wouldnt do it.

The NAP is a normative principle that says people shouldn't commit aggression, not a descriptive principle that says they don't. The NAP also distinguishes aggression from violence defending against aggression. Violence to stop aggression is permissible under the NAP.

Dumping waste into a lake should be illegal in a Libertarian society as it causes harm to those around the lake or downstream from the lake or those that own the lake.

Personally I think that anything that could likely result in a successful civil suit (suing the company that dumped chemicals causing harm to me) should be handled by the government (much like murder causes harm to me).  That means agencies like the EPA should absolutely exist in a libertarian society.

"> For libertarians, the role of the state is to protect the rights of its citizens from having their rights violated or from being oppressed by others

This extremely vague. In the real world of politics, you need concrete positions. Numbers, policy. Your statement is a very simple one in response to very complex problems (like pollution, guns, drugs, beating one's kids, dumping one's trash in the creek, etc. etc.) 

This is my core issue. Answering ""how should the government fix up Main St and what do we do about fentanyl, literacy, littering, and airplane safety?"" with ""whatever maximizes freedom and ensures the rights of citizens are upheld"" is not a real answer

I might as well ask a priest and be told to have faith in the Lord. People want concrete direction from people who are in positions of power.

Would you trust a bus driver who responds ""whatever way gets us there in the way that maximizes your freedom""? when you ask them ""what route are you going to take?""

""Maximum freedom"" doesn't mean anything, and when you start presenting real cases or questions of what ""maximum freedom"" means and where it might present an issue for society that will require tax dollars to deal with, most libertarianism start back peddling.

After about 5-10 examples of how dogmatic commitment to maximum individual freedom wherever possible may be problematic, you get 5-10 concessions that there is still very much a role for government in many things (and therefore very much a role for taxation, regulation, etc.)

And then they don't sound so libertarian anymore.

Big, bold, inspiring statements are really easy to make but it's truly the nuts and bolts that matter. 

I can walk to the Sahara and start talking about how maximum food is important and nutrition is the key to prosperity, but it's a pretty empty position to have. Sexy and technically true? Maybe. Meaningful or workable? Absolutely not.

"Instead of trying to constantly reduce the consumption, and with that the demand for resources. It's probably better to determine what a sustainable extraction of renewable resources is.

Now you'll have the fluctuating demand creating an equlibrium price around a ""fixed"" resource supply that's calculated each year depending on the current renewal rate of the resources.

Third, big government is what leads to crony capitalism - if you want less crony capitalism then you should also want less government which can be corrupted.

I really think it is more risky not holding bitcoin than it is to purchase bitcoin as an investment. Comparing it to fiat currency aside, I think it is important to own bitcoin for diversifying your wealth. We live in uncertain times where nations are facing bubbling unrest and technology seems to be cementing its place in our world. This is not a get rich quick scheme which is at the forefront of the majority of people's minds on this topic. This is about power. Bitcoin = Power.

"No no silly! Those corporations will *voluntarily* act in a fair and ethical matter because if they don't, customers will *voluntarily* choose other options by ""voting with their dollar"" (even if the alternative is more expensive)

After 5-50 years, the corporation behaving poorly and dumping its waste in the lake will either eventually go out of business or will voluntarily change their practices as a matter of competition. Consumers have a ton of disposable income and low prices are only one factor in the decisions they make. That's why Wal-Mart isn't that popular. The way a corporation acts towards its employees, the community, the environment, and the law, are all equal factors for consumers as price and quality, and it's been proven time and time again.

See? Bada bing bada boom no need for government at all. Just voluntary goodness and socially-conscious consumer choice to make the world a better place :) :) :) Koombaya
