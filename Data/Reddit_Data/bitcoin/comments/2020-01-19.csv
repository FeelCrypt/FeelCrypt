"There are some issues with having multiple full node implementations:

- there is no formal spec of the network, because there can’t really be. The network is running live and can’t be easily rolled back, so the way the network acts basically self-defines it. Consider: if you wrote a spec, and then the network deviated from it... now what? Since there is no spec, it is very difficult to code a node from scratch that will act exactly the same way as bitcoin-core, for all edge cases. 

- if there were multiple popular full node implementations, and an edge case bug caused one or more of those implementations to follow a different chain, splitting the network, then how would you resolve the issue? Convince half of the network that they’re just running the ‘wrong code’?

That's why honestly the more people that hold the more volatility you have. And if everybody's holding and not selling that doesn't mean you lose value. In fact it's the contrary if someone buys the last 10 bitcoins out of 10000 bitcoin's left the market will explode. Because someone sold higher then the current value and the buyer paid way more then it was currently worth. Pushing the price up. Supply and demand. This is what makes gold valuable when nobody sells and everybody buys the price goes up. Gold was most valuable in the late 80s early 90s.

"In case any newbies are reading this and need help with some terms here:

- Fud (fear, uncertainty and doubt) for example spreading negative news articles like ""Bitcoin doomed to drop to $1000 in 2020"". People often say Bitcoin is dying as a way of scaring others into not investing, however the people who say it 1. Are uneducated on how Bitcoin works and the whole point of it, or 2. Have ulterior motives (eg. Peter Schiff spreads fud as he sells gold for a living, and people often say Bitcoin is a better store of value than gold, thus making BTC his competition.)

- Fomo (fear of missing out) - noobs who want to own Bitcoin will see a sudden increase in value and think it's going to keep going and panic buy at a high price. For example, last night the price leapt to $9000. Noobs who haven't bought Bitcoin would think, ""I need to buy Bitcoin now or I'll miss out!"" buy at $9k, next day drops $100. Buy the dip, buy small amounts, NEVER buy on emotions or FOMO.

- Weak hands are usually the same noobs who fomo. They behave on impulse driven by emotions and often see Bitcoin as a get rich quick scheme and will panic buy/sell at the drop of a hat.

- Strong hands aka. HODLers (Hang On for Dear Life) ride the waves regardless of how high or low short-term the value is. It is best to invest long term and not get too upset with dips, see them as Bitcoin sales.

"1. There are a lot of exchanges. What country do you live in? If you live in the US, Coinbase is idiot proof.

2. The “best” wallet is probably running a Bitcoin Core node but that’s not recommended for new users. Trezor and Ledger are the most popular hardware wallets. Coinbase also has Coinbase Pro, which would be a more appropriate exchange if looking to make trades.

3. There are a few apps for your phone to check the price. Blockfolio is good. You don’t need to connect it to any other account.

"I suggest you check out the link in the sidebar for [buybitcoinworldwide.com](https://buybitcoinworldwide.com) . The best process will vary by person depending on individual requirements.

As far as the best wallet, the common wisdom is to use a hardware wallet like Trezor or Ledger.

For trading platforms, again it varies by personal requirements and preferences. If you use a centralised exchange you will most likely have to comply with KYC and supply identification, so if you don't like the idea of that then you should check out decentralised exchanges (DEXs). In general try to use a larger exchange with a positive track record with reasonable trading volume, instead of using a new small exchange just because they offer a slightly better price. This should reduce the risk of a bad experience.

For monitoring, coinmarketcap is good for the market  prices, and there are a lot of mobile app portfolio trackers such as Blockfolio and Delta.

I see what you're saying, but hasn't the market price been relatively uncoupled from the mining cost for a while now? It's a scarce asset, and most people just want it, and they don't know the first thing about mining.

">but that’s meaningless without making a judgment on where stability is occurring.

>for example if you overlap the total amount of mined bitcoin, over 50% of it was mined at a price point of <$50 which isn’t clear from this chart because it doesn’t show the totals tapering from halvings.

>It’s ridiculous to assert that with upcoming supply reduction there will be a price increase since there are plenty for sale now at well over the cost to mine.

Over 50% were mined at low price points because mining was far faster and easier when BTC was in it's infancy. After each halving event, the complexity and compute power required to mine grew exponentially higher as the rate of new BTC generation was cut in half, which is why only well-funded mining farms are able to successfully compete in the market now. Every time this has happened, the price has risen exponentially with the reduction in supply, which is why ""there are plenty for sale now at well over the cost to mine.""

Gotta love how inconsequential fringe groups think they represent “diversity.”

If you think 99% of the left OR right isn’t in lockstep over basic premises I have no idea what planet you’re on.

Past that the right has utilized the gun rights, jesus and coal/dinosaur mining as their pandering to the peasantry that allows them to somehow stay in power while being overlords. This is because the right celebrates tribalism while falsely pushing the “individual” narrative (ie left = anti-individual).

Yet the left is fractured because tribalism isn’t important and the actual process of populist approval occurs.

We distribute waste beyond the environments natural capacity for breaking it down.
We disrupt ecosystems and cause growing mass extinction.

The “nazis” narrative is just an attempt to stifle free thought by the left. Contrary to what many people think and what the fake media tells you, “tolerance and equality” may sound great but they are code words for authoritarian groupthink.

"The right does not care about freedom of speech, freedom of speech as it is used by the right today is used as a rhetoric tool meaning that the state should support white supremacy.

Same with the word freedom. The right does not care about freedom that doesn't subtract from other people's freedom, such as abortion. In fact they are against it.

What they mean with freedom, is the freedom to exploit workers, forbid unionization, pollute without accountability, be free from taxes (prohibits social mobility), be free of democracy (because it's inefficient and the totalitarian China model is much more efficient).

They are for freedoms that subtract from other people's freedoms. The left on the other hand is by definition not as well organized, because the incentives are much more diverse and that means there's less money to organize and synchronize in the way the right does. The right pours hundreds of millions into think thanks to craft coherent and easily digestible messages for the public.

Historical Global Tropical Cyclone Landfalls*
July 2012
Jessica Weinkle
Center for Science and Technology Policy Research, University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado

“The analysis does not indicate significant long-period global or individual basin trends in the frequency or intensity of landfalling TCs of minor or major hurricane strength. The evidence in this study provides strong support for the conclusion that increasing damage around the world during the past several decades can be explained entirely by increasing wealth in locations prone to TC landfalls, which adds confidence to the fidelity of economic normalization analyses.”

"There are always tradeoffs . In terms of security and  privacy the best wallets are hardware wallets with full nodes so you use a hw wallet + electrum personal server + electrum. This is more complicated to use for most people though so some other recommendations. 

**Best wallets for securing small amounts of BTC**

**electrum** For Desktop and Android

Pros= Great Desktop and Android wallet with advanced functionality like coin control 

Cons= UX is not as polished as some other wallets, make sure you only upgrade from official sources like play store or https://electrum.org as malicious servers or adverts can tell you to upgrade malware from other sites

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4EhZg5QslI

**Éclair ** LN wallets for Android and desktop

Pros- Lightning network integration(as well as onchain) allowing you to spend with LN merchants for instant confirmations and much lower fees

Cons- Lightning is still somewhat experimental ,Some users may want to use other LN wallets. http://lightningnetworkstores.com/wallets

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq4lF2s4UtI


https://acinq.co


**Blockstream Green Wallet** IOS and android wallet

Pros- Great UX, easy hardware wallet and full node integration, RBF, HW wallet support and advanced 2fa options
Cons- Until single signature is released 2 of 2 multisig means that one must depend upon blockstream’s server for tx signing. Other light wallets are dependent upon other servers as well but light wallets like electrum allow you to swap servers.

"The issue is this: setting up RoninDojo requires additional work and technical knowledge. Even further, once you set it up you NEED to create a new wallet, and never use the one that was first created when you booted up the samurai software (because that one is already doxxed to the samurai servers). 

Considering the ‘average user’, we should expect that the majority of people do not do this. Most just install the app on their phone and then start checking out the ‘privacy features’. 

So let’s say you set up RoninDojo, which is great right? Except now you engage in a coinjoin, and each other user in it isn’t running dojo.

"Ledger's recommendation makes OP directly at risk of losing funds if the burglars know what they have in hands, mine delays it proportionally to the length of the chosen passphrases.

I'm not sure why Ledger calls it an advanced feature honestly, maybe they think it's too hard for people to properly store an additional 4-6 words in a different location? In this case why isn't it already too hard for them to store the first 24 words properly? As we can see people to get their seed stolen during burglaries.

Anyways if you intend to improve your cold storage it's not such an ""advanced"" security measure to put in place.

Second, what happens at 3:19:02 when the buying stops? You think one big move of $50 in price (100 million dollars invested btw, 100 bucks for 1 million little fishies) won’t get sold off by the first whale to understand it isn’t a sustainable rally?

Lastly, encouraging this isn’t encouraging any meaningful adoption of bitcoin at all, it’s just hopium that it will get the price to rise with respect to fiat currencies.

The last point is the most important because it means anyone who thinks this is a good idea hasn’t fully grasped how much potential bitcoin really has.

"well for starters, trying to get enough people to do it is a start, that's why i posted this as high as i was Lol 

Second, with the amount of people i was proposing, what is the likely hood, well lets say, the 1.3 million members here would have finished the sale in 2 seconds taking into consideration the human element not to mention computer lag times and server issues that would dramatically slow it down, so it would be a sustained volume increase for a significant amount of time, and then you have the potential buyers who would see the price going up and catch the ride up including a lot of legitiment investors, and practically anyone who deals with bit coin would jump on the wagon as soon as they see the price rising, so it would be an even longer sustained volume increase, probabaly lasting the whole week.

Lastly, but not lastly, i know this isn't encouraging any meaningful implementation of the blockchain and bitcoin itself for what its worth, but what these exchanges are doing is fraud and they are ruining bitcoin for the rest of the people who actually want to see new people get into cryptocurrency and have the world adopting the blockchain for everything from healthcare, to vehicle titles, house deeds, property etc.

now the last point, is not the most important because you are completely wrong, sort of, i have not fully grasped the potential of the blockchain technology, i don't think anyone has, but i have grasped it just as much as the next guy. I don't think anyone can fully grasp the potential of it because the ideas its capable of haven't even been thought of yet , i mean the possibilities and the good it can do is endless.

the main point of what i was saying wasn't even the plan thing idk what to call it, it was the fact that we the people have the power over bitcoin and we get to decide what the price is.

We lost control over our government, our political system, our rights, our money, our privacy, our wages, our dignity, our sense of self worth, our property, pretty much anything you can think of. Thats what the blockchain is all about right? giving the power back to the people? were ruining the whole concept of bitcoin by letting exchanges and whales manipulate the price of the peoples coin for their own profits, Just like the banking system did to fiat, and frankly, sadly enough I see bitcoin going down the same path where the people aren't going to do a damn thing one the blockchain gets taken over by the same people we are trying to avoid. and it scares the living hell out of me that the one damn good thing that's has came to the people in forever is going to be stolen from us before we ever get a chance to use it with it actually being beneficial to us, THE PEOPLE.

"What is Money? And Could Bitcoin Be the Best One? | Jad Mubaslat | TEDxDayton (Jan 2020)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vROTmMzJnXk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vROTmMzJnXk) 

 If you’ve heard that Bitcoin is going to revolutionize money, but aren’t quite sure what that means, this talk is for you. Bitcoin entrepreneur and enthusiast Jad Mubaslat explains the key features of what makes anything (whether it is precious metals, paper notes, shells, or cows) viable as a currency for exchanging value. He then lays out how a digital currency like Bitcoin has all the same features necessary to be a currency, with some additional advantages that are unique to the blockchain technology upon which Bitcoin is built. Jad Mubaslat has been passionate about Bitcoin for several years. He founded BitQuick.co while attending The Ohio State University in 2013. The Bitcoin trading platform was accepted into leading Bitcoin accelerator, Boost.VC in 2014; BitQuick.co was then later acquired in 2016.

"High-volume bitcoin selling within minutes is a blatant attempt to depress the price - likely by legacy financial or government related entities.
A seller willfully leaves money on the table by ""dumping"" in minutes - rather than slowly selling into the market over days or weeks.  Unless public market or policy event has triggered the sale.  If a seller has inside knowledge but its not public - it would still be more profitable to liquidate slowly.

If there is any chance that your ex-friend has seen your 12 words, I would transfer the funds to a new seed asap. To do this create a new wallet with a new 12 or preferably 24 words, and then send your funds to the Bitcoin receive address for that new wallet. Suggest send a very small amount first and make sure that you have received it at the new wallet before sending the rest. Once your funds are secure at the new wallet you can then consider plans on how to sell it when the time comes.;2;0;False;E-renter;fewkjmu;dont know how to sell my bitcoin!!;eqrgis;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/eqrgis/dont_know_how_to_sell_my_bitcoin/
"You can use any of a number of wallets to recover the wallet: the words have been standardized and most wallets support it.  I recommend using Electrum.

A somewhat long string starting with ""bc1""?  That's Native SegWit.  Or just recover all three and see which one has funds.

Note that your friend might have copied the 12 words, in which case he or she could have already taken the funds.  If you are unsure, you might be better off making a new wallet in Electrum and sending it there if you still have access to the funds, meaning a new set of 12 words.

If you are looking to Sell bitcoin for fiat money, then the methods available will differ based on a few factors:

- Where are you located (country)?
- How much are you looking to sell?
- What methods of payment will you accept?
- How soon do you need access to the proceeds?
- Is financial privacy important?

When selling on P2P trading exhcanges, payment methods include where the buyer deposits cash in your bank account, or transfers the funds to your account.  Know that there are risks in being defrauded when using bank transactions for Bitcoin trading, but if your buyer has a long and excellent trust history the risks are much lower.

*P2P Trading Exchanges*

And finally, some Bitcoin ATMs are not just bitcoin vending services, but also are 2-way, (i.e., dispenses cash):

"If you are looking to Buy bitcoin with fiat money, then the methods available will differ based on a few factors:

- Where are you located (country)?
- How much are you looking to buy?
- What payment methods do you have available?
- How soon do you need access to the proceeds?
- Is financial privacy important?

Here's a useful comparison of exchanges in which you can filter on payment method:

- https://exchangewar.info  <-- Filter box for currency (e.g., EUR) or payment method (e.g., VISA)

Otherwise, an in-person cash trade or an online trade using a P2P trading exchange may possibly be your next best option:

*P2P Trading exchanges*

- [Person-to-person (P2P) Trading Exchanges](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/dyclf8)
- https://exchangerates.pro  <-- Choose country and/or Payment Method

Using gift cards, there is [CardCoins](https://www.cardcoins.co) for paying with a non-reloadable, prepaid GIFT card (VISA/Mastercard/AMEX/Discover),  [CryptoVoucher.io](https://cryptovoucher.io) for paying with gift cards for numerous brands, [Redeem](https://www.redeeem.com/gift-cards), and [BitOf](https://bitof.io/) for paying with Amazon UK gift cards).


First time buyers may like the convenience of an online store that sells bitcoin and accepts debit and/or credit card. I do not know which ones require ID verification/KYC beyond those marked as such. (e.g., [Switchere](https://switchere.com) [**NO-KYC**], [Rebiton](https://rebiton.com) [**NO-KYC**], [CoinCorner](https://coincorner.com) [[💳](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card)] [**NO-KYC** when £900 or less], [CEX.io](https://CEX.io.com), [Coinify](https://www.coinify.com), [Paybis](https://paybis.com), [Jubiter](https://app.jubiter.com/neworder/buy), [Bittylicious](https://bittylicious.com), [BitIreland](https://bitireland.ie), [Kuna.io Money](https://money.kuna.io), [LiteBit.eu](https://www.litebit.eu/en/buy), [Conio.com](https://conio.com) App, [CryptoVoucher.io](https://cryptovoucher.io), [GetSatoshi.org](https://getsatoshi.org) ([⚡](https://lightningnetworkstores.com/wallets)), [Cash App](https://cash.app/bitcoin) and CoinMama). You can buy BTC on Cash App without ID but you won't be able to withdraw them until you are KYC verified.

There are physical locations where there are Bitcoin ATMs and other vending/voucher methods.  For example, in the U.S. there is:

- https://coinatmradar.com  <-- Some will require Identity verification/KYC, others just a phone number (e.g., CoinFlip ATMs, when $900 or less), or nothing at all
- https://www.coinstar.com/bitcoin (with [2,200+ locations in the U.S.](https://coinme.com/kiosks))  <-- Identity verification/KYC
- https://libertyx.com/a/buy/locations  <-- Cashier (cash), and/or Kiosk (debit card)
- https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/dabf2m  <-- Some will require identify verification/KYC, but not all will.

You can purchase online using a No-KYC online store, paying by depositing cash in a bank account or through Moneygram/Western Union:

Having multiple exchanges is good because certain exchanges, like Coinbase, do chiananalysis and could freeze your account if they see that coins you withdrew eventually end up for things like  online gambling/poker, dark markets, and more.

"**Credit card**

A credit card is a payment card issued to users (cardholders) to enable the cardholder to pay a merchant for goods and services based on the cardholder's promise to the card issuer to pay them for the amounts plus the other agreed charges. The card issuer (usually a bank) creates a revolving account and grants a line of credit to the cardholder, from which the cardholder can borrow money for payment to a merchant or as a cash advance.

A credit card is different from a charge card, which requires the balance to be repaid in full each month. In contrast, credit cards allow the consumers to build a continuing balance of debt, subject to interest being charged.

"Sure it'd be worth it to buy a small amount to play around with, especially if you're interested in the technology and want to learn more about Bitcoin. The best incentive to learn is if you actually own a small amount of it.

"Nobody knows the future price.

What you could do is follow Dollar Cost Averaging. That's where you spread your buys over a certain period of time. e..g, 5 months, you buy $20 each month, to get you investing your target of $100 (for an example).

If the exchange rate goes down from here, great, your average price for your position will be less than ~$9K per BTC. If the exchange rate goes up from here, great, you got at least some at ~$9K per, which you wouldn't have gotten had you sat on the $100 for five months and bought all at once then.

There's still the risk of it going down after you purchase, but this strategy is one that works for many who struggle with FOMO or who stress over trying to time the market.

For instance, on P2P Bitcoin trading exchanges, sellers charge a markup of a certain percent above spot price (e.g.,  6%).  They then replenish their inventory of bitcoin for sale using a traditional exchange, or other method of acquiring bitcoin at a price near spot price. 

Some traders even have offers for selling and buying, ... where their bid is a price several percent below spot.    Some payment methods include in-person cash, cash deposited in the seller's bank account, cash-in-the-mail, postal money order, or prepaid gift card.

>Everything that does not have value to you is a ponzi.   
 

It is not ""to me"".  

There is an **objective** difference between stocks,  bonds, real estate, commodities, on one hand; and pyramid schemes, MLM  schemes, ponzi schemes, penny stocks, and lottery tickets on the other.   

The former are concrete assets, that have a persistent, non-speculative demand and/or generate new wealth that returns to *all* investors, fairly split.  

The latter are just tokens, that stand for no assets and generate no  revenue; on the contrary, they only consume some of the investor's  money, and redistributes the rest among them, randomly and unevenly. 

Crypto scammers go to great lengths to keep their marks from  understanding that simple point.  They will say that all investments are  basically the same, that value is just market price, which is just a  matter of offer and demand.

>the discussion is whether you started telling people to not buy bitcoin at $10 or $1000.   
 

**I first heard about bitcoin sometime in 2013, bit only started paying  attention to it after the crash of Dec/2013.  So I have been telling  people to not buy bitcoin since it was $1000 or so.**  

And that was good advice.  People who bought at $10 only profited if  they sold for more than $10; people who bought at $1000 only profited if  they sold for more than $1000.  But did they?  

It is mathematically impossible for everybody to profit from bitcoin;  because the profit of one investor can come from only one place: the  loss of some other investor.  

If you believe in bitcoin enough to buy, you should not ever sell; on  the contrary, you should keep investing all the money you can spare.   That makes you a loser.  The only (almost) guaranteed winners in that  game are the miners.

Whenever someone boasts of having made a huge profit by buying a  bunch at $10 and selling at $1000, I ask how much MORE did he invest.   Quite often it turns out that, in total, he is still negative -- because  he invested all that he gained, and more, when it was $10'000, or  whatever.";1;0;False;michelmx;fezq7on;Can we pay some respects to our man Peter, missing out on Bitcoin since 2011.;eqpwit;https://i.redd.it/hdkc2zii2nb41.png

I also feel that /r/bitcoin is really not the smartest place to be around if you're into the topic but I cannot say this about other places on reddit. Everybody knows that there are other places to have discussions about cryptocurrencies like bitcointalk or the bitcoin mailing list. There are worse places like twitter. So whatever...

On to your arguments:

>Average Joe will never run a node, with the hashpower needed to compete.

Running a full node is a different thing than doing mining operations. You can run a full node without doing mining operations and a lot of people do run a full node (around 10,000). So your argument is fundamentally wrong from a technical standpoint. Running a full node doesn't add security by mining but it is greatly benefiting decentralization. There are some key benefits:   
1. More nodes directly mean more eyes on the code, especially in the early days of cryptocurrencies that we are in.  
2. Lightweight Nodes (SPV Wallets) connect to random nodes. The more nodes there are to connect to, the smaller the possibility to receive malicious packages  
3. By having full nodes and mining separated there is no clustering of full nodes besides mining industry and therefore no pressure on development by miners.

Running a full node comes with a cost. The average data consumption depends on what scenario you are running but it's between 500mb and 5gb per day of traffic. You need around 1-2gb of ram and about 200gb of hard disc capacity. 

While this does not sound much for developed western countries it's a lot for emerging markets. If you want to achieve best possible distribution and decentralization you need to include those markets. And 5gb/day for a two-way full node is also not a small number considering the fact that in some western countries ""Flatrates"" essentially mean something like 75-200gb/month of free traffic (landline).

>A world decentralized currency runs at 56k modem speed.

While I understand what you mean that still doesn't fit the picture. Bitcoin is running fine, it's predictable and there are very, very rare events of congestion. If you want to compare it you should compare it to something reasonable like the current state of the internet. Could be better, but isn't, there are some downtimes from time to time. Comparing it to 56kbit is simply over exaggerating. 

>$60/tx fees in 2017 Dec

That's the one event. There might have been another but since then everything is doing fine. There has been a lot of improvement since then to prevent this kind of event from occuring again. The most important technique is batching, which (if I recall correct) even coinbase haven't used back then. There is segwit for added block weight and bech32 for smaller transactions, things have improved a lot since then! Pointing back to one event over and over again is kinda unfair in my eyes when improvement is so obvious.

Increasing the blocksize would lead to fewer full nodes since you would need to have a ton more computing power to only be able to run the node the more you scale the blocks. Alone the needed bandwidth would soon require data center like capacities only miners could provide infrastructure for which leads to an increasing centralization as said before.

>The bankers win. Especially w/ them owning majority of Blockstream through AXA Group.

Blockstream is employing a handful Bitcoin Core developers but the vast majority of Bitcoin Core Contributers are in no way connected to Blockstream. It's a mistake to believe that Blockstream is able to manipulate the whole Bitcoin ecosystem.

>Only benefactor is the intelligence agencies that get the new prime numbers found.

SHA256 hashing on bitcoin has really nothing to do with generating prime numbers.

Bitcoin is nowhere near the stated 56kbit/s or 5kb/sec network bandwidth. It sounds made up by someone who doesn't understand the ecosystem or doesn't want to understand it because ""mine is better"". Scaling Bitcoin while still maintaining maximum decentralization is a key feature and it's an equilibrium that's very hard to balance. The ongoing stability proves that the current state is fine while there is room for improvement. Improvement is happening in a decentralized way and is not rushed by a centralized authority. There are scaling solutions that are built on top of Bitcoin seem to work fine for micropayments and smaller amounts. 

I'm still a fan of crypto. I believe in Bitcoin since it's developers and the community are plenty and thoughtful when you know where to look to.";1;0;False;palmino;ff0xj42;WE'RE BACK BABY;eqpgyn;https://i.redd.it/u049rwgtwmb41.jpg

I don't think this justifies their support team never once replying to my emails. I even had them translated to German.

They ignored me. Never once messaged me.

Never once. Zilch. They ignored every email I ever sent. Never once tried to determine if I was the rightful account holder, and I should be able to verify every bit of information they ask of me (as I am truthfully the actual account holder!). Wouldn't they try to contact the original account holder (which is me, so I know they haven't) before closing the account?

Even if they suspected fraud, the way they went about this is super shady.

"That’s fair, but I wouldn’t put Bitcoin in the same category of liquidity as fiat.  In fact, one of the main reasons that fiat is liquid is because of exactly what you said: it is expected to depreciate in value so it’s better to spend it than save it.  

As for Bitcoin I don’t think it makes sense to assign much of a liquidity premium to it.  For example, Bitcoin is probably less liquid than the SPY ETF for example (especially in large sizes).  So it’s fine to hold BTC, but you should be doing it for a return, not for liquidity.";1;1;False;CubsThisYear;fey372l;If you bought 100$ every month since ATH you would still be profitable!;eqo4rn;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/eqo4rn/if_you_bought_100_every_month_since_ath_you_would/
But it’s not a strategy, at least not a rational one.  If at some time, you want to allocate X% of your wealth to some asset, it makes no sense to allocate less than X% to that asset.  If the size of your portfolio stays constant and you are “doing DCA” then it means you are changing your asset allocation without your risk tolerance changing, which is weird and will produce sub-optimal returns on average.  If your portfolio size is increasing and you are keeping the allocation the same, then you aren’t “doing DCA” your just adding money to a given portfolio.;3;1;False;CubsThisYear;fey42pt;If you bought 100$ every month since ATH you would still be profitable!;eqo4rn;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/eqo4rn/if_you_bought_100_every_month_since_ath_you_would/
Sure that makes sense, but I don't think it's right to call that DCA.  Obviously you can't invest money you don't have.  When people say DCA I think there's a built in assumption that you are holding back capital you have in some other asset (e.g cash).  There isn't really a rational reason to do this.  It makes much more sense to pick an asset allocation and just add assets to your portfolio in proportion to that allocation.;2;0;False;CubsThisYear;feyubw2;If you bought 100$ every month since ATH you would still be profitable!;eqo4rn;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/eqo4rn/if_you_bought_100_every_month_since_ath_you_would/

It’s perfectly reasonable to say you want low variance in your portfolio (i.e don’t get poor), but Bitcoin seems like an odd choice for that.

"I'm not suggesting timing anything.

"> If you bought 100$ every month since ATH you would still be profitable!

Yep... Here's my table of data I pulled last week to confirm.

*****

I ran a simulation of performing DCA based on a ***start date*** going back 50, 100, 150... 1000 days.  Here are the results.  The simulation assumes a 0.50% taker fee on each buy and investing $1 a day.  You can simply multiply all by 20 to do $20 a day.  The ***min*** column assumes you bought at the worst time each day (24h high), and the ***max*** column assumes you bought at the best time each day (24h low).  The ***APR*** is what standard APR would be required to yield the same returns over the same period.  The brackets show that your final value is below the amount invested.

For example, if you would have started your DCA at the ATH (756 days ago) your would still have realized an 8-10% (apr) gain.  If you would have started at the 52w high (200 days ago), you would obviously still be underwater, but not by as much as most would expect.

It's an interesting example of how DCA can ""iron out"" some of the volatility.

Assuming a current BTC spot price of **8070.00** and that you ***started*** your DCA so many ***days ago***

Purchasing an asset on a regular schedule to smooth out the peaks and valleys (as opposed to trying to optimize purchases based on market prices) is the definition of DCA. That’s a more specific technique than “just investing” (whatever that means).;2;1;False;SteveTack;fewmffi;If you bought 100$ every month since ATH you would still be profitable!;eqo4rn;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/eqo4rn/if_you_bought_100_every_month_since_ath_you_would/
"DCA is an impressive exercise in mental gymnastics.  Let’s assume you have $10K to invest.  The optimal way to invest is to allocate all of that money in portfolio of assets (which might include BTC) in such a way that the covariance of those assets fits with your overall risk tolerance (i.e Modern Portfolio Theory).  Note that “not investing” a portion of it is not an option - it just means that your portfolio consists partly of fiat cash.

DCA is just a backwards way of saying you want to diversify your money partly in BTC and partly in fiat.  Except then you are also saying that you are going to continually rebalance your portfolio, even though your risk tolerance is presumably not changing.

Now, perhaps people are saying they are using DCA because they are investing income as they receive it, but that’s not really DCA, it’s just investing.
