"Up thousands of percent since I got in. Don't give any fucks about 60% drop.

You said: 
> Give it a day or two and the price will start creeping back to the $330s and beyond again.

You made the claim. We're here, and you're wrong. Just letting you know you were wrong. Suck it. Don't hate me because you were an idiot and called it wrong. This is 100% your fault.

"You realize bitcoin was the worst performing asset of 2014 right?  You realize that bitcoin performed worse than war zone currencies right?  You realize bitcoin performed worse than economies who are on the verge of collapsing right?  You realize bitcoin by definition is hyperinflated @ 60% loss for the year right?  

Oh but it gained $10 in the last  hour (and already lost $5 of the pump), so it's got that going for it which is nice.

Honestly just ignore me, you aren't even fun to troll because 1.) you are obviously 15 years old and 2.) you also obviously have some sort of mental disorder.

You can tell who's takes our trolling the hardest by who is the most euphoric when anything good happens to bitcoin.  As evidenced by you saving my comment and posting in buttcoin constantly: it's you!";-1;1;False;Rub3X;cmut3kl;You can now buy Xbox credit with Bitcoin;2oxkgr;http://imgur.com/p7J3P0K
