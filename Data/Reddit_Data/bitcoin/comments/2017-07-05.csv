No, he didn't want to connect from his home network as he knew the dangers. I remember reading that the FBI had matched the times when someone connected to their forum activity on onion sites so even if they can't see exactly what someone is doing they can use other methods. By the way I think we shouldn't need to use any browser for privacy, our internet history should only be accessible through a court order.
