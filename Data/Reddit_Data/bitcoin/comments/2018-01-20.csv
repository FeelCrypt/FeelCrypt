"sure, i show houses, and apt buildings, and commercial properties

in LA (one of the most expensive real estate markets in America)

so sure... if you consider that lowly, that only shows that you dont understand real estate

i mean you re aware that, at this very moment, the president of the USA is a man who made billions buying and selling real estate?

i'm not saying that i'm doing THAT well.  I dont make billions, but i do well.

but i'm sure you are doing soooo much better?

lol

i can basically guarantee that youre just talking shit as you sit back and collect your $15/hour minimum wage paycheck

hey, not that there is anything wrong with someone being an uber driver (any work is better than being on welfare or not working at all)

but youre a dude who drives uber and plays tons of video games, and you are acting like me buying, selling and investing in real estate is somehow beneath you

YOURE A FUCKING UBER DRIVER!

Take care of your own lack-of-a-career before you insult someone like me who actually has a career thats more than just being personal taxi to millenilas

"I hope you enjoyed venting, because your rant hasn't said anything of real substance.

I don't see how Ver has anything to do with this; he's just a dude that  I couldn't care less about.

There is no such thing as ""stealing resources"".  It's a democracy, so if people think the other tech is better, then they vote with their resources--it's not stealing; no one owes anyone anything.

Again, I don't care about Ver.  Bitcoin Cash is called Bitcoin Cash; it's terrifically hypocritical to be calling it ""BCash"" and then also bitch about Bitcoin Cash taking over the name ""Bitcoin"".

There is no such thing as a ""hostile"" takeover.  There is no army invading peoples' homes.  It's just voting, adoption, and tech.

I'm very well informed about what a 51% attack is, and I am also well informed about Big Blocks.  You should actually check out the research done by Stanford.  They got Gigabit blocks running in a distributed fashion on hardware that is no better than an average gaming computer.  Check it out if you're actually interested in learning.  It was Stanford research, not some guy in a basement.  I feel like that deserves some merit and respect.

Again, Ver.  I don't care.  You're calling things a scam that genuinely aren't, which dilutes the meaning of what a ""scam"" is.  It also makes you sound like a fearmonger and it makes you sound uninformed--relying too much on emotional arguments.

I already touched on the topic of ""theft"" or resources.  It's voting.

"Yes I understand that. And I really hope the guy gets his issue resolved. 

All I am saying in plain English is that the minute you deal with a crypto exchange you are taking a risk because you’ve trusted them to handle your money.

"One attempts such exactly like Ver, Jihan & Co have again and again.

Trying to steal the resources of an already established Open Source project, instead of producing their own.

Ver has zero claim to the name Bitcoin. Neither he nor his incompetent ""devs"" he has working for him have ever contributed one line of code to the Bitcoin project.

Ver just constantly tries to steal the name, offering one get-rich-quick scam after another.   BCash is just the latest in a long line of such scams: XT, Classic, Unlimited, and mixed up in Jihan's scams such as btc1, 2x...  none of which have anything to do with Bitcoin.  

Well, except they are hostile takeover attempts against it.   

Also, look up the very real threat of a 51% attack, which is why these gangsters have been denied their ""Big Blocks NOW!"" crap again and again, and will continue to be.

Ver, Jihan & Co produce nothing worthy. None of their scams can be considered bona fide altcoins.  They only try to steal the hard work of others, and profit from it by fooling people that don't know better.

Such shady theft of resources (name, symbols, and in this case, blockchain) is discouraged with extreme prejudice in all of Open Source, not just Crypto.

Your answer that points to me apparently saying that profitability is a trait of a currency:

>Bitcoin is not failing to be profitable, Bitcoin is failing to become an adopted currency...

This ignores context. Bitcoin is not failing to be profitable as an ASSET. This is what I previously said: ""[Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency] but it's technically a crypto-asset"". This entire thread focuses on how BTC isn't really a currency, and shares little traits with actual currencies. Profitability being not it.
