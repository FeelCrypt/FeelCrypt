Similar to you, my Bettrex account no longer functions as it did last week. I've had the account since early 2016. Day before yesterday, 11.11.17, suddenly I can not withdraw any of my coins without verifying my account. My account has been labeled as NEW. My ID/pw combo works for me to access the account but does NOT work to reach tech support. Also, my trading history before June, 2017 has disappeared.

"Stopping mining would decrease the number of miners and hashes, thus increasing mining fees, making it more lucrative to mine.

Additionally, if demand for coins continued to rise (which will happen as long as there are new people who find utility in BTC) without miners mining more coins (static supply), then, again, mining becomes more lucrative.

All in all, if the price is dropping, miners might stop as a result. But miners will never stop to *make the price drop* because it wouldn't work that way and they'd lose money.";1;0;False;CDanger;dpser2s;Please take a moment to thank Slush.

"Yeah but you're missing my point :) So say I'm the exchange, and you want to short. I sell you futures with a strike price of 3000$. That means I win if the price goes up, and you win if the price goes down. However, I'm a bank, I don't want any unnecessary risk - in fact I don't even know or care how bitcoin goes. I want to make a small profit regardless of how bitcoin moves. So I need to hedge. How do I do it? Don't answer that I should be willing to find someone who wants long futures - then I'm just matching two people and they're doing a bet about the future price of bitcoin - which will obviously have zero impact on the price.

No there is only one solution for me to hedge my futures position as a bank. I need to find someone who is willing to lend me bitcoin, so that I can sell them at market price. If the price goes down - fine I'll buy back the bitcoins I borrowed at a cheaper price and the difference goes to paying the guy with the future contract. If the price of bitcoin up - fine I'll buy back the bitcoins I borrowed at a higher price, and use the profits I made from the guy with the futures to pay of the difference. Hence - it's a hedge.

"I would say the same thing. That is the whole point of this methodology. You don't know if it will keep going down and if it does, you should have faith for the price to go up seeing as you bought it in the first place.  The point is that when you buy some Bitcoin or even common stocks, you only have limited downside potential (Bitcoin going to zero meaning you lose everything you put in) but you have unlimited upside potential (Bitcoin going ""to the moon""). If you believe in the potential of Bitcoin and the price seems reasonable at current levels then you should buy ""at the market"". If you don't think it has potential then you shouldn't buy it anyway. 

If Bitcoin kept going down then it doesn't matter because you bought Bitcoin on the basis that you think the price will go up. When it does, the momentary loss between when Bitcoin kept going down below your market price will still be insignificant to would could occur if the price increases. It's just a small price to pay to make sure you bought in at all. 

It's always better to just buy in if you believe the price is fair instead of trying to time the ""most optimal"" buying point. ";2;1;False;Wackky42;dps4oyb;To everyone who bought in the dip...;7cl909;https://i.redd.it/1ex0gcm7qoxz.jpg

I not sure how it works, but if they set at 30%-40% captial requimrnet for opening a postion, they don't need to hedge the position in a liquid market?
