"With Bitcoin, there is 3 possible kinds of ""upgrades"", each with a different difficulty of being realized. In all cases multiple people are involved, anyone can propose changes, anyone is free to accept or refuse changes.

* \[EASY\] non-consensus based upgrades: these do not require to change the underlying rules of the network, and rather just build other layers on top of the existing infrastructure. A few people can accept to use it and it'll work without needing approval from everyone. (example: Lightning Network)
* \[MODERATE/HARD\] consensus upgrades with backward compatibility: you need to have a majority of users to agree to the change. But reaching that majority can be progressive since it's backwards compatible and won't affect users that do not upgrade immediately. (example: Segwit)
* \[NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE\]: non backward compatible consensus upgrades: aside from a few bug fixes in the early days (when barely a handful of geeks used Bitcoin), these have never been successfully achieved on the grown up Bitcoin network as it is today. These require everyone to agree at the same time to the new rules.

"I disagree, but I always enjoy having the discussion.  It depends on how much SHTF we are talking.

We've been through economic collapse before.  The Great Depression was really, really bad.  Overwhelming unemployment, long hungry lines at the soup kitchen, the masses were dirty & hungry and utterly poor.

And yet, society did not degenerate into a murderous wasteland with blood & ammo as the new currency.

All around the world, even today, we point to examples of collapsing economies (Venezuela, Greece).  And furthermore, there are examples of countries with *hundreds of millions* of people living in extreme poverty (India).  

Yet none of them has turned into a Mad Max anarchic wasteland.  By and large, most every person just wants to live a safe & peaceful life with a full belly.  There are so many stages of Recession & Depression before it ever hits the point of murdering your neighbor in cold blood for a tomato.  

That being said, the most likely scenario IMHO, is a period more similar to the Depression.  Our unthinkable $21T debt will eventually be defaulted, probably after another major disaster destroys $2T of Florida coastline that FEMA can't cover.  

The exchange rate of the USD takes a plummet, and the costs of every imported item (& the products produced from them) increase in price.  Especially oil, and everything that depends on it.  Meanwhile the values of our exports plummet, consumer spending halts, businesses begin to close up.  Unemployment skyrockets, and those who are lucky enough to keep jobs will certainly not be expecting a raise to cover the increased cost of living expenses.  And as tax revenues are decimated, social relief programs struggle to cover the growing number of poor.

This is the point in time where you liquidate your gold, silver, bitcoin, or any non-USD valuables into whatever currency on Earth is still stable.  And you get on a plane to that country and leave the rest behind.

When it comes to refugees, there are the ones that show up hungry & penniless, and then there are the ones that show up with a chest full of silver & local currency.  I plan to be the latter.

The economy back home will slowly recover as society adapts to a lifestyle less dependent on oil & cheap imports, and more dependent on local agriculture & sustainability.  Other countries see the fantastic labor rates they can get by outsourcing labor to the US, and slowly, very slowly, the money comes back.

"Once again bitcoiners focus on one small area of the economy and say hey we can do it different but don’t consider that the entire thing is a machine with many moving parts.

How is money loaned out in this new world? How is rate of interest on that money regulated? How is the inflation of the currency controlled to be try and sit around 2%? How does the government create mass funds to pay for its various projects? What is the new version of government bonds and treasuries? How I do ensure I’m taxing people and companies according to the profit or income they are generating? While taking into account the costs of business etc.? How do I tax the billionaire buying his 10th property differently from the guy buying his one and only place?

There’s so much to an economy you are completely ignoring. A sales tax on every transactions could never work, the system is 100 times more complicated than that.

Plus there is literally no international incentive to innovate from the current oil based model... only make small incremental change in the name of TV ads and hippies feeling better about buying from shell... In an economy based around kilowatt hours the incentive becomes to produce as many as possible as cheaply as possible, which means solar farms, wind turbines, etc, because they produce more efficient power than their peterol counterparts, if you actually look at the argument, a Resource based economy based on kilowatt hours essentially cuts out the petrol middle man while still allowing them to participate in the economy they were removed from the center of, the fed could quite possibly remain intact, even the name dollar, but we could literally sign an executive order tomorrow to change the base of the dollar from us treasury notes to kilowatt hours and not that much would change except the  incentive behind economic mobility. See the ubi argument is optional as is the possibility for a centralised crypto currency as well as my personal beef with property taxes, much like the argument for universal health insurance is separate from the 15 dollar minimum wage argument while sharing the same purpose of aiding in the elimination of poverty. The kilowatt dollar is a sudo-fiat currency by nature even though it is still classified as a Resource based currency. This is something that is kind of hard to wrap your head around till you think about it: For Example, the United States has a oil reserve, which they use to influence the price of oil at any given time, the fed sets interest rates based on ""the economy"" basically wether or not the country is on a downswing or an up swing, and this basically determines wether or not someone who is stably employed can get that new Camaro or not, in a kilo watt dollar economy the very same institutions could halt or ramp up state production of electricity, with the obvious effect being that more/less demand would fall on the private sector which would cultivate growth instead of the economy over taking regulation like some form of carnivorous weed in a field of wheat.

I agree with some points, but honestly you could just create a centralized crypto currency with a tax algorithm built in all trades. This is how I think the future of crypto will look. Decentralized coins are the future of the black market and would have only perceived value compared to the gaurenteed value of a centralized crypto currency. Now while I do think that this model is the future, it is not, in my opinion, the *best* model. I think that a resource based economy using kilowatt hours is the best, because in a system like that wealth creation would come in the form of either, burning fossil fuels *OR* creating renewable resources. Now, hear me out on this, your house, car, phone, etc, would still cost a similar amount and wealth earned would be 100% different than wealth created, the only difference is in this economic model wealth would be very easily created on an individual basis as well as a country/city/state/corporate level, and as such would be proportionate to the magnitude of these institutions. It would make things like say Wall Street less of an economic engine for the entire economy and more of a casino with only minor economic implications because well the base economy is electrical and wealth can be literally harvested like crops by everyone while at the same time it can also be earned at jobs in stocks through interest (which would actually make way more sense than charging interest in an economy with limited resources like in our current oil based economy because there is always more sunlight to be harvested). If you want a new economic model based on capitalism that actually has a chance of solving Climate change, there you go. It's a resource based economy that would use either a traditional journalling system or well a crypto based depending on which ever one is chosen to journal the economy. Plus if you think about it there are historical presidents for changing out economic engines, with less and less tangible things as societies progress, with the latest example being an economy based entirely on oil trade deals which is destroying the planet, whereas when the economy was based on gold there simply put wasn't enough of it to keep up with the population, with an economy based on kilowatt hours the engine would be scaleable based on value creation. For example say every human builds a solar panel or even one every so often, etc, they are creating little value in this system, but considering most people won't, economy forms because john has electricity and dave needs it so dave has john compile a software that moves the solar panel to different angles at different times of day in exchange for a percentage of daves kilowatt hours, believe it or not this would be able to run the entire economy because the typical problem of endless grouth is dealt with by having a near infinite resource, the economy would always be considered growing because the energy harvested every day would theoretically always be increasing and the market would be fairly balanced on supply and demand sides because demand would scale the economy, making solar mining either profitable or unprofitable given the exchange rates of solar cells to kilowatt hours. Something like universal basic income would theoretically be possible in this scenario because it's existence would percipatate exchange in the economy. Wealth would change, from a number in a bank to an accumulation of electrical influence, wether that be in the form of stocks or boats or land or food, or other resources because in this economy wealth accumulation comes in the form of batteries not paper, so as the phrase goes you have to spend electricity to make electricity which would give a great incentive for immediate reinvestment creating a fluid economy that works more like a radiator than an engine.;5;1;False;isflerganaword;e7iifnc;Hmm...;9mtjva;https://i.redd.it/ncktmkc5g8r11.png

Just a statement. You can take that as an attack.  Putin is expected to have over $200 billion in assets alone. Bitcoin market cap is $250 billlion. If these guys got together, they could control this market with ease. Probably by controlling a tiny fraction of the market cap.

Keep in mind that it took a long time for bitcoin to become what it is today (and there is even more to come in the future). This timeline is inconsistent with a quick money-grab game played by institutions, however, they do like the long-con to. But even if they created it, control over bitcoin is out of their hands now, that is kind of the whole point of a decentralized ledger. Whoever created it does not matter, it exists and that matters. Nobody can control it, nobody can steal it, nobody can, even not the 'putative' creator(s) of BTC.
