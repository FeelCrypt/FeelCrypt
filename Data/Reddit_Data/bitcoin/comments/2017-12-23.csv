"> I understand your point and that's definitely the case today, but all the hype has been based on the fact that in the future, bitcoin can stabilize at a higher number due to its limited amount. So if at some point in the future it becomes the most widespread cryptocurrency, the value will need to go up to spread it out among so many more people.

Even *if* the price stabilizes, and there's little reason to think it will because it is entirely unregulated, the other problems I listed still remain. And thsoe problems, fees and transaction times, only get worse as more people adopt it. 

> But regardless, that's not relevant. The fact that you are saying you don't know when the bubble will burst is my point. I personally think it will eventually come, but that doesn't mean there isn't room to profit. If the price keeps going up for all of 2018 and then people sell then, can you really criticize them? ""It's dangerous and you could have also lost your money instead."" Well... yeah... it's volatile and they are taking a risk, but I don't see the value in saying ""It's a stupid investment because it's a bubble."" It clearly has the potential to go up in value and sold at a higher value, so what's the problem?

Google ""greater fool theory."" If you're investing solely under the hope that the price will continue to irrationally inflate, well, you're not investing. You're gambling. Pretty inefficient gambling at that. I can wait, at the very least, weeks for my money double with bitcoin, or I can place one bet on a football game and double it in 2 hours. And at least with football one can use some knowledge of the teams to find a weakness in the line. Gambling with btc is just blindly hoping that people will continue to dump money into it. It's musical chairs. And with most bubbles, there are FAR more losers than winners. 

But yes, if you go in with the awareness that you're gambling and not investing, that IS better. That should mean A) you're consistently realizing profits by selling, and B) you only have a tiny fraction of your portfolio in it. I understand the temptation to hop on the money train, and I sort of considered throwing a little money at it, but I figured the amount of money I'd be willing to lose on bitcoin isn't even worth the time. The only way to make a significant amount of money is to toss an irresponsible amount on it. 

> It seems like a lot of people who spend time arguing against it are bitter that they missed out, and feel like they are being wronged for taking what feels like an intelligent approach in identifying it as a bubble, but then seeing other people make massive profits off their investment.

Lol, this is a classic line used by bitcoin people but it doesn't hold any water. Do you see the same arguments made against Amazon, Apple, Tesla, etc? If I bought Tesla stock at the beginning of 2013, I'd have nearly 10x that amount one year later. Same story is true for most of us, we don't own Tesla stock by and large. Do you see hoards of people shitting on Tesla? No, because the value is clearly there. I didn't get rich off Tesla, but I recognize its value. 

> I was never bitter towards other people because I gave them credit for identifying the potential and capitalizing, but I certainly did feel annoyed as I watched what I missed out on. So I know there are going to be people like me, but who are also bitter about the fact that they couldn't make 10x their money in such a short period of time.

Silly mindset to have. There are countless opportunities to get rich super rich off investments. Companies shoot up in valuation all the time. Like I said, look at Amazon. If you bought shares for $5 a piece in '98, you'd have 220x that amount now. But how many people is that true for in reality? Bezos and a handful of others totaling under 10? It's fucking hard to find the investment that's gonna blow up, and even harder to know if you're selling at the right time. The majority of people who poured a shit ton of money into a dot com stock in the late 90s? They went broke. And if you got lucky and picked Amazon, you probably sold well before it even hit $100, let alone $1100. Or maybe they sold when it was back down to under $10 in the early 2000's. You just don't know. 

The point is, you have to be incredibly lucky, and in most cases reckless, to get rich off a speculative investment. It's not much different then Vegas, where for every big winner there's a hundred degenerates who lost everything. 

> What happened is real. People invested money, eventually pulled that money out, and had way more than they did before. And the whole time they were doing that, I was saying ""Nah it's a bubble, and I don't think it will go any higher than this."" Assuming I'm right that it is a bubble, those people who made a ton of money don't give a shit. People can call bitcoin monopoly money all they want, but the fact is that money can be put in, grow, and then pulled out, even if it does come at a big risk that can come crashing down even harder than how wildly it went up.

Yeah and gambling is real too. People really do get rich from it. And I'm happy for those people. But I would never call gambling a wise investment. ";1;0;False;Smooth_On_Smooth;drn28w8;Bitcoin today;7le7t9;https://v.redd.it/kvztwkfpqd501

">Literally none of those are an advantage for an average consumer though. Especially when you consider transactions are free for the consumer using a credit card (in nearly all scenarios). Also most of those don’t exist yet, credit cards will advance as well so it’s not really fair to compare the future to the present. At the end of the day you can’t get something adopted by the public if it’s only useful to a select 10 people who want to write money applications with nano transactions.  Why would that convince the average person to switch for buying their Starbucks? 

Refer to the internet. I have a message forum I set up for about 20 friends. I'm sure a similar argument was made for making a website for such a small amount of people when news stations clearly do a better job.

As for free credit card use, gas stations give discounts when you pay with cash. Same logic would apply.

What would convince the average person to use crypto? How about a 5% discount and a rewards program that uses blockchain references for tracking orders?

>The advantages they get today with credit cards:
>-interest free loan for 30 days

Sure, that's really nice. Credit cards aren't cash though.

>- cash back in purchases 

Gas station gives me more than 4% discount for paying in cash, and most cards don't give that type of cash back bonus (aside from moments where they give it for a month or two to get me into the habit of using the card regularly)

>- 0 liability fraud protection 

Like when someone steals your credit card and spends it? I put a pin on my mycellium wallet and it protects that can of worms from every being opened. As for situations with chargebacks, you could build a multisig wallet where a third party can verify the situation. Thing is, we could do a lot more than leaving it in the hands of the same company controlling the financial exchange.

>- security of funds (you can lose your card and nothing happens)

I can lose my phone right now and nothing happens. I have my backup keys securely stored.

>- other benefits like warranties, travel, etc

Warranties are now attached to the blockchain. A company provides their receiving address, and signs a message with the terms of the warranty. Also, the tech is only 8 years old. These solutions will be developed. The other rewards are from the merchant fees attached to the card, and the selling of user data.

>- building your credit to help you get a loan in the future 

I can still take loans and build credit. Car loan, credit cards where I use crypto to pay the monthly bill, etc.

>- all of this is completely free and often comes with a signup bonus as well as software that makes it much easier to document your spending

Give it time. I'm confident these things will develop over time.

>How are you going to convince people to give all that up en masse?

How do businesses convince people to pay in cash? Find a healthy, mutually beneficial medium where you both win on your terms, as opposed to the credit card company strong arming the terms and conditions once they gain market dominance.

You're acting like the credit card industry could never lose influence in the world, ever. If that's the case, put your money where your mouth is and invest in them for long-term gains. It's a surefire win according to your assessment.

"For reference, I'm European and we don't do the whole ""war on drugs"" in my country.

And you're missing my point. Correct, decriminalization of drugs won't make more drugs available. Trafficking drugs now, today, and selling drugs, today, is in no way a victimless crime. It costs many innocent people their life's both directly and indirectly. 

A decriminalization will not make government spending necessarily larger or smaller, that's not so easy to define.

My point was, that dealing drugs is not victimless. People have died along the way, before the drugs hit the consumer, and many consumers are pushed into criminal activities to finance their use of substances, because prices are high due to the risk the sellers are taking.

"If you're unaware of the brutal history that fueled the expansion of gold and silver metals after the columbus voyage to ""the new world"" I would encourage you to do some investigation.

Certainly mining gold doesn't *require* classic notions slavery (even if the conditions people work in are hardly different), but there's plenty of motivation to deny gold miners any sort of rights to acquire gold with as much return as possible. It would behoove you to research mining conditions in africa and south america, or anywhere at any point in time when unions weren't or aren't a thing.

So correction: gold mining only requires slavery under highly exploitative systems such as capitalism that seek to ensure the highest return possible on all investments at the expense of others.

"youve got it backwards. currencies and stocks are people simply agreeing.  bitcoin and cryptocurrency actually provide *real* utility.

I agree bitcoin itself may seem ineffective at its purpose currently, but the foundation of its economy is its utilitarian and technological value.

Bitcoin was the first, and it has a stranglehold on the market, and perhaps it will have the best innovation and stay on top for quite a while.  There are many alt coins that serve bitcoins initial purpose better than bitcoin at this point.....

Anyhow the point is that cryptocurrency's value has a *real* foundation while fiats value, and even stocks(as they dont directly serve a purpose, merely represent an ethereal ownership of a company with which most people can do nothing) have less intrinsic value than any functioning crytpocurrency. in the future i imagine most finance will be hosted on any number of blockchains.

- building your credit to help you get a loan in the future

"I always see this argument on here about how “the internet will replace money” internet internet internet. That’s the point in trying to make with credit cards, the internet already has replaced money. That’s what credit cards are, leveraging technology to make money better. People on this reddit seem to think bitcoin is like investing in google in the 90s and they are seeing the effects of tech on finance before it happens. It has already happened!

What you are seeing here is a digital replacement for cash, but cash has already been replaced by credit. You’re replacing something nobody really uses anymore. 

As for your 4% back at gas stations, taking away for the moment that there are cards that do that, at the end of the day, because cards are run on tech, and block chain is just tech, there is no reason to believe that banks can’t make credit card transaction fees just as low as bitcoin fees. Hell, they could implement their own block chain and use that. Banks are still in the old phase of credit cards, everything is still in on premise servers for the most part. When that stuff all moves to the cloud there will be immense savings. 

And I think you missed the point on some of those advantages. 0% liability is more than being able to freeze your card. It means that that $200 purchase that was made so that you even realize that you need to freeze your card is now not your problem. Chase pays for it/calls the police over it/ etc. They do all the legwork. Same with the interest free loan, the warranty extension, etc. Those are all services that cost money that are being provided by an institution. If you want any of that with bitcoin you will need some institution to do it, and then voila, you’ve got a bank. 


Edit:

I’d also like to point out the scale differences. Right now you’re seeing like 300,000ish transactions per day on bitcoin and the system is in crisis. Fees are insanely high and times are long. Credit cards do over 1000 times that many transactions per day, fulfill in seconds, and cost a tiny amount relatively. And all of that is running on 20 year old mainframe technology.

While gold can't really be destroyed without a particle accellerator, a PC can be destroyed pretty easily. Data loss can happen even if you're trying to back it up.

">I always see this argument on here about how “the internet will replace money” internet internet internet. That’s the point in trying to make with credit cards, the internet already has replaced money. That’s what credit cards are, leveraging technology to make money better.

That's like saying your ISP free email account is the end-game of the internet. The true innovation happens when anyone can innovate on the edge and not seek permission from the big companies.

>What you are seeing here is a digital replacement for cash, but cash has already been replaced by credit. You’re replacing something nobody really uses anymore. 

Cash is used quite a bit. Being simple, anonymous and frictionless is valuable. You can't buy things from me via credit card without me accepting the Visa terms and agreements. Venmo will eventually switch to a transaction fee system.

>As for your 4% back at gas stations, taking away for the moment that there are cards that do that, at the end of the day, because cards are run on tech, and block chain is just tech, there is no reason to believe that banks can’t make credit card transaction fees just as low as bitcoin fees. Hell, they could implement their own block chain and use that. Banks are still in the old phase of credit cards, everything is still in on premise servers for the most part. When that stuff all moves to the cloud there will be immense savings. 

Show me a free card that gives 4% or more cash back every day and I'll sign up for that card today.

As for the blockchain, you wouldn't be able to tap into it without their permission. I want to be able to tap into a blockchain without permission, guidelines, developer fees, etc.

Credit cards cannot make fees as low as Bitcoin fees in a sufficiently optimized scenario because banks want profits. Bitcoin is a truly non-profit bank system that works globally.

>And I think you missed the point on some of those advantages. 0% liability is more than being able to freeze your card. It means that that $200 purchase that was made so that you even realize that you need to freeze your card is now not your problem. Chase pays for it/calls the police over it/ etc. They do all the legwork. Same with the interest free loan, the warranty extension, etc. Those are all services that cost money that are being provided by an institution. If you want any of that with bitcoin you will need some institution to do it, and then voila, you’ve got a bank. 

I don't need that if I'm the only authorized user to use my Bitcoin wallet. Credit card theft exists because you're literally using the password for the account in the open, for all to see. In Europe they use chip & pin, and a lot less fraud happens as a result. In the US, it is more profitable to avoid using the link because it means more profits for credit card companies, as forgetting your pin means you can't buy anything. The fraud prevention is just the cost of doing business.

"This is what bothers me so much. It's a big step back from the system we have which has had the advantage of lots of smart people working on it for decades to make it as efficient as possible

Processing a credit card transaction requires fractions of the computing power of processing one on the blockchain.

How many people on these forums use cash for 100% of their transactions? Do they take their paper check pay stub to the bank every week and get cash anf then put it under their mattress? 

Right now people can hold a watch up to a terminal and have the transaction processed in fractions of a second with no direct cost to the consumer while also having the security that if someone steals their bank account info or credit card they can get the transactions reversed.

"Who holds the numbers matters less than how the value of the numbers is secured.

Having the private keys for your own bitcoin won't matter if a mining group gets 51% hash power, or miners move on to another currency, or quantum computing breaks the encryption that bitcoin relies on. You don't hold what is valuable at any point, which is the network of miners and the security of the technology.

Something like Bitgold has multiple layers of value security, the first one being the value of gold which you can redeem and hold physically, the second being insurance for the gold in its vaults, and the third is the power of law to enforce the contract and regulate their behavior, which will last for as long as the government does.

As long as Bitgold is up and running you can redeem your numbers for actual gold, and since you're only using bitgold to pay/receive then you wouldn't have most of your savings in their system anymore than you would have most of your bitcoin on an exchange.

Closing a ""channel"" might take more time with gold, but the underlying value is much more secure and the fees are lower, and the payment system is faster and more reliable.

For the record I don't think any deflationary currency is a good idea, I think using gold as currency is a waste of gold, but if centralization of payment is the solution to bitcoins problems, I don't see why we need bitcoin.

"People speculate on short term shifts in the value of currency and the relative value between currencies.

If you need me to be specific, then what I meant was that no one speculates on the long term value of currency like people speculate on bitcoin, although you could probably infer that's what I meant from context.

No investment fund just buys a bunch of dollars and then sits on them waiting for them to go up, because they don't go up. They might diversify risk by holding some amount of wealth in a broad variety of currencies, and they might try to profit from the short term variations in the value of currency but none have the strategy of ""buy currency, wait a few years, sell currency"", because that's a strategy that is guaranteed to lose money. Even if dollars have gone up relative to euros during that time, they will both be worth less than they were at the start.

Your link is only talking about these two forms of speculation, either profiting from short term fluctuations or arbitrage between different currencies. Currency is not a long term investment nor should it be treated as such.

Day trading cryptos is completely different from just buying a bunch of bitcoin and hoping they indefinitely increase in value faster than the market.

People speculate on short term fluctuations on currency value, and on the relative difference between currencies.

It is not the same thing as thinking ""I think dollars are going to be worth more in 5 years time so I'm going to buy a bunch of dollars now"". No one thinks that.

No one profits or attempts to profit from just buying up a bunch of currency, sitting on it for a few years and then selling it because its guaranteed to be worth less than when you bought it.

you bring up stocks and shares which is something completely different. Buying shares entitles you to a portion of the business. Some people speculate on the future value of businesses because some businesses increase in value over time. There can be short term scams like Theranos, but in the long run speculation is unsustainable if its not backed by underlying value of the company.

> The Great Depression from happening again

The great depression involved a crippling deflationary spiral which caused a huge drop in economic productivity by encouraging currency hoarding at the expense of spending money on producing and purchasing goods and services.

"Had a conversation with my wife’s grandfather yesterday. 

He’s a major doubter of Cryptocurrencies. Which I cannot get across to him the idea that there are more things beside bitcoin. Doesn’t matter the statistics I bring in front of him, to him it’s the equivalent of going down to the Casino and dropping $1000 on the roulette table. 

He told me yesterday, “Bitcoin lost 30% this week, I don’t know how anyone can see that as anything other than a gamble.” 

Yeah, sure, if you bought a week ago you lost 30%. If you bought a month ago you made 91%. If you bought a year ago you made 1600%. And, I’m barely even in fucking bitcoin. I didn’t lose 30% this week. Despite the entire market crashing I wasn’t even down, I was up 3% yesterday. And today I’m sitting pretty. 

His major argument is, “My Merrill Lynch financial advisor strongly advises against Bitcoin, and he has never steered me wrong in the past”. 

Dude, OF COURSE HE DOESNT WANT YOU IN BITCOIN. If your money is in Bitcoin, how does he make commissions on that money? 

I really don’t know how to make him see that it’s at least a semi-reasonable investment.

"Regarding the topic by OP, **I am running for Office** : For Knox County Mayor against [Glenn Jacobs](https://jacobsformayor.com/) aka [Kane](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-jiVzY3E1k)!!!! the Wrestler.

Glenn Jacobs is actually a good guy, and I am not running a 'hate' campaign against him. I am running a 'rehaul the system' campaign.

My Election is not until August, and I need 40,000 Votes to win. This will be difficult to achieve, as through name recognition, etc, I can probably get 1,000 to 2,000, but little more. However, I have thought it through.

Some major points of my campaign :

1) Localize Governance and Enforcement of Law.

> Move from an Election of a Mayor to an Election of Neighborhood Delegates. Neighborhoods are to gather together biweekly over a Saturday at a Park and discuss political objectives, vote on them, and the Delegates are responsible for bringing the ideas to a larger town meeting of Delegates only, up to 48 Delegates. As Mayor, I would listen to the Delegates, and enact their elections into law, unless I Veto or something similar.

> With Law Enforcement, I would have Police Officers attend these meetings to discuss policing and to prevent riots. Likewise, the Neighborhoods could talk with the Police Officers about policing objectives, which will be centered around Protecting At Risk Individuals, and teaching Citizens hows to Strengthen Each Other through training. Persons without a Job, without a Social Network, and Depressed will work with Police to get their life on track, while those participating in society work together to achieve the maximum possible through study and collaboration.

2) Education refocused to be centered on Human Achievement and high practical knowledge.

> Instead of a mix of historical subjects, history would be refocused to studying the lives of key individuals. Benjamin Franklin, Napoleon Bonaparte, Adolf Hitler, Thomas Jefferson, Malcolm X, MLK, George Washington, John Winthrop, Thomas Paine, so on. Similarly, scientific subjects will be centered around the scientist making the discoveries.

> This is to remind children, and all, that humans create achievement. When you study the lives of these great people, it's clear that achievement was created over multiple years of a scientific lineage functioning together. Study of these role models, particularly at young ages, fills the mind with possibilities, that though they come from a lowly home, they could achieve the next wondrous discovery which could last for ages.

> Regarding practical knowledge, I would reorganize High Schools (ages 14 to 18) to focus on learning the skills necessary to get high paying jobs, and thus separate students into lines of study as they do in Universities. Middle Schools would be refocused toward Arts, Media, Expressions, and Communication. Elementary would be on learning of Heroes and Fore Fathers.

> This would be a minor change in the topics discussed (other than having block chain courses, and so on, in high school), but a major change in their presentation. The over all effective would create a stronger willed citizenry who have a definite purpose to their lives which they shall assign themselves before graduating high school and joining society at large.

3) Safe guard our Treasures and our Lives

> Treasure is what the elder generations must maintain and protect to pass down to younger generations. This includes ensuring that the young generation learns high paying skills, ensuring that investments gain value, and ensuring that the local community competes with the global community in such a way that our people grow to become global leaders.

> Regarding the safe guarding of life, this is where not only must we achieve in the ways of high science to compete globally, but we must also protect ourselves so that we possess the means necessary to create the basic functions of life. Such as Farming, Housing, Child Raising, Medicine, and so on.

**In Conclusion**, through reshaping communities to think locally in terms of governance, globally in terms of education and economics, and heroically in terms of parenthood and social responsibility, we can reshape a world that can exists within this one yet lead the way to the next New World.

Overtime, crypto will transition from its ""gold"" asset, speculative alt trading,  into 1.0 mature micro exchanges with mass market adoption (amazon, ebay, etc.. not just userbase) at which point one of two things will happen, or both.. the status quo adjusts their legal frame work to work with the dominant tech of the future (ie Japan) or they loose their shit and refuce to accept it and most likely get dragged into it reluctsntly kicking and screaming after the whole world already jumped in. Sadly, its the bigger economies like the eu and us that will likely drag their feet the most. War is more likely than open embracing it. Its going to be a rocky few years.. but expect big events, say russia and china trading oil in crytpo (even if state backed coins), mass adoption of decentralized exchanges, etc. Progress in the crypto realm will come from periphery economies, like Venezuela, Japan, etc who stand to gain more than to loose from crypto adoption.";6;1;False;pibechorro;dro4jjd;2018: lets run for office;7lo56s;https://i.redd.it/oy1bmxd0on501.jpg

">PayPal, a centralized hub payment processor. Lightning network, a barely less centralized payment processor that uses one less middleman for processing payments between a business and an individual that relies more on the certain business who controls the off chain(which takes away from the point of BTC already) hub.

How is lightning ""barely"" less centralized when anyone can run a node himself if he wants. Even if there would be nodes who wouldn't want to make any money and block your transaction, your payment would find another route. You are not dependend on anyone if you don't want to and you still don't have to ask permission to send someone money. Furthermore there is no lightning company who can freeze your account or steal your funds.

Central banking on the scale we know it will most likely die this century and more likely sooner than later. They’ve pushed the fiat system to its limits. The world economy was almost destroyed in 2008 but they bought themselves some time by injecting trillions into the economy and keeping interest rates at zero or even negative for the next 8 years. The economy is now more fragile than ever and next time a crisis hits, and one will it’s only a matter of time, they have really no room to cut rates and I don’t think they be able to print themselves out of the whole again. Central banks are seeing accelerating inefficiencies when it comes to the productivity of new debt. During the period after 2008, it took $18 of debt for every $1 added to GDP.

"Hi Pine, 

I am absolutely thrilled to know your extension of love to humanity through the Pineapple Fund is not mainly about Tech.

I came across your recent fund on an article on inverse.com and it proves as an early adopter, you are a fundamental player in introducing a new world all together in charity through the crypto/ Bitcoin space. I was so touched and I still am while writing this very very long message (Sorry Pine :-)

I am particularly overwhelmed as Bitcoin from this part of the world where I come from in Africa is relatively a very very ""strange"" concept especially for charities here that are attuned to the traditional funding scheme and limited by bottleneck procedures regarding funding their initiatives.   Bitcoin is almost rocket science to most of these charities since it is not mainstream and the Pineapple Fund provides an unprecedented opportunity for charities making a difference from this part of the world to keep making a difference. Pineapple fund is just one of the few ways by which Bitcoin and blockchain is changing the world. 

What baffles me is your simplicity and your values. Its not spectacular, its just supernatural. Your generosity will certainly avert calamity in so many lives,  so many lives!

The setback faced by most existing  charities I've come across which is also a global setback , is that they emphasize more on the problem, rather than developing sustainable and long term solutions to address/solve/eradicate the problem i.e the transition from awareness charities to action-driven charities. Action as they say speaks louder than words!

Dear Pine, my point is your fund will create a greater impact for projects that create direct impact and are solution driven rather than just advocacy and awareness charities as it will be expedient to support action driven charities (this is not to undermine awareness charities at all). 

In Africa and particularly from where I come from, resilience builds up very easily especially due to the abstract IMF adverse conditions relating to access to basic funding sources . I will like to offer up a few insights to consider as to what challenges your funding can do to help local charities not only survive, but thrive:

- Much international aid goes through several levels of intermediaries and sub-contractors; relatively little funding winds up in the hands of the charities themselves, which makes it difficult for them to plan long-term prompting them to work on project-by-project basis to create maximum impact in the shortest while. Of course Pineapple fund defiles the traditional funding rules by accessing  these charities directly without unnecessary intermediaries or administrative bottlenecks. 

- Local charities have a better understanding of what does and does not work in a given community.  They have a more organic relationship with people at the community level and can communicate with them in more meaningful ways. They can launch programs more quickly than large organizations can. Their levels of trust within the community are more deep-rooted than those of international agencies whose personnel are “parachuted in” and wonder why they do not get the same level of receptiveness.
Most initiatives are community based because it is based on a common African philosophy called ""UBUNTU""  which means "" I am because you are""; thus  changing one life is literally changing a family and that resonates a ripple effect. 

- Indigenous local and national fundraising capabilities are not very developed within Africa so charities are dependent on external funding sources.
.....
Fast forward ;

Your initiative will really make the lives of action driven charity beneficiaries better than they would have imagined and expand their opportunities for a decent human life, transitioning  from victims to victors, from survivors to models of inspiration and dependency to autonomy. 

If you don't mind, I will wholeheartedly do what it takes to adhere to the vision of your generosity by investing my time and skills to screen and recommend such charities in this part of the globe where your fund will do a great good, restore hope and break the dependency cycle in charities from  diverse sectors that indeed make a palpable difference in their communities and creating just and fair conditions for every human life to be valued and upheld. If just one life benefits of your unmatched generosity, I will be forever grateful to have participated in changing a life indirectly.  

Pine, you're an UBUNTU figure par excellence. 

With much respect, 
Poiema

Although I'm curious how trade volume can be 100x greater than a portfolio unless you are just losing money left and right.

"No need to be defensive, we are just having a discussion. You also provided no points, just compared BTC to FB without saying why they are the same but I'll help you see why they are not.

BTC's innovation at this point is limited as a currency as it does not solve any existing problems for the exception of laundering money. The exchanges also work off chain which if you cannot see the problem with that you have no business being in BTC. BTC on the other hand is not regulated, the exchanges are susceptible to hacks. yes you should put your money in a wallet but most new players drawn in by FOMO don't know that.

Buying bitcoin is completely different from FB. Have you ever read a financial statement in your life? FB had $27 BILLION in revenue in 2016, billions of users on virtually every smart phone and is well established. Purchasing a share in FB is purchasing a share in that revenue stream as well as their patents and HUGE market share (they own insta etc.), future growth etc. FB will not go to $0 (not saying BTC will but it is possible it can). FB is also on a regulated exchange and adheres to the required regulation therefor protecting investors. 

As I've said before, I believe in cryptos and the technology but remain critical and try to remain objective.

I've established a category, it's just that the category doesn't have any demand. The claim I was responding to specifically was talking about bitcoins, not cryptocurrency as a whole. With bitcoin there is clearly currently demand. If some other coin comes in and fills the category better, no matter how scarce the bitcoin is there wouldn't necessarily continue to be demand for bitcoins. To take it to a crazy extreme: if the governments of the world got together and decided to execute every single person who tried to spend a non-approved cryptocurrency, demand would most likely fall despite any scarcity.  If the underlying protocol for btc was found to be catastrophically flawed, same thing. All I am trying to say, however inartfully, is scarcity alone does not create demand and therefore does not create value. Don't assume solely based in the scarcity of a bitcoin that it cannot ever be worthless.

"You have a ""gut feeling"" that it's going to screw you over.

I have no idea when you invested, but... did you research it?

The first time it hit $1000 was in late 2013, like.. December 2013.  It bounced around until Feb where it dropped, and kept slowly dropping, bottoming out at $200 in mid to late 2015. 

Keep that in mind - **everyone who bought in around the $1000 mark because ""it was going to the moon!"" watched their investment crumble to a fifth of what they paid over the course of a year and a half.**

The second time it hit $1000 was in January... of 2017.

So if you bought for $1000 in December of 2013, you couldn't recoup your losses until 2017.  Three years and some change later.

Now, depending on who you talked to, the price hit $17000something or $19000something.  It's now falling again.

I wouldn't be surprised for it to drop below $3000.

And it'll be above $17000 eventually.

You didn't invest so much that waiting three or more years for an actual increase is going to hurt you, right?  You researched it and understood the price history, the swings it makes and the lengthy recovery time, right?  It didn't slowly increase to $1000 that first time - the price of Bitcoin is a tale of incredible increases, dramatic drops, and it ending higher than where it started the run, sure, but taking years to get back above the prior high water mark.

"A word isn't copyrightable. It may be subject to trademark law. And trademark law doesn't forbid *all* use of a trademarked term. But you're introducing red herrings now; laws don't determine whether people counterfeit goods; whether it's profitable to do does.

>There are lots of ways for that piece of paper to be completely unique.

Uniqueness isn't enough. You need *resistance to copying* (whether legal or not). By anyone.

In one sense your word is perpetually unique, in the same sense that there is only one number ""42"". But then what matters isn't the exact identity of your token, but the *class* it forms part of. The question of scarcity then hinges around how hard it is to find *other* members of that class. I can make up other unique words and no trademark law will stop that, but you can't make up arbitrary Bitcoin UTXOs (Unspent Transaction Outputs) that other people will accept (which is the class relevant to bitcoin-scarcity) without proving their provenance in the blockchain.

Gold's scarcity is anchored in the fact that we know of no more productive way of finding new gold atoms than by digging them out of the ground. Pretty much all the elemental substances are like this, and the only difference in their scarcity is how much of the stuff there is around us. They could all be used as money, if we chose, but some are more and some less-well suited to this task.

"Thats nonsense. There was a push to make transactions less difficult and to make it an actual currency again and it led to a hard fork.  Asking people to use a currency LESS so it can be used for actual timely transactions is so ass backwards.  Bitcoin needed to get better at dealing with load, instead it did nothing and now that more of the market is taken over by trading bots, it is unusable as a currency, and is questionable as an asset/commodity. 

2 years ago I could take a bitcoin and buy some garbage off tiger direct. Today I can take a bitcoin and hold it and ... hold it some more I guess? It looks to me that the only places that BTC is still usable as a currency are darknet markets, which are shifting to BCH/eth, and ransomware payments.

So we have this storage of wealth, or commodity, or whatever you want to call it, that has no hard backing besides a network of miners doing busy work and some people believing its worth something. A stock has the value of a piece of the company you own, a bond is the idea that you will be paid back with interest on an investment, but bitcoin? What is this value you are backing and throwing your savings at?  What determines if next week will be a +$10k week and not a -30% week?  

As far as I can tell, and I've been a regular user of this shit for p2p transactions since I bought a few coins off MtGox in 2010, there is no rhyme or reason.

"**Recursive acronym**

A recursive acronym is an acronym that refers to itself. The term was first used in print in 1979 in Douglas Hofstadter's book Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid, in which Hofstadter invents the acronym GOD, meaning ""GOD Over Djinn"", to help explain infinite series, and describes it as a recursive acronym. Other references followed, however the concept was used as early as 1968 in John Brunner's science fiction novel Stand On Zanzibar. In the story, the acronym EPT (Education for Particular Task) later morphed into ""Eptification for Particular Task"".

A guy who paid $10 for 500 bitcoins 8 years ago has nothing to lose by telling you all to KEEP HODLING, and to BUY LOW, BUY HIGH, and that whatever price bitcoin is now will seem trivial to what it will be worth years from now so don't worry if you lose money in the short term.

The majority of bitcoins are owned by a small minority of bitcoin holders.

"There is no comparison between stocks and this speculative market of crypto. 

Many people hold stocks for the long term based on the company's history, its prospects, the current market for its products and services, its management and so on. If you perform value investing, long term investing barring a once in a lifetime event such as a market crash, your investments will mostly be stable, and even provide dividends.

Sure stock market buys can be gambling depending on the sector, the company, and all kinds of variables. But let's say you put your money in a blue chip, you can expect not to lose most of that money even if you leave it there for 5 years, and in some cases you can expect to get some returns as well.

This is a ridiculous argument. Gambling and investing are not the same thing. If I look at Apple who makes billions of dollars per year, owns thousands of very useful patents and has one of the most valuable brands in the world, that is not gambling, it is investing. If you purchase an ETF that tracks the SP500 and plan to hold for 20+ years, that is not really gambling, that is investing. If you purchase a digital token that has very little in the way of utility and can be easily replaced, in the hope it goes up in value, that is gambling.

You need to get away from particular items and concentrate on *categories* to reason about scarcity coherently. Otherwise everything is ""scarce"", because there's only one of every physical item.

">Anecdotally, when the price was pretty stable at ~$400 for years, I was using it as a currency. I bought Steam games and stuff on Overstock with Bitcoin. 

that's when supply was better matched to demand. Supply rate has halved since then while demand has more than doubled (and most of that demand has gone from people who want a currency to people who want 1000% returns on investment). The worse the gap between supply and demand grows (which is hard coded to the protocol), the more hyper-deflationary and unusable as a currency it will become.

>I want to see Bitcoin continue to inflate in value until it's large enough to stabilize and be just a gently-deflationary currency

How do you anticipate ""gentle"" deflation when you're going to keep halving the supply until eventually the supply will reverse (due to lost bitcoins) and yet you expect exponential growth in adoption of the currency (from less than 1% of the earths population to I'm assuming at least 10%, if not 50% or 100%)

> 2) because it will tend to grow in value over time, people will prefer holding BTC to USD or other currencies.

Just like how everyone uses gold as currency now because its grown in value but the USD hasn't? don't bring up frangibility or ease of payment as reasons why this hasn't happened because you can use trade gold digitally more easily and more cheaply than you can use trade bitcoin, almost no one does though. because its too deflationary, even when thousands of tons of gold are mined every year.

> But to fulfill the needs of an international economy, it has to have a proportional valuation, and the only way to reach that valuation is with big upward surges

Or supply of bitcoin could just be increased to meet demand so that market cap could increase without the individual unit price increasing which incentivizes hoarding and rent seeking which is actively harmful to its use as currency.";1;0;False;suninabox;drnr3gu;To the new guys, let's see how tough you really are;7lhj3w;https://i.imgur.com/vHYx0Me.gif

You don't need to buy currency years in advance in order for it to be usable.

If everyone starts using bitcoin then you'll get paid in bitcoin, anything you sell you will get paid for in bitcoin, you will have no problem getting bitcoin to use for currency. If you believe that anyone who didn't buy bitcoin when less than 1% of the population was using it will struggle to be able to use it when it is a mainstream currency, I'm not sure how you think it could ever be a mainstream currency.

If you honestly believed that bitcoin would be worth the same 5 years from now as it is today, why would you bother buying any to then not use for 5 years?

The only reason to buy in advance is because you believe you can rent seek on artificial scarcity.

">Care to share where and when you make the judgement on when a commodity becomes ""speculation and luck"" rather than an investment vehicle? 

When it demonstrates underlying value/demand.

The vast majority of demand for bitcoin is coming from speculators who believe it will be worth more in future, so buy today, which makes it worth more in future.

Bitcoin is unquestionably a less functional currency today than it was a year ago, so there's no question of whether this demand is coming from actual utility or from anticipated gains.

People can rationalize this away by saying things like ""lightning will fix everything"" and ""its not meant to be a currency, its a store of value"", but it doesn't change the fact that people are buying based on what they think bitcoin will be worth in the future rather than what they think it will be worth today.

This is why it can be described as a bubble, because if it never becomes worth what people think it will be worth then there will be a *drastic* re-alignment from what its worth when people think it will be worth far more in the future, to what its worth when people think its only as valuable as it is today.

There's been such rapid gains in price, that there's still lots of people who anticipate futher gains despite short term set backs. When people see 1000% gains in a year, that puts peoples risk tolerance up a lot, so they're willing to ignore dire indicators like bitcoins market share halving in a year, or losing 30% of its value in a day even when its supposed to be ""stabilizing"" as the market cap gets bigger.

This is all dependent on having more people who think bitcoin will be worth more in future than people who think it will be worth less. If only 20% of people lose confidence and sell, this might cause a short term dip but its not enough to deflate the bubble. As more and more speculators get involved, the total supply of potential speculators gets less and less, and then eventually you can hit a crash where more speculators leave than can be replaced be newcomers. We're probably not at that point yet but we're not far off.";2;1;False;suninabox;drnrwbc;To the new guys, let's see how tough you really are;7lhj3w;https://i.imgur.com/vHYx0Me.gif

"Exactly. In this logic I've been ""HODL""ing coins that have been aimed at utility.

I'm playing the trading game- but thats because I want to end up with this shit in hand when I'm rocking a debt card and buying groceries with it.

At the same time so many people have been coming to me asking about bitcoin, I'll have them make an account on an exchange or set up a wallet and sell it to them for cash in hand.

I have mixed feelings about this since more people want to buy in and raises its exposure, at the same time the sky high prices and roller coaster trading defeats any function as an actual currency and does exactly that- makes it looks like some crazy money machine they don't understand.";2;1;False;AirFell85;drnd7ve;To the new guys, let's see how tough you really are;7lhj3w;https://i.imgur.com/vHYx0Me.gif
"You can want both. I want to see Bitcoin continue to inflate in value until it's large enough to stabilize and be just a gently-deflationary currency. That means massive gains for now and a reasonable currency in the long run.

Anecdotally, when the price was pretty stable at ~$400 for years, I was using it as a currency. I bought Steam games and stuff on Overstock with Bitcoin. And then I bought an equivalent amount more Bitcoin to offset the sale.

This says two things: 1) if the price is stable, people will happily use it as a currency--and it works wonderfully (or did before the fees exploded), and 2) because it will tend to grow in value over time, people will prefer holding BTC to USD or other currencies.

When you see 10x jumps, that obviously fucks with things. But to fulfill the needs of an international economy, it _has_ to have a proportional valuation, and the only way to reach that valuation is with big upward surges. If and when we reach a point where things balance out, where the market decides it doesn't need another 10x rise or 50% drop, where we just see minor fluctuations up and down like you do with any currency (but still trending gradually up), then it's utility will have a chance to shine.

"> The absurdly high fees required to transfer bitcoin to an exchange clearly show it's no longer remotely viable as a currency. I can't imagine why anyone would want to throw more money in to it. The 25X gains in one year was certainly nice for me, but it's just baffling why anyone would want to buy at the top into a currency that no longer has any functionality as a currency.

The counter argument here is that the fees are just growing pains. And that other cryptocurrencies would have similar struggles under this level of adoption. While an outsider looking in might think Bitcoin is stagnating, there's [a lot of development going on](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commits/master).

There are some vocal outliers, but it's generally accepted that fees are too high. There are also lots of people working on solutions. Perhaps that solution will be the Lightning Network, perhaps not, but there's a lot of fame and money to be made in this space.

In the meantime, the price of Bitcoin has put a huge ""bounty"" on Bitcoin exploits. Any SHA256 weaknesses or Bitcoin related bugs are literally worth millions of dollars.

The post you responded to was simply saying there comes a time when a smart person locks in their gains.

"Yes, spreading out your buys decreases standard deviation (or fluctuation)... *but there is no advantage in doing so*. If you buy all at once, you stand an equally-likely chance of buying on a dip as you do buying on a peak. Spreading them out, simply breaks the one time buy into several, each of which have the same probability as the first. Therefore, if you'd like your purchase price to be closer to the average price for that period, by all means Dollar Cost Average 'til your heart's content. My point is there is no *advantage* in doing so.

Right now, I think it's more of a commodity, closer to gold.  Gold was used as a currency for many, many years, but not so much any more.  Who knows what Bitcoin will be in the future, but right now, it's not a very good currency because it's not readily acceptable, which is one of the requirements for currency, I believe.  It has nothing to do with not wanting to spend it so much as not being able to.  I only got in to it a few years ago because I wanted to donate to a website that preferred it.  I left a little in a Coinbase account, and next time, it had gone up enough so I didn't even need to add to it.  That was when I started adding more, even though it was a ridiculous $500/coin.  :-) ;1;0;False;leftcoast-usa;drn0ykf;To the new guys, let's see how tough you really are;7lhj3w;https://i.imgur.com/vHYx0Me.gif
"You're assuming I have all my money in Bitcoin?  No way.  I would never invest more than I can afford to lose in something I can't really measure.  The only reason I ever even got started was because I needed some Bitcoin to donate a few years back, and I left some in for later, where it went up a lot, so I invested a bit more over the years.  I liked the idea, and wanted to support it.  But if I lived in one of the high-inflation countries with no alternatives, I'd probably invest more - why not?

Anyway, I've already sold enough to cover my initial investments, so what I have invested now is just profit.   I buy small amounts when it goes down, like a few hundred at 12,000 recently using a limit order that I didn't even think would trigger ";1;1;False;leftcoast-usa;drng19l;To the new guys, let's see how tough you really are;7lhj3w;https://i.imgur.com/vHYx0Me.gif

"So, speaking as an old-timer, I remember when people talked exactly this way about the Internet. Nobody was actually using it, it was all hype, the novelty would wear off. Look, some major site shut down--that proves it. Gopher is failing, and that ""world wide web"" stuff is too CPU-intensive to be useful. Established media companies and the government would never allow it to take off and replace them, or to provide unrestricted, untappable lines of communication. They'll step in and shut it down. In ten years, nobody would be using this 'Internet'! They'd be reading books and newspapers like always, and all that would be left on the Internet would be a few companies and universities.

"Anyone who claims that bitcoin is a sound investment is deluding themselves. And when they tell each other they are tough for being in and hodling (""hodl"" is getting as annoying as ""fake news""), it strengthens that delusion.

Bitcoin is a huge huge huge gamble that if it pays off by becoming money, can pay off huge. It's currently paying off by gambler buying. Nobody thinks money is this volatile or difficult/expensive  to transact.

Yes if you're willing to take the risk and make a bundle from the final play if it plays out, good for you. But don't pretend it's anything but a massive gamble. You're not tougher than everyone else. you're not smarter than everyone else. You're just willing to take a risk in the belief it will pay off. That's good enough. No need to marginalize non believers or sellers.

I hope you make a killing out of it. I really would prefer currency out of government's hands. I just think the chances of anything taking over fiat are very small. And a smaller chance is that crypto will be the replacement (could be gold, could be some other technology no one has thought of). And a smaller chance still that bitcion will be the crypto. And even smaller that bitcoin will be the crytpo forever.

"""Everyone is really here to use it as a free money scheme""

">Does no one have faith in BTC/crypto as a future currency? Everyone is really here to use it as a free money scheme?

There's a reason this sub says ""Submit link NOT about price"".

It's a speculative asset. No one gives a shit how useful it is they just care about how much money they can make from ""hodl""ing. If people didn't expect to make money from speculation to HODL. People only want to HODL while the price is going up, only then do they plan on actually using them. The very fact you're measuring bitcoins success in price:

>Bitcoin was $2500 this summer. <$1000 a year ago

and not how widely accepted it is, shows that you are one of these people who see's it as a free money machine.

you should not want bitcoin to increase in value when increasing in value deters people from spending it and leads to price surges and crash that ruin any confidence that it will hold a consistent value.

course then you have to start asking difficult questions about how bitcoin could simultaneously become more useful without rising in price, and you won't like the conclusion to that if you still want to make money off it.";20;2;False;suninabox;drn2gv8;To the new guys, let's see how tough you really are;7lhj3w;https://i.imgur.com/vHYx0Me.gif
"You're still in BTC even if you're in alts.

Lets say you have 100$ and you buy BTC when it has a value of 1000$. Now, you buy an altcoin for the 0.1 BTC you have. Now wether the altcoin goes up or down, you will gain or lose BTC. The price of BTC will fluctuate alongside that. So lets say you gained so much from your altcoins that you now have 0.2 BTC. But BTC is now worth 500$. You still have 100$. So you can't hedge against BTC in alts. You'll still feel the ups & downs from BTC when in alts.
So just focus on making BTC with your alts.";1;1;False;Vertan1;drn5m1l;To the new guys, let's see how tough you really are;7lhj3w;https://i.imgur.com/vHYx0Me.gif

Whether the contracts are settled financially or not - you could still get someone heavily enough invested to dump the top, creating the top, and then use the financial gain from the increase in value of the contract to cover the decreased profit from keeping up volume selling lower until the effect has snowballed and everyone is selling. Then sell the contract, increase their stack of btc and let it ride back up. There has to be some investment group with enough clout to do this. I'm probably wrong. No doubt there. But it's definitely possible. ;1;0;False;DivineLawnmower;drnl8tl;To the new guys, let's see how tough you really are;7lhj3w;https://i.imgur.com/vHYx0Me.gif
