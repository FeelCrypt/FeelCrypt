"**Perth Mint**

The Perth Mint is Australia's official bullion mint and wholly owned by the Government of Western Australia. Established on 20 June 1899, two years before Australia's Federation in 1901, the Perth Mint was the last of three Australian colonial branches of the United Kingdom's Royal Mint (after the now-defunct Sydney Mint and Melbourne Mint) intended to refine gold from the gold rushes and to mint gold sovereigns and half-sovereigns for the British Empire. Along with the Royal Australian Mint, which produces coins of the Australian dollar for circulation, the Perth Mint is the older of the two mints issuing coins that are legal tender in Australia.

Well, in this particular instance, I think Peter's clinging to gold might very well be due to his age (and the fact that he owns a precious metals dealer). It seems like it is so obvious to millenials and gen Z that there is nooooo way society could go back to using physical gold, so that only leaves digital transacting of the rights to gold, where the gold is centrally held. But that entirely misses the need for decentralization and individual sovereignty, and I think this is the part that Peter misses. He is old, and I think it's precisely his age that he doesn't think decentralization and individual sovereignty is critical.
