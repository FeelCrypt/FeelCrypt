"You realize reductio ad absurdum isn't a logical fallacy right?

It's a form of argument which can be fallacious or not depending on the premise and the conclusion you attempt to draw from it.

The wikipedia article you kindly linked to includes a valid example of reductio ad absurdum, one being a mathematical proof that there is no smallest rational number since you can always divide by 2 to get a smaller one.

Would you care to say why my argument is wrong? Is it faulty premises or are the premises valid but the logic applied to them is invalid?";3;1;False;suninabox;dpxbg96;Old but I will never get tired of it;7d7a3o;https://i.redd.it/12m1n65fg7yz.jpg
"**Reductio ad absurdum**

In logic, reductio ad absurdum (Latin for ""reduction to absurdity""; or argumentum ad absurdum, ""argument to absurdity"") is a form of argument which attempts either to disprove a statement by showing it inevitably leads to a ridiculous, absurd, or impractical conclusion, or to prove one by showing that if it were not true, the result would be absurd or impossible. Traced back to classical Greek philosophy in Aristotle's Prior Analytics (Greek: ἡ Εις άτοπον απαγωγή, translit. hê eis atopon apagôgê, lit. 'reduction to the impossible'), this technique has been used throughout history in both formal mathematical and philosophical reasoning, as well as in debate.

"I can tell you're not into history. It's factual. You're uninformed so I suggest you start reading up.

Let me help you:

In the final days of World War II, 44 leaders from all of the Allied nations met in **Bretton Woods, New Hampshire** in an effort to create a new global economic order. With much of the global economy decimated by the war, the United States emerged as the world's new economic leader. The relatively young and economically nimble U.S. served as a refreshing replacement to the globe's former hegemon: a debt-ridden and war-torn Great Britain.

In addition to introducing a number of global financial agencies, the historic meeting also created an international gold-backed monetary standard which relied heavily upon the U.S. Dollar.

Initially, this dollar system worked well. However, by the 1960's, the weight of the system upon the United States became unbearable. On **August 15, 1971**, President Richard M. Nixon shocked the global economy when he officially ended the international convertibility from U.S. dollars into gold, thereby bringing an official end to the Bretton Woods arrangement.

Two years later, in an effort to maintain global demand for U.S. dollars, another system was created called the *petrodollar system*. In **1973**, a deal was struck between Saudi Arabia and the United States in which every barrel of oil purchased from the Saudis would be denominated in U.S. dollars. Under this new arrangement, any country that sought to purchase oil from Saudi Arabia would be required to first exchange their own national currency for U.S. dollars. In exchange for Saudi Arabia's willingness to denominate their oil sales exclusively in U.S. dollars, the United States offered weapons and protection of their oil fields from neighboring nations, including Israel.

By **1975**, *all of the OPEC nations had agreed to price their own oil supplies exclusively in U.S. dollars in exchange for weapons and military protection.*

This petrodollar system, or more simply known as an ""oil for dollars"" system, created an immediate artificial demand for U.S. dollars around the globe. And of course, as global oil demand increased, so did the demand for U.S. dollars.

That is why we went after Saddam in Iraq, as he was switching from the USD FRN to the Euro in regards to the Petrodollar. 

http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,998512,00.html

Iraq was not about ordinary chemical or even nuclear weapons of mass destruction. The ‘weapon of mass destruction’ was the threat that others would follow Iraq and shift to euros out of dollars, creating mass destruction of the United States’ hegemonic economic role in the world.

Same thing with Gaddafi and Libya.

">So fiat is not so great to ""hoard"" (keep). Agreed.

That's what you want from a currency. Money is for buying and selling things. If you want something you can just hold and not spend there are thousands of assets that you can already do that with. A currency people would rather hold than spend is a bad currency, which is a reason gold died off as a currency.

If you want to keep something valuable then you should buy something valuable with money. Relative decreases in money supply rewards economic inactivity, and rewards people who already have money at the expense of people who don't.

Inflation rewards those who put money to useful purposes and punishes people who hold money out of supply without doing anything with it. Which is why almost every successful economy in the world has a moderately inflationary money supply.

>Great if you're the customer of a risky merchant. If you're an honest merchant it's risk, and if you're customer of an honest merchant it's added cost.

I've had banks save me hundreds of dollars from fraud before, why would I (or any other consumer) be against chargebacks and other consumer protections?

Merchants don't like them, they also don't like providing refunds but they do it anyway because they have to compete for customers.

Timmy can now live more comfortably than before. Well in theory.

Fiat currency makes this worse as you can instruct the central bank to artificially keep interest rates down making borrowing money artificially cheaper than it should this leads to a run away creation of debts, since [Money *IS* Debt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AC6RSau7r8) in a fiat system this leads to an expansion in the money supply and inflation of prices.

Bitcoin is even more deflationary than gold, though, long-term. It'll be an interesting experiment. Mainstream economists would probably unanimously predict that it'd lead to a deflationary spiral or other catastrophe, but Bitcoin was created in part due to skepticism of mainstream economics. If Bitcoin takes over the world, this'll not only provide people with a much better currency than anything before, but it'd discredit a lot of popular economics.

Keep in mind that although Bitcoin is intentionally *very* deflationary, it's not possible for a decentralized cryptocurrency to behave like a central bank, since decentralized cryptocurrencies cannot know their own prices.

It sounds a lot less valuable if you say that 100 Satoshi are only worth $0.007.

Houses generally depreciate in value over time because they start falling apart and become obsolete.

most property wealth does not come from houses, it comes from land. A small piece of waste ground in Manhattan is worth more than a mansion in Detroit.

There's a finite amount of land on earth, and an even smaller amount of land that has legal permission to build a house on it, and an even smaller percentage of that land which is close to rich cities which is where the highest demand for residential space is.

>It is only because you are indoctrinated into thinking things as having increased value because of your inflationary frame of reference.

The average annual wage used to be worth more than the average house. Now the average house is worth several times the average wage, even though the average wage has gone up since then. Of course as mentioned its the land that's become more valuable, not the house.

"**Money supply**

In economics, the money supply (or money stock) is the total amount of monetary assets available in an economy at a specific time. There are several ways to define ""money"", but standard measures usually include currency in circulation and demand deposits (depositors' easily accessed assets on the books of financial institutions).

Money supply data are recorded and published, usually by the government or the central bank of the country. Public and private sector analysts have long monitored changes in money supply because of the belief that it affects the price level, inflation, the exchange rate and the business cycle.

Homelessness emerged as a national issue in the 1870s. Many homeless people lived in emerging urban cities, such as New York City. Into the 20th century, the Great Depression of the 1930s caused a devastating epidemic of poverty, hunger, and homelessness.

">Then saving for a house can work? Or is it that they are increasing in price, and yet decreasing in value, and the price at which they are increasing is greater than interest in your savings?

If you read the rest of the post before replying you'd see that I was making a distinction between the value of house and the value of land, I wasn't saying that property has gone down in value.

Property values overall have increased significantly over the last 100 years, yes even accounting for inflation or wages or both. Measure the price of property in gold or bitcoin or whatever you like and you'll see the same trend.

By any measure land has become more valuable due to a combination of natural scarcity of land, exacerbated by restrictions on construction in those areas (which increases demand for the areas construction has been permitted).

Land comprises the vast majority of property wealth. I'm not sure why you would make this a debatable point when a piece of waste ground in new york (or other area with high demand for living space) is worth more than a mansion in another area.

Bitcoin doesn't need all countries on earth to 'tolerate' it; it just needs some of them. The countries that do embrace bitcoin (probably less developed countries) will be able to do commerce with each other like never before. Countries that are too aggressive in 'regulating' bitcoin will find themselves being left out of significant trade markets. 




It's pretty hard to convince the public of some great danger posed by strings of random digits.. Remember when they declared drugs illegal and removed the demand for drugs? Remember when they successfully were able to get rid of all the drugs with threats of violence or imprisonment? 

The speculative portion of the price would crash but the economic value of the system would remain. Slowly and surely the price would rise again, poor monetary policy of G7 countries would drive real demand. If Bitcoin was illegal, people wouldn't​ need to worry about claiming gains on their taxes or abiding by regulations. 

Obviously government decisions are not always rational or logical, but with proper assessment they would conclude there is more to lose by outlawing Bitcoin than there is by trying to regulate it.

"Because of the limited supply and the network effect. 

The more people use it the more valuable it becomes. The more valuable it becomes, the more people are drawn to it as a store of value.

That's the crux of it, it's a virtuous cycle.

Add to that all of these new technical improvements and things like bitcoin debit cards and it starts to look viable as a transaction medium as well. When you have that sort of fluidity and the price keeps rising people start to wonder why not go all in?

Where as with USD the fed is pumping out trillions of new currency each year to buy federal debt and global demand is falling as places are switching to yen, gold or euros to trade for oil. USD is going down, GBP is going down, EUR is doing surprisingly well to be fair but the ECB is run by Germans who know how sucky hyperinflation is.

I don't think we are going to see bitcoins take over anytime soon but maybe in another couple of years a small African or South American country will suffer hyperinflation and resort to using bitcoin as the official currency.

I've traded with it for 5 years, but not to invest...I've seen how it works and how long it takes to transfer. Its a remarkable store of value, unmoored to government decrees.

"You mister haven't yet fully understood what bitcoin really is deep down. The value of bitcoins comes not from the money itself, but its intrisic value comes from the fact that, unlike ANY other fiat, you can transfer it. You'll tell me that you can pay also with notes and coins. Yes it's true, and bitcoin really is a lot like that. But the BIG HUGE difference is that you are physically limites with fiat, meaning you have to give the money hand to hand to the other person.

Today if you want to transfer money over a distance you HAVE TO use banks wiring system. So you depend on a bank to accept your transactions.
But we don't trust banks ! They have been unreliable, untrustworthy and steal money. Plus they can cancel your account anytime (they did it with Wikileaks, they stop accepting money for wikileaks and froze their accounts with no reason !).

So for the first time in human history you can send/receive money over long distance without ANY KIND OF INTERMEDIARIES. And your money is more secure than it has ever been with banks (how easy it is to steal a credit card ? Or even buy credit cards numbers on the darknet ?).

So it allows you to become independant from the banks, and bigger than that, from any government. It is true decentralization. That's where the intrinsic value of Bitcoin comes from. Plus the fact that there will only be 21 000 000 BTC EVER, and you know, basic supply and demand, makes it prices go up, as more people hear about it more people want it. It could have been a bubble, had it not have this intrinsic value I was talking about before.

"Fiat is currently being devalued by Bitcoin. That's why the price is so high in comparison to the USD FRN. It's called Gresham's Law in economics. The bad money (fiat) circulates within the economy and the good money (BTC) exits the economy and is held onto as the valuation goes up. That is what is currently happening. It will continue to happen until the currency matures. It's a long way from that, so people will continue to HODL and use the essentially worthless fiat while storing the stronger currency.

Simple economic math. For $12K/BTC market cap must be ~$200b. Currently @ $120b @ $7200/BTC.

$800K/BTC would require $13.3T market cap.

$1,000,000/BTC = $16.7T market cap.

"That's the implication, yes.  But I think it's something more subtle.  I don't foresee fiat going away any time soon.  what I think bitcoin is going to do, is deflate the worlds fixed asset credit bubble.

Said [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7adetn/consumers_are_wrongly_perceiving_bitcoin_as_a/dp9cwby/), mostly I think bitcoin will finally separate the good debt from the bad debt. It is my personal belief ( as in i don't know of any formal theory ) that debt should only be incurred for the use of building a productive asset. In a deflationary currency, this encourages businesses to ensure that productivity increases will have greater returns than savings. Instead, our financial system has encouraged the acquisition of debt for fixed assets. The only thing this has done is bid up the price of those fixed debts with debt, and handed over the money for supporting that system to banks and their owners. In order to stimulate growth in such a system, the only way that you can function is to tax savings. That's what inflation is.  What it forces people to do is to invest in increasingly risky assets, because of the loss of their purchasing power.  Hence bubble after bubble after bubble.  Crisis after crisis after crisis.

Bitcoin will eventually stabilize to an ever appreciating value asset. But what it will allow you to do is save for a house. If you have a business proposal that encourages people to pay you for a good or service, people will invest their savings in it and take on that risk.  Banks will instead move back to providing capital to businesses, using savings from people that are willing to invest.  Businesses will again focus on productivity increases, because that's how you get access to capital.

I also don't think it is going to be resisted quite as much as people think it will be. People still need to pay their taxes, and that is not going to stop. The main thing it is going to do is prick the bubble of consumer debt, and remove the banking middle-men from that space. That alone is a multi-trillion dollar industry, let alone the annuities that banks own and graft from, from those assets. Removing these people (i.e. banking debt suppliers) from positions of power, by strangling their access to capital, is a justification for bitcoin in its own right. Imagine a world in which banks didn't control governments.

"Deflationary assets (land, gold, etc) have existed for thousands of years, I'm not sure what you think is so revolutionary about it.

We could still be using gold as a currency if we wanted to but not a single country in the world opted to stay on the gold standard because debt provides high marginal utility.

>But what it will allow you to do is save for a house

Why would anyone want to save to buy a house outright when you can borrow money to buy one instead?

The opportunity cost is massive.

Let's say you save $500 a month for 16 years to buy a $100,000 house. Or you could put down a $10,000 deposit, and pay $500 a month for the next 20 years paying off the mortgage.

In that time the house will have increased in value greater than the interest + you get to have a house 16 years earlier + inflation erodes down the value of the debt over time.

Saving money is a terrible idea for most things. Money is simply a medium of exchange, it  provides no value if its not being used. Borrowing money allows people to realize today the value of investments rather than having to save for decades to get the money to build a factory or buy a house, which is why every economically successful country in the last 100 years has used debt to help build its economy.";13;3;False;suninabox;dpwselm;Old but I will never get tired of it;7d7a3o;https://i.redd.it/12m1n65fg7yz.jpg

That said, as the tech is built out, I think that *some* altcoins will become irrelevant. As higher level functions of bitcoin come online they will deliver the same advantages and utilities that people valued those altcoins for. 2nd / 3rd layer protocols, side chains, drive chains, blinded bearer certificates... there are lots of ideas about how to increase the functionality of bitcoin.

The most important invention in this space was 'Nakamoto Consensus', the blockchain: a solution to the Byzantine General's problem. While I mean no disrespect to the work of altcoin developers, I don't think any of them have invented something as fundamentally paradigm-shifting as this, instead they have just invented tweaks and improvements, any of which could be adapted by bitcoin. Bitcoin also holds a large first mover advantage, and a reputation that is in line with what defines a solid store of value, so while it is not invincible, it seems to be the 'safest bet' within the industry right now.

I'm not so sure about that...

I certainly am not waiting a lifetime for this phenomenon to occur as from my perspective Bitcoin's price is a function of its utility and I want to see returns on my investment as soon as possible.

"Because 7600 is (was) a major support line.The all-time high was a just a spike, 7600 was the support.  Since I wrote that comment, it broke through that and kept going.

Think of it this way.  A previous top represents where a lot of people sold.  If it kept climbing back up to that number only to get knowcked down, it means the market wasn't comfortable with it going over that price.

If it breaks through that price, it means that not only are people not selling at that price anymore, but that others are buying in.  Which means for those new buyer, 7600 is their *floor*.

"These ""rich"" were not rich a very short while ago.  They took the biggest risks of anyone and bootstrapped the price and the ecosystem; many of them lost big and are now poorer.  Some got rich.  They earned it.  

You can buy fractions of a bitcoin, you know.  Your risk taking on bitcoin now (in the hopes of getting massive returns) is, if anything, diminished from the risk that the (now rich) early adopters took.  Your rewards could still be massive.

If there is any market which least deserves the over-blown fear that the rich get richer, and everyone else gets hosed. . . it's bitcoin.

Never invest more than you can afford to lose.  Past performance does not indicate future results.

Those disclaimers said: I have yet to hear of a single person holding their bitcoin for at least a couple years (which is not much time at all) who lost value (for the vast majority of bitcoin's history, you only needed to hold at least 7 months to make a sizeable return).  It is so laughably easy for anyone (rich or poor) to grow their wealth with bitcoin, that it borders on insanity how skeptical or even hateful so many people are towards the idea of even just buying a modest amount and setting it aside.

"A lawyer can't, but a lawyer can convince a judge to. If your spouse (or soon-to-be ex-spouse) finds out how much you have, they can take it. You can try using the excuse ""lost my Trezor in a boating accident"" but judges have heard that shit long before bitcoin existed. It used to be ""all of my cash was in a box and I lost it in a boating accident"".

The judge will laugh at you and tell you to pay anyway because you can't prove you actually spent or lost the money. They'll garnish your wages. You might say ""then I won't have a job and I'll just live off of my secret bitcoins"". Right, until a private investigator sees that you've been spending money you haven't earned and notify the courts and the IRS, who will come and take your stuff away. And thanks to the open ledger nature of bitcoin, they can just watch your wallet address like a hawk and wait for any movement to come after you to prove you lied. So yeah, you'll end up paying anyway. Unless you just flee the country and never come back.

But is it really worth it? Why the fuck would you be in a relationship with someone where you actually consider leaving the country with your money as a viable relationship exit strategy?

Also remember that hiding assets can be grounds for divorce. People are worried about what will happen if their spouse is an asshole and tries to take their money, but by hiding assets you're making the first asshole move.

But also I suspect people who suggest hiding bitcoin assets from your spouse aren't actually married. And probably teenagers who haven't been in a serious relationship with anyone at all.";46;5;False;lucky_rabbit_foot;dpwx0i7;$7452!;7dccpd;https://i.redd.it/6h0pn7cg9cyz.jpg

No, but I would if I could. Do you think people buy Teslas knowing absolutely nothing about them? You can go watch a video or something on how autopilot works. This is the internet, not 17th century catholicism.

They will stop for you but then autopilot stops and alerts you to regain control. They have the option to turn on the creep forward like you'd get from an automatic car, or have it stay put or roll back like a manual transmission car would. So one way or the other, you have to hold your foot on the brake when you're stopped. You have to use the brake at some point, because it's not a completely autonomous vehicle. It is a car with intelligent cruise control that can stay in its lane, change lanes, and slow down or stop when the car in front of it does.

I'm not sure if this is what it looks like if you have the hardware but haven't gotten the package. But sometimes the circle doesn't show up at all.

I'll concede this to you sir, 50k is not much to support a family of 4 in this economy.  That being said, having that much income passively (as a landlord) and a free roof over your head puts you in a better position as a family of 4 than many most others.

People who had real estate in the 90s or earlier are doing alright even if their income is not very much.   Modest houses are soon to average over $2mln unless there is a major correction.  We've all seen gentrification in neighborhoods, but it's interesting to see it slowly but surely happening to a large city in it's entirety and the surrounding area too.  Once we rezone agricultural land outside the city so that most food must be brought in from elsewhere, we'll see our own LA-like sprawl which might help the housing crisis short term but not be without it's consequences long term.";3;1;False;jjones4coin;dpxfesw;$7452!;7dccpd;https://i.redd.it/6h0pn7cg9cyz.jpg

"Not sure what that has to do with anything I said....
I didn't discuss the rarity of modern Lamborghinis at all. 

Also the notion that just because a 10 year old exotic costs only $80,000 and is therefore ""affordable"" is laughable. Usually people who say this don't have any experience with exotics. 

A clutch job alone on an 06 Gallardo requires the cars entire rear panel to be dismantled, exhaust dismantled/removed, and then put back together once the new clutch plates are fitted. The cost? around $7,000 - $9,000 US. For a single clutch replacement. 

There is no such thing as a cheap Lamborghini. And because somebody can buy an $80,000 Toyota does NOT mean they can afford to purchase, drive and maintain a used Lamborghini just because it may have a similar sticker price at the time.

There's soooo MUCH more to being able to ""afford"" a car than just paying the sticker.
