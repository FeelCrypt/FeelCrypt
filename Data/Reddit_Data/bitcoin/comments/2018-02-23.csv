You're missing my point. I basically had a winning lottery ticket and gave it away. Now with prices fluctuating by as much as $2,000 in a day, it's just idiotic to use BTC as an actual currency to try and buy things. Nobody will accept it due to high fees and slow verification, plus the likely immediate loss in value. It's like trying to pay in timeshares on a car.;1;1;False;lesgeddon;dup30su;Bitcoin Doesn't Give a Fuck.;7yaaz2;https://v.redd.it/ty2y74gawug01

Funny thing is..they placed a $200 a week limit on me..yet they took $2000 in double and triple billings from my account from Jan 25th til Feb 20th.  No response from my case file in two weeks.
