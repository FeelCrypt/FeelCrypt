"Copy pasting from an earlier post I made:

I learned about crypto late February. I heard about the Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF, and everyone here in this subreddit was EXCITED about it, how it could possibly cause bitcoin to moon to $3000, $5000, or even $10000.

With the potential of getting x3, x5, or even x10 returns on my money, I bought as MUCH bitcoin as I could last Feb, and sat there waiting for the ETF.

What I didn't realize was.... everyone else was hedging into other altcoins, in case of a bitcoin price crash.

In the 1st-2nd week of March, in just a span of a few days, the following happened:

- E.TH went from $13 to $50 (more than x3)
- D.ASH went from $20 to $100 (x5)
- P.IVX went from 3000 sat to almost 60k sat (x20!)
- S.TRAT went x5
- ... and so on...

I could keep going. Almost every coin worth of note pumped an UNREALISTIC amount during that week.

I was a bitcoin maximalist, I called every other coin a sh1tcoin. Heavily influenced by this subreddit, which was the only crypto subreddit I used to visit.

And I was utterly crushed when I learned these MOON RIDES happened RIGHT UNDER MY NOSE.

These gains are IMPOSSIBLE to realize in a short time frame on bitcoin alone. And if it does happen (due to something big like an ETF, or Segwit locking in), all other crypto will rise along with it, as they are traded on exchanges with BTC pairings.

Also, since that time:

- E.TH has even more than doubled on top of that in BTC price (combined with BTC price more than doubling, making it have a total of x20 rise in USD price in just a few months),
- S.TRAT has done a x10 on top of that (doing a full x50 in just 3 months, and that's just in BTC price... it's a full **x100 (!) in just 3 months** in USD if you count in the BTC price doubling, as it went from around 10 million USD marketcap to 1 billion USD),
- and many other coins have made RIDICULOUS gains.

I bought 2 BTC of ARK back in March. When it doubled after a week, I sold half (to get my 2 BTC back), and the remaining ARK (which is essentially ""FREE"", as I got my investment back) is now worth 8 BTC.

Learning the entirety of the crypto world is definitely in your best interests.";2;0;False;bit_LOL;dildca4;Man buys $27 of bitcoin, forgets about them, finds they're now worth $886k | Technology;6fd6ne;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/dec/09/bitcoin-forgotten-currency-norway-oslo-home
"> He blended a totally expert knowledge of cryptography (<100 people worldwide have this) with genius, virtually bug free programming, an incredibly forecasting ability, a consummate understanding of game theory and **economics**

Well he probably didn't know much about economics, otherwise he wouldn't have called bitcoin a *currency* since it lacks one the main feature an economy needs from a currency : the ability the grow the amount of available money with the growth of the economy (otherwise you have the best recipe for deflation, see the history of the gold standard through the industrial revolution and the XXth century).

At the end of the day Bitcoin could make a pretty good _safe-haven investment_ (like gold) in the long run, but its current volatility isn't really in favor of such use.";4;0;False;StyMaar;dijx7df;PSA: If you're new here and wondering how bitcoin works, take an hour or two to read through the whitepaper. It's 8 pages long and still the most lucid description of the system that I've ever read.;6dsot4;https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf
"These are two very different things and he is not reaching.
He's just not explaining it very well imho.

Let me try and explain the difference to you

 Mt gox was a bitcoin exchange carelessly run by a third party. Nothing to do with bitcoin on a protocol level. The hack occurred, people lost their money, and nothing on the blockchain was altered/rolled back afterwards. This is a perfect example of why bitcoin is considered to be immutable. It is one of its strong points in the long term.

When the DAO hack occurred in eth, it was a hacker that was able to penetrate the poorly coded DAO smart contract and move the funds into his own wallet. Again not exactly a flaw on the protocol level..more so than the mt gox hack but that's besides the point I am trying to make here. Anyways - moving on...So the hacker was able to steal $100M worth of eth and move it into his own wallet. A catastrophe just like the mt gox hack but things happen, and life goes on as would the blockchain. But because of the fact that the majority of the $100m belonged to a small number of wealthy investors, the ethereum foundation + vitalik buterin decided to instead perform a hardfork to recover the funds back from the hacker and return them to the wealthy investors which essentially resulted in a bailout, and from that point forward ethereum could no longer be considered an immutable blockchain. 

Many new investors aren't even aware this happened, or they don't care to learn all the facts, but it is definitely something to take into consideration if you are considering to invest a substantial amount in ethereum long term, or trying to compare bitcoin to ethereum.

"Great comment haha. Sorry you feel you have missed the boat :\ I know the feeling..That's exactly how I felt when I heard bitcoin had spiked to $1200 back in 2013. I had planned to buy a significant amount just a few weeks beforehand at $90 per btc but was too lazy and never got around to it. Lucky for me I was given a second chance and started buying from $800...the entire way down to $200. Was a rough two years, but my patience has finally paid off to say the least lol

Block limits are not the problem, block validation and storage is the problem.

"The second layer ('side chain') is the main reason segwit is seen as a scaling compromise. There is no need to increase block size and create unnecessary bloat when you can have lightning and competing second layer settlement systems in place. The largest blocksize you would need with Segwit to fully realize lightning would be around 32mb but by the time that becomes necessary storage will have at least quadrupled in size and will cost a fraction of what it does today (SSD, HDD, external drives etc..)

 Even Jihan flipping Wu is on board with Segwit.";1;0;False;RallyUp;dik12bg;$2800! Welcome back, old friend. Pardon me, I don't believe we've met.;6fiz91;https://i.redd.it/z4skyjpirx1z.jpg

"Just because you can't see why it's appreciating in value first hand does not mean there isn't a good reason. Bitcoin is the most efficient way, and sometimes the only way (depending on where you live) to move large amounts of money across the globe. It's definitely not ""slow"" when compared to any other method of moving wealth globally, and operates 24/7 for the past 7 years no down time. In places like Venezuela, Brazil, etc. people DEPEND on bitcoin. It is their only way to protect themselves from hyperinflation and the likes. This will not stop either, it's only going to continue in more countries around the world in the short term. 

Yes bitcoin is not ""the perfect currency"" at the moment (for smaller transfers) because of increasing transaction fees, but when the segwit + lightning network protocol upgrades are implemented that will be fixed. It is also important to keep in mind that part of the reason the transaction fees are becoming more and more expensive in USD terms as of recently is because the price per bitcoin is also becoming more and more expensive in USD as of recently! They go hand in hand.

"High miner fees means people's marginal utility of using bitcoin is at least that much. It's one of the strongest evidence that bitcoin is used for something beyond speculation.

Long-term bitcoin requires fees to pay for mining as inflation drops to zero. People who use bitcoin as a store of value (i.e. those who have the most influence on price) should love it when miner fees go up because it means their digital gold has a sustainable future. Until miner fees started going up about 18 months ago nobody had any idea whether the whole fees-replace-inflation thing would even work.";2;0;False;belcher_;dikmo58;$2800! Welcome back, old friend.
