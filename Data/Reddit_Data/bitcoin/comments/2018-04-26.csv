that's not what happens. The fed has the ability to control the base supply and have influence on the credit supply (which can and does also exist under fixed supply monetary systems) and the yield curve but it does not fine tune to that level. 

Suppliers don't mind raising prices yes but buyers don't mind lowering their bids. Prices can be sticky up or down but if they get too sticky, the underlying demand and supply of the assets force the moves in prices.

I don't understand what you're trying to say with this statement.

No, that's false. You're being misleading and it's irritating to have to navigate your deceptive language. 

>If BTC is an implementation of the Bitcoin protocol

You just said, ""If Bitcoin is an implementation of the Bitcoin protocol"". That doesn't make any rational sense. You might as well be saying, ""If the moon is the moon, then a pinecone also is"". Do you see how this is nonsensical?

>BCH also is. Why calling it an altcoin?

Bcash is an altcoin because it's not Bitcoin. That's the definition of an altcoin... any form of cryptocurrency which is not Bitcoin is an altcoin. Bcash is not Bitcoin, and therefore Bcash is an altcoin. 

>If it's the same protocol 

It's not the same protocol. It's a completely incompatible protocol from Bitcoin and they have completely separate networks.

>the same transaction history

As I said, the transaction history was copied from Bitcoin on August 1st 2017. They are not the same transaction history. Bcash transactions are not Bitcoin transaction.

>it's the same coin

As explained previously, it's not the same coin and you're being intentionally ignorant of the facts laid out before you. 

>only time will tell which of the two chains wins

Time has already told. The matter was settled within hours, or even days if we're being generous. Again, Bcash is not Bitcoin and Bcash will never be Bitcoin. Just like a fish will never be the moon. Please stop deluding yourself. 

>it's all very clear on the white paper.

Completely ambiguous, faith-based statement.

>Mostly by trolls, as BCash has several meanings, here in Brazil BCash is a relatively common way to pay for online stuff, much more accepted than BTC, but has nothing to do with crypto currency.

Here you are blaming Bitcoiners because the leaders of Bcash couldn't pick a creative name for their altcoin. You should blame the Bcash leaders for this problem instead. People who call the altcoin Bcash are doing everyone a favor by reducing confusion. 

>Why not? The only breaks on transaction backward compatibilities were made to prevent wrong spends from a BTC address to a BCH inicio and vice versa.

That's literally what ""not compatible"" means. If you want, I can help you test this for yourself. You will see that you cannot send Bcash coins to the Bitcoin blockchain and you cannot send Bitcoins to the Bcash blockchain. That's what I mean when I say they're totally separate.

>Except they aren't, same protocol, same technology, same block chain,

NO. Please stop repeating the same stupid statements that are easily disproven. Flat Earth mentality is absolutely not welcome here. 

>the paper predicts this sort of works as the way to upgrade the technology, 

Thank you for demonstrating your lack of understanding so plainly. Please do us both a favor and go back and read past the abstract. Satoshi is describing PoW not as a method to hijack the protocol, but as a method for resolving differences in *transaction ordering*. Obviously Satoshi understood that miners do not rule Bitcoin. 

>if only one chain remains on the long run that chain becomes Bitcoin, while two exists they're two different Bitcoin implementations.

Here you are acknowledging that Bitcoin is in fact Bitcoin, and then trying to pretend that a fish is the moon. Stop being ridiculous. That's not how blockchains work at all. 

> This sort of split also can happen without a fork of the code but by mere chance.

You do realize that Bcash forked more than just the code right? They forked the entire blockchain to a new altcoin. Does that make sense to you?

"> First of all that's not his quote

i don't care and i have not tell something like that simply because it is not relevant for an objective point of view. so, why are you assuming that i care about the ""man"" not about the arguments ? (it is rhetoric here.)

> He doesn't plan on quitting in a year

yeah... it is open without any deadlines, as for every ""step"" in their most basic ""to do"" list. the yesterday dust problem solution is an epic example on how they ""project"" their progression. when someone point them the fact that this kind of sketchy problem should be adressed on a few days basis  not 8 months, they answer: ""*we never told that we were working 8 months on it*"", but throughout the complaints made before, they was systemacilly responding that ""it is not simple to implement a solution for that, but we are working hard on it"". 

btw, this is not my point, the point (fact) that you missed here by your objective analyse (talking about the man not the BNB that i clearly pointed)  is that it's a ""one man leaded"" **coin**. wich is burned (when and on what proportion)  as it pleases to it's own central emitter. did you need some info on this?

i ask you to reread my question, with more bjectivity in mind. otherwise we can't have a healthy debate.

When you will understand the following argument example, you can say that you ""got it"" the right way :

> he has a marketing plan and budget

The marketting plan regarding bnb coin, is worst than not having any, because it is proven ""contradictory"", for example: a mythic quote of the lead : *""No decentralized exchange today can handle our volume, and none are as secure as we are. Changpeng Zhao""* and one of the key goal on their plan is: ""Binance is planning to launch a decentralized exchange in the coming months and almost everyone is invited, founder and Chief Executive Officer Changpeng Zhao said.""  and for acheiving this example goal: ""Binance Coin (BNB) will be upgraded to exist on its own blockchain mainnet""

the new DEX (decentralized) will be powered  by an upgraded BNB coin, at a 1 to 1. do you see what that implies?

The only **suscceful** investor who invest on this coin is the emitter(s) who control it. and this is factually obvious: it make them billionaire on less than 6 months. (Forbes). 

So, 
Although I have no particular interest in the debate that this tweet raises concerning the subject to which it is applied (and i fell curious about the defensive behavior that it provoked), I am embarrassed by the relevance of its content for the case of the source who publishes it here (BNB related).

EDIT:
> he's not anonymous and is part of a team

Objectivity: i talk about the BNB and it s emitter (the Juridical person), so, if you have any argument about that i refer you to this kind of question, where you can help: http://www.letmegooglethat.com/?q=where+binance+is+located

you agree at least that it is one of a basic and legit question for any investment decision ? so, tell me, who will invest without such basic information ? the ""insiders"" who already invested of course.";1;0;False;GLPReddit;dxz6z2m;We did it!! BTC ✌️;8euc9s;https://i.redd.it/9815n38hn2u01.jpg

"Block reward gets cut in half in about every 4 years, its called the ""halving"".

Right now when a block is found, 12.5btc get released, its estimated in 2020 the next halving will happen and only 6.25btc get released, so imagine on 2040, only 0.1953125 btc will be released per block.... gonna take a long time to mine the rest of all the coins to 21 million when every 4 years less and less coins are released. 

Each halving should have an effect on price as well, making the price go up because there are less new coins from miners to sell to the market, that is if everyone is hodling.";5;0;False;tranceology3;dy0nqm9;17000000 Bitcoins Have Been Mined! 4 millions to go!

"That is a good question.

When Bitcoin first appeared, everyone saw it as the only cryptocurrency in the world. Today's reality is very different from 2009. There are a few dozens of cryptos which are now accepted for payments. Bitcoin is no longer the only player in town.

Won't people just hodl? Well... that is a big incentive, but you have to eat and drink, right? Pay the bills, etc. One way or another, you will have to spend money to buy stuff you need. You will have a big incentive to save, but there will also be need to spend some money to fullfill your daily needs.

This is all, of course, assuming that BTC will be the only one, which current facts begin to contradict.

Currently, people hodl, because they have the incentive of value appreciation, and they spend instead their USD/EUR/JPY/GBP, for example.

But I'm now currently very sceptical about all the crypto ecosystem. From the moment that merchants are accepting multiple cryptos, will we trully have a crypto-scarcity? Bitcoin value speculation is based on it's 21M limit. But from the moment there's a large amount of cryptos being accepted, do we truly have that limit? I'm beginning to question that.

- People lose stuff - like the one famous guy accidentally dumping his harddrive with 7,500 coins in a landfill. 
- One could also accidentally send it to wrong addresses, that no one has access to. Especially possible in the beginning when the tech was less user friendly - e.g. the handling of change addresses (worth reading up on).

Yes, that is perfectly valid. But I wonder how the market will react once Bitcoin start's to become more scarce. Will the market simply turn its attention to other cryptos? It is very plausible in my opinion.

Msrp for the 1070 was $379. They're selling for almost 30% more than that. At any rate, this is the worst time to buy a card.

"> Fair, but even with Bitcoin being top dog, whenever it fluctuates in price so does everyone else to an extent.

Well, that's the thing. Most of the BTC fan-boys believe that other cryptos rise, because their value is established by being paired with Bitcoin. In my opinion, that is far from the truth.

By analysing the charts at Bitfinex, when market pumps happen, they usually happen in all the cryptos, sometimes before bitcoin is pumped, sometimes after.

I honestly don't believe that other cryptos value is correlated to the bitcoin value in USD. In my opinion, this is just traders dispersing investment through several cryptos pairs, in order to access the maximum liquidity, so that when it is time to get the profit out, they are able to do so without completely crashing the market and hence, maximizing their short-term profit.

To conclude, in my opinion, professional traders don't have a special relationship with Bitcoin. They only care about the daily high-trading volume in each crypto trading pair, and make their investments accordingly. 

> Obviously if bitcoin were to completely fall off the charts then people would begin looking elsewhere, so I guess the answer to my question is that everyone would just find something better
