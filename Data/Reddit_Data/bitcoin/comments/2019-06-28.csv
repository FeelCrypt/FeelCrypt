I don't have any money but given time it'll be good. When it has remained flat for an extended period of time you can bet that's going to be a low price. But once it starts rising you don't know when the dip is coming, and at that point it's always fairly soon. So now your best bet is to ride it out at least until it turns green again. Same way you would have had to wait and wait if you had bought during the flatline. There are no shortcuts to tell you when to buy and sale, and playing that game you will eventually lose even if you're lucky enough to gain big over the short term. And that's drives the lions share of the volitility to begin with. Because people yawn at the flatline and then get all excited when it starts rising. Driving the price higher faster than long term can sustain. Just hang onto it. Long term this is really no worse time than any other.

In my opinion BTC should try to become a stable liquid currency. So neither inflationary nor deflationary.

Should be possible quite easily. Just let the machine make some calculations regarding activity of the wallets. If the wallet hasn't sent anything for X years (maybe 10) , these coins will be added to the mining pool.In case wallets send coins after they are deemed lost, these are counted negatively towards the circulating supply -> They won't lose them if they just don't use them.That will lead to a quite stable amout of liquid tokens (BTC), of cause, you might get above 21 Million in liquidity for short amounts of time but you also don't punish people for spending Bitcoin as a currency so much.

Example: No tokens have been sent from the Satoshi wallet for 10 years. They are added to the ""mineable tokens"" and are released slowly. Suddenly someone sends a token from the Satoshi-wallet. The release of these tokens stops and until there are again less than 21 million tokens accessed over period x (ten years), the machine will not issue new BTC via mining.";1;0;False;Behind_You27;es94ioj;bought at $13,300 yesterday;c6ai69;https://i.redd.it/pc3rdm17ky631.jpg

"No there doesn't. You could have a steady rise with people using crypto as a savings method and putting in the same amount after each paycheck and spreading out buy orders over time rather than going ""all in"" after they see a huge green bar. There could be people using bitcoin to buy real things and do remittance, and some recievers not selling it all so it effectively acts as savings. That is how the price goes up and stays up without anybody getting hurt.

Or better yet, you could have people saving money and committing to keep a certain ratio of assets in their portfolio. So when price drops they buy more bitcoin and when price rises they sell, just enough to rebalance. Then there would be liquidity in the market and prices would be stable.

But psychology dictates people would rather buy a lottery ticket worth 50 cents on the dollar rather than an insurance policy worth double. They would rather play a slot machine than invest in the casino.

Lol, you can be as defensive as you want, hopefully you make money, but you are arguing against facts because you feel that an idea you have built a lot on is being attacked. That's a normal human reaction.

What do you mean why it doesn't affect the alts? It does, it's just that there is far less demand for alts now after the 2017 pump, and so you can't get people to FOMO in like you can with bitcoin, along side the liquidity. If you go and look what happened during the 2017 pump, Alts pumped too. Everyone can get fooled by the lofty dreams of bitcoin, most people aren't willing to risk significant capital on the Alts even if there is some price movement, but it still happens and the charts show that.

I'm not going to back and forth with you any more. If you want to educate yourself on the role tether plays in inflating bubbles so that exchanges can profit and leave people holding bags, do so.

The point of the video is that bitcoin reached various highs throughout it's life, then each time it crashed it eventually peaks again with each peak being higher than the previous peak.

Pick any peak in time along the chart and try to predict that it's the last and final peak ever and it will never peak past that again. In all cases in the past you would have been wrong.

"I'm in the same boat.  I placed a $5k order at $13,284. 

In 2017 (and earlier) I would dollar cost average my BTC investment, because that's what I could afford to do at the time.  I ended up making about $1500 doing this.

Now that I'm at a point where I can make bigger investments I saw the rally and though ""why not put in a bunch"".  And then it bit me in the ass and now I'm currently down ~$1000.

This broke all of my old rules.  I would never invest a large sum at once, and I would never invest near the top of a spike, no matter the price or momentum.

The options I have now are to:

* Leave my investment in there until the price is at a point where I can break even, and then pull out my investment, or continue to wait until it breaks out to make a profit.
* Pull out early for a loss

What you do will depend on your financial needs.  If you can afford to leave the investment in, do it.  Don't pull out if you're not worried about how long it will take  to recover your initial investment.

If you invested more than you can afford to lose, then it might make sense for you to cash out early and take the loss.  If you can make it back in a few months and still have savings, maybe you hold.  If it will take you longer or you don't have emergency savings, maybe pull out.

Personally I'm going to hold no matter what.  I know that in a couple of months I will have made back my investment with my day job and I didn't blow through my savings to make the investment.

I did learn a valuable lesson through this.  Head my old rules to DCA and never in lumps larger than what I normally put in savings every month.";3;1;False;Castratikon;es7p3p3;bought at $13,300 yesterday;c6ai69;https://i.redd.it/pc3rdm17ky631.jpg

Buy low and sell high!  I sold at 13k after buying at 3k, and that's just one way to make money. Of course it could rebound over the next week and go well above 13k who knows.  For me, I want it to go back down to 3k so I can invest again. It may not go down that far, and if it hits bottom at 5k, for example, then I'm in and investing. If you want to be smarter, then invest month after month and ride out the lows and highs over the long term, but really we don't know that bitcoin is going to continue to go up over the next decade as it could be over-valued right now, and that's why you don't see many taking that strategy.  My 2 cents. With volatility the way it is it isn't hard timing the market because you're never going to get a 400% increase in the stock market over 8 months, and I just did it with Bitcoin.

Sounds like it was a purchase based on emotion. If you can afford this then you can just ignore it for 5 years. The decision was already made so you might as well stick it out. It'll likely go higher later. The real cost of bitcoin investing is stress and lost time focusing on the price. The people who do well are the ones who don't care and just ignore the price for long periods of time. You should research risky and volatile investments because most people enter them knowing that the asset will probably drop below their purchase price for long periods anyways.;1;1;False;strange_fate;es7mxyn;bought at $13,300 yesterday;c6ai69;https://i.redd.it/pc3rdm17ky631.jpg

"I'd say just wait several days. In general though the single *most important* thing in this business is: don't invest more than you can afford to lose. If you stick with that, you'll weather most of the storms. If you invest too much, you'll be *subconsciously* jittery and afraid, and will follow with the *wrong* decisions like clockwork. It's a bit like the Bible says: if you have a lot (i.e., you can afford), you'll have even more, but if you have little (you cannot afford), you will lose even the little you have.

The insidious part of all that is that those decision influences are rooted in the subconscious, you are not really aware of them (while studying TA charts up the ying-yang).

"This is all horrendous advice /u/nexcyus - in most cases you'll want to do the opposite of what he says.

Never go all-in would be a fair statement, but saying don't go all in at a 'high' is a ridiculous statement. How can you know when I high is? It's definitely possible 13000 could seem low in a few months time (or high).

DCA is generally a good idea, but if you genuinely believe you're at the bottom of a bear market or the start of a bull market, you may want to reconsider. The bull market *could* continue for a while so I wouldn't say your decision is a horrible one. Funny how /u/terbytetron says 'find a good entry point' - THAT'S THE OPPOSITE OF DCAing! Furthermore, no one knows dec/jan was the best entry point until it was clear we were in a bull market - we didn't know that until march. And then you couldn't buy at those low prices anymore. Furthermore, if the bull market continues (a decent likelihood, the bear market lasted one year after all) it'll be back up above 13400 soon enough; you wouldn't have to wait 3-6 months.

>BTC rallies are high, but will come down just as equally

Not quite. That's the case with pump and dumps. Not the case with Bitcoin, stocks, commodities, and anything with a decent market cap & liquidity.

>Don't daytrade (or weektrade) if you don't know what you're doing

None of them know what they're doing. Over 50% lose money!

HODLing is also horrible advice. Buy if you think prices will go up over the forseeable future (not week, but maybe 3-12 months). Sell if you think it'll go down.

Loses are already there whether you've sold or not. It's not a taxable loss. But don't spew the 'it's not a loss BS'. The value is whatever the current value is.

"FWIW I'll offer my not so professional analysis with the current indicators because I see quite a few people here who tried to jump onto a moving roller coaster and got hurt badly. There's still a good chance you can at least recover your losses...

Disclaimer: I am not a professional trader and I'm not offering financial advice. Trading in any market comes with risks so be sure to invest only with money you can afford to lose. 

A little background: I've been trading cypto since August 2018. I studied technical analysis about six months before I even thought about buying any crypto assets. I chose crypto because it had a really low barrier to entry. The fees were not bad for using small amounts of money to learn to use indicators with lines of support and resistance to make decent profitable trades. I've made many mistakes which cost me a little bit of money but I've been lucky to have a bull market start right as I was beginning to understand what I was doing and thus far my account has been growing.

Recently I took a break right before the latest major correction. I saw bitcoin rising quickly on Sunday, but my trading plan does not allow me to buy on a movement. So I looked for other opportunities and entered a brief trade in ETH and XRP. I made a nice 7% from both trades and then I took a break. So I missed the correction. Not bad for a novice.

So with that said I'll share what I see on my daily charts for bitcoin. 

My methods: I use MACD, Stochastic RSI and a 9 20 50 period exponential moving average to assist with assessing market conditions. I also use trend lines and zones of support and resistance I have drawn looking through different time frames.

My analysis: Bitcoin hit a high sell zone at about 13820 and suffered a strong rejection forcing the price down to 12079 which I had previously mapped out as a level of support. The price as of this post is riding along a line of support mapped out 11175. The candle looks to be a consolidation candle right now and the 15 minute chart shows the price testing that line of support. If the price pushes through there I expect it will continue to go down maybe far enough to test a line of support at 10279. The daily chart appears to confirm this on the MACD and Stochastic RSI. However there is a tendency for an asset that hits the 9 period EMA without touching the the 20 day EMA to reverse direction if this is the case I expect the price to test that 13820 zone again.



Conclusion: Today the price is consolidating at 11175 with a good possibility that the price will retest at 10279. If the price breaks upward between now and tomorrow it will likely test resistance at around 13820. If the price fails to break through there could be another and possibly larger pull back. 

The 9 20 50 EMA still shows the market to be in a strong uptrend and the price has a large amount of divergence from the 50 period EMA. This was not a very strong correction... yet. We should all be prepared for that to happen at some point during this bull run and set a stop to prevent losses even if you're holding longer term. I see quite a few people here who hadn't considered what they would do if the price drops and at what point the they should cut losses. The market isn't going anywhere and you can always re-enter under better market conditions.

Anyway I hope that wasn't too long or preachy at the end. I hate losing money and I share anyone's pain to go through that. So do your homework and have a plan.

"Dollar cost averaging does not affect your probability of winning/losing money it just pisses more of it away on fees.

It's a classic gamblers fallacy to think that you can game chance (say the roulette wheel) by making 10 small bets instead of 1 big bet. The EV is exactly the same, and the difference in variance is irrelevant when you're talking about an asset most people hold for at least a year at a time. Introduce a betting fee and now the EV is worse for spreading out bets because you're losing more for each bet.

Variance only matters for a game like Poker whereby you are at a significant disadvantage if you are short stacked, and winnings are structured so you can win money just by outlasting other players, in which case keeping your variance low can increase your EV. For a game where your stack and survival makes no difference, variance makes no difference except how fast you're going to win/lose your money.

If you value your time at anything its quicker and cheaper just to make one big bet. Course gamblers frequently believe in these sort of betting strategies because they easily confuse higher variance with lower EV since the psychological impact of a big loss is more significant than lots of little losses.";1;1;False;suninabox;es9dyej;bought at $13,300 yesterday;c6ai69;https://i.redd.it/pc3rdm17ky631.jpg

"I'm new to investing like this but I think bitcoin may be a very predictable volatile stock.  Basically, just wait until it goes vertical, cash out a small portion, then wait for the next dip, buy back in...  

I've gotten ridiculously lucky with my timing of selling.  I bought in a few hundred Sept 2016 completely forgot about it, then bitcoin all of a sudden was in the mainstream news in Dec 2017, I checked my bitcoin and was like HOLY FUCKING SHIT BATMAN and I sold at 95% of it at $18k then thought nothing of it...

Then at work in 2018 I got my boss to add a Bitcoin option to our website in Nov and we made $1400 in bitcoin when bitcoin was at $4k, bitcoin then dipped to $3k and my boss busts into my office and says, ""We lost 10% of our value in just one week, WTF?  Cash us out before we lose all of it!!!""  I tried to get him to hold but he was like, ""Cash us out!!!"" So then I said, ""Fine, I'll buy your bitcoin at 95cents on the dollar which is better than you'd get with conversion fees.""  He was like fine.  So I bought it.

Fast forward 7 months and then this happened
https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/c62c4u/boss_sees_bitcoin_today_after_panicking_and/

I sold some of my bitcoin when it hit $13k.  My logic was probably idiot logic.  I noticed the same thing that happened in December 2017 was happening now.  All of the mainstream media jumped on Bitcoin's dick.  Everybody on TV was talking about it and I just remember this thing about always doing the opposite.  So, because the lame know-nothing media was on Bitcoi0'sn dick and everyone is  talking about the 17 yr high, etc, I figured, meh, I'm gonna cash out the $1400 I bought in at in November...

After reading your post, what I need to do is analyze the charts and stats etc for both circumstances including knowing all those fancy terms analysts fling around... then recognize when the event happens again.

So, next time Bitcoin just goes vertical crazy I'm going to day-trade it, I'm going to cash it the fuck out at the high then buy back in again at the dip.  But i need to wait for the ""right"" highs and then figure out how to set the right lows.  Maybe only do it for serious verticals that not only go vertical but they go vertical for X period of time in correlation with other financial stats that indicate it is overbought and a correction is coming.  in any event, Your post helped me think about this in a different light. I have to stop getting lucky and I have to learn to put thought behind all of this...";11;5;False;harrysapien;es97e1u;Two types of Bitcoin investors;c6hj0d;https://i.redd.it/hmvddlxb12731.jpg

"that is what I need to learn study... My gut feels that it's not so much about knowing the exact tops and bottoms but rather knowing the conditions that are a pre-cursor to a rise and fall.  I think mathematically, if you set a stringent enough initial conditions and boundary conditions, then you should be able to be profitable doing this. 

What I mean is, you wait for serious porno boner level vertical rise and then you know a correction is coming so you then sell the second that boner goes south...  Then the correction is probably going to be 10% or more so you set a limit of where you buy back in, lets say 10% is the line and then you ride the rollercoaster down past 10% and keep riding until the ""first"" uptick happens then you buy back in...  Sure, maybe you don't hit the top top or the bottom bottom but as long as you are selling high(er) and buying Low(er) it should make you good money...

again, I'm still a noob and probably when I put some serious study into this it very well may be that what I'm currently thinking is not possible...

"If you expect Bitcoin to even remotely compete with gold this is not a good strategy. The price right now, as the meme implies, is still extremely low to what most people here think it will be.

Assume you think Bitcoin will hit $100k in 3 years.
If you DCA every week or month until it reaches $100k your gains will almost certainly be lower than if you just bought in a lump sum right now. The longer the time horizon the higher the probability that lump sum beats DCA.

There's research that proves this. I'll try to find links. I had to do some research myself when I first started as an investment analyst out of college as well.

I still think Bitcoin's long term value is binary. It will either compete with gold or become a useful currency once it hits the peak of it's S curve or it will be worth zero. Remember, Bitcoin is currently only around 2% of the total market value of all mined gold at it's current price.

"Bitcoin has a total value of around 260 billion dollars at 13300. Gold has a total valuation of 7 trillion. If bitcoin rocketed up, vertically, to half the value of gold, in the next 2 years, you would make around 15 times your money. Which means, in order to afford a $250k car, and absolutely nothing else, not even the insurance, fuel, or maintenance on it, which is usually 5-10% of the value, you would need to invest $18k dollars today.

&#x200B;

To be rich enough to actually truly afford a supercar, i.e own a nice apartment/house in a good area, cover all yoru taxes, living costs, etc, and afford a supercar on top, you would need to invest a minimum of $100k today.

The US has weaponized the USD blocking countries from getting access to it if they don't follow the rules. Everyone is talking about a gold backed currency and China Russia India buying gold up like crazy. They will  still want to use something digital and Bitcoin mimics gold. So fiat is slowly failing.

I wish nothing but the best for you guys and hope bitcoin is a major disrupting force, but I don't see the wisdom in ""investing"" in currency.  Currency is for spending.  Bitcoin is still really bad at that purpose.  It's a fundamental flaw.  In order to be secure it needs to be computationally complex (aka ""slow"").  You can't have the benefit without the drawback.  They are intrinsically tied together and if either of those attributes change the currency becomes useless.

I'm feeling the FOMO really hard.  I laughed at bitcoin when it was $3.  Yes, I hate myself for not grabbing some.  But I invested in Vanguard mutual funds instead.

"Why are you restricting your valuation to a fraction of today's gold value? Bitcoin can be thought of as a digital form of ""gold"" as a store of value, certainly, but it can also behave as currency as well as a security. The size (in asset value) of the gold market is tiny compared to the securities market. What we are witnessing is the birth of a new investment asset class which is a rare event. Even rarer is that exposure to the early investment phase is public and not reserved for private bankers, wealthy aristocrats or blue bloods and their cronies. In an ironic twist large institutions still have been PREVENTED from participating due to lack of regulations, safety, insurance, etc. This industrial investment is still in front of us.

Bitcoin is programmed to be deflationary in a world of inflationary currencies. There is no mathematical reason Bitcoin cannot rise to $1Million per coin and beyond. Today's price for one coin is $11K, a far cry from the ""hundred thousand"" number you cite.

What will happen when average mom & pop investors can buy a bitcoin ETF in their 401K plan at work? What will happen when central banks realize they need to purchase bitcoin as they do every other currency (if they haven't already started).

Considering that digital economies seem to trend to ""winner-take-all"" markets with 1 or 2 major players, and considering Bitcoin has 60% market dominance right now, is there a logical reason to buy any other crypto asset than bitcoin and maybe one or two of the other largest alts?

Exactly, that’s why I like certain non-shit alts.  Like take the controversial Iota for example.  $13,300 invested would buy 33,250 units at today’s value.  If it turns out to be even 5% -10% of the backbone of Internet of things machine transactions by 2022-2025, the market value could cross a couple trillion.  If it did, the value per unit would balloon to $719.  719 * 33250 = 23.9 million dollars for 13k invested today.  Bitcoin has already had multiple “moons” and already been force multiplied out.  There are legitimate projects which haven’t hit their 1st moon yet, but have extreme potential to do so, and legitimate talent behind them.;8;3;False;spaceshipguitar;es9d38w;Two types of Bitcoin investors;c6hj0d;https://i.redd.it/hmvddlxb12731.jpg
