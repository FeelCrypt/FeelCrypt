Well I've asked through twitter and have gotten a no to accepting it as payment for minecraft due to all the issues it'd bring up through support. How about accepting bitcoin through gyft? You'd allow for gyft to sell minecraft gift cards like you do at various physical stores?;3;0;False;Onetallnerd;cgbcjsz;on r/bitcoin right now;1xulba;http://i.imgur.com/u5XFwvw.gif

"You weren't talking about weed dude. You said ""drugs"". The number of people that would agree ALL drugs should be legalized is extremely small. And you have to be an idiot to think you don't need mainstream America to get this thing really going. Yeah if you had one out of 100 of every man, woman, and child on the planet using bitcoin that would be 80 Million, but since most of the population of the world doesn't even have access to a computer, that's not realistic is it? Then take people age 0-14 and 65+ out of the equation. You aren't left with a very large pool to attract. You need to try thinking about some basic marketing principals. This thing isn't just going to fulfill it's potential on it's own. We have to steer it the right way. Your vision for bitcoin would give it a value about a 10th of what my vision would put it at. That doesn't mean your vision is wrong, but many would argue it's misguided and has somewhat childish priorities.";1;0;False;SilverShibe;cgb6eeh;I heard some guy in the restroom of a club talking about bitcoins.

I don't need a history lesson you idiot. My point has never been about the war on drugs or whether or not drugs should be legalized. I can tell this must be a passion of yours though, because you take every opportunity to point out that you don't thing they should be illegal. I don't give a shit. My only concern is the image of this technology. I want to make sure my investment is worth something at all in a few years, and a profit would be nice! All I know is, the demographic we need to take this thing from mediocre to through the roof is your average every day person. Stop saying we don't need them. It makes you sound stupid. ;1;2;False;SilverShibe;cgb61im;I heard some guy in the restroom of a club talking about bitcoins.

You don't know anything about me or my oppinion of drugs. My points are simply bringing a little thought of marketing principles to the discussion.;1;0;False;SilverShibe;cgb655w;I heard some guy in the restroom of a club talking about bitcoins.
