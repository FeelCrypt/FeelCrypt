">Depends on what your fees are, and if they're a fixed fee or a percentage fee

Blockchain transaction fees are relatively fixed, you can't get $0.0001 transaction fee just by sending $1, the more you send in one go the smaller a percentage the transaction fee is. unless there's an exchange out there willing to pay your transaction fee in exchange for a fixed percentage, which I'm not aware of.

>Automated DCA is a great strategy, and works whenever you're not great at evaluating risk, or do not care enough to try and time your buys

If you don't have any information on which to time your buys then spreading them doesn't change EV.

Only if you had information that right now the price is over-inflated and is likely to go down in future would spreading it out be advantageous. without information you have no more reason to believe now is a bad time than a good time, either way would be trying to time the market based on supposed insight that now is either a good or bad time to buy. If you don't know whether now is a good or bad time you should just make one large bet to reduce the amount spent in fees.

In fact if you believe the long term trend is up then waiting is hurting your EV, since its more likely to be higher in the future than it is now.

If you have no informational advantage there is no benefit to pissing away EV under the illusion that lowering variance improves your EV.";1;0;False;suninabox;esc6oh3;bought at $13,300 yesterday;c6ai69;https://i.redd.it/pc3rdm17ky631.jpg

ALL of crypto is a long shot, but there are divisions to be made between ones with more promising use cases than others, and a division between who has already mooned 14 times and who hasn’t.

When you buy 1 Miota (the unit that trades) it breaks down to 1 million Iota’s.

"When the “looming collapse” is mentioned, it refers to the fact that it remains as a realistic theoretical threat. The 2008 crisis proved just how close the world economy got to the edge of collapse. And despite all the regulations (which are being rolled back) and safe guards and stress tests put in place to prevent another financial crisis, the threat remains that central bankers will lose control of monetary policy because banks, traders, speculators, hedge funds, are all craving higher returns every year. To keep them happy, to keep shareholders happy, to keep board of directors happy, central bankers need to maintain a loose monetary policy. That system works.... until it doesn’t. And just when we approach the edge of collapse again, governments and central bankers do the one thing to stave off collapse: print more money and call it a “loan”, of “stimulus package”, or “quantitative easing”. They’re really nothing more than giant financial drips of adrenaline injected into the economy to keep us just off the edge of collapse.

Because this has happened, and continues to happen, and will happen again, Bitcoin acts as insurance of your wealth today because its fundamental structure is outside of the established global financial system. Bitcoin exists and will continue to accumulate in value because the theoretical threat remains (not that it will actually happen but that it can happen) that collapse is just around the corner. 

In the case of an actual collapse, where central banks print tons of cash but where it does nothing to help private banks’ balance sheets, the world will turn to bitcoin: a network that doesn’t belong to any one single entity, where its decentralization will have become wider and of greater ease of entry as technology gets better. I envision mining to be come fully automated and run by AI, maintained by renewable energy that would still keep going despite a societal collapse.";1;1;False;Ttatt1984;esc1uov;Two types of Bitcoin investors;c6hj0d;https://i.redd.it/hmvddlxb12731.jpg
"the dollar goes through inflation annually...
U.S. Inflation Rate, $100 in 1800 to 2018
The dollar experienced an average inflation rate of 1.38% per year during this period, meaning the real value of a dollar decreased. In other words, $100 in 1800 is equivalent in purchasing power to about $1,992.91 in 2018, a difference of $1,892.91 over 218 years

Timing the market is extremely difficult and can bring a lot of frustration and stress - besides potentially making you lose even more money. If you believe the price will continue climbing (with its ups and downs along the way), hodling is the simplest strategy.

Besides: in Germany if you hodl for more than a year you can sell your bitcoin tax free. So that is also a major advantage (at least here).";14;0;False;nerfchips;esbirby;What an initiation;c6rj8s;https://i.redd.it/ruo5cnn3o6731.jpg

Sure, it might seem fine buying in at 19k if you plan to hold until it's 50k. But you could have bought over 5 entire coins for that same price if you waited to buy at $3500. So is it really fine?

Im new but from reading and looking at past behavior I think it will raise. It seems steady right now. My first time buying was around 10k and I almost sold at 13k because i thought it was gonna tank and I should have because it did, and bought back in when it did. I bought more at the dip around 11.5k so I'm looking good now if it starts skyrocketing like that again I'm going to attempt to sell and buy back in. Either way, I'm hodling just want to see what I can do to increase earnings. Wont buy again till a big crash.;1;0;False;tylerbisdope;escxnr8;What an initiation;c6rj8s;https://i.redd.it/ruo5cnn3o6731.jpg
