In and of itself, no: a dollar bill has no value. It‚Äôs just a piece of paper. 

But it‚Äôs also incorrect to say that it only has whatever value the US government says it does.

It has 80 years of a bedrock currency, with all sorts of infrastructure tied to it. 

BTC isn‚Äôt replacing that anytime soon. Even in the best of worlds, where it replaces the dollar as the international medium of choice, it still has no history of safety, and that is something by definition cannot be created quickly. In fact, at the moment it has the exact opposite. 

So: while the dollar has no inherent value...it also has enormous inertia, that is not valueless, even if it isn‚Äôt priced by the market per se.";4;0;False;whistleridge;ervgtfq;2018 vs 2019;c42kig;https://i.redd.it/25cgvhwb53631.png

"100% agreed there are many ""early adopters"" that don't much care for the currency angle and are more about trying to make easy money, which is only human. That said, ""inherent value"" is subjective. Does USD have ""inherent value""? Not really, being ""backed by US gov"" doesn't mean much, as the US Gov doesn't back what 1USD will be able to purchase. Does gold have inherent value? Well it's tangible and people like to ""do stuff"" with it which makes them willing to pay $$ for it. But how is that different from say an intangible like a copyright? People ""do stuff"" with a copyright, and people will pay for that use.

"That's not a reason, that's a justification. Subtle but real difference.

Example:

* Reason: multiple governments have agreed to accept tax payments in BTC

* Justification: Facebook is talking about making its own coin

People on here talking about BTC's value aren't looking at it as the potential currency of the future, they're looking at it as a get-rich-quick scheme in the here and now. BTC is not an asset; it has no inherent value. Therefore, they're treating it as an investment vehicle. 

But as an investment vehicle, it's a terrible idea. It masquerades as a high-risk high-reward investment, but it's really just an unregulated mechanism for sophisticated players to repeatedly fleece the greedy and gullible. Study the history of the stock market in the late 19th century, and you see the exact same patterns. 

BTC is the new version of buying the Brooklyn Bridge. 

Need more proof? Look no further than the blurb in the sidebar:

>Bitcoin is the currency of the Internet: a distributed, worldwide, decentralized digital money. Unlike traditional currencies such as dollars, bitcoins are issued and managed without any central authority whatsoever: there is no government, company, or bank in charge of Bitcoin. **As such, it is more resistant to wild inflation and corrupt banks**. With Bitcoin, you can be your own bank.

This post is literally about how it is undergoing wild swings in value. It's not quite inflation in the classical sense, but in any meaningful sense, that's exactly what's happening. 

Note: this is not saying it *can't* be better. It's saying it's *not right now*.";5;2;False;whistleridge;ervadgk;2018 vs 2019;c42kig;https://i.redd.it/25cgvhwb53631.png

It has some of the needed properties for sustaining financial bubbles (in particular, it's very hard to increase the supply in response to an increase in price). It's relatively censorship resistant. It's a good approximate solution to an impossible trustless distributed consistency problem. But that solution is by design as energy-intensive as can be profitably maintained. And many problems that can be solved trustlessly can be solved more efficiently with trust, if trust is possible. It's been put to some real uses, some of which are arguably good. I'd say it's the same as ever.;2;0;False;L33tminion;ertsil6;Eleven;c3p80e;https://i.redd.it/07te6jshxe101.jpg
