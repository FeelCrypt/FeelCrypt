"Lmao. You can't make a camel drink as they say. Don't bother looking. Snopes probably already debunked it right? The CIA would never overthrow a democratically elected president to install a dictator they control. Or fund terrorist groups to create unrest in certain areas. All just tin foil conspiracy! 

Honestly though I envy you because there's literally nothing I can do with this knowledge. No one cares and if you start talking about it you get accused of being another Alex Jones wacko and keeping the tin foil industry in business. Which I don't understand since the NSA already has all the backdoors they need on the motherboards and processor chips. What good is tin foil going to do??

">did you fail to use language properly

No. Not a difficult question. I proved my answer above, I am waiting for a rebuttal.

>now expect that everyone else should cover for yore mistakes

Everyone else? No, everyone else seems to have understand what I was saying and nobody questioned me. Only you failed, singular. Nobody else is reading this post's thread now.

"Awe, did you fail to use language properly and now expect that everyone else should cover for yore mistakes?

What's the context behind your continual failure to make a salient point while still seeing value in your own contributions?

"**Principle of charity**

In philosophy and rhetoric, the principle of charity requires interpreting a speaker's statements in the most rational way possible and, in the case of any argument, considering its best, strongest possible interpretation. In its narrowest sense, the goal of this methodological principle is to avoid attributing irrationality, logical fallacies, or falsehoods to the others' statements, when a coherent, rational interpretation of the statements is available.
