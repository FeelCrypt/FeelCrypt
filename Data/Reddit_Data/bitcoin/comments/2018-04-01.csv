">""It is very possible that, at some future point, we will come to regard these policies as tragic mistakes and adopt less punitive and more effective methods of reducing the incidence and costs of drug use,"" the judges wrote.

Yes, this is what my whole argument hinges on. The drug policies are draconian and unjust. Ross' biggest crime was creating a tool to allow people to circumvent these drug policies to freely trade narcotics. Was it illegal? yes. Was it immoral? no. Thousands of people die every year in the US due to drug violence. Specifically due to organized gang violence that is connected to the drug trade. Drug trade doesn't have to be so deadly if the consumer is linked directly to the producer, avoiding the violent middleman. The drugs were delivered from Mexico to Australia? Good. Whoever needed drugs got them without involving a vast criminal enterprise that kills, kidnaps, and tortures people along the way. 

Did he procure or deliver any drugs himself? No. Did he even touch any of the drugs? no. What the Feds are so butthurt about is the fact that drugs delivered via the silk road cannot be intercepted and the drug money cannot be seized like it can be when traditional routes are available. You can't seize bitcoin and you can only intercept mail which isn't attached to any individual while in transit. It was a brilliant idea. The only way to stop this was to nail the facilitator: Ross. 

Did he put hits out on people? maybe, but whoever he may have killed prevented thousands of deaths related to organized drug trafficking crime. If the war on drugs was really about preventing suffering, Ross would be at the bottom of the list of the DEA priorities. Instead, he ended up being a martyr for a good cause.";1;1;False;ghettospagetti;dwlm052;Today it's Ross Ulbricht's 5th birthday spent in prison. Happy Birthday Ross!
