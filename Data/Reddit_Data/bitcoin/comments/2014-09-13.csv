"My other reply looks pretty unhelpful to your question. I was on my phone and actually thought you were replying to my comments in a different part of the thread where I had already mentioned the AES encryption of the KeePass database. 

Using KeePass does put all of your passwords in one place, which creates a single point of failure, as you pointed out. But it is encrypted with 256 bit AES, which is discussed in the article I linked in my other reply to you. The encryption is very secure, to the best of my knowledge. 

The major weakness is that you could lose access to the database in case of a hard disk failure or something similar. For this, I recommend a good back up policy. I recommend that anyway, even if you don't use KeePass. Put your KeePass database on a USB key, back it up to the cloud, and back it up along with the rest of your hard drive. This is a very important database and you don't want to lose it. ";1;1;False;russkhan;ckgw8kr;Applepay, keeping your payment history secret...;2g6mcq;http://i.imgur.com/17rR3VI.jpg
Multisig isn't any more complicated (check out GreenAddress). It's basically the same as an online wallet you use on your phone, but your phone itself has to sign a transaction together with the online server. To the user it's no different from Blockchain.info or Coinbase. So chance are that average users who are paranoid about security will want someone countersigning on their transactions, same as they got used to banks checking their transactions. ;1;0;False;Rassah;ckhfpma;Applepay, keeping your payment history secret...;2g6mcq;http://i.imgur.com/17rR3VI.jpg
