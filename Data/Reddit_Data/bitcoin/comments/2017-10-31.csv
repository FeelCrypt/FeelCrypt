"""Eliminating socialized junkmail"" =/= ""lack of infrastructure"", but false equivalency is the government shill's greatest ally, after all.

You are delusional, it's very easy to check how much money USPS has made, I suggest  you do that before shitposting. USPS works directly with FedEx and UPS and often times delivers packages for them, FedEx also rents USPS trucks sometimes. They all share airplanes too, because it's cheaper for them. Also USPS handles passports and you can call them and opt-out of junk mail. Simple phone call. ;1;1;False;NYCseverMutant;dp5pn2w;Bitcoin is going to do to banks what email did the post office and Amazon did to retail.;78uxpf;https://www.forbes.com/sites/briankelly/2017/10/24/why-bitcoin-matters-more-than-blockchain/?utm_source=followingimmediate&utm_source=TWITTER&utm_medium=email&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=20171023&utm_campaign=sprinklrForbesInvestorTwitter&utm_content=1125431648#5ae2449437ac
"Lending to a bank isn't a great business.

But banking is still necesary for society.

Who would want to take out a long in something like bitcoin?  That is designed for deflation.  Even if you assume the price of bitcoin is stabilizing global growth will still run 4-5% a year.  That will cause deflation in bitcoin.

So how would you borrow money in bitcoin to buy a house?  Even at a 0% bitcoin rate the bitcoin would be going up a rate of 4-5% a year while your house probably returns 2% a year (inflationary growth).  So therefore you are talking a real interest rate of 3% a year.  Every year it gets more expensive to pay back the bitcon you owe.  

Biggest issue with crypto is it can't work as a lending currency.";2;1;False;chitraders;dp5h1ps;Bitcoin is going to do to banks what email did the post office and Amazon did to retail.;78uxpf;https://www.forbes.com/sites/briankelly/2017/10/24/why-bitcoin-matters-more-than-blockchain/?utm_source=followingimmediate&utm_source=TWITTER&utm_medium=email&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=20171023&utm_campaign=sprinklrForbesInvestorTwitter&utm_content=1125431648#5ae2449437ac
"Maybe you live in the U.S. where everybody is taking loans, but in Europe this was not common until the last 10-20 years. Interest rates were high, reflecting the real long term price of money.

Regarding your question for now, I prefer renting over buying, as I believe that houses are overpriced ";1;1;False;xiphy;dp5uz6h;Bitcoin is going to do to banks what email did the post office and Amazon did to retail.;78uxpf;https://www.forbes.com/sites/briankelly/2017/10/24/why-bitcoin-matters-more-than-blockchain/?utm_source=followingimmediate&utm_source=TWITTER&utm_medium=email&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=20171023&utm_campaign=sprinklrForbesInvestorTwitter&utm_content=1125431648#5ae2449437ac
