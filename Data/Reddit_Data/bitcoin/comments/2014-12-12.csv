"I meant that you run Windows as a virtual machine on Linux. Modern CPU's have special instructions to assist with executing virtualized code, and hypervisors (virtual machine managers) taking advantage of these features can run OS's at 98-99% compared to native speeds, in real life you won't ever notice that your Windows runs in a virtual machine on a simulated hardware on Linux. It has nothing to do with piracy.

My point was that you can run Window on a Linux kernel. The WinXP kernel had special code to talk to the Linux kernel when it detected that it was running in a VM, it was a symbiosis between the two kernels, similar to what /u/CoppleAmputer was dreaming about.";1;0;False;tequila13;cmsacco;You can now buy Xbox credit with Bitcoin;2oxkgr;http://imgur.com/p7J3P0K
