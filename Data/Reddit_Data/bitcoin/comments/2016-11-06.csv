"Yeah medicine has made some pretty wild science experiments.  They can make a man look like a woman and vice versa by suppressing and taking different hormones.  

That doesnt change the gender of the individual though, it just changes what they look like.  A guy who cuts his dick off is still a guy, they have y chromosomes in every cell of their body.

This is the difference between genotype (Cant be changed) and the phenotype (can be changed with lots of hormones and drugs).  But go ahead and keep talking down to me about biology, you clearly displayed a great knowledge of the topic with facts when you implied that I'm the one ignorant of science, lol.";-1;1;False;ellenpaosanus;d9ors6k;Excuse me?;5bhru0;https://i.imgur.com/eXh8daN.jpg

"Sometimes they're funny, sometimes they're stupid.   Your last one was stupid, no context or good setup, about what a junior high kid in developmentally disabled classes might use.   That said, I don't actually have much attachment to pronouns, I ignore people pretty much regardless of whether they got it right or not.   

As to docs, you are in error.  MOST of the time what you write is true.  Some of the time... well, not so much.   All kinds of crazy screw ups can happen between the fetus' genetics, and the mom's endocrine system.   Its very rare, and very unfun when it happens to be you that is the screw up, but you don't get much say in whether or how that screw up will be you.    I fail to see the ethics in being cruel to people that are victims of such screw ups.

"Yeah there are some hermaphrodites but they are really rare as you were saying.  Most transsexuals just randomly identify as the opposite gender as some kind of teenage angst.  

The hermaphrodites are treated from early life, so they dont end up like bruce jenner looking and sounding like a man in a dress";-2;1;False;ellenpaosanus;d9oqxzs;Excuse me?;5bhru0;https://i.imgur.com/eXh8daN.jpg
"I think gender pronoun jokes are great, its funny as fuck that people want society to play into their game of make believe.  When a baby comes out the doctor says, its a boy or its a girl, the doc never says well lets wait till the baby is 16 and see what it identifies as.

There are a lot more than just hermaphrodites.  A LOT.    But you can proceed with your high school level biology comprehension of sex and gender in humans.    It makes little difference, medicine will continue to progress, hormone therapies are incredibly cheap and effective, not a dang thing people like you can do to stop it.    ;5;2;False;Becky_rw;d9or5b1;Excuse me?;5bhru0;https://i.imgur.com/eXh8daN.jpg
