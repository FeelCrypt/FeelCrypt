"If you invested your life saving at 20k you where obviously not paying attention to the actual long term development. That price was a mob rush from speculators and the main stream media pumping.. everyone trying to get in not understanding and expecting a lambo. 

If however you have been paying attention, and been steadily investing, your returns would still very much be in the positive even at todays ""low price"". BTC is far outperforming stocks and USD as far as retaining its value, you need to look at it wholelistically.

I understand its difficult if you are in the red now from investing at an all time high, but if you got in as a long term buy, believing in the technology, rhen you hold, and if things continue amywhere remoyely close to the past 9 years, you will be happy you bought at 20k. The market is highly volatile because its still very very early, its a small marketcap, much smaller than other regular assets like Gold, things will stabilize once we are more mature, both jn term of people rushing in, and tech, and regulatory adjustments, and the size of the network buffers things. But you knew this gettint in, no? You knew it was a wild rollercoaster of volatility, right? This is not new.

"What is this rule that there has to be one main coin? That’s like saying there can only be one main clothing brand, or one main restaurant. ETH has proven itself quite sufficiently to take itself out of “altcoin” status.

It’s funny that you mention history because that’s exactly what I’m using to make my analysis. There’s always an industry standard, then a newer better product or service comes and replaces it. But you’re saying that won’t happen with crypto?! If we actually let history tell the story then it’s somewhat likely that it will happen eventually. Why not begin with bitcoin? It’s initial inherent value was the Blockchain technology, but since other coins have picked up the tech and flourished they’ve proven that they no longer need bitcoin to exist. The only reason it continues to is that it was the industry leader for so long and people still assign an arbitrary value to it without really looking at the technology. Once people become more aware of the actual technology behind it and other coins this may change. Maybe that’s what’s happening now?

Im not saying ETH is the new standard or, if it becomes the new standard, it will always remain the standard, but it certainly looks like it will be a stronger and less volatile coin than BTC given the recent 3-6 month trend.

"Incorrect.  Pyramiding is simply an investment strategy intended to minimize the risk you lose your entire investment should the market tank.  Rather than invest all your capital at front, you invest small amounts over an extended period of time.  Buying this way has absolutely nothing to do with a pyramid scheme. 

A pyramid scheme relies on recruiting new users.  See multi-level marketing companies, or Bitconnect for examples.

There are a lot of reasons why I don't think we'll see anywhere near the same situation as 2013. First of all is the most obvious, after seeing the bounce from the last bear market many more people will be looking to catch the bottom. Secondly, BTC has become a lot more proven than it was back then, we have seen it taken a lot more seriously, with Futures etc. Thirdly, there are scaling solutions being implemented which should reduce congestion if we see another run up. Lastly, we have seen a lot more real use in blockchain, and the tech behind BTC being used in business. Although not directly tied to BTC, more use of blockchain tech is good, since BTC is still the most decentralised and secure coin. ;1;0;False;mattchstiks2;dtlv6gd;Looking at the price when you invested only what you can afford to lose;7uhyy5;https://i.redd.it/7n1u6eu21ld01.jpg

I didn't say anything about ones economic position remaining the same...Your economic position will always change with paper losses/gains, and even if you hold the same amount of money due to fluctuations in the consumer price index .

>what if you suddenly need to liquidate?

then go for it.

>you should always accept the fact that those unrealized gains may never ever come back and you lost out by not selling at $1,000,000.

I agree, you lost out on the **potential** of a $999,980 profit. if you sell an asset that you bought for $10 at $20, it doesn't change the fact you doubled your money.  although my mental health would be worse off knowing what I could have had.

">BTC by itself is really not worth anything,

Not true. Bitcoin provides a value in providing a way to transact money between people in a certain way. 

Part of that value lies in unique benefits it provides to those who choose to transact using it. Another part of the value is that it can in some ways (arguably) be a much more efficient way of doing certain things than the existing systems doing these things today (banks etc).

This means that bitcoin ""is worth something"" in the same way that for example Apple is worth something (it sells computers and smartphones that some people consider giving them unique benefits + it also sells computers and smartphones that can solve certain problems better than not using computer/smartphones can). Or similar to Walmart, which sells stuff cheaply and has an efficient distribution network. That's why shares of Walmart *are worth something*.

People who say BTC isn't worth anything only say so because the only thing they've comprehended about bitcoin is ""lol you can get rich buying it"", but there is a reason behind it all, and that reason is that bitcoin provides a valuable service.

Exactly how valuable, and how sustainable that value is in a longer run, and what the predicted future value of that service is, all these things are being negotiated by the market right now.

But to say it has no actual value is incredibly dumb (yet common).";2;1;False;probablite;dtm1k2a;Buyers and sellers today.;7ujhsh;https://i.redd.it/333nv3s4emd01.gif

"Not really ironic. It's actually a tautology.

If it doesn't reach that level, it will be because of a Black Swan event.

Black Swan events are common af. All it means is something unpredicted.

Bitcoin has been in price discovery mode this entire time; it's a new technology, and the ecosystem as a whole holds genuinely revolutionary potential imo. 

Bitcoins hash rate dominance (security) and standing means it's going to be around for some time yet, even if its primary role became simply being a base trading pair for the rest of the market.

At this point, I think the onus is on people claiming that the succession of price cycles is at an end to explain why they think that, more than on people saying that price cycles will continue baring an existential black swan event.

People who are so confident this will go to $3k, you know there's a futures market? Go short it. Downside $1,000, upside $100k great risk reward! Bitcoin is for people who don't trust government with money. The one lesson of the last 10 years (and potentially of the 21rst century) is that fascist and communist regimes don't protect property. They have more wealth than they ever had, more billionaires than they've ever had. The global banking system has never colluded more to ensure they can't store their value. Lightning and Decentralized Exchanges are coming. Market technicals are impossible to predict.

"Bingo.  8k pullback has been in the cards for awhile.  It never came.... until now.  

We'll likely overshoot a bit, but these are the days us smaller guys start accumulating again.  I'll buy this thing all the way down with little emotion, because there is no picking the bottom and it'll be multiples higher than the bottom once large money rejoins.

It's best to buy into a rally than trying to catch a falling knife or better yet sitting on big capital with limit orders setup and layered down, but it's not always realistic for those who have limited resources.  What's important is accumulation on significant corrections, such as the one we're experiencing now.

Bitcoin is still in a parabolic trend long term in my opinion.  Nothing has really changed (unless delusioned by bcashers or government fud).  Those who sell at 6k,7k,8k will have similar regrets to those who sold at $300 after ""poppin"" off of $1000.

The bigger and quicker the moves, the crazier the volatility and inevitable panic and profit taking.  This is crypto.



The question is will there be enough of a buying bounce to not drag this correction out for 1+ years.

"Your ""trading based on charts"" is literally a meme. I linked you an example in /r/wallstreetbets. 

Here's another way to practice ""trading based on charts"". Print out the chart and grab a quarter. Throw your chart away and flip the quarter. If heads, buy. If tails, sell. That has the exact same chance of working as what you're describing. 

It's fine to speculate in cryptocurrency if your argument is something like, ""I think amazon is going to start accepting bitcoin, which will increase public interest and drive up the price."" A shitty argument is ""just look at this microsoft paint analysis I did"". 


And this is coming from someone in early-ish. I first got my first bitcoin when it was actually used as a currency (on Reddit) in around 2012. I didn't get in when it was pennies, but I did when it was dollars. I sold at $17K. I don't have any right now because I like the idea of cryptocurrency, but bitcoin isn't used as a currency. Volatility - including increasing price - is terrible for a currency, because it discourages using it as currency and instead encourages speculation.

"**Benford's law**

Benford's law, also called Newcomb-Benford's law and first-digit law, is an observation about the frequency distribution of leading digits in many real-life sets of numerical data. The law states that in many naturally occurring collections of numbers, the leading significant digit is likely to be small. For example, in sets that obey the law, the number 1 appears as the most significant digit about 30% of the time, while 9 appears as the most significant digit less than 5% of the time. By contrast, if the digits were distributed uniformly, they would each occur about 11.1% of the time.

"I don't understand the hostility you're getting. Everything you say makes perfect sense to me and I've only been interested in the crypto market the last 2 months. Down a fair bit but no chance I'll sell - its a small investment so I don't have the same pressure which helps. I'm sure it will rebound because I believe in the technology and Bitcoin, as you say, is the flagship. No coincidence that all the alt coins drop when it does and vise versa. I may lose some money on the shitcoins I gambled on if they dissappear over the next while, but the tech is sound and not going anywhere. 

As far as FUD in the media, I don't get what people are talking about. All I see are positive developements of integration and adoption by major players. No idea when to buy more is but once it stabalises I'll put all I can into Bitcoin. Regulation doesn't scare me. It's a natural step and will probably simply involve tighter restrictions on buying and trading as well as targeted taxation or some such shit, but in my opinion money laundering and dodgy dealing will be harder with a public ledger than ever before (and this is the reason goverments quote as the reason to badmouth Bitcoin). I might be talking shit but I simply do not belive Bitcoin is going anywhere and once all the panic selling, or whatever is going on stops, it will recover. 

I invested for the future. For me that's 5+ years on a technology like this. Even longer. Not a week or any amount of time measured in hours.

1 .  we will reach a point in the future where there will be no spectacular crashes

or

2 . The bitcoin value will rise to infinity.

"Sorry, but you're wrong. We're not talking about a parabola, but an exponent. And the reality of any exponential function is that it does not matter when you examine it, it has the same, fractal property of starting with what appears to be a flat line, and then sharply rising towards the right end. 

The only thing that changes is the scale of the graph. See for yourself: put a 1 in cell a1, then make the cell below it twice it's previous (=a1*2) Copy the 2nd cell down 10 cells in Excel. Make a line graph. See how the slope changes? Now, copy another 10 and make a graph. Looks about the same, doesn't it? 

In economies, [exponential growth is so consistent that it can actually be used to identify bullshit information.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benford%27s_law). 

Since bitcoin is perfectly fungible and not based on any real world limitation other than the number of unmined coins, its maximum value could be written as something like: 

> total_World_Wealth / (Bitcoins mined - Bitcoin private keys lost) 

At some point, it becomes feasible to brute force private keys but I think we're still at least a few orders of magnitude away from that.

"**Problem of induction**

The problem of induction is the philosophical question of whether inductive reasoning leads to knowledge understood in the classic philosophical sense, highlighting the apparent lack of justification for:

Generalizing about the properties of a class of objects based on some number of observations of particular instances of that class (e.g., the inference that ""all swans we have seen are white, and, therefore, all swans are white"", before the discovery of black swans) or

Presupposing that a sequence of events in the future will occur as it always has in the past (e.g., that the laws of physics will hold as they have always been observed to hold). Hume called this the principle of uniformity of nature.

The problem calls into question all empirical claims made in everyday life or through the scientific method, and, for that reason, the philosopher C. D. Broad said that ""induction is the glory of science and the scandal of philosophy."" Although the problem arguably dates back to the Pyrrhonism of ancient philosophy, as well as the Carvaka school of Indian philosophy, David Hume popularized it in the mid-18th century.

"**Hot-hand fallacy**

The ""hot-hand fallacy"" (also known as the ""hot hand phenomenon"" or ""hot hand"") is the sometimes fallacious belief a person who experiences success with a random event has a greater probability of further success in additional attempts. The concept is often applied to sports, such as basketball. While previous success at a skill-based athletic task, such as making a shot in basketball, can change the psychological behavior and subsequent success rate of a player, researchers for many years did not find evidence for a ""hot hand"" in practice. However, later research questioned whether the belief is indeed a fallacy.

This needed a database for the photos. 17000 is nothing for a app I learned. Most people who become rich of apps spend about 50000 on the actual app and about 100000 for marketing. Myi did not knew that at the time and so I had only left 3000 for marketing which bought me exactly one review after contacting about 2000 journalists all over the world.they simply didn't respond because I was small-time and this is all friends politic. So they basicly ignored me. I also learned there are companies that exist from people like me and search for apps like mine. They copy the app and change it a little bit. So they did and only in that app you had to put your pinky in the photo. Later a widely known TV show implement the same app as a gadget in the TV show. And my app was gone since the marketing of the other guys was about 100000 and so my app was the one that looked like I was the one copieng them. They made a ton of money and closed the app down I believe after a year and moved on to the next one. So yeah that's basicly it. Closed it down because I've had to pay about 125 a month to keep it running. And afcourse the apple Costs 100 a year. It wasn't on Android because that would have cost me another 25000. And believe me the company I worked with was about the 10th I researched. Alot of other companies wouldn't even start below 50000 investment from my side. ;2;3;False;DannyG081;dtmhoxe;Lesson - History of Bitcoin crashes;7uqa54;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7uqa54/lesson_history_of_bitcoin_crashes/

I assume that you by that are referring to ""forming falsifiable hypothesis"". If that's the case the my answer is: some people at times would try because of bad reasoning. ""Trial and error"" doesn't put any requirements on the reasoning used to form of the conclusions. 

If you are referring to ""trials are repeatable, replicable and reproducible,"" condition: because of lack of education, bad reasoning and/or lack of time I would guess.

The scientific method is a form of ""trial and error"" but not all ""trial and error"" are the scientific method, this is an important distinction and that's why they are not equivalent. The scientific method puts extra requirements that are important for the justification of the results.

">I agree but in 2009 people sold because people said it would go any higher.

This isn't true. I agree with your sentiment, but it's important to note that Bitcoin did not have a fiat value till early 2010 when there were some early trades taking place in non-public locations (irc, forum pms, etc.) It wasn't till the famous pizza transaction that we had a public fiat value assigned, basically.

Also, the naysaying on Bitcoin's value didn't really get to be heavy till around 2011, when people were saying $2-3 dollars was too high and later when it went above $10 and higher they were also saying it was way overvalued. 

Of course, now that I say this, someone will find a post from 2010 where one guy says $0.50 was too high, but I guess the point is, it's a stronger argument to probably choose 2011 here as the time when ""people were saying it was bubbling"" or ""people said it wouldn't go any higher"". And to a certain extent, some of them were right, because it would take a very long time (late 2012/early 2013) before it did start going higher again.";2;1;False;Yorn2;dtmtn6z;Lesson - History of Bitcoin crashes;7uqa54;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7uqa54/lesson_history_of_bitcoin_crashes/

No it isn't.  An [argument from ignorance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_ignorance) is an assertion that something is true because it has not been proven false (or vice versa).

I never claimed that it will act a certain way.  In fact, I was arguing against that exact point.  My claim is that there is no reason to believe it will behave exactly like other financial instruments and therefore if you claim there is such a reason, the burden of proof is on you.

Not talking about wealthy people, talking about 65-yr old lifelong workers with $100-500k in savings for ~30 years of retirement to pay for.

Forgetting corruption and incompetence that caused the crash, the US dollar (and all country's currencies) is carefully manipulated by a few officials (the Federal Reserve for the US) who think they know better how to control monetary value than the complex orchestra of an organic free market. Whether they're right or wrong is irrelevant, they decide.  What we know is that $1 in 1950 now requires $9 to purchase the same thing today. That's the result of an inflationary debt-based economy that the Fed runs.

Many economists believe that a deflationary monetary supply is a better system.  Bitcoin subscribes to this system and more importantly is completely immutable and independent of any person or organization wanting to influence it.  It is a value transfer system, using an independently managed monetary supply that knows no borders.

The element of time only changes the credibility or ease of acceptance of the value the society gives the inherently worthless commodity, whether it be gold or bitcoin.

"**Argument from ignorance**

Argument from ignorance (from Latin: argumentum ad ignorantiam), also known as appeal to ignorance (in which ignorance represents ""a lack of contrary evidence"") is a fallacy in informal logic. It asserts that a proposition is true because it has not yet been proven false or a proposition is false because it has not yet been proven true. This represents a type of false dichotomy in that it excludes a third option, which is that there may have been an insufficient investigation, and therefore there is insufficient information to prove the proposition be either true or false. Nor does it allow the admission that the choices may in fact not be two (true or false), but may be as many as four,

true

false

unknown between true or false

being unknowable (among the first three).

"Worldwide market value of all the gold ever mined is somewhere around $7 trillion.  Worldwide market value of all cryptocurrencies was over $1 trillion at it's height, probably around 500 billion at this point.  So right now, the value of 'all the crypto' is somewhere near 1/10 the value of 'all the gold'.

Thought #1:  Wow.  This is amazing.  Look back over the last few years.  What was nothing is now something.  This is amazing technology, and the value is definitely proven.

Given the market cap of Gold, what is an upside of the future market cap of 'all cryptocurrency', particularly those, like Bitcoin, which do not correspond to actual physical assets?  Could we expect the sum of all the crypto in the world to be half of all the gold in the world?  Twice the value of all the gold in the world?  What can we base these claims upon?  We're comparing a virtual asset with a physical one, which is hard to wrap one's head around.

The more countries ban bitcoin, because they cannot track it, it will drop. The valuable part of Bitcoin is the Blockchain tech. and Blockchain tech is not Bitcoin.

"For me, I always looked at cryptos as fake money they were giving away on the internet as part of a pyramid scheme.  It's been almost a decade and BTC (along with other cryptos) are still absolutely shitty to use.  Cryptos are made for autists, by autists - until that changes they will never see wide adoption.  Reasons to use cryptos now:

 * You're in Asia (laff, y'all need to rise up against your shitty governments - get free idiots!) and want to wash your money
 * You think you can play the pyramid scheme better than the general public
 * You have a lot of it from buying early and want to gain real items

"1.	Unregulated markets are inevitably manipulated. BitCoin is entirely unregulated. So comparing its behavior to the behavior of regulated markets is risky at best and probably specious. 
2.	Of your 7 listed busts, 4 were because of hacks and/or resulted in bans. 
3.	A glance at the long term growth of BitCoin suggests this isn’t a bust, it’s a predictable - perhaps even planned - reversion to the mean. Using that, one would expect it to bottom out between $5000-$6000. 

BitCoin has no inherent value. If you’re not using it for illicit activity, you’re just holding it until one day in some prospective future when you can trade it back for ‘real’ currency. That is, people aren’t trying to get rich in crypto, they’re trying to get rich in dollars.

Bitcoin is worth exactly what people are willing to pay for it. It's an immaterial good, and that's really stretching the meaning of the word ""good"". Right now, that's about $7.5k.

Claims that BTC is dead (or even more stupid, that crypto is dead) are almost comical... back in 2013 when MtGox crashed, it was a believable statement, but right now? Kind of a stretch. There are hurdles in the way but if you really think they can crash the price to 0, you're not seeing straight. If you really did follow the first rule, it should be easy enough to wait this out.

"I have also been through bitcoin during all the crashes OP mentioned, first bought when they were $1 a piece. Yet I have a very different view. Buying now is not a good idea. Even if you believe bitcoin will continue to rise in the long term, which is admittedly far from unlikely, we are likely entering a bear market for quite some time. After all crashes that resembled this one, namely the ones in 2011 and 2013, we have hit lows of at least 20% of ATH, which would be around $4000 this time around, and it can easily go even lower than that.

And that is assuming the long term upward trend continue, which there is no guarantee for. It is very possible that this was actually the highest bitcoin will ever go.

If you've got enough money elsewhere to survive a full on crash, keep doing what you're doing. I couldn't care less. Maybe they're right - bitcoin could bounce back to 19k to 100k to a million. Anything is possible.

If you are financially depending on bitcoin's price rising again - you need to understand that it is *not* guaranteed. Not even close.

The technology is still there and it’s constsntly improving. With more developers working on its improvements than any other coin. 

 I also find it interesting that the media and people look at bitcoin as if it’s the only investment to ever crash this much.

The primary problem with this analysis is the use of data derived from market assets with intrinsic value (stocks, national currencies, bonds, commodity assets) to predict the performance of a collectable without any intrinsic value (digital currencies, beanie babies, baskets, baseball cards, comic books).  The volatility itself is precisely the hallmark of a collectable bubble - a bug not a feature - that may be exploited for great gain or suffered through at great loss.  To apply market analysis to Bitcoin as one would to Oil (commodities) or shares of Apple (stock) or Tbills (bonds) is to illustrate ones lack of understanding of both the market and the item - not the other way around.;1;0;False;encomlab;dtmk7qc;Lesson - History of Bitcoin crashes;7uqa54;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7uqa54/lesson_history_of_bitcoin_crashes/
"You might buy now but the odds of having your bet multiplied by 75 (for example from $266 to $20,000) are much lower. Do you think you're gonna see a value of $20,000 * 75 in the next decade? (It's $1,500,000).

So even if you buy a lot of it right now, you're not gonna bank as much as if you had invested when it was $266.

And that's assuming (because that's the only thing you're doing really) that it will go up again like it did before.

""Bitcoin biggest bubble in history, says economist who predicted 2008 crash"" 
""Nouriel Roubini, professor of economics at New York University, said bitcoin was “the mother of all bubbles” favoured by “charlatans and swindlers” as it fell below $8,000 (£5,600), marking a 30% drop since the beginning of the week as investors became increasingly twitchy about a clampdown on cryptocurrencies by regulators.

Bitcoin has lost more than half its value since hitting a peak of near $20,000 in the week before Christmas. Roubini said the sharp fall was the beginning of a crash that would see the value of the digital currency plummet “all the way down to zero”.

">Predicting that past behavior will repeat is the essence of the scientific method

Scientific method requires replicability and falsifiability, and control for variables.

Economics is a soft-science because you can't run proper experiments.

 You can run controlled experiments in a lab and try to extrapolate them to the entire world but they have low external validity because its such a simplified version of the economy. 20 college students in a lab can't properly replicate the behaviors of millions of people in the real world.

you can try to run experiments in the real world economy but there are so many variables they're very difficult to replicate. Economies are constantly changing so you can't say X will have the same effect on Y economy as Z economy. you can't get everyone agree to keep all other variables the same while we change variable X.

>entirely reasonable to extrapolate a pattern that has consistently repeated dozens of times, rather than predict that this time will be different

Correlation != causation.

You can't predict what the temperature will be in the future simply by looking at previous patterns in temperature. The weather is a complex multivariable dynamic system, you have to look at and understand all the relevant variables to make accurate predictions, which is why we struggle to make accurate predictions about the weather past a couple of weeks.

"I don't think that applies to a blockchain. 

Gambling is hoping that randomness lands in your favor.

Putting money in a volatile crypto like bitcoin is more akin to putting your money in gold or silver. However much more volatile. The underlying asset always has a use, therefore has some value. Never zero like gambling.

Cryptos by nature will always rise over time due to their finite nature and expanding use cases. That is what people do not get. 

The price is affected by CUV (current utility value) and DEUV (Discounted expected utility value).

CUV creates a baseline value. The price should not go under this. For example I can remit money across borders with bitcoin cheaper than a bank. That creates value. As use cases increase the CUV rises. (Insert many altcoins).

The problem is that we have monkey brains. So we add DEUV to the price. DEUV is speculation and it likes to create bubbles over the CUV line on a graph. Occaisionally the DEUV becomes too high and pops down to the CUV, which is happening now.

However we say buy the dip because cryptos always rise with expanding CUV. It is unfortunate when someone buys at the top of high % DEUV but if they wait, it *will* rise again.

Cryptos are an unstoppable force. Governments cannot stop them if they tried.";2;0;False;Ghost_In_The_Ape;dtn6xbq;Lesson - History of Bitcoin crashes;7uqa54;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7uqa54/lesson_history_of_bitcoin_crashes/

"Have a look at small cap stocks and compare them to large cap stocks. Large cap stocks have lower volatility. This is due to the fact that when an asset has a small market cap, it has a low base. For example, suppose an assets has a market cap of $100. Then if you add $5 then the market cap increases 5%. However, if the market cap is $1000 and then you add $5 then this is a 0.5% increase. The same amount of money coming in gives a lower percentage market cap increase for the asset with higher market cap.

1. I honestly have no idea what you are trying to say. Something about governments cracking down? Lol.
2. When the price goes down the difficulty of mining will adjust, or some miners will switch to other cryptos, so the remaining miners will indeed make enough money to make it “worth it”.

"> Why? 

Why? Because the same forces that caused the bubble to inflate in the first place works in both directions. The price in these situations rises when the positive feedback loop of new investors being attracted by the rising prices inflates the price further, attracting more investors. But exactly the same thing happens in reverse - a negative feedback loop - when the price is falling. 

There isn't an endless pool of buyers or money. At some point, the amount of money available for investment dries up. At that point, the bubble is no longer inflating. But what's keeping it inflated? The answer is, not much, if anything. And that means a dip can easily turn into a correction or crash - the price dips, some people decide to get out, negative feedback begins, and you have a crash.

In the absence of some fundamental reason for a price increase - e.g. a profitable company underlying a stock - it's inevitable that sharp increases will be followed by sharp drops. 

In the Bitcoin case, there are essentially no fundamentals - the price is not based on its use as a currency, but rather on the demand as a speculative investment vehicle. That's the main reason its price is so volatile. If it was really being widely used as a currency, the volatility would be damped out due to actual demand for the currency.

> Where is that golden rule written?

It has been studied and written about extensively, to the point that there are common quotes and phrases about it:  ""what goes up must come down,"" Warren Buffett's ""be fearful when others are greedy,"" as well as the terms ""correction"", ""bubble"", and ""greater fool theory.""

> IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT!

You're confusing two different things: it's impossible to predict when it's going to hit the top. However, *after* such a steep rise, when the price begins to drop, there's a high likelihood that it's going to drop a lot. And in fact the drop itself proves that a *lot* of people ""predicted"" exactly that - they were selling because they were worried it was going to drop further. If you want to protect your gains, you take profits. That's how investing works.

Here's some advice: don't let your ignorance about investing turn you into one of the [greater fools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_fool_theory). If you're going to invest real money, study the subject.

"Let me elaborate.

Monetary policy is changing money supply to suit the economy. In economics there are times you want to devalue your own currency. Inflation is a core mechanic to keep the economic engine running. Countries such as Greece who do not control their own money supply do not have a shock absorbig mechanism when shit falls apart. They cant devalue their currency to make their goods/services marketable. This is why a ""Greexit"" was talked about.

When the price goes down, difficulty of mining will not adjust. Difficulty adjust when the hash pool decreases. It will decrease only if miners exit the market due to price going down. But what im saying is how much it will cost the end user. The end user will have to pay by inflation on the crypto economy or transaction fees. The cost for running those ant miners far exceed the cost of a centralized computer. Somebody will pay. You might not feel the inflation from crypto but its there.

People buying bitcoin to help their wealth is pure specuation. Some people trade forex to scalp the market but the broader economy do not buy currency expecting it to go up. If your main currency is deflating, people will not spend money and hoard it. Thus halting economic activity beyond basic read and butter needs.

You dont need to perfectly time the market. You just need to be able to indentify what it is doing and the end game. Just a bunch of FOMO investors throwing their monry at something hoping to double it next month. To the MOON!!! LOL. You need to look at that and say... Fuck that shit... Or im entering with a tight stop. I am attacking those who litterally think this will get 1 mill per coin and replace 10% of all fiat currency because its not currency, not even close. Also nobody is selling gold and rushing into crypto. Its not even close to a store of value. You mihht have heard it from some retards on CNBC but look at gold prices.

Why do people need to use it? Because using it gives people a reason to keep it. Ever watch rick and morty where Jerry has some star wars coins. He thinks they are cool and collectable. He didnt buy them just because he expects to drive lambos at the end of the month. When prices fall, there is zero reason to keep bitcoin other than the greedy expectation than ""it will be back up"". For example if USD drops to 1 cent canadian. Then there will be a self stabilizaing mechanism. Canadians will buy USD and then use that USD to buy US goods at 99% discount. Money will flood into the US economy and prop up the dollar. Also americans cant afford to sell out because they need to remain liquid. You dont need to hold bitcoin to operate. It makes the market volitile and toxic.

You don't have to ""see the top"". When the price quadruples in a 90-day period, you have to figure a hard correction is very likely.  It makes sense to cash out a significant amount, if not 100%, if it starts crashing at that point.

"I never jumped on the bitcoin train, & honestly, I wish I would have. I was considering investing in Ethereum and Monero when I found out the drug cartels were using it. Honestly, it wasn't as mainstream as bitcoin so I figured once a news story or word broke on it, people would flock to it in time for it to grow and do some sort of quick sell. Never got into any of it though because as I dug deeper, cryptocurrencies are a dime a dozen.


I honestly think Bitcoin was at a high which will not be reached again. I'd like to stay optimistic because I feel my fellow Redditors are heavily invested into it. But I worry, and sometimes cringe when I keep reading posts of people willing to hold forever.

With nearly every crazy crash there is always a group of people trying to reassure others to keep holding. Word of advice to you guys.....
