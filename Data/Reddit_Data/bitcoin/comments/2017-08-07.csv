This is semantics. If you have monopoly on violence you are in fact a state.

They control turf, they charge rent in the form of taxes, what is really the diffrence?

">lol, THEIR PROPERTY. 

Exactly, their property. You used it, but its ultimately controlled by someone else.

Now comes the mind games.

>Compare that to the income stolen by government. It was never their property.

Actually no, its their money, it was always there money. Governments in effect own everything, and you only own things under the government. Its exactly how governments have operated since the dawn of time.

You're making the assumption that your definition of property is taken for granted, when its the subject of debate.

A government merely acts as a landlord in an anarch-capitalist state. They own everything. You are making the case they should not exist, but they exist right now.

>Your 'philosophy' will forever solely appeal to the ignorant and the losers.

The irony is biting. There has never been an anarcho-capitalist society, never will, and if there was, if it doesn't degenerate into either having a government, or be taken over in weeks, you will be lucky. The rest, from Social Democrats, Nationalists, even more traditional liberals, Socialists and yes, even left Anarchists have all had states and societies that where at least by some measures working. You are the loser. You will never accomplish anything except being a concern troll.

Right now, all over the world is ruled by governments. I don't see any winners in the anarch-capitalist camp.";1;1;False;GI_X_JACK;dlaf52r;Two biggest Bitcoin subs according to their counterparts (posted on both subs);6rjzu2;https://i.redd.it/hl4l7joqnpdz.png

A government is not a landlord. Its not defined by claiming property. What makes a government a government is its claim to be the only **legitimate** wielder of a monopoly on violence. That's it.

">Only if you claim no difference between the initiation of aggression and the use of force to defend against such.

I don't understand how that applies. I am only asking why government property claim is not legitimate, and a private claim is legitimate. I am also asking a theoretical diffrence. before populist republics, countries where merely the land possessions of kings and princes. Again, more private property.

>Let me guess, now you're going to ask me how squatting on ""my"" land constitutes an initiation of aggression...

No, I'm going to ask how you got your land, and how your property is defined, and what is the ultimate root to that property. You obviously bought it from someone, and who is the original property owner and how did they get it.

But now that you ask, is squatting an act of aggression that warrants violence? Are people who wander on your property subject to your laws you made up?

An innocent trespasser? No, that does not warrant violence.

But how about someone intent on Occupying my land? They're doing it for a variety of reasons, but one thing is clear: the will not leave the land I call mine unless physically removed.

There are a variety of ways I might respond to this, and I can't know which I'll employ unless actually faced with this situation.

"Fractional-reserve banking is not secret nor nefarious (in the sense that the people doing it know it's wrong), but it is destructive in two ways: 1. It inflates the ""money supply"" leading to higher prices (which wouldn't be as much of a problem w/out central-banking -- as there would be no corresponding base-money increase when the lending pyramid crashed), and 2. it distorts the ""capital structure"" by giving an overwhelming influence on capital allocation to banking institutions.";1;0;False;spendabit;dlaa7hx;Just a quick reminder why Bitcoin was invented in the first place.

I don't see it happening either that's my point. haha It would make more sense that each nation would try and ban it's use as a currency but last country standing (last to place a ban into affect) would maintain all of the financial power in the world, so why the fuck would they relinquish it all of a sudden once they had it? Fail. Each country rolls back on BTC Bans until they get 2nd and 3rd ... and so on places on the world economic financial podium of who has the most BTC (Digital Gold). There's no stopping BTC, not ever... Unless satoshi is Bruce Jenner or DOGE dog, or CIA or Mossad (or a combo of the aforementioned). There's no failure in sight, short or long term.

"It's also possible he prevented the second Great Depression. That's exactly what caused the first one: after the crash of 29, the Fed panicked and introduced austerity and fiscal tightening. Bernanke was a student of the Great Depression and he felt that they did the exact wrong thing, that they should have RELAXED fiscal policy. That's what he did. And he likely prevented a second one.

Of course the flood of liquidity created asset bubbles, which they will deflate quickly soon as they tighten rates (something that should, btw, be great for BTC). But most would consider that a fair trade off.

"Most of the money created by banks, and it is just ""created"" I agree at 10:1, is lent out for housing. The vast majority of it. Yes?

To get a loan for a house you have to use the house as collateral. Yes?

The house then goes on the bank's books. Yes?

EDIT: OK it appears you are talking cash and I am talking capital. Agree that as far as cash goes it is certainly created at or about 10:1.

However the implied negative of this is some sort of hyper inflation, which isn't happening because that created cash gets sunk into the created capital object, mostly new houses.
