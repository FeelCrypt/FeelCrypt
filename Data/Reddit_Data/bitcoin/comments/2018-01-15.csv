Hi i actually also applied 1 day before the submission, if its ok can you please send me the links, websites so i can refer it to Mr. Pine? I noticed that there are higher chances for some if its referred by the community. I know that he might reconsider, and he might do another batch. I am still one of the hopefuls but it's ok if i get turned down too. he chose wisely for everyone and he is the best! i wish a lot of people do these for the organizations. take care.;2;1;False;bluesupermoon;dsqcag4;"🍍 $4mil will fund MDMA trials for PTSD; marked 'Breakthrough Therapy' by FDA.

Detailed information about BTRIC is in our white paper which can be downloaded at https://go.btric.org/fostering-the-decentralization-revolution.

I wish you the best for your organization!  Mr. Pine has selected some really great groups that are changing the world and I know his contributions are going to help their missions immensely.

It's really good to see someone putting their Bitcoin wealth to serving a greater good.  It's this spirit that drove me to start our organization, so that we can focus on projects that will be making a difference in the world.

"there is clearly some details missing here.  like your rent was really paid to your parents to keep living at home for 200 a month.

you haven't been able to rent an apartment in NJ for under  800 dollars for almost 10 years. guy at my job last month told me he pays 500 dollars for a room in someone's house with no bathroom or anything.

how you can spend ~150 dollars a week on food and everything you need is insane. i can't see someone spending less then 50 dollars a week on food, 40 dollars a week to own a car, and 150 a week to rent an actual apartment in a smaller state. those costs alone would leave your savings down to 400-600 or so a month after taxes. and then assuming you have an apartment. i'm also assuming you had a phone bill, utilities bills, internet costs, so on and so forth.

What on earth has a stupid anecdotal story about your friends got to do with anything? I don't think you even understand the argument you condescendingly tried to respond to. If there is no demand for a particular commodity, and it has no inherent value, then it is inconsequential how limited the supply is. It doesn't matter if there are 50 available or 500,000, if there are no willing buyers, then it's worthless. In the case of Bitcoin, there obviously is sufficient demand at present, hence why the price is where it is, and so your example is completely irrelevant.;1;0;False;DrColossus22;dsppwgp;Hodling now feels like...;7qbeie;https://v.redd.it/bbwqz5fzq0a01

"I hear this argument from people like peter schiff who's terrified that BTC will actually become digital gold. There is inherent value in BTC in that it's NOT the US Dollar which is getting inflated to the tune of $20B a month. and currently it has a greater ease of use than gold or equal too if you consider things like goldmoney Schiffs project. But gold is always just a stay of value, it only rises relative to the inverse of inflation. meaning whatever you are comparing it to dollar wise is losing, aka the dollar is losing value. The difference with bitcoin is that not everyone in the world recognizes the value of BTC. 

Currently everyone in the world recognizes the value of gold. if someone were to offer you an ounce of gold for $1000 dollars and they had the proper information every one would take it (because they'd make $200 instantly). BTC however (at the time of this post is 13.5k) if you offered someone 1 BTC for $10,000 most of the world would tell you to fuck off.

To clarify more specifically gold is already priced at the market cap of the entire world economy (minus keynesian on debt, so realistically gold could potentially triple in value IF the entire world went back to a gold standard) BTC is measured at a $230B market cap, it's impossible to say exactly but the world market cap is somewhere in the 100T-1 Quadrillion range with all sorts of factors going into that.  what that means is if say the low end of 100T is the total market economy, well divide that by 230B and that IF the world adopted BTC as the world currency whatever you own now in BTC multiply it by 434, and that's what you can potentially be worth in a decade or so.";1;0;False;42autismyolo;dsp68f8;Hodling now feels like...;7qbeie;https://v.redd.it/bbwqz5fzq0a01

"Get used to sideways trading for a month or two until more lightning nodes are implemented and fees go down drastically. For the first time in human history, we have the advancement of something being an easy cheap currency and store of value. Until the currency portion is scaled properly, bitcoin’s full potential is not realized. 
Gold coins used to be that until they were over mined (we could find massive gold deposit in the deepest part of the ocean tomorrow increasing supply and reducing price) and than used as a store of wealth. Gold was rare and heavy (hard to steal) which is why they decided thousands of years ago to use it as currency. 
Bitcoin uses MATH and laws of the universe with precise calculations. It is not fully mined till 2140 so if we can get this payment solution solved finally, we will be set for hundreds of years just as when gold was readily Mineable. 

If bitcoin cannot solve this scaling problem soon where everyone can use it to buy things cheaply (commerce) than Governments will have an easier time banning it like in South Korea and China now. If the payment side of bitcoin was fixed and everyone could use it, no one would allow their governments to ban the way they pay for milk and eggs.

"**Metronome (public artwork)**

Metronome is a large public art installation located along the south end of Union Square in New York City. The work was commissioned by the Related Companies, developers of One Union Square South, with the participation of the Public Art Fund and the Municipal Art Society. The $4.2 million provided by the developer makes it one of the largest private commissions of public art.

The artwork was created by Kristin Jones and Andrew Ginzel and consists of several sections, including a round circular void from which puffs of white steam are released throughout the day, and a clock made of large orange LED digits.

"**Metronome (public artwork)**

Metronome is a large public art installation located along the south end of Union Square in New York City. The work was commissioned by the Related Companies, developers of One Union Square South, with the participation of the Public Art Fund and the Municipal Art Society. The $4.2 million provided by the developer makes it one of the largest private commissions of public art.

The artwork was created by Kristin Jones and Andrew Ginzel and consists of several sections, including a round circular void from which puffs of white steam are released throughout the day, and a clock made of large orange LED digits.

"**Metronome (public artwork)**

Metronome is a large public art installation located along the south end of Union Square in New York City. The work was commissioned by the Related Companies, developers of One Union Square South, with the participation of the Public Art Fund and the Municipal Art Society. The $4.2 million provided by the developer makes it one of the largest private commissions of public art.

The artwork was created by Kristin Jones and Andrew Ginzel and consists of several sections, including a round circular void from which puffs of white steam are released throughout the day, and a clock made of large orange LED digits.

"**National Debt Clock**

The National Debt Clock is a billboard-sized running total display which constantly updates to show the current United States gross national debt and each American family's share of the debt. It is currently installed on the western side of One Bryant Park, west of Sixth Avenue between 42nd and 43rd Streets in Manhattan, New York City. It was the first debt clock installed anywhere.

The idea for the clock came from New York real estate developer Seymour Durst, who wanted to highlight the rising national debt.

"Don't have a homepage, I'm afraid. Although I'm happy to provide schematics/layout/gerbers/source code/BOM to anyone who wants it. With the caveat that they're a monstrous pain in the butt to assemble, rely on obsolete Russian tubes from the 80's and certainly aren't attractive price wise.

">What psychological effect do you expect?

I see a number of potential benefits, from a marketing perspective.

The first 3 that come to mind are:

Brand awareness (A ***much*** more powerful thing than most realize)

FOMO, as previously mentioned

It highlights the fundamental differences between what the national debt # means, and it's implications on those (forced into) the USD system, and what the ""coins left to be mined""  means/implies for users.  This tends to have the effect of sparking varying levels of independent thought (and even independent research in some cases). 

This idea is damn good marketing, and since the ""product"" being pushed here is based in truth and justice, and is competing with deception and manipulation, I think it's damn good idea.
