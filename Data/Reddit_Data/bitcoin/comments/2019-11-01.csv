"> but the average US teacher salary is $60k/yr.

Yeah but does this factor in college professors (who had to get phd's, and had to spend far more on schooling)? I'm sure it does. 

> Yes, it varies greatly by school and state, but the bigger issues are that bad teachers are paid just the same as good ones

How do you quantify ""Good ones""? By test scores? By grades? Both of which can be easily (and have been) fabricated.

The solution is not quite as easy as you think it is.";0;1;False;banditcleaner2;f60gzxh;11 years ago today...;dph8ek;https://i.redd.it/p1udquwefsv31.png

"Again, every teacher I know isn't the one using that rhetoric. It's either bleeding hearts on a soapbox or a political device.

And again, my generalization isn't meant to single out the honest teachers who get fucked by the system.

Imo, teachers should get paid for teaching, possibly on a sliding scale even. There are standardized tests that could be used. My mother was a teacher for 40 years, retired twice, she lived for her students. Her 2nd grade students 40 years ago even have written an article in the newspaper within the past 7 years on her influence on them. A teacher that says I hope that makes sense, isn't a teacher. A teacher that says what if anything are you unsure about so I can help you, shouldn't get paid the same. I've got super strong feelings about this. Some teachers work for the summers, some work for the students. They shouldn't be paid the same. There should be a better way to determine and compensate the good ones.;1;0;False;idome1;f5z3u02;11 years ago today...;dph8ek;https://i.redd.it/p1udquwefsv31.png
