"> So if there's no backing, what is this ""assigned"" value?

It's backed by what people say it's worth. It has purchasing power and as long as people accept it, people will use it as a currency. It's kind of circulatory but it used to be back by gold; now it is debt and central banks regulating the printing of money.

Consumer spending, supply and demand for goods will affect the worth of currency. If people have less of it or a harder time obtaining it, businesses need to lower their prices to accommodate so people can purchase their goods/services, thus increasing the value of the currency.";1;1;False;darkfaith93;djj3i81;When I invested in BTC and it isn't giving me my expected 34524% returns;6jsaq4;https://i.redd.it/6hsumcajk66z.jpg

"Yeah, but at that point, can't we just do stock market finance using blockchains, too? I'm not saying fiat will disappear, but if you want value in real estate, stocks, bonds, etc. there may be ways we can finance that as well.

I think the big thing we're excited about with L2 networking is that we could use sidechains or altcoins backed by Bitcoin, even if they did have some small amount of inflation (say 1%), as long as you kept the ""bitcoin window"" open with an option to convert to BTC, you could easily replicate fiat money with a system whereby it was at least backed in the long term with holdings in Bitcoin. You could even tie it into gold holdings and offer someone an exchange rate of 1000 Zaeron coins to one BTC OR two ounces of gold, whichever they preferred, and change the basket of commodities on one end of the trade as you desired based on what people exchanged out of your currency for.

I realize none of this contradicts what you had to say, I'm just offering another way of looking at it. I guess maybe my point is that fiat is such a horrible way to save and has so many people at some many layers taking money out of it, that people are yearning for an alternative that doesn't take value away from them in ways they aren't prepared to have done.";1;0;False;Yorn2;djisdf2;When I invested in BTC and it isn't giving me my expected 34524% returns;6jsaq4;https://i.redd.it/6hsumcajk66z.jpg

"There is currently no hard limit on coins with respect to Ethereum, and QE is as ""easy"" as a hardfork away for most crypto coins, Bitcoin included. Not to mention any new ICO could implement QE within its coin-a-sphere from the ground up if they chose too.

"> QE is a method of managing those swings. Bitcoin by design has no method of managing those swings.

The problem -- and when we really get down to it, we all know it's the thing that is driving cryptos now -- is that QE creates an environment where savers cannot reliably save in fiat so having fiat is a liability. Your bank makes money off of you charging higher and higher fees, not the other way around. The credit card companies use you to make money off the merchants. Everyone at every level of fiat finance has a hand in your pocket.

There are no good risk-reward investments in the fiat world, nothing that will make people money consistently compared to the past when 4-5% on savings accounts were considered ""the norm"", bond markets could easily hit 8% and munis were often over 10%? You can throw your money in SPY or a Vanguard fund and hope that when you retire it isn't during the biggest crash, but most of us have retirement funds from our day jobs already invested in that sort of stuff.

Aren't the swings in value against other currencies though? In a world where **bitcoin** is our currency then milk, rent and so on would stay far more static, if it changed at all.

The world you describe is a world where *both* bitcoin and a local currency are our currency; milk and rent is still actually paid in local currency; milk and rent are pegged at the local currency, not bitcoin.

I.e. the $AUD has fluctuated against the $USD over the past 15 years from around 0.5 to around 1.1. The prices of milk and rent in Australia had no practically no relationship to this at all. Negligible.

"The thing is I'm not very wrong. 
My comments have nothing to do with the past.  

My point is, you're comparing figures now that have a massive correlation to the way the global economy works.

$1 to $3,000 is nothing considering the total market cap at $3,000 is feasible. 

Now, some noob entering Bitcoin hoping to see the same gain, is simply ignoring the global economy and its limits. Bitcoin went from $1 at a point to $3,000 - meaning 3,000 times its value! Let's say someone is hoping for even half of that - 1,500. That would mean the current $2,500 would become $3.75 million per 1 btc.  

Let's use Van-Petersen's aggressive, highly optimistic figures and analysis needed for 1 btc to becoming $100k (40 times the current price). ""...Van-Petersen is assuming cryptocurrencies in general – not just bitcoin – will account for 10 percent of the average daily volumes (ADV) of fiat currency trade in 10 years. Foreign exchange ADV currently stands at just over $5 trillion, according to the Bank for International Settlements.
Ten percent of $5 trillion is $500 billion. This is the ADV that cryptocurrencies could have. Bitcoin will account for 35 percent of that market share, which would that $175 billion of the $500 billion figure, he said. This would mean that $175 billion worth of bitcoin would be traded every day. Also, Van-Petersen then implies that bitcoin's market capitalization would be ten times the average daily volume, giving a figure of $1.75 trillion for the market cap. The current figure is around $37.8 billion, according to data from industry website CoinDesk.
Bitcoin has a limited supply of 21 million which is expected to be reached by the year 2140. In 10 years, the analyst thinks that there will be 17 million bitcoin in circulation, up from the current 16.3 million figure.
If the potential 17 million of bitcoins in supply is divided by the $1.75 trillion market cap estimate, then each bitcoin would be worth just over $100,000.""

That's a scenario that requires A LOT to occur on a global scale, VAST public acceptance of Bitcoin, expansive integration in major retailers accepting and advertising and a HUGE amount of the general public willing to trade their fiat for Bitcoin. Meaning you need average joe auto mechanic to even be on board with obtaining btc. 

People don't stop and realize the total financial market on a global scale and what's required of it for Bitcoin to have a value of even $25k/btc. Going from $1/btc to $3,000/btc (3,000x) is actually easier than $2,500/btc going up merely 10x. 

If you got into btc with anything less than $100,000 and anything higher than $1,000/btc, you're not going to have anywhere near $1 million in Bitcoin, sorry.

"Which is all true. 
$12k is feasible. 
The problem is, probably 90% of the btc community that got to the party after 2016, is thinking they're going to have success story when Bitcoin becomes worth $200,000. 

The global currency requirements for $100k/btc to happen aren't going to happen. The people who have new money flooding into crypto don't realize that 3,000x gain from $1 to $3,000 is actually insanely easier than $3,000 just going up 10x. People can't stomach the 'late to the party' aspect of Bitcoin and think their $800 is going to buy them a $300,000 car in 5-10 years.

The long term play is that bitcoin becomes more widely adopted and ingrains itself into the global economy.  There is no way to determine the price or a projection. Trying to project something like this complete guess work. You could be right, in 5 years it could be worth 5k a coin. It could also be worth 12k by the end of the following year and 6k the year after that. Its unknown, and thats the point. The upside to something like this is clearly large. After 6-7 years it has only grown despite its ups and downs. Believers in the technology are willing to risk money and time for the chance that this or another cryptocurrency becomes an essential part of our monetary system.;1;1;False;Jsweezy1212;djhs8mc;When I invested in BTC and it isn't giving me my expected 34524% returns;6jsaq4;https://i.redd.it/6hsumcajk66z.jpg
