As in, they don't think they're doing anything wrong, and in fact believe they are doing what is best for the country, and an audit might uncover things that would LOOK bad even though they're good for us, because people will misconstrue it in their ignorance.

Like the CIA keeps their activities classified because they do bad things but always for the 'greater good.'

"Because one of the chief requirements for effectiveness of monetary policy is the speed and timing that it gets put out, and the ""audit the fed"" bill which requires fucking CONGRESS THE SLOWEST BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT KNOWN TO MAN, to approve or disapprove policy that comes out is stupid. Not to mention Congress is not educated on economics in the way that everyone at the CBO or The Fed is and widely dont understand the causes and effects of policy.

For example the reason the housing crash in 2008 was not worse than the great depression was how fast the fed could push out its policy. The policy itself was very unconventional and would probably have taken congress fucking months and months to decide on, and those months would have caused the situation to get so much worse than it was.

Similarly in the 80s the was a controversial policy that caused Demand to decrease heavily (a raising of interest rates) congress never would have approved this. However this policy helped to stop the rapidly increasing inflation that was going on (over 10% consistently the last few years) because it caused a very short recession, however for the greater good of stabilizing inflation which, if left unchecked, would have had MUCH worse consequences.";38;2;False;Starlorb;dk4uhjq;Guy just did this on live tv;6mut9d;https://i.redd.it/nsokakmrn69z.jpg
"I don't know if ""Audit the Fed"" is a good or bad movement, but the name is disingenuous.

**The FED is audited** in the normal sense of the term.  The books and assets are regularly examined and reviewed by independent companies and the Government Accountability Office (GAO).

What the GAO cannot examine are the regular meeting minutes and reasoning for policy decisions and member to member communications. Things like that.

The ""Audit the Fed"" will remove these GAO limitations. The concern is that with having very detailed communications and meeting discussions, etc, the FED can (and will) face political pressure, and the political pressure will affect the FED's decisions.

That is, the FED is concerned that this will open them up to government micromanagement.

"Dude don't be ridiculous. It's a hundred times more complicated than setting up a PayPal account and you know it. 

For PayPal you just fill out a simple form with data from a check using an existing bank account that you already have and understand completely, and they have pictures and diagrams to help you do that much. There's no research required and it doesn't involve any new vocabulary or concepts.

Bitcoin is more like setting up a new bank account with a completely foreign currency and a ton of words you've never seen before, and first understanding the concept of bitcoin as a whole, that you host the account on your own hardware instead of any institution, and that you have to download the whole blockchain in the process (and what the blockchain even is). Then you have to shop around and research a dozen exchanges, understand the concept of buying a tiny fraction of a ""single coin"" and the dynamic exchange rate, figuring out where (if anywhere) you can even spend it for things you'd otherwise buy with cash, and possibly learning about the tax implications.

It's a completely bizarre system to everyone the first time they hear about it and it requires a non-trivial investment to learn about it, and significantly more than that to understand how to go about using it.

Let's not pretend any sizable portion of any modern population is interested in going through all that effort. People are lazy and these days feel like they have enough to worry about. 

Some kind of global cryptocurrency is probably going to take over eventually. But it ain't gonna be this in its current form. Unless some crazy politician somewhere decides to mandate teaching about it in schools.

"You don't know what you're talking about. The way that the semiconductor industry works doesn't allow people to just jump in. You're talking about building a new fabrication plant. Making one that's competitive would take over a decade and tens of billions of dollars. It's not reasonable. There's a limited capacity, especially these days with smartphones everywhere. Capitalism isn't some perfect system that can make anything work out in the end. All that can happen is one of three things:

1.) Customers spend more by going with the high-end

2.) Customers go with a substitute product, such a console or laptop

3.) Customers just give up on gaming altogether

That's it. Oh, and since you're probably confused, AMD and Nvidia design GPUs. They don't manufacture them. Fabrication plants handle that. So, to increase capacity there would need to be a new plant... and then AMD and Nvidia would have to invest R&D to get the GPUs working on their nodes... and nodes take years to develop even when they're not made from scratch... You have to be woefully ignorant to think, ""oh, there will just be a new competitor because capitalism."" My economics professors would laugh in your face for thinking it's really that simple.
