>2015 - Kentucky Riots - 31 Rioting Fans Arrested after Kentucky loss in Final Four. Large disturbances and many fires set.

The bar is pretty low to get on this list, hell a good portion of them are sports related.  We protect the rights of people to assemble, and when mob mentality gets out of hand they get arrested.  Please don't claim this as evidence of a coming civil war, almost all of them have nothing to do with any other event on this list.

All the more reason to talk about these things when people are insisting not to. I'm not the sort of person who believes things without proof.

It might be more peaceful than it was in the end of 80's, but not more peaceful than 10 years ago. I do recognize that thinking about worst case scenarios can worsen my outlook on life, but on the other hand people don't seem to react accordingly to events that need reacting. This leads to the situations getting slowly so bad that by the time people find their lives intolerable the result is violence. I would really like for things to resolve early on so that they can be resolved without violence and suffering. That's why I might sound a bit pessimistic. If people are suffering from mania isn't it ethical to bring them down to earth before they hurt themselves?;1;0;False;SebastianMaki;csiginl;Silk Road operator Ross Ulbricht to sentenced life in prison;37rfjz;http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/may/29/silk-road-ross-ulbricht-sentenced

"Since the post hit the front page, here is some context about bitcoin for the general public:



> Bitcoin is a *World Wide Ledger* (see: [Blockchain technology](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Block_chain)) backed by mathematics, open source code, cryptography and the most powerful and secure decentralized distributed computational network on the planet, orders of magnitude more powerful than google and government combined. There is a limit of 21 million bitcoins (divisible in smaller units). Dollars are not backed by gold anymore since long time ago, they are printed by the trillions out of nothing by the private institution called ""Federal"" Reserve.
> 
> **Receive and transfer money, from cents (micropayments) to thousands:**
> 
> * Almost for free (a few cents fee).
>  
> * Privacy (no need to expose personal information)
> 
> * Securely (encrypted cryptographically)
>  
> * Instantly (from seconds to a few minutes)
>  
> * Open source (auditable by anybody)
> 
> * Worldwide (from anywhere to anywhere on the planet)
>  
> * Peer-to-peer (no intermediaries with a cut)
>  
> * Public ledger (transparent, seen by everybody)
>  
> * Decentralized (distributed with no single point of failure)
> 
> * No chargebacks-No fraud ('push' vs' 'pull' transactions).﻿
