You know this is true.

When a baker shoots up all the other bakeries and forces you to work several months of the year for free in exchange for shit tier bread, that's called organized crime.

Treasury borrows money from the Fed to print money, which the Treasury uses to fund the government. Then the Treasury collects taxes to pay back the Fed. 

The congress appointed board of the Fed determines how much money the government can borrow at what interest rates. They choose rates based on maximizing certain objectives like inflation target.

"Inflation and deflation are the market's way of regulating when it is better to save or consume. The problem is that we are so used to states artificially controlling that through interest rates and other central banking policies that we don't really have any models to make predictions about a completely free market for mediums of exchange.

This is a completely new and groundbreaking area of economics.
We will wonder how cryptocurrency will contend with all of the known issues with finance, monetary policy, and economics, without any clue how crypto will resolve those issues, only to realize that they issues don't apply to an open-source, decentralized, pseudonymous technology that proves to be very durable against attempted state influence.

People need to consider that the very fact that we don't know what cards are in this deck make it worth fleshing out the implications to their entirety just to see where the chips fall.

My bet is it will be a paradigm change on the scale of the industrial revolution or the internet. It will mark the point where future society will point back to Satoshi's whitepaper and appreciate that as the turning point responsible for what their current reality entails.

EDIT: Thought of a good analogy after I posted this and thought it was worth the edit.
Just as Galileo's major insight was that falling bodies must uniformly and universally accelerate towards each other, but the thing fucking up everyone's intuition about that was the fact that we were trapped in atmosphere which had an influence over resisting bodies of different densities. It took over 300 years to build a vacuum to prove he was right. The major insight from cryptocurrency will be how an economy works without the state having a practical monopoly on the medium of exchange. Once people can see the practicality of cryptocurrencies with the state sequestered from influencing it in any meaningful way, people will quickly see the obvious value in removing the state from such controls over the money supply.
People will suffer as *heretics* at the hands of the current system, but ultimately it will win out.";5;1;False;eitauisunity;dq9yutw;This is governments trying to regulate bitcoin.;7f4tbb;https://i.imgur.com/xmVLuaP.gifv

"Which is exactly what the state forces on the economy when they keep interest rates artificially low and let inflation get out of hand. The reason why this is done is due to a conflict of interest.

The state needs you to spend money because taxes tend only to be collected when money changes hands.
If you earn money, it gets taxed, and then it just sits under your mattress or in you bank account, the state's bottom line is affected. The fact that you aren't spending that money to be received by someone else, and then taxed by the state, they make no money on you just letting your money sit around.
Historically, the signal to save is high interest rates. By saving, you are reaping the benefits of a promise for having greater capital in the future. It is worth it to save because your returns will be worth the wait to spend the money.
However, if society has too much socked away, then deflation becomes an issue because the availability of currency becomes lower with respect to demand, which is then signaled by a decrease in interest rates, which is the market's way of saying ""Okay, we don't *need* any more money to lend, so we aren't going to pay as high of a premium on it.""

This shifts the consumers incentives from saving to spending and investing.
The incentive to just have the money sitting around if it isn't working for your future becomes less appealing. Once enough spending/investing have occurred, less money is going in to savings, and the market will signal this by raising interest rates again. This all happens as a result of individuals pursuing their own self-interest in optimizing the value of what they have earned. 

When a central authority such as the federal reserve come along and start dicking with the market's signal for savings/spending, it creates an incentive where consumers are acting counter to their own incentives. This is the fundamental problem of state-controlled fiat. The people leveraging labor as their primary means of capital are robbed of the incentive to save, because the state has made it not worth it for them by encouraging more transactions (and therefore more opportunities to collect taxes). By keeping interest rates this artificially low, it is signaling to the market ""Don't bother saving, it will just become less and less valuable over time due to inflation (that we also create) so you may as well get out there and spend your money so you see the maximum value."" This is destroying our economy and our society, but it's all for a quick buck for a massive empire that can is struggling keeping up with their debts. Enter cryptocurrency: a meaningful way for the average person to check out of the ponzie scheme. The implications of this will echo through generations to come. It will mark a true change in the potential that humanity can achieve when each individual has a meaningful right to protect the results of their productivity. Yes, it's turbulent right now, but if or when it makes it through that, it will be something we have never seen as a species before.";15;2;False;eitauisunity;dq9zm5r;This is governments trying to regulate bitcoin.;7f4tbb;https://i.imgur.com/xmVLuaP.gifv

Yes there are many ways to catch someone. But that doesn’t mean you just ignore and scrap protections in place that help. You get rid of gun laws because hey they can get an illegal gun anyway so why have the laws? Scrap the process of fingerprinting because surely you’ll find DNA instead... it doesn’t work like that. You have laws about seat belts and laws about speed limits and laws about drink driving, they all aim to prevent crashes. You don’t scrap some because the others might catch the problem.

It’s not about priorities, it’s about having a way to back track to the source of an issue when something bad is uncovered. Whether that’s someone supplying drugs or Russia buying political ads during the election, or identifying someone who is avoiding paying taxes.. Money needs to be traceable. Yes people find ways around it with offshore bank accounts, and the governments try to crack down on it. But they’re never going to allow a new currency that thrives on anonymity.

Not sure why you bring up whistleblowers and activists? That’s got nothing to do with the currency they’re using.

Government exists as a representation of the people. All people. Yes in America your government is probably the worst example of a democratic government in the western world due to lobbying and campaign donations causing your government to protect the interests of their donors (which is why you don’t have single payer health care, decent gun control and why your new tax bill will hurt the little guy).

"Its incredibly simple but you can't admit it once you drink the crypto koolaid. 

Governments control money because we want them too. Because before they did money was controlled by private entities who produced it. Those entities manipulated currency at the expense of the market for private gain. To curb this governments took control. This went as far as some countries completely abandoning gold as a primary currency in favour of notched sticks or giant stone donuts. 

The current form of currency we have has evolved over time to encourage stability and fairness. 

Crypto nuts hate centralized curency that is regulated and manipulated by the government and prefer a completely wild currency with no regulation to it what so ever. Aka a volatile currency. 

Its using digital technology to roll currency back 90 years and make it global. Its value is almost entirely speculative and its structure limits its ability to speak to market trends. 

In almost any metric that we evaluate currency, its just inferior and out dated. 

You need a regulatory power of some sort. It can't be automated unless you can perfectly predict markets until the end of time. That regulatory power needs to be accountable.

And then it's really not cool if you're in debt because your debt is growing in value.

"It's ironic though. 

Back in the day, people loved bitcoin (and cryptos) because they could buy stuff WITH bitcoins. No middle-man involved, and gov. intervention in form of sales taxes, money trails, etc. 

Today, people love bitcoins because it's worth a lot of in other fiat currencies. BUT they get pissed off about tax rates and whatnot, when they want to exchange their bitcoins into other fiat (USD, EUR, etc.). 

Also, government regulation doesn't always mean ""we just want our cut"", it's also to provide safety-measurements. 

Imagine if there were no financial regulations, and any bank could just pocket your money and make a run for it. With no regulations, the gov. would just tell you:  

""Well that sucks man, but what can we do? It's your responsibility to pick the right bank, and know the people you're dealing with. Better luck next time!"" 

Luckily, this isn't the case, and your money is insured (to a certain limit) if the bank goes bust, or they decide to just steal your money.

"I believe that they will try to pump and dump to bring it down. Remember that bitcoin only makes up half of 1% of the total investments in the world. When it crosses to 2 - 5%, then it will become a problem. Personally, I believe that if people do it legitimately and extract their money through coin base for example and actually pay their taxes, they won’t have a problem with it. Also you have to remember that most countries are embracing bitcoin, not the other way around. And we all know a global currency is coming. My opinion is that bit coin will not emerge as the victor. The big banks have enough money to destroy ANY market, and eventually they will if it continues, as is. Who controls the government? The banks. They will not let anyone stand in their way that threatens to undermine their system. But I still think that is a few years off. Crypto markets are exploding, yes, but they make up a tiny portion of total global investments, but that is changing fast. Gold makes up 7% of the global investments. Crypto makes up 0.5% right now. I would watch the market cap number, once it starts to dethrone gold, then I would be concerned.
For the record, the government is a threat, but the banks are a bigger threat. I am more concerned of the latter. I also want to point out that every time they crack down on something, a black market emerges. I believe that crypto currency will thrive in a black market regardless of what they do.

I'm sorry, what? Other parts of the world have advanced much faster in fiber technology, which is a wired technology, than us. Granted, we're a big country, but there is A LOT more competition in most of Europe and many Asian countries, and as a result prices are quite a bit lower. The secret to competition is to make the last mile to the customer's home free for all, i.e. to force providers to let other ISPs use that last mile.

"No one is coming with guns, it's a too simplistic analogy. People with 0 revenue almost don't pay anything and I'm glad that I have good public services. Almost everybody is contributing, we're a big community of more than a hundred million of people, it's logistically impossible to ask Bob if we could take a little bit of his revenue and convince him. Bob will have his say when he will go vote (and that include the local authorities who also have local taxes).  
You'd pay far more if all the public services were private as everyone would have to pay non-proportionally to their revenues, also battling against potential monopoly that aren't subject to competition (yes it's possible in a free market). In Norway if you're rich and have to pay a ticket for drunk driving, it will actually be calculated proportionally to your revenue : this is fair.  
To me, property isn't a ""natural"" right. Your property is first guaranteed to be enforced by the state itself, but your property is also *potentially* denying other people access to a certain area of the world, hence the payment to keep it.

"20k in any 1 type (receiving/sending), the aggregate over a year. Not just 20k in a single transaction. Probably won’t apply to many people though. 

Also note even  if the IRS doesn’t go after people, it is the law. 

Ex. virtually no one reports online purchases to get taxed more locally, but that is the law. Probably not a big deal unless you bought thousands and thousands of stuff every year without being taxed. 

Point being if you’re up there in the 10k range every year might want to pony up. If it’s long term gains it’s not likely to be that significant a bill, and while the IRS is pretty rough with people that didn’t pay their taxes when they catch them (if it appears intentional/significant) if you come to them they’re apparently very flexible and accommodating.

I wouldn’t worry unless I was in the 10k range though, up to you though.

It's not the currency, it's the implementation of it. If Steam accepted Bitcoin directly or used a payment processor that didn't charge their own fees, it wouldn't be so bad.

"> Because spending outrageous amounts to transactions is literally wasting money compared to just using fiat, as of right now

You're talking about fees?  I don't spend outrageous amounts on fees, so that doesn't seem particularly relevant to me.

> Also spending currency that has a steady uptrend is much worse than spending currency with a steady downtrend

I re-buy what I spend as a general rule.  But overall, it sounds like you're arguing that deflationary currencies ""only get hoarded and never spent"".  I think this is a very shortsighted view.  I wrote the following a while ago to someone else saying the same thing:

---

> Inflationary currencies encourage spending by making your money worth less over time. This is true. Deflationary currencies encourage saving by making your money worth more over time. This is also true.

> However, this assumes that spending ""for the sake of it"" is good, which is an assumption that doesn't have a lot of evidence behind it. I will always need to spend money. Whether it be for necessities like food and shelter, or just to give myself a better life.

> Consider this: Many goods are ""more deflationary"" than the fiat currency you use in daily life. For example, a brand new computer/car/fridge/etc will lose value over time much faster than a pile of US dollars (at least at current and expected rates). So why do people buy a new thing now instead of an older 'deflated value' one later? Obviously it's because they value the utility of the computer/car/fridge/etc now more than the utility value lost by waiting until it is cheaper.

> So, would a ""world bitcoin economy"" reduce spending? Yes. But I'd argue the spending it reduces is only the spending which was above and beyond what people should be spending anyway (it's clear this exists by the amount of private debt in most modern first world countries). Spending will continue, but be reduced to those things that people either need or want enough that the value to them having it now is greater than the loss of future savings value increases.

> It's also worth pointing out that the ""massive"" increases in value we've seen in bitcoin won't be sustained forever. The greater the number of users, the lower the volatility. If it reaches the point of being a ""common currency"" around the world (let alone a sole currency), it will likely be very stable in general and the deflation will be quite predictable (perhaps similar to the inverse of current inflation rates, but there's no way to easily predict that).

"The whole altcoins war and Bitcoin Cash vs. Bitcoin drama is about the question if we should have bigger blocks.

Satoshi the creator of Bitcoin seems to not have expected this problem either 

>It can be phased in, like:
If (blocknumber > 115000) maxblocksize = largerlimit
It can start being in versions way ahead, so by the time it reaches that block number and goes into effect, the older versions that don't have it are already obsolete.
When we're near the cutoff block number, I can put an alert to old versions to make sure they know they have to upgrade.

This was his only comment on the issue back when they **randomly** decided to implement a Block size limit.

"Seriously, you're spreading FUD.  Either you realise it and are doing it on purpose to shill for something else, or you don't realise it because you honestly believe the fees are required to be that high.

At every point in time that I've wanted to use BTC (which is quite a lot - I actually use it as a currency regularly), I've paid fees under the equivalent of €2.  Most of the time, it's been under €1.

My most recent Steam purchase was Civilization VI, which (I just checked) is priced at €30.  The last time I spent BTC at a café, my bill was somewhere around €40 (two people, coffee, beer, snack, and ice-cream).  Fees of under €2 on purchases of that size are WELL within the level that I consider to be acceptable.

Would I like to be able to make smaller purchases with bitcoin?  Absolutely.  However not at the expense of network security and decentralisation, which is why I'm happy to wait for proper solutions to allow these use cases (e.g. Lightning).

Now, you might argue that fees are significantly higher and point to your wallet's estimation.  That is a problem of your wallet, NOT a problem of bitcoin itself.  Get a wallet that lets you set your own fees.

You might argue that spam transactions filling up the mempool mean its so full that your transaction will never get processed.  That's a common myth and quite simply a terrible misunderstanding about fees.  The total number of transactions in the mempool is **completely irrelevant** to what fee you should pay.  The only relevant factor is how many transactions there are of a fee higher than you want to pay.  That is, if there are millions of transactions with fees at 5sat/B (likely spam), but the number of transactions with fees of over 10sat/B are quite low, then you absolutely WILL get your transaction processed quickly paying only 10sat/B.  It's additionally worth noting that ""quick"" transactions also aren't always required.  If it looks like 10sat/B will take a few hours but 20sat/B will clear fast, you should only pay 20sat/B if you NEED it to clear.  Paying 10sat/B is going to be absolutely fine if the time that it get included in a block doesn't matter as much to you.";1;1;False;dalebewan;dq9vjrf;I was trying to buy a game on Steam, had no idea they accepted Bitcoin as a form of payment.

"Everytime a ledger of transactions has to be verified they are combined with the previous cryptographic hash, the essence of bitcoin is that the miners have to guess what the next hash with be. This is an energy intensive process that becomes exponentially more energy intensive as more transactions are added to the ledger.

People have tried to modify the BTC equation to make the process more streamlined and less costly for the consumer. Usually these efforts boil down to a hard fork that doesn’t stick. It does undermine what value bitcoin has as a result of mass adoption.
