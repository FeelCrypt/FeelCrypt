No it is not.  By your definition all stock price acquisitions are speculation. 

Investment is understanding the market, and positioning accordingly.   Speculation is simply seeing a trend, and buying into that trend.  I am not a speculator.

"> Do you think both people and governments will embrace bitcoin, and does it matter? 

I think it is unavoidable.  I also don't think it is going to be resisted quite as much as people think it will be.  People still need to pay their taxes, and that is not going to stop.  The main thing it is going to do is prick the bubble of consumer debt, and remove the banking middle-men from that space.  That alone is a multi-trillion dollar industry, let alone the annuities that banks own and graft from, from those assets.  Removing these people (i.e. banking debt suppliers) from positions of power, by strangling their access to capital, is a justification for bitcoin in its own right.  Imagine a world in which banks didn't control governments.  

Said [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7adetn/consumers_are_wrongly_perceiving_bitcoin_as_a/dp9cwby/), mostly I think bitcoin will finally separate the good debt from the bad debt. It is my personal belief ( as in i don't know of any formal theory ) that debt should only be incurred for the use of building a productive asset. In a deflationary currency, this encourages businesses to ensure that productivity increases will have greater returns than savings. Instead, our financial system has encouraged the acquisition of debt for fixed assets. The only thing this has done is bid up the price of those fixed debts with debt, and handed over the money for supporting that system to banks and their owners. In order to stimulate growth in such a system, the only way that you can function is to tax savings. That's what inflation is.  What it forces people to do is to invest in increasingly risky assets, because of the loss of their purchasing power.  Hence bubble after bubble after bubble.  Crisis after crisis after crisis.

Bitcoin will eventually stabilize to an ever appreciating value asset. But what it will allow you to do is save for a house. If you have a business proposal that encourages people to pay you for a good or service, people will invest their savings in it and take on that risk.  Banks will instead move back to providing capital to businesses, using savings from people that are willing to invest.  Businesses will again focus on productivity increases, because that's how you get access to capital.

That's the way it is supposed to work i think.  Like I said, it is pure genius.";1;1;False;Frogolocalypse;dpd61ko;Lily Allen turned down 200K in Bitcoins for a gig in 2009 which is worth $1,426,199,000 as of this writing;7aq0fx;https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/lily-allen-calls-herself-an-idiot-for-declining-bitcoin-payment-now-worth-millions-9046211.html

"Nothing, nothing at all.  Also anyone at this point talking about why a crypto currency is a good investment is just to get more people to buy in.

Now you're just changing the goalposts because you were wrong.  Seriously, I'm don't think I'm going to bother replying to this thread after this one unless you can start making some coherent points.

> Bitcoin has no more fundamental value than any other cryptocurrency that is based on exactly the same technology.

Yes it does.  It has the most accumulated proof of work and the largest/most distributed network.  These are the fundamental aspects that make it valuable.  You can copy bitcoin and start the exact same technology from scratch and it will be worthless beside bitcoin because of this.  Don't assume that all of the value of a piece of software comes from its code and is therefore easily replicable.

> bitcoin being deflationary guarantees it will never become adopted as a mainstream currency. No one ever wants to spend deflationary currencies because they keep increasing in value.

This is such an idiotic argument that is spouted far too often, even by those who should know better.  I spend bitcoin often and other people would as well.  Why? Because I want stuff.  I need food in my belly and a roof over my head.  I want a nice car.  I want to go on interesting holidays with my wife and children.  Basically, I want to live my life.  Doing this takes money.  So yes, I could save it up longer and watch the value grow, but then I'll die rich and unhappy, having never done anything with my money.

Inflationary currencies are said to encourage spending, but what they really do is encourage *wasting* money on things that people don't really want/need because their money won't buy as much tomorrow as it does today.  Deflationary systems do indeed discourage spending, but it's not going to stop people buying the things they need and indeed the things they *really* want.";0;1;False;dalebewan;dpe4q7w;Lily Allen turned down 200K in Bitcoins for a gig in 2009 which is worth $1,426,199,000 as of this writing;7aq0fx;https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/lily-allen-calls-herself-an-idiot-for-declining-bitcoin-payment-now-worth-millions-9046211.html

">In that sense, it's a better investment.

It's potentially more profitable, but its also potentially more ruinous. That makes it a better gamble, not an investment. It's just a different kind of investment. There is no way to get extremely high returns without high risk. If you want to invest money you need to diversify between high risk and return and low risk and return. If you want to gamble then keeping everything in high risk assets like bitcoin.

Bitcoin has sextupled in the last 6 months which is obviously not a sustainable rate of growth.

> A change will have to be made eventually (IMO removing the 21 million cap and just having a small block reward pay out indefinitely to make up for lost coins and increasing population), before it's useable as currency (or usable as more than a novelty as it is now).

Bitcoin miners are going to have no incentive to vote this through though, even though its whats best for use as a currency. They didn't invest millions in mining equipment with dreams of making a small steady income off transaction fees.

They got in because early adoption offered huge rewards in an artificially scarce asset undergoing a speculative bubble. Transaction fees are a tiny percentage of what they have made from rapid appreciation of bitcoins.

There will be a strong incentive to switch to new up and coming coins that are offering the same early-adopter rewards that bitcoin did.

It's one of the problems with Bitcoins ""decentralization"". It's still heavily reliant on a small group of people who have a huge amount of influence over the currency. Bitcoin can't work without centralized computer power, so they're held captive by the miners to a great extent.

"I know that the basis of stocks is the dividend payment because if they weren’t, they would be worthless. Stocks that don’t pay dividends like Facebook, Amazon, or Tesla are more speculative in nature, but they have value primarily because people believe they will one day pay dividends.

"> im not trying to be a ""counter argument guy"" im just weary of investing any money into something that is risky.

Its the same thing happening all over again. See a bunch of computer software execs laugh in unison over the idea of some peripheral called a ""mouse"". But in a lot of ways I can take your points and use them against electric cars, solar panels. 

It even makes sense to have push back against the automobile vs horses.

> where as if i had a million USD i could use that anywhere on the planet, reasonably.

How many places have you been? The second you leave America you wont be using USD very much. You will end up usually having to go through exchanges for local currency. At that bitcoin is probably slightly BETTER as you wont have to deal with any bullshit if you do manage to find places that accept it.

On that same note, its really not that hard to convert BTC to USD. Coinbase has made it almost too easy. I have been enjoying it quite a bit over the last few months. I use a blogging page called Steemit to talk about a game I am working on and the page rewords a crupto currency that is easily exchanged for BTC. I predict that in a few years you will begin earning some kind of crypto currency simply for doing things on the internet. A web browser called Brave apparently allows people to tip you.

Its entirely possible one day your kharma on reddit will be converted to BTC. At that point if you decide to not take the ""free money"" that's your problem.

I don't even see the issue with exchanging it really. Once you get used to it you don't even really have to think about it.

Your strongest counter arguments to crypto currency is government crackdown and the other is Quantum computing.

Government crackdown would have to be VERY extensive to be possible and would likely be about as successful as the war on drugs. The coins would become MORE popular probably...

Quantum computing my very well make all password protection completely worthless. In light of that it may be able to completely take apart the block chain. But in that case it will have already just ravaged everything else in the process. Your fiat currency located in your bank account is more ill prepared again Quantum computers.

So you don't care about buying crypto much today, thats completely understandable. Your going to end up using it eventually anyway. Most alt media already uses the blockchain and bitcoin tipping will slowly become the norm.

Look at the volume of trades occurring and you’ll see it hasn’t increased which you need it to because it’s an accurate measure of market potential.

"I know what you mean.  I just don't subscribe to the same belief.  Investment requires an understanding of the asset you are acquiring, whether that is for dividends, or as a venture capitalist to invest in the seed round of a start-up so that you can sell your stock in the product for an increased price at some later date, or an asset you acquiring because you expect it to increase in value at a later date for justifiable reasons.  

Just so you know, this isn't my particular bent.  This is what I've gotten [from Warren Buffet](https://theweek.com/articles/459166/how-warren-buffett-made-10-billion-during-financial-crisis).  When he invested in banks during the 2007 financial crisis, it wasn't because he was expecting dividends.  He was expecting to buy low and sell high.

"Oh, dear.

1) There are ~99 actual bitcoins ""known to be Satoshi's"" and 50 of them are unspendable. We can guess (and we would almost certainly be correct if we did) that a whole lot more coins are controlled by Satoshi (most of the earliest-mined coinbases), but we do not even come *close* to ""knowing"" which coins are Satoshi's and which are not, *even* for those earliest blocks. ""Know"" is simply too strong a word, period.

2) [As I've said before](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/799k3u/comment/dp18djz), though some nonce-based analysis concluded that roughly 1 million of the earliest mined coins were mined by a single entity (assumed to be Satoshi), this analysis was based on a string of questionable assumptions and is not really something you want to be basing statements like ""we know X"" upon.

3) (and this was my crucial point, which unfortunately appears to have escaped you): *even* assuming the aforementioned analysis *did* arrive at a correct conclusion, *it only establishes a lower bound, at best*. Satoshi could have been mining plenty of blocks and coins that *aren't* identifiable in any way whatsoever, and in fact, it is almost a certainty that he/she/they/it did. All you would have to do if you were Satoshi is spend the coins that you mined most recently (in 2011 or 2012, most likely) first, rather than doing something insane like spending the coins from blocks #2-10, and you would be lost in the crowd of early adopters and slip under the radar with ease.

"Yeah I don't disagree with you on most of this. Only two remarks:

As for better investment it just depends what you're after.

If you're the kind of person who goes for for the latter than cyrpto currencies are absolutely ""good"" for you.

That's actually what I mean. I don't think fees are a sustainable way to incentivize mining and we'd all prefer Bitcoin to just have low or zero fees. That's one of its main original value propositions which appeals to the average user on a daily basis. Instead, the value proposition that it has a hard limit is not helpful to its adoption or utility or network sustainability and mostly just serves to give libertarians a hard on. My proposal would be to continue giving block rewards forever, even if just 1 BTC.

"Speculation does certainly drive the stock market to an extent, but it is not the base factor. The vast majority of stocks pay the owner dividends, and the value of the stock is based primarily on the belief that they will continue to make those payments. Bonds work the same way except with coupon payments. Speculation shifts the price of the security beyond that, but those coupon payments separate them from bitcoin. 

Speculation is buying an asset with the intention of selling it later and the belief that it will increase in value. That can be done because you saw a trend, or because you understand the market better than the other investors in the market. Speculation is a style of investment, but buying bitcoins at the moment is very different from buying a security. 

For example, a significant portion of my savings is in JP Morgan stock, because I believe they will continue to make dividend payments for the foreseeable future. That is not speculative. A few years ago, the price dropped dramatically after JPM lost a few billion dollars in a day. I thought the market overreacted to this and the price would recover in a few weeks, so I bought some and sold when the price recovered. That was speculation. Investing in Bitcoin must be speculative because there’s no chance of return outside of the price increasing.

"**Proof-of-work system**

A proof-of-work (POW) system (or protocol, or function) is an economic measure to deter denial of service attacks and other service abuses such as spam on a network by requiring some work from the service requester, usually meaning processing time by a computer. The concept was invented by Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor as presented in a 1993 journal article. The term ""Proof of Work"" or POW was first coined and formalized in a 1999 paper by Markus Jakobsson and Ari Juels.An early example of the proof-of-work system used to give value to a currency is the Shell Money of the Solomon Islands.

A key feature of these schemes is their asymmetry: the work must be moderately hard (but feasible) on the requester side but easy to check for the service provider.

**Proof-of-stake**

Proof-of-stake (PoS) is a type of algorithm by which a cryptocurrency blockchain network aims to achieve distributed consensus. In PoS-based cryptocurrencies the creator of the next block is chosen via various combinations of random selection and wealth or age (i.e. the stake). In contrast, the algorithm of proof-of-work (PoW) based cryptocurrencies (such as bitcoin) rewards participants who solve complicated cryptographical puzzles in order to validate transactions and create new blocks (i.e.

"**Socialism**

Socialism is a range of economic and social systems characterised by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as well as the political theories and movements associated with them. Social ownership may refer to forms of public, collective or cooperative ownership, or to citizen ownership of equity. There are many varieties of socialism and there is no single definition encapsulating all of them, though social ownership is the common element shared by its various forms.

Socialist economic systems can be divided into non-market and market forms.

***

**Communism**

In political and social sciences, communism (from Latin communis, ""common, universal"") is the philosophical, social, political and economic ideology and movement whose ultimate goal is the establishment of the communist society, which is a socioeconomic order structured upon the common ownership of the means of production and the absence of social classes, money and the state.

Communism includes a variety of schools of thought, which broadly include Marxism, anarchism (anarchist communism) and the political ideologies grouped around both. All of these share the analysis that the current order of society stems from its economic system, capitalism; that in this system there are two major social classes: the working class—who must work to survive and who make up the majority within society—and the capitalist class—a minority who derives profit from employing the working class, through private ownership of the means of production—and that conflict between these two classes will trigger a revolution. The revolution will in turn establish social ownership of the means of production, which according to this analysis is the primary element in the transformation of society towards communism.

***

**Syndicalism**

Syndicalism is a proposed type of economic system, considered a replacement for capitalism. It suggests that workers, industries, and organisations be systematized into confederations or syndicates. It is ""...a system of economic organization in which industries are owned and managed by the workers.""

Its theory and practice is the advocacy of multiple cooperative productive units composed of specialists and representatives of workers in each field to negotiate and manage the economy.

For adherents, labour unions and labour training (see below) are the potential means of both overcoming economic aristocracy and running society in the interest of informed and skilled majorities, through union democracy.

**State capitalism**

State capitalism is an economic system in which the state undertakes commercial (i.e., for-profit) economic activity, and where the means of production are organized and managed as state-owned business enterprises (including the processes of capital accumulation, wage labor, and centralized management), or where there is otherwise a dominance of corporatized government agencies (agencies organized along business-management practices) or of publicly listed corporations in which the state has controlling shares. Marxist literature defines state capitalism as a social system combining capitalism with ownership or control by a state; by this definition, a state capitalist country is one where the government controls the economy and essentially acts like a single huge corporation, extracting the surplus value from the workforce in order to invest it in further production. This designation applies regardless of the political aims of the state (even if the state is nominally socialist), and some people argue that the modern People's Republic of China constitutes a form of state capitalism and/or that the Soviet Union failed in its goal to establish socialism, but rather established state capitalism.

The term ""state capitalism"" is also used by some in reference to a private capitalist economy controlled by a state, often meaning a privately owned economy that is subject to statist economic planning.

Hey, i just thought of another effect it will have.  When it stabilizes, prices for things you buy in bitcoin will gradually decrease in price. Doh.  But items that are similar but better will get more expensive.  Finally the wonks that come up with hedonic adjustments to inflation statistics, will be able to apply their time productively, because they would be able to accurately measure productivity improvements.

"> Are you saying that you believe bitcoin will reach an appreciation rate above inflation? 

I'm saying that I think bitcoin will replace inflation.  It will do this, because it is going to be an ever decreasing supply of coins.  Most people don't realize it, but the number of one bitcoin is an arbitrary value.  The base unit in bitcoin is colloquially known as a satoshi, and there are 100,000,000 satoshis for every bitcoin.  But in the future, if it is deemed necessary, it will be possible to further divide the currency into ever more fine units.  What you can't do is increase the unit count.

> Because if that happened why would banks ever take on risky loans such as mortgages 

I think house prices are going to shrink significantly, so they will be, by definition, risky investments.  That's the long-term effect of pricking the consumer debt bubble.

> Also I can’t think of a single commodity or security that is a sure fire way to make money,

Yep.  It's risk.  For risk there is reward.  Some risks don't pay off.  Some do.  It'll be important to understand the thing you're investing in.  No such thing as a free lunch.

> I don’t even know what would happen to growth in that scenario

And this gets to the crux of it.  Growth in western societies is a mirage, and has been for some decades.  It has been fueled by finance, which is just numbers on a page.  Productivity, which is supposed to be working less to achieve the same productive outcome, or working the same to achieve growth, has been going sideways or backwards.  That's because people have been rewarded not by increasing productivity, but increasing their share of an inflating asset, i.e. debt based currency.

It is my opinion that growth, as measured in productivity, will increase significantly.  But growth, if, for example, you were in the financial industry, will decrease significantly.  Because our financial system is so geared to that debt-inflation cycle, it will look like growth is going backwards, whereas really, a lot of very rich people will be worth less money.  I certainly don't own, nor will I buy, any bank stocks.

"> Bitcoin was far less volatile 2 years ago than it has been in its last 6 months. I mean seriously look at this graph and tell me you think its getting less volatile.

That graph is linear.  Switch it to a log and look again.

Even better, take a look at actual volatility measurements.  That is, measurements  that show the amount of change (percentage) occurring within a defined period compared to other equal length defined periods.  There has indeed been a small up-tick recently, but overall the trend is towards lower volatility.  One good place to see it in a nice chart is https://bitvol.info/

> Also ""acceptance"" of bitcoin isn't going up. There has been no overall growth in daily transactions in the last year. All that has gone up is the price people are willing to pay, because they all believe its going to be worth more in the future than it is now.

I personally know a lot more people who own bitcoin now than I did a year ago.  It's now talked about more in newspapers and television, accepted by more businesses, and public awareness is generally higher.  I'll agree that the number of transactions doesn't seem to have greatly risen (although over a two year timespan, there is a noticeable upwards trend), but given that it's a store of value that promotes holding rather than spending, I'm not overly surprised by that.

> If you think volatility is a measure of success then coins like Ethereum, Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash are all less volatile/more successful.

I never said that volatility is a measure of success.  You seem to be trying to set up a strawman here.  That said, lower volatility is an expected outcome of increasing success, and also a requirement for certain use cases that aren't practical right now (such as pricing things in BTC directly).

Taking a look at the data, Ethereum and Litecoin have similar volatility to BTC (sometimes a bit higher, sometimes a bit lower).  Bitcoin Cash on the other hand is significantly more volatile.  So I'm not sure where you're getting the idea they're all less volatile than Bitcoin.

> If bitcoin started crashing there is no way you could pull your money out before all the largest financial interests had already pulled their money out.

As I already said though, I have no intention of ""pulling my money out"" unless I am completely convinced bitcoin will fall to zero and *never* recover.  It could crash to $1/BTC tomorrow on the news of every world government declaring it illegal and shutting down every exchange and I'd just buy more because I believe in the fundamental value of the system.

> Treating bitcoin as a speculative asset is not the revolution in economics you think it is.

Another strawman... what makes you think I treat it as a speculative asset or that I'd consider that aspect of it to be a revolution in economics?

> It was meant to be a decentralized currency but people treat it as a get rich quick scheme.

I find it somehow strange that you end your post with this statement.  You're the one treating it as a valueless thing that only has use in trading and has a price held up by speculation alone.  I'm the one arguing for its inherent value.

Yes, I expect that based on my understanding of the system, economic theory, and human behaviour that I will eventually be extremely rich from my BTC holdings; and yes, that is one of the reasons I have the BTC that I do.

If nobody else wants it for a long period of time you may see someone sell at a loss, but if there is consistently volume around the same price point that usually becomes a point of price support. So volume is pretty important, and that is bitcoin being traded as you stated it.

I think you have this somewhat backwards.  The value is driven by supply vs demand.  Trades are an indication that there is an imbalance in market (some people think price should be lower, some think it should be higher).  Trading is an effect, a symptom, of demand.  Trading volume dies down as price stabilizes, as both sides of the market have come to an agreement on the current price.  The price does not approach zero because trading stops, it does so due to lack of demand, which causes trading to stop.;1;1;False;keypusher;dpd0fd8;Lily Allen turned down 200K in Bitcoins for a gig in 2009 which is worth $1,426,199,000 as of this writing;7aq0fx;https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/lily-allen-calls-herself-an-idiot-for-declining-bitcoin-payment-now-worth-millions-9046211.html

"This is a separate issue. Regardless of speculation, the fact that Bitcoin is so deflationary makes it a very poor currency, as you point out. I'm buy it and as an investment, and using it, and also getting as many people as I know to use it as well.

I suppose I can make a disclaimer that as the Bitcoin protocol stands now, I do not think it will survive. As you point out, a currency that is so deflationary is not usable, but using Bitcoin and encouraging businesses to accept it and customers to spend it, only will make it even more valuable. A change will have to be made eventually (IMO removing the 21 million cap and just having a small block reward pay out indefinitely to make up for lost coins and increasing population), before it's useable as currency (or usable as more than a novelty as it is now).

">While that definition isn't wrong, it is extremely dumbed down and you are misunderstanding it. More precisely, socialism (or synonymously, communism) is an economic system characterised by the common ownership of the means of production.

Let me guess, ""real"" socialism has never been tried, right? Few want to give away the ""means of production"" that they spent their entire lives building. So you can't have mandatory ""common ownership"" without an authoritarian government strong enough to take away private property, which is why communism/socialism and authoritarian dictators go hand in hand. Stalin had to kill and imprison thousands of farmers who refused to give up their farms to the state. The result was ""common ownership"" of farms...that under-produced, resulting in mass starvation. It was so bad in Ukraine at the start of WWII, that some Ukrainians actually welcomed the Nazi invasion because it drove back the communists who had been killing them.

>""Means of production"" include things like natural resources and large factories.

And small factories, and mom and pop stores, and farms, and anything anyone built that makes something. Ayn Rand, famous critic of communism, fled Russia and saw her family's small drug store business stolen by communists first hand. So you're making two big false assumptions, 1) that communists only care about ""big"" factories, and that 2) it's ok to confiscate wealth and property from successful businesses of any size. The size of the enterprise is irrelevant. It's immoral to steal from anyone. Period. Venezuela nationalized all their oil fields, and their production immediately lowered and became immensely inefficient because no government bureaucrat or commissar, with no personal incentive by being rewarded with the fruits of their labor, is going to run a public enterprise as well as a private enterprise.

>Any system in which the government owns everything is generally referred to as state capitalism, and is not a form of socialism

Now it's you who needs to look up some definitions. State capitalism is, like socialism, where the government owns the means of production...but also where it runs those means of production for a profit. Therefore, communists Russia et al weren't state capitalists. The communists in Russia weren't running state farms for a profit. Venezuela isn't running state oil fields for a profit. If they were, maybe they'd be marginally more successful, if not still immoral.

>Russia, China and Venezuela are not socialist states, because trade unions or worker syndicates do not control the means of production, government does.

Well, no, Russia's not anymore because the USSR collapsed under it's centrally controlled ""common ownership"" economy. China, although they still call themselves communists, adjusted their economy to a free market capitalist model, because they didn't want to collapse like the Soviets, and because their ""common ownership"" of the means of production resulted in the deaths of millions of Chinese. Venezuela though absolutely still is a socialist state, and was heaped with praise by anarcho-communists like [Noam Chomksy](https://www.greenleft.org.au/content/chomsky-praises-venezuelas-revolution), as a brilliant example of what a true socialist revolution should look like. Now Venezuelans are resorting to eating rats to survive, and all the arm-chair socialists like you are trying to pretend like you've never heard of Venezuela. They **democratically elected** a leader to give them free stuff by confiscating the means of production from all the evil rich people, just as you claim to want. Then ran those means of production, ""for the people"" and not for a profit, just as you claim to want. And it worked...for a few years, until they finally ran out of other people's money, and the entire system collapsed, just like every socialist dystopia eventually does.

You ever wonder why communists are desperate to run away from examples of their failure, like the United Soviet **Socialist** Republics, and re-brand their ideology? Communists re-brand themselves as socialists. Then socialists re-brand themselves as democratic socialists. It's because none of it works, but there will always be political opportunists that will harness your hatred and envy of people more successful than you to ""take away the means of production"" and give it to you. It's a tempting message, but an amoral one.

Thomas Sowell said it best:

>Most people who read ""The Communist Manifesto"" probably have no idea that it was written by a couple of young men who had never worked a day in their lives, and who nevertheless spoke boldly in the name of ""the workers"".";1;1;False;GrabAHamLincoln;dpe91hc;Lily Allen turned down 200K in Bitcoins for a gig in 2009 which is worth $1,426,199,000 as of this writing;7aq0fx;https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/lily-allen-calls-herself-an-idiot-for-declining-bitcoin-payment-now-worth-millions-9046211.html
"**Socialism**

Socialism is a range of economic and social systems characterised by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as well as the political theories and movements associated with them. Social ownership may refer to forms of public, collective or cooperative ownership, or to citizen ownership of equity. There are many varieties of socialism and there is no single definition encapsulating all of them, though social ownership is the common element shared by its various forms.

Socialist economic systems can be divided into non-market and market forms.

***

**Communism**

In political and social sciences, communism (from Latin communis, ""common, universal"") is the philosophical, social, political and economic ideology and movement whose ultimate goal is the establishment of the communist society, which is a socioeconomic order structured upon the common ownership of the means of production and the absence of social classes, money and the state.

Communism includes a variety of schools of thought, which broadly include Marxism, anarchism (anarchist communism) and the political ideologies grouped around both. All of these share the analysis that the current order of society stems from its economic system, capitalism; that in this system there are two major social classes: the working class—who must work to survive and who make up the majority within society—and the capitalist class—a minority who derives profit from employing the working class, through private ownership of the means of production—and that conflict between these two classes will trigger a revolution. The revolution will in turn establish social ownership of the means of production, which according to this analysis is the primary element in the transformation of society towards communism.

"Most of what you have said I agree with, except for this idea that trading volume somehow drives value, which is where we started.  USD did not become the preferred reserve currency because of high trade volume, it did so because for a long time the United States economy dwarfed any other nation, coupled with US dominance of military and geopolitical power.  When investors wanted to put billions of dollars into a currency that would hold its value, they chose USD, which created demand for it.  The fact that it now has high liquidity is a result of that, which makes it even more attractive.

Imagine I hold 1000 btc.  I send them to my friend, in exchange for whatever.  He then sends them back.  We do this all day, for months.  At the end, we are exactly where we started.  Is bitcoin now somehow more valuable because it has been traded more times?  No.  If trade volume drove price, there would be a direct correlation between volume and price.  There is not.  High volume can happen when prices are crashing just as it can when prices are booming.  Volume has a relation to price, and is a powerful factor to consider when trying to predict future prices, but it is not the driving force.  It is changes in supply/demand, which results in volume, that ultimately determines price.

"Posted this [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7adetn/consumers_are_wrongly_perceiving_bitcoin_as_a/dpa887u/) but this is as good a place as any to repost

It has actually taken me years to really absorb the ramifications of this technology, let alone understand it, and there is no question that there is so much more to get. It is pure genius.

I have my own interpretation of the bitcoin invention, that I think reflects my understanding. Maybe I'm just talking shit, but I reckon it's at least a little bit internally consistent. I'm building on it, because it helps clarify it for me.

This is actually a game theory problem. There are three groups in bitcoin. The users, the holders, and the miners. To understand the way that relationship works, you have to understand what keeps everyone separated and honest. That requires an understanding of the incentives of bitcoin, and that requires understanding what [proof-of-work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-work_system) is.

Proof-of-work aligns consensus with the users, because it is the users that are paying the miners. Even holders require users, and more importantly, node owners. Therefore, it is users that are incentivizing the miners. [Proof-of-stake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-stake) aligns consensus with the holders, who are paying the miners. That is an incentive structure that reflects our current financial system. But bitcoin changes this through incentive structures and cryptography. In bitcoin, it is the incentive of the payers, not the paid, that imo is the wild invention of satoshi, and enacted through cryptography.

PoS fails because there is only one outcome given that incentive structure. Holders being miners, and then controlling the users. PoW overcomes this because the outcome is the constant tension between all three.

At the heart of the solution is the byzantine generals problem. The problem is ""if you are a number of generals surrounding a castle, how do you give the attack date and ensure that the message to attack is correctly received, when you know that the message may be altered along the way?"". There's game theory around what is possible, but that's the gist of it. I have reduced it to three. Given you know one is a traitor, how do you deliver the message to attack?

The way that this is managed is that miners order the transactions, and race to hash them to an algorithm (the work in proof-of-work), which is in bitcoin, SHA-256, until they get an answer that they will be accepted by the nodes (proof). They are incentivized to become more and more efficient, and spend more resources as the price increases. The nodes provide the proof in proof-of-work. For that work, the nodes award miners bitcoin. The nodes can prove which miner spent more work, but it sometimes takes a few blocks to get it right, which is why you have to wait for a few confirmations.

The only real thing that miners can threaten to do is stop users (the people paying them) from receiving blocks. Users and holders, after all, control their own cryptographic proofs to the tokens. But the current miners are only miners of SHA-256 pow algorithm blocks. In an adversarial condition, the miners will have just stopped coming to the party, so the users say 'fuck this' and change the pow. They get a new set of miners, mining a new algorithm, and the holders go 'holy shit, do I wanna spend my cash with a bunch of numpties that couldn't behave themselves?'. And they start spending their cash on the chain that the users say is the real one, and everyone just goes about their business again. Old miners get crushed. New miners think happy days. If the nodes change their software, that's the end of the story. Because the nodes define the consensus, they can. The remaining node owners get to decide whether they want to be owned by the miners, or whether they actually want to still remain users. The holders decide whether they are more likely to be able to realize their money with the miners that now control a drastically centralized subset of nodes, or to continue on in the system that led to their being holders in the first place.

Users can't attack the system, because then they would become holders, and users would no longer trust them for the reasons already stated, and they don't hold the cryptographic proofs of the holders. If the holders do that, they lose all of their users, so the only thing they game-theory-wise would do, would be to instate a pow. Why would anyone prefer a system in which the people with the money have all of the power? Otherwise known as the world financial system.

Whoever attacks loses, and there's no real way to cheat the system. That's the brilliant solution to the byzantine generals problem. It is a self-sustaining financial system that rewards everyone for participating in it, where incentives are perfectly aligned for its longevity, with an ever reducing supply of tokens that are effectively infinitely divisible, increasing their value per-capita. And no, there isn't any other system in the world that shares these properties.

"I think bitcoin will finally separate the good debt from the bad debt. It is my personal belief ( as in i don't know of any formal theory ) that debt should only be incurred for the use of building a productive asset. In a deflationary currency, this encourages businesses to ensure that productivity increases will have greater returns than savings. Instead, our financial system has encouraged the acquisition of debt for fixed assets. The only thing this has done us bid up the price of those fixed debts with debt, and handed over the money for supporting that system to banks. In order to stimulate growth in such a system, the only way that you can function is to tax savings. That's what inflation is.

Bitcoin will eventually stabilize to an ever appreciating value asset. But what it will allow you to do is save for a house. If you have a business proposal that encourages people to pay you for a good or service, people will invest their savings in it and take on that risk.

"You’re right, and I’d love to be proven wrong. But I haven’t seen any evidence of early bitcoin successes in large numbers, so it appears that while some people made money, it ends up being a zero-sum game where *more* people lose money by selling prematurely and for less than what they paid. Therefore, at the current time, bitcoin doesn’t appear to be a financially prudent vehicle for *either* a store of value or an investment.

There are different ways to accomplish this, a commonly proposed way is via [worker syndicates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndicalism). They are a theoretically sound way of allowing workers to maintain power, while keeping it decentralised and stable.

Any system in which the government owns everything is generally referred to as [state capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_capitalism), and is not a form of socialism, since the means of production is not democratically controlled. Russia, China and Venezuela are not socialist states, because trade unions or worker syndicates do not control the means of production, government does. People who claim these states are socialist states are not informed, and are generally people who you shouldn't take seriously.";1;2;False;starry7;dpe2ezo;Lily Allen turned down 200K in Bitcoins for a gig in 2009 which is worth $1,426,199,000 as of this writing;7aq0fx;https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/lily-allen-calls-herself-an-idiot-for-declining-bitcoin-payment-now-worth-millions-9046211.html

"> Why recommend they take out a mortgage so that they pay interest to the bank?

Because interest rates are incredibly low right now?

If you have $200,000 and buy a $200,000 house you now have a house and 0 dollars.

If you have $200,000 and you put $20,000 deposit down, you have a house, and $180,000, and have to pay $1,200 for the next 2 decades.

As long as you can make more than $1,200 a month with that $180,000, then you're better off getting a mortgage and using the rest of the money to make money, than you are putting it all into the house.

And if you can't make more than $1,200 a month off $180,000, then you might not be the financial genius you think you are.";4;2;False;suninabox;dpduyji;My BTC, which I've held for only 3 years, are today officially worth more than my 10+ years of investing into my 401(k).;7axesn;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7axesn/my_btc_which_ive_held_for_only_3_years_are_today/

With a hard fork, I assume there would be two separate blockchains.  Given that, you should effectively have two sets of coins.  But, I don't want to steer you in the wrong direction.  I've only passively monitored Bitcoin for a while.  I sold nearly all of my coins a few years ago, because I really could not deal with the crazy ups and downs anymore.  I'm still keenly interested to see something like Bitcoin be a success, but I would personally prefer to use it to pay for stuff, rather than just hold it and hope it goes to the moon.  But the fact I don't have any bitcoins of significance likely means it will go to the moon.  Now if I bought a bunch tomorrow, it would surely tank.

Then just let it ride and see what happens.  Don't buy a bunch now because it's too risky.

So while it’s crazy to say it will hit $30M for sure within our lifetimes, it’s just as crazy to rule it out. We just can’t predict all the variables.

"The S curve of course does top out at some future point, but there are likely multiple S curves for bitcoin at different points in its lifespan. Just last year we had a mini one from 400 to $700+ at the Halvening. Each can be said to be a function of different segments of society realizing there's value here and buying in, with some fraction of them becoming long-term hodlers, naturally.

We haven't hit the Wall St. S-curve yet, that will be the big one, the IPO moment, and when that levels off we will have a years to go yet before it arrives at a final price-discovery level.

It's entirely likely that there's a lot of growth ahead of us, which is why the price is rising rapidly now as more realize this, and realize what's coming. Wall St hasn't bought in yet, maybe privately bbut not institutionally, banks have not bought in yet, central banks have not bought in yet. We've seen articles in which central bank governors have said they may soon need to buy a certain amount of bitcoin to protect their currencies from currency-based speculation attacks.

And when you ask how much bitcoin they might end up holding, each, the figure is something like 100 bitcoin they might be able to afford by the time it comes to this happening.

Anyway, the problem with bitcoin has always been how to express its promise without sounding like a wild-eyed lunatic just trying to pump a fad.

That's much less a problem now than it was before, but the promise of bitcoin has not changed.

Same as with any market, real estate, the stock markets, etc.  Nothing goes parabolic forever.  Whenever you see a sustained run-up in price for a while there is usually some market correction in which prices settle back down.  Even in this current BTC price rally we saw the price nip 5K and then settle down to 3.8K and float around 4K for a while before resuming its surge. That was a minor correction.  When BTC first hit 1000 it was a strong, fast run-up in late 2013 and the market correction brought the price back down to around 400 before strengthening again to 700, then correcting back down to 200, and in that case we had a sustained 'bear market' for about a year, wherein the BTC price floated around 200-300 from the end of 2014 until the end of 2015.  That's a nice long buying opportunity for those who believe in it long term.

Gee, Pension Funds built Las Vegas, and got a nice return. You got all this pension money invested in BS Corporate Stawks, with book cooking on Steroids, Ceo's blowing money like stuff thru a goose, sub prime garbage auto/home loans, etc., etc,. and the market is at record highs, yet all these States with sinking pension investments, where's that money going? What kinds of fees have the States been shelling out for that Garbage? Bitcoin is the Blue Chip of crypto, you know how I can tell? By the History of lives it has improved, not a history of scams like ICO PumpADumps,  etc. I don't want to hear about Mount Gox either, that's not a failure of Bitcoin, it's a failure of an exchange.

"There's no such thing as a risk-free investment. You always take a risk when you live.

It's smart to invest when you see positive expected value _after_ you account for risks.

This is not about predicting the exact price on exact date, it is about seeing the general trend.

And mathematically it's quite simple:

"To be honest, if you never thought of it, that means you should probably do a lot more research. Unless you have access to a cheap or free source of electricity, it's likely not worth it.

There are a lot of overeager people in this sub, many newer to bitcoin than others, who will tell you some things are guaranteed (price going up, price going down, btc pullback will translate into an alt boom, etc.) and I would be wary of those opinions as they're largely uninformed.

"No, you don't pay similar fees. They are magnitudes lower than that. You have choice as a user to use a wallet that allows you to select your fee. 

Sure, it can vary depending on how much you want to pay for quick approval. Users can check the network and figure out what they need to pay for confirmation based on current demand, https://bitcoinfees.earn.com. Relative to one another these fees are minimal. 

Anyone with a bank account had to go down to the bank or website to set up an account as well. Does that hassle outweigh the benefit of being I. The banking system (no). 

PayPal and Venmo. Ha, come on. From a consumer side, I've barely used PayPal to ever pay friends (hence why they created Venmo for P2P payments. 

On the merchant side, google horror stories of using PayPal - you have a high chance of getting your funds locked up for months because you don't fully control your money and don't even get me started in the fraud levels PayPal has. I'd rather receive bitcoin knowing it is going to make it me some time today and once it does I can spend it the same day. 

I guess Venmo is solid for P2P, but you still have to wait on the delay of the ACH system to confirm your money makes it into your bank account 2-3 days later (possibly longer). 

Bitcoin allows you to control your money, transact trustlessly because once you send money there is no calling it back, and if you did your research you would find Bitcoin is the most secure financial network in the world because it is nearly impossible to hijack enough computer power within the system to fraudulently spend a bitcoin twice.

"You’d need the dollar to be worth 0.0007 of its current value.  Which wouldn’t mean 1 bitcoin would be able to buy what 1 billion 2017 USDs could buy, it would just mean nobody uses the dollar anymore.

if the dollar completely tanked and bitcoin 100% took over, you’re looking at bitcoin being worth 2-3million (in 2017 USDs).  So when someone says 1 Bitcoin could one day reach 1 million, they are essentially saying that it could one day be as commonly used in the marketplace as the USD.  Which isn’t all that insane, but the technology has to improve.  Wait times and transaction fees have to go down.

To each his own. I've used BTC for several years, but I still rely on PayPal and Venmo for nearly all of my P2P transfers. They're just more convenient. The fact that BTC allows you to transfer money across borders is not a significant source of value, imo, because once you pay for the coins, account for possible price fluctuation, and pay transfer fees, there's a decent chance your fees are hitting >3%.

">Bitcoin isn't myspace. Bitcoin technology is cutting edge, developers are skilled in unprecedented levels and the techical solutions that are currently deployed are not like anything the world has seen. You can say bitcoin started as myspace and it's becoming facebook if you want to use that metaphor.

So Bitcoin is the first enterprise in all of tech which started as first to market, became market leader and then never ever got taken over by any competitor?

Tech is too innovative of a field for one idea, group, or technology to hold the crown for long. Making any decisions based on the assumption that Bitcoin will never be replaced is foolhardy to say the least.

>Why exactly are people speculating on bitcoin? Because more and more people are using it

a quick google for ""bitcoin daily transactions"" shows this isn't true. there's been no overall growth in use in the past year despite skyrocketing prices.

People speculate on bitcoin because they're convinced its going to make them rich quick. It's the same reason they don't speculate on the other coins because there is not yet the hype that litecoin or ripple will make them millionaires with no effort.


>CME is planning on launching a futures market in it, and it has actual use as an emerging asset class

There was a futures market on tulips during tulip mania. People were convinced that a single tulip bulb was worth more than a house and would be worth even more in the near future. A futures market in this instance proves nothing other than people are attempting to mitigate their risk and profit from a speculative bubble, most specifically because people are going to want to short an obviously over-valued asset to profit from an upcoming crash.

More than that fiat cash is participating a monetary system that devalues the currency that you have in your bank account and investments each day, week, month, and year. Bitcoin is deflAtionary because it has a cap of 21 MM coins.

At BTC's core, you do not need to or exorbitant fees to move your own money. 

On convenience, you must not have friends who have bitcoin wallets. You just take a photo of a QR code and send the amount owed in seconds.

Again, I've got to confirm that it does not take longer to send and receive bitcoin than PayPal or Venmo. Once that money is on its way to your bank account, it will be pending for days before it clears. You send me BTC now and I'll have this afternoon and I can spend or send it where I need to. It is a multitude better than ACH. 

You are correct the value of bitcoin could decline but it could also increase in value. 50/50. If I'm a merchant I can automatically sell BTC for fiat currency to eliminate fluctuation risk.

">Because of network effect that supports the value, biggest of money always wins. Just like USD is winning right now. Other coins are irrelevant, because without the user base they're at significant disadvantage and difference gets bigger and bigger.

So its not the value of the technology then. 

Assuming Bitcoin is going to be worth trillions just because its the market leader is as big an error as assuming Myspace was going to be worth billions because it was the biggest social network.

Actual functional utility of the currency is what will win the day.

the ""store of value"" bullshit coming out now is just bare faced post-hoc rationalizations to keep people invested in a speculative bubble.

It's scarcity means nothing without utility and its utility is actively undermined by artificial scarcity.

>It appears you haven't been following the scene and technical improvements bitcoin is going through. In that time frame daily transaction count couldn't have gone up, because there is some limits in the code that limits transactions that can go through to about 4 transactions per second. This limit has been reached quite a while ago, but we're about to deploy second layer solutions which means instant and free transactions, and pretty much unlimited scalability. Let's see how many transactions really happen when artificial limits aren't a barrier.

None of that disputes the point that the massive increase in value recently has been from speculation, not any increase in the ""network effect"".

"All stocks in your 401k are paying taxes continuously on all their revenues. 

Also, you are assuming that bitcoin is only acquired via a tax burdened salary, and not by trade or as business income, which do not suffer in the same income tax burden. Trading existing assets is not a taxable event. Creating money via debt to purchase bitcoin does not create a taxable event. And business income, while taxable, may be reduced or avoided by normal costs of doing business. (essentially any source of funds flow other than a salary is much more beneficial, and not just for bitcoin)

Also, 401k cash-outs will always pay income tax inevitably, with no possible path for significant legal avoidance. Bitcoin spending may not incur any tax at all in some hypothetical situations, such as if the amount is less than $600, or if your have changed citizenship, etc.

Really?

Do you want me to link to 2013 threads talking about it?

Satoshi himself said that Bitcoin will either become worthless or very valuable.

If you think that Bitcoin's rise was somehow random, you are stupid. There's nothing random about it.

Of course, there was a possibility that there's some flaw in Bitcoin. But 4 years after launch, it was already inspected by some of world's top security experts and academics, so it was pretty safe.

People often confuse randomness with their lack of knowledge and skills.

"> However, there is a level of tax advantages a 401k has but I am sure those benefits will not outweigh the long term potential of BTC.

The tax advantages of a traditional (non-ROTH) 401k are irrelevant compared to bitcoin. The advantage is that the growth (dividends, capital gains) isn't taxed until you begin withdrawing money from the account. But bitcoin isn't taxed until you sell it. If you wait to retirement to sell it, it'll have the same benefits of a 401k. But on the other hand, if you feel like timing the market, you can move the 401k in and out of cash-equivalent investments without having to pay the capital gains. I don't do that.

"It would absolutely be inappropriate for a civil service pension fund to invest in bitcoin at this time. What makes you think that a completely unregulated, high-risk investment is the right investment for someone's retirement funds? If bitcoin, why not doge? BCC? BCH? or any other shitcoin out there. Would you trust the pension fund manager to decide for you? Who would they invest through? What bitcoin fund manager, through what exchanges? Is there one you would trust to drop a few hundred million, a few billion of someone else's retirement funds into? 

It's one thing for a hedge fund to invest in crypto. or individuals. or really anyone investing their own money. But pension funds? No. 

As for Vatican asking for bitcoin donations? I don't see why not, other than political issues. Probably not wanting to deal with the shadow of corruption that may follow. An institution with known financial corruption issues building up reserves and transacting in an unregulated currency isn't great optics, and probably isn't something that the papal bureaucracy is willing to touch right now.

Edit: Just one thought, is that once the market gets large enough, and enough hedge funds get into this game, then I can imagine pension funds dipping a toe in here and there through those hedge funds.

"ITT: Hindsight 20/20.

A lot of people here are talking about how smart an investment it was, and they're not wrong. However, please do not forget that no one here had the foresight of this happening. No one here could have predicted the steep price increase of bitcoin.

So when your friends said to not borrow money to invest in bitcoin, they were right. So I would like to urge to keep this in mind when making future investments, not only related to bitcoin.

That is impressive. My BTC is already 60% of the value of my entire 401k. My 401k is 12 years old and my BTC / alt holdings are only about 2.5 years. I am not sure off hand the amount of up front fiat I have put into each, but I do know I have put a small fraction of capital into BTC as compared to the giant 401k weekly contributions. However, there is a level of tax advantages a 401k has but I am sure those benefits will not outweigh the long term potential of BTC.  ;89;5;False;Nighthawk1121;dpdk77d;My BTC, which I've held for only 3 years, are today officially worth more than my 10+ years of investing into my 401(k).;7axesn;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7axesn/my_btc_which_ive_held_for_only_3_years_are_today/

"This hurts to type, I started getting interested in BTC in 2011, I ended up buying a few here and there a few years later and ended up with 98 BTC.

FML. For reals. I got back in start of this year and am clawing my way back, now I HODL for life. 

It took me a few bottles of cheap whiskey (couldn't afford the good stuff, I wasted it on selling) to get over this.

"Yeah it's a weird situation, I'm making far more money from the growth of bitcoin than my job.

I even did some calculations that if I quit my job and the price kept climbing at at at least 2.4% a week (well below the average of the last 2 years) I could keep living my current lifestyle indefinitely. 

It's a weird situation to be in and I'm immensely grateful to be part of this revolution.

About the only reason I'm not quitting my job right now is that it gives me something to do and I like the people there but it's hard to put up with some of the political bullshit, my boss complains that I come in late and I just look him in the eye and shrug. I try not to be an asshole about it but sometimes I really don't care and I haven't really done much to keep my job but they need me more than I'm being difficult. I do actually work really hard when it's needed and I'm good at my job.

I'm not at the private yachts and lambos level of wealthy but within a year (unless we have another 2013 level crash) I think I'm going to buy a house for cash. I think another recessions coming and credit is going to dry up so there will be a good dip in house prices here.

This is incorrect.  401k is a tax shelter by design, so of course it is relevant.  You never pay capital gains on 401k, even once you withdraw at retirement age.  What you pay is ordinary income tax, but this is just a deferred tax from when you made the initial tax-deductible contributions.  Whereas if you invest in Bitcoin, you are investing money you have already paid income tax on.;35;3;False;whydolwastetimehere;dpdn9na;My BTC, which I've held for only 3 years, are today officially worth more than my 10+ years of investing into my 401(k).;7axesn;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7axesn/my_btc_which_ive_held_for_only_3_years_are_today/

This is my story almost exactly.  I remember back in 2011 reading a debate where one guy was arguing BTC was worthless.  He claimed to have thousands of them on his computer but said it was silly and they weren't worth anything.  He was making fun of people for thinking BTC might be valuable.  Another guy repeatedly offered to buy his Bitcoins for $1 each, but the first guy went quiet (he probably didn't really have any).  I looked it up and found that BTC at the time was trading for $3. I thought it was interesting but then forgot about it until the big run-up in late 2013.  Then I waited for the correction which I knew was coming, and bought my first whole BTC when the market corrected below $500.
