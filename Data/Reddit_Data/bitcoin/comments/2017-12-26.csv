"> Which central bank manages difficulty level?

Bitcoin's monetary policy is written in its code. The reason its stable is because no single authority can change that monetary policy. In fact, its an entirely opt in monetary policy. I see now tho that your definition of ""monetary policy"" is different from mine. Which is why I asked you for your definition. It would be nice if you simply answered my question instead of giving me a snarky response.

> The federal reserve doesn't print money, the US mint does that.

Ok. The FED **creates** money. That's what I meant. In fact, the US mint does not create money, but prints money given to it as existing bills or accounts (including FED accounts). 

> all of your assertions are stupid

All of your assertions are unsupported. I'm also disappointed that you wasted your time. Maybe next time you'll actually write the reasons you think these things and you can actually have a real discussion rather than wasting your time (and mine).

"Such an admirable cause
We are a small salon in Beverly Hills, CA USA
We have a diversified crew of stylists / colorists coming from about 10 different countries and we are making sure to get along well regardless of political views, gender, sex, religion etc. We have lots of applicants from poor neighborhoods that would like to come and train with our experts. We would love to help many of these youngsters to learn and acquire a profession and a license that will enable them to get out of the circle of poverty and live a life they can be proud of.
We are seeking funding for Brighton Salon LLC to put a program together to reach and help fulfill these dreams.

Have you ever heard of Bio Mineral Balance, Alkaline Vegan. Research headed up by a gentleman by the name of Dr. Sebi. He passed away last year. This man has given and studied to rid the body of disease. I have followed many people that have gotten rid of all types of cancers, diabetes, MS, and even AIDS and Herpes. He even beat the Supreme Court many years ago with evidence of such. If you are doing any research I would start there because this is the only group of ppl I have seen consistently and successfully rid themselves of diseases.

I agree with everything you've said but you're sticking to the issue of valuation. What I was referring to is your point that less money than the full market cap of Bitcoin flew into Bitcoin which is obvious to me because a person always buys a fraction of the market cap and not all BTCs available. It's philosophical but most people are bothered by the fact BTCs mcap can increase by $30b in a day even though only $2b were traded which is what I feel your point was as well. ;1;1;False;crogineer;drrwgsw;Don't invest recklessly;7gi55s;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7gi55s/dont_invest_recklessly/
Economically, what you're saying makes little sense. For example, when a startup comes to investors for funding (think Shark Tank), they ask, say, $1M for 20% of the company which gives it a valuation of $5M. According to you, the business isn't worth $5M because investors only gave $1M.

"My point was to get people to think about what wealth even is. Wealth is work, money is a debt of work.

If I have a $1 bill, the world owes me $1 worth of work. This work comes from ""somewhere"" someone actually doing an action to produce something I want to buy for $1.

Since Bitcoin produces no work, Bitcoin is simply a transfer of wealth. The question is from where? If bitcoin doesn't become a directly usable currency in a real sense (aka: not some random bar/restaurant/website) for millions and millions of people, then the wealth ""generated"" by bitcoin is simply a transfer of wealth from late adopters/exiters to early adopters/exiters. If Bitcoin does become a real currency, it becomes a transfer of wealth from fiat currency holders to Bitcoin holders.

To use an extreme example in order to paint a black/white picture, lets say bitcoin shot up today to $1 billion/coin. What this would mean is most of us would be multi-billionaires (or at least millionaires). Could we all suddenly get lambos? The answer would be no because there are not enough lambos for everyone to buy one, all of us fighting for fancy cars, houses, boats would drive the ""price"" of those houses up in dollars to match our new bitcoin wealth. It would massively devalue the dollar as at the end of the day there are no new factories, no new workers, no new materials to support our fantastic ""wealth"" as marked in dollars.";1;1;False;awoeoc;drrx0ib;Don't invest recklessly;7gi55s;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7gi55s/dont_invest_recklessly/

Again I agree with everything you've said. Adding to the point, Bitcoin has a certain intrinsic value derived from its ability to store wealth and keeping it out of the government's reach.

"I'm going to go on a limb and guess Shark Tank is the limit of your experience with financing for businesses. I encourage you to watch many seasons of Shark Tank and pay attention to the sharks and take notes, then read books on startup funding and how investments in the space work, particularly with exits and how most investments yield $0 for investors for a total loss of capital (particularly in companies funded pre-revenue).

I actually started a startup and know how funding for companies work.

Notice how they never pull these numbers out of thin air, there's always revenue attach, and the sharks seem to like sticking to a 3x revenue multiple. When you invest in a company you're investing in a revenue stream, a dividend. A typical company is worth 3x revenue (varying upon industry). So when they give $1m for a company for a $5m valuation, they are either giving it to a company with $1.6.million in revenue, or a company with a high potential for revenue growth.

We're seeking VC funding for a series A investment right now at a 5x revenue multiple based on projected future growth. The types of investors we're seeking are also less greedy than the sharks as they very rarely give a 5x multiple valuation on a company (I watch shark tank enough). Meaning if we made $1 last year, we're seeking a $5 valuation, likely giving up 30% equity. So we'll get about $1.5 in funding (so about a year and a half of revenue).

Bitcoin however produced no work, no dividends, no revenue. Bitcoin isn't a company, there's no business model. There's no way to value bitcoin other than ""feelings"". If you tried valuing bitcoin by a multiple of revenue it'd be worth $0.

"> so idk how that’s supposed to help.

The *idea* behind how it helps is fairly simple (I'll leave it to you to decide whether you expect it to work out). 

Price goes up -> it's still profitable to sell despite the high costs of getting supply into disaster zones -> supply increases.

Otherwise: 

Price is artificially held down -> impossible to profit due to spiked cost of getting supply in -> less supply goes in -> shortage";1;1;False;shockna;drrjsss;Quick grab the offer!;7lg5dt;https://i.redd.it/1lciqvoynf501.png
The idea makes sense in a text book. The problem is that allowing the price to increase doesn’t mean it’s going to be priced fairly according to demand. It’s probably going to be raised higher than that to take advantage of panic and desperation. Non essentials can be priced to the market as you explain but there has to be regulations on emergency goods and services. Sometimes life doesn’t fit the economic model, because financial gain can’t always be the top priority.;1;0;False;val0000;drrlgid;Quick grab the offer!;7lg5dt;https://i.redd.it/1lciqvoynf501.png

"Why it would hit any amount is the question. 1k. 10k. 20k. 100k. moon-k.

There is a certain finite amount of BTC coins = Limited supply

At the same time, and at a global scale, there is an unlimited amount of peoples' desire to have money = Unlimited demand.

The current price of BTC, or any other coin or asset, is where that supply meets the demand on the market/exchanges.

So. When bitcoin hits 10k in 2017 is it the peak? Is it the end-all be-all before the bubble bursts? I think not. Same for hitting 20k and retracing healthily. What will be said when it hits 100k? Right now let's agree that bitcoin has less than 1% market penetration. That is to say, most things cannot be purchased with BTC.. today. 

But what happens once the coin itself becomes more usable and widely accepted? Which coin does Overstock.com already accept? Hint:BTC. (Source: https://www.overstock.com/bitcoin)

Which coin do you think Amazon or Ebay will inevitably adopt when following suit.. Litecoin (LTC)? Maybe. DOGE? Unlikely. BTC or ETH? Yes, perhaps. Only time will tell. Until then, strap on your flame suit and rocket boots and hop aboard.. as there is no time like the present.

Not everyone wants LN (or rather, not everyone wants blocksize to be static until LN comes out), but those that favor LN before blocksize increase tend to be in the BTC camp, and others tend to be in the BCH camp (that's a rough explanation, there are many different opinions)";1;0;False;__blockcyph3r__;drrrxju;The Pirate Bay gets it;7m26vv;https://i.redd.it/odozrxtij3601.png
"I'm glad you get it because the parent commenter you respond to doesn't get it. The argument used is fundamentally flawed.

If I were buying one off item from a store, such as a furniture store because I just moved, I could still use LN. My channel would be connected to someone else, who would connect to someone else, someone else, someone else, who eventually connected to the furniture store.

I don't have to open a new channel for each recipient, I don't have to even close a channel every month or whatever, it can stay open for however long I like (although I'm actually unsure about the technicals on the last point, still learning myself). As long as people stay connected, it'll route through them and do it's thing. No need for a Bitcoin Bank.

Think of it like this: my pc is acting up. You tell me to install team viewer, give over a code, and then you can connect and do the thing to fix it. Does your pc and my pc have to have a cable directly between them? Of course not, the signals go through a bunch of routers and switches and whatnot and the signals reach the destination. Sure, it would be *faster* with the one cable, but not exactly practical. So you trade a bit of latency for the convenience of the Internet doing the heavy lifting for you.

This shit is a bit complicated. Just like bitcoin is. But it is a very awesome part of the scaling solution once it 'clicks' into place.

"no consensus is neede because it is opt-in. If you don't want to use it just don't. The blockchain continues as usual.

You don't open a LN channel for a one-off transaction because it would be more expensive. So in that scenario you just do a normal btc tx.

However what that comment left out is that anyone can run a full LN node, and it seems they won't be that expensive to run. As such you can expect a quite a few nodes which you can use to avoid the big hubs. the whole BB scenario is a bit exagerated imo but who knows how the market will react once it is implemented";1;1;False;MarquesSCP;drrorcm;The Pirate Bay gets it;7m26vv;https://i.redd.it/odozrxtij3601.png

Ripple is a privately owned protocol and centralised by design, allowing transactions to be as fast and as cheap as their

Regardless of capacity, blocks still take on average 10 minutes to be found, so the only difference would be in the fees and not the speed.

There are only two options for total fees to make up for the subsidy halving: current fee rates stay the same and total number of transactions doubles, or total number of transactions stays the same and fee rates double.

Also, I want to go back to your original statement:

">with the hardfork offering that solution, why would Bitcoin see a blocksize change?

The consensus is that block size increases should be a last resort of scaling due to the dangers (hard forks are inherently risky, and larger block sizes can lead to centralisation).

All the long-term scaling solutions *require* block size increases in the long-term, but the attitude (at least as I infer) is that bitcoin can suffer while in the early adopter phase, so issues that affect the long-term scalability can be put into place.

If bitcoin has any chance of being a mainstream, worldwide payment system it needs massive scaling. Smaller block sizes are ideal (decentralisation is a major concern), so making each transaction as efficient as possible will make future scaling (e.g. block size increases) more impactful.

>I'm convinced that the core dev team will not change the blocksize which is the big debate at the moment.

What incentive is there for not increasing the block size? I think even the most tinfoil hat theories of the dev team's motives would have to concede that mainstream, worldwide adoption of bitcoin is to their advantage, and that can't happen on 1MB blocks. If the current situation continues for much longer, people will leave bitcoin en masse. Nobody wins. Except maybe Litecoin.

I'd say the only real question is *when* a block size increase will happen. Obviously it would help the network right now if a block size increase happened. But if other scaling gets here quick enough it might not matter (e.g. the big exchanges could implement segwit and improve their use of batching, reducing the number of transactions and their sizes significantly).

I personally appreciate the need for careful, considered change rather than short-term knee-jerk band-aid solutions...but I'm close to running out of patience with bitcoin, as it is currently completely useless as a currency :(";3;1;False;djgreedo;drrcpc1;The Pirate Bay gets it;7m26vv;https://i.redd.it/odozrxtij3601.png

">what's stopping the hard-fork from adopting Segwit and LN?

I assume by hard-fork do you mean bcash/Bitcoin Cash/BCH?

The main mining power is against segwit because it closes a 'loophole' in mining that gives an advantage when using patented chip technology. Many people believe this is the main incentive behind creating the bcash fork in the first place - because segwit fixes a loophole that happens to be advantageous to certain parties who strongly support bcash (note: at the time bcash forked, bitcoin had a 2x block size increase planned).

There is nothing stopping bcash from adopting LN or similar off-chain scaling in future, but it doesn't take much to see that the supporters of bcash almost unanimously (at least the ones who talk on Reddit) support only on-chain scaling, and they believe that Moore's law will keep the cost of scaling down.

By all accounts, the bcash dev team is small and less experienced than the bitcoin team, and they seem focused on the short term. Scaling to billions of transactions per day (or per hour!) is something that requires a lot of forward thinking, not just 'computers will catch up to bigger block sizes'.

">It's not a long-term solution for the current scaling issue.

That is a strange way of looking at it. Not a long-term solution...because it isn't a short-term solution?

Segwit will have a compounding effect on all future scaling. That's a long-term solution.

Segwit is not a great short-term solution because it relies on mass active adoption to have a big effect. Though, FWIW, full segwit adoption would improve the situation a lot.

>You say it yourself here. If the block size stays the same, the benefit of Segwit is not going to scale.

You're putting words in my mouth there. If the block size remains the same, segwit effectively doubles it (with mass adoption). But the blocksize will not remain the same in the long term, so it's moot.

>but in the context of the scalability issues, it isn't the long-term solution.

I think you're making the mistake of ignoring the fact that segwit is not intended to be *the* long-term scaling solution. It is one of many. The goal is to make each transaction smaller so that other scaling (e.g. block size increases and 2nd layer solutions) have a larger impact.

A 10MB block with segwit can carry almost twice the transactions as one without segwit. A 10MB with segwit and LN can carry hundreds of times more transactions than a simple 10MB block.

"**Network effect**

A network effect (also called network externality or demand-side economies of scale) is the positive effect described in economics and business that an additional user of a good or service has on the value of that product to others. When a network effect is present, the value of a product or service increases according to the number of others using it.

The classic example is the telephone, where a greater number of users increases the value to each. A positive externality is created when a telephone is purchased without its owner intending to create value for other users, but does so regardless.

A related issue, which is brought up in the original XMR (Monero) whitepaper, is that block reward reduction occurs in discrete intervals (halvings).

"> I can't comment because it has never been done on btc or bch and if it was that easy it would have been done.

You are mixing BTC and BCH as if they were the same thing, they are not. The reason it's never been done on BTC is because there was never enough hash power to do it. (Here I'm assuming that all the mining pools are independent and would not collude. Might not be true, and in the future such an attack may happen, but I don't want to start a conspiracy war.) So all the available hash power was busy mining BTC, instead of attacking it. For BCH, on the other hand, the situation is completely different.

The current hash power on BCH is ~15% of the total hash power, with a price of ~0.2BTC. When the price was ~0.1BTC, it was not uncommon to see ~5% of the hash power behind BCH. It is reasonable to expect that this will happen again, if the price goes back to ~0.1BTC. At that point, a 51% attack is pretty trivial for any larger pool. And given that one of the pools was, at least for some time, signaling ""Fuck Bitcoin Cash"" in their blocks, it doesn't really inspire too much confidence for BCH.

&nbsp;

On a different note, when you broadcast and rbf txs, this is opt-in so you are explicitly saying ""Watch out, I might double spend this"". So the merchant will know this. And it remains to be seen how many people lost money as a result of rbf double spends. Erik Voorhees, on the other hand, openly admitted to losing money on 0-conf txs in BTC, and yet he argued to retain 0-conf txs. (I actually agree with him, merchants can decide whatever they want, take the risk or not.) Are rbf double spends really that worse than 0-conf? Please show me some numbers, and I'll happily accept the outcome.

"As an engineer, I find BCH’s complete rejection of layer 2 scaling to be incredibly (and obviously) shortsighted. There’s no way Bitcoin can scale to mainstream adoption by simply increasing the block size.

That said, I also don’t think Bitcoin can scale *without* some modest block size increases, and think Core developers are being too conservative. The orphan rate is currently essentially 0%, and it doesn’t really matter if I can’t run a full node on my 5 year old computer if I can’t afford the transaction fees.

But a contentious hard fork like BCH that attempts to co-opt the Bitcoin branding is reckless.

I can count the number of respected blockchain engineers who support BCH on less than one hand. Gavin Andresen. Not sure who else.

I question the motives of several of the major supporters of BCH: Craig S Wright, Jihan Wu, Calvin Ayer, Rick Falkvinge, Kim Dotcom, John McAfee (though notably *not* Roger Ver. I think he’s wrong, but that he believes he’s doing the right thing for Bitcoin. I also think he’s a dick)

On the other side, I have a lot of respect for the engineers and cypherpunks who have brought Bitcoin this far. The Core developers, Adam Back, Nick Szabo, Slush, and many others. I have a hard time believing they’re all conspiring to mold Bitcoin to fit Blockstream’s business model, as BCH supporters love to accuse.";1;0;False;lightwad;drs59tv;The Pirate Bay gets it;7m26vv;https://i.redd.it/odozrxtij3601.png

"For starters BCash is not the name of the coin, and since BCash is a product that already existed that can be confusing for people who're just hearing about it now. In this case BCash refers to Bitcoin Cash or BCH.

A while back the Bitcoin transactions used to cost a few cents, but with the wider adoption some people realized that 1MB blocks wouldn't be enough, a consensus was achieved that the block size should be increased to avoid the increase in the transaction fees, and meanwhile off-chain solutions researched.

A long time passed and the blocks started to get clogged up, and the off-chain solutions weren't ready, so people started to push about increasing the block size, and pointed that even if the proposed off-chain were implemented it still would clog up because of the volume of transactions.

After a long time asking for the block size to be increased some people decided to go ahead and implement a version of Bitcoin that would work from the original chain but have bigger blocks. That is Bitcoin Cash, it's closer to the original Bitcoin but with bigger blocks, while BItcoin implemented the off-chain scaling solutions (LN and Segwit) but wasn't enough, and now we have higher and higher transactions fee.

If you had bitcoins before August (I think) you have both BTC and BCH, for now BCH is at 1/10 of the transactions in BTC, but the fees are much lower. If it ever gets wider adoption it will have the same problems BTC is facing now, and you can't increase the blocks forever.

"BCH has not technical merits beyond the technical merits of Bitcoin up to about a year ago. But the main problem with BCH is that they are convinced it can scale on-chain, which it cannot. Blockchains are actually awful at scaling because it's basically a very inefficient database. Also, some quick maths should convince you very easily that on-chain scaling is no go. I've written about it [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7l1mi8/mass_adoption_the_scurve_and_why_we_cannot_scale/), focusing on the s-curve and mass adoption. There are many other arguments, but you'll need to google a bit to find articles about those.

"Glancing thru your responses not sure anyone has given the full story, if it’s redundant just ignore me

Basically the core developers introduced Segwit about 2 years ago, (honestly probably closer to 3 now), and it was initially sorta accepted.

The  core plan was to merge segwit, then with the malleability fixes of segwit, to work on lightning network for scaling, then introduce schnorr address, and eventually a blocksize increase (basically go for efficiency, then raw capacity)

Segwit also fixed a bug which stopped ASIC miners from mining 20% more efficiently.

The BCH crew argued that segwit was “too complicated” and that it wouldn’t fix the scaling issues, they argued bigger blocks would lower fees and increase transactions per second, which is correct to a point. It does increase capacity, but you also then have transmit up to 8mb worth of data over the internet. 

For miner in places with slower internet connections this can have a real impact on orphan rates and thus profits. Then you have some arguments about harddrive space (which isn’t a big knock IMO storage is pretty cheap nowadays)

But, IMO, the most damning issue is that they haven’t merged Segwit even after forking to save space on their own blockchain and fix malleability. I think this is so they can hold onto the ASICboost exploit for hash rate.

"BCash's tech is fine, it's just Bitcoin with a bigger block. Of course it works fine. My problem is that it's actively trying to rebrand itself as *the* Bitcoin, the only Bitcoin. Litecoin was a fork of Bitcoin, they didn't call it Bitcoin Lite with a plan to try and eventually become the new Bitcoin so there's no controversy, forks are welcome and part of a healthy open source ecosystem. If BCash provides a tangible benefit that separates itself from Bitcoin it should be able to hold up on it's own name, instead it relies on piggybacking off the brand that Bitcoin has created. If Bcash was called something else like ""Cashcoin"" I really don't think anyone would be paying any attention to it, if it wants to be the most successful cryptocurrency it needs to earn it on it's own right like everyone else.

"It's all about politics.  Bitcoin and it's technology has been around for centuries in relative terms to the crypto world.  After that long in the market, people rise to the top and begin to have opposing views on how the future should look for the currency.   Some have business interests, some have technical interests.   These worlds don't mix.  So in a similar fashion to religions, the political factions split into BTC and BCH.  Now we are witnessing the ensuing battle between these two factions that once were one.  Mis-information through their respective sub-reddits (r/bitcoin is the BTC sub, and r/btc is the BCH sub), market manipulation, etc. Nothing new in terms of a standard political fight. 

At one point prior to the fork, my observation was that BCH split because they had high technological aspirations for the currency, while large mining pools wanted to keep BTC  the way it was for business purposes.    But once the split happened and all the misinformation started, I really don't know because I don't have a high enough level of knowledge and experience to decide on my own..

"Their ""solution"" to scaling will centralize the network of nodes into just a few, expensive hubs. When that happens, the BCash ledger will no longer be immutable or censorship resistant, and without that, the whole technology is just a waste of time and resources that could better be replaced by a couple of data centers with SQL databases.


Another problem with centralizing the network into just a few high cost hubs is that self sovereignty will be ruined, regular users won't be able to verify the correctness of transactions them self. Those few hubs will become ""gatekeepers"" subject to attacks and crack down by authorities.


It may sound strange to some people that this is important, but these are fundamental building blocks of this technology, without them, bitcoin is just a slow, inefficient and expensive system that no longer provide what it once promised, self sovereignty and permissionless access and innovation.

The way I see it, there are two ways to make sure the ledger stays distributed:

1. Decentralize mining. Miners have an incentive to store a ledger and keep it in sync. With thousands of independent miners spread around the world, the ledger would stay safe. This would be in line with Satoshis original vision, unfortunately, mining is no longer decentralized the way it once was. For this to happen, we probably have to change to a ASIC resistant PoW algorithm.

2. Incentivise economic nodes to store and sync a ledger. This is hopefully what the Lightning network will do, introducing a lot of independent, economic nodes incentivised to keep a ledger through the collection of fees. Given that the Lightning network can achieve this, it would be a real scaling solution (massive scale) without sacrificing the most important aspects of bitcoin, as mentioned earlier.";1;0;False;NigelClutterbuck;drrf0np;The Pirate Bay gets it;7m26vv;https://i.redd.it/odozrxtij3601.png

I own both coins as a result of the fork, though I don't believe in the long term success of BCH.  They cling to the original whitepaper of Satoshi as if it was an infallible Bible, never to be improved upon or modified.  As if s/he had 100% of everything **perfect** the first go around when they developed the Satoshi client - as a proof of concept!  

BCH's refusal to suffer even a temporary period of high fees & transactions while we await widespread SegWit adoption so that Lightning can be built on top is shortsighted.  If BCH wants to handle 10,000x more volume, they simply intend to have 10,000x bigger blocks (80 GB? to download every ten minutes, even in regions with poor broadband?).  It's not a long term fix but they resist change.  

The current BCH 7-day-avg-volume of 60k/day is providing low fees & fast confirmations at 8 MB block sizes. The payment network Visa achieved 47,000 peak transactions per second on its network during the 2013 holidays - 4 BILLION per day. We can't just increase block sizes by 67,000x (times 8 MB) in perpetuity if we want to overtake them. It is essential & imperative that we find a solution to have off-chain instant transactions.  Thousands of other cryptos offer tiny fees & tx times.  BTC is building a totally new alternative, while BCH shits on us constantly for being in a temporary slump.  Think long-term, macro scale.  High fees & mempool are a temporary blip on our projected timeline.

I am skeptical of the whole BCH thing because the fork was strongest opposed by miners whose ASICs would not be compatible with the new coin.  They had a lot of skin in the game and resisted the fork.  We had nearly 90% of the best & brightest people/developers/miners in the network support the change based on CONSENSUS.  Not whether or not their personal hardware would still earn revenue after the software improvements go through.

It's like a Rockefeller company who owns a coal-powered electricity empire, vehemently opposing any type of alternative energy research, on the grounds that coal was what was outlined in the original 1904 Municipal Electricity Policy.

"They blocked scaling solutions for years because it made their mining equipment less efficient. They then told everyone ‘bitcoin is shit because it can’t scale, we are forking the coin, removing segwit and increasing block sizes so that we can align with satoshi’s true vision’

Whereas in reality; 1) they blocked scaling for years, if it wasn’t for them we’d be a lot further ahead right now. 2) increasing block sizes means less miners on the network since it uses more bandwidth etc. (Which is good for them, as them they can mine more). 3) they only don’t like segwit because it stops their ASIC advantage. 

Whole point of the currency is that it’s decentralised, bigger blocks removes this and puts more power to the mining companies.

So since I replied I've done some research and what I was talking about before is called block chain pruning and is something that is already done frequently to keep hard drive usage small. Partial nodes are nodes without the entire block chain. Obviously, you are correct in that the most security would come from having all nodes be full nodes, but I don't know how feasible that is going into the future as crypto becomes more mainstream. There has to be diminishing returns the further back on the block chain you go. I do see the need for the entire block chain to be stored in a decentralized manner, though. I hope that LN can be totally seamless, but most descriptions of it seem like, as an end user, I would have a bunch of BTC tied up in certain channels, almost like preloading gift cards to places I do business with.

"> Much easier to attack Bch than btc.

Easier to attack and likely to get attacked are two different things though. Anyone with less hash rate is easier, but it is very unlikely because of the way Bitcoin is designed.

> ABC is the only implementation most people use

I agree, but Bitcoin Cash has only been around for 4 months. I believe this will increase. I am coming out with another implementation soon. Compare this to BTC though. How many people use Core vs anything else, and how many commits are done by non Blockstream employees.

> Go tell r/btc and memorydealer that second layer are good. All I've heard is that ""off chain"" solutions go against ""Satoshi's vision.""

I have heard Roger say that off chain solutions are good as long as they are optional. I agree with him on this. I think when many of the people say it is against ""Satoshi's vision"" they mean that on chain transactions still need to be functional to everyday users. If it is only cost effective to use off chain solutions for paying people, then that isn't even really block chain anymore, so I can see how that would not be Satoshi's vision.

> I know that Gavin was given control. He also thinks that CSW is Satoshi so has proven himself to be fallible. His record also shows that he ceased actively developing btc long before his control was taken away.

I don't know what CSW did to prove he was Satoshi to Gavin. I believe it is possible he proved it to him, but chose not to thoroughly prove it to the world for some reason. So I am not going to say Gavin is wrong unless someone proves him wrong. I don't need to believe CSW is Satoshi. It doesn't really matter who it is to me. I like what Satoshi did, but this is a leaderless movement.

It absolutely is a long-term solution.

Segwit makes transactions smaller - thus more transactions per MB of block space, whatever the block size. With full segwit adoption you get almost double the transactions per block.

With segwit and LN channels that do 100 transactions each, you can effectively get 200 transactions into the block space of 1 regular bitcoin transaction.

Segwit (and LN, and Schnoor signatures) are all about making the blocks more efficient (as opposed to simply making the blocks bigger).

"Wow man, that's golden, you're already frothing at the mouth and messing up your narrative with random statements. I assume you have problems with reading comprehension in addition to a fragile ego (lol ""muh karma"", what an entitled loser), so let's reiterate. You may keep your precious karma (lol), but I care more about the facts. 

You asked a question about technical merits to Bcash. Answer: there are no technical merits to Bcash, as to independent cryptocurency. It's shit. It's about as bad as Bitcoin, except it's faster now but has worse long-term scaling strategy. As a technology, this is worthlessly outdated. One could honestly make an argument that 2mb blocks solve Bitcoin issues a few years ago, however at this point we have coins that are light years ahead; not even implementing any of their best practices (hell, Bitcoin Gold at least switched algo to Equihash) yet talking about improvements just screams scam. Lazy scam to save effort for shilling. And ""Satoshi's vision"" had nothing to do with brand name, so one cannot justify such half-assed anachronistic fork by saying ""but it's Bitcoin, not Dogecoin"". 
Do you understand this? Are you capable of accepting all this as facts?

Further, do you realize that this ""top 3/$51b market cap"" crap you no doubt parroted from one of those BCH echo chambers is ridiculous? This is merely a way to wiggle out of practical discussion by arbitrarily defining what ""matters"" and what doesn't by a temporarily convenient metric. Yes, sure, it's in the ""top 3"", and precisely at third place. It's plain as day that this approach dictates saying ""top 5"" as soon as it falls to 5th place. Cardano – which nobody knew about just a month ago – is at 6th. Will you accept that Cardano is more worthy of being discussed if it gets to the 5th, then? And is $51b some sort of a sacred number to you, unlike 40 or 75? Inspiring confidence, maybe? IOTA made it to 4th place solely by virtue of rumor about Microsoft partnership. This approach is retarded and should be abandoned.  

You say you don't care about either coin but want to make money. I know your type: too greedy to accept the reality that your ""lucky"" investment might not be as good as shills who sell it claimed. Well here's a tip: there's a ton of coins that get pumped and dumped. You can make money on any. BCH isn't in any way special except it profits off another coin's name and reputation. Yes, it got pumped all the way to third place. But its relative gains are unimpressive, as far as altcoins go. 
You're free to bet it'll experience another pump cycle, you may buy high and sell low, but don't delude yourself that BCH will rise to the top because it's ""true Bitcoin"" or whatever, as BCH fanatics do. Its name is literally its only competitive advantage.

"I've read quite a few responses that directly addressed your questions, yet all I see from you is responses on different sub-threads, ignoring the answers already given, and re-asking the same stupid question.

It's pretty obvious you're either an idiot who simply cannot grasp the issues at hand, or you're a bcash shill.

You're completely wrong when you say that ""politics aren't going to determine the values"". That is, in fact, Roger Ver's entire bet, as bcash has no ""technical value"". There's a lot to be gained by bad actors using politics and lies. It's easier to steal from people than it is to do hard work.

Bcash is a line for line copy of the Bitcoin core source code, minus segwit, minus malleability, plus 8MB blocks. If as many people use bcash as use Bitcoin, then bcash would have the exact same issues that Bitcoin has now, and if bcash just upped the block size repeatedly and indefinitely to keep fees near zero, then 1) The coin would be completely centralized by the small number of nodes that could manage to store the gigantic blockchain, 2) The coin would collapse as the block reward diminished, because with little reward, and no fees, there is no incentive to mine. 

That's it. That's pretty much the only answer to your questions that matters, and you re-asking your stupid question over and over isn't going to produce a better answer.

"Ill copy a comment I made to some other dude. It was a response to ""Can someone exlain why people say LN will cause centralization?""

>""The lightnight network allows you to open a channel between two parties. Such a channel is off-chain, meaning any transactions made between the two are (almost) instant and free.

>Such a channel causes two transactions to be put on-chain, one for opening the channel and one for closing it.

>You might imagine having a channel open between you and your local grocery store. The channel would be settled once a month and even with current transaction fees it would be cheaper for the store than paying the banks fees for every purchase done with credit cards.

>So far so good, the LN is great for small, frequent transactions like buying food (or coffee). The problem comes in when buying less frequent things. Maybe you're looking for a new bed for your house. It wouldn't make sense to open a LN channel between you and the furniture store, since you're mostly gonna make big, rare purchases from them. So the LN is no good in this situation, and without it Bitcoin (at its current state) can't be used as a currency.

>Now here comes some guy with a great business plan. Become the middle man between customers and stores that most people don't buy from often. Call it Bitcoin Bank. Stores can sign up with BB and instead of having a channel (remember, channels cost fees to open and close) for every customer they can have one channel to BB. They save lots of transaction fees. Customers can do the same, sign up with BB and save on fees, since they can now buy from every store that BB supports with almost no fees.

"Crypto is a double edged sword.

The community started with amazing technical discussion because, in the beginning, the only people involved were technically savvy as they saw the value of the system through the lines of code they studied.

Crypto was never meant to be JUST for the technically savvy though, it was meant to be for everyone. Bitcoin has gained wide adoption as many non-technical users have climbed aboard who only see Bitcoin as ""magical internet money.""

I don't blame these users for their excitement and exuberance. Anyone that held since the beginning of 2017 has received about a 1500% ROI which is legitimately a lifetime of gains under normal circumstances.

Because of a lower % of technically literate on the code level and an insane ROI, the meme / price discussions have drowned out most technical discussions.

If the prices drop to nothing then I'll still love the technology aspect.  I lived very poor for many years before I finally ""made it"". You know how I got there? By trying to make more money.

I view greed to be a negative thing. I also think it's very easy to call a person greedy because they are interested in making money. I desire money because of the independence it gives me. I value my independence/freedom above many other things. I realized long ago that without  your own money, or someone else's money to fund your pursuits, obtaining independence is very difficult. There's a theory in psychology called Maslow's hierarchy of needs. It attempts to describe and organize people's motivations. It basically says that you can't achieve certain things in life without obtaining others first. For example, you may not be able to ever be in a fulfilling relationship if your basic needs aren't met-like hunger, thirst,safety,shelter. When I was poor I rarely concerned myself with anything beyond my basic needs. I couldn't. Life was a constant struggle. Finding enough money for gas/food/utilities meant sacrificing everything else. Making more money brought me out of a constant quest for survival and has allowed me to enjoy other parts of life that I used to think I would never get to experience.;5;1;False;HoneyNutsNakamoto;drsl2ib;When did the value of crypto become the only thing we focus on?;7m8z0e;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7m8z0e/when_did_the_value_of_crypto_become_the_only/

"Sure. $20 for the pizza and $25 for the fees. Not the miner fees, but the add-on fee that BitPay charges and blames on the miners. Thank you BitMain (who now apparently controls BitPay). 

Where did that decentralized p2p transaction model go? Well, it seems most retailers/vendors can't deal with integrating Bitcoin directly, or still don't have the quick and easy tools to make it happen, or need instant conversion due to volatility.

Don't say I'm shilling. I've been a very strong supporter of the better long term road map and 2nd layer solutions. I get paid in BTC so I really, really want to spend it directly when I can.

"I don't know if many are dropping it but several key businesses are making it unusable except for high dollar amounts. BitpPay, the processor of almost all online places that accept it, nows adds ~$20 on to every payment on top of what you pay the miners as a ""network fee"". That makes it untenable for anything less than a few hundred dollars. LocalBitcoins has had a deposit fee of $25 for many months now making it hard to sell BTC there in the same dollar range. 

One of the mainstays of BTC use online has been hosting fees and domain names. Almost all of those companies that accept it now have to contend with $20 fees being added to their $20-100/mo. bread and butter VPS and small dedicated server range. If they haven't dropped it yet they will once use shrivels up.

IMO BitPay has become another BitMain/Bank controlled bad actor in this field and one that is very damaging to usability way beyond just the miner fee we pay when sending. If I want to pay a $30 hosting fee I can live with an extra $3 as miner fee (and grumble about how it used to be almost free) but when that is compounded with another $20 network fee? It's forced me back to Paypal, and since I get paid in BTC I really, really would rather pay with it. And IMO the ""network fee"" is because they have no way to cover their business model on normal 1% fees, and because they don't improve their internal processing methods (Maybe they need to send multiple txs for every one they receive? Is it really that bad for tx amplification? Or they can't manage consolidation txs on a slower confirmation timescale? Why do they need to charge 6x what I pay for a quick confirmation - riddle me that, except because they can't make ends meet on their advertised 1% take.)";0;2;False;jcoinner;drskag8;When did the value of crypto become the only thing we focus on?;7m8z0e;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7m8z0e/when_did_the_value_of_crypto_become_the_only/

No. We can deal with that but it's because of add-on fees. Fees to withdraw, fees added to miner fees to pay. Fees to deposit now. We are getting hit with fees on top of mining every which way you turn and that is not what Bitcoin was meant to be. It was meant to get us away from that and allow direct p2p transactions. Unfortunately the real world steps in and every business that deals with it adds on another layers of fees, and steep ones too, unless you're paying for >$1000 items and can absorb it (even then with a grimace). Every online vendor that uses BitPay now has to deal with $20 being added to their invoice.

"> Did everyone forget what the original plan was? 

The answer is NO.   Bitcoin is a transformative technology that is going to bring a LOT of value to the world in the long run if it catches on.   SOME of the people in the community are also excited  that the sudden financial community hype has highlighted a chance to enrich some individuals who bought in early: in the short run.

These are the early adopters who had to take on some risk though to be in a position to have a chance at that reward.  BY THE WAY:  You're still an early adopter if you start obtaining crypto from an earlier user and using cryptocurrency today for transactions.

> coin ""going to the moon"" than helping others.

Greed has been highlighted, but it's not the only thing.   Greed exists with the fiat system too,  but it's the bankers enriching themselves  instead of the common people.

All I could say is greed is PART of it,  and we should direct some attention to the other benefits of crypto too and encourage people to experiment and explore using only $$$ they can afford to lose.

"Let's say a service has 100 withdrawals of 0.5 BTC in an hour and initially has 1 input (deposit) adress that has 70 BTC.

Typically if it would make a transaction for each withdrawal, you would get a chain of transactions. So the first withdrawal is: 1 input (initial 70 BTC), 2 outputs: 0.5 to the withdrawal address and ~69.5 BTC to the change address. Second withdrawal is: 1 input (that ~69.5 BTC change address) and 2 outputs: 0.5 to the withdrawal address and ~69 BTC to the new change address. Etc.

By batching the withdrawals, they could do 1 big transaction every hour (or x minutes) with all transactions. So this would require: 1 input (initial 70 BTC), 1 output for each withdrawal (100x 0.5 BTC) and 1 change address (~20 BTC) for all withdrawals. So this drastically reduces the amount of inputs/outputs and therefor making the total transaction size for all withdrawals much smaller.

Overall this massively decreases the space it needs in the blockchain (and therefor reduces the mempool and fees if more services use it.) It is generally only relevant for services that do a lot of transactions (and they save fees themselves already if they use it.) But in theory users could also do it, by waiting till you need to make multiple payments and then sending money to multiple addresses in 1 transaction.";9;0;False;NLNico;drs3361;Day 4: I will repost this guide daily until available solutions like SegWit & order batching are mass adopted, the mempool is empty once again, and transaction fees are low.

"I am pro Core because they’re the best developers and are first and foremost concerned with network security/decentralization, which is how it should be. 

I personally am also in favor increasing blocksize but Core is concerned that bigger blocks would mean fewer nodes/more centralization due to the increased sync time. I️ have no clue if Core would increase blocksize if we increase nodes, but I suspect it would help our case and it’s good for network security anyway.

As I said in my comment - Core doesn’t think that bandwidth or storage is the issue.

"No it doesn’t. My theory is that if Core Developers felt comfortable that there were sufficient extant nodes, they may feel comfortable increasing blocksize even though it would increase sync time. 

For example: If there are 10,000 nodes at 1mb blocksize and core estimates that increasing blocksize to 2mb will reduce nodes to 5,000, they won’t increase. 

But if there are 100,000 nodes at 1mb blocksize, Core may feel OK with increasing blocksize because it would reduce nodes to 50,000, which they feel is an acceptable level of decentralization.

"You do not need to run your node 24/7 365.

By running a full node and using it for transactions, you are actively enforcing network rules and cannot be forced onto changes by anyone else. A small group of businesses and miners cannot force changes to the rest of the community that runs and uses full nodes. *That* is the power of running a full node and the power of decentralization.

This is besides the regular advantages: security (fully validate all TXs), major privacy advantages, more nodes on network makes it more resistant against attacks/DDoS, etc.

So overall, you can definitely just run your full node only when you need it (you might need to run a few hours every time to catch up the latest blocks.) Of course it's nice to run your node 24/7 365, especially if you have fast internet speeds, so you can actively help new nodes setting up, serve SPV wallets, etc. But the main advantages of running a full node don't require that, in my opinion.";26;2;False;NLNico;drs005v;Day 4: I will repost this guide daily until available solutions like SegWit & order batching are mass adopted, the mempool is empty once again, and transaction fees are low.

"No, soft fork would be enough. Soft fork makes previously valid blocks invalid so you can tighten rules.

Also, without any forks Bitcoin Core can make, e.g. the transactions to legacy addresses non-standard. After nodes upgrade, it would be difficult to find a node that would relay such transactions and people would have to switch.  Sending from would be unaffected so no problems with spending from legacy addresses.  

However, both changes would be pretty controversial so it's unlikely to be implemented.

"One of Bitcoin's strengths - the most important in my opinion even - is the low degree of trust you need in others.
If you use a full node for your incoming transactions, you know that there was no cheating anytime in the history of your coins:
•	Nobody ever created money out of nothing (except for mimers, and only according to a well-defined schedule).
•	Nobody ever spent coins without holder their private key.
•	Nobody spent the same coins twice (but see further).
•	Nobody violated any of the other tricky rules that are needed to keep the system in check (difficulty, proof of work, DoS protection, ...).
... with one exception: because there is a need to pick a winner in presence of multiple competing valid versions of the ledger, (a majority of) miners have the authority to pick the version of the block chain that wins. This means their power is limited to choosing the order in which otherwise valid transactions occur, up to and including the right to delay them indefinitely. But they cannot make invalid transaction look valid to a full node.
If you are not running a full node, the amount of trust you're placing in others increases.
•	SPV nodes (such as some mobile clients, and Multibit) place a blind trust in the majority of miners, without checking validity of the blockchain they produce. It still requires a majority of miners to mislead an SPV node, but they can make it believe anything (including ""You received 10000000 BTC!""). The reason why this does not happen is because full nodes would not accept such blocks, and assuming a large portion of the ecosystem does rely on full nodes, miners who do this would not see their blocks accepted by the larger economy, resulting in them wasting money.
•	Centralized services (most webwallets) make the user trust whatever the site says. They can claim anything.
So I hope you now see the importance of full nodes in this model. If you run a full node somewhere on the network, and nobody looks at the transactions it validates, it is indeed contributing to the network, but it is not helping with the reduction of trust.
Look at it another way: if only a few large players in the Bitcoin ecosystem were running full nodes, it only requires a malicious intent, or an attack/threat against them, to change the system's rules, as nobody else is validating.
Doing transactions in the Bitcoin ecosystem helps the Bitcoin currency. 

Running a full node helps the network. Using a full node helps you and the ecosystem reduce the need for trust.

"Thank you for this, it helped me a lot.

It would be great if we could understand the source of the majority of the non-SW transactions (assuming it does not exist now) to target this information to that group. For example, it's convenient for me to use mycelium and find someone locally to sell me Bitcoin for cash.  Since this app isn't updated for SegWit that could mean many non-SW transactions. Same thing for the exchanges people use that aren't updated.

With the growing population that is buying Bitcoin directly, this post has helped me understand the compounding problem.

">the mempool is empty once again, and transaction fees are low. 

170k unconfirmed transactions = mempool empty? WTF? [It's no where near empty](https://blockchain.info/charts/mempool-count?timespan=1year)

And [transaction fees are still sitting near an all time high of $40 on average](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-transactionfees.html). I mean the whole reason why transaction fees increase is to decrease network congestion. Bitcoins recent problems with scaling isn't simply because of some malevolent actor(s) spamming, it's because of network growth.


It's a victim of it's own success.

"FYI: Bitfinex has a [public hot wallet address](https://blockchain.info/address/1Kr6QSydW9bFQG1mXiPNNu6WpJGmUa9i1g) and you can see they do batching (perhaps not in an ideal way, but at least some batching.)

IMO at this point '*Ready*' for Segwit is silly. There are just 3 options: **segwit p2sh**, **segwit bech32** or **no segwit** (of course they might wait for bech32 until more wallets support it.)

Another interesting status to follow is '*Send to bech32 status*'.. if the wallet/service allows sending/withdrawing to native segwit (bech32) addresses.

edit: overall I would recommend to make it like this:

| Exchange            | Batching Status | Segwit Status | Withdraw to bech32|
|---------------------|-----------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Binance             | **Yes** 		| No 			| ? 				|
| Bitfinex            | **Yes**			| No         	| ? 				|
| Bitonic             | ?         		| No            | No 				|
| Bitstamp  		  | **Yes**  		| **Yes**, p2sh | ? 				|
| Bittrex             | **Yes**			| ?             | ? 				|
| Coinbase/GDAX       | No     			| No            | ? 				|
| etc.

Of course I don't expect services to use bech32 until other services and wallets support sending to bech32. But at least this way we encourage them to think about it already. And I hope they can enable sending/withdrawing to bech32 already (this is just adjusting some validation script - relatively very easy.)";78;8;False;NLNico;drrt87g;Day 4: I will repost this guide daily until available solutions like SegWit & order batching are mass adopted, the mempool is empty once again, and transaction fees are low.

"Sorry if I'm posting this in the wrong place, but let me know if I understand this right:

If everyone adopts Segwit addresses, transactions will be much faster, and transaction fees will decrease? Is this right?

I've been asking other forums about Segwit and I've been told it wasn't helpful. I'd like to reach out here to see if there's any more info that I wasn't told about. I'm guessing ""it wasn't helpful"" because it's just not being used yet? 

If so, does anyone have info to point me in the right direction for the following questions? (I don't mind reading - send links my way):

* What's slowing people down from adopting Segwit? Is it a time consuming process, is there risk involved, is it laziness, or something else? 
* Once Segwit is FULLY adopted, what do we see the fees/transaction times going to? 
* What determines fees, to begin with?
* Are non-Segwit addresses still able to be created, or are all addresses moving forward going to be Segwit?

Thanks in advance!

"Batching saves about 80% of size in the outgoing transactions (by not producing change over and over). But segwit saves 40-60% of the receiving addresses consolidation (or the size of the inputs if there is no consolidation). They are both complementary.

"OP, you are spreading misinformation.

If there were a 138,000 tx backlog, segwit blocks could hold up to 8,000 tx (doubtful but let's go with it) and transactions were 100% segwit, then the backlog WOULD NOT disappear instantly.  

138 / 8 = 17.25 blocks.  17.25 blocks is not instant.

And that assume there are no new tx entering the mempool.  

New tx constantly entering the mempool so it would take longer.

Also if there wasn't such a large backlog and high fees people would transact more (I know I avoid BTC tx because of the backlog) so you assume the lower cost does not increase demand.  

But lower prices increase demand.  This is economics 101 (and common sense).

"Wanted to hop on the top comment to also ask people to please spin up a full core node if you haven't already done so. It takes ~150gb of disk space and 4-7 days to sync.

Evidently one of Core's primary concerns with increasing blocksize is that the syncing time will grow exponentially, and it will discourage people running nodes, thereby decreasing decentralization.

If we can get enough nodes up and running and prove that how long it takes to sync a node isn't a factor in whether people will run one or not, Core might consider raising blocksize in addition to the Segwit and Lightning improvements. (Note: Core hasn't said anything to me that they would ever consider raising blocksize, I'm just speculating based on a couple twitter interactions I've had).
