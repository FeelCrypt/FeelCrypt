I don't even get what vqpas is trying to say. But anyway, the level of vitriol being upvoted on this thread kinda validates my point. A lot of people are abusive and condescending to journalists, and it's rarely warranted. If you're intelligent, rational and polite enough to air your objections in a reasonable manner - like Erik did - then more power to you, whether we agree or otherwise. But if you only know how to spew personal hate and peddle conspiracy theories, then frankly you don't deserve an audience.;-4;1;False;riverScrap;cfpflbj;Open Letter to Michael Casey - WSJ reporter who butchered my comments in today's Bitcoin cover story;1z010y;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1z010y/open_letter_to_michael_casey_wsj_reporter_who/

 [**Going concern**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Going%20concern): [](#sfw) 

---

>A **going concern** is a [business](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business) that functions without the threat of [liquidation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidation) for the foreseeable future, usually regarded as at least within 12 months. It implies for the business the basic declaration of intention to keep running its activities at least for the next year, which is a basic assumption to prepare [financial statements](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_statements) considering the conceptual framework of the [IFRS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Financial_Reporting_Standards). Hence, the declaration of going concern means that the entity has neither the intention nor the need to liquidate or curtail materially the scale of its operations.

"Again, I don't see how he was misrepresented? The direct quotes and the basic inferences are accurate. True, you may sense a deeper inference in the selection of that specific quote above others, but are you seriously claiming that journalists should ensure every single party is happy with *every conceivable inference* - justified or otherwise - in the structure of their articles? That's a Monty Python newsroom. Nothing would ever get published.

It's this notion of journalists ""doing it wrong"" that is flawed. I write about 100,000 words per year, mostly features. I, like most journalists, am pedantic and anal, but every year some errors will creep into those 100,000 words. When that happens, are you justified in hoisting up my one single mistake, and telling me I'm bad at my job?

Most professional journalists who avoid getting fired have probably got a 99.99% success rate in their writing. It's lazy and dishonest to uphold the 0.01% of errors as evidence that a given reporter is incompetent or unethical. Moreover, it might not be their fault.

Edit: Sources updated. Re-evaluating. Temporary credibility level: B

Edit 2: Link corrected to rt.com, businessinsider article confirming added, as well as triple-cited Wikipedia line confirming the same. Relevant quote from RT, quoting Rep. Thornberry's initial press release :

read: we choose not to define this as 'propaganda'

> and, in fact, specifically ensures that the content to be rebroadcast or republished domestically by the Department of State and the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) shall not influence public opinion in the US.

...what? So...they're only going to broadcast material so neutral that it cannot affect opinion? Or only broadcast so that people can't see?

> It clearly states, no funds authorized to be appropriated to State Department or BBG for any activity shall be used to influence public opinion.”

And in fairness, he did butcher your name. But like it or not, the quote is 100% accurate. And he is under no legal, ethical or journalistic obligation to convey the underlying message of your interview. Many of us-- including myself-- have given long interviews to journalists only to see a few quotes (not of our choosing) used in the eventual article. Once you make the realization that that's the ordinary course of events, you start to think that folks believing journalists have some sort of ethical obligation to recreate the spirit of an interview rather than merely use selective quotes to fill out an article are a bit naive. ;-1;0;False;notjakers;cfph461;Open Letter to Michael Casey - WSJ reporter who butchered my comments in today's Bitcoin cover story;1z010y;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1z010y/open_letter_to_michael_casey_wsj_reporter_who/

The problem is that you're failing to understand that the interview was not about YOU, it was about BITCOIN. While it may not be important to YOU that you lost many Bitcoins, it's important to the people reading the article. That's why it has been quoted.

This is where you fall off the path entirely. Journalists - especially investigative journalists - are absolutely essential to a healthy democracy. Someone with NYT credentials can dig into a story, question people and expose wrongdoings that no one else can. Certainly not 3rd tier bloggers.

"Based on OP's description, I'm not sure he was misrepresented. The reporter was just very selective with which quotes he used.

I understand that bashing journalists is a popular sport, and it's expedient to argue that most of us are lazy and unethical. But again, put yourself in the reporter's shoes: you cover countless different subjects, few of which you'll ever become an expert in; you have very high-pressure turnaround times for copy (especially on a print newspaper); and you've got an editor barking often unreasonable demands at you. You need expert comment, so you talk to as many people as time permits, and then you frantically listen through the recordings to pick out what appears to have been the most on-topic remarks. In this case, clearly the loss / potential theft of millions of dollars of bitcoins lies at the heart of the story, and the reporter was correct to focus on that.

Let me put it another way: on very, very rare occasions, I'll talk to someone and not use their quotes in an article. Maybe they were off-topic, maybe they weren't particularly eloquent, or maybe the clock just beat me to it and I had to deliver whatever copy I had available by the deadline. Does that make me a bad journalist? Can you honestly say you'd never encounter the same scenario, if you did this job day after day, month after month, year after year?

It's easy to criticise hacks; that's all I'm saying. By definition, journalists have the fine detail of their work scrutinised every day by thousands of people.

"Hmmm.

Ok so here's a zinger for them. I ran the software development division of a multi-national, listed company (in South Africa) for a number of years. I was head-hunted for that role after successfully selling a previous company I started. I reported only to CEO, the COO, the CTO, and the board. My paycheck was...large.

Of course, the job was ridiculously stressful - up at 5:30am dealing with Australia and Hong Kong, deal with local issues during the day, back home at 7pm-10pm after dealing with the US. My family life suffered, and I could see that my wife was unhappy.

Towards the end of 2012 I quit to start an import/export business, which blossomed into a group of companies, several of which are involved in providing products and services that hinge on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. As of October, 2013, I have stepped back from any operational involvement in all of the non-Bitcoin related companies in the group, and am fully focused on our cryptocurrency related endeavours.

So that makes me wonder how and why they come to that conclusion? I mean, I can send him my paystub from when I still held my last full-time role to prove them wrong, but surely that sort of opinion is just provably incorrect and silly to hold?

I think it will actually turn out awesome for them. The price showed pretty solid support at ~800 for 2 months and showed good resistance throughout this turmoil at $500. To be able to get people to sign up to their pegged accounts with bitcoin at $550-650, they stand to benefit when the price rises back to $800 and beyond. If they'd opened earlier when bitcoin was at $800 and had to top up everyone's accounts throughout this dip, it would have made things much more difficult for them. ;2;0;False;whipnil;cfpi9cj;Open Letter to Michael Casey - WSJ reporter who butchered my comments in today's Bitcoin cover story;1z010y;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1z010y/open_letter_to_michael_casey_wsj_reporter_who/

"I was quoted in the Wall Street Journal once. Different reporter (Joseph De Avila), same outcome. I'd sent in reams of information in writing and followed up with a phone call.

There's a reason they have developed a bad reputation over literally thousands of years.

"The title caught my eye when I saw my WSJ sitting outside today.  Read through it and felt like it was repeating really the same mainstream ideas.  However, besides the somewhat misleading title, I didn't feel the overall piece had any type of agenda.  It really brought points from both sides of the equation.  A lot of doom and gloomers as well as a lot of optimistic investors.

However I can see your frustration.  The way that they just cherry-picked lines from your actual interview to completely change your view on the subject is bad journalism and just unethical.  The WSJ of all places should have a bit more integrity than that.

"Erik, I know how you feel. I've done alot of interviews for pizzaforcoins. Most have always gone well, but there's the occasional journalist who should not be doing news, and instead has the writing styles of a low life national enquirer. They take quotes out of context and can make things you said sound completely the opposite of how the conversation went. 

Sorry you had to deal with that. The good news at least is that MOST of the media that I have heard the last few days has been surprisingly accurate and semi positive. Most stations in my area (Los Angeles) did a bundled story where they headlined with the troubles at gox, but finished by talking about second markets exchange plans slated for this summer. A sort of ""out with the old in with the new"" I was very pleased by MOST of te coverage.

"Erik, 

A long time ago, in 1995, I was the first person banned from the Internet, and my case was in the news.  An honest journalist once told me something very important that I never forgot.  I was asking him if he could include certain things in his article.  He said:

> ""Chris, you have to understand that journalists are not your PR agency.  Journalists have their own agenda.  They are going to write whatever story they want to, or whatever story their editor told them to write.""

Any honest journalist will tell you something similar.  Unfortunately, not enough journalists care about writing an accurate story.

Lessons learned: record all interviews in their entirety, regardless of with whom. Firstly, simply knowing they're being recorded may discourage the most egregious of misleading journalism. But beyond that, not only will it allow you to challenge selective quoting, but it can be a good resource for the community. I know that I have enjoyed listening to a few instances where a libertarian published a full recorded interview with a newspaper or magazine. It's interesting to hear the questions asked and to hear the response given in real time. Not only informative, but also helps sharpen my own points.;4;1;False;tocano;cfpd51k;Open Letter to Michael Casey - WSJ reporter who butchered my comments in today's Bitcoin cover story;1z010y;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1z010y/open_letter_to_michael_casey_wsj_reporter_who/

"> you were happy to completely ignore my sentiments, preferring instead to cherry pick the one fact that is least important, in order to paint a narrative

I'm a journalist. Everyone who talks to journalists should understand that this is how the job works. In news reporting, as opposed to feature writing, 90% of every interview is glossed over, and tbh I'm not sure it's a bad thing. The interviewee's remarks should help shape the journalist's understanding, but the interviewee has no right to expect that certain remarks / angles will be quoted / reflected in the article.

It may seem unfair, but that's how journalism works. Put yourself in the reporter's shoes, and it's not hard to see why. So IMO you should just take this as a lesson to be more sceptical. And if you want to engage with the media, hone in on either a reporter you trust, or a *feature writer*. The latter will be much, much more willing to use lengthy quotes.";-3;4;False;riverScrap;cfpb8o5;Open Letter to Michael Casey - WSJ reporter who butchered my comments in today's Bitcoin cover story;1z010y;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1z010y/open_letter_to_michael_casey_wsj_reporter_who/

"There are different strategies in the war of ideas.  Trolling seems to be effective propaganda, and simply downvoting them gives them extra ammunition for them to be able to declare and demonstrate victory.
