"**Precious metal**

A precious metal is a rare, naturally occurring metallic chemical element of high economic value.

Chemically, the precious metals tend to be less reactive than most elements (see noble metal). They are usually ductile and have a high lustre. Historically, precious metals were important as currency but are now regarded mainly as investment and industrial commodities.

***

**Gold standard**

A gold standard is a monetary system in which the standard economic unit of account is based on a fixed quantity of gold. Three types can be distinguished: specie, bullion, and exchange.



In the gold specie standard the monetary unit is associated with the value of circulating gold coins, or the monetary unit has the value of a certain circulating gold coin, but other coins may be made of less valuable metal.

The gold bullion standard is a system in which gold coins do not circulate, but the authorities agree to sell gold bullion on demand at a fixed price in exchange for the circulating currency.

***

**Silver standard**

The silver standard is a monetary system in which the standard economic unit of account is a fixed weight of silver.  The silver specie standard was widespread from the fall of the Byzantine Empire until the 19th century. Following the discovery in the 16th century of large deposits of silver at the Cerro Rico in Potosí, Bolivia, an international silver standard came into existence in conjunction with the Spanish pieces of eight. These silver dollar coins played the role of an international trading currency for nearly four hundred years.

***

**Medium of exchange**

A medium of exchange is a tradeable entity used to avoid the inconveniences of a pure barter system. The role of medium of exchange is one of the uses of money.

By contrast, as William Stanley Jevons argued, in a barter system, there must be a coincidence of wants before two people can trade: one must want exactly what the other has to offer, when and where it is offered, so that the exchange can occur. A medium of exchange permits the value of goods to be assessed and rendered in terms of the intermediary, most often, a form of money widely accepted to buy any other good.

***

**Commodity**

In economics, a commodity is an economic good or service that has full or substantial fungibility: that is, the market treats instances of the good as equivalent or nearly so with no regard to who produced them. The price of a commodity good is typically determined as a function of its market as a whole: well-established physical commodities have actively traded spot and derivative markets. Most commodities are raw materials, basic resources, or agricultural products, such as iron ore, sugar, or rice.

***

**Fiat money**

Fiat money is a currency without intrinsic value that has been established as money, often by government regulation. Fiat money does not have use value, and has value only because a government maintains its value, or because parties engaging in exchange agree on its value. It was introduced as an alternative to commodity money and representative money. Commodity money is created from a good, often a precious metal such as gold or silver, which has uses other than as a medium of exchange (such a good is called a commodity).

"> What do you mean by this? Bitcoin is a trust*less* system.

The blockchain provides trust in certain properties of a transaction. It's only trustless in the sense that you don't have to rely on individuals or individual corporations to validate a transaction - instead, the blockchain provides that trust. So ""trustless"" here just means that the locus of trust is distributed and difficult to attack - in that sense, the blockchain is a ""trust platform"".

""Trustless"" can also be misleading: if I pay an online vendor for some product or service, I'm still trusting the vendor to provide that product or service. 

The only sense in which trust changes in an ordinary Bitcoin transaction is that neither party can get away with fraudulent claims about whether they've made/received payment. This can be an improvement over banks, which can make resolving disputes difficult in some cases since there tend to be at least two banks involved in a transaction, each of which enforces privacy on their customer's transactions.

More sophisticated use of blockchains can provide similar trust features to other aspects of transactions - particularly with products or services that can be transferred digitally, in which case it's often possible for blockchain to provide trust on the entire transaction.

"Gold has (a fair amount of) non-monetary use-value: in other words, what sustains its current (long-run) prices, is speculation about future demand for gold in jewelry, electronics, etc.

A bitcoin token has very little in the way of non-monetary use-value: you can't eat it, make anything out of it, serve many ends with it (it can serve the ends of novelty and technical curiosity, which were probably a large part of the initial bootstrapping of an exchange price for the token...but that's another tangent we could discuss).  You can't say that it is very useful for transferring value or running smart contracts...if the token doesn't have much or any of its own non-monetary value...it becomes kind of circular logic.

So how then does a bitcoin have value at all?  Because its exchange price is sustained by (long-term) speculation that Bitcoin can be bootstrapped into an actualized money (unit of account, store of value, medium of indirect exchange). Because once a token or commodity is ensconced as money; it no longer needs to reference other non-monetary uses for it to have value: a medium of indirect exchange is valuable in itself (alleviates barter inefficiencies), a unit of account allows us to better calculate opportunity cost and is useful in itself...a store of value is useful in itself, in short run inertia, but ultimately also must reference the other two monetary services.

In fact, all three are dependent upon, and feed back into, each other.  It is a highly tenuous prospect that bitcoin can be bootstrapped into position as a money...but if or once it does, it must serve to some relatively high degree as all three things, in order to have stable, self-sustaining monetary value.";3;0;False;kwanijml;e2y26ms;Love reading LinkedIn idiots.;91ad3y;https://i.redd.it/p9wb3dm46rb11.png
