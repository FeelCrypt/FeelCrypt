"Your last sentence says it all, We don't know who Satoshis is or anything about him/them other than they currently own around 7 billion in bitcoins, that's a lot of reasons to hype the value.

Bitcoin was intended to be a universal currency used daily to buy and sell goods and services, it was never, ever intended to be an investment vehicle.  Bitcoins themselves have no value other than  what people agree they are worth, businesses that issue shares, bonds that guarantee a return or physical objects like real estate, gold or diamonds have a fairly fixed value and can be held or used for a purpose even cash has a value because it is backed by a country and it's assets.

Bitcoins have none of these things, people are simply following the [Greater Fool theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_fool_theory), in fact they are the text book example of the theory.  I had great hopes for bitcoin as a currency but it has now turned into an investment vehicle so no one is spending them, companies like Dell are no longer accepting them and the value and fluctuation has made them unsuitable for a currency anyway.  Do you buy a Mercedes today with them or wait a week and get a Ferrari or possibly a Hyundai in 2 weeks?  If a company accepts them they may loose 10 or 20% before they can clear them and sell them, the dealer sells a car for a hundred bitcoins and the manufacturer want either 80 or 120 to replace the stock 2 days later.

"The theory doesn't depend on miners keeping their coins. The theory is that miners have expensive equipment that helps them mine more coins in the future, and therefore they don't want to do anything now that makes the value of those future coins lower, so they'll behave in a way that's good for Bitcoin.

"It adjusts, but only every 2016 blocks, and that's exactly the problem we're in now.  A massive amount of hashpower has left Bitcoin, causing block times to slow down.  Bitcoin will adjust, but we have to wait 1,849 more blocks until the next adjustment.  Because block times are now so slow, 1,849 blocks is a LONG time.  We're looking at 25+ days until the next adjustment at the current rate.

However, the reason Bitcoin lost so much hashpower is because Bitcoin Cash had a crazy low difficulty.  Massive amounts of hashpower going into Bitcoin Cash causes their blocks to speed up, making their adjustment time faster and their adjustment up higher.  They're about to have a huge adjustment up in less than an hour.  Presumably the sudden skyrocketing of Bitcoin Cash difficulty will cause lots of hashpower to move back to Bitcoin, speeding it back up without having to wait for the difficulty to adjust.

You can see the time until next adjustment of both here:

The way nicehash works is you get paid for the hashing power you provide. Your hash power is sold on a marketplace, where people bid on it with bitcoin. So you're paid out in bitcoin, but you're not providing any hash power to the bitcoin network.

"Here is my take on the current problem with BCH/BTC.

Bitmain make a large proportion of all the mining hardware. It's in their interest to extract as much money out of miners as possible. Tragedy of the commons means that miners are in a perpetual race to own the fastest hardware possible and this keeps them coming back. 

In order to make most profit from mining hardware, mining has to be at the extreme upper limit of being just barely profitable, so that hardware prices can be kept up. i.e. miners have to mine continuously at a high price in order to cover their electricity and hardware costs. This means gaming the system so that they mine only expensive blocks when the difficulty is comparatively low to their hardware capability. What to do when blocks are below cost price (e.g. after a difficulty bump)? They still have to pay off their hardware investment.

Find something else to mine. This is BCH. By switching from BTC to BCH and back, and judicious use of price manipulation and leverage on the alternate currency, mining pools can continue to make sufficient money by mining BCH when it's high and pushing BTC price down.

They probably can't mine BCH indefinitely since it doesn't have a viable ecosystem apart from pure speculation. Therefore they will probably have to switch back to BTC at some point, probably when the difficulty/price ratio is more attractive.

However this fluctuation in the block generation time caused by their gaming the system is damaging to BTC. Bitcoin core need to urgently consider ways of addressing it, either by finding a way to either reward loyal miners/punish defectors or by making changes to the difficulty adjustment in a way that doesn't itself create an alternative way of gaming the system by an adversary.";4;3;False;rtuck99;dppzq3a;Please take a moment to thank Slush.

"Miners are far from the only stakeholders in the ecosystem. Bitcoin core does not dictate terms but they are influential.

One of the weaknesses of BCH is that on the technical side, the development roadmap is totally opaque. At least BTC has the BIP process.

Just because a change requires people to upgrade their nodes or clients does not mean that a fork is inevitable. Ideally such a change would be in the interest of all stakeholders, including those miners like Slush who are not gaming the system. If it is not controversial there does not need to be a fork. 

Also, this is not a ""BCH problem"". It's a BTC problem. It doesn't matter what the alternative currency is, merely that BTC is vulnerable to this kind of adversarial strategy, and that the economics of mining are such that is little incentive for miners not to do it. 

It doesn't really hurt BCH, BCH is basically nothing without the current BTC ""crisis"". It's just another altcoin albeit one that happens to have a lot of pre-distributed coins. All the real-world action (i.e. non-speculative) is happening on BTC.";6;0;False;rtuck99;dpq528p;Please take a moment to thank Slush.

"It was. The only reason it was rejected was because the “Core” devs would have their power diluted with more stakeholders adding their input into Bitcoin’s direction. In the interest of keeping power they ran a campaign against it. Echo chambers gonna echo! 

“Supporters” will paint it to be about scaling and how 2mb blocks are too big for people with 56k internet and how hard drives are too small to support a blockchain that grows by 500gb a year. None of the reasons you’ll see make any sense. 

The only legitimate argument against it is the “what if we cant stop at 2mb” argument. Maybe 8mb actually is too much. But its widely known that 2mb wouldn’t have been an issue.

"I think sidechains would bring in the regulators.  The way Bitcoin works now, is transactions are just picked up and recorded on a ledger for a fee.  Miners are not actually handling the money otherwise regulators would have already stepped in and done more than just declare Bitcoin a commodity.  With sidechains, oth, each member or hub helping to facilitate transactions actually handles the money for a very short period of time.  Being money handlers is what brings on regulation like KYC/AML requirements.

It is true that only larger companies will be able to afford a node, but that doesn’t mean just miners.  Many medium sized and most large sized companies that handle large transaction volumes will likely acquire a node to facilitate their own transactions.  Smaller companies will transact through merchant providers.  I can see the potential for 100,000+ nodes.

Yes some entities profit a good deal, but Bitcoin was always supposed to be a capitalist system full of competition.  Competition is what makes our world great!  I think it takes close to $21 million to control 1% of all the Bitcoin hashpower in order to secure the network.  That’s a serious investment, so it’s not like these companies are just printing money like the fed...  they are taking big risks and competing.

Each full node contains the entire history of the block chain right?  I don’t think it’s practical to expect all users to download the entire chain to transact.

"Anyone who owned Bitcoin (BTC) at the time of the fork (August 1st) also became the owner of Bitcoin Cash, an alt-coin (BCH).  Nothing was converted.  One coin became two, like two alternate realities in a time travel story.  If you had your bitcoins on your computer you could access your BCH directly, they were in your wallet file but they were invisible unless you used a special program (and your Bitcoin are invisible to that program).

If you had your bitcoins on an exchange then your bitcoins weren't in your wallet, they were in the exchange's wallet.  You don't have a wallet on an exchange, you have an account.  So your BCH appeared in the exchange's wallet.  You are probably legally entitled to them, but there is no way to get access to them unless to them unless the exchange puts in the effort to add support for the new alt-coin.

Coinbase said that they weren't going to support BCH but then people started suing them, so they announced that they would give access by January 1st.
