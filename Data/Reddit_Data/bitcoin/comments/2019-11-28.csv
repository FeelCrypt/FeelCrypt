"Many ask why Bitcoin has value, but really they are asking why is it worth $X amount. Even predictable profit producing companies have people disagree with how much they are worth, but asking why Bitcoin is worth anything at all is pointless. Even toe nail clippings have value, even if just for weight and not the miniscule amount of gold. That infintisemally small bit of value is just not enough to be worth a fraction of a fraction of anyone's time.

**Bitcoin has some level of value** because it allows immutable and verifiable transfer of value that is ""settled"" faster than traditional banking, all on a decentralized payment network with effectively 100% uptime. There are no charge backs, and paying someone once does not allow them to charge you again, as is the case with credit cards. Furthermore, the inflation rate is reasonable and safe from government control, with a known total issuance. It also has value because at least one idiot (myself included) thinks it's cool, but most care about the former argument.

Even when fees are high and transactions are slower due to congestion, the advantages remain for large transfers of value, providing a base value for the network. Eventually, second layer solutions will help alleviate the temporary spikes in network congestion, or maybe they won't. Either way, there is *some* value in the network, even if that value eventually only amounts to $1 per coin.

/u/cheeseburger- I hope the above somewhat answers your question.";5;1;False;Vagrant_Charlatan;f8wz9az;Giving Advice about Bitcoin at Thanksgiving;e2icxt;https://i.redd.it/2z6w16j299141.jpg

"Nicely explained.  

Sadly, and not your fault, if any of us went to my sister's house tomorrow and proclaimed, in response to her saying, ""what gives Bitcoin any value,"" that ""Bitcoin has some level of value because it allows immutable and verifiable transfer of value that settles faster than traditional banking, all on a decentralized payment network ..."" you're just going to trigger her insecurities, piss her off, and get her started screaming and yelling until she storms off and slams a door behind her ... at which point her husband mutters, ""see what I have to put up with?""  And then we'd all laugh, and then my sister would come back out, over pronouncing one syllable per angry footstep of something unintelligible as she heads into the kitchen and comes out with a big, sharp knife to threaten your life.  

Don't worry, if she stabs you she'll probably stick the knife into something hard, like your upper arm, or a shoulder blade, or your skull.  

I'm not making this up.

Remember, it's not your fault, either.  And what you said is correct and everything, but just not appropriate for your ""target audience"".

For her, for example, it might be better to compare Bitcoin to ""valuable"" things she's already familiar with.  She says, ""what gives Bitcoin any value?""  I might say, ""Good question.  Remember those antique spoons your found at that estate sale?  You paid $30, but they turned out to be worth a lot more?  Right.  They were valuable because they are rare, and made of silver, and antique.  So, what makes silver valuable? What makes gold valuable?  It turns out that the same things that make gold valuable also make Bitcoin valuable, but Bitcoin has a few cool things that make it even better than gold!  It's like gold you can send across the Internet.""

"Fair enough, but your sister isn't really my target audience. Sadly the majority of people have almost no investments. Rich and/or highly educated people hold the majority of the wealth that needs to move into Bitcoin. The Reddit demographic overlaps well with that group, just slants younger. If you convince the holders of wealth, they convince everyone else. Your average Jane or Joe doesn't have much to put into Bitcoin and often can't/shouldn't take the risk anyway. They'll change their mind when they see it become more mainstream.

I work in the financial sector, so telling coworkers it's digital gold just makes them go ""yeah, but gold is stupid too"" (and they're right). The above detail makes more sense to them as the industrial and commercial applications of a highly reliable and cheap transfer/store of value become more apparent. Even then, it's a tough sell as it's not stable yet.

For the average person, I'd use your example of digital gold with programmable features. Essentially, gold that can be easily teleported anywhere and converted into any currency, with simple storage on a smartphone or piece of paper. Though smartphone storage is not advised much here.";2;1;False;Vagrant_Charlatan;f8x4nzx;Giving Advice about Bitcoin at Thanksgiving;e2icxt;https://i.redd.it/2z6w16j299141.jpg

Nobody but us weirdos questions the current system. Its not time to exit, there is no infrastructure to spend crypto, unless you want to live on amazon gift cards. Bitcoin lost more value in 2018 than stocks did in 2008 (!!), and is not really a safe haven asset. The only reason for a normal person to get in to Bitcoin is Moon/Lambo, and you better have them lock the keys away somewhere, or they will panic sell and get rekt.
