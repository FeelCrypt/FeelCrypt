"**Foucault's Pendulum**

Foucault's Pendulum (original title: Il pendolo di Foucault [il ˈpɛndolo di fuˈko]) is a novel by Italian writer and philosopher Umberto Eco. It was first published in 1988, and an English translation by William Weaver appeared a year later.

Foucault's Pendulum is divided into ten segments represented by the ten Sefiroth. The satirical novel is full of esoteric references to Kabbalah, alchemy, and conspiracy theory—so many that critic and novelist Anthony Burgess suggested that it needed an index.

"> but something as deflationary as bitcoin

Bitcoin isn't significantly deflationary.  In fact, right now it's *inflating* at a rate of 12.5 BTC every (approx) 10 minutes.

Once all coins are mined, it neither inflates or deflates naturally.  It will artificially deflate through lost coins.

Right now, the adoption is outweighing the inflation (quite significantly), which is why it looks deflationary.

Secondly, I'd argue that the argument for inflation is stupid.  All it does is encourage people to use other stores of value.  It doesn't encourage spending.  People will spend **any** currency (whether inflationary, deflationary, or stable) on things that they want/need.

Those with a good understanding of the fact that their money will be worth less by holding on to it for a long time but nevertheless don't have anything they particularly want to spend it on right now will invest in other stores of value such as real estate, precious metals, and so on.

Most people however don't actually think this way and instead keep their (small, but not insignificant when summed across all individuals) wealth in inflationary currencies, effectively crippling the lower end of the economy in favour of the higher (who are generally more educated/assisted on financial management).";1;0;False;dalebewan;dr2qxnh;I made a decision tree for everyone panic selling.;7irgtw;http://i.magaimg.net/img/22kk.jpg

I think the success/fail question being asked is whether Bitcoin can displace fiat currency and become used for purchasing and payments in a mainstream way. I don't think he literally means it should not be an option to sell it, but that it should not be something one would want to do.

No one seems to be denying the points you are making there, but if BTC is still traded like now in 2040 then it's not a good sign for its purpose having been achieved. ";1;0;False;brainburger;dr2c37w;I made a decision tree for everyone panic selling.;7irgtw;http://i.magaimg.net/img/22kk.jpg

And if by 2140 all bitcoins are mined and people stop mining, who will maintain the network? Can bitcoin exist without miners? Will some government take up all the nodes and thus assume control? Will they someohw introduce new bitcoins to mine, thus effectively printing money and doing the thing so many bitcoin enthusiasts hate about fiat?

Sure, it's a currency, but it's a pretty crappy currency right now due to all the speculation and volatility. As hobskhan mentioned it's not very liquid - it's not like I can easily go to my grocery store and buy some food with Bitcoin.

"This is not quite accurate.

[Deuteronomy 23:19] forbids Israelite's from charging each other interest.

The Church interpreted this to mean also for Christians that they ought not to charge each other interest either. In medieval Europe where the Church basically dictated moral and occasionally legal codes, this meant that Christian couldn't lend to Christians at interest. But since Jews weren't considered 'countrymen' they were excluded from this prohibition and were allowed to lend at interest to Christians.

This is actually the origin of the 'Jews are greedy' stereotype.

"True, you are absolutely correct. To avoid the religious ban on interest, there might have to be an origination fee, or some other quid pro quo to motivate the lender in the first place. Perhaps it would be a share in the profits of a venture. It does boil down to interest defacto. 

Expected deflation would perhaps allow for a lower real rate of interest, but that is perhaps offset by the fact that you cannot loan imaginary money and so the losses are always realized fully.

"Not exactly true. If you had a halal loan for your business - say20k - then the 'fee' would be an agreed percentage of profit. 

So if you made 1$M then you'd pay X%. If you made $2 you'd pay the same X%. If you lost money and went bust you'd pay the loan plus some agreed fee. 

Seems fairer than a fixed percentage on the sum regardless of success of failure. The idea is the the lender shares in your success/failure rather than exploits you regardless of either turnout as is now in the West.

That's where we get stereotypes of Jews and money from. Back in medieval Europe Christians were basically banned from loaning money, so Jews would do the loaning as they believed in the same god, but couldn't be told that they couldn't loan by the church.

And for the record, you can do trade near Christians.

">OK - so how is it racist to be suspicious a religion that spans of 1.6 billion people across all races?

It's not but there is a strong correlation between racism and Islamophobia. 

Most normal people are rightly condemning of Islamism and scum like Daesh. But most normal people also don't see these maniacs as equalling to Islam. 

Those that DO think that Daesh are synonymous with Islam are uneducated on the matter and highly likely to be uneducated on other matters such as race and gender too. 

So you could say that most sane people realise that 1.6 Billion Muslims aren't a threat because if they were we'd all be dead by now - and the irrational ones who see all these 1.6 as a threat are not racist to do so.

But they very likely ARE racist for other reasons. ";1;1;False;segovius;dr3lonz;Muslim clerics just declared that owning bitcoin was compatible with Islam.

"Technically correct.  I should have said Temple but to be fair a temple is/was just a generic name for a religious building and when we take into account that Jesus referred to the place where the money changers were doing business ""my Father's house"" one must assume that it must have been some sort of place of worship of who Jesus considered his Father (the christian God?).   

At any rate... it wasnt the trade they were engaged with specifically... it was the location they chose to conduct business which pissed the Son 'O' God off sooo much :) 

(I'm Pastor's Son... I sometimes payed a little attention... but its still my own interpretation of how that shizz went down)



    ""And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves, And said unto them, It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves.""

Personally I think it's because they're pussies and not like the old Nazis they so much admire - they can't stand up and say ""I'm a racist suck it up byatch"".... they have to obfuscate. 

And because - as you so germanely point out - Muslims are not a race then it's a great place to transfer all the hate and not have to nail the racist colours to the mast. 

And of course it's allowed and even encouraged to hate Islam so it's win-win.

"The issue of Bitcoin being Halal or Haram is something the Muslim community need to figure out fast. Two clerics recently declared it Haram (forbidden), they are Assem Al Hakeem and Shaykh Sulayman ar-Ruahyli, both videos are on YouTube. From their statements it seems they don't see the value of Bitcoin or have enough knowledge of the Tech or use and are simply saying that investing in bitcoin is a gamble on something that is not tangible, they actually say this for all cryptos nor just Bitcoin.

But investing into anything blindly is a gamble, you have to do your due diligence, it seems some clerics are declaring it Haram just because they don't understand it. The Muslim community needs to figure this out, because of cryptos have the impact on the world that we know they will, Muslims will be playing catch up.

But it's good to see that there is some discussions now and once it's realised that it's not just 'magic internet money' or something that 'someone can turn off with a flick of the switch' clerics will see that cryptos and Bitcoin are actually more Halal than the regular banking system.";0;1;False;macdoos86;dr3kp30;Muslim clerics just declared that owning bitcoin was compatible with Islam.

Dear Br. Riaz
Assalamu Alaykum wa Rahmatu Allahi wa Barakatuh
I believe that any claimed currency cannot be recognized unless it is adopted by a formal
government. Without being a currency of a country (not a phony government) any such
currency cannot be recognized in Shari’ah. it you deal with bitcoin not as a currency it is then
merely illusion and claim.

"Is charging interest on money even needed in a bitcoin economy?

Given two assumptions:

* The economy is growing and productivity increasing
* The growth is reflected in steady deflation of bitcoin prices (2%-4% per year)

Then any loan denominated in bitcoin would have ""interest"" baked in, without increasing the quantity of satoshi owed or charging any overt interest rates, the real cost to replace the borrowed bitcoin would naturally increase over time.

Edit ~ the answer is yes; even with deflation there is still a need for interest and loans";22;5;False;rinko001;dr38shn;Muslim clerics just declared that owning bitcoin was compatible with Islam.

"That Gulf residents are pumping lots of money into BTC is great, but if I may, your title is a bit misleading.  Islam has 5 major schools of thought (Hanafi/Shafi'i/Maliki/Ja'fari/Hanbali, ranked by size of following population - not including some minor ones accounting for the other <1%) whose scholars are heeded for these matters, and already Turkey's Religious Ministry (Diyanet, which is largely Hanafi) actually forbade BTC transactions.  The links you post are just of some random Arab newspaper and a dude in Kuwait; it's not like the scholars gathered around their table, nodded their heads and stamped some papers for the masses to follow. 

As I'm no scholar, I won't comment on whether it is halal or not, but I don't see a reason why BTC as a store of value, even if highly volatile, violates the shari'ah.  God knows best.

"You got some of it right, some of it completely wrong I'm afraid. I come from a quant background, and to me trading has always been about exploiting temporary market inefficiencies (usually referred to as 'anomalies' in literature), be it crypto or whatever other market. These usually stem, but are not limited to, irrational market participants as documented by behavioral finance and related fields.

Modern trading is rarely limited to forecasting alone and is much more about building robust portfolio strategies, which  involves managing risk, diversification (meaning diversification of models/algorithms not assets), re-balancing, hedging, etc. Fundamentally all of it can be boiled down to decision making under regimes of uncertainty. 

A big part of it is information and every additional bit, once proper denoising procedures have been accounted for, can give you an edge. This is why it is rather naive to dismiss bull vs. bear markets. For example, volumes have been dedicated to modelling hidden states with various Bayesian methods (hidden markov models, mixture models, etc) to either filter or forecast regimes. Being aware of current regime conditions can be crucial to certain strategies, for example momentum or mean reversion ones.

On the topic of TA, its not that it doesn't work (although nobody appears to be able to prove or disprove that), its rather about how it is applied. Again, if you take a known market anomaly like momentum, there are certainly over a 100 TA indicators that can probably either forecast or filter momentum. However, TA - or rather TA practitioners - suffers from reliance on subjective interpretation, 100s of ad-hoc implementations, overall specificity when it comes to parameter selection and is overall rather remote from what you would call ""math inspired trading"". 

To illustrate this, and sticking to the momentum example, a quantitative strategy (algorithmically or manually traded) would first start out with various assumptions. Momentum certainly exists, but do we target cross-sectional or time series momentum. If its the latter, what is the best lookback period for smoothing our price series? We could compute the hurst exponent on historic data to get a good estimate. Maybe we want a dynamically adjustable window/algorithm,  then an 'on-the-fly' approximator like the Kalman filter will do quite well. When do we trade? How do we manage risk? Do we want to forecast volatility with a GARCH or similar models or do we just want to look at historic volatility to estimate current levels. Which coins are more prone to momentum? Can we estimate this dynamically by computing serial correlation of the top 100 coins and then choosing the ones with the smallest p value? How do we backtest this strategy? Can we compare it to a benchmark? Are our backtest results statistically significant? And so on.

With TA I feel like its always just an ad-hoc, rule of thumb, kind of approach... Admittedly I'm not TA guy but thats just  what I've encountered so far, no disrespect intended of course, if it makes you money its all good.

"For your 3rd point,

I highly disagree with what you said. Understanding those patterns and different moving averages and indicators helped me make a lot of my money. 

You may not be as good at reading the patterns/indicators, but I for one through experience can vouch that I have made some amazing plays when I see a squeeze coming up when the bollinger bands are tight and the volatility has come to a stand still. Then within the next few minutes or maybe an hour when volatility picks up, it is sky rocketing. You also see how much a coin/stock is overbought/oversold, and when it will go in an upward trend or a downward trend.

Not only that, but you factor in other things such as when the other side of the world is awake and trading, or when there is news/rumours, these other factors play a huge part in knowing when to use the indicators or not.

And finally....What do you think the bot programs use when they are programmed to play the market? You think they are just programmed knowing how to buy stuff on the whim?

"jesus this isn't really the list i was expecting 

My list 

1. Buy on gdax not coinbase
Move money via bank avoid lot of fees 

2. If you are going to trade don't go moving btc around willy nilly it takes a long time and costs a lot in fees 

3. Enable two factor everywhere - make sure to back up all seed (inc for seed for 2 factor!) print them out to paper back up for max security 

4. always hold eth ltc and some btc 

5. if you have to move money between exchanges use ltc or eth as a transport coin - check network congestion before moving your coins

6. learn how to triple check coin address visually match the first 4 and last 4 digits  - screenshot that bastard to ensure you dont fuk up and for peace of mind for the time your coins are slow to show 

7. be aware coinbase and even some wallets can change coin receive addresses and really confuse you

8. if using a btc wallet like electrum you dont have to pay the auto set fee  - you can elect a cheaper fee although your transaction could take longer - you can speed up btc sends via antpool.com/prioritisetransaction (needs a free signup)

9. some desktop wallets will sync the entire blockchain of the coin beware of this as it can take ages  - usually you can downlaod a zip file containing transactions to a certain date - if you use a lite or web wallet you can bypass this  

10. using bittrex you can comfortably see upcoming buy and sell orders in green and red - always have a look at this before buying 

11. if you've doubled the value of your coin it is a safe time to sell chances are you can buy back in lower

"I understand. The studies assess if people are making money by using a large sample size of hundreds of thousands of investors. Your sample size is probably like, ""oh I know 10 people who made money."" 


The issue is you have not convinced me that you will make more money using TA than if you didn't. If you tell me you are up since 5 years ago, that tells me nothing. All that matters is on the day you die, will you have made more money doing TA or not? The reason you need to take a long-term approach is I don't know if you profited in the last 5 years because of TA or because you are lucky. For all I know, it is just luck and you will have a losing streak for the next 5 years. 

Your counter is that, ""if this didn't work (aka if you didnt make more money in your lifetime using TA than not), then smart people wouldn't use it."" My counter is, ""yes they would, because all humans are stupid and irrational, and make stupid decisions."" You have not responded to this criticism. You just avoid it by repeating the same thing.

Yes. 5years hodl sounds correct to make a millionaire. The only difference for old and new hodler is the initial investment. 5 years ago it only need a couple of grands to become a million today.

"> I've been having difficulty trying to get actual technical information.

You mustn't be very technical then hey ;-) /s

Jokes aside. There's a lot of information about it, even just trudging through core and associated projects on github provides immense amounts of information on the underlying technology these days.

And as for pandering to a non-technical audience. This is exactly the way it should be. How else is it going to be safe and practical to use for everyone?

You are confusing quant trading with TA. While quants might use some TA indicators (although from my experience rarely if ever) in their models, quantitative trading goes miles and miles beyond what your regular TA shop would do. You mention Renaissance and Jane Street, one known for James Simons of Chern–Simons form fame the other for producing absolutely outstanding oCaml fintech tool respectively. Very, very far removed from choosing a few oscillators and relying on MA crossover techniques. ;16;1;False;noxlund;dr2ckq3;10 things I wish someone had told me when I was learning to trade crypto;7iug4i;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7iug4i/10_things_i_wish_someone_had_told_me_when_i_was/
"No, I'm saying that it matters for trading, not saying it will work for valuation. I don't even know if its possible to reliably estimate the ""actual"" value of a crypto, and would not recommend TA for that. But TA (in terms of quantitative approaches, not some basic math you did in an excel spreadsheet) really is the holy grail for *trading* because trading, by my definition at least, is not about actual value at all, it's about volatility.

BTW: I'm not an amateur trader, I worked on quantitative trading, I just was less on the actual trading side of things and more on the software / math side of things.

Edit: OK I guess I was assuming that people meant quantitative approaches by TA. Don't just do anything ""technical"" and expect that to work.

"No, every major financial institution has a department, I'm saying that the most successful financial institutions *are precisely* the ones that rely the most on / have the best technical analysis. Look up the funds I mentioned. I'm not going to explain to you the intricacies of quantitative trading and how it works, you can look it up if curious. 

And I didn't think I would need to spell this out, but the features that make things like stocks and commodities attractive to trade with (bid-ask spreads and short-term volatility) are exactly what make Bitcoin attractive to trade with, and therefore some of the same basic principles you can apply to stocks and commodities trading can also be applied to Bitcoin.

Finally, I get the impression you don't understand TA in the context of trading. You are predicting human behavior by modeling it over the short term. You're not modeling things like ""what will the price of bitcoin be in two years?"", because you're right, that's really hard. You're instead looking at things like ""given this volatility over this interval, how confident am I that this new trading price is above or below a more locally stable price?"" which directly ties into human behavior.";4;0;False;casa_vostra;dr25p6c;10 things I wish someone had told me when I was learning to trade crypto;7iug4i;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7iug4i/10_things_i_wish_someone_had_told_me_when_i_was/

"All I'll say is this: most ""TA"" is bullshit not backed up by real, rigorous math. You could learn some of these with little technical knowledge and make money off them, just like you can make money from trading with no TA whatsoever. The ones that actually work will require a high level of math knowledge and the ability to compute things efficiently; the bullshit ones are easy but I doubt you'll make money from them over the long run.

I'm not that knowledgable about trading crypto. But trading is trading regardless of the underlying item. 

Honestly I don't understand why anybody would bother ""trading"" without tons of mathematical analysis. You're better off looking at more long term investment, not trading.

I think it's a bad idea to use them interchangeably.

It is a very valid argument. Amateur traders shouldn’t be trading anything less than the daily chart as the moves occur much faster.

"For someone that doesn't have a CS,Math,or Physics background, is there any sense trying to learn TA as a beginning first year trader looking trade crypto?  From what I understand, TA (from what I know in stocks) is mainly used by day and swing traders correct?   Also, you seem fairly knowledgeable and I'm a bit naive at how trading in general functions at these crypto exchanges.  

When crypto trading, I'm assuming traders are generally trying to predict where the market is going to be at a given point in time by using whatever TA tools they have at their disposal (MACD, Candlestick patterns, Elliot Waves,etc)  Not that I would day trade crypto , but just to understand how these markets work, is a beginning trader going to be at a severe disadvantage simply because he/she will be trading amongst of traders that are more experienced in TA trading?

I am more optimistic on TA than this article - I think if you combine 2 or more indicators together that is safer than using only 1.

"> Instead of reading news nonstop, better educate yourself  

Can we please make this as #1 Rule not only for Bitcoin, but for everything that has to do with media? So we stop becoming more and more stupid and hateful on this planet, screaming ""terrorist!!"" at a Spanish couple and attacking with a bat (yes, that indeed happened).  

.  

\#6 is harcore.. The only time I would do this if I could buy NOW a timemachine and go back, because I know that Bitcoin will become at least ~20k $ rates one day. But since we don't have this technology now, doing this is extremly ~~stupid~~ irresponsible. (\*edit\*: wait.. maybe this guy has a timemachine!!)    

.  

\#8 To prevent this thinking I would give you all the tip to go into the mindset that.. at the exact same time where you bought Bitcoins, no matter how much, the exact price you paid is actually a LOSS for you. Yes, think about you already lost the money. You don't own it anymore. You own Bitcoins, but not the money. Yes, we give Bitcoins a value and it can be sold, but UNTIL we didn't successfully sold it and your bankaccount says ""You got xx.xx$ +"", the amount you have is 0$ and you lost the costs for that Bitcoin.  

This way there is no loosing. You have nothing to lose. Yes, the Bitcoin value can drop, who cares? You will sell that in 2 years. If it becomes 20$/Bitcoin again then you will sell it for 20$/BTC. And at this stage you will actually have a winning! Yes, you had nothing and just won something!  


The moment I decided to invest money into BTC, I also accepted that I probally never ever will see that money again. Yes, I hope to become wealthy, but I still know that there is this little chance.. the little, tiny, itsi bitsi percent that there could happen anything unforseen like in Half Life 2 with Dr.Prof. .. wait, I shouldn't spoiler.  

So knowing that there is always a chance in anything I do that it could go in the wrong direction in life.. well, what should I do? I only can accept it and try preventing it as much as I can.  

I can't do much at BTC's, because I have no influence about them. But I have influence about the amount of money I ""invest"" in them. It's the amount that I could live to lose without diving into financial problems. I really wanted to buy for 1000€'s more, but that would be a high financial risk for me (maybe any goverment wants money? Maybe something happens and I need that money? One time I got a letter from health insurance and they wanted 1400€ from me for the past month.. have fun paying that without savings that I luckly had made!), so I didn't bought more.

"While it's true that a currency needn't _necessarily_ be ""backed"" by something to be an effective means of exchange, virtually everything else you've said is false, or obvious pandering to the prevailing socioeconomic attitudes prevalent in this sub.

First, let's dispel the notion that US dollars aren't backed by anything. US Dollars have an important quality that makes them useful to an individual, regardless of whether other individuals want them: they can be used to pay down US citizens' tax obligations. This is no trivial thing. Read about Chartalism for more information.

>A currency, the manifestation of money, is valuable when it does a good job of transferring the aforementioned data by being:
1) easy to use and understand by everyone
2) tamperproof such that it resists corruption of the original signal
3) neglegible in overhead costs

You're listing this out like it's out of a textbook or something, but it's just 3 random points you picked out of the air that are heavily influenced by the current subject matter of Bitcoin. The average economist, when asked about money, is not going to mention that it should be ""easy to understand by everyone"", tamperproof, or low in transaction overhead. They're going to talk about the usual trifecta:
1) A medium of exchange
2) A store of value
3) A standard of value

Hilariously, even though you've arbitrarily chosen the metric we're using to measure the worth of a currency, Bitcoin still utterly fails to meet all 6 of these points. Let's go through them, starting with yours:

1. Easy to use and understand by everyone - Why would you even set yourself up for this? ""What is Bitcoin"" ""how does Bitcoin work"" ""How do I get a bitcoin"" These are some of the most asked questions on the internet because nobody can grok Bitcoin on the first try, and even when they do, it's not clear to them how they can ""buy in"". 
2. Tamperproof such that it resists corruption of the original signal - While at first bluff this is true, tamperproof is really just one element of a larger desire that malicious third parties can't change the debt record in their favor. From a purely technical standpoint Bitcoin should be resistant to this, but in practice, the number of coins lost to negligent storage, Wallet exploits, etc. puts this point squarely against BTC. I am much, MUCH less concerned that my US bank account will disappear due to some technical trapdoor, or compromised because somebody hacked into the computer systems at my credit union.
3. Negligible in overhead costs - Bitcoin is ludicrously expensive to transact in, and circumventing this via, e.g. the Lightning network, necessarily involves tradeoffs against other technical qualities that you will doubtless be counting for Bitcoin elsewhere.
4. Medium of exchange - worthless. Nobody wants to buy pizzas with Bitcoin, because it is by and large considered some kind of investment. I love the irony that people don't want to spend their bitcoin to buy things because they're convinced that it's so incredibly useful to buy things - so much so that it will one day net them millions of... dollars? No wait, not that!
5. It is completely untrustworthy as a store of value - putting money into Bitcoin is not safe. This entire sub has ""invest responsibly"" posts slathered all over it because even the most foolhardy zealots realize that that saying you should save your life's earnings in Bitcoin is a terrible idea.  If I had $20 in a bank account in 2008, when I took it out today, it would only be worth 87% of what it was then. Inflation does hurt you over long periods of time, but this was a smooth, monotonic decay. It's the kind of value you can quite literally bank on decades in advance. Bitcoin has no such assurances. The value of your life savings denominated in Bitcoin changes significantly every day.
6. A standard of value - The fact that people's biggest concern is how many dollars one can buy with their Bitcoin tells you everything you need to know. Nobody denominates values in Bitcoin - it would be completely useless. If I told you this car was worth 1 BTC, that means two different things on Monday vs. Friday. If I tell you it's worth $15000, you understand.

>It protects signal integrity to a degree that no other currency type can.

This is meaningless. 

>This is why cryptocurrency is so valuable, and why it will continue to soar

Oh, you mean soar up and down like a tech stock after an IPO? Making it completely untrustworthy as a store of value, and unusable as a medium of exchange? Regardless, even if it _was_ monotonically rising in value (it's not, not even close), why would this be a good thing? If you want to live in a world where all goods and services are completely denominated in Bitcoin, it doesn't matter what Bitcoin is ""worth"" in US dollars at any point in that cycle. The measure of Bitcoin's usefulness starts and ends with what types of things can be bought with it. It doesn't matter if a pair of shoes costs 1 BTC or .0000001 BTC if, all other things being equal, your salary and pension and taxes are measured in BTC. It's just a scale-factor. If you think the value of Bitcoin, denominated in US dollars, soaring into the stratosphere is a good thing, then you've patently revealed your true motivation, which is for the in-crowd to get rich. This is deliciously ironic given:

>they betray their ignorance, their illiteracy and their complete blindness to the revolution that's happening right under their feet and which will, in time, bring down the corrupt power structures of our world to create a freer, fairer society for all of us.

And so we see what you'd really like to see happen: destroy the riches of the current superwealthy and replace them with a different group that you like more - Bitcoin early adopters.



Bitcoin is a fascinating development, and it blazed an important first trail in the modernization of money and commerce, but from a technical standpoint it is totally inadequate to serve as the currency of the internet, or the currency of the world. Transaction fees, energy usage due to mining, validation waits, Wallet protection, and exchange with existing monetary infrastructure - all of these things are lacking in fundamental, unfixable ways. The world needs something that has a lot in common with Bitcoin, but it also needs to have a lot of things that are quite different. Sitting around and telling each other that the establishment just ""Doesn't get us, man"" is fucking delusional. There are people that don't understand cryptocurrency, but this is not the only or even the main reason that Bitcoin falls into criticism. It is being criticized because it has real, legitimate, unsustainable, deal-breaker problems. When you write this kind of BS that 'the establishment is just trying to protect the status quo', you sound like a lunatic conspiracy theorist who things that GM knows how to make cars run on water but won't tell us because of the oil cartel. It just doesn't make any fucking sense. If Bitcoin was a digital pantheon of economic exchange that was going to usher in the modern era of banking, then you know who would be all over that shit? BANKS. It's not a cabal of evil capitalists trying to crush the revolution. It's a few uninformed people, and a bunch of people who have genuine grievances based on their understanding of monetary policy and finance. Maybe in some cases they're too stuck in their old ways of thinking, but anybody assuming that finance and banking professionals have no wisdom to impart here is gravely mistaken.

The shorthand for all of this is to ask yourself: if you could wake up tomorrow to a world that had replaced all existing monetary infrastructure, would you REALLY want to? Millions of truck drivers with unsecured wallets, policeman's pensions sitting on the blockchain, Starbucks waiting 5 minutes to confirm that your $5 coffee (+ $5 settlement fee) can be handed over? 3 transactions per second for the entire world?

"The problem is it isn't black or white and my investment was a bit of a gamble(as are all investments). I made the decision because I realized a few things (especially after being part of the first few bubbles). First off a huge amount of people in the space don't understand the proposition value of the technology(which does have a value but I don't believe it to be a worldwide currency). Due to the fact that it does have properties similar to digital gold and that it's not easy to understand it's very prone to speculative bubbles which are fun when they go up and brutal when they come crashing down so it's fairly easy to capitalize on these cycles once you pick up on these cycles. 

A lot of the black/grey market (or just people wanting to evade tax) will use bitcoin because of it's properties that will increase it's value. It appeals to certain groups with certain ideologies worldwide and the community itself is a driver in the price (HODL meme). Everyone invested suddenly becomes so much more susceptible to thinking that it 100% is going to succeed because they put money in it so it kind of act like a feed back loop and you get a huge amount of confirmation bias in the community. All these contribute to price increase. It has nothing to do with the technology (which is a work of art) as much as it does with human psychology.

I've been arguing the deflation argument for a while in this community and one single person has given me a paper about why deflation isn't always bad, the paper is about 60 pages long and I haven't had a lot of time to go through yet so I'll hold off that criticism but I don't believe that inflation is necessarily a bad thing. I think a lot of people are suffering from lack of wage growth which is a bigger issue than inflation itself. TBH it's been years since I've read into any Austrian economics and I have many issues with the current system but I really don't think the answer is to throw away what we know and start it from scratch like many in this sub do. For example I don't believe taxes are theft but I do agree that a lot of taxes are misspent and the ability to withhold the tax money would do a lot to ensure sound monetary policy and fair taxation(you'll also notice that this point of view varies a lot between Americans and Europeans). I don't see bitcoin as a solution as such but it's a very interesting counterbalance to many of the issues that we face today.

"> If everyone would only use Bitcoin and there was no USD as in the hypothesis above, steel's price would also increase

That's the opposite of how deflation works. Deflation is a decrease in prices relative to the value of money.

Really its hard to take bitcoin seriously when its advocates make this kind of mistake.

>And if everyone would have Bitcoin, an equilibrium woulb be reached.

The supply of bitcoin is hard-coded to decrease over time until it hits 0, except even before supply rate hits 0, the total number of available bitcoins will start decreasing because they will be lost faster than they are produced.

This makes equilibrium impossible to achieve. In order for the value of a currency to stay constant it needs to scale with the amount of wealth in the economy.

>Again, a loaf of bread costing twice as much as it did say 5 years ago in an inflationary system is the same as it costing half as much in BTC in a few years time in a deflationary system.

uhhh... no its not the same.

In one system, if you wait 5 years you need to spend twice as much currency to get the same amount of goods. In the other, if you wait 5 years you need to spend half as much.

This is the key problem with deflation is that it discourages trade and encourages hoarding, but money is only useful if it is used to facilitate trade. It generates no value when it is hoarded.

"I mean people could get together and decide to peg the supply of bitcoin to the growth of the world economy, but that would require A) a huge revision in the protocol which would be difficult to get everyone to agree on and B) everyone involved in bitcoin would have to vote against their own financial interests for the good of other people.

If you own bitcoin your financial interest is to increase the price of bitcoin as much as possible. There's no reason you would care if its a viable currency or not when your reason for getting in was making money (hence the popularity of the ""bitcoin was never meant to be a currency, its a store of value, other coins will be currency"" meme).

It's much more likely innovation will come from a separate coin/technology which doesn't have vested interest in increasing price at all costs.

Satoshi was smart enough to realize that currency needed a network effect, and so you needed some sort of incentive for people to give a fuck about bitcoin before you could use it as currency. Unfortunately he did not have a good plan for what would happen after people started adopting bitcoin. All the incentives are focused on growing bitcoin as fast as possible rather than on ensuring it becomes a useful widely accepted currency. Capping bitcoins was a great way of making sure people would think its valuable in the short term but guaranteed that it would become worthless in the long term.

There's also the underlying problem of how you decentrally revise protocol without allowing perverse incentives to take over. Any government not run by incompetent dictators have a reason not to abuse their currency, because government gets its money from tax, and if you destroy the currency you destroy the economy, and the economy is where you get taxes from.

Bitcoin really needed a system where people would be rewarded by increasing the use of the currency, not just increasing the price. Miners make far more from bitcoin increasing in price than they do off fees, or could ever realistically make off fees, so they have no incentive to reform.";3;0;False;suninabox;dr3k52n;"Bitcoin exposes the massive economic illiteracy of financial journalism; arm yourselves with knowledge.";7iyej5;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7iyej5/bitcoin_exposes_the_massive_economic_illiteracy/

"Yes, the value of 1 bitcoin will adjust to demand. 21 Million coins or 1 coin is arbitrary.  The network can function perfectly fine with any amount of BTC.  If 4% of coins are lost per year long term the value of the remaining coins will grow 4% given everything else remains constant.

"99% of fiat currencies, ever created, have collapsed. That's just a historical fact. Fiat, meaning, mandated by government ""fiat"" only with no precious metal or commodity backing.

And yes. The globe has been operating under a fiat monetary system for ONLY 46 years. We're living in a completely experimental system. Literally never seen before in history. USD was backed by gold prior to 1971 while most world currencies were backed by the USD. This was called the Breton Woods system. Prior to that, many world currencies were, themselves, backed by gold. Being backed by gold is an important factor for a currency. It prevents excessive currency creation. Remember when I said 99% of fiat currencies have collapsed? Yea... mostly because of excessive currency creation...

">With the value of your saved labor going up

Who will pay for your labour when there's no investment?

>If mortgages didn't exist homes would approach the cost of construction

What is the cost of construction? How much is a builder's wage? What about risk of losses?

>Homes would be 80-90% less in price compared to today

Why? Less investment means smaller workforce, means fewer houses built, and assuming demand doesn't crash through the floor and people continue to need housing, prices might actually become higher. Worse, the richest can buy homes out and rent seek, yet now they're even greater beneficiaries when they do so as their rent naturally becomes worth more.

"> You and your ilk

What's with this ""us vs. them"" mentality? You think I'd be talking up economics and bitcoin on Reddit if I was an investment banker? lol

I believe that economics is a social science. This is because, at its heart, it attempts to predict the behavior of large masses of people under specific, mathematically quantifiable circumstances. In light of this, comparing it to philosophy is very disingenuous.

I also don't think that mankind is on ""the edge of a cliff"" as you so eloquently put it. I am fairly certain that my dollars today will purchase roughly 2% less than they will next year, and then 2% less the year after that. This encourages me to invest my dollars in places where they will be productive, in order to increase my rate of return to beat inflation. I can use them to start a business, or buy stocks in growing companies or even just buying government bonds. In any case, this is only possible because the money supply can expand and contract in order to control the expansion/contraction of the economy.

"I don't need the concept of ""intrinsic value"".  The definition of proof-of-work of a money is ""a public understanding or proof about the work to get 1.0 unit of money"".  Not everything that exists has proof-of-work.  This is a rare property which contributes to store of value.  If you show me a modern art work, I am not sure it is a kid graffiti or something of painstaking artist work, therefore the modern art work has no proof-of-work property.

Also note that the physical unit for work and energy is the same, joule.  The concept is physical and universal irrelevant to subjective preference.  Just like law of energy conservation, money shall not be created from thin air.  Imposing the purchase power axiom of ""a same amount of money shall pay for boiling 100 gram water in a remote past and future"", you conclude money is isomorphic to energy.  Sound money does exist; anything with a constant proof-of-work and ""many other apparent physical properties we all wish about money"" is a sound money with which people won't be ""getting rich quick"" and lazy because of coin appreciation and won't get robbed (stolen wealth) because of coin depreciation by increasing coin volume.  If someday homosapiens contact E.T. for some transaction, something battery will be the money for the transaction.  By definition, the proof-of-work of one battery is  ideally the energy it contains and everyone can measure it objectively.  In famine out of power, this battery money can even help to feed or warm a person.  In case that there is constant energy inflow, the constant proof-of-work artifact needn't contain energy to be a sound money; it is then an ledger accounting system about energy to help social cooperation.";1;0;False;LucSr;dr2rvi8;"Bitcoin exposes the massive economic illiteracy of financial journalism; arm yourselves with knowledge.";7iyej5;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7iyej5/bitcoin_exposes_the_massive_economic_illiteracy/

"right, money begins of a thing of value (treasure...valuable because others want it) and later becomes a unit of exchange once the demand for the 'thing' has been fully expressed.

I'd say right now, the markets haven't existed to ""measure the global demand for bitcoin"", they are just emerging now to touch everyday people and that's when the value of Bitcoin hits a ""logical limit""....and then at that point it will work more like digital gold money.

it will hold some large price, and people will send chunks of it around without worry of 40% swings anymore.

"No idea how much they're worth, all my eggs are in the bitcoin basket for now, plus I can't buy any crypto other than BTC and ETH in my country anyway. Just thought that tangle-based cryptocurrencies in general seem promising, per the [white paper](https://iota.org/IOTA_Whitepaper.pdf): 

>In general, a tangle-based cryptocurrency works in the following way. Instead of the global blockchain, there is a DAG that we call the tangle. The transactions issued by nodes constitute the site set of the tangle graph, which is the ledger for storing transactions. The edge set of the tangle is obtained in the following way: when a new transaction arrives, it must approve two1 previous transactions. these approvals are represented by directed edges, as shown in Figure 12. If there is not a directed edge between transaction A and transaction B, but there is a directed path of length at least two from A to B, we say that A indirectly approves B. There is also the “genesis” transaction, which is approved either directly or indirectly by all other transactions (Figure 2). The genesis is described in the following way. In the beginning of the tangle, there was an address with a balance that contained all
of the tokens. The genesis transaction sent these tokens to several other “founder” addresses. Let us stress that all of the tokens were created in the genesis transaction. No tokens will be created in the future, and there will be no mining in the sense that miners receive monetary rewards “out of thin air”.

>The main idea of the tangle is the following: to issue a transaction, users must work to approve other transactions. Therefore, users who issue a transaction are contributing to the network’s security. It is assumed that the nodes check if the approved transactions are not conflicting. If a node finds that a transaction is in conflict with the tangle history, the node will not approve the conflicting transaction in either a direct or indirect manner. 

>As a transaction receives additional approvals, it is accepted by the system with a higher level of confidence. In other words, it will be difficult to make the system accept a double-spending transaction. It is important to observe that we do not impose any rules for choosing which transactions a node will approve. Instead, we argue that if a large number of nodes follow some “reference” rule, then for any fixed node it is better to stick to a rule of the same kind. This seems to be a reasonable assumption, especially in the context of IoT, where nodes are specialized chips with pre-installed firmware.";1;0;False;MoNastri;dr2ttdv;"Bitcoin exposes the massive economic illiteracy of financial journalism; arm yourselves with knowledge.";7iyej5;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7iyej5/bitcoin_exposes_the_massive_economic_illiteracy/

Define rich and tiny number. Definitely more than a tiny number of people are experiencing considerable gains in fiat currency. Speculation and price discovery, which will eventually lead to stabilization = price having been discoverd. Besides.. Bitcoin can even be ""something a tiny number of people are getting rich from specualting on"" AND a ""tool for the poor man"", not one OR the other. 

Regarding price discovery, speculation and getting rich from it.

">If bitcoin replaces fiat, the price of bitcoin has to go up massively to compensate

Only if you don't increase the supply to match the demand. If you increased supply to meet increased demand the price wouldn't go up at all. 

Supply of bitcoin is completely unresponsive to demand. The supply rate was 4x higher when there were only a few hundred people in the entire world using it. Now there are millions of people who want to trade bitcoin and the supply rate is 1/4 of what it was. In a few years it will be 1/8th of what it was. To keep pace with demand the supply rate would have had to have increased significantly. It hasn't which is why we're seeing skyrocketing prices.

Bitcoin is already at 1000%+ deflation a year. If any country was actually relying on bitcoin to function it would have collapsed already from such a ridiculously high level of deflation, and the level of deflation is a fraction of what will happen if you expect the supply rate to halve again while the demand rate doubles repeatedly in the years to come.

Thankfully no country is actually relying on bitcoin as a currency, its just a relatively low cap speculative investment.



>Right, you can't make a bubble that will grow forever and never burst, but what if bitcoin isn't a bubble?

What if it keeps going up 1000% a year forever? How could something increasing in value that fast not attract speculators? If its attracted speculators then its attracted people who bought in only to profit and will cash out the second it looks like they've made all the profit they're likely to. When those people cash out for good, the bubble will burst. Whatever you're left with will tell you the value of bitcoin without speculation.

"I'm well aware of what survivorship bias is, thank you.

Some others did as well, notably the Bezemer 12. I believe Krugman wrote an op-ed where he called out the housing crisis at some point in 2006 as well if I'm not mistaken. Calm down.

Massive fluctuations in a currency, whether up or down harm the currencies ability to function as a currency. Bitcoin used to be a currency but right now its an investment. You're not using your bitcoins for anything other than waiting on them to sell them at a higher price. There's no other currency in the world where that is the case. Slight variations in the value of a currency can be handled but the rate of increase that bitcoin has gone through removes its ability to function as a currency. Currency is a median of exchange for goods and services, who today is using their bitcoins to buy and sell goods?

Mises proposed that every monetary unit must first have been valued independently of its function as money (but not in an objective sens - no ""intrinsical"" value involved) before the use shifts progressively (it's a *regression* theorem only when you start from money) towards the monetary function.

It enables their communities access to funding without a bank as an intermediary. Let's say a village wants to build a well, or a sports hall, or a school and they need to raise funds for this. The immigrants from this village can send their contributions directly to the community and people from all over the world can send donations directly.

There's a difference between understanding a financial system and understanding a currency. Currencies (USD, GBP, Bitcoin etc.) are much easier to understand than financial systems. Furthermore, understanding how fiats are exchanged and, fundamentally, exist (that is, a physical note or figure in one's bank account), is much easier to comprehend compared to Bitcoin. Bitcoin is obviously a P2P system, where coins can't exist in a wallet unless the entire system agrees on how much and where that coin exists. It gets much more complicated than that at the technical level, which is why it's harder to understand than fiat, which can simply exist in your pocket without anyone else's consent.;3;0;False;lokomoko99764;dr351gq;"Bitcoin exposes the massive economic illiteracy of financial journalism; arm yourselves with knowledge.";7iyej5;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7iyej5/bitcoin_exposes_the_massive_economic_illiteracy/

"I know what you mean. But a good version of the above statement is some of what Andreas Antonopolous talks about where you distinguish between 'secrecy vs privacy' and 'surveillance vs sousveillance' and what an open blockchain can then offer. 

Secrecy is the privilege of the powerful to have their actions invisible from the masses. Privacy is the right of the individual to have their actions not be constantly monitored.

Surveillance is the powerful monitoring the weak. Sousveillance is the weak monitoring the powerful.

Our current financial system is built around 'secrecy' and 'surveillance'. 

An open blockchain allows the masses to demand transparency from those in power, so we deny them secrecy and can monitor those organisations for wrongdoings - especially if they are custodians for our money eg government. So the above example uses large corporations and we could imagine a future where they are mandated to declare public addresses so the country can monitor them for tax evasion or unethical behaviours. 

I think confidential transactions and privacy on the blockchain are *paramount* problems we need to fix, but there is also some good to be had in the option for transparent transactions.

The issue is as soon as it plateaus many of the people who got in it for the gains will get out, and that will cause it to drop which will cause even more to get out. Since most people in bitcoin fall into this group at risk of leaving, it’ll be a very fast drop. That’s why bubbles burst. The high value is only tied to the value increase. Without the increase, it loses its entire value, which is the definition of a decrease. There is no plateau, it’s up and up until it’s down. ;12;1;False;bobsmithjohnson;dr2rr31;"Bitcoin exposes the massive economic illiteracy of financial journalism; arm yourselves with knowledge.";7iyej5;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7iyej5/bitcoin_exposes_the_massive_economic_illiteracy/

"Which is why I think bitcoin fails as a ""currency"", but not necessarily as something of value.  Among various other things bitcoin (that I recall) really started getting real world investment when the financial situation in Europe started going bad (such as Greece).  When peoples faith in the banks fell below something few of them probably understood, crypto-currency.

Bitcoin has value because people put value on it and transferred from one form of value into another believing it to better hold the value it already had.

Bitcoin is much as useful as a currency as gold is, which is pretty impractical to use, however, gold can still be a good holder of value.  Which is where I think Bitcoin is and should go, rather than trying to have Bitcoin compete with the USD, it should be more anomalous with gold.

Other alt coins are better suited to constant transactions, but that doesn't mean they are as valuable as BTC, but they can be used as a transition between BTC and goods/services.  So BTC is to gold as  altcoins are to the USD.  The USD (or altcoins) are how we buy goods/services, but are backed by BTC.

"if BTC reaches the same level of popular usage as fiat, it might reach that point where it can be anonymous.

imagine some entrepreneur creating a product where you buy a little plastic card or something, like a pre-paid visa type of thing, but it has a chip on it that contains its own BTC wallet. So you send money onto it, and then you can just give someone the card. And there's no transfer of BTC to their wallet to track, you're physically handing them the wallet on that plastic card mimicking handing them cash. Sure there's a record of you taking money out of your personal wallet. But there's record of you withdrawing cash out of the bank the same way. And sure, if they deposit the money from that plastic card wallet into their personal wallet, that has a record, same as depositing cash. But the actual transaction from you to them is invisible since it was a physical transaction of a physical holder of currency, like cash.

and if you take that even further, those cards could become as common as fiat bills.

"Call me naive but I believe a lot of the world’s problems arise from mistrust of one another. Governments don’t trust each other, even allies. Government don’t trust their people. People don’t trust each other. So we’ve created all these intermediaries to kind of get us on the same page but they don’t always work due to human error. 

Bitcoin removes all of that. I think governments will eventually realize its more efficient and less wasteful to use a trustless system like bitcoin that keeps everyone in line without having to use the threat of force to do so. 

Look at how much government spend on defense and enforcement. They do so because they don’t trust each other. Remove the reason to not trust and now you’re free to use your funds for more profitable endeavors that also maintain the peace WITHOUT the threat of force against life, liberty, and property .";2;0;False;Ttatt1984;dr2vl26;"Bitcoin exposes the massive economic illiteracy of financial journalism; arm yourselves with knowledge.";7iyej5;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7iyej5/bitcoin_exposes_the_massive_economic_illiteracy/

Currency isn't wealth, its just a medium of exchange.

People make a zero-sum fallacy that if the individual unit value of a currency increases, then that must mean an increase in wealth.

Money only generates wealth by facilitating trade. In a hyper-deflationary system, it can be more profitable to not generate wealth than it is to generate wealth.

In the short term this might be profitable for the individual who benefits from skyrocketing currency prices, but in the long term everyone is worse off because people cease generating wealth. Eventually even the people who have hoarded the currency are worse off because there's less wealth to go round even if owning all that currency gives them a bigger slice of it.

We could have a gold standard based on a single gold atom, and issue coins representing 1 billionth of an atom even though its physically impossible to divide an atom that many times.

"Inflation is a great way to turn a first world country into a place like Venezuela.

Japan has been undergoing mild deflation since the 90's ; Venezuela's inflation has only been out of control for a few years and its created an enormous humanitarian crisis.

Runaway inflation is the end game for all inflationary debt based fiat currencies. I somehow doubt that Venezeulan economists were trying to create runaway inflation. Like all economies bolstered by inflationary money; when it came to financial crisis they can choose to either to continue inflating the currency leading to hyperinflation; or they can choose to say ""sorry government is bankrupt"" and just give up. I can't think of a single example where a government or bank willingly gave up its power to inflate for the good of the people; instead they always inflate. When push comes to shove fiat currencies will choose to inflate rather than die; and this inevitably leads to hyperinflation when you have debt-based fiat.";3;1;False;45sbvad;dr33cnn;"Bitcoin exposes the massive economic illiteracy of financial journalism; arm yourselves with knowledge.";7iyej5;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7iyej5/bitcoin_exposes_the_massive_economic_illiteracy/

"Before you feel special, I wrote this for a class. It's part of a much larger paper. 

For starters, Bitcoin’s extreme price volatility makes it useless as a store of value or as a standard of deferred payment. Bitcoin’s volatility risk (its tendency to change rapidly and unpredictably) is 7 times higher than gold, 8 times higher than the stock market, and 18 times greater than USD (Williams, 5). Its price is often random and unpredictable, and its sudden price peaks and drops force markets that use Bitcoin as their medium of exchange not to list their prices in Bitcoin itself, but to price with USD to keep pricing consistent, as often Bitcoin can have price shifts of over 20% in mere hours. 
	Additionally, Bitcoin’s non reversibility makes it fail as a medium of transaction. While cash has to be stolen in person and credit card fraud is covered by the company and can be charged back, Bitcoin has neither protection. It has the convenience of letting thieves steal information from a distance, and the finality and anonymity of cash (that is to say, the name of people completing cash transactions are not recorded automatically like with credit cards). 
This causes Bitcoin theft to be extremely prevalent, with sometimes hundreds of millions of dollars being stolen at once (Takemoto and Knight, 2017), and once they are stolen, there is nothing for the victim to do. Bitcoin’s setup as being fully anonymous implicitly encourages thieves, offering them full protection against any recourse by keeping them anonymous, and guaranteeing them to be able to keep their stolen wares by not having a reversal mechanism. Money laundering through Bitcoin is simple, as Bitcoin wallets (where people store their bitcoins) are tied to numbers, not to people, thus a wallet could be assigned to anybody. Bitcoin’s vulnerability to theft requires users of Bitcoin to use arcane and confusing systems, often having to be stored in an Air Gap (A computer that is fully disconnected from the internet), mitigating any of the convenience of Bitcoin. As Berkeley Professor Nicholas Weaver puts it, “Let's pause for a moment to reflect... What sort of online currency requires using offline computers and objects for all storage?”
	At any rate, Bitcoin is not a good store of value because it does not have a reason for value. Gold for example has value because of its practical purposes. It is attractive, and usable not only as jewelry, but for dentistry and for electronics. Gold’s value is very unlikely to zero because it will have practical value. On the other hand, while United States Dollars (USD) does not have a practical purpose, it is guaranteed by the federal government to always be valuable. It has a strong backing system that keeps faith in its system, and by law USD has to be accepted to pay government obligations and private debt. 
	However Bitcoin has neither legitimate use nor legitimate backing. Bitcoins do not exist. They do not have material existence, nor do they have “even the virtual existence of MP3 or video files” (par. 2). They have no use outside of currency. Unlike USD, they are not guaranteed as currency either. No government backs Bitcoin, in fact it is quite the opposite, Bitcoin touts itself as being controlled by nobody. There is no legal guarantee for Bitcoin to be usable, thus making Bitcoin inherently useless.
This is non-existence is comparable in theory to money in a bank account. The client cannot see the money they might have in their account, and the money may not physically exist, and if it is transferred to another bank account, no physical money would change hands, just the ledgers for each person would be modified, similar to a Bitcoin transaction. In his letter to the SEC, Professor Jorge explains the difference between a Bitcoin ledger and a bank ledger:
	A bank is bound by contract and by law to transfer the amount stated in that 
ledger to other banks, or to cash, if the client requests it; and the government is morally obliged to preserve the purchase value of that cash, to a reasonable degree. But there are no legal, contractual, or moral obligations about Bitcoin transfer or conversion to other money instruments; and there is no entity tasked with preserving its value. (par. 5)
	Bitcoin is therefore more comparable to a Ponzi scheme, or to penny stocks. They are assets of a system without value. Bitcoin does not have any assets, any products, any staff, or provide any services, it does not have a backing entity, or any financial review board. Its value comes solely from speculation, “based on expectations of traders about future prices, which will be based on expectations of future expectations…” (par. 10)

No, you missed the point. There's a fixed supply of both gold and bitcoin and gold standard currencies were volatile and, in general, terrible at being currencies. The USD doesn't have these issues previously because it is controlled by a central bank. The reason is that central banks work, despite your erroneous claims that they can't control hyperinflation.

No, the issue is deflation at all. Spending creates liquidity, which incentivises production. Deflation incentivises saving, which necessarily means people are less willing to spend on non-essentials.

How the hell are you going to offset 10% deflation?

I mean sure Apple has a massive ROI, but that's because the market is huge, with that high deflation the market will reduce and prices + the ROI will drop.

The higher the deflation the less investors, the less jobs, the less people have money, the less people can buy.

Also, less people are willing to spend money on things which causes more business to fail, less jobs, less investors again, no reason to throw away your money if you have a 0% risk if you just keep it and still get 10%.

like I posted elsewhere, if BTC gets to the point of being used that often, we'll see more innovation.

Like a pre-paid visa card. And stores would accept these as payment. So you could purchase ten 2 mBTC cards from your spending wallet.

Sorta, but not exactly. Like I said in my original post, it very well could have a redeeming value, but that value doesn’t matter as it is so much lower than the current value. If bitcoins real redeemable value is $100 it would have to drop 99% from its current price before that true valuation was realized. I’d certainly call that a crash! Additionally, any value as a currency would require it being used as a currency, which it isn’t right now, and can’t be until it crashes (because it can’t be used as a value store until it returns to some normalcy). So yeah, it’s possible in 10 years bitcoin will be a real currency, and it’s possible that in 10 years it’ll also have a huge value. But it isn’t possible that it will get there without some massive crash in between now and then.  ;6;0;False;bobsmithjohnson;dr2sm99;"Bitcoin exposes the massive economic illiteracy of financial journalism; arm yourselves with knowledge.";7iyej5;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7iyej5/bitcoin_exposes_the_massive_economic_illiteracy/

It's a store of value because, over long periods of time, the value put into it either persists, or goes up. This is due to its ultimately limited supply in addition to its unique usecases. (Bitcoin is currently slightly inflationary by the way, but will become deflationary). Check.

"The original proposal was that a distributed committee would need to be formed to issue more bitcoin in the future, which is simply wrong.

Bitcoin is deflationary in nature, so that's an ""issue"" whether this bitcoin committee is replacing lost coins at 1:1 rate or not.  It's simply a matter of how much.

Although I agree it couldn't replace USD ""right now"", I disagree that a deflationary currency could not work for the following reasons:

* I still need to eat, live in a shelter, cover various health related expenses.

* Investors and entrepreneurs will look to outperform deflation.

* I don't want to wait until I'm 95 to live the life I dream.  At some point people will just pull the trigger and spend.  I've already ""cashed out"" on some luxuries, in fact, and I don't regret it.

It's almost always more profitable to invest your USD in low risk investments than buy a new car, or a laptop, or a Gucci purse but people still do it.  So there's a point where it's not about profitability vs spending. Judging bitcoin on its explosive growth as how it will always be doesn't make much sense.  For example, if we assume bitcoin stabilizes in 15 years and experiences 10% deflationary growth per year after that, both investors and consumers would still spend.  When does it stop making sense?

They attempted to do so in 2006, by a few percentage points, but were forced to push rates to zero in 2008 and astronomically expand their balance sheet. The Fed can only pull the lever in one direction without crashing the economy. Rate increases of 0.25% increments over a period of 10 years don't count. The rates are nowhere near normalized. Nowhere near healthy. If a recession occurs, the Fed will be forced to push the FFR into negatives.

You are correct, of course, that funding matters in universities, (and this happens in all fields) but indeed, economics has produced a variety of unconventional thinkers and the Nobel has reflected that in recent years. Thaler's award, from this year, was met with tons of criticism and acclaim for his divisive work in behavioral economics. Take a look at the Nobel recipients, Angus Deaton, Oliver Hart, Joseph Stiglitz, to name a few.  

Surveying some of the major institutions, MIT, for example, you'll find people like Dr. Acemoglou and Dr. Angeletos, known for harsh criticisms of elite rule and the liberal order. Dr. Nunn, who teaches at Harvard, did amazing work on agricultural policy and civil conflict worldwide, hardly a shill for big business. Stiglitz teaches at Columbia.  Pikketty is the associate chair of the Paris School. Need I go on?

"Storing your hard earned savings in cash isn't a good idea regardless of inflation. Investing beats inflation. 

Inflation is not rampant, it has been very stable at about 2% from the 1980's. Inflation may  proportionally have a more negative impact on the poor (but it is by no means a major reason for poverty), however, the money that gets ""stolen"" ends up with the government, which uses money proportionally more to help the poor.

If the Fed suddenly decided to stop printing money, what would happen? The value of a dollar would increase dramatically, and anyone with large amounts of cash would become richer. However, the amount of wealth in the world and the production capacity (workers, factories etc.) would stay the same. This would mean that the people who didn't have cash would become poorer.";2;0;False;uqobp;dr33kr0;"Bitcoin exposes the massive economic illiteracy of financial journalism; arm yourselves with knowledge.";7iyej5;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7iyej5/bitcoin_exposes_the_massive_economic_illiteracy/

Yes. I understand why there exists a target inflation of 2%. It's to prevent a liquidity trap.

"I agree that gold standard currencies have volatility and I agree that they have their own problems. But to say that gold is a ""bad"" currency when it has been used as one for thousands of years is kind of an exaggeration. Gold is bad when you're a government that needs to keep funding programs which no longer have a source for that funding. 

The Athenians debased their currency to fight the Spartans. The Romans debased their currency to fund wars and social programs. The Chinese had a currency collapse due to rampant counterfeiting. The Germans printed their currency into oblivion to pay for war reparations. Our currency has been created into the trillions and it is very unlikely that the Fed will ever actually undergo a QT. The political climate is such that we will never cut spending and will only keep going into more debt, so we're always going to need more money.

My argument isn't that a fixed supply currency is perfect, my argument is that a fixed supply currency inevitably re-emerges as a baseline currency when hyperinflation destroys fiat currencies.

"Let me explain it this way.

There are 100 people. with 100 bitcoins

People 1-99 each own .9 bitcoin, and person 100 owns the rest (90.9 bitcoin) Now lets say that person 100 wants more money. In a deflationary economy he sits back, props his feet up and makes 2% a year (on currency) and thus makes 1.78 bitcoin in todays market value next year. So whats the problem? Theres only 98 bitcoin left. So this guy didn't do anything to get a bigger percentage of the pie.

So if you have a full economy of this going on you have 2 things. You have wages going down (in terms of bitcoin) because, well, theres not enough bitcoin to go around. Then on top of that you could invest in something for a percentage return on investment, say even 0%, someone pays you back in full, and you still profit.

So with a deflationary economy you have full risk of someone paying you back when you could do nothing and get better returns on your investment. so you don't spend your money, you hoard (HODL) it. So now the people with .9 bitcoin each had to stay alive and spend .1 bitcoin each, so now, instead of wealth being created, its just going to the hoarders. But in this situation theres no reinvesting, no need for paying other people and no need for spending because you're getting richer by having money under a mattress.

This is also true for stagflation (0% change in inflation). What you want is inflation, where you want your $1 to go down in value so you seek out value with your money. You want to buy into things like Amazon, Google, Tesla, GE etc, because you believe they will create more value than sitting in the bank account. How? Well theres a lot of things that contribute to a companies value, but first and foremost is spending and something called velocity of money. If GE is making a profit it means that people want it, and people can spend money on it. 

But that money comes from somewhere, so in inflation money is added to allow for economic growth. In deflation you are just finding a business who decays the slowest, and at that point why be in business, when you can just hold onto the money originally?";1;0;False;SSJRapter;dr3bf1a;"Bitcoin exposes the massive economic illiteracy of financial journalism; arm yourselves with knowledge.";7iyej5;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7iyej5/bitcoin_exposes_the_massive_economic_illiteracy/

One wishes for all its transactions to be private. The other offers a fully transparent ledger. Now they are both competing for donors and it is up to the individual donor whether they *trust* the first charity so much that they are willing to forgo independent verification.

The tricky part is when choice is removed from the individual. For example in the case of government or private corporations that have an oligopoly style arrangement, eg Equifax and credit scores.

Then that free choice is taken from us and accountability must be the pay off. And since we'd like to remove needing to *trust*, transparency then allows independent verification.

"Minister99, you've hit on the single and only REAL issue facing Bitcoin: 

Government attack.

Fortunately there's a way to stop governments from crushing Bitcoin: It's by use of a simple app that everyone has on their phone that converts dollars into crypto WITHOUT a bank being aware that is what the transaction is for.

The app is basically a decentralized crypto-exchange that is NOT ON A CENTRALIZED DOMAIN NAME, but is connected to a decentralized transaction blockchain. 

This app is on everyone's phone and connects to every other copy of the app via the blockchain. It automatically uses smart contracts to verify receipt of fiat payment (e.g. Dollars) being exchanged for Bitcoin by accessing the verification data from a banking app on the phone, then releases the Bitcoin it is holding in escrow to the buyer.

It is global just like bitcoin, is beyond the reach of governments and no bank can track the exchange taking place either, because the app separates the Bitcoin and Fiat aspects of that transaction, so it always looks like someone is simply sending funds via their bank to another person with no mention of Bitcoin anywhere. 

It cannot be attacked, corrupted, stomped on or stopped.

"I'm comparing it to all currencies with a fiat monetary base. A central bank backing isn't really relevant because the issue is the valuation and supply of a currency. Not the issuer. Government or central bank, it doesn't really matter. And, historically, 99% of all fiat currencies ever issued have failed. Central bank or no. The Weimar Republic's central bank hyperinflated the value of the German Mark. Result was a collapse of the currency and economic disaster.

Now, again, the monetary system of today, for the entire globe, has only existed on a fiat standard for 46 years. I didn't say Fiat currencies immediately collapse. They have, without fail, collapsed none the less. The British Pound has been going on for quite a while, but only in name really. Backed by Stirling Silver for most of its existence and altered a number of times in the 20th century.

The Romans managed to debase their currency and ""print"" copper denarius after previously using pure gold for over a hundred years before it collapsed. But it did collapse, yet the value of gold itself has remain since the Egyptian times. I would argue that we're operating on a relatively short timescale because of the signifcantly increased speed at which we conduct our economic business. 

Entities like the Fed can, and certainly do, induce a ""controlled rate"" of inflation in our fiat currency. Something many economists would say is healthy. What the fed cannot do, however, is *prevent* massive hyperinflation. Once a currency goes down that path, it's pretty much done for. Well. I guess you could technically prevent hyperinflation. But you would have to ""destroy"" circulating currency. Something that, ultimately, requires a loss of wealth on someone's behalf. Something that the Fed or any other central bank is ever likely to do.

This is very different from taxing income which is  ( somewhat ) more legitimate: governments have been taxing wealth through inflation for more than a decade. And for what ? So that powerful bankers can continue taking risks, chasing the profit while people like me pay the actual price.

I picked my poison, it is Bitcoin. You can stick with crony capitalism if you want, we'll see who does better in 30 years.

"You can’t buy into something this volatile as a store of value. That makes no sense. If it’s value is constantly changing immensely, it’s by definition an investment, not a value store. That’s why a savings account stores value and a roulette table doesn’t. Additionally, playing a bubble is not risk diversification anymore than, again, gambling. The idea of risk diversification is to expose yourself to markets that are dependent on different factors. So if the tech market collapses, you don’t lose everything. Or if automobiles are replaced by hover boards, you don’t lose everything. Again, buying into a bubble doesn’t accomplish this as there is no scenario where the bubble a steady investment. It is simply taking on more risk, not spreading it out. 

Since both of those things you posted as alternatives boil down to playing the bubble, which is another way of saying buying in for the price increase, yes, everyone is buying in for the price increase. 


Gold is different because it exists. There can be spikes and drops in the price, and if you check, there are. But at the end of the day gold can be turned into things and shown off, and is therefore not likely to “pop” as a bubble. A huge chunk of the world would have to decide gold is ugly and useless for its price to collapse, whereas people just need to stop thinking bitcoin will go up for its price to collapse.

That is exactly backwards. Such a country would now be the richest country in the world.

You are complaining about something that is actually a positive feature.

That literally can't happen. If there were one global currency, its total market cap could only increase in proportion to the growth in world productivity. Because currency is only a future claim on actual goods and services.

I'm not making a prediction here that we will see bitcoin as a single global currency. I'm just responding to your preposterous hypothetical.

> If its attracted speculators then its attracted people who bought in only to profit and will cash out the second it looks like they've made all the profit they're likely to.

If bitcoin begins to see use as a real currency, they won't have to cash out. You will begin to see huge demand that isn't coming from speculation.

A lot of bitcoins are presumably held by people who didn't cash out at 30, 300, 600, or 6000, or even 12,000. Those people aren't going to cash out easily. And the more bitcoin goes up, the less they need to cash out to have a rich lifestyle.

> What exactly was the reason?

Financial innovation and complexity or as it should be called ""scams and ponzi schemes""

There are some obvious winners in the age of financialization: Financial industry managers and shareholders see their incomes grow much more rapidly than other skilled professionals. But corporate managers and wealthy investors also profit as stock prices rise.

Who loses? The poor and the working class don’t have the capital or expertise to take advantage of new investment opportunities. These people suffer disproportionately from layoffs or reductions in salary and benefits — the choices firms make to keep profit margins and stock prices high. Working folks also carry most of the growing debt that is needed to maintain living standards when wages and benefits are stagnant as financialization takes hold.

Holding fiat was never the idea, and if everyone holds their fiat instead of investing them the whole economy dies. Nobody decides to start new companies, nobody buys new equipment.

">But people have needs and have to pay for their expenses. And it's not like people who hold will end up with more. The rate of the value of Bitcoin changing would be the same for everyone.

The rate being the same doesn't mean everyone is affected equally.

If you had 10% annual deflation, that means someone who has 0 dollars left over at the end of the month after paying for rent and food, makes $0. someone with $1,000,000 gets the equivalent of $100,000 a year and would never have to work again. even if they didn't keep that money in the bank, even if they earned no interest on it, they could still take 10% of that money every year and spend it. In fact they could spend $90,000 a year, and grow their fortune at the same time.

Or lets say someone invests $1,000,000 in a business that grows 5% a year. But deflation is 10% a year, so why would they both spending money on a business if it makes less money than simply doing nothing? They could make an extra 5% a year by doing nothing.

Where is that value coming from? From the genius wealth producing innovation of keeping money buried under your mattress? It's coming from people who are generating wealth and so are increasing the demand for money to trade that wealth. It's parasitic economic behavior. You are rewarded for doing nothing and punished for actually trying to spend money to create wealth if you can't create wealth faster than deflation. Deflation itself creates no wealth, it simply concentrates wealth in the hands of those who hold money at the expense of those who hold wealth in other forms. This is how deflationary spirals happen. Once people start to realize that holding money is more profitable than trying to use money to make money, then they stop spending it, and when they stop spending it companies start to go out of business, and then people lose their jobs, and then less people are getting paid and even less people are buying anything.

You need to increase the supply of money as the supply of wealth increases to avoid this happening.

>A currency that isn't heavily circulated (not always spent by everyone) is still a currency and I don't see anyone wrong with that.

Try to spend a gold coin in a store and you'll see what's wrong with it. You can say ""its still currency, just because not many people spend it doesn't mean its not"", you can say ""but gold goes up in value! why would you want dollars when they just depreciate!"", the cashier is still going to tell you to go fuck yourself. Something being valuable doesn't make it a currency.

The difference is, gold is valuable because of massive demand for gold jewelry and natural scarcity. Bitcoin is only supposedly valuable because its useful as a currency.

"Notably, Joseph Stiglitz [does not claim this](https://www.cnbc.com/2014/02/18/stiglitz-touts-the-merits-of-an-increased-minimum-wage.html).  

What you're referring to is that in most introductory economics courses, students are taught that the minimum wage acts as a price floor. I actually am of the opinion that this tends to be poorly taught in most introductory courses and I usually try to highlight the model's key assumption (which are very strong assumptions) - i.e, that cost of finding labour is zero, that the labour market is perfectly competitive, and that the cost of providing labour is below the minimum wage. In the case of Seattle, I would wager that the real world violates the latter assumption.  

Actual work in mainstream economics has found that the impacts of the minimum wage tend to be greatly overstated. [Here's a foundational paper by Card and Kreuger](http://davidcard.berkeley.edu/papers/njmin-aer.pdf) (both mainstream economists) that shows this with real world data. In general, data seems to indicate that increases in the minimum wage may cause firms to hire less workers than they would have intended to, had the minimum wage not gone up. Of course, this should be unsurprising - there exists a theoretical minimum wage at which firms would no longer hire, and would likely begin to lay off workers (particularly low-skill workers). I would argue, as Stiglitz and many others have, that this point is far higher than the minimum wage is now and due to increases in the cost of living (see: my above point on model assumptions), a minimum wage increase is justified. 

I'm sorry but it really doesn't sound like you have a grasp on what the field of economics is like in reality. Generally speaking, we try not to make statements in absolute. Seattle ""proves"" nothing aside from that under certain conditions, other effects may dominate the basic price-floor model. Figuring out what these conditions are (i.e., monopoly or monopsony control over the labour market, distortions in signals, high costs of living, etc.) and how to incorporate these into our models is precisely the job of economists.

"I like that people understand that bitcoin is pretty worthless. At least some people.

Everything you said is spot on. To add to that, most of the arguments for bitcoin are actually arguments for cryptocurrency in general. Cryptocurrency is a great technology and it is almost certainly here to stay. But bitcoin looks more like the prototype than the real deal.

The entire idea that money doesnt need to be backed is entirely fine. But a currency that is backed by something is always going to be stronger than one that isnt. This is the key to the future and why I believe bitcoin will inevitably crash.

The US constitution has rules on who can print money. It says that basically a federally controlled centralized institution is the only thing that can print money for the US. The importance here is that a major government is interested in who is allowed to print money and they dont like it when they dont have control over it. Its a bit of a stretch,  but bitcoin can be considered unconstitutional and illegal in the US because the federal government doesnt have control over who prints it. It makes sense really, its not like you can demand anyone to take your japanese yen or euro in the US and that makes the market stable. In the early days of the US banks and states all over the country issues their own currency and that caused an unstable market with constant fluctuations. It looks similar to what is happening with all the different cryptocurrencies available today. So the government banned all Banks and states from printing their own money and started the US mint (im really glossing over this detail). All of those random bank and state currencies then became worthless.

The same thing is going to happen to bitcoin. The focus as to bitcoin becoming a viable currency is its adoption by society. People think that US banks will one day do transactions in bitcoin. But why shoukd the chosen currency be bitcoin? Well it wont for the same reason that the US government  doesnt let just anybody print money. The government wants to control the money supply as it sees fit and it has absolutely zero control over bitcoin.

So how would the US use this new found technology called cryptocurrency? It would develop its own cryptocurrency backed by the US government. Lets pretend this cryptocurrency is called the Amero and It enters the market replacing the dollar. You cN exchange all your current dollars for ameros and gain all of the benefits of a cryptocurrency.

Well where does that leave bitcoin, an unbacked rogue currency that is moslty used for darknet purchases. Well it leaves it in the trash. One BTC could be selling for $10,000,000 and it would crash to pennies overnight as everyone begins panic selling in order to convert into a governnent backed cryptocurrency. 

And that is really the future of bitcoin. The instant any government issues its own cryptocurrency bitcoin is going bye bye

Your argument looks at your happy world and says everything is fine.

Its easy to compare a policesman's pension and waiting in line at Starbucks, because you have the luxury to those things.

You bring some great points and I do agree that most major world governments are not going to replace their currency with a decentralized monetary system.  Leading economists would also tell us that a decentralized system is a terrible idea because central banks assist the economy through monetary policy.  And most of the time, they do an ok job of helping the economy.  If it wasn’t for quantitative easing, the World financial system would have fucking collapsed.  After 2008 banks simply stopped loaning money because they had lost so much on people defaulting.  The 2008 financial crisis was the faults of banks, rating agencies, and greedy financial illiterate people who though they could afford a house WAY outside of their earnings level or future earnings level.  The centralized currency system in the US didn’t cause the financial crisis.  The federal reserve didn’t cause it.  The federal reserve helped save the fucking system.  If the world only transacted in bitcoin or another decentralized system, how the fuck could governments save the financial system?  The answer is there would be NOTHING they could do to help and the financial system would collapse.

"A few points:

> they can be used to pay down US citizens' tax obligations

This is *not* backing.  You've severely misunderstood the concept of *backing* if you believe this to be the case.  Backing is not important because the medium of exchange needs to have its own money.  Backing is an antiquated attempt to strip the issuer of the ability to issue funds at their discretion.  This is in response to several historical cases of money debasement; a form of theft from the populous by the government.

The backing must be valuable because otherwise the government could fabricate *the backing* and thus indirectly inflate.

Backing is not about having value, but about preventing institutionalized theft, which has historically terrible repercussions.

> I am much, MUCH less concerned that my US bank account will disappear due to some technical trapdoor, or compromised because somebody hacked into the computer systems at my credit union.

Only because the bank has purchased insurance from the government and additionally swallows enormous sums of fraud on an annual basis.  

> When you write this kind of BS that 'the establishment is just trying to protect the status quo', you sound like a lunatic conspiracy theorist who things that GM knows how to make cars run on water but won't tell us because of the oil cartel.

Bad example; GM literally bought up trolley cars in the '40s to sell more cars.  That shit does happen.  However, I'd agree that there's a mountain of anti-establishment sentiment in this sub that is unsubstantiated.

> If Bitcoin was a digital pantheon of economic exchange that was going to usher in the modern era of banking, then you know who would be all over that shit? BANKS.

Kind of like how Ripple is successful, Quorum is huge, Bank of America just got patents for some kind of block-chain based exchange platform?  Like that?

Millions of truck drivers with unsecured wallets, policeman's pensions sitting on the blockchain, Starbucks waiting 5 minutes to confirm that your $5 coffee (+ $5 settlement fee) can be handed over? 3 transactions per second for the entire world?

"this is all true (although much of it only in the near term and would not be an issue after wide adoption)

Bitcoin's value comes from the fact that it is uninflatable, immutable and cannot be confiscated. This makes it ideal for final settlement and large, important (and international) transactions, and in theory a long term store of value if it gains wide adoption.

Do you guys really not see how srupid this is? I don't care if this guy studied economics for 400 years that makes no sense. People won't spend bitcoin because they will be worth more later??? Why even have bitcoin then? People will buy things they need. Obviously. Please stop using the people don't spend bitcoin logic. They will spend it when they have to if they run out of fiat or want to buy a private island with their profits. Of course people will spend it. If it replaces the dollar they will use it to buy everything they need. Bitcoin doesn't stop people from consuming and we don't need inflationary money convince us to spend it like we are some kind of stupid animals that need economists to tell us to buy things.

"Going off this, look at reasons the underlying blockchain technology behind bitcoin is the actual reason for the hype.

Ethereum is allowing developers to build directly on top of it to fuel potentially revolutionizing decentralized applications. A project like the Request Network (https://request.network/#/) seeks to be a platform to utilize the blockchain technology as an immutable ledger for a source of auditing for business and banks a like. Think about how much money could be saved for banks / businesses not having to worry about audits, as well as having <0.5% fees on monetary transactions, and that's just one of the potential use cases. 

There are many other such projects like Request which are being developed right now on top of Ethereum which can change how things work, and a lot of projects have pretty big milestones in development being reached in Q1-2 of 2018.

Ethereum is technologically more proficient than bitcoin in a lot of ways, but it wasn't designed as a currency. I'm not saying bitcoin can't have a place in the space / be a store of value, but there are new applications and technologies being made which are far more proficient at what a lot of people hoped bitcoin would become. Bitcoin just has the advantage of being the 'brand' name. The transaction costs and volume are too high. 

Scaling is the ultimate issue, but in due time that will be the issue for all, although there are solutions in the works. 

A lot of people are trying to jump into Bitcoin with its insane gains trying to get into the action for some quick cash. That ship has sailed. 

Instead, get excited about what the blockchain technology is capable of, and what it can be used for.

"> Chartalism

Chartalism is fairly weak theoretically and historically. fiat money is not created by tax demand, but generally by debt issuance.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Monetary_Theory#Criticisms

And answer this simple mental exercise: If the dollar was *only* used for paying us government tax, and all trade was denominated in other currencies, what would the value of the USD be? 

> ""how does Bitcoin work""

To be fair, the same question would baffle even more people if the subject was the dollar. 

> 1) A medium of exchange 2) A store of value 3) A standard of value

While your categories are better than OP's, your criticisms are nearly all early adopter problems: short term volatility, and not understanding the need to use hardware wallets. 

If you assume that bitcoin stabilizes in price fluctuations (perhaps via a larger market size) and people become accustomed to using safe wallets, and proper payment networks are used (LN, etc) then your only remaining criticisms boil down to

* People arent pricing things in satoshi units yet because bitcoin has not displaced the dollar for most transactions yet.

"Interesting points, I agree on some and disagree on others.
Here is my take;

1) It is objectively easier to use bitcoin than email. All you need is an address and the amount you want to send, 2 parameters. The email usually needs 3 (address, subject and the message). As for easy to understand, I guess technology behind it is pretty complicated, but I bet you have no clue how email works either.

2) Point of bitcoin is for you to be your own bank and you have the responsibility of keeping it secure. Put your stuff on a trezor or ledger for the majority of your wealth (cold hardware storage) and for daily transactions use a web wallet or phone wallet with a small amount (savings and chequing account analogy). You are not scared of losing your money in your bank account because US, for now. Banks and governments are not as corrupt to those levels where they will run off with your money...just yet. But this is not the case for a LOT of people around the world, examples like Zimbabwe, Venezuela, anywhere in Balkans during hyperinflation where banks literally overnight just picked up and left with peoples pensions funds, etc. Banks are way less secure than the bitcoin protocol. It is WAAAAAAAY easier to hack into any bank than try to hack the bitcoin network (boreder line impossible). Just the apps being developed like the wallets have two-factor authentication meanwhile my bank has a password that can be easily obtained via keylogger and maybe a security question that is laughably easy to guess (mothers maiden name, pets name etc).

3) In this current state, I agree it is expensive for everyday transactions like buying coffee. Now, (not being a shill) Bitcoin Cash has solved this problem temporarily and its transactions fees are negligible and quick. Now I do not think that this a good solution for scaling, I do think LN is the way to go but I digress. Here is the thing, in its CURRENT state, we can do a comparison. Let's do a wire transfer from the US to Japan in $1000. Let's see which one gets there faster and cheaper (less paid in fees). You can use your bank of choice and I will use bitcoin. If this is a business account that you are sending to in Japan, you will most likely have to go to your bank's branch to do a wire transfer and pay at around $30 in fees, it will take at least 3-5 business days + any additional fees from the receiver bank. For large transactions, cross-border transactions, bitcoin is superior to any bank TODAY. Try moving 100k into and out of Philippians, it is a paperwork nightmare don't get me started on the fees. For bitcoin, give me an address and it will be there within the hour.

4) Each to their own but the grand goal is to not be a millionaire in dollars standard. The point here is to see it make it to the level where you WON'T be selling your bitcoin for dollars but using it to buy things with your bitcoin. 

5.) I agree on the first part, it is as safe as investing in an internet company/startup during the dot-com era. This is a new space and new tech. I don't think there are any doubts that the blockchain technology will stay, the question is which implementations will survive long term and for that, you have to do your own research (if you are investing). However, with that being said, IF bitcoin would come to the level of replacing the dollar, it would be an amazing store of value since its limited supply and its mimic of supply being generated to that of gold or other precious metals on top of it being divisible to any decimal point via an upgrade to the network if needed. You can know with certainty how much bitcoin will be in 20 years to the last decimal point since it works purely on mathematics. The dollar does not have that luxury. Inflation was following a 2% rate roughly for the past years but there is no guarantee that it will NOT rise. If anything, showing the incompetence of the government, rating agencies and banks in the 08 crash if anything shows that the dollar will hyperinflate in the coming years just purely on looking at the new money being introduced into the system in the last few years. With bitcoin, you will never have more than 21million and the ""inflation"" rate is known with certainty.  

6) Bitcoin is new, the market cap is small, and it is volatile as heck because of the big players trying to make money by influencing the markets. As more people jump in, volatility will die down too and stabilize as time goes on. Fun fact you could buy a brand new Mustang in 1965 for under $3000. 


Bitcoin price is soaring because more money is being put into it and it is used as money more today than years ago. It has a market cap in dollars of almost .3 trillion in dollars equivalent. It has a long way to go to catch up to US dollars and thus the price will go up with respect to dollars.

Transaction fees will be lowered as time goes on either with upgrades to the system or new cryptos what will solve the problems of fees entirely. Mining power consumption can be solved from going from Proof of Work (it cost roughly $1000 US dollars to create one bitcoin, giving it some intrinsic value in computational energy and power spent, how much does it cost to create one dollar bill? ) with Proof of Stake. Not commenting on the benefits of either or I am just pointing out that there is a solution already to the mining issue of power consumption and I am sure that new solutions will pop up that are vastly superior as time goes on. For validation times, potentially billions of transactions per second and transaction times check out LN, some other cryptos that have a cool solution to tps check out IOTA (not commenting if i think if iota is better by any stretch of imagination just point out that there are solutions in place for tps problems already). As for wallet protection, trezor is more secure than your bank account. It is not until you set up one that you realize just how insecure your bank account is. Banks will get on board using cryptos, or they will perish.

I do not want the whole world tomorrow to be on the blockchain and be using it as a currency. That would be madness. We are not ready yet, it takes time. Rome was not built in a day. The amount of progress made here is astonishing and in you bet in 10 years time I will like to see a portion of the world to move towards it. 
This is like criticising internet back in 1990s. You could NOT even imagine what it would come out of it and what is possible back then. THere was no way to predict youtube, facebook, amazon etc. These type of projects would have been called impossible back then with the internet speeds and infrastructure supporting it. Is it really so hard to see from the past progress we have made in the blockchain technology space with bitcoin and other prominent cryptos to see that these problems today plaguing it are solvable and have an untapped potential in the future? I love hearing opposing views and you SHOULD be sceptical of it. This is what makes the entire network stronger. Attack it, critique it and point out as many flaws. This is the power of open source projects that are decentralized. It is up to all of us to make it into the monetary system we want it to be to replace the inefficient and outdated one we have today that in salves people in debt. In Bitcoin, you don't owe anyone anything and nobody owes you anything. You don't need permission from anybody. 


TLDR: This is a new technology that still has ways to go but the points you have adressed are solvable. Rome was not build in one day and neither will bitcoin. It is great that you are crtiquing the system and i encourage everyone to attack it and do the same. This is what makes it stronger and it is up to all of us to make it into the monetary system that we want it to be. THat is the power of decentrilize open source projects and networks like bitcoin.

"Some of the people advocating for this technology believe volatility will reduce over time, and that the investment proposition is not the exciting aspect of this science experiment. Lightning looks promising at a glance - would it solve the high transaction fees and speed up payments? I did see that payment that made it look useful in that regard. The argument for bitcoin is an international exchange of value brought to the lower 4 billion of people that are unbanked. It becomes peer to peer exchnage without a central intermediary that can outcompete international remittances that traditionally consume 35% of value in fees. The quote I heard 78bn of fees vs 500bn in remittances transferred last year. The technology is not solving a 1st world problem. It is an alternative to the hyperinflation of argentina, brazil, amd venezuela. It provides an alternative to monetary policy that damages people's quality of life - monetary policy is not the same throughout the world. To discount the evolution of this may be the equivalent of discounting the internet in its current form - people seem to solve tech roadblocks over time. The internet could never replace phone and tv until it did. Whats app has changed how most of the world communicates. We are not arguing over long distance phone calls. The technology has no indication of stagnating. It may not be bitcoin that survives, but the world is on its way to being changed just as the world without the interet would be ridiculous in today's time. 


- easy to use is the wrong wording - the added value is peer to peer transactions without an intermediary. no currency conversion, no barrier to entry. there is an assumption by many that bandwidth of transactions and fees will drop over time. not necessarily with bitcoin, but something like it in 15 yrs.

- the concern with a trust in banks is that much of the world cannot trust banks. the u.s is comfortable. other countries are not. this tech is not an argument for adoption in the u.s but rather the rest of the world. let's see where the technology evolves from here before we discount every future iteration that will be built over time.

"Well grounded post. Just want to point out that some of the criticisms may not be valid at a future date. The protocol is still being developed and while we may perceive Bitcoin stepped into the stage as a finessed fighter ready to knock out current king (fiat) it’s not really the case. 

Instead it’s a very very new and infantile technology that has a loooooong way to go. We are still in alpha stage. 

At this stage I see a lot of old money economists defend fiat and the fiat world and how bitcoin will fail. This is hilarious because 1 that sort of change does NOT happen overnight so any get rich quick guys, sorry. 2 bitcoin is not ready. Quirks are being ironed out. This whole “bitcoin consumes too much electricity” is a valid concern now but it’s a problem that has the potential to be solved via increasing miner efficiency or hell even core protocol changes. It’s not a “oh hell man I went to the store to buy a loaf of bread and it’s half yeast, what the hell is this shit?” Well it’s not bread yet. Don’t buy it. There’s no company you’re going to sue cuz they pushed this “defective” product on to you. Don’t buy it. It’s a collaborative project and nature of such projects is that it’s slow moving and has decision making overhead. 

Basically I feel Bitcoin breaking into mainstream was sort of a mistake as it attracted people who assumed it was this finished product and they’re used to writing reviews that might help their fellow consumers so they see bitcoin as an unfinished product which is sort of is. 

Sit back and wait to see how the project goes ahead. It may not break your expectations but it’s built on hard work and interest of thousands of individuals. It’s very much an experiment at this moment so treating it as a battle hardened veteran is ... wrong. I understand a lot of fiat lovers are annoyed by the fact that btc backers think fiat is gonna be killed by btc. Fair enough.

"RE: Difficulty of Use

I definitely agree with this sentiment and used to think this (difficulty of use) would be the largest barrier to bitcoin adoption for the average user.  However, let's talk about what makes it confusing (I agree - it IS!).  A lot of people consider themselves to be tech-savvy and immediately start downloading the bitcoin core.  You very quickly need to familiarize yourself with how the wallet works and do research into how to properly secure your funds... which will then lead to creating another wallet and you start going down the bitcoin rabbit hole.  But, now compare this to the simplicity of using blockchain.info or coinbase.  You can set up 2-factor authentication and have a pretty darn secure wallet in a matter of minutes... and documentation to show you how to use it.

The entire bitcoin platform is complex and overwhelming to many people.  But, how many people own a checking account?  Of those people, how many of them understand how their transactions are recorded and how banks clear money between one another?  They don't!  Let’s use Chase as an example.  Chase controls the technologies that Chase customers use to conduct their banking.  Chase also uses their agreement with other banks and other frameworks in order to clear money between parties with as little risk as possible.  There is a huge layer of abstraction between what is actually happening in the banking world versus what the average checking account owner understands.

So, whats the difference?  We still need technologies that use the underlying Bitcoin framework which hide this difficulty in order to make it easier for the average user to utilize.  If you don't need those technologies, you don't have to use them and you can use bitcoin core for all of your financial transactions.  If you WANT to understand the intricacies of the platform, it is open source and you can easily work through it.  On the other hand, how would Chase respond to a request for the level of transparency that bitcoin provides?  They would say that A. They can’t give information for the security of their customers B. Everything is proprietary C. They would never allow anyone to see a part of their ledger unless they were being audited or it was a part of some regulatory compliance.  Once you give them your money, it goes in to a black box and that’s it.

You are the sole owner of your bitcoin.  If you want to transfer it, you throw in a small transaction fee, giving incentive for the bitcoin network to process it and include it in the “global” ledger.  You get rid of Chase altogether and don’t throw your money into a “black box”.  If a financial institution wants to use the bitcoin framework, they can.  The manner in which this framework is used presents unlimited possibilities... many of which will make the platform much easier for the general population to use.

There are much larger issues with bitcoin than ease of use… some of which are presented very well in this writeup.

This is one of the funniest points I see made about Bitcoin by people with little knowledge of economics and how currency works within economic systems. At the same time as proclaiming Bitcoin to be the best, modern medium of exchange, it's simultaneously advertised as a deflationary currency (as if that somehow lends to the medium of exchange idea). While I don't have anything against Bitcoin as a store of value, claiming that it's an ideal replacement for fiat currency in the global economy is laughable.

"I'm glad you took the time to write this, I don't think I've seen worse pseudo-economics upvoted to the front page before.

One more point to add on the ""store of value"" argument that often gets brought up, is that currency doesn't need to be a store of value over decades, because you can just use it to buy stores of value.

A currency that is useful for day to day transactions but isn't useful for saving wealth for 20 years is still a useful currency. A currency that is useless for day to day transactions but is useful for saving wealth for 20 years is not a good currency, its just an asset.

People seem to think just because something is valuable then people will want to accept it as currency, but it takes more than being a ""store of value"" to be a currency. Gold is a much better ""store of value"" than dollars, but try spending a gold coin anywhere and see how well ""but dollars lose their value over time!"" helps in getting the cashier to accept it.

The very fact gold appreciates in value over the long term is one of the reasons it can no longer be used for coins. No one wants to spend a coin that's more profitable to hoard than to spend.

Currency only generates wealth via facilitating trade. A currency that rewards you for not spending it is necessarily a bad currency because it means people are discouraged from trading and encouraged to hoard.";166;3;False;suninabox;dr34d2o;"Bitcoin exposes the massive economic illiteracy of financial journalism; arm yourselves with knowledge.";7iyej5;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7iyej5/bitcoin_exposes_the_massive_economic_illiteracy/

">Transaction fees, energy usage due to mining, validation waits, Wallet protection, and exchange with existing monetary infrastructure - all of these things are lacking in fundamental, unfixable ways.

Transaction fees aren't unfixable, as we've seen with segwit. Let's see what happens with the Lightning Network before we say it's unfixable.

Energy usage? Pff, it costs 10% of your mining income to pay for electricity. Climate change due to energy usage? Renewables. Solar. Look at Envion -- they're placing shipping containers full of miners next to large solar farms.

Validation waits: Lightning Network. We'll see.

Wallet protection: The only difference between my bank account and my bitcoin account is that I *want* to take the risk and hold my bitcoin instead of someone else. A broker offered to sell my grandpa bitcoin, which I'm sure the broker would have held on to. Old people can get in it, too, without knowing the technology.

Exchange with existing monetary infrastructure: Anonymous currency won't replace many aspects of fiat until a decentralized system of identification online is developed, because you can't hold a bitcoin wallet owner accountable for not paying back debt. All credit and debt-related infrastructure will therefore remain until this is developed. I know of two projects currently working on decentralized identification without relying on biometrics; comment if you want to know more.

Another thing about exchange with existing monetary infrastructure: Most of this infrastructure only exists in the developed and developing countries. The only infrastructure needed for bitcoin is a smartphone, electricity, and internet access. Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk are independently trying to put wifi all over the planet, with solar drones and satellites respectively. Over 100,000 new people are gaining access to electricity every day. The places that have the most work to do are actually the places with infrastructure.

"Hi, I'll probably get downvoted to oblivion but wanted to respond to some of your comments. I agree with you that the fanboy mania on this sub is ridiculous but overall I find blockchain tech fascinating and I don't think it's fair to immediately dismiss or state that it has no value. 

First, I don't agree that people should call Bitcoin a currency. It's not. Its a ledger. A public ledger that anyone can access, use and trust that is decentralized. That is the major breakthrough of the tech and its the most important idea you can take from it. Bitcoin (and this sub) receives the most attention because it was the first to introduce the idea of blockchain. I honestly don't know if Bitcoin itself will be the future of blockchain tech but given that it was the first, I can imagine its going to be around for a while if the tech continues to grow.

1) I agree with you, if you ask someone what is Bitcoin and how do you use it, they will have a hard time explaining it. Again I think this is because people keep pushing the idea that it as a currency. It's a ledger. A record of all the transactions that have happened on the network. I found this video provides a really good understanding of how blockchain tech works: 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBC-nXj3Ng4

In any case, I agree, right now it is not easy to use and still has a lot to go in terms of easy of use. But the internet was the same when it first started. If you asked a basic users to interact with all 7 layers of the OSi model in order to post something on Reddit, it wouldn't be intuitive either.

2) Stating that the underlying tech in blockchain is not tamperproof is not fair. The tech itself is tamperproof as it is backed by the entire field of cryptography and computer science. If someone was to hack the cryptographic nature of blockchain, (i.e. as you stated, hacking a wallet by producing the private keys from a public address), there would be bigger problems in the world as basically every known encryption tool would become void. With regards to Banks, when the internet first started it took quite some time for them to trust it and start offering online banking. I am also sure they did get hacked (tho not a frequent as it is now) back in the day when it first started. But still other major organizations have been recently hacked, Equitfax for example. I do agree with you that the current websites (such as exchanges, web based wallets, etc) need to be doing a better job with their security. For example, I have no idea why of the ones who did get hacked would have their wallets online without some kind of multi-signature withdrawal. Some people have pointed that it could have been an inside job as we are talking about tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars.

3) Yes bitcoin is really expensive in terms of transaction costs when it comes to small value transactions. But its relatively cheap if you're doing large transactions. Again for me, I don't Bitcoin as a currency. The transaction costs are also high because the network is being flooded with transactions from all around the world. Also again, everyone is focusing on Bitcoin and putting all other blockchain tech under its umbrella of technical issues. I actually don't see Bitcoin becoming the underlying tech that replaces your VISA/MC terminal at starbucks or being a global currency that everyone uses. What I do see if local countries/economies creating their own blockchain (or bitcoin equivalent) that is traded locally (which would fundamentally have lowering fees and transaction times due to less demand) and then if you need to interact on a more global scale, you would trade/interact with Bitcoin itself or whatever tech that has capitalized on that market. I only say Bitcoin as it's the most trusted, well known and has stand the test of time so far in terms of being secure and tamperproof. With regards of the local economy analogy, think of how your local router has the 192.168.0.1 IP assignment to service your local devices and then you have the rest of the internet IP that you interact with. Some people argue well why not just do what IPv6 did and expand the number of addresses...well this is one of the talking points of the entire scaling debate going on. And this is what people should be talking about. How can we make this tech better and more accessible to everyone?

4) I agree, I don't think Bitcoin itself will be a medium of exchange in terms of goods and services, but there are other blockchain tech working on this.

5) I don't think Bitcoin should be trusted as a store of value in the sense of stability, not because of the tech but because it wasn't designed that way. It's also of fixed supply so it inherently is non-inflationary. Again, Bitcoin was the first attempt at designing a system that is suppose to be a public ledger that is decentralized. That is the value it creates. Whether that value goes up and down is dependent on the market. Also, I think your bank savings comment is not the best example...if I knew that in 10 years my $20 would be worth 87% less, why would I keep a savings account? It would be better to find alternatives that hopefully grows. I also think Bitcoin is a bad example, but that's not to say that there aren't other coins that are trying to create an inflationary economy. What Bitcoin does provide in terms of storing value is that it cannot be forged and it is pretty easy to transfer from one account to another. I definitely think there's value in that...whether its $17000 worth is another story.

6) I agree I don't think Bitcoin should be pegged as a standard of value but again, I don't see it as a currency or something equivalent to the dollar. Where I see Bitcoin and other blockchain techs such as Ethereum becoming important and heavily utilized is in trade and in supply chain management. How contracts are made, payments, billing on demend, having your accounts (or at least your trades) transparent and visible to allow for de-risk and capital to flow to under developed areas where loans can be up to 20%. Microloans is a really interesting idea to allow capital to flow to these areas and I think blockchain can help with that.

Anyway sorry for the lengthy post. I do think the fanboy status that this sub has taken is insane and I also don't like it when people write stuff that there are banking and oil cartels looking to suppress tech. This doesn't help or promote development and solutions. I also don't think its fair to state that this tech not fixable, unsustainable, and has deal-breaker problems without also providing support that people are working on these issues. You're painting a picture that is onesided and you can see it in the responses people are posting. ""Bitcoin is a ponzi scheme. It's a scam. It's going to crash, etc etc."" Banks, just like any traditional institution, are very slow to react and resistant to chain. Blockchain and bitcoin is still really early in its development and I can't see traditional banks jumping on it right away just as they didn't jump on online banking right away. These things take time. It will also take time for the services that are catering to crypto to mature and provide a product that is easy to use and intuitive. 

What I do love is that Bitcoin and blockchain is an opensource technology that anyone can access and is trying to solve an problem that has been around for a while. How do we allow for trustless interactions to happen across the global with a system that accessible by anyone.

TL:DR - Bitcoin itself is not a currency, its a public ledger of transactions that happen on the network that anyone can access, use and trust. Some people are trying to use it as a currency, others for other applications. The tech is still new and still needs to grow. Here is a good video explaining it:

"Sir Bastian's arguments are weak and shortsighted. Let me go back through the points.

1.	Using crypto is currently relatively simple and easy, and is becoming more and more streamlined. It is entirely unfair and shortsighted to criticize bitcoin for its complexity by citing the relatively uncommon mistakes made by complete novices. These mistakes will go away promptly with software development.
2.	Your #2 argument is a straw man. You can’t discredit the certainty and permanence of bitcoin transactions and the blockchain with examples of people and exchanges storing their private keys improperly. Bitcoin transactions are tamperproof, uncensorable, and extremely secure. Try again.
3.	Agreed, except I’d take an optimistic tone about lightening and other emerging technology.
4.	It’s a great medium of exchange once fees and transaction times recover from the current infrastructure stresses in the btc network. It’s value as an exchange medium is that it’s extremely secure, fast, cheap, eliminates trust and middlemen, and borderless. Your example of irony highlights current perceptions of a world where bitcoin isn’t used as a currency, and where people are used to thinking of their wealth in dollars. This will obviously change when bitcoin can be readily exchanged for goods.
5.	I agree that bitcoin isn’t a store of value at the moment. It’s still in its infancy, and it’s still an investment. But since it is a convenient, cheap, safe medium of exchange, its market cap will likely keep growing and will start to stabilize. It’s market cap will have to be in the trillions before it’s a relatively stable currency. This is no problem as an international currency.
6.	Most of the world doesn’t care how many dollars they can get for a bitcoin. Bitcoin will be a much more useful international standard, since it is decentralized and useful everywhere.

The real criticisms of bitcoin are:

1. Most people's criticisms can be balled up into one: It's new, incomplete, and ever changing. We don't have precedent for global, p2p currency. It is potentially upsetting to local and world economies, and we don't have a sophisticated understanding of predictors and solutions to future problems. Poor policy and regulation is possibly the biggest threat to Bitcoin (which is not an inherent problem of Bitcoin). We need crypto developers to work with the government to create fair and perceivable laws and tax policy ASAP. We need cooperation and goodwill. A healthy free market will be only mildly turbulent as it adjusts to the new supply of currency.

2. So far, the crypto communities and certain individuals have demonstrated quite a bit of hostility towards each other. Open-source technology with this much interest, being tied to people's personal wealth, creates absolute chaos in participation. People are piss-poor at thinking for a global long term interest.

3. Developments made to technology are often designed and scheduled for the sake of retaining immediate value of a coin, rather than the best efforts to improve a coin for the long term. Price is often equated with quality and legitimacy, which is a distraction from the things that will ultimately make a coin valuable.";1;1;False;jazzfruit;dr33evb;"Bitcoin exposes the massive economic illiteracy of financial journalism; arm yourselves with knowledge.";7iyej5;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7iyej5/bitcoin_exposes_the_massive_economic_illiteracy/

"That doesn't mean we won't have adoption of bitcoin as the main carrier of value IMHO. 

Yes, inflation is needed to build an competitive economy on. Yes, inflation is good for the group. Money has to flow in the economic system in order to have a shot at keeping the same value; and that's what is good.

But inflation is bad for the (rich) individual, and in the end it is the small individual acts that matter. You and I -and larger parts of the population- will keep larger and larger proportions of their cash in BTC. And merchants will bend over backwards to be able to capture some of that value. Bitcoin as a payment option will become the rule.

IMHO we'll have an economic crisis, because deflation. If they can adopt bitcoin, the governments will remain stable. Even as they print money that has less and less value (furthering the fiat inflation, and the deflation of bitcoin). 

Currently, inflation is about 1%. When bitcoin will grow by volumes of 1% of the economic activity, we will reach the turning point where this inflation-deflation cycle kicks in.

As they adopt themselves bitcoin, the governments will rid themselves of their massive debts (print money till the debt is zero).

Hopefully a few fiat banks get turned into ashes along the way.

"Keyword: data. 

Suddenly, we may soon have a better gauge on the health of the economy, something we now don’t have because a lot of commerce is still handled thru fiat cash which can’t be tracked or measured or quantified. With bitcoin and the blockchain ledger, economists and policy makers and big corporations can now have access to where and how money is being spent. 

By checking the ledger and the addresses and the to and fro of transactions, everyone can know where the money is flowing to and from. Imagine if we all knew the bitcoin addresses of Walmart, Macy’s, Apple, Boieng , Halliburton, GoldmanSachs... the ones they use to accept payments (assuming they give in to the accepting bitcoin in one way or another). This has vast implications for how money flows in our economy and democracy. Everything becomes more transparent. We can measure to a high degree of exactitude how much money goes into a campaign fund, how much is going to non-profits, how much is going to their overhead or how much is getting to the people who need the help. As we saw in All the President’s Men, bitcoin allows anyone to “follow the money”. This forces everyone and everything to be transparent. Finally, we can know who is getting what by checking the activity in the bitcoin addresses. We may not know exactly how much but we can follow the activity of the addresses. 


Edit: just to be clear, yes I know transacted amounts are shown in the public ledger. For those concerned about privacy, this is why we use multiple wallet addresses. There is still data in here that has value where as in the current system no one knows what’s going to whom or where. Bitcoin keeps everyone honest. A system where everyone plays by the rules produces data that is more valuable than a system where you must factor in a certain margin of error due to some players not playing by the rules or just not playing in the game all together.";137;14;False;Ttatt1984;dr2j4ya;"Bitcoin exposes the massive economic illiteracy of financial journalism; arm yourselves with knowledge.";7iyej5;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7iyej5/bitcoin_exposes_the_massive_economic_illiteracy/
"The problem with the argument that Bitcoin is valuable because it is a better currency is that nobody is using it as a currency. It’s value is exploding because people want to make money off its value exploding. Does that mean it couldn’t be worthwhile? No. But it actually isn’t right now.  It’s currently in the midst of a bubble based on its value rising enough that it caught true mainstream attention, which caused a bunch of people to buy into it to try and make money off its value rising. This process builds on itself and is the classic definition of a bubble because once it runs out of steam and people stop joining the party it’ll start to go down. That’ll make everyone realize it’s no longer a get rich quick scheme and it’ll crash quickly. The chances of its popularity as a currency catching up to its popularity as an investment for the uninformed before a big crash are slim to none.

TLDR: You can’t claim bitcoin is valuable because it’s a great currency when nobody is using it as a currency. 

Edit: to add to that, it’s actually worse because the fact that it’s in the midst of a bubble means it’s insanely risky to keep any real amount of money invested in it. That in turn makes it an incredibly weak currency as nobody should want to hold on to it. So it can’t become a real currency until it crashes, and it needs to become a real currency if it wants any hope of not crashing. End result, it’s gonna crash.

">Which means that if a currency is usable today to make purchases, it must also be acceptable to make purchases today that will be paid in the future. Loans and future agreements are stated in monetary terms and that standard of deferred payment is what allows us to buy goods and services today and pay in the future.

This is an important point. The hyper-deflation of bitcoin makes it unusable for loans and future agreements, which are required for any kind of long term economic planning.

You cannot agree to pay someone 500 bitcoin for a project that takes a year to complete, because the value of bitcoin could be radically different by then. You might have to pay 10x as much value, or half, no businesses can operate with that kind of uncertainty.

i can't agree to pay someone enough to buy a car, and then when payment comes I have to pay them enough to buy a house.

This is why everyone still denominates bitcoin in dollars, because whilst 100 bitcoin might be worth radically more or less 6 months from now, $10,000 is going to be worth roughly the same amount minus 0-2% annual inflation.

"You're probably one of those highly learned economists whose best reply to why gold is seen as a store of value is ""because there's always someone there to buy it if the moves down"". 

To go over your dismissals of OP:

1.  The average user doesn't need to understand the technical details. What he needs to understand is that ""having a bitcoin"" is the digital equivalent of ""having a paper dollar"" in the physical world and the ""giving someone your bitcoin"" is the digital equivalent as ""giving your paper dollar"" isn the physical world. Read [this] (https://medium.freecodecamp.org/explain-bitcoin-like-im-five-73b4257ac833). Once you  realize this simple truth, it's very easy to understand why noone can give you back your stolen bitcoin or ""rewind the transaction"" or whatever. It's also easy to understand that your bitcoin is lost once someone gets a hold of your wallet. Your money is gone in the digital world just as in the physical.

2. Yes, bitcoin is tamperproof and completely unforgeable. User failure is not a failure of the system/network. To get back to the digital/physical parallels... If you lose your wallet with your USD, is that somehow a failure of the money? Or if you accidentally throw your cash in fire? Or if it gets eaten up by mice? Comparing bitcoin safety to how your money is safe in a bank is completely preposterous.

3. Bitcoin tx fees are terrible at the moment. This is where bitcoin is a victim of its own success and the tech has fallen behind demand. However solutions are coming. And lightning is a solution. I agree that there are tradeoffs to using lightning - the major one that it will definitely bring some centralization with it (hubs). But this doesn't devalue the bitcoin network in any way. I imagine keeping most of the funds in a conventional wallet and using some of them to fund a channel. Why is that a bad thing? Centralization in this aspect and concerning a limited amount of funds I chose to lock up in a channel doesn't affect any of the qualities that bitcoin gives me - namely decentralization, which is the prerequisite to resistance to censorship and ensuring a neutral vehicle for transferring wealth.

4. This gets brought up a lot, but i don't agree with this point. I've never in my life made a decision on whether to spend my money by thinking about inflation, or ""i better get this now, beacuse I won't be able to afford it next year"". I'm talking strictly about ""operating expenses"" not ""investments"" - of course you try to get rid of your fiat money by buying some assets for investment purposes, but the point you're trying to make revolves around day-to-day purchases (pizzas) not investments. Is forcing people into consumership and having them buy crap they don't really need what's keeping the economy up? If yes, is that really sound and sustainable + an argument against bitcoin?

5. and 6. Is completely dependent on social convention - meaning it all depends on what we agree upon. The more people have bitcoin, the broader this consensus becomes. Once a social consensus among a bigger group (critical mass) is reached, the price/value fluctuations will calm down and your points will be moot. You're basically saying ""it's not a store of value, because it's not a store of value"" and a logical fallacy as such. Again. Why is gold a better store of value than bitcoin? 


> Transaction fees, energy usage due to mining, validation waits, Wallet protection, and exchange with existing monetary infrastructure - all of these things are lacking in fundamental, unfixable ways.

Complete bullshit.  


 Transaction fees: use onchain txs for moving bigger amounts, then fees are workable even at current network status. Offchain for smaller payments. How is this ""unfixable"" and ""lacking in fundamental ways"".  


Wallet protection: for general public - hardware wallets (and check onscreen what address you're sendign to). For advanced users - electrum cold storage/offline tx signing (explained [here](http://docs.electrum.org/en/latest/coldstorage.html) ). *Mic drop*  


Validation waits - again. Non-issue with lightning. Wait 10 mins when you pay for a house. What's the issue here? Even 0 confirmation payments for smaller amounts are hardly an issue  - example: a customer uses his phone with Mycelium and pays for a grocery purchase. You can't even attempt a double spend with Mycelium which means the user would have to run out of the store and use another wallet to attempt a double-spend, all before his original tx is included in a block.   


Energy usage - this is a ""necessary evil"", but it's like that with everything. Christmas light? Watching cat videos with your computer? Sporting events with thousands of lights, cameras, transmitions? Playing hockey in Arizona? We might as well go back to the stone age and not use electricity...  


Exchange with existing monetary infrastructure - this is not a bitcoin network issue, but it is an issue concerning bitcoin. Exchanges should be appropriately regulated - meaning fund insurance, regular audits of security measures, transparency requirements, etc. Andreas Antononpolous has addressed this issue in his canadian senate hearing which was held way back in 2014.   



I am sceptical of the whole ""bringing down the corrupt powers"" mantra that sometimes accompanies bitcoin topics.

"You are debunking OPs post using the current state of Bitcoin disregarding, and I'm not going to assume malicious intent here, that Bitcoin is in continuous development and not considered finished or ready for mass adoption. Bitcoin has been ""debunked"" by all sorts of people since its inception and time and time again Bitcoin made those specialists the laughing stock.
 >Easy to use and understand by everyone - Why would you even set yourself up for this? ""What is Bitcoin"" ""how does Bitcoin work"" ""How do I get a bitcoin"" These are some of the most asked questions on the internet because nobody can grok Bitcoin on the first try, and even when they do, it's not clear to them how they can ""buy in"".  
  
When the internet first appeared nobody thought my grandma  would be able to use an email account.  Any new technology and as complex as Bitcoin takes time till its simplified for everyone. But bitcoin is easy to use and understand now for all technically inclined people willing to spend a few hours studying it.
  
> Tamperproof such that it resists corruption of the original signal - While at first bluff this is true, tamperproof is really just one element of a larger desire that malicious third parties can't change the debt record in their favor. From a purely technical standpoint Bitcoin should be resistant to this, but in practice, the number of coins lost to negligent storage, Wallet exploits, etc. puts this point squarely against BTC.  
  
Things you do not understand are indeed scary. The problems you mention like lost coins and noname wallet exploits are not Bitcoin problems just as a robbed bank is not a problem of the fiat currency. 
  
> I am much, MUCH less concerned that my US bank account will disappear due to some technical trapdoor, or compromised because somebody hacked into the computer systems at my credit union.   
  
Banks get hacked all the time due to technical problems (you are not affected due to insurance) however over the course of the history bank accounts were robbed by the state and you should be concerned as we have recent examples. Just because it didn't happen to you dosen't mean it won't.  
> Negligible in overhead costs - Bitcoin is ludicrously expensive to transact in, and circumventing this via, e.g. the Lightning network, necessarily involves tradeoffs against other technical qualities that you will doubtless be counting for Bitcoin elsewhere.  
  
A 1 million dollar transfer from US to China costs $0.50, never in the entire history has there been something so cheap. The lightning network has no technical trade-offs but given that is even more complex than Bitcoin which seems hard for you to grasp I have doubts regarding your ability of passing such judgments.   

 > Medium of exchange - worthless. Nobody wants to buy pizzas with Bitcoin, because it is by and large considered some kind of investment. I love the irony that people don't want to spend their bitcoin to buy things because they're convinced that it's so incredibly useful to buy things - so much so that it will one day net them millions of... dollars? No wait, not that!  
  
Thats funny because people have bought pizzas with Bitcoin and while currently its not cheap given a scaling solution being implemented they will again.  

> It is completely untrustworthas lost 90% of its purchasing power in the last 100 years and in the last 10 years Bitcoin rose from 0 to $16k while all hy as a store of value - putting money into Bitcoin is not safe. This entire sub has ""invest responsibly"" posts slathered all over it because even the most foolhardy zealots realize that that saying you should save your life's earnings in Bitcoin is a terrible idea. If I had $20 in a bank account in 2008, when I took it out today, it would only be worth 87% of what it was then. Inflation does hurt you over long periods of time, but this was a smooth, monotonic decay. It's the kind of value you can quite literally bank on decades in advance. Bitcoin has no such assurances. The value of your life savings denominated in Bitcoin changes significantly every day.   
 
Also true its the fact that the US dollar other currencies are going down every day. You are right that Bitcoin has no assurances because ""no assurance"" is better than being sure of being slowly robbed.  
  
>   A standard of value - The fact that people's biggest concern is how many dollars one can buy with their Bitcoin tells you everything you need tovknow. Nobody denominates values in Bitcoin - it would be completely useless. If I told you this car was worth 1 BTC, that means two different things on Monday vs. Friday. If I tell you it's worth $15000, you understand.  
  
You are right that if something as new as Bitcoin is not used by now by the entire world as a measure of unit it means it never will. /s  

>The shorthand for all of this is to ask yourself: if you could wake up tomorrow to a world that had replaced all existing monetary infrastructure, would you REALLY want to? Millions of truck drivers with unsecured wallets, policeman's pensions sitting on the blockchain, Starbucks waiting 5 minutes to confirm that your $5 coffee (+ $5 settlement fee) can be handed over? 3 transactions per second for the entire world?  
  
You really hit the nail on the head with this one. By the time your scenario happens none of Bitcoin's difficulties would've been solved. /s

"Despite your hand waving ; inflation is a simple tool to steal from the poor and give to the rich. As you say it encourages investment away from dollars; which is fine for those who have excess wealth. They can take advantage of investing their money and typically hold very little fiat. The poor and working class don't often have enough excess fiat to make investments. So whole their wages stick ; inflation ticks away. 

This whole idea of monetary policy having any positive effect on the global economy is a circle jerking farce. Economists only believe this because they haven't completely destroyed the economy with their fetish for the illusion of control. They haven't been able to destroy the economy only because we have been living through the greatest increases in productivity humanity has ever witnessed. 

What they don't tell you is that every fiat currency has ended in ruin on average in 20years. Destroying the savings and lives of all those foolish enough to drink the koolaid . The oldest fiat in the world is only 100years old; the great British pound. The oldest money in the world is gold and is still recognized as money today ; even without being backed by a government. 

Economies don't need economists to run ; economists are a threat to a healthy free market. All they do is create inefficiency and suffering. Look at Venezuela; look at Zimbabwe; look at history .

"Agreed. No one spends bitcoin. Forgot to mention that amongst all the others I listed in my argument:

 I find it hard to argue any of those points *for* bitcoin:


> 1) easy to use and understand by everyone.

  -  Nope. When grandma got cryptolocked it was 1 week later before she got through to me. And its getting harder and harder to use as the blockchain gets bigger. Hardly anyone has their own wallet unless you're happy to download 150GB of data, growing +50Gb every year (grows by more each year)

>  2) tamperproof such that it resists corruption of the original signal.

 -  Cryptography is tamper proof. BUt thats blockchain. Not bitcoin. Bitcoin is SO hungry on reources its actually led to its weakness (having to fork), and the REASON why litecoins have come about. And as a currency its incredibly easy to manipulate. DDOS affects pricing, as does exchange hacks, and artificial trading (the back and forth that exchanges do to fluff up their trade numbers. IMO its why it will fail

>3)  neglegible in overhead costs

- Wow.So NO. Uses up more energy than most African countries, and the dream of peer-to-peer microtransaction was lost a long time ago. Good luck getting a transaction confirmed within hours unless you pay significant overhead.

Dont get me wrong I love cryptocurrencies, but I seriously have my doubts Bitcoin has staying power, and believe its easily replaceable with one that stands up in every way to those 3 factors.

"The issue is that spent money doesn't necessarily equal created value. People end up throwing away money on stuff of little genuine value which has staggering external costs, instead of making more careful choices, when legal tender is inflationary. This notion of economic prosperity being measured in the total number of goods moved rather than the total *net* useful value of goods moved is wrong thinking derived from a broken paradigm of consumerism that's destroying the planet. More consumption does not create the best society, particularly given the level of health and economic consequences that are now being caused by pollution created from making all of this useless crap that people buy. If people are more hesitant to spend money, then it forces businesses to make products that actually have more valuable benefit to people relative to the true cost of production.

edit: to clarify, I don't think doing away with fiat legal tender is what needs to happen. I just think having the prime currency as fundamentally *inflationary* is damaging, within the context of current currency, economic, and environmental conditions.

"As someone interested in Austrian economics I can only agree. But there are a few things I'd like to comment on:

Easy to use and understand: Does money signal data if people are not sure what the money is? Is bitcoin really a unit of measurement now or merely a speculative good? I believe that, in due time, it can assume a role where it strictly communicates economic data, but at the moment it is itself economic data (due to speculation) and how would an agent be able to distinguish between it signalling speculation and it signalling market data?

Tamperproof and resists the corruption of the original signal: True. But do people know this? Either way, this is what I consider the main benefit of cryptocurrencies. People often do not realize that non representative currencies, i.e., fiat, disturb signals of economic data since its capacity to function as a measurement unit is disrupted by governments increasing supply in an unpredictable way.

"Hey, i wanna give a short  answer as an economist Student myself. I did my bachelor-thesis about cryptocurrencies 2 years ago. I tried to argue if Bitcoin could indeed bei Seen as money and replace out current banking system. And the Definition of money meets 2 points that Bitcoin does not. Money should be able to be used for counting and calculating how mutch Different things cost. The volatility of Bitcoin makes this really Hard. Shops would Need to Change their prices conctantly to meet the fluctuating value of Bitcoin.      And the second point of my research was also due to Bitcoins volatiliy. Money should be able to Store value over time with high certanty. With the current System you might lose 2% due to Inflation but you can be certain about What you can buy in 2 years from now. With Bitcoin you cant. Maybe in will have just crashed and  it need to recover first to your planed value Or i will be factor 100 above What you planed (that would be no Problem indeed).   But still until it will stsbilize bitcoin is not a Good alternative to money.   Bitcoin still awesome thow.

"Title talks of journalists shortcomings but text is all economic theory. 

Re: Journalists: this is a critical issue that deserves critical analysis. Talking heads on Bloomberg and CNBC and those writing for CNN Money play a crucial role in shaping public perception. During this adoption phase, perception is creating reality. 

Normally their role is helpful in determining what is news and then summarizing the issues. In the case of Bitcoin they have gone off the tracks. Especially in the last couple weeks. Their subject knowledge shows they have never visited this sub. Coverage is superficial and almost universally dismissive. 

What has had a huge impact is not the quality of coverage, but the quantity. Bloomberg has a Bitcoin piece every quarter hour. They constantly show hockey stick charts, give awe struck recitations of percentage gains, and run screen bottom tickers of “Bitcoin mania”. This is driving millennials to the App Store where they made coinbase the top download. To them, this is about easy money from an app. 

Coinbase, of course, charges a hefty premium for this video game like convenience. 5 to 10 % price premium and 4% purchase fees. But imagine the reaction if there’s a major price correction. All those millennials will think they were cheated. Headlines will attract attention seeking politicians. Regulations will be promulgated and haphazardly enforced. This can’t be good.

Beautiful. This post touches on a concept that has become clearer and clearer to me lately: money is just a tool of measurement. Traditionally, money had a physical manifestation (shells, gold etc.) This was necessary but also its greatest weakness. It became a 'thing' to be coveted and fought over. Bitcoin is an advancement over traditional forms of money precisely because it is not backed by any 'thing'!;31;5;False;yehongjun;dr2d1i0;"Bitcoin exposes the massive economic illiteracy of financial journalism; arm yourselves with knowledge.";7iyej5;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7iyej5/bitcoin_exposes_the_massive_economic_illiteracy/

"A sad reality is that this is true of almost any specific subject within journalism.

Any time I've had even a low level of education in something it becomes clear the journalists covering that topic only have a passing interest in it, so that they can get an article out and get paid for their job. Or maybe the editors dumb them down, I don't know the inner workings of it.

Seriously - study any specific topic for a week. Then read a recent article on that topic. 90% chance the article is fundamentally wrong.

It's hard to blame the individual journos for it. They're trying to make a living. They're trained in journalism not computer science/physics/finance/whatever. So they write articles that are cogent and understandable for the majority of the readers. That's their job.

There are exceptions and I'm thankful those journos and their editors/publishers exist but there is no one publication that stands up. It's usually individual well educated journos who only post on a very limited range of subjects with publishers/editors who either support them or can't be bothered filtering them beyond maybe the title on their articles.

"OP may or may not be a an economist but he doesn't properly define the functions of money/currency. 

1. A currency must serve as a medium of exchange, which means that the currency acts as an intermediary between buyers and sellers. To serve as a medium of exchange, a currency must be very widely accepted as a method of payment in the markets for goods, labor, and financial capital. 

2. A currency must serve as a store of value. However, it does not need to be a PERFECT store of value because normal currencies are expected to be subject to inflation. It must not have wild swings in value. 

3. A currency must be able to serve as a unit of account, which means that it is the ruler by which other values are measured. A currency acts a common denominator, an accounting method that simplifies thinking about trade-offs.

4. A currency must serve as a standard of deferred payment. Which means that if a currency is usable today to make purchases, it must also be acceptable to make purchases today that will be paid in the future. Loans and future agreements are stated in monetary terms and that standard of deferred payment is what allows us to buy goods and services today and pay in the future. 

Edit: to any interested here is a link to an excellent free intro to econ textbook created by rice university. I literally took this list of functions out of chapter 29: Money and Banking.

"“Freer, fairer society”. 

According to Bloomberg, 1,000 people own 40% of the bitcoin market. 

Your entire argument is moot because Bitcoin is not appropriate to be used freely in society. It’s being hoarded by a few people and at much worse rate than the US Dollar is today. 

Also if you were an economist you’d understand for a currency to be adopted it also needs to be realistically accessible to anyone and can be used quickly and conveniently enough to process transactions. A devaluing currency can’t be easily adopted and there are crypto currencies that respond to transactions faster than bitcoin. 

Invest in bitcoin if you want but this gatekeeping and holier than thou attitude is hilarious.

"Great post, I have a YouTube channel Art of the Problem and I've been slaving away on a Bitcoin Video script to illuminate people for months now...I realized that 95% of the understanding is knowing how money emerges, and 5% of it is the protocol.

A few other thoughts 

1. The first ""money"" was simply a promise of future value (IOU)
2. Human memory is weak so once we started writing we wrote down a list of who owes who what, i.e. a leder (first cuneiform documents are ledgers!)
3. The reason why money also began taking physical form (via treasures or collectibles such as shells) is because it works well when you *cross trust boundaries* (IOU's don't hold water when you go visit another tribe...they are no longer ""transferable"" - also treasures work well when you cross long periods in time (passing treasures for inheritance)

So money is ""transferable credit"" and within a family of trusted people we don't need physical tokens for it (a ledger works fine) -  physical money is a way to make it trustless when you trade across cultures/tribes.

way later in history we ended up back with 'digital money' (i.e. 95% of money is just a ledger) which is protected/controlled/monitored by 3rd party. 

And so the missing problem we always had is ""how can we we send value along a communication channel without a trusted third party""...that's what the Bitcoin paper addresses.

One other thing I wanted to throw out there when it comes to the protocol.

When explaining to a layperson, I would say that bitcoin takes the great feature (of flaw for some people) of the internet (information can't be stopped) and turns it into a security advantage - if we tell everyone to copy a file, then it's impossible to ""stop""....but the KEY is how can we know which copy of the file is the real copy? The answer is simple - we ask everyone in the network to VOTE on which is the real copy, and the majority vote is the copy we attribute truth to.

that democratic aspect I think people can understand.

of course there are many other details, but I just wanted to dump some ideas

SegWit is a collection of fixes to the bitcoin protocol of which usage in transaction is promoted to encourage bitcoin scaling. It is not a fix to to overhead costs, and was never designed for it. The Lightning Network is.

I feel that this post heavily rests on confirmation bias. Bitcoin has massive hurdles to pass yet, most prominent of which are scaling (many orders of magnitudes) and government interference. As time progresses the latter will become less likely, and several solutions have been postulated for the former.

"It’s truly hard for me to believe that any economist would really say something about currency like “representing economic data”. No, that is certainly not where the value of currencies or the value of any sorts of cryptocurrencies comes from. (Or pardon me if I have been ignorant on Econ papers) It is also really hard for me to believe that any economist would believe the failure of modern currency and banking system. Just imagine the failure of USD GBP EURO etc. No offence, it just won’t happen. However, bitcoin is a hint and also the technology to change the current system and the change is already happening. Let me just elaborate a little about my thinking on bitcoin.

All assets come with underlying values or a raw source of real economic value. For example. Stocks give you the value from dividends and ownership. Options are attached to some underlying assets like stocks or some indices. You cannot have futures without having some underlying assets with economic meaning such as cotton. This applies to currencies and cryptocurrencies as well. Currencies as a very very very special type of asset can have a value because they represent some economic value within some economy. For example, USD is a strong currency, because it is used to represent economic value in the US, which is backed up by the giant volume of American economy. Similarly, Euros is another important currency since it is used in the Europe, which is the other most economically developed place in this world. From what I can understand based on common sense and the simplest economic theories, Bitcoin should also follow this logic, if it is a “currency” representing economic value. That is: its value is based on the top of the economy it represents (not the “economic data”). As a currency, it has to be used as a ruler/measure of economic values in real world. To support the high nominal price of bitcoin, that proportion of economy which uses bitcoin has to be a good match of its price. However, we do not see that foundation to back up its value. This is also why governments all over the world do not define bitcoin as “currency” besides political reasons. Economically, it is just not a currency at least at this moment.

Bitcoin may have a future. The fact that is troubling people (like myself) who are willing to believe the future of bitcoin is that it has a such high price at this moment without having a big share of economy to represent. In other words, very few people use bitcoin as a ruler/measure of economic value. I believe most bitcoin holders have not bought or sold anything with this “future measure of value”. Please let me know if you use bitcoin to take bus/subways, get lunch and buy groceries or if you are getting paid by your employer with bitcoin. The bitcoin may have a real player seat against other real-world currencies in the future. But if the speculation dominates the future of bitcoin, bitcoin is not going anywhere. Since the first very simple fundamental requirement for any asset to be a measure of economic value is to have a stable price. Look at the fiat currencies, it is called deflation if the price of whatever paper bill goes up significantly. It is called inflation if you have to use 100 dollars in the future to purchase whatever you can purchase with 10 dollars today. The design of the bitcoin is experimental. It does not have the power at this moment to represent the magnitude of the world economy’s volume. 

On the other hand, if you think about the current status of the modern banking system. Isn’t it providing a complete digitalized easy way to transfer money, to make purchases or to do whatever a normal person would like to do on a daily basis? On a daily basis, people use credit card, apple pay, sumsung pay, paypal, vemno, wechat wallet, alipay and the list goes on and on. If you tell me bitcoin settles faster. Ok. Yet, the settlement speed is a technical issue not an economic issue. If you tell me that bitcoin is a more secure way to make transactions. Ok, the modern currency and banking system has been existing for centuries. Yet, bitcoin just reached a decade. From seashell to metals, from metals to only gold and silver, from gold and silver to coins and paper bills attached to the gold’s intrinsic value. The security of this modern currency and banking system is tested throughout the history of human beings’ existence. Or you may mention the technological security, yes right blockchain. Don’t you think the giant banks can easily set up a privately functional blockchain system fully under a proper regulation to improve their current technological security? Blockchain is just a distributed ledger system or you can view it as a distributed data storage like any other data warehouse systems whether its SQL, Hadoop or whatever. Also, anything written in computer programing language is highly likely to have bugs/loopholes as long as it is long enough. 

As a matter of fact, bitcoin currently is just a very good way to hide values for transactions that cannot be shown to the public and the transactions that do not stand by our universal values. Imagine a world, politicians hide their illegal profits using bitcoin. Drugs and other criminal activities cannot be traced because the transactions go anonymously. Imagine that type of world where human trafficking happens more often and sex slaves are very easy to sell. I’m not sure what is really worse than these consequences about letting banks to record all your legal transactions and money transfers. Yet, these are the current impact of bitcoin. All traceable transactions became untraceable, which does not benefit the people living peaceful life.

Now back to the point of what is the real value of bitcoin at this moment: the best explanation of the existence of bitcoin is that it somehow acts as a medium to temporarily store values, and it also gives the risk-loving and ambiguity-loving type of people the chance to bet against each other. In other words, bitcoin is more like commodities in this sense. The difference is that most commodities have their own real-world use. For instances, People make t-shirts with cotton and feed animals with corn products. However, the real-world use of bitcoin is for transactions but this real-world use is nearly negligible. Most people do not “exchange” their USD/GBP/EURO/RMB/YEN to bitcoin so that they can use the bitcoin to make purchases. People often compare bitcoin with gold in some sense. But there is a significant difference between bitcoin and gold. Gold was once the most prevalent currency around the world (silver as the same). The paper bills appear initially to represent gold(or silver). To unify the different privately labeled paper bills, the government backed paper bills show up. Even now the most powerful paper bill the USD is somehow related to the value of gold. The US also has the largest gold reserve in the world. 

Until the volume of transactions goes up significantly (and it won’t if the volatility remains the same), the bitcoin will have little to none fundamental value to explain its high price. So bitcoin is just a bit like commodities, providing just the chance to trade/gamble.  Will you buy bitcoin if it is a real currency? My guess is not. Switching between EURO and USD does not really help you get anything if you are not a forex trader. If you really choose not to hold bitcoin for just a very small tiny nominal price change VS USD/fiat currencies, you are not really valuing its future being a currency.

"The lesson in your post is important. I think you should attribute equal focus to the fact that this very point also exposes the fact that not only bitcoin can solve the problems aforementioned, which fiat is inadequate at solving. The underlying technology Bitcoin uses, and inspires, however, has much more value. 

Yes, we are at a precipice where the alleged “bubble” may very well be the needle instead. It is paramount to understand though, that we are also at a precipice where technology is reaching into our financial systems in very novel ways for the first time ever. The problems that can be solved with blockchain and tangle technologies are merely the beginning of an even larger change of guard than that of how the financial industry transfers value. The very way value presents itself is actually changing, and taking a massive leap towards creating independent and democratized systems where the common man and woman can access information. Data and the ability to transfer it; whether it be monetary value, informational value, contractual value, or anything that can be translated into the digital realm, is the new currency. 

Bitcoin is important; it’s creating millionaires, and it is also inspiring, but it’s symbolism will be historic in many more ways than just these. It represents great potential for massive financial disruption, and yet is also the first dance of many to come with the usefulness of blockchain technology and the distributed ledger concept.

We will have over 25 billion iot devices in circulation sometime in 2018. This stat is projected to be over 70Bb by 2025 - look back seven years and look at what has changed and now think about what the next seven will bring. Think about the implications of this with today’s common systems and their respective inefficiencies in communicating with each other, and the $’s and time associated with doing so for organizations, governments, and individuals alike. Security, real-time requirements to satiate the humanity’s ever evolving economic thirst for on-demand anything, and the common man and woman’s access to information are all a perfect storm of circumstances to make these technologies staples of our new era. 

We are not witnessing the explosive growth of Bitcoin, we are having an explosive realization that blockchain and similar platforms are needed in order for us to progress. Bitcoin is just a single step in the right direction.

"I dont know I just find it hard to argue any of those points *for* bitcoin:


> 1) easy to use and understand by everyone.

  -  Nope. When grandma got cryptolocked it was 1 week later before she got through to me. And its getting harder and harder to use as the blockchain gets bigger. Hardly anyone has their own wallet unless you're happy to download 150GB of data, growing +50Gb every year (grows by more each year)

>  2) tamperproof such that it resists corruption of the original signal.

 -  Cryptography is tamper proof. BUt thats blockchain. Not bitcoin. Bitcoin is SO hungry on reources its actually led to its weakness (having to fork), and the REASON why litecoins have come about. And as a currency its incredibly easy to manipulate. DDOS affects pricing, as does exchange hacks, and artificial trading (the back and forth that exchanges do to fluff up their trade numbers. IMO its why it will fail

>3)  neglegible in overhead costs

- Wow.So NO. Uses up more energy than most African countries, and the dream of peer-to-peer microtransaction was lost a long time ago. Good luck getting a transaction confirmed within hours unless you pay significant overhead.

Dont get me wrong I love cryptocurrencies, but I seriously have my doubts Bitcoin has staying power, and believe its easily replaceable with one that stands up in every way to those 3 factors.

"It isn't just journalists. People with PHDs in economics, who really should know better, have come out with idiotic critiques against bitcoins like the lack of intrinsic value. To my knowledge, nothing mankind has ever agreed to use for transactions hasn't proceeded outstripped its intrinsic value by a large enough factor to make the difference between that value and 0 mostly irrelevant. The simple fact is that the value of transmitting economic data is far higher than the value of any commodity used to do so. As a result, I suspect a commodity that has no utility outside of transmitting data is actually marginally preferable because it frees up commodities that have other uses to be used.

"Fantastic post.

If you look at it more mechanically, bitcoin has value because speculators predict that the price will go up in the future. Thus, they are willing to trade fiat currency for bitcoin.

This serves as a substitute for ""backing,"" which in the old days referred to paper notes that were redeemable for a fixed amount of a commodity.

Because there is a liquid market to trade bitcoin for fiat money, it's completely possible to use bitcoin to actually *do transactions* for people who are not speculators.

This is a virtuous cycle. Over time the price will stabilize more and more. Futures will be disruptive at first but will eventually help this.

And that, folks, is how you bootstrap a new, decentralized currency. History in the making.

It isn't just journalists. People with PHDs in economics, who really should know better, have come out with idiotic critiques against bitcoins like the lack of intrinsic value. To my knowledge, nothing mankind has ever agreed to use for transactions hasn't proceeded outstripped its intrinsic value by a large enough factor to make the difference between that value and 0 mostly irrelevant. The simple fact is that the value of transmitting economic data is far higher than the value of any commodity used to do so. As a result, I suspect a commodity that has no utility outside of transmitting data is actually marginally preferable because it frees up commodities that have other uses to be used.;0;1;False;fmfwpill;dr2j2yr;"Bitcoin exposes the massive economic illiteracy of financial journalism; arm yourselves with knowledge.";7iyej5;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7iyej5/bitcoin_exposes_the_massive_economic_illiteracy/
Impressed that an economist claims the idea that money needn't be 'backed' by something while the mainstream economists don't.  But money is really backed by something: proof-of-work.  Imagine a parallel universe where the only miner is Satoshi's PC since 2009, the committed energy for a block is so small that everyone on the street can roll back the data and doesn't trust the data in the block therefore.;1;2;False;LucSr;dr2hhpx;"Bitcoin exposes the massive economic illiteracy of financial journalism; arm yourselves with knowledge.";7iyej5;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7iyej5/bitcoin_exposes_the_massive_economic_illiteracy/
"Imagine if crypto currency goes main stream and governments across world start demanding taxes in form of bitcoins. Now, how does this work out?

By definition, there is a limit on number of coins mined. How are common people supposed to pay taxes? Sure, they earn in bitcoins but, government's expenditure is not totally covered by taxes and thus they need to print fiat money (or capture resources). This will result in higher tax rates.

In long run, due to bitcoin being deflationary, the world economy will go into deflation and then the vicious cycle will make sure that the liquidity of coins in market go down since no one wants to spend them in the present in the hope of being able to buy more stuff in future and thus production of stuff goes down since less sales volume. So, effectively, the worst of poor people get left out unable to buy stuff at cheap prices while the rich hoard coins in their wallet and are able to buy all luxury stuff that keeps getting cheaper for them every passing day.

They're illiterate because they're used to the zero-sum-game extraction-based market where value is taken, not created. It's the same reason why outsiders that come into gaming tend to close the studio about a year later. They just don't understand that they're creating value so their decisions instead pick the company to the bone then they jump ship just like they would with any other company once the well dries up. Pretty much the inevitable fate of any publicly traded gaming company.

"You're forgetting the most fundamental point of all. Something you would have noted as bullet point 0 on your list. That point I speak of is *faith*. It is the belief that other people will take my currency and give me something of value that is where a currency derives it's worth first & foremost. Only after a currency holds the belief of the people do your three other astute points matter. Without faith a currency is useless.

Fundamentally speaking all currency is fiat. Yes all currency is fiat. That means Bitcoin and even gold. Being finite in nature doesn't exclude you from said designation. This is because they have no intrinsic value or usefulness in and of themselves. I can not build a shelter out of gold (easily, practically). I can not eat Bitcoin.

"I want to throw out a thought for people to ponder, which really points out the illusion of inherent value of fiat.

Banks work, simply put, by storing your money and lending it out to others. They get interests off loans and pay you interests on your savings. But an interesting thing happens when someone takes up a loan at a bank.

People don't take up loans and then withdraw them in cash; they put the money back into the bank. Think about that. If I put $100 in a bank, the bank will lend that same $100 to someone else, who then then also places that money in the bank in order to use it. With money in their account they can purchase something, transferring to someone else's bank account, but the cash never leaves the bank.

So how much money does the bank actually have? Both me and the guy who took up the loan would claim to have $100 dollars in our savings account, so you'd think the bank would have $200 in cash in their vaults. But no, they only have my $100. They have effectively created money out of thin air, by the use of loans.

I don't remember the name for this, but its a well understood concept and necessary consequence of running a bank. Different countries have different limits to how much money a bank is allowed to ""conjure up"" for every dollar that they store, but my main point is this:

A dollar kept in a bank is ""backed"" by only a fraction of itself.";1;3;False;HugeMongoose;dr2p0zp;"Bitcoin exposes the massive economic illiteracy of financial journalism; arm yourselves with knowledge.";7iyej5;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7iyej5/bitcoin_exposes_the_massive_economic_illiteracy/

"When someone asks what Bitcoins are backed by, I ask what the Pound sterling is backed by, or what the US dollar is backed by.

By 'backed', most people mean 'controlled'. Pounds and dollars are backed by intangible concepts like faith, debt and economy but they are controlled by governments, banks and mints printing more or less of them to keep their economy in check through inflation and interest rates. 

If the inflation rate in the value of BTC is in the thousands of %, so be it, that's what it's worth this year compared to last year. A mathematical formula governs how many BTC's there will be in existence at any one time, the consensus governs how much each one is worth. On the downside, the lack of control allows manipulation by whales for their financial own gains, eventually the big financial institutions will end up controlling the price with complete impunity, not consensus. If someone wanted to dump the price to the floor on the day you want to pull your money out too, you're stuffed.

"/u/Dietsman, congrats on a well thought-out post even though it lacks some fundamentals.

> Money is valuable

Money primarily is a unit of account that is attached to a certain value. 

> A currency, the manifestation of money, is valuable when it does a good job of transferring the aforementioned data by being:

>1) easy to use and understand by everyone

> 2) tamperproof such that it resists corruption of the original signal

> 3) neglegible in overhead costs

That's correct for fiat money, but it's only half of the truth when you talk about Bitcoin.

Bitcoin is a protocol that takes it's value from **Decentralization** and therefore **censorship resistance**. It's a paradigm change that enables all humans to be financially sovereign for the first time in history.

While this is impressing in itself, money is just the first application. There will be many more. 

Think of the (Bitcoin) blockchain, the most secure computer network in the world with ,currently, a $280+billion bounty on it's back. It enables us to immutably prove identity, ownership, birth, death, just anything you can think of.

We as humans will be able to take back our sovereignty and transform from sheeples to free individuals.

People would lead happier lives. Currently, the system Isn't designed for a deflationary currency system because energy, water and food are all monopolised.

"Money is just a token for wealth.

You don't need a deflationary currency to save money because you can just use inflationary money to buy deflationary forms of wealth. What's the point of having a currency that rewards you for not spending it? That's just an asset, and there are already plenty of assets that do exactly the same thing, but they have other uses.

Those assets are forms of wealth and buying them can help generate wealth (i.e. if you buy gold, gold miners get money they can use to mine more gold). Once all 21,000,000 bitcoins are mined, buying a bitcoin won't generate any wealth (because its not wealth), it just transfers it.

Currency only generates wealth by facilitating trading. Too much inflation might push trading past an optimal point, but any amount of deflation necessarily rewards economic inactivity.

The arguments about discouraging savings only applies to actual use of money. Savings only produce value when banks use savings to loan money to people to do productive things. ""savings"" in terms of just burying money in your yard and hoping it increases in value only works by zero-sum transfers from other people. It's not something that should be rewarded.

In fact its much better if you use money to invest in wealth generation rather than just bury your money under a mattress and then reduce the relative money supply to increase the relative value of your money.

I can see an argument for having a 0% inflationary currency (although it would be hard to constantly adjust supply to meet demand without having a central authority), but deflation of a currency just means rewarding people who already have currency at the expense of those who don't.

That was Aristophanes over 2000 years ago.

Gold was never a good currency, people used to hoard gold coins, shave them, clip them, melt them down, because gold was more profitable to hoard than to spend. It kept increasing in value so people would hoard gold coins while using other less deflationary coins as currency. Brass and copper were far more useful coinage. The only reason gold was used was because it was just the only way of moving a large quantity of money easily.

There's a reason every country in the world that was on the gold standard chose to get off it.

">Everybody has to spend money on stuff they need and the deflationary rate is the same for everyone

It's not the same for everyone unless everyone owns exactly the same amount of money and wealth.

If I use a bitcoin to buy some steel to build a factory with, and next week week the value of bitcoin goes up 10x, then someone who waited a week to buy their steel could have either got 10x more or paid 10x less.

if I buy that steel, and the price of bitcoin goes up 10x, and then I try to sell that steel, I will get 10x less than what I paid for it.

The value of the steel hasn't changed, its the relative value of currency. In effect there is a net transfer of value from people who hold wealth to people who hold money.

With this degree of hyper-inflation, value is constantly being transferred from people who have assets to people who just have money. This can make it more profitable just to buy up money rather than to try and do anything productive with it.

It becomes unprofitable to do anything with money unless the returns from using the money are higher than the returns of keeping hold of it. There are very few investments that you can actually get 2x your return in a week.

"value of money is relative to the amount of money and the amount of wealth.

If you keep the amount of money the same and increase the amount of wealth, the relative value of money will increase. If you keep the amount of wealth the same and decrease the amount of money the same thing will happen.

If you have 1 bitcoin for every car in the world, and then double the amount of cars, you now have 1 bitcoin for every two cars, so now 0.5 bitcoins represents every car. This is what people are talking about when they say deflation will discourage trade, because anything you can afford to put off will be more profitable to buy later for as long as the currency deflates. this can trigger a deflationary spiral like in the great depression, where people stop buying, which puts companies out of business, so people stop getting paid, which means they can't buy anything, so even more people go out of business and so on.

this is a super simple explanation, actual market behavior is more complicated but follows the general rule.

So far deflation isn't a problem for bitcoin because people are using it as an investment, no economies are relying on it as a main currency.

Bitcoins are already deflating rapidly even when thousands are produced a week, because the demand for bitcoins is increasing faster than supply. Once no bitcoins are being produced at all, the only way bitcoins price can ever stabilize is if the amount of wealth in the world also stabilizes. And in fact because bitcoins are gradually lost with no recovery method, the only way for it to stabilize would be for the amount of wealth in the world to decrease at the same rate as the amount of bitcoin.

Bitcoin will quickly become hyper-deflationary (even more than the 1000% annual deflation its currently at) as the supply starts to half while demand continues to increase.

"To be honest, the truth being somewhere in the middle is a bromide that glosses over some of the key points that this poster just made. 

I agree that cryptocurrency has some interesting components to it. But if something ever does mature out of this and is successful, it will need to be so different that it essentially would not be bitcoin, and maybe you wouldn't call it cryptocurrency either. They have some major flaws (which the poster highlighted) - chief of which being that they are decentralized, in my opinion - which makes it difficult to keep the value stable and make the currency an effective medium of exchange";1;0;False;bc289;dr3dapl;"Bitcoin exposes the massive economic illiteracy of financial journalism; arm yourselves with knowledge.";7iyej5;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7iyej5/bitcoin_exposes_the_massive_economic_illiteracy/
">Give it 10 - 20 years to mature.

It would be fucking incredible if Bitcoin was still relevant in 20 years time, just as incredible as if we were still using MS-DOS or Netscape Navigator today.

Some cryptocurrency may come out on top but it would be unprecedented if it was the very first one to market. Tech is highly innovative which is why market leaders get dethroned so often. Once a software/company gets huge it becomes much less responsive. We can already see this with bitcoin. It's taking years to get consensus on even the most simplest revisions to the protocol, whilst smaller cryptos are innovating rapidly.

All this is to say I'm very skeptical of the idea that bitcoin is valuable not because of rampant price speculation (of which the evidence is overwhelming), but because its definitely going to be the currency of the future that replaces all other currency.

There's a very good chance bitcoin is worthless 20 years from now, which destroys the idea that current value is based on future utility.";4;0;False;suninabox;dr34sys;"Bitcoin exposes the massive economic illiteracy of financial journalism; arm yourselves with knowledge.";7iyej5;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7iyej5/bitcoin_exposes_the_massive_economic_illiteracy/

Which is odd because the vast majority of the demand for bitcoin is coming from people in the 1st world who are looking to get rich off speculation, not poor africans.

Less than 1,000 own nearly 20% of all bitcoins there are.

>Have you ever brought a backpack of USD to another country and sold them for a 30-40% premium?

the mark up on bitcoins is far higher than that, which is a bad argument if you're saying that the problem with US dollars is that they're expensive for people in poor countries to buy.

Deflation in Zimbabwe is a significant problem since they switched to the USD dollar and struggled to get enough supply to meet demand. I'm not sure why you think a hyper-deflationary currency is the answer.

No one in Zimbabwe is using bitcoin as a currency. If everyone was using bitcoin as currency there would be no demand for USD and other currencies.

"No. The federal reserve 100% caused the financial crisis. You only think they ""fixed it"" because they've merely kicked the can down the road, once again. How? By keeping the interest rate absurdly low for much too long. Our entire banking system has become dependant on cheap access to money. When the interest rate is suppressed, banks tend to make more bad loans in attempts to find more ROI. Entire industries arise which are dependent on cheap access to money.

In 2006, the Fed attempted to increase the interest rate and the economy, which had been built on bad loans, reacted by experiencing withdrawal systems in 2008. Instead of letting the economy go through a needed recovery cycle, we're back to incredible levels of irresponsible debt, both private and public, caused by near ZERO interest rates and by astronomical levels of currency creation. The only thing the Fed fixed is the illusion that the economy and banking system is healthy. One more recession and the Fed will ""fix"" the economy by pushing rates into the negatives.

cryptocurrency is UNCENSORED MONEY (nobody controls it, or needs to know who is on each side of the transaction) like cash but in virtual form.

"> As Bitcoin grows... it becomes more stable 

I'm not an economist, but the stability of a currency also seems to me to be something of real importance. And that means both in terms of potential inflation or deflation (one condition unfairly rewards the borrower, the other the lender; one the employer, the other the employee; one the buyer, the other the seller; etc.). And I'm not sure I find your arguments here convincing. Bitcoin seems by design to be strongly deflationary, and designed to remain so even after something approaching equilibrium is reached.

But a more important reason I still have some doubts about Bitcoin is the way it is being distributed - by benefiting  only the people who buy in early, entirely at the expense of those who buy in late.

"Bitcoin is designed to be hyper-deflationary, it can never stabilize.

right now bitcoins are being produced at the fastest rate they will ever be, and its still woefully insufficient to meet the demands of less than 1% of the worlds population who are not even using bitcoin on a daily basis but are mainly just irregularly buying and holding and occasionally cashing out.

The supply rate of bitcoin is going to half in the near future, and then half again, until supply drops to absolute 0. In fact supply rate will reverse long before the last bitcoin mined since coins are gradually lost over time with no recovery mechanism.

All the while more and more of the population are supposed to be adopting bitcoin. People who prophesize bitcoin will replace all fiat somehow think demand is supposed to go from less than 1% of the population to 100%, at the same time the supply rate is actually going down, not up, and there not be catastrophic hyper-deflation.

Be it capitalism, socialism or communism - all will happily annihilate the other to protect their privileged positions and financial interests. 

Now, if Bitcoin were to start making such inroads to seriously disrupt actual fiat value - wouldn’t the world’s major capitalist governments (the G-8 or G-20 nation members) literally fight this tooth & nail? I mean straight out outlawing it by revoking trading licences of exchanges, criminalising receiving Bitcoin (or other cryptos) by retailers? 

If it really does become the real deal - won’t the majority of law abiding citizens drop it immediately and stay the fuck away from anything that’ll piss the government off?

"One thing I’ve never seen mentioned is how although bitcoin isn’t tangible it very much has characteristic of a ‘thing’ that is real and must be protected. When you obtain a bitcoin you own its private key, which is what gives it its value, makes it unique and makes it similar to a file on your computer where if you lose it or destroy it then it’s gone. Similar to an object in the physical word. 

Whenever I hear people say bitcoin isn’t something real, I have to disagree. Private keys are absolutely real and without them there is no bitcoin.

"Regarding point number one, why can’t bitcoin live next to traditional currencies instead of replacing them. A unique feature of bitcoin for transactions is that it can instantly translate for the current exchange rate.  I don’t see bitcoin replacing fiat currency any time soon, but I do see it living right next to it as a way to convert to any currency as needed on the fly. Shops don’t need to price in bitcoins.  They price in the local currency and bitcoin automatically converts to the current exchange rate. It facilitates digital transmission of fiat currency for a digital world, ideally without the fees that encumber other digital transactions.

"Good points. I'll throw in some things I've tossed around internally and also vocally in the past few months.

**1** Since the creation of the first electronic bit, data has been freely and easily replicable. This underlies the ""information seeks to be free"" movement because that movement views this copyability as an inherent part of each bit. Billions of dollars have been spent devising and implementing systems like DRM and license management servers specifically to restrict this inherent copyability. The reason these are clunky is because they fight against the very nature of bits themselves.

What Bitcoin does is it brings the world of atoms and the world of bits together for the first time. This goes back to Nicholas Negroponte's essays in the mid-90s on bits vs. atoms. Atoms are scarce, bits are not, therefore as the philosophy goes any attempt to restrict bits is a fundamental violation of the nature of bits and the Internet and is doomed to fail. History has generally shown that to be true.

But since Bitcoin brings the scarcity of atoms to the world of bits, we can now leverage *all* the inherent copyability of bits without losing any of the scarcity of atoms. Doing this brings economics natively into the world of bits for the first time. We can use all the power of all the tools that can work with bits and transfer value at the speed of light without being bottlenecked by the need to convert those bits back into atoms somehow at each endpoint. (i.e. to convert them into withdrawn dollars after a bank transfer, etc) 

Bitcoin has separated the *economic utility* of atoms from the *friction* of using atoms.

**2** Blockchains in general can massively alter the nature of how we trust. Currently we transmit trust across a social graph with a discount -- for each person/institution between us the trust we transitively propagate to each other is eroded by this discount factor. Eventually it reaches zero or near enough to be effectively zero, and we no longer trust anyone beyond that point.

Blockchains (such as Bitcoin) replace these multiple hops with a single hop -- the software and blockchain -- which we all trust by virtue of participating in the network. Therefore the trust discount factor essentially remains constant and no erosion occurs. So now you can transitively trust anyone on the network equally, with no intermediaries required.";21;3;False;doc_samson;dr2l06h;"Bitcoin exposes the massive economic illiteracy of financial journalism; arm yourselves with knowledge.";7iyej5;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7iyej5/bitcoin_exposes_the_massive_economic_illiteracy/

"Half of his arguments are completly wrong though.

> Tamperproof such that it resists corruption of the original signal - While at first bluff this is true, tamperproof is really just one element of a larger desire that malicious third parties can't change the debt record in their favor. From a purely technical standpoint Bitcoin should be resistant to this, but in practice, the number of coins lost to negligent storage, Wallet exploits, etc. puts this point squarely against BTC. I am much, MUCH less concerned that my US bank account will disappear due to some technical trapdoor, or compromised because somebody hacked into the computer systems at my credit union.

The point of tamperproof completly goes over his head. You cant fake Bitcoin but you can fake any fiat currency.

> It is completely untrustworthy as a store of value - putting money into Bitcoin is not safe. This entire sub has ""invest responsibly"" posts slathered all over it because even the most foolhardy zealots realize that that saying you should save your life's earnings in Bitcoin is a terrible idea. If I had $20 in a bank account in 2008, when I took it out today, it would only be worth 87% of what it was then. Inflation does hurt you over long periods of time, but this was a smooth, monotonic decay. It's the kind of value you can quite literally bank on decades in advance. Bitcoin has no such assurances. The value of your life savings denominated in Bitcoin changes significantly every day.

Tell that to the people of Cyprus, Greece and India...

> Medium of exchange - worthless. Nobody wants to buy pizzas with Bitcoin, because it is by and large considered some kind of investment. I love the irony that people don't want to spend their bitcoin to buy things because they're convinced that it's so incredibly useful to buy things - so much so that it will one day net them millions of... dollars?

There is a chance it just bounces around 15k for the next few years. It most likely will continue to climb. There is a chance it pops and plummets but its not a guarantee as so many think it is. ;1;0;False;Spinal365;dr2kdee;Bitcoin Plummets To Levels Unseen Since December 6, 2017!;7irvkt;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7irvkt/bitcoin_plummets_to_levels_unseen_since_december/

"> Everyone popping in here has no idea what bitcoin is, throwing money at it talking about getting rich

That's for sure.  I was in a forum this week where the guy was legitimately complaining about a 10% week.  It jolted me!  I had to remind myself that there are huge numbers of people invested in BTC who know NOTHING.  And they're all circle jerking about HOLD NO MATTER WHAT.  Geez.

For some reason people CANNOT grasp this idea:  If you sell out 30 minutes, 3 months, a year, 2 years, whatever, before the fear/capitulation phase of your graphic, then you're fine.  Just as you did, they will tuck away a nice little profit.  But if you're ONE HOUR late, it's too late.  It's over.  They all seem to think they'll be the ones to ""see it coming"" and liquidate just before the floor falls out.  They also haven't anticipated an environment where there are NO BIDS!!!!  That's what fear/capitulation is!  It's an environment where the floor falls out and there is 1 small buyer and an avalanche of millions of sell orders.

I will quietly buy some coins in the ""despair"" phase sometime in the future.  Just as I did during the housing collapse when I was buying up stock at DOW 8K and everyone was telling me I was INSANE, ""this is no time to buy, everyone's selling"".

21 hours later and Bitcoin is sitting at:  $16,916.20

I expect it'll continue upward at least for a while, maybe for some time.  So as predicted, just a bump on the road.

EDIT: Yep, here we are, almost at the one week reminder, and Bitcoin is sitting at $19,497.40.  How thoroughly unpredictable! :D

"I will help clarify.  You used the word ""Every"".  Every does't just refer to one, or even to many, but to ALL.  Every. This is its standard usage.  I referred to a single instance. I have no doubt Bitcoin's price will correct far lower than its all-time high.  I don't think we've reached it yet.  So I am not saying that ""every dip will continue moving up"", I am simply stating, which is obvious on its face, that there is a strong chance, given recent history and current climate, that THIS dip will continue moving up. 

I'm not endorsing the coin, its future, or its ability to take over the world, or giving recent investors a guarantee of success.  I'm saying I feel its likely they'll be happy in a week's time, and their paper losses will be either negligible, or turned into gains, in a week.

I don't deal in absolutes, because so few can be known. I just dial it back 7.  No need for 11. :)

"Back in 2007 I had a TV show I had acquired by sailing the seven seas burnt onto a DVD. It was about three episodes in before she noticed there were no AD's playing. She asked why there were none, I explained how I had acquired such a dvd.

Fast forward a couple months and we're out shopping for a laptop for college in a very large retail outlet. I find my mom talking to the sales associate about how I'm so good with computers that I can download entire TV shows and put them on DVD's to watch. The retail lady's eyes grew very big.

My mom turned around ""AH! pcharger! Here he is. He can put all these movies and shows on DVD! Darling, this lady here was talking about wanting some DVDs, she wrote her number down here. Do you think you could contact her later, she was saying she could pay you for them.""
