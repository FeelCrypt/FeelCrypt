"Idk if you are aware but there are currencies with fixed rate. Another example is Saudi Arabia (at least when I worked there). Legally the exchange rate was 3.75 Per USD. 
How does that work, bevsue the government buys enough to keep the supply demand curve at that specific point. 

Countries with primary resource exports also sometimes try to fix their exchange rate by using the money they get from export to exchange for their own currency making it float at a certain point. If you end up with less money, it's harder and you have to depreciate your currency (allow it to be devalued to a new point).

"I think you are giving much more credibility to the idea of a “free floating rate”. If economic data in the US weren’t manipulated then they would not strip out food and gas from inflation data. These are the two main cost of ones paycheck and matter the most, yet they are striped out so rates can be targeted in an easier manner.

Yes, the Yuan and US Dollar are shitcoins. But if you think one is not manipulated and the other is, I disagree. They both are and take different paths of doing so as one pretends not to and the other one openly does it.

The US realized the advantage of being the world’s reserve currency in the 30s and used the tactic as a means to defeat Germany in World War II by cutting off their access to dollars as their currency ran into inflation issues. Once the US established itself, after the war, as no longer the labor of the world and now the reserve currency of the world; all countries funneled financing through the US, effectively giving it complete control of global finances. Fine and dandy as long as powers aren’t abused... which they have been for the last few decades and now we are seeing the issues.

From that point forward if the US allowed the dollar to rally all other countries suffer because their debt is denominated in Dollars, so there interest cost rise. Without a reserve currency you have no way to combat this. Which is what China and others didn’t realize but came to hate.

China, has spent effectively since the 80s until now learning the ways of all US systems and policies and put in place the peg to combat this inability to control your own financial destiny without having a reserve currency. They’ve lobbied the IMF for the Renminbi to be one or at least create an SDR basket to level the playing field. The IMF has not agreed. 

Now, for the first time in a few hundred years there is an alternative fungible store of value. This has happened numerous times throughout civilization(s) and during the rise and fall of empires.

So, now China can allow the peg to break and capital to flow out and into another means — NOT —the USD. Now, that capital outflow also doesn’t have to go to a country with debt denominated in USD either.

So it gives China and others the freedom to circumvent the US... “the system” and get their financial freedoms back.

The US doesn’t like this because they are losing the control they’ve maintained for decades over other countries and this is why they are screaming foul or manipulation... even though the US has been doing it for close to 100 years.";11;1;False;worthlessTbill;ew5os0o;US labels China as currency manipulator;cmu8u4;https://i.redd.it/f306a4hmeve31.png

Core inflation represents the long run trend in the price level. In measuring long run inflation, transitory price changes should be excluded. One way of accomplishing this is by excluding items frequently subject to volatile prices, like food and energy.

"Yeah, well currencies without inflation don't do too well for serving as an actual currency. So, you shouldn't count on Bitcoin or anything with a fixed supply cap to serve as a currency.

The recent selling point has been to treat it as a store of value, but that could be problematic in the future when Miner's have no incentive to mine. Once block rewards are all distributed and miners are living off of transaction fees, there won't be enough to go around because typically stores of value, like gold, don't see very many transactions. So there won't be very many transaction fees for the miners. They'll stop mining Bitcoin which will lower the network hashrate and leave the blockchain vulnerable to attacks.

"China does manage its currency but this 'currency manipulator' designation is purely a political play.

Two months ago, the Treasury declined to label China as a currency manipulator, but China remained on the list of monitored countries. Other countries on that list include Japan, South Korea, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Ireland, Singapore, Malaysia and Vietnam. So your statement 'not every country manipulates their currency the way China does' isn't exactly correct.

Has china really changed how it manages currency since then? Not much. It's just that the US wants to pressure china into signing a trade deal.
