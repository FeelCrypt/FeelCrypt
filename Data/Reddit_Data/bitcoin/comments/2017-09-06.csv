"Well, depends how you look at it. Bitcoin went through what was effectively extended civil war. You got to give some credit to Etherum that's run like benevolent dictatorship. XRP also done impressive job. And finally, biggest impact - we had recent surge of ICOs.

Wait ICO fad to pass and you'll see BTC marketshare rising back up. I mean - BCH forked like a month ago and it's #3 in Marketcap.

So - sure - there is some value in betting on #2 #3 and #4 (my personal favorite is Litecoin). But you'll always have Pareto principle of 80/20... and I'm am somewhat confident that BTC will always be the leader of top pack (50%+ of marketshare).";1;0;False;howtoaddict;dmn3fhu;I will buy 10$ of bitcoin everyday instead of my daily cigarettes !;6y1hx4;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6y1hx4/i_will_buy_10_of_bitcoin_everyday_instead_of_my/

"People here are claiming 1.49% fee, but [this](https://support.coinbase.com/customer/portal/articles/2109597) help page makes it sound like the effective fee may be closer to 2%, in that the price they quote you can be +/-0.5% the exchange rate. I'm guessing this is to protect themselves against volatility (there is some delay between when they quote you and when they can complete the exchange) and limited market depth (like when your purchase can't be completely filled by the top sell order).

">Simply it's network effect - all virtual currencies that are starting now are like startups that want to go from 0 users and overtake Facebook. It just doesn't work like that. It'll take another paradigm shift for something to overtake Bitcoin.

I thought this too, and it's why I have never gotten into altcoins. I always believed the theory that no altcoin could overtake Bitcoin's network effects (unless it was as far better than Bitcoin as Bitcoin is better than fiat, which no altcoin to date is). And yet, we still have a massive altcoin capitalization, greater than 50% of all cryptocurrency capitalization. So although I wish that you are correct, evidently network effects don't operate on cryptocurrencies in the way we were expecting.";1;2;False;whitslack;dmmr6v6;I will buy 10$ of bitcoin everyday instead of my daily cigarettes !;6y1hx4;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6y1hx4/i_will_buy_10_of_bitcoin_everyday_instead_of_my/
