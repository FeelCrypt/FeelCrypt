We are in a currency war because the **Keynesian idiots** have been preaching this bullshit. Central banks can only increase the supply of currency and change the rate of interest that it is lent... look around you!!! They are out of tools and know that weak currency will get wiped out soon.....VERY soon. 

The Bolivar in Venezuela, Argentine Peso, British Pound during a no deal Brexit, the Eurozone bailouts - threats Italy wants off the Euro now, PLUS the US/China ""trade war"" has the Yuan devaluing and Trump yelling at the Fed he wants his dollar devalued (he shouldnt tell the central bank what to do btw -- these are insane times) 

Quantitative easing doesnt matter when every fiat currency printed too much DEBT. Its everywhere and the monthly cost of that debt are getting so high in places that the globally economy needs to ""wash out the crap"" -- hence we are in a currency war.

"When I started my adventures in Bitcoin/crypto, I was HODLing about 2.5 coins. (This was during the bull rally when it was closing in on $14k/coin.) Just before it would’ve hit $14k a coin, it went under $10k per coin. One article said, “This is the last time you’ll be able to buy Bitcoin for $9,900/coin.” Nope! Later that week it dipped to the $9,100s.

Thirty days later, from starting with somewhere between $17k-$22k principal, I came out with a little over $27k principal amount!

Regrets?? Never!! Not after earning $5k in a month!! :D 

Well... actually I did have one regret: I used RobinHood before converting all my crypto to stock and moving it off of there. Their service really sucks and I had a feeling that the longer I kept my crypto in RobinHood, the more likely it was that all my money would just “disappear”.

Other than that life is AWESOME!!!

This will happen FOR SURE when merchants/sellers decide they want bitcoin for whatever reason. The easiest way of acquiring bitcoin is to offer to accept it for goods and services. I know many merchants accept it now but today it’s not REAL acceptance since the vast majority just sell the bitcoin for cash immediately. In the future they will choose to start to hold some bitcoin. Then their suppliers will also start to accept bitcoin for the same reasons and at that point you will have the beginnings of a true bitcoin economy developing—ie. where you as a merchant accept bitcoin and you also pay some of your suppliers with it.;1;1;False;bjman22;ewqwj0l;Reminder;cpb6co;https://i.redd.it/rrk1ulea80g31.jpg
