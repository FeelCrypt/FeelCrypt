"2 types of bull run.

Based on the data on the graph ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è right now it‚Äôs close to being overbought and the lower end of the band is $10k. It‚Äôs more likely that if the resistance level holds here, it could start a downtrend back down to a lower level to try again. Not saying it‚Äôll be $10k, but if support fails it could happen over a couple of days;-8;1;False;joemckie;etaj79s;BTC at 12k!;capu01;https://i.imgflip.com/3574g2.jpg

Yeah I agree, there isn‚Äôt really much evidence to suggest it will go down to $10k any time soon right now. Especially not a sharp decline like originally stated.

">I think the majority of people who are millionaires because of BTC are just lucky they forgot about their hardrive or USB stick with a BTC wallet and stumbled across it years later. Very few people really saw the potential Im sure.  
>  
>Thinking about it, if you were in 2012 and you had 1000 BTC you wouldnt think about holding it as an investment. It wasnt meant to be an investment in the first place ( P2P currency and later the drug currency ) so the logical thing to do back then was to spend it. Now there are a lot of people who regret not doing things differently, but you/me/anyone simply wouldnt know what would happen to BTC in the future so why would anyone regret anything?  
>  
>Think about it this way, what if you really thought it was an investment. Ok, you bought at $30 and it went to $350. Wow, thats over 10x ROI in a relatively short period of time. Such a thing is uncanny and unheard of in traditional markets so you would probably have sold because you already made a big return. But guess what happens years later....  
>  
>The choice we made to be in this space is a choice from a perspective that things will be better in the future. I think that is what most of us should focus on instead of the past.  
>  
>No matter what choices I would have made in life, all of them would have had difficulties, and there's no reason to dwell on what I could have done differently.

">I hope so.  It‚Äôs a fun time to dream. I used to have 100 btc back in late 2012.  But I had spent them all on about 25 hits of LSD, I was pretty sure.  But when BTC was on the 2017 run, I still dug out my old hard drive to fire up the wallet and check if I had been smart enough to just leave one or two measly BTC in there.  It was a wild thought for a couple hours while the wallet got verified. But nope, my ass was too ‚Äúsmart‚Äù to ever discharge an old pc without emptying all the crypto off it first, even if it was only worth $5.

"I think I'm really just trying to say that you shouldn't buy on an impulse. Do research. Find out if the current price is fluctuating a lot and then make sure not to jump in on the investment when there's too much going on with it. When it jumps up 20% overnight, that's not the time to jump in. Unless your plan is to buy and quickly try to sell at the high point (dangerous gamble) then the best time to invest is not when it's seeing crazy daily swings.

If you have faith that BTC will be worth way more some day, then it's better to buy when it's dropping. It's a discount buy then, not an irrational buy based on emotion or fomo.";1;0;False;konidias;et89d8i;What an initiation;c6rj8s;https://i.redd.it/ruo5cnn3o6731.jpg
