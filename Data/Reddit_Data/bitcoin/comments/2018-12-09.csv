"Wake me up when that actually happens.  It still looks to be working fine to me.

Blocks are being produced at an average rate of once every 10 minutes; transactions can be broadcast at will; mathematics still functions as it always did allowing my private keys to generate public keys (and thereby addresses) to receive on that I can then provably show are mine and further transact from... basically, everything is still working exactly as it's supposed to.

So, where's that catastrophic collapse you're talking about? (or do you mean the exchange rate between bitcoin and dollars?  Because that's got to be one of the least important parts of the whole thing.)";0;1;False;dalebewan;ebf6oet;I wonder if we upvote this, is there a chance trading bots get confused and start buying?;a44t1m;https://i.imgur.com/f6TnaFp.gif

"Build something. Make it worthwhile to increase adoption. Complaining about price going up or down does nothing. Build onto the technology. 

Make it so it’s so easy that people (even banked people) prefer to use it to commerce with each other with, over their credit cards. Like email. Andreas Antonopoulos gives a great example how complicated email was than his mom just recently sent an email with a simple slide of the finger. 

Once bitcoin gets there while staying decentralized and cheap, that’s when moon. 
Embrace these down times to build the technology up and not to just keeping asking when, when , when.  

Don’t speculate, build. Bitcoin needs all professions not just coders. It needs better user interface, better storage methods, better marketing, accountants etc... 

You can make a difference if you believe in the technology no matter how small you think your contribution is, it is better than complaining about the price. BUILD and bring the moon to yourself.

"It should be first and foremost a decentralised currency. As Santoshi said, a ""peer-to-peer electronic cash system"". 

You can't trust a currency that fluctuate as much as btc right now. 
That problem is that when it comes to transactions, in order to avoid fraud you need to centralize it, so a broker it's a must.

Santoshi's main idea for btc was to avoid such mediation by a third party, and what was the second thing to be created after bitcoin's birth? A fucking bitcoin intermediary!

The whole point of bitcoin according to ita creator idea was completely distorted when mt. Gox became the main intermediary (although there were rumors at the time that speculated that santoshi himself was one of the founders of mt. Gox)";2;0;False;ErraticPragmatic;ebe4k8t;Priorities;a3n8qb;https://i.redd.it/fg3727v3an221.jpg
"Btc isn't just a currency, and you can't look at it as just a currency because it's like looking at 3d object and only describing 2d properties.

Game theory, Cryptography, Computer networking and data transmission, Economic and monetary theory. It's something else entirely. ";0;1;False;swaggyrabbit;ebe23hr;Priorities;a3n8qb;https://i.redd.it/fg3727v3an221.jpg
