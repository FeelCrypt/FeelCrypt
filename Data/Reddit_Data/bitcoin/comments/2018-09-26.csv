Not as fast as the Venezuelan government can if you keep their money. Bitcoin is quite stable compared to the bolivar. Not sure how long you've been in Bitcoin, but most of the time I've been here the market has been very generous and gave much more than it took away. If the market gives you a ride from $200 to $20000 in a little over 2 years, then you really can't complain when it then drops back to $6000 or can you? And that's against the dollar, against the Venezuelan bolivar Bitcoin has never even seen a bear market.;83;5;False;Miz4r_;e6p0xvk;"""But they can't confiscate your bitcoin""";9j5qd2;https://i.redd.it/rdik6k2qxmo11.png
