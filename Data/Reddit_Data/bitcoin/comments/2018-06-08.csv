"It really shows how ignorant people are to bitcoin when they constantly compare a business to a decentralized cryptocurrency.

In a centralized business all it takes is one idiot sitting on the board to propose a stupid idea and have everyone agree on it. Then the competition swoops in and steals the spotlight. Bitcoin just exists, it doesn't need to hire the latest talent and filter resumes, fire people, market to a target audience, deal with being politically correct, manage its budget, operate efficiently with all their organizations.

I'd also call bitcoin's prices anything but stagnant. Rising and falling by thousands is hardly stagnant. It has a very much alive market and the price isn't stuck at any specific price. ";2;0;False;zephixleer;e0bp9ad;Oh no;8pdd8r;https://i.redd.it/7azmglqxsm211.png
