The problem in the housing crisis wasn't the people flipping houses.  They usually ended up being the victims.  It was the big banks and credit rating agencies that were reporting false values to keep the loan money flowing.  I can't blame a person for accepting a loan offer with great terms, even if that is a high risk person.  I blame the banks for offering those loans, losing on them, then taking bailouts.;1;0;False;Adamsd5;ev6wskb;Quick, upvote this to confuse everyone into thinking the price jumped back up.;chbx9d;https://i.redd.it/pcioshemnac31.gif

Did the bot PM you?

"Did the bot give you a Pm? If not, look at it's comment on this thread. Click on withdraw button, request the sats, and it'll PM you an invoice. Give your wallet that invoice, then it's yours!

You have blue wallet? Custodial means they own the lightning keys/channel and let you borrow it. They promise not to steal, but you have to trust them.

I hope that will be the last of it and then it will go up (Hopefully) Anyways I have been participating in several projects lately like this [one](https://busy.org/blockchain/@hatu/stp-x-thunder-token-mto-prizes-up-to-usd8-000-24-hours-left?utm_source=lx1) they are the only project that promotes  MTOs. These are an evolution of the highly popular initial exchange offerings (IEOs) conducted on popular exchanges like Binance. Micro Token Offerings allow individuals to purchase listed tokens (already trading on exchanges) of high-quality projects at a 50% discount. Which I think more platforms/project should do to have more crypto enthusiasts participate in.;1;0;False;charlesgwynne;ev5lv46;Let’s try this again.

"Well, can't blame him on this one since it's our responsibility for what we put on the internet. And facebook just keeps you asking these details and you just keep on giving them because it's simply ""needed"" for you to access the app or whatever it is. That's why I don't really trust apps like FB or any social media sites (only reddit!) I also make sure I invest my time and effort to projects/platforms which I think is beneficial in the long run like this one which was recently held an[MTO event](https://busy.org/blockchain/@hatu/stp-x-thunder-token-mto-prizes-up-to-usd8-000-24-hours-left?utm_source=lx1). Too bad I missed a couple of rounds but was able to win on the last part and I get to buy tokens half the price which is really cool. Anyways, I think we should just DYOR when investing to tokens like this libra thing and learn from it.";1;0;False;charlesgwynne;ev5jstp;But why would someone buy FacebookCoin, Mark??;c27kk9;https://www.blockcubed.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/mark-zuckerberg-uses-you.jpg
