"That image concerns the search for the solution of the puzzle with a practical sense and is the approach that I have adopted, I hope my thesis can be confirmed when the 12 or 24 words will be revived, but it can also be the solution will come from a Lara Croft approach that I see many are adopting.

With a spiral you can easily sort the words and read very interesting phrases, following the path formed by the numbers from 0 to 12 \(\-1\) present in the image, I mean, I suppose that the solution hides along the straight lines and curves of the golden rectangle , but I do not understand where to find the ""X"", but the absence of ""technical"" information makes the game not fun for me, that is, it is not enough to find words, we must also know if 12 or 24 if bip49 or bip141 and other things quite technical.

"I've been looking through Crypto Greeting's website for clues. Their gift cards have wallet qr codes so you can load up btc on them. In the instructions of how to get the btc out of the card they suggest Bread or Copay wallets which ask for a 12 word seed to restore. I think this could be a good reason to believe that this puzzle is a 12 word seed.

"Everything?

I know that sounds like a cheeky answer, but seriously, everything. Like I said, I don't like Hillary, primarily because I don't believe she is in politics for the right reasons, nor do I believe she is honest or genuine in her beliefs and policies. Her policies tend to reflect what is politically expedient and attractive, rather than any ideology or philosophy she believes in. 

But even Hillary's worst traits and tendencies, Trump has markedly worse. Petulant and proud of it. Boastful, vain and domineering. Ill tempered and vengeful, incapable of turning the other cheek or even simply focusing on what matters. He flip flops worse than Hillary, as evidenced by the health care repeal effort and more recently, the parkland school shooting where he advocated taking people's guns without warrants or justification.

Hillary is power hungry sure, but she does seems to have modicum of interest in the common man's well being. Trump is purely power hungry, simply using the rhetoric of populism to gain more power and support, his policies damning and ruining the very people he claims to support and whom elected him.

This could seriously go on for pages and pages, so I'm gonna cut it off there. Just know that I could easily keep going. ";1;0;False;Anomalyzero;e02tr0v;Is this a bull run?;8kzzay;https://imgur.com/EEkCke2
