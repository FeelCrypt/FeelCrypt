While the bitcoin crash is unfortunate for those involved in investing in it, it’s crash should have been easy to detect for one simple reason. Historically, investment crazes don’t go well.

Plus Coinbase used to respond to complaints in a customer friendly way. I actually hit up their support about a mistake I made asking if they could reverse some of the fees (because, IMO if you don't ask, you can't get it anyway). I didn't think they would do it, and this was in early 2016. But they did reverse about $10 in fees which was really nice (although, they were a little snippy about it). But now, they not only don't give a fuck about looking good, they just ignore shit entirely and I guess the squeaky wheel gets the grease. But if the squeaky wheel isn't the guy filing complaints with agencies over $40k USD missing for over a month then WTF is the squeaky wheel? Are they getting sued?

"i mean, not exactly, but kind of.

basically, the constitution of the US, 4th ammendment, protects us against unreasonable search and seizure and is supposed to keep us secure in our papers. After 9/11 the last vestige of restraint was torn away and an effort was put in place to basically whole sale violate the 4th ammendment with systems that are intended to anaylze all the things. it starts small, but iterative improvement and all that eventually you get to a place you never intended.

The DHS themselves don't have direct access to these tools, but the NSA can be looped in and the dhs can retcon evidence to fit the stuff found through what should be illegal means.

the other shit part of this is that the arguement can be made that the 4th ammendment is not being violated if machines (AI and data mining tools) are being used on massive amounts of data to identify and highlight activities, since there's the interpretation that people are secure in the papers from other humans....

we're going to be putting a lot of trust in machines in order to bypass the constitution and this is very dangerous slippery slope stuff.";2;0;False;togetherwem0m0;dsxk956;***** WARNING ****** DO NOT SEND ANY (LARGE) SUMS TO COINBASE. $40,000 wire transfer missing since 12/18 with ZERO response;7rfwec;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7rfwec/warning_do_not_send_any_large_sums_to_coinbase/

Yes, U.S. dollars in your Gemini account are eligible for FDIC insurance, subject to applicable limitations.

No, at this time the U.S. government does not insure any Digital Assets (e.g. Bitcoin or Ether) deposits, however, we are heavily capitalized to protect the Digital Assets that you store with us. In addition, we are insured by a top-tier insurance company to protect you from internal malfeasance.

Any noob friendly services similar to coinbase? I'm brand spanking new to mining and just getting my feet under me. Only making ~$5-6 a day with no aspirations for investment or heavy mining, just trying to make some beer money out of my boredom. Coinbase seems user friendly and I don't stand a lot to lose since I have little invested (already had fair strong gaming computer). Plus for low incoming mining like myself, the Nicehash minimum transfer of .002 to coinbase is appealing for easy and regular cashout.

After reading most of the top comments on here, this coinbase sounds like a Ponzi Scheme. They take 1 month to provide you with the money you deposited or withdrew because they need money coming in to pay the money going out. It takes a month or more to gather the new investors and their money so they can then process the requests from the last month. It sounds exactly like Bernie Madoff's love child. If my money was taken and hasn't been returned within 30 days, I would file a lawsuit to get the ball rolling.

"Stop using wire transfers FFS! 

Coinbase has instant buys when you verify properly... if you can't be bothered to setup instant buying then you will have to wait. Hell you could have had your money (either in coinbase or refunded) by now if you had just done a standard buy order on the website using your bank account. $40k is a suspiciously large amount of money to send according to the US government who see anything over 10k as a red flag.  Your money is being held up because of regulations, they won't talk to you because of regulations that say they can't while it's being investigated.

"Coinbase has a user friendly interface for new users to get started, gdax is also very user friendly in comparison to others and has no fee withdrawals... They are also the most popular and marketing is up there so its usually the first you find on search results. Thats why they have so many users and continue to gain more and more users.

As for the limits they start small but as volume increases so do your limits. I'm at 100k. They maybe even run credit checks and higher credit scores get higher limits.

OP's 40k will show up eventually. He may have been saved by that since on Dec. 18th he would've only been able to buy ~2btc with 40k and today he can get about ~3.5btc.

"That's shitty but they are too busy with tens or hundreds of thousands of other tickets right now..

The DMV and tax office don't care who you are or how much you are paying or what kind of car you drive. This is no different.   
 
 They very likely have insane numbers of easy to fix tickets or non issues like ""where is my bitcoin?"" that are taking a long time to get through because the number of noobs entering the market is staggering. The problem is your ticket has probably not even been reviewed by a human being yet. 

 Contrary to popular beleif a larger sum might take even longer to review and solve because it cannot typically be handled by the front line individuals doing initial reviews of claims.

"Coinbase, Bitfinex, Bittrex, and Tether (probably closely linked to Bitfinex) are in kahoots on suspending new account creation with an exoteric justification of ""servers are overwhelmed"".

They are creating artificial lack of demand.

Tether had an attack back in November that really was the weak link.  If one can buy Tether from fiat that can be then sent to other exchanges creating demand.  I call nonsense.

It's more difficult for the media to manipulate the markets  this way; most people are in a HOLD/SELL state while keeping out new money from the system.

I have numerous friends that want to buy into BTC (and other crypto) however can't due to the systems to do so for new users.

Yes, bitcoin needs to die for other tech to flourish but it's being done is a shady manner.

Note:

There also needs to be a class action lawsuit formed against Bittrex for stealing NEO GAS.  NEO GAS is effectively an intergral split of the NEO coin.  Exchanges like Binance and Kucoin appear to properly award NEO GAS to holders in their wallets.  Bittrex has been doing this since trading NEO.  If they can't support the coin and this feature of it they should not offer it on the exchange as it's theft.  This is where regulations need to be imposed.

My dad sent a pretty big amount of money to them, and there has been no response for about a week. He wrote a couple of times to the service, and got a letter in return with dozens of absolutely ridiculous questions. Some of them (prove the origin of the money) he literally can not answer because the money was earned 15 years ago back when he still worked, and no documents were saved. What happens to the money if he can not provide answers remains unknown.

I also did a little search in various languages, he isn't the only one who's been having trouble with Bitstemp since December. Which is weird, because he used Bitstemp four times in the past and had no problems.

I have tried Bitfinex, Biannce, Bittrex, and few others. I have had the best experiences with coinbase/GDAX.

So for a person going in with about 500 euros it makes no sense to go anywhere but coinbase/gdax.

"No, my credit union is enthusiastic about bitcoin. When I first started making large withdrawals, they asked me what was going on, got confused, called the corporate office for guidance on how to handle it, asked me more questions, figured it out, then invited me to join their wealth management program, where they have been very keen to keep up to date on the state of cryptocurrencies.

As for not calling cryptocurrencies currencies, your ignorance belies you, despite your supposed profession. Currency is simply a representation of wealth that mutual parties agree to exchange, and requires no clearing house to be legitimate, despite your assertion otherwise. (See: Solomon Island shell necklaces, Rai stones.) And even if it did, crypto smart contracts provide mechanisms to eliminate counterparty risks, which disproves the need for a centralized clearing house anyway. (Checkmate.)

"Or, Bitcoin transfers are super slow getting transactions verified. Bitcoin is widely known by experienced crypto traders to be a store of value and not a coin for transfer, although that was the original idea. I would suggest buying LTC or ETH as transaction times are far less. It can take days or even weeks to confirm a block transaction that size on the Bitcoin blockchain. LTC and ETH are on the Coinbase exchange and have an improved version of the blockchain thats just more efficient at approving transactions on the blockchain ledger. The money isn't lost, the laggy blockchain is just that--laggy. It could show up in a week or two if you just wait.

Just FYI: contacting authorities brings bad light to the crypto space. My advice is do your own research before you buy, especially that amount. Every Coinbase account has a limit for withdrawls/deposits depending on how secure your account is. Chances are OP doesn't have 2 factor auth activated on his account too. Coinbase obviously takes security seriously, as they want to be a legitimate place for new and novice crypto users, hence why they cooperate with IRS audits. In fact, OP has made his account less secure by overreacting to a security issue, by posting his case number.";-4;1;False;goober_boobz;dswyj7x;***** WARNING ****** DO NOT SEND ANY (LARGE) SUMS TO COINBASE. $40,000 wire transfer missing since 12/18 with ZERO response;7rfwec;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7rfwec/warning_do_not_send_any_large_sums_to_coinbase/

Profitability is not a trait of a currency. Where have I said it is? Quote me on that. Please read what I say carefully, it seems like you're replying just to pretend you have a related point to make.

"lol My experience is building a few websites, and the petitions site seems like something I might be able to make. I like mentioning the Trump eating Big Macs thing because it cracks me up... remove that sentence and I am being honest. 

You saying ""ohhh so your not a professional web developer currently and are on top of all the latest stuff about building webpages..... FUDDDDD""

What my mediocre level of web developing ability is telling me is that taking down a site for a month to upgrade it makes no sense. When you have a site and you are going to upgrade it you build the upgrade on a ""test net"" and then you release it after it's done [just like crypto currencies do](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/blockstream-releases-lightning-charge-launches-test-e-commerce-store/).

"What exactly are they improving about the site? and Why take it down for over a month to do it?

Most of the time when you upgrade a web site you keep the main site up then you create what is basically a copy of the site and you build the new site based on the copy and test it then you just release the new site. 

Taking down a web site for a month to improve it makes very little sense unless the underlying database (or some other more complex component) is screwed and you have to rebuild it....that said a database full of petitions isn't really a terribly hard thing to rebuild and shouldn't take a month (more like a weekend).

I cannot conceive of a single thing that site would need to be taken down for a month to improve upon or fix. Someone with more development experience than myself might be able to change my mind but I think the answer is they took it down so Trump didn't have to be worried by it while he eats Big Macs in bed.
