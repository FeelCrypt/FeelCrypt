"For me it's a security thing.

After using bitcoin I refuse to buy things with my credit card. It's ridiculous that I need to hand out my sensitive credit card information to be saved forever on a server somewhere.

Early on mining bitcoins was very easy, running a computer program for a day or two would get you dozens. As time goes on the amount you can get from mining decreases. So later people had to buy from the earlier people for higher prices. Then the people that bought it from the first people sold it for even higher prices. In general bitcoin is based on the idea this is going to work like that forever and you will always be able to buy it and then sell it to someone else for more, and then the person they sold it to can sell it to the next person for even more forever and ever which is a pretty dumb idea, but whateves! ;-1;1;False;MuForceShoelace;cex08jc;TigerDirect.com now accepting Bitcoin!!;1vyazz;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1vyazz/tigerdirectcom_now_accepting_bitcoin/

"Debit/creditcard is not hard cash, its virtual digits, its soft money as it can be charged back, that is withdrawn up to 6 months after a purchase, something that creates problems for many online retailers. Since its abused.

A Bitcoin transaction can never be withdrawn once give away, thus its more like real cash. This is one of the unique properties of bitcoins. 

This also makes buying bitcoin with creditcards somewhat not compatible.

The fact that once they are sent they are gone also means that you have to be more careful about viruses and keyloggers, a problem which will be solved in the future with hardware wallets.

Bitcoin is money and it makes it easy to know how much money you have compared to how much there will ever be. Try to know how much fiat currency you will have compared to how much there will be...

The price of bitcoin and the value of the Bitcoin network increase as more people use them, there are more places to spend them on, and more people want them. Its also up to its users what the value of bitcoins are, if people are willing to sell them cheap, than thats their value, if most people really think they are worth more than they are.";1;0;False;ubetu;cewzlmi;TigerDirect.com now accepting Bitcoin!!;1vyazz;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1vyazz/tigerdirectcom_now_accepting_bitcoin/
"Since the downvotes show that the typical Reddit user hasn't yet graduated from teenagerhood, here's the wikipedia on it:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TigerDirect#Controversies

TL;DR:

TigerDirect is under a 20 year order to provide warranty details because the FTC believes they scammed people.  They sued Apple because they believe customers don't understand the difference between TigerDirect the store, and OSX 10.4, the operating system.  The Florida Attorney General has investigated them for mail in rebate fraud and an astoundingly poor BBB rating.  TigerDirect's former comptroller admitted TigerDirect purposely didn't pay rebates until customers moaned for them.  Dell sued TigerDirect for lying about Dell products.  3 years after the first mail in rebate fraud investigation, TigerDirect was sued by the Attorney General for using another mail in rebate scam to keep customers from getting their rebates.  The board of directors of this company was also accused by the SEC of being involved in the theft of hundreds of thousands of dollars of merchandise so he could lie to shareholders on company reports.  He was fined by the SEC and lost his stock options.

"It honestly applies to very few cards.  I was shocked when I saw it initially and by the time I made it to checkout the product had been pulled, only to be re-added moments later with a higher price and max order of 1.

If you see a card that is selling for much less than other cards of the same model then you can look up the speed [here](https://litecoin.info/Mining_hardware_comparison) and then put in that speed, the card's power consumption (Google it), and your power costs (check your bill for a price/kWh) [here](http://dustcoin.com/) to see what the revenue from that card will be.  Note that Dogecoin is really high right now and will probably come down as more people start mining it and the difficulty goes up.

With slower cards the graphics card becomes less of a percentage of the total power consumption of the computer, which means that efficiency is going to be worse.  Even a moderately slow card is likely to break even during is life if you have reasonably cheap electricity and can mine continuously, though, unlike 99% of all ASICs on the market.  When/if ASIC manufacturers come out with Scrypt ASICs I'm sure someone will launch a new coin that is targeted for GPU mining.

If you decide to invest any more into bitcoin you will want to get what is known as a cold storage wallet (this is a bit more technical to create but it will keep your coins safer and you can think of it as your savings account.  Would be happy to help with this when you are ready).

Indeed, I think Newegg will begin accepting Bitcoin Q1 2014, Q2 latest.  They have a bunch of mining equipment already listed on the site, and now that Tigerdirect is accepting it, it is basically a foregone conclusion.  The simple fact that miners can reinvest their BTC earnings into hardware without the extra steps of selling BTC and cashing out to fiat is enough to justify accepting BTC.;8;1;False;r2pleasent;cex3fre;TigerDirect.com now accepting Bitcoin!!;1vyazz;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1vyazz/tigerdirectcom_now_accepting_bitcoin/

*Here's a bit from linked Wikipedia article about* [***Two Generals' Problem***](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%20Generals'%20Problem) : 

---

>In computing, the **Two Generals' Problem** is a thought experiment meant to illustrate the pitfalls and design challenges of attempting to coordinate an action by communicating over an unreliable link. It is related to the more general Byzantine Generals' Problem (though published long before that later generalization) and appears often in introductory classes about computer networking (particularly with regard to the Transmission Control Protocol), though it can also apply to other types of communication. A key concept in epistemic logic, this problem highlights the importance of common knowledge. Some authors also refer to this as the **Two Armies Problem** or the **Coordinated Attack Problem**.

"Okay now I really need some explanations for some of this...

I understand Bitcoin can be used for some cool things like paying freelance web developers for instance, and even more controversial and innovative things like Silk Road and such.  I see that it is an interesting and useful currency.

What I don't understand is why people care about regular retail outlets using Bitcoins.  What is the point of using Bitcoins to buy off TigerDirect when you can just use existing currencies?  Is there a benefit that I am not aware of?

"I doubt that is really an issue.  If your client is in BTC then you probably are thinking in BTC, and would you really buy something that you think is 1000 times more expensive than it really is?  On top of that, most users don't have *that* much in their wallet--big holders are probably keeping most of their holdings in an offline wallet.

Even if someone happened to be that 1 in a million case of spending 1000 times too much, they should just have to open a support ticket and get the difference refunded.

Middlecoin is horribly unprofitable relative to mining on your own. Not because of the 3% fee, but because so many people use it which crashes any coin they mine, which consequently causes the pool to become unprofitable with whatever they mine due to the coins not supporting the volume that the pool requires. The only time it's ever been profitable was when it mined Litecoin or Dogecoin since they have huge demand, which even then you'd be best off mining/trading yourself.;1;1;False;skilliard4;cex5pei;TigerDirect.com now accepting Bitcoin!!;1vyazz;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1vyazz/tigerdirectcom_now_accepting_bitcoin/

Anna : Sure. 

Me: Under hardware, you display AMD radeon cards, and Butterfly Labs products 

Me: But I can't find BFL in your products 

Anna : What BFL are you referring to? 

Me: Any product by Butterfly Labs. 

Anna : Let me check. 

Anna : We do not have Butterfly labs products.

Anna : Yes I did. I am now verifying if we have Butterfly labs product.

Anna : For now, we only sell AMD using Bitcoin payment method. 

Me: Are they responsible for the broken link on this page? 

Anna : For Butterflylabs item, you need to buy it direclty from Bitcoin.

"While I do like TD for all the fantastic tech deals they offer, and I really like that they are being proactive/progressive in adopting BTC, I feel like they have to address some other issues at the same time. Particularly, their customer service department is notoriously worse than their competitors(Newegg and Amazon). I think with the introduction of this new tech they really need to hammer our their support training/guidelines for their customer service reps. I know firsthand how difficult it is to deal with their CSRs, particularly on their online support. And with this influx of people using the new payment will come an influx of support tickets. 


However, this is fantastic that they've decided to adopt BTC so quickly, and I'm hopeful that they can iron out the rest of their issues.";1;1;False;Gliba;cex2qz3;TigerDirect.com now accepting Bitcoin!!;1vyazz;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1vyazz/tigerdirectcom_now_accepting_bitcoin/
"I'm curious as to how returns work with BTC.

Say I pay 0.5 BTC for a video card or something today. I get it 3-4 days later, and it turns out to be faulty. I decide I want a refund.. do I get BTC or USD back? If BTC, what if the price of BTC has had one of those big swings during that time? Do I get the same 0.5 back, or do I get the equivalent conversion back?

Perhaps someone can answer a basic question for me. Pardon my naivety, but the value of a bitcoin seems to fluctuate more than that of the US dollar, correct? If that is the case, then how do online stores such as TigerDirect account for that? Do they have some sort of realtime link to the current market value for bitcoins, or do they just set a static price and keep it there?;1;2;False;Subpxl;cex071k;TigerDirect.com now accepting Bitcoin!!;1vyazz;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1vyazz/tigerdirectcom_now_accepting_bitcoin/

"Very cool.  I hadn't used TigerDirect in years, but will definitely check it out.

However, the bit about mining shouldn't really be there.  Bitcoin mining is no longer possible using GPUs.  All of the current mining done on GPUs is alt-coin mining, and mining requires a bit of tuning and knowledge that the average person may not be able to do.  It'd be like telling people they can get money by starting a company....sure, it's possible, but most people will just lose more when they try.";1;0;False;wretcheddawn;cex4w9g;TigerDirect.com now accepting Bitcoin!!;1vyazz;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1vyazz/tigerdirectcom_now_accepting_bitcoin/
