"> Could you elaborate on how this causes long run stagnation?

Capitalism allows for creative destruction. That is, when companies fail, capital is transferred out of the hands of those bad managers of that capital and into the hands of good managers of capital, defined as people who aren't bankrupt at that point and have money to spend to buy up the companies of the people who are now bankrupt.

This allows the economy to progress.

If instead the government is bailing out firms, it is preserving the management of bad managers over significant amounts of capital.

Similarly, if gigantic amounts of money are coming out of the government to fuel all sorts of sectors, that becomes a heroin-drip and then a flood, that re-orders the economy towards that flow of money.

We have now entered an economy that is essentially immune to injections of new money by the government. Look at the trends since 2008, the economy has flat-lined, producing 7+ years of stagnant growth, despite massive capital injections.

Creative destruction was not allowed to occur.

> Japanese stagnation has much more to do with low consumption by an aging population

Mainstream economy thinks consumption is the heart of the economy and growth, it's not. That idea is designed to justify government inflation.

The heart of economic growth is building and growing productive capital. You don't do that by spending, but by saving and investing.";1;0;False;Anen-o-me;dkc7e3t;Guy just did this on live tv;6mut9d;https://i.redd.it/nsokakmrn69z.jpg
