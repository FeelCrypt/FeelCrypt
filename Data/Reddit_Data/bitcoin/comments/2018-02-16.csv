I've been a big Genesis fan ever since the release of their 1980 album, Duke. Before that, I really didn't understand any of their work. Too artsy, too intellectual. It was on Duke where Phil Collins' presence became more apparent. I think Invisible Touch was the group's undisputed masterpiece. It's an epic meditation on intangibility. At the same time, it deepens and enriches the meaning of the preceding three albums. Listen to the brilliant ensemble playing of Banks, Collins and Rutherford. You can practically hear every nuance of every instrument. In terms of lyrical craftsmanship, the sheer songwriting, this album hits a new peak of professionalism. Take the lyrics to Land of Confusion. In this song, Phil Collins addresses the problems of abusive political authority. In Too Deep is the most moving pop song of the 1980s, about monogamy and commitment. The song is extremely uplifting. Their lyrics are as positive and affirmative as anything I've heard in rock. Phil Collins' solo career seems to be more commercial and therefore more satisfying, in a narrower way. Especially songs like In the Air Tonight and Against All Odds. But I also think Phil Collins works best within the confines of the group, than as a solo artist, and I stress the word artist. This is Sussudio, a great, great song, a personal favorite. ;14;1;False;;dubm9bs;Can you feel the Pumpening?;7xsm8y;https://v.redd.it/puosmxc2cfg01

"Maybe the analogy of a debit card is easier in that way. As long as you know your debit card number, expiration date and security code, you can't really lose your debit card. It's just that for  Bitcoin that security code is a really long number so a hardware wallet is just a device designed specifically for that purpose. One of the drawbacks of a debt card is that once you give someone that code you have to worry about what they'll do with it so the other nifty thing a hardware wallet does is assign a new security code every time you use it so nobody can just remember yours and use it again. 

Ultimately, that code is also like the serial number on a dollar bill. Every one is unique so you can quickly make sure your bill is real by making sure nobody has that  same number.

Wallets just help you do that. (I assume you know this but that's how I'd start to explain bit to someone who doesn't) ";3;1;False;inchhigh314;ducsj3j;Ellen DeGeneres Just Introduced Bitcoin to Her 3 Million US Viewers;7xz6ww;http://bitcoinist.com/ellen-degeneres-introduced-bitcoin-viewers/

">hah... uh, no, it's blockchain... It's a protocol that allows miners to compete in a race to complete a predetermined hash rule. It's built on the idea that the community controls the ledger in a decentralized manner. No banks needed.

Blockchain is a continuously growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography. It allows for peer-to-peer transfer of data, and prevents previous data from being altered. This makes blockchains potentially suitable for the recording of events, medical records, and other records management activities, such as identity management,transaction processing, documenting provenance, food traceability or voting.

What you described in the beginning is BTC’s hash function. ";32;2;False;;ducsu69;Ellen DeGeneres Just Introduced Bitcoin to Her 3 Million US Viewers;7xz6ww;http://bitcoinist.com/ellen-degeneres-introduced-bitcoin-viewers/

in the short term I agree stocks are worth investing in. however, expect a wave of decentralized startups disrupting standard hierarchal systems of governance. Public companies today run under multiple layers of management and so far that's worked alright. but when decentralized flat-level corporations begin gaining traction, that's the end of the stock market. it doesn't seem like it now, but decentralized blockchains like bitcoin and ethereum and a few other decentralized applications are proving to be better and safer alternatives than centralized applications. in other words..... facebook, google, and even retail might have their days numbered. ;1;0;False;Ttatt1984;ducg64b;"Bitcoin exposes the massive economic illiteracy of financial journalism; arm yourselves with knowledge.";7iyej5;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7iyej5/bitcoin_exposes_the_massive_economic_illiteracy/

"> I think we should differentiate between r&d spending which can yield positive returns instead of other forms of spending that is done for the hell of it...

I don't. Spending money on overpriced tech gadgets provides demand for R&D into higher-priced tech gadgets. It might be an *inefficient* method of funding R&D, but buying an iPhone still does exactly that.

Also, ditto for R&D->Jobs. Buying an iPhone creates jobs, in a way that buying bitcoin does not.

>We do have a spending problem in America, where people are encouraged to spend rather than save.

No, because people ""saving"" money in USD is fundamentally not the same as saving bitcoin - people ""saving"" is done in the form of putting their money into banks which generate *interest* - which is to say, what they're actually doing is *loaning* it to banks, and the banks then spend the money they're lent on increasing profits (e.g. through loaning to a business that then spend it on improving efficiency), to generate actual wealth.

In comparison, in a bitcoin-driven economy, ""saving"" bitcoin is **zero-sum**. For your bitcoin to become more valuable, other people must lose *their* bitcoin.  Encouraging people to invest in zero-sum investments instead of investments that *actually create wealth* is completely absurd.

>We do have a spending problem in America, where people are encouraged to spend rather than save. Surely You must concede on that point. If people held back some spending that would otherwise go to wasteful products and services, and instead put their money in a vehicle protected from the value-eroding effects of inflation, maybe we wouldn’t have debt levels that we have now among people of all ages.

That's two separate problems. To reiterate, if you put your money in a savings account and it generates wealth, it *is* de-facto deflationary. The difference is that

>a vehicle protected from the value-eroding effects of inflation

is *stocks and investments*, rather than actual liquid cash. Deflationary assets is *a solved problem*, bitcoin doesn't do anything useful there.

>maybe we wouldn’t have debt levels that we have now among people of all ages. 

People need to put more money in their *savings account*, which is, as mentioned above, technically on the ""spending"" side. The fact that they don't shows that it's some combination of financial literacy and advertising and consumerism, all of which are important, but *completely* outside of the scope of bitcoin. 

Plenty of people don't have a six-month emergency fund, and plenty of people have debts that accrue more debt than their savings accounts accrue interest, and swapping savings accounts that increase in value with *bitcoin* that increases in value won't change that.

"Are you just arguing for argument's sake? What year is it? I haven't used an HDD on a laptop in nearly a decade now.

Chrome is just one example and it is an app that eats a lot of RAM. However not all RAM eating apps are detrimental to battery life, but as I said earlier ***there is a strong correlation*** between battery life usage and apps that eat ram.

Is it due to having to go to the pagefile on the SSD? I don't know, but I highly doubt it. Much of the performance gains of modern CPUs comes from their large cache sizes, and apps **using large amounts of RAM will not be as cache coherent** as an app using a small amount of RAM (since CPU cache is very small compared to the gigabytes of ram that these apps consume).";1;0;False;writeawill;ducdofv;I've spent the last 4 months jobless building a Desktop Cryptocurrency Tracker: Moonitor.

"Haha, as I said in our other discussion, I guess you don't care about battery life.

Apple has chosen to cap RAM at 16GB on their Macbook **Pro** because more would compromise battery life. 

The current state of RAM is that it doesn't really have sleep modes so doubling your RAM doubles your RAM's battery consumption whether you use it or not.

Yes many have complained about this and I'm not taking a stance here, other than to point out that Apple's choice is mainly about battery life, and probably has something to do with 0.1% (or whatever) of their customers actually needing more than 16GB.

As for the slower macbook models you mentioned: These models also fall into smaller size and performance categories (and have smaller batteries and are even more adversely affected in battery performance by large ram sizes).
