"> You tried to say he was in bitcoin for some greater good, that he wasn't a mooner.

Wait, are you trying to argue that AnCaps aren't in bitcoin for some greater good? Oh please do. This will be fun.

> Even tried to pull some OG shit and pretend like you were there on the forum back in the day.

Want me to PM you on Bitcointalk? Gimmie your username there.

That may be true, but owning a successful biz is 10% idea and 90% hard work.

It is very much of a natural progression. Dimon has gone from nocoiner to shitcoiner. It's unclear if he becomes a bitcoiner since he's a) old b) has a lot of interests that Bitcoin competes with but it's not impossible. It's not particularly gentlemen either. Bitcoin can basically take or leave Mr. Dimon. JPM Coin gives warm fuzzies to business types that Dimon wants to court so here he is. The business types will get it too, or not, but whatever.
