"Most of the peopoe who held Bitcoin from $100 all the way to $10,000 were the people who simply forgot that they were even holding Bitcoin to begin with. Some remembered many years later... but many also lost their keys in the process. Anyone who was actually paying attention to Bitcoin likely sold it looooong before the current prices. 

You may have missed out on a few thousand dollars, but millions is laughable, considering how risky the investment seemed at the time and how Impulsive humans tend to be. That's why I laugh at all these people who think they would still be holding 100 Million worth of BTC today if they hadn't spent it on ""such and such"" in 2013. Please... lol

"Yeah, that makes sense. The reason I've got cash in the bank is precisely because, while nothing's perfect, and I've certainly had a couple annoyances over the years, I trust banks a hell of a lot more than some random crypto exchange (I mean, hell, the one I got my money from folded up behind me basically...).

It's absolutely fascinating stuff to me. I've been interested in banking and business since I was a kid, which is exactly why crypto was interesting to me (long before I started actually getting into it at all myself).

I've always thought it would be fun to do that kind of work, but I went CS rather than finance after being irritated with how academically weak the latter seemed and how bs a lot of the Wall Street stuff seemed (ironic a bit there, but then, the very fact that crypto has ended up worse in so many ways is precisely what's so irritating to me about it).

So...trading walls for walls. ;-)

"Honestly, dude, if anyone calls you about the transactions, think of it as a good thing. We're more concerned about your account being taken over than we are about YOU laundering money. 

Simple example: Someone gets your account info and then sends a shitton of funds to a digital currency exchange (DCE) via an ACH transfer. Once that money goes to the person's wallet, it's probably gone. We don't get it back and that means you probably won't get it back. 

There are some other batshit examples involving someone getting personal info from a bunch of different people through a variety of means and it goes something like this: Someone opens a credit card using some else's identity and takes a cash advance. Then they take the cash, deposit it into thier bank account (probably opened it using someone else's info). After it's deposited, they'll transfer the funds to a DCE. Then they'll transfer funds from the DCE to a compromised checking account, and then repeat the process until it turns into such a shit show that it becomes nearly impossible to track, especially when there are multiple people and multiple financial institutions involved. It's hard for banks to coordinate and share information (privacy policies and all that) to conduct a proper/efficient investigation so we file Suspicious Activity Reports and let the FBI deal with that shit. (This was pretty much an ELI5 example).

Banks don't (generally) care if the average person uses their accounts to transfer funds to and from your crypto accounts, they just have to make sure that everything is cool so when the bank examiners come in and start swinging their balls around to find the smallest thing possible to shove in your dick just so they can justify their jobs, we can prove the we conducted the proper due diligence in order to assure that the transfers were legitimate. 

I mean fuck, crypto isn't inherently evil, I think crypto is awesome. I see large transactions and obvious investments going in and out of accounts all of the time and I wish I had the funds to do that. 

I could go through the process of the ""investigation"" from start to finish, but I'm sure this post has been long enough to read.

tl;dr: As a BSA & Fraud Analyst, I don't care if you use your account to utilize cryptocurrency but people can be dicks and fuck people over and it's my job to make sure no one gets fucked over. In order to do that, sometimes we have to ask some questions. I'm not accusing you of anything when I ask you questions, I just need to ask for compliance reasons and to make sure you're not getting fucked over.

"I work in the BSA department of a bank and I can tell you that filling out a CTR (cash deposits over $10,000) isn't a big deal at all. There is no paperwork, it's all electronic and filled in through the teller's computer. You seriously have to give like two pieces of additional information because we already have your other information (that you gave the bank when you opened your account). We need your occupation/job title and make sure your ID is up to date (i.e. has your address changed/is it expired). I mean you can't even buy a pack of cigarettes or a bottle of liquor with an outdated ID. Stop acting like it's a big pain in the ass. 

If you file a CTR, we don't send it to the IRS, we send it to FinCEN and there's a 99% chance that no one will ever see it unless your name is hit in an OFAC scan. If you structure your cash deposits because you feel like being a grump, we have to file a Suspicious Activity Report on you because it's illegal and the FBI does read those. So you're really just being a fucking idiot when you structure funds because you decided to skip a report that no one will likely read, and traded it for a report that the FBI is required to review.

We've never shut down an account because there have been bitcoin transactions. However, when there is ONLY cash going in and ONLY Coinbase/whatever crypto-trading debits, it looks pretty fucked up and we ask questions... sorry to bother you. If you refuse to give us a little more information about why in the fuck you're taking cash from an unknown source, depositing it into your account at our bank, then immediately transferring the funds, we don't want you to bank with us because you're either money laundering or you're just being a grumpy douche. I'm sure there's more to the story than ""they shut my account down because of a bitcoin transaction.""

AML laws are there as a preventative measure. It's meant to deter it and meant to make it more difficult for criminals to use the financial system to launder money (which makes it harder for the criminal[s]). 

Honestly, it just sounds like someone asked you a question about the source of your cash and you popped off because ""it's my money"" and now you think that AML is a conspiracy.

None of this is a serious inconvenience that should negatively impact your day, you're just being unreasonable. Just stop.

EDIT: Even if you're overseas, I don't think that their AML laws are going to be much worse than North American AML laws unless you're living in a high risk/high financial crime zone.

"There’s very little education on this.  Many people are scared of the IRS and have a right to be.  

As I said there are MANY examples of people trying to avoid the 10k cash limit.  **i would always deposit 11k in cash over 9k in cash anytime and have filled out CTR many times**

But many don’t know this.  A poor guy in Iowa for his account frozen for two years and they took half his money bc he did 9k deposits bc he didn’t want to fill out the paperwork. 

He owned a gas station and would build up to 9k in cash and go deposit it.   

NOW.... if you froze his account and then the next day after explanation opened it.  That maybe would’ve been ok. 

But if you’re in the industry you know MANY casss or innocent people like this guy and others that have had years of their life or their entire lives ruined bc of some miseducation.  

——

Banks should not be police.  They’re not trained but in 1971 with BSA we decided to totally revamp thousands of years of policy with no public debate.  

KYC is a nice slogan but many are hurt by this and it’s not the rich and owoerful with their teams of accountants.  It’s the average joe or gas station owner that did a dumb thing but did nothing illegal and certainly nothing immoral or unethical.  

Money should not be used a method of control but as method of exchange.  Our government used money laundering and abuses it huge.  

Focus on examples of innocents being abused.  Think of their life with a year or longer with no access to their money and when they call you or your bank they get ZERO ANSWERS and have to go to law enforcement and still get zero answer.

TLDR. This isn’t about filing out a form. This is about the entire system is corrupt and unfair especially for the lower class person.

"Tax evasion in my country is a crime.  

So once again money laundering in your example is not needed as a crime on the books.  Arrest the person for tax evasion.  Arrest the front guy for aiding and abetting tax evasion.

It’s a massive pain to open bank accounts now.  For the rich and powerful and connected they don’t care as they have teams or accountants or work around. 

For the average joe or small business this creates serious hurdles and some of them are just not worth it.  

On the other side the banks often shut down your account or won’t accept you if the amount isn’t enough to make it worth it for all the paperwork they have to fill out (and pay for someone to do)

"God you're incredibly short sighted. Ever thought how maybe the threat prosecution for AML serves as a deterrent? Imagine if a Russian mobster bought a condo at Trump Tower with funds he acquired from illicit activities. The condo could then be sold in a year and the proceeds of the sale would be clean. This Russian mobster could then do a number of things with this clean money: make ""legitimate"" deposits into a bank account without further suspicion, take out loans, commit mortgage fraud, make investments funding further ventures or illicit activities.

Simply put, AML stops further crime from being committed and prevents criminals from benefitting financially. Your previous posts are overlysimplified scenarios and don't take into account contexts of transnational crime, corruption etc. In my previous example, the Russian mobster may have paid off the prosecutor that was investigating the ""initial crime"" and he therefore doesn't get sanctioned on the illicit activity. Not every country has the same level of integrity in their justice system.

Let me give you another scenario: a corrupt public official in a developing country in South East Asia has been accepting bribes which he then launders through a side business, say a local high end restaurant. He then applies for citizenship in Cyprus which requires a property purchase of 2 millions euros. The agent in Cyprus only sees that the applicant made his money as a public official and a successful restaurant he owned. The applicant is then given Cyrprus citizenship (and EU citizenship by extension) and when local investigators start paying more attention he moves to Europe, sells his property in Cyprus and is never heard from again.

Do you see how AML is much more complicated than the complete oversimplification you initially discussed?

"Yeah, makes sense. People don't tend to trust banks these days (or ever?), so I can see it being hard to have to ask questions (because they can be on a hair trigger).

It's a ""tipbot""; these used to be relatively common in the early days of Bitcoin on Reddit. As transactions fees rose, there were fewer that stuck around. And then at least one had the person behind it run away with the coins. I just run this as it's the easiest way to give people a little bit.

The idea is basically that it keeps a balance of your coins, and you can deposit or withdraw on-chain, or ""tip"" to send coins to other people on Reddit. And you already figured out how to accept, which is a good sign. Let me know if you'd like any assistance with the rest of it.

Frankly, it makes me a bit nervous because if the coins were more valuable I'd have to worry about financial regulation operating this thing, but for now the coins are still cheap enough that I hope it's reasonable to be doing.
