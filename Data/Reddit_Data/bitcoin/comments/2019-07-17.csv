Lol no. I’m sure she said thank you when it was given to her. People aren’t giving away bitcoin to friends and family to be praised and worshipped. They want them to have a better/easier life.

"Nope, you're not paying attention.

Everything not being built on Bitcoin will be replaced by something that is built on Bitcoin.

Bitcoin will be the global monetary standard, and those technologies with fewer hoops to monentization (ie, those without currency exchange) will prosper, and those with friction will fail.

If you think Bitcoin will have every niche built on top of it I feel bad for you. It’s a snail and for good reason, it’s meant to be a store of value. It won’t change its tech for many of years. Mean while Ethereum’s ecosystem is developing constantly. Think whatever you want. You’re just saying you don’t like Ethereum or any other blockchain for that matter just because your bitcoin will trump all maximalist attitude with zero knowledge of what’s being built on top of Ethereum such as Defi, insurance, smart wallets.

"First, let me say I'm not advocating a return to the previous gold standard. We need more flexibility than the traditional gold standard allows, but some changes need to be made because the dollar has slipped and both of your statements are factually incorrect.

&#x200B;

Wages have not risen enough to keep pace with dollar devaluation. Minimum wage would be $23.68 if wages kept pace with devaluation. [https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/08/07/for-most-us-workers-real-wages-have-barely-budged-for-decades/](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/08/07/for-most-us-workers-real-wages-have-barely-budged-for-decades/)   A major risk factor for fiat is inflation and the dollar has not been able to keep pace with it since leaving the gold standard and it's become much worse than even 20 years ago. Housing, cars, food and healthcare  are all more expensive in terms of percentage of annual income. The cost living hasbeen rising much faster than wages: [https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/101314/what-does-current-cost-living-compare-20-years-ago.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/101314/what-does-current-cost-living-compare-20-years-ago.asp) ,  [http://www.mybudget360.com/cost-of-living-compare-1975-2015-inflation-price-changes-history/](http://www.mybudget360.com/cost-of-living-compare-1975-2015-inflation-price-changes-history/)

&#x200B;

The past decade has seen the lowest taxes in US History. From 1932 to 1986, the top US tax rate was between 50% and 93%. It wasn't until Reagan's last few years in office that we saw tax rates under 40%.  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income\_tax\_in\_the\_United\_States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_tax_in_the_United_States) Other than running larger debts, printing money is how the US has stayed afloat and it's coming back to bite us.

&#x200B;

Wages are just one piece of the pie. The dollar has also lost value globally and it's value when compared to other currencies is one of the more important valuation factors. A currency valuable only in its own country isn't worth much. This was the USSR's greatest weakness. The only reason the ruble had any international value was due to trade with sister communist countries, chiefly East Germany, but valuation was still so difficult that it was worthless outside of the Eastern bloc. On the other hand, Britain has seen a large benefit historically due to the strength of the pound and it's still one of the most foreign-owned currencies - other nations still invest in the pound. (The US has been lucky for other reasons that the dollar is still the de facto global currency.)";1;0;False;djsjjd;etz1uz0;FUD;cctla5;https://i.redd.it/hwk6mdvpk4a31.jpg

"A few months ago, the network of BeeToken was hacked and whoever entered their email for the crowd sale of their ICO got their email stolen. On Jan 31st, the same hacker(s) sent out a professional email on the same day as the ICO crowdsale, asking people to send their ETH to a certain wallet address. This wallet address accumulated over 561 ETH which estimated to about $541k. 

I was one of the people who sent their eth to this fake address. I sent $1000 worth of eth which was all the money I had in my savings account. I was very excited for the beeToken project  and happy to invest in this company. On the same day and after the fake wallet already accumulated half a million dollars, bee token posted a tweet about this phishing incident and never mentioned they were hacked. They basicly gathered information of the people who sent their ETH to the fake address. 

On March 8th, Over a month after their ICO crowdsale, They sent an email advising investors not to communicate with any other fake emails (neddless to say, this email was very useless) 

On April 1st, I received an email from the bee token team regarding this phishing scam asking those affected by the scam to be patient as they are working to find a resolution within 30 days that will fairly accommodates the community. I was very happy to see their email which got me hopeful to retrieve some of my savings. 

On May 5th, I receive another email from the beetoken team sympathizing with those affected and asking them to wait another 30 days to reach a resolution. I waited patiently for this resolution.. 

On June 3rd, I received the highly anticipated email with a resolution. I started to read the email until I got to the part where I was given a $75 beenest credit to use their platform. I was very disappointed and depressed. I had lost all my savings and knew there is nothing to do to retrieve it. The BeeToken team made me and many others hopeful for a fair resolution 

They could've easily prevented all this if they sent a mass email to their potential investors as soon as they were hacked. I'm assuming they didn't want to hurt their reputation or their crowd sale by posting about their weak security measures. However, I'm sure the community would've appreciated their honesty. 

The low security, poor communication and unfair resolution made me post this for the community to see and to know a few things about this incident from someone who lost all of his savings trying to invest it to this project. I hope you can all be careful when investing into this project because they might not deliver on their future promises.
