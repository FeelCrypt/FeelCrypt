"First of all, they aren't actually asking for 1 Million BTC. What they actually said was this:

> If our auction raises 1,000,000 (million) btc total, then we dump more Equation Group files, same quality, unencrypted, for free, to everyone.

So if they get 1 million BTC, then a lot of files will be released publicly, but the auction winner will still get a different set of files.
*****
The actual website for the auction is https://theshadowbrokers.tumblr.com/. For those who find that hard to read, the auction has no end date and requires that people send Bitcoin to an address along with an OP_RETURN output specifying some way to contact you. If you lose the auction, you also lose your money, so don't send unless you are willing to lose your money. All in all, seems pretty scammy.
*****
I really hope that whoever wins the auction posts the files publicly anyways.

"No, the free file contains actual exploit code. It didn't come from Snowden's leaks (which were mostly just slides and documents). According to some security firms forensics points to it likely coming from some NSA server that was hosting the exploits. https://www.riskbasedsecurity.com/2016/08/the-shadow-brokers-lifting-the-shadows-of-the-nsas-equation-group/

If I had to guess I would think that the whole auction is a ruse. The leakers have asked bidders to send transactions in a non-standard format that can't be done with a normal bitcoin wallet (they wanted bidders to store their contact details in an OP_RETURN). They also stated that the Bitcoin from losing bids won't be returned and will be kept too. Both of these things obviously deter bidders, nobody has yet to actually include an OP_RETURN in their bid. Also the auction file is actually smaller than the free file, and the free file seems to only contain exploits and implants designed to target firewalls and routers. I suspect the hackers only got exploits related the firewalls/routers and they leaked everything they had and the auction file is fake and empty. I doubt the leakers will even spend the BTC, I think the leakers sole purpose was to leak this info to do damage to the US and the auction is a distraction attempt.

"Nobody sane would ever bid in this auction...

They've set up an [all-pay auction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-pay_auction), which is an odd, but legitimate way to sell things.  An all-pay auction doesn't work if all bidders can't independently verify the identity of the top bidder though.

Imagine this:

* Person A has some secret files to sell.
* Person B bids $10
* Person C bids $50
* Person D bids $60

Person A can now give the item to person D and take their profit of $120 (remember it's ""all pay"").

Alternatively, they could pretend to be a buyer and bid $100, then walk away with a profit of $120, not have to give their secrets to anyone, and nobody would even be able to tell the auction wasn't legitimate.

For this to work, they are going to need to use a winner-pays only auction.";33;3;False;londons_explorer;d6ismfg;NSA hacked!
