">actual bankers are at work doing grown up things... ...they don’t care enough to protest us so....we’ll make up our own pretend protest!!” this is humiliating.

I think you might be missing the point. It's satire, it even says so in the title. It's using humour and absurdity to take the piss out of banks, and actually will probably educate some people too.

The idea of bankers actually trying to protest in this way is obviously ridiculous, that's the joke. But some people who aren't yet aware of certain things, could easily see this and think ""yeah, come to think of it bankers would probably hate Bitcoin... Maybe I should look into it?""

"**The World's Billionaires**

The World's Billionaires is an annual ranking by documented net worth of the world's wealthiest billionaires compiled and published in March annually by the American business magazine Forbes. The list was first published in March 1987. The total net worth of each individual on the list is estimated and is cited in United States dollars, based on their documented assets and accounting for debt. Royalty and dictators whose wealth comes from their positions are excluded from these lists.
