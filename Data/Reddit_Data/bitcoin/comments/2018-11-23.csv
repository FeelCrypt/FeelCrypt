"Bitcoin got cornered. One entity went and bought every single coin possible. That represented the run-up to 20k.

This means that they bought as many coins as possible in a price range from about 4k -20k.

The price appeared to stabilize over the last 6 months because the operators need to sell all that back to real people for real dollars. The goal here is to take the average of all purchases made, and obviously, sell at a point higher than said average. What appears to be value stabilizing is a careful manipulation to get the corner turned into cash. It is a scary illusion. Don't be fooled.

Price dumping now because the corner operators are done. Or, they might just do it again... My wild ass guess would be that the same entity has done this in previous run ups. Fate and fortune blew in their direction for this last one. Not sure if public sentiment will be able to return to allow an additional attempt. I would call the 4k floor arbitrary. Some legitimate buyers are likely stepping in at this point,but I'd give it some time until the charts show a convincing bottom.

Evidence: I like markets. And some professor let loose with evidence to the above a while back. Stock market used to work like that also until early last century, when we decided to regulate that sort of activity. A century or so ago this activity was widespread enough, and unregulated, that it was common knowledge among the public, and was just assumed to be ""how it works"". Amusing side note: Look at that! We forgot! And history repeats... (Can still pull it off operating outside the U.S. in a country with less regulation, markets are worldwide.)

Ironically: The whole HODL'er thing plays into their hands beautifully. Wouldn't surprise me a bit if at some time in the future evidence is found of a directed campaign to encourage the idea... The less coins available to be bought, the less the cornering entity has to buy to achieve the corner.

I have had an eye on bitcoin since its inception because I have never seen a currency being born. Pretty rare event historically. Kind of sad watching the mayhem. For this thing to be legitimized, people need to trade like maniacs, and one of bitcoin's primary praised attributes, scarcity (or a set amount of coins), lends it to being cornered, again, and again, and again...

You will notice above I did not mention a single news item or event. Forks, fistfights, hodl'ing, or the zillion other coins that have popped up. Those things made very little difference along the way, and are largely irrelevant. I am of the opinion that 99% of bitcoin news is propaganda and clickbait...";1;0;False;DismalTourist;ea9vioj;It was a nice ride;9zd9am;https://i.imgur.com/6QqBbp9.jpg

"You're entitled to your opinion, I think you're and idiot. I'll continue to refute you.  I'm sure you will put together some illogical ramblings and insults. I'm having fun.

&#x200B;

>I don't need to convince anyone of shit. Gold did not become the dominate money because someone convinced everyone to use it as money. Economic reality will force everyone to use Bitcoin by rewarded those that do and punishing those too ignorant or foolish to do so.

Bitcoin is not gold. Gold had value before it was used as a currency because it's tangible, useful and stable. No logical argument can be made that  bitcoin will be adopted like bitcoin. You're second statement is nothing but a conclusion with no valid premise.

>It only looks like incoherent ramblings to you because you're an idiot. If you weren't you would see it as a very simple and certain outcome--global bitcoin domination of the world economy.

Perhaps incoherent is the wrong word, I can comprehend your ramblings, but they are illogical and unjustified.

>Fuck using Bitcoin as a payment mechanism. I have no interest in a payment mechanism as current solutions to this problem are sufficient IMO. I want a new central bank, and Bitcoin gives that to me.

Bitcoin was fundamentally intended as a payment mechanism, it's the first line in satoshi's original white paper. ""A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution."" How does bitcoin give you a new central bank? Bitcoin could render central banks useless if it become the dominant method of payment. A central bank is an state institution, Bitcoin cannot be a new central bank. Perhaps you could make the case that bitcoin is as a mechanism of money transfer, but that's not what you chose to argue.

> think your suggested changes are garbage, so fuck them. If there is a worthwhile change, the community will adopt it--e.g. SegWit. Fuck your bad ideas, we don't need them; Bitcoin is doing just fine without them.

Being a good idea unfortunately no longer means it will be adopted. Miners who control the hashrate and have a lot of power will likely never accept a PoS algorithm. To achieve satoshi's vision bitcoin needs to make drastic changes to reach sufficient acceptance so that it will function as a method of payment. Bitcoin is not doing fine, it's highly volatile, transactions are slow and expensive, eCommerce transaction volume has dropped significantly, it's inefficient to verify blocks, mining has become highly centralized through asics and pools, alt coins are plentiful, governments are trying to crack down, and numerous individuals are working on addressing Bitcoins shortcomings by creating new bloackchains. This disputes one of the early theories that people be motivated by stake to develop and enhance bitcoin rather than launching their own blockchain. Thus bitcoin can easily be disrupted.

>Bitcoin is certain to succeed and precipitate ALL other currencies to fail. If you don't realize this it's not my problem. Stick with fiat, or whatever shitcoin you think has a chance against Bitcoin.

I wasn't aware that Bitcoin success was akin the laws of gravity. I'm being sarcastic, no one in sound mind would accept certainty of any outcome except relating to universal law. Economic outcomes have infinite variables, Bitcoin is not universal law. Additionally, you conclude all other currencies will fail. This is in contradiction with you first argument of gold becoming a dominant form of currency suggesting that bitcoin will be like gold, this should mean that there should also be a silver equivalent to Bitcoin.

&#x200B;

Feel free to respond, I'll gladly decimate your appeals to ignorance, and light you on fire like your straw man arguments. I'm sure you'll slide down the same slippery slope bitcoin climbed.

"> You absolutely do need to convince me and everyone, or a majority of people. That's the only way a speculative asset, what bitcoin has become, can gain value. You need to convincing people to buy it for more than you spent, or more than you think it's worth.

I don't need to convince anyone of shit.  Gold did not become the dominate money because someone convinced everyone to use it as money.  Economic reality will force everyone to use Bitcoin by rewarded those that do and punishing those too ignorant or foolish to do so.


> Incoherent ramblings and invalid arguments, spouting bullshit don't convince anyone, or anyone for long enough to make it sustainable.

It only looks like incoherent ramblings to you because you're an idiot.  If you weren't you would see it as a very simple and certain outcome--global bitcoin domination of the world economy.



> 
> Bitcoins value is that it introduced a new technology and new way of thinking about the security and principals of your money. A problem arises that most people haven't adhered or care about the original principals. Centralisation is rampant, including wallets, mining power, and exchanges. Exchanges have led to it's deterioration as pseudonymous. It's viewed as a way to get rich, not as a medium of exchange.

Fuck using Bitcoin as a payment mechanism.  I have no interest in a payment mechanism as current solutions to this problem are sufficient IMO.  I want a new central bank, and Bitcoin gives that to me.


> 
> Even the open source principal hasn't been adopted or contributed like originally hoped. Few people contribute to the source code, and not a lot has changed. For technology to succeed it needs to continue to innovate, and respond to the changing market. Changes to the core should have prevented the centralisation of mining efforts. Further core changes to the core should have enhanced the privacy. No where did satoshi say the fundamentals need to stay the same. In fact the opposite occurred, the ability to fork is part of bitcoin, and allows miners and holders to vote with their mining power and adoption.

I think your suggested changes are garbage, so fuck them.  If there is a worthwhile change, the community will adopt it--e.g. SegWit.  Fuck your bad ideas, we don't need them; Bitcoin is doing just fine without them.


> 
> I really hope a decentralised and opensource crypto currency becomes main stream. But I do not believe it will be bitcoin. There is a probability that Bitcoin will bubble again, enough that I still have a small percentage, it's FOMO. But there is a higher probability that it falls further with the chance of not recovering. And if it bubbles again, there's an absolute certainty that it will crash again.

"It's actually a lot deeper than that, unfortunately, and the hash war happening with BCH has serious implications. Most importantly, that Dr. Craig Wright, whom is the primary force behind BCH SV (Satoshi's Vision), claims to be Satoshi Nakamoto while also going on regular tirades on Twitter and attacks against the Crypto market as the whole.

Quotes from Dr. Wright;

""Sorry, I have no intention to fuck with the XRP community. Just to remove all of the sham security frauds (XRP is included).

As for the people trading XRP, I could not give a toss about you.""

""To all BTC miners...

If you switch to mine BCH, we may need to fund this with BTC, if we do, we sell for USD and, well... we think BTC market has no room... it tanks.

Think about it. We will sell A Lot!

Consider that.... And, have a nice day

(BTC to 1000 does not phase me)""

""Death or victory.

Bitcoin is freedom

ABC will never corrupt bitcoin""

There is real danger in this war, because if Dr Wright were to win the hash war and BCH SV emerge as the longer, accepted chain for BCH, he potentially has the power to kill the BCH ABC chain -- which might be the point of the first great, ""hash war."" He also claims that BCH and BTC can already scale, and I believe that is part of his reason for trying to interject at this point.

Furthermore, Dr. Wright is pushing against the fork at this time so that the chain can retain it's ability to eventually challenge BTC to be the true, ""Bitcoin."" This part is my $.02, but despite however unlikely that is to happen, that could essentially destroy the wealth of anybody who purchased Bitcoin after the first BCH fork as the second great hash war comes to and end and the original chain gets retired.

And yet, that isn't even the end of it. Dr. Wright also claims that he will directly attack the BCH network via concentrated guerrilla hash attacks to essentially make the BCH network highly unstable for up to a year, or more, should he lost the hash war. Link: https://twitter.com/JiangZhuoer/status/1062773863564668928

While all of that has serious implications for the future of this market, it doesn't guarantee that this is what has affected the price, and in fact, there's more than just speculation to the effect of this hash war on the market. In fact, expenses of the BCH hash war are the most likely culprit for this major effect on the price.

Right now we have loads of miners that have been pulled onto two different BCH chains, only one of which will likely remain, and most of these are miners from BTC. First of all, this implies a difficulty drop in the BTC network, causing remaining miners to earn more BTC per hash, and increasing selling pressure on the market as they sell to cover expenses for mining.

But more importantly, there is a massive amount of hash being wasted on two chains nobody wants, so the pools will convert this worthless BCH into BTC, causing even further selling pressure as the major players in BTC burn through their financial reserves to fund the hash war. The only hope of the market recovering this lost wealth is IF BCH ABC successfully defends the forked chain and is able to hold the BCH and recover the value down the line.

Bitmain has also pledged to support BCH ABC, and are rumored to have machines on standby, if they don't already have any online. Dr. Wright has claimed he has no intentions of letting up in this war and who knows with the support he gathered what his reserves look like.

This is all already on top of the low volume consolidation period BTC was going through, so large selling pressure would have a heavy effect and after breaking a major support level, many are finally through with the stress and there's blood in the streets just about everywhere you look.

Can't dig up this source again, but it was also predicted preemptively by those involved that the selling pressure of the hash war, should there be one, would cause BTC to break it's long-term support and drop under $5k.
