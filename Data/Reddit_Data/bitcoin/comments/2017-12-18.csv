It sets the bar for what it takes to make a difference in someone's life because: why do something elaborate with your charity rather than just give people the darn money!

"I suggest a donation to the Mida Creek Conservation Community Awareness Group (MCCA) in Kenya to allow them to install a de-centralized Solar PV electrical mini-grid.

MCCA is a group that consists of villagers that live in a UNESCO bird biosphere reserve in the coastal region of Kenya.  They pool their revenues from providing bird spotting walks to tourists, canoe rides to see flamingoes and other birds and moonlit dinners for tourists from a small restaurant.  From the pools of revenues 30% goes to a bursary for school expenses for the villagers' children.

Unfortunately as the villagers live in one of the poorest areas in the coastal region of Kenya they are unable to afford electrical connections to the grid.  

A de-centralized electrical mini-grid will allow modular, scalable and efficient usage of Solar PV energy to provide electrical energy for fridges to store vaccines/medicines/milk, freezers to store fish instead of having to dispose harvested fish at throwaway prices immediately, irrigation pumps to help increase yield of small farms in the area, a de-salination plant to provide clean water from the existing brackish water, and lighting that can help conserve the endangered mangrove trees in the area that are sometimes burnt to provide light.

There are currently 52 homesteads that can be assisted in the area.  Each homestead consists of around 5 to 7 homes with each home containing around 7 to 8 familiy members.  A typical homestead can be seen here: https://i.imgur.com/YXC1JfO.jpg

Using a new de-centralized swarm electrical energy product from a Swiss company called Power-Blox (www.power-blox.com) a mini-grid in the area can be setup within 3 to 4 months for the villagers networking all 52 homesteads together to create a networked electrical grid.

A donation to install a de-centralized Solar PV mini-grid will greatly improve the ability of the villagers to improve their earning ability and uplift their lives.";0;0;False;mombasa123;drfpno7;I'm donating 5057 BTC to charitable causes!

Regardless, look at the problem we're talking about - percent of increase in profits.

Profits can be negative (loss), which means the number set is ~~integers~~ all rational numbers (since there can be decimals) , not natural numbers.

>Now I am told that I must take the number of grapes left and cut each monkey into as many pieces as there are grapes left. I am given a giant scimitar that can cleanly divide a monkey with a slice. There are no grapes left. The monkeys will be spared. I cannot cut the monkeys into 0 pieces. Or alternatively If I were to take each monkey and apply 0 slashes then each monkey would remain whole. So, there are 4 monkeys remaining.

That's because you didn't actually perform the calculation, and you don't seem to understand how division works or what ""remainder"" means. 

If there had been 2 grapes left, and you cut each monkey into 2 pieces, then the total number of monkeys would still be 4. They'd just each be in 2 pieces. 

Does that mean that 4 / 2 = 4? 

Of course not. 

(Edit: to clarify, the answer to the calculation is asking what the size of each monkey part is after dividing them: ½ of a monkey. Conversely, you can't answer the question ""what's the size of the individual monkey parts after dividing by zero"" because that calculation can't be done - you haven't performed the division.)

Is English not your first language? Most of your misinterpretation seems to come from not understanding that common language and math terns are not the same.

"There's a lot of value to be had in a secure, decentralized currency/store of value. To put this in perspective Gold has a marketcap of about 8T or so. Bitcoin is secure, much easier to transport and also much easier to access. If you're living in a country with an incompetent government, Bitcoin has a lot of use. You don't need to wear a tin-foil hat and be severely anti-government to see the value in that.  

Despite the large focus on price and the people, especially in the last month or so just looking for a quick buck, there are  developments occurring. Adoption of Segwit will increase the transactions in each block by approx 70% to start with. Also, Lightning Network, which relies on Segwit gives users the potential to make smaller transactions with little/no fees. 

I can understand why you would look at Bitcoin now and think it's some sort of overblown bubble.

"**Formal calculation**

In mathematical logic, a formal calculation is a calculation which is systematic, but without a rigorous justification. This means that we are manipulating the symbols in an expression using a generic substitution, without proving that the necessary conditions hold. Essentially, we are interested in the form of an expression, and not necessarily its underlying meaning. This reasoning can either serve as positive evidence that some statement is true, when it is difficult or unnecessary to provide a proof, or as an inspiration for the creation of new (completely rigorous) definitions.

">Division is defined as repeated substraction...you can substract 0 how often?

Really? 

Go ahead and demonstrate how to divide 5 by 7 using subtraction alone.

Edit: Even in a perfect example where subtraction applies, your logic breaks down.

Take 6 ÷ 2 for example

6 - 2 = 4 (that's once)     
4 - 2 = 2 (that's twice)     
2 - 2 = 0 (that's three times)     

Therefore 6 ÷ 2 = 3

The only way to prove you're done is by reaching zero, and the answer is then verified by taking the answer and multiplying it by the divisor:

3 × 2 = 6

So take 6 ÷ 0 now:

6 - 0 = 0

Even if you keep doing that forever, you never actually reach zero, and you never actually get an answer.

Infinity is *not* the answer, however, because infinite possible iterations *in pursuit* of the answer is not the same thing as infinity *being* the answer.

If infinity were the answer then you could test it by multiplying it by the divisor and get the original number.

Does infinity × 0 = 6 ?

Of course not. Because it's not the answer. There is no answer; it's undefined. ";1;1;False;;drfsc2n;BTC Grandpa already doubled his profit.;7ke4u2;https://i.redd.it/oq0o0kq2xh401.jpg

"No, I have taken lots of math classes. 

The entire Math community sees this as dogmatic. You didn't read the whole part that this is a semantical argument.

""It's really a semantical thing based more on consensus than logic.""

Have you heard of Non-Euclidean Geometry? Well, This is unorthodox math. I know how regular math works. This is math working by different rules. They follow a logic. It is abnormal, it is nonstandard, but it is valid if you are consistent. The regular rules are just as valid if you remain consistent. An alien civilization for example might not culturally use PEMDAS. As long as there is consistency their calculations can be made. It's the difference between a Pirate Ghost and a Ghost Pirate.

Imagine I have King. This king asks me to do three math operations. 

The first operation regards a task with monkeys. There are five monkeys and he has ordered me kill one and count the number of monkeys left.  I stab a monkey and now there are 4.

The next task. I am supposed to count the number of grapes left. The priests ate all of the grapes. There are no grapes left.

Now I am told that I must take the number of grapes left and cut each monkey into as many pieces as there are grapes left. I am given a giant scimitar that can cleanly divide a monkey with a slice. There are no grapes left. The monkeys will be spared. I cannot cut the monkeys into 0 pieces. Or alternatively If I were to take each monkey and apply 0 slashes then each monkey would remain whole. So, there are 4 monkeys remaining.

The monkeys are still deep fried whole, and served to guests. Though the guests don't get any grapes to eat with their deep fried monkeys. If there had been 1000 grapes then the monkeys would have been cut into pieces of 0.004 size and served on a skewer containing one grape and one monkey piece.

So instead of a calculator returning Undefined, or the software crashing the Calculator returns the original number instead, and software doesn't crash or return an error.

I'm a programmer. You don't know how many times I've had programs return 0 and then use that 0 in another equation and the program crash. Often times because of this I have to write in code so it doesn't return a 0. That means because of this the programmers have to write fixes to go around this. 
Though a fix is as simple If (g == 0) {g = 1}; 
There are other fixes like If (g == null) {return}; (This is  probably a better practice for reasons)
The results are the same. Either the original value is returned, or nothing is done and the variable remains at the original value.
By applying this non standard logic, the program does not crash.
By going with the standard logic and applying a fix, the program does not crash.

I'm not saying anyone in the world should follow this method. There is already a standardized way of doing things. There are good reasons why the standard version is in place(certain tasks would be weird, and more annoying otherwise). Operating in the standard way is more a matter of practicality. You really wouldn't want to follow through with the other way. Maintaining consistency would be weird in ways I don't want to get into. It is only useful in this one case. Practicality is the same reason why as soon as people could they dropped Roman style math.

My only advice is don't put in more than you can afford to lose. There's only one thing for sure and that's volatility. It can't keep on going up forever. The last month has been nice in terms of steady increases but it will have a correction (maybe that correction will be from 50k-30k or 20k-10k). If you can't handle losing a lot of money, don't invest too much.  ;1;1;False;mattchstiks2;drern9j;BTC Grandpa already doubled his profit.;7ke4u2;https://i.redd.it/oq0o0kq2xh401.jpg
"That obviously depends how the price changes.

If you bought when 1 BTC was $100 and watched it go to $20000, say, that's 200x more.

So, if you'd invested, say $5000, you'd have grossed a million.

For that to happen again, i.e for a $5000 investment (assuming the price is $20k) to make you a dollar millionaire, bitcoin would have to be worth $4million each.

I would suggest that's unlikely to happen. So yeah, in that sense you'd have to invest more now. But, if you ""only"" doubled your money, over these timescales that would be an incredible investment.

Bear in mind though you could lose it all.";3;0;False;;dreofam;BTC Grandpa already doubled his profit.;7ke4u2;https://i.redd.it/oq0o0kq2xh401.jpg

I will short Bitcoin, but now is not the time. In the words of a wise person you have likely never heard of, the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.

But you are bragging about your socioeconomic status. You did it in your last response and now you did it again twice in this one. That's a million times lower than calling someone retarded as a perforative.

"**Technical analysis**

In finance, technical analysis is an analysis methodology for forecasting the direction of prices through the study of past market data, primarily price and volume. Behavioral economics and quantitative analysis use many of the same tools of technical analysis, which, being an aspect of active management, stands in contradiction to much of modern portfolio theory. The efficacy of both technical and fundamental analysis is disputed by the efficient-market hypothesis which states that stock market prices are essentially unpredictable.

***

**Fundamental analysis**

Fundamental analysis, in accounting and finance, is the analysis of a business's financial statements (usually to analyze the business's assets, liabilities, and earnings); health; and its competitors and markets. When applied to futures and forex, it focuses on the overall state of the economy, and considers factors including interest rates, production, earnings, employment, GDP, housing, manufacturing and management. When analyzing a stock, futures contract, or currency using fundamental analysis, there are two basic approaches that can be used: bottom up analysis and top down analysis. These terms are used to distinguish such analysis from other types of investment analysis, such as quantitative and technical.

>remindme! 1 year, call this guy out on his bullshit when bitcoin is over $100k

Might take longer than a year, depending on how long the current credit cycle lasts. That is likely another 3-5 years and perhaps even up to 10. Bitcoin could of course crash under it's own weight long before that, but that's not nearly as predictable. The real carnage will come around the time of the next recession + financial crisis, when Bitcoin will inevitably spike to one last high (as people speculate on it as a safe haven) before crashing once and for all (once people realize that like gold *a la* 2011, it's utterly useless and impractical as either a safe haven or an actual currency).

A lot of people got rich off tulips, and a lot of people were left staring at a worthless pile of bulbs, the only diffrence between them being who happened to be holding the bag when shit hit the floor. Bitcoin has value, outside of just the value you have assigned it, I agree.

But we both know that a lot of the people buying into bitcoin don't know that, they don't care, they are in the gold rush, they look at bitcoin and see digital gold, and they will dump it as soon as someone figures out how to put some teethmarks in it because they never cared about it and they just wanted a couple dollars.

What you describe is a *consensus split* or a *schism*. As a *fork*, when it splits, it is a failed one (be it intentional or not).";5;1;False;sQtWLgK;drfvuwb;Vocabulary for the newbies by u/KMSouthgate;7kl1gq;https://i.redd.it/i1j5t0bjho401.jpg

"The average wage has nothing to do with it, its a store of value! AND Bitcoin fees are based on the size of transaction, I assume you just pulled this 20 dollar figure out of thin air.

Bitcoin is divisible up to 8 decimal places, so you can purchase very small amounts. If you put 100 USD into Bitcoin and it increases by 50% over the year, you gain 50 USD. Whereas in the meantime lets say the Venezuela Bolivar has decreased by 60% to the dollar over the year (you lose 60USD), it actually decreased by this amount in November 2016 alone, but for simplicity sake lets say over the whole year. In this scenario, by investing in Bitcoin you would have 110 USD more then if you would have kept the money in your native currency. Lets say fees are very high and your total gain is 100 dollars, that can still get you quite far in a country like Venezuela. 

Before you dismiss something with 'bollocks' I recommend you do the maths first.

"I don't think you're understanding my point because that's not how fractional reserve banking works

Let's use your example, but with fiat currency first. Person A deposits $1 in the bank. Person B wants to take a loan out for $1, so I take the $1 that I received from Person A and lend it to Person B. If person A wants to withdraw their $1, I wouldn't be able to fund it because I put their deposit to work elsewhere. Let's say person B takes that loan and deposits it in my bank. Now, I have $2 in deposits on my books despite there only ever being one physical dollar. The ""increase in value"" is completely on paper and doesn't require additional dollars being printed

It works exactly the same way with bitcoin. If Person A deposits 1 bitcoin with a bank by transferring it to them in the same way they would transfer to a merchant (i.e. completely acceptable to the blockchain), the bank will tell the depositor that they have 1 bitcoin in deposits. If they take that (totally legitimate) bitcoin and lend it out to Person B (again, totally legitimately) then everything is in accordance with the blockchain. If person A wants to withdraw that bitcoin, I am still just as unable to fund them with Bitcoin as I am with fiat currency

There's no need for alternate coins in this scenario and everything would be completely accepted by the blockchain--the mismatch comes because when you transfer your money (be it fiat currency or cryptocurrency) to a bank, you are receiving nothing in return. You're putting trust that the bank will be able to fund your withdrawal should you choose to make one

The bank would still be lending out physical bitcoins, but the IOU is towards the depositor, not the lendee. Does that clear things up?

One last point: I think what's hanging you up is the thought that once you unravel everything, you have more than 21M bitcoins. That's true, but it's also true with fiat currency--there is more money in the world on paper than there is physical money. Fractional reserve banking essentially increases the money supply (on paper) via credit, and hard money (like bitcoin) can't do anything to stop that. In fact, no one can really do anything to stop that short of requiring fully-collateralized lending and incredibly Draconian government practices. It's a consequence of the free market

"> I don't know why anyone would store their bitcoin with a bank though, a consequence of bitcoin is that a bank is not required

>But I suspect it would crumble away very quickly. With bitcoin it's easier to become your own bank than to trust someone else to hold it for you

Ah, see *this* argument I certainly understand and this is speculation/opinion-based on either end. I would have to disagree, though, for a couple reasons:

*Operationally, bitcoin could free an individual from commercial/retail banks (if we want). That's true. But there are also economic incentives for keeping your money in a bank. Interest is the most obvious, although interest rates would have to be higher as bitcoin is deflationary. Banks are also good vehicles for getting your money into other investments. What if banks required you to store deposits in order to receive loans? Is the alternative entirely peer-to-peer lending that is fully collateralized? Lending would very obviously be considerably less frequent and financing large purchases would be next-to-impossible

*What about people who aren't technically savvy? Right now, bitcoin has an advantage in that most of its owners are knowledgeable about tech, or at least willing to trust tech. But what about people who don't understand the technology? What about people who fear their hard drive will crash? Are we expecting everyone to back up their hard drives instead of letting a corporation handle it? I can certainly see a large number of people wanting someone else to handle the technical aspect for them

*What about before fiat currency? Back when we had ""hard"" money (the gold-backed dollar), where did people store their money? It was still in banks despite the fact that depositing in banks hardly possessed a clear operational advantage at all. I would be inclined to think that the same thing would happen again

Besides, I'm not so sure eliminating deposit-backed lending is a good idea anyway. If everyone had to post 100% collateral on every loan, lending would dry up

"First off, on what  planet are things like this so simple they can be fully explained is a few words or sentences.  That’s just a straight up fucking lazy way of viewing the world. 

Aside from that, everything you just said argues for the existence of mansplaining.  I actually never even made a value judgement about mansplaining, no less calling for a sudden and abrupt dismantling of existing social powers.  Nothing I’ve said even really argues against a possible evolutionary physiology explanation for the hierarchy of modern social powers.  My original comment only pointed out that mansplaining does exist.  And argued against the point that the roles can be reversed.  

Nothing I’m talking about even has to do with feminism.  So I don’t know how I’d possibly be alienating anyone from feminist ideology.  Positing the existence of a social phenomenon is not even ideological or a call to action.

Social construction, evolutionary psychology, a mix of the two, any way you want to frame the power dynamic of modern society, the concept of mansplaining is a real thing.  Value judgements about it are an entirely different thing.  

This is where people who rail against ‘academics’ get lost and confused.  They conflate the positing of something’s existence and value judgements about these things.  It’s entirely possibly to believe mansplaining is a real thing and then have an argument for why it’s not a bad thing or something we should not be chastising people for.  That actually would be an interesting argument.  Hell, that would actually be a productive argument.  Its impossible to have a real argument when the existence of the thing in question is being flat out denied.  But that’s a way easier thing to do than argue for why the existence of that thing is good or bad.  That shit is hard.  It’s messy. Fuck, you could argue that it’s completely relative and that values like good or bad are completely made up ideas we then made words for and that there is nothing intrinsically good or bad about anything.  This is where fun arguments happen.  But you can’t have fun arguments when people want to deny shit because they don’t like its possible implications once you start arguing about what value judgements should be made about it.";-1;0;False;lolmycat;drevqma;"JP Morgan CEO who said only criminals use bitcoins is accused by a Senator of illegal activities.

Don't expect cryptocurrencies to solve problems that generally are not created by currencies to begin with. Bitcoin is just the beginning and the bedrock of what the new financial landscape will look like. The power is in the hands of developers to build on top of this improved currency and I'm sure more than a few are imagining and even working right now on ways we could solve problems like wealth inequality. To suggest Bitcoin should solve wealth inequality as a feature would be like suggesting the internet should have solved all diplomatic issues around the world just by virtue of making it easier to communicate. It's not a magic bullet, but we're 2,000x better off trying to solve the world's most complex problems with it.;35;1;False;wellstruckFC;dre9rpp;"JP Morgan CEO who said only criminals use bitcoins is accused by a Senator of illegal activities.

"Oh then we agree on the same principles. I don't know why anyone would store their bitcoin with a bank though, a consequence of bitcoin is that a bank is not required. And any significant amount of wealth would definitely not be stored in a bank in fear of being frozen out of your own account by what ever regulation or government intervention. I guess it could happen if it was given a chance but there would be no bailing out of banks if crypto was stolen from them or they were unable to match the IOU's. And that risk alone should be persuasive enough not to store significant bitcoin on a bank or exchange (mtgox). Mtgox is a historical reminder of why people should not keep their wealth on a bank/exchange.

"Lol the liberal hive-mind.  This right here implies you believe everyone who’s value judgements fall under the umbrella of liberalism are individuals who have no critical thought that goes into the beliefs they have.  Talk about exposing one’s bias.

First, mansplaining does not define all male-female interactions where the man is dismissive of the woman. 

And role reversal is absolutely thought about and contemplated.  A man talking down to a woman is inherently differently than if roles were reversed because of the imbalance of societal power between men and women.  Men’s thoughts and answers, because they have long were the only sex which held positions of power and were educated at a university level, are often believed until disproven.  Women have the opposite problem once they step into these roles once only occupied by men, and they’re opinions and thoughts are not immediately valued equally to their male counterparts.  This isn’t some grand theory based on wild assumptions either.  Study after study finds that if you have a man and a women (both with the exact same qualifications in the field they are talking about and saying the exact same thing) their separate audiences are far more receiving of the man.  Massive Hurricanes with feminine names account for far more injured and killed because people dismiss the potential danger of the situation due to the feminine name of the hurricane.

Plus, your whole women do it too example doesn’t even prove your point.  Someone dismissing your thoughts by rolling their eyes is completely different from them stepping in and dismissing your thoughts by implying you just don’t have the capacity to fully understand what your talking about because you have different sex organs.  Both are shitty, only one is dismissive PURELY because of a persons gender and actively belittles them because of it.  More importantly, when have you ever seen women talking to men like they’re children who don’t really understand what they’re talking about in a professional space.  Can women be dismissive of men? Sure.  But they don’t dismiss them in the same way.  It is only because there is a societal mistrust/dismissal of women’s intelligence in general that the action of belittling their thoughts because of their gender is possible.

So maybe that’s the real divide.  These types of things are incredible layered, complex, and their answers are not simple or something your avg. joe from Ohio even has the time or patience to think about/ contemplate.  It’s much easier to not search for the actual ‘liberal’ arguments behind many of these things and talk about them in simple terms that strip them of all their critical nuances.

"First, I said 
>Talk about exposing one’s bias.

I didn't say you had a specific bias that made you anything specific.  So congrats on calling yourself a liberal?  Political ideologies are really just labels to neatly fit people under an umbrella that makes it easier to dismiss their arguments because of their closeness to other arguements/ ideas that may or may not be flawed.  This whole conversation is a perfect example of that.  
 
Clearly stating that people who talk about these things are hive-minded implies that you inherently dismiss their thoughts and arguments because they are not critically though out arguments by those espousing them.  If that isn't a display of clear bias towards certain individuals and their ideas, then I don't know what is.

>Reversing the roles in situations doesn't even occur to the liberal hive-mind

You completely glossed over the entire argument for why mansplaning is something that does exist, and how role reversal has been thought through, as the entire notion of mansplaning is based on that fact that role reverse is not possible because of the power dynamic involved.

Nothing I said diminishes the positive qualities of either sex.  There is nothing inherent to men that qualifies their thoughts and opinions as more valid than those of women.  Both men and women are more likely to believe something if a man says it and dismiss it when a women says it because of social constructions, not biological ones.  Here social construction is absolutely at play.  So when a man talks down to a woman as if she were a child it creates a power dynamic that works in favor of the man.

"Mansplaining is a sexist word. It's not the sexism that annoys most men though, it's the hypocrisy. For example, many women roll their eyes and make men out to be naive. If the word ""womanrolling"" arose from this it would be seen by the liberal hive-mind as arrogant and sexist.

Now imagine a prominent woman had a criticism of a man in power. Now imagine articles by male journalists referred to her criticism as womanrolling. 

The reason so many are disenchanted with the left is because they see the flipside of runaway liberal narratives. And its quite easy to imagine the outrage if the roles were reversed. The hypocrisy is what gets under peoples skin. I think this is what the whole divide boils down to honestly. Reversing the roles in situations doesn't even occur to the liberal hive-mind, whereas that's the first thing the other side thinks to do. So in conclusion, I don't think words like mansplaining help anybody, though I can see why it might be hard to see that from where you're standing.

"I am a merchant. I accept bitcoin as payment. 

You are a person who has taken a loan from the bank which has issued you with a ""bitcoin"" from fractional reserve banking they have created. You come to my shop to buy a sofa for 1 bitcoin. When it comes to transaction time your payment would be rejected as the only bitcoin the blockchain can accept are those created by the blockchain and non other than the blockchain through mining of those blocks, that is an unbreakable rule set in stone. The banks cannot create bitcoin as there will only ever be 21million bitcoin. Even when you put lightning into effect this is not possible.

Yes the only way I can see this loan working is if the bank holds 1 bitcoin and issues loans of another altcoin at a ratio of 1:10, but that would require merchants accepting this altcoin on the banks blockchain. And in that case the best case scenario is this altcoin would be worth 1/10th of a bitcoin.

Edit: the bitcoin the blockchain creates all have a transaction history that trails down to the very block they were created. And it will all (once all 21m btc are mined) tally to 21million, not even a fraction more or less. Nothing else is accepted on the blockchain.

Edit2: if the bank in this scenario give you something that isn't acceptable on the blockchain, it's not bitcoin.

Edit3: just re-read your initial comment. That's not fractional reserve banking, FRB is that the bank can fabricate money based on the money that is deposited in them and loan them out (unless I'm mistaken). And everyone is able to use the money collectively thus increasing the circulating supply.

"> I doubt you went to Harvard

I didn't go to Harvard, but it doesn't take going to Harvard to understand that some of her complaints are ill-founded.

[Here's a brief write-up, originally from Bloomberg, but this is the non-paywall version](https://www.reviewjournal.com/opinion/elizabeth-warren-is-selling-five-more-bad-ideas/).

On a more personal note, I have watched Warren interview Tim Sloan and John Stumpf of Wells Fargo, and it's pretty clear that she's just out there to make a populist name for herself. She [frequently takes things out of context to make her point](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/03/heres-the-heated-exchange-between-senator-elizabeth-warren-and-wells-fargo-ceo-tim-sloan.html). She's yelling at Tim Sloan for saying *on an investor* call that he wants Wells Fargo customers to have Wells Fargo credit cards. Imagine that - a company executive wants customers to use his company's product! The nerve. She then follows up with ""well, Wells had an overbearing sales culture, and the LA times interviewed you about it and they had documents that showed the culture"", while completely ignoring that Sloan literally says that they didn't present him with documents, they just called him and asked him about the culture. And then wonders why he didn't open an investigation immediately, but follows it with ""did you open an investigation when the article came out"", to which his answer was yes. So... exactly what you should expect someone to do - try to sell your product, then someone calls with an unsubstantiated claim that you're doing something wrong, you say ""I don't know anything about this"", and then when proof comes out that there is an issue, you immediately do something about it. And she wants him fired for that. She then tries to follow up by taking a quote about the vision of the company and apply it to a very specific subset of the company.

[All of her speeches and interviews read as monologues](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/282737#) - she's not actually interested in learning anything or doing any sort of investigation, she is solely looking to yell at someone who represents something that the common people hate. 

So, outside of the first few articles I posted which lay out how her policy demands actually counter her stated goals, I personally don't like Warren because she's the Trump of the Democratic party - just a loud mouthpiece for the very far left without any economic sense.

"Well it's really the media mis-communicating pretty valid ideas, namely that a ""hypermasculine"" or let's even say ""patriarchal"" environment attracts more sociopaths and bullies than other sectors do- would that make more sense?

 You're absolutely right, ""male-dominated"" is okay and not the problem; to complain about something being male-dominated is inherently misandrist. The actual problem is the toxic, asshole behavior within the finance sector which are actions wilfully engaged in by individuals who are usually male but always total assholes. Regardless of gender- the behavior is the problem here, not the gender. Warren indubitably is correct in calling the BEHAVIOR out but the article (typical MSM) twists her words a bit for the (clickbait) headline and makes it seem like she's being a misandrist SJW but her points are fair and asking consideration for women.

"""A Reddit reader asked about my energy consumption. There's not much physical exertion, so assuming a resting metabolic rate of 1500kcal/day, manual hashing works out to almost 10 megajoules/hash. A typical energy consumption for mining hardware is 1000 megahashes/joule. So I'm less energy efficient by a factor of 10^16, or 10 quadrillion. The next question is the energy cost. A cheap source of food energy is donuts at $0.23 for 200 kcalories. Electricity here is $0.15/kilowatt-hour, which is cheaper by a factor of 6.7 - closer than I expected. Thus my energy cost per hash is about 67 quadrillion times that of mining hardware. It's clear I'm not going to make my fortune off manual mining, and I haven't even included the cost of all the paper and pencils I'll need.""

Because this mathematical shit is what the bitcoin is. A bitcoin is not a piece of paper but a very special text which represents a result of a mathematical equation. As there is no way to find this special text so you have to use brute force (this is what mining is) and try every number. So to create a new bitcoin you have to find a result for this equation. So it is impossible to create one bitcoin by skipping the mathematical part.

"**Unearned income**

Unearned income is a term coined by Henry George to refer to income gained through ownership of land and other monopoly. Today the term often refers to income received by virtue of owning property (known as property income), inheritance, pensions and payments received from public welfare. The three major forms of unearned income based on property ownership are rent, received from the ownership of natural resources; interest, received by virtue of owning financial assets; and profit, received from the ownership of capital equipment. As such, unearned income is often categorized as ""passive income"".

"**The Glass Bead Game**

The Glass Bead Game (German: Das Glasperlenspiel) is the last full-length novel of the German author Hermann Hesse. It was begun in 1931 and published in Switzerland in 1943 after being rejected for publication in Germany due to Hesse's anti-Fascist views. A few years later, in 1946, Hesse went on to win the Nobel Prize in Literature. In honoring him in its Award Ceremony Speech, the Swedish Academy said that the novel ""occupies a special position"" in Hesse's work.

It really seems like there should be a way to narrow the nonce down to a smaller field.  The question is if there is a short cut, would it even be faster then brute forcing anyway?

"This morning I saw them touting bitcoin on Fox News.  It’s getting pretty popular.   

With that being the case, with its rise in popularity and value, couldn’t there be some sort of problem with it in the future?  For instance, inflation.  We are flooding economies with a secondary currency (actually multiple other (ether, lite etc)).  Would this not eventually weaken the dollar, As now we are putting money on top of money that isn’t tied to anything of tangible value and isn’t regulated?  

Maybe this is the wrong place for this discussion, but it occurred to me this morning after seeing the smug cunts on fox and friends mentioning BTC.  And please don’t take this as me shitting on crypto currency, I’m just curious, has anyone discussed this before?

Let's assume you find the right nonce on your FIRST hash! First, it's extremely unlucky considering there are trillions made before someone find it). It still takes you more than 24hr to compute it by hand and every time a new block is found you have the **start all over again**, so to win a block everyone else on earth needs to **not find a block in 24 hr**.
