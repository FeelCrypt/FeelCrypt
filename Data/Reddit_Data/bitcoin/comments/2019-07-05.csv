So I recently went to Europe where I have family and set up an account there. Then when I tried to buy crypto from that account the fucking Bank wouldn't let me due to AML process and source of funds requests and all kinds of shit. 

Now trying to buy in at 12k. Bank still won't let me. Now they're saying I needed a hardware authenticator to send SEPA payments, but they won't send it to the remote country where I live. FML. Maybe it'll fall for a while and this will work in my favour this time but thinking that I could have tripled my money is driving me absolutely spare.

"This actually is a rational thought process if you are trading for a while, since you have no idea where the bottom is and \`trying to catch a falling knife\` as many says is a dangerous thing to do. Say if you were looking at things this way a year ago, you could have said the same thing for $6,500 level purchase, yet it almost lost 50% of its' value by December.

On the other hand, if you have a ceiling and a comparison jumping on the bandwagon as the trend changes is not too bad. Once again if you looked at this a month ago ""shut up and take my money"" level would have been the $9,000 mark we passed and then fell back, yet anybody who bought then are in the clear. This is because they started buying in during an uptrend.
