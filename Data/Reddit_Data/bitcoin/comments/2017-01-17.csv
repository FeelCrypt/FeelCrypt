I hope the price continues to rise, mostly because that is what bitcoin does.  If it doesn't continue to rise it may indicate there are problems.  However I would never believe bitcoin failed just because it returned to a price of US$500 or even US$100. ;5;0;False;--_-_o_-_--;dck677q;"""R.I.P. Bitcoin.

"Washington Post is a rag always has been, Jeff Bezos has never been interested in anything ""fair"" and buying a newspaper is no longer an investment in a classical sense rather a social investment. Washington Post is meant to extend the personal clout of Bezo's.

i bought a 1 year zcash contract for around 2500$, at current level i will get 400$ back. genesis is a ponzi. they invest your money in advert to get the next people in. they cant even beat the average hobby miner with there contracts. I was 99 % sure it was a ponzi before i put some money in, but electricity prices are to high in my country to mine by myself, thought in worst case i can break even. dont invest in cloud mining even if you are tempted. if they could make a return they would not sell the contracts to you. i doubt the reviews on there website are real...;70;8;False;uglymelt;dck4c1l;"""R.I.P.
