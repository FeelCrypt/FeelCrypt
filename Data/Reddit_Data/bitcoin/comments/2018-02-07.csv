"Well, one there is no such thing as 'the technology'. Bitcoin has its own technology, the Bitcoin blockchain. Ethereum has it's own technology, the Ethereum blockchain. Monero has....and etc, etc.

Also, the problem with placing your trust in a company means you are ok with trusting whoever owns that company and whoever they have to listen to i.e. governments. Part of the lore of bitcoin is that no one owns it, not just because of its technology. If VISA used a blockchain to compete against Bitcoin it wouldn't matter.

I failed at saving multiple times. But having something similar to stocks that was so easy to use was awsome to me. The potential for growth and the principles of Bitcoin drew me in, and my desire to save for my future has kept me here. 19 years old and I do my best to put my excess income into Bitcoin instead of blowing it on fast food. Bitcoin is my means of saving my extra cash, and I hope others do the same. Once all the kinks are worked out, and all the price stabilized and all the coins are mined, I hope to see this as a true universal currency everyone accepts. Until then, I'll hold and hope for a price increase as others hop on board. It's a great community and the potential is there.

"I spent years with a traditional savings account that for whatever psychological reason I could only ever put a small portion of my paycheck into every 2 weeks. It had a great interest rate as far as savings accounts go but I never put the kind of money into that account as I did into Bitcoin. 

I think knowing the potential was there to grow that money outweighed the possibility of losing it. I still put money into my savings so I had a fallback. If I lost everything in Bitcoin then I’d still be alright. But after years of saving and working, finally reaching the point where I said “I just need a vacation”, having Bitcoin profits made a great break so much more possible. My boyfriend and I cashed out a small percentage in December and enjoyed the hell out of that time. Just that savings account was no way enough to get us that experience.

"The 2008 financial crisis inspired both bitcoin and a propensity towards saving money for people born in the U.S. during the 1980s and 1990s. Stagflation in the 1970s encouraged a ""spend money before it's worthless"" mentality for people born in the U.S. during the 1950s and 1960s.

"Cryptodad here. I have been in it for 5 years and although I have made my investment decisions clear to my kids, ultimately its up to them to choose their own path.

The most important thing is that they realize the potential as an investor and see real-life benefits to that.

My son hit college-age right at the time the 2007/2008 financial crisis had completely wiped me out. I told him: look, here is all I got left for you. 25 grand in a TD ameritrade account and its gifted to you. Your education will cost 3x to 4x that amount. Invest wisely.

And guess what. That sumbitch picked 3 winners that did over 30% for the entire run. He entered residence life to save on costs and ended up the director with the sweetest pad on campus. All paid for and even had some left over for his wise investing.

I am so proud of him and I hope that his knack for that will elevate his standing going forward. He did it on his own with no help from me (hell most of it was against my actual advice).

Love you Conor, you are the best.

""Save Bitcoin"", as we fuckin need somebody's permission to trade with Bitcoins. No we don't, that was the very purpose of Satoshi. What we *may* need is the permission to trade them for fiat currencies.

But if we need cryptos to trade for fiat currencies, then cryptos have absolutely no fuckin use rather than speculation.

My exit plan, sit on your hands and don't touch! This also another strippers rule for you. BTC won't go to 0, crypto will survive thick and thin, crypto will win. It's the future regardless of what people say. There will always be FUD because anything that is new and can bring drastic change will always have this. I am sure people laughed at the Ford model T thinking it wouldn't replace their horse. Crypto is a currency and the goal is to replace the current broken system. Will it? Eventually. Will it be BTC? No, but something else will replace it. Perhaps $DGB or something that is fast, cheap and easy also like me. ;1;1;False;HamburgerPoop;dtwg0hy;Hodlers right now;7vvei1;https://youtu.be/RbpRlYpGtSg

This is absolutely not true. The only people who have lost anything are those that bought within the last 4 months and sold lower than they bought in. I don't know of any holders who consider holding a 4 month activity that ceases when prices dip. Considering the significant number of users who bought at least 6 months ago and are still up hundreds to thousands of percent, I think it is clearly false that anyone who profited in any way has done better than those holding.

"Do you think that every hodler bought at 20k? It's really a tiny fraction, I don't think I've seen anyone admit to doing that. It's probably mostly unlucky traders who sold again at their stop-loss (19k or whatever).

Just because some mania driven bull market drove the price up to this point, doesn't mean that every bitcoin holder lost money. According to your logic, if the price jumps to a million and drops to 8k again, all holders will have lost all the *potential* profit making? That doesn't make any sense, nobody can live like that. Your property value fluctuates, you're fiat fluctuates, you're friggin food prices fluctuates, if you try to optimize every cent of value you have, you'll go nuts!

The moral of the story is, good traders profit off of bad traders. If you just buy and refuse to sell at some lower price, it doesn't really matter, you're immune to the this cycle.

Or you could just manage your finances like a sane person. I bought bitcoin pretty low. Didn't expect it to go up anywhere near as much as it did. Got lucky. I knew it was going to crash like this. I can't predict if and when the price will reach those levels again. I'm holding onto a large chunk of the BTC I bought for mostly ideological reasons. I'm happy with what I made from selling at various points during the bubble. The rest of my finances are unrelated to crypto. If bitcoin goes to zero it will be disappointing but not devastating to my bank account. I'd love it if we can get to the point where you don't need one and can rely fully on bitcoin. But we aren't there yet.;1;0;False;;dtw5gxt;Hodlers right now;7vvei1;https://youtu.be/RbpRlYpGtSg
