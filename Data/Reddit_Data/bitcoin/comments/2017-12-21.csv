Hi, Our team has been working mostly passionately on the SEAing Breath project focused on ocean advocacy via virtual reality and deep breathing the past years. It has been presented for free at museums and public places to people all ages and background. Many learned about sea level rise, how to help the oceans and about breathing to lower stress, anxiety and depression for the first time. We would be incredibly grateful for any support! https://seaingbreath.com/2017/02/06/project-mission/ and @seaingbreath on insta. We also developed a breathing VR experience for deep breathing without funding this year: http://www.mishurenko.me/awere Thank you!;1;0;False;hannesbend;drkzelc;I'm donating 5057 BTC to charitable causes!

"Have you considered donating toward mental health for the developmentally disabled?  It's a particularly forgotten realm in the charity space without much glamor, but given that they experience emotion on a spectrum beyond what we're capable of, mental health for them (and their families) is incredibly important.

I submitted an application for them a week ago and haven't heard back from you, though I think about it every day. Please see what you can do, and consider donating! The charity helps those with developmental disabilities achieve mental health through art and hands on workshops and has an amazing track record: http://www.beingstudio.ca/  I recommend spending a few minutes on some of the artist bios!  

Anything will help them really, but they're at a deficit every year now and could really use an endowment. Do you think you'll be donating?  Should I apply again?

PS: I didn't mention this in the application I made but the website is new (formerly H'Art of Ottawa, so if you google that it'll bring you to the new site as well), but the charity is still using H'Art of Ottawa email, and can't afford to have someone set up the new email yet, so don't use the being studio email address because we can't access it - use admin@hartofottawa.ca instead. 

Thank you for reading!

You calculate limits the same way regardless of the value of x. That's the entire reason of using a variable in the first place.

No, percentage of increased profit requires dividing but initial profit, not by the initial investment amount.

Profit can be zero and can also be negative (loss).

So the limit from the left is negative infinity, and the limit from the right is positive infinity. The limit is undefined, just like the result of dividing by zero in the first place.

Look at [the comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7ke4u2/btc_grandpa_already_doubled_his_profit/drdutl1) I initially replied to. 

It says **nothing** about ROI. 

What it *does* say is ""infinitely **more profit** than he had **originally**.""

(ironic how you just told me to ""read the fucking thread,"" though.)

""infinitely more profit"" means ""profit2 is infinite percent larger than profit1.""

You find the percentage of increase (or decrease) by taking the difference and dividing by profit1. 

(p2 - p1) /p1

In this case, profit1 is no profit at all, or zero.

That makes the percentage calculation:

(9,000 - 0) / 0 = undefined

"**Return on investment**

Return on Investment (ROI) is the benefit to an investor resulting from an investment of some resource. A high ROI means the investment's gains compare favorably to its cost. As a performance measure, ROI is used to evaluate the efficiency of an investment or to compare the efficiencies of several different investments. In purely economic terms, it is one way of relating profits to capital invested.

"I wouldn't say they are lying to themselves, as much as trying to placate themselves. What they're trying to do is make the most of their limited psychological health.

It is true that for some it doesn't buy happiness. Just ask anyone with depression so severe they can't even feel any emotion whatsoever. They probably wouldn't even respond to a billion dollars, much less a million. Or those who suffer from major PTSD.

If you're psychologically healthy (I know I am not, so count me out), then sure, it might buy happiness, up to a certain point and past that point it doesn't make much difference. The $75K per year, comfortable lifestyle, is roughly that threshold where increasing money won't actually improve psychological health.

I have a very comfortable lifestyle, objectively speaking - plenty of nutritious meals, security, creature comforts, plenty of free time since I work only 16 hours a week, yet I am still depressed and feel flat most days, some days feeling terrible.

But then again, I've spent nearly half of my life on antipsychotics, antidepressants and even drugs for epilepsy.

"I think I have to keep mine. 
BCH just got added to Coinbase !!
""Starting at a certain block on Aug 1 they started mining new blocks with a different protocol. So if you had unspent transaction outputs (bitcoin money) then you have BCH on this new fork. Both BCH and BTC kept mining blocks with different protocols (BCH has bigger blocksize). It’s funny cause it looks like you just got money out of thin air. In October or November there was yet another fork from BTC called Bitcoin Gold. (BCG). If you have bitcoin from before that timeframe you also have BTG. Since Coinbase doesn’t support it at the moment you’re not hearing too much about it. One BTG is about $490 as I’m typing this up right now. I have no idea what will happen going forward with that. It’s all pretty crazy right now. So entertaining!""

"I'm not a shill. I hold no BCH and wouldn't benefit at all from shilling. 

You cannot read, I never said they thought they needed to pay 60k to get in.

From purely a business perspective:

The company knew that one of the reasons people are resistant to BTC is because of the high price per coin. It might not be true that they need to get whole number of coins, but psychologically if you can only get a small amount if feels worse than getting a higher amount worth the same in fiat. If you have $10000 and someone tells you about bitcoin, and you can get either 0.5BTC or 3BCH, most uninformed people will choose the BCH.

The company knows that very rare that people buy <$100 usd worth of btc because fees eat that up very fast, which reduces the pool of possible customers to people who have quite a lot of excess funds.

All companies aim to make money. Adding BCH was a good business move.

No need to be all insulting you fuckhead.

"I think your Deloitte opinion covers the ""fork I didn't touch argument"". If you know of the fork and its value but choose not to do anything, you may still be in a high-risk position in regards to the IRS. When an exchange dumps the fork coins in your account its hard to argue you are not in control of them. As for random forks, if it has no value, or really under $600 in real market value at the time of fork, there is a good argument to be made that you are not required to report it. My point generally is about how Coinbase handled this situation and how it has negative tax impact for their account holders. edit: those rulings are the same that are referenced in the Deloitte report you posted.

I feel that Deloitte is saying the same thing I am. The only exception they are making is if you lack dominion as outlined in Glenshaw Glass then no income is due. As my original point is related to how Coinbase handled this, when they credited it to your account, you met the three factors in the Glenshaw Glass test. Mear knowledge of a fork and its value may be enough to meet all of the Glenshaw factors. ;1;0;False;andy378;drjlxp9;Coordinated bitcoin dump + network attack with high fees + coinbase adding Bcash...

The LN is designed to be used is that you will use two on-chain transactions (like you said to open and settle a channel), but you would then do as many LN transactions within that channel *instead of using the blockchain directly* for you transfers and spending (and receiving).

Typically, you might put some bitcoin in an LN channel, then use that channel for a long time for dozens or hundreds of transactions before eventually settling it. So, if utilised well, you could use LN to do hundreds of transactions with only 2 on-chain transactions.

"Source? 

Two years ago segwit was speculative, it's only been a dead cert since the middle of this year, and it's only been a requirement in the last month or so. I'd wager that few other companies have as much at stake with their bitcoin implementation as Coinbase do. A tiny mistake would cost their entire business model.

I genuinely struggle to see the conspiracy theory here. Are coinbase not supposed to add altcoins? Are they obliged to announce an exact date for each one? It's not even an effective way to pump the altcoin, could totally have gone either way. 

A much better way to pump BCH would be to add it to your platform with no fees (like Bitstamp have) - yet nobody labels that a conspiracy.";3;0;False;bitcoind3;drkq1mu;Day 2: I will repost this guide daily until available solutions like Segwit & order batching are adopted, the mempool is empty once again, and transaction fees are low.

"That's a great question!

Economists presume that companies are rational. Instead of thinking ""Coinbase are really dumb for not implementing Segwit, it must be costing them fees"" they invert the logic ""I can see that coinbase are paying extra in fees rather than implement segwit - I know they aren't dumb, there must be a reason for this. Perhaps the cost of implementing that solution is more than the fees lost?"".

Economists can actually offer insight in to all sorts of things this way.

"CNBC, coinbase and roger are all very intimately linked to bcash. they are currently trying to steal as much market share from bitcoin as they possibly can by spreading fud about bitcoin (and dumping) and promoting bcash (and pumping)

so yes they do care about sabotaging bitcoin. hell roger has pretty much straight up come out and admited to it like a shitty comic book villain. he really really wants to kill bitcoin and make his own shitty version the ""real"" bitcoin

for coinbase and cnbc, it isnt as obvious, but if you read between the lines, look at how they are acting and who they assosciate with it become pretty clear that they are pushing bcash hard. you really dont have to be a genius to figure this one out. 


for example: on the day bcash suddenly start trading (even though its not supposed to go up until jan and withdraw only) roger ver gets invited on to cnbc fast money to promote hist bcash shitcoin, and talk about how shitty bitcoin is... the marketing manager of CNBCs husband is the director of the bitcoin chash fund. all the while the price oddly is 3x what it is on any other exchange, but nobody can sell cause they turned it off (cause they dont want it to crash hard) cant make this shit up

"But that's basically equivalent to Coinbase's issue: I'm sure their underlying infrastructure is Segwit-ready. It's just a matter of deploying it to the point end-users can use it.

So if you want to apply a conspiracy theory to Coinbase's delay in deploying Segwit, that same theory should apply to Core (particularly given that adding it to the UI should have a lot less risk than adding the feature in the first place, giving Core little excuse for the delay in rolling it out).

Nota bene: I think neither Core nor Coinbase is a bad actor here. Core misjudged on the importance of getting Segwit adoption.

"100% Segwit would increase the transactions per second. If a few hours or a couple of days enough time would pass to clear the current mempool. At that point, there would be spare room in future blocks and it would be possible to again include transactions with very low/no fees, similar to what it possible with Bitcoin Cash right now.

People will start doing more transactions and eventually, we'll be back to where we are now, but Segwit could delay that until Lightening is ready. Imo, lets try it.

"> However, they’re not in a hurry anymore because they realize that even if transaction fees are halved (to like $10), it is still too expensive to buy things day-to-day, so it wouldn't become a significant portion of their business.

the point is, that the network would probably not be congested if segwit was widely used and fees would therefore go down to cents, (<20 sat/b). Doubling the blocksize (with segwit) doesn't mean halving of the fees. That's not how bitcoin works. If capacity is bigger than demand, fees are close to zero.

Obviously miners can spam the network at basically no cost and force everyone to overpay. This problem will not go away unfortunately as long as the blockreward dwarfs the transaction fees.

Unfortunately nobody ever expected the miners to be so insanely shortsighted and hostile towards bitcoin. It seems like the vast majority of them are only interested in turning a quick buck today and give zero fucks about tomorrow.

"Before the Lightning Network can solve scaling problems, we first need to prepare the community for the responsibility of operating secure nodes. Transacting on LN is an active process and nodes require access to the unencrypted private keys used to manage their channels. If a node is compromised the available balance on open channels is exposed to theft. This is a significant difference from the offline transacting supported by Bitcoin. To get the full benefits of LN, users will not simply be able to secret away their private keys on airgapped hardware wallets.

All scaling solutions can only be measured against the current level of demand for transactions. Saying that future adoption will bring higher demand for transactions in the future is equally an argument against all scaling solutions other than an unlimited blocksize. Making the block size limit 4MB or 20MB are equally inadequate against the argument that we should have support for the level of transactions we might see if adoption grows to a point where that's not big enough to clear the mempool out. ;1;1;False;pepe_le_shoe;drku10b;Day 2: I will repost this guide daily until available solutions like Segwit & order batching are adopted, the mempool is empty once again, and transaction fees are low.

"Yep, but saying this here is shouting against the tide, no point in doing it.

Segwit is a bandaid on a gunshot wound. It needs proper care and likely an operation, lightning network is the doctor that can fix it.

That doctor is on vacation in the swiss alps. Maybe the patient will live by the time he gets back, maybe the patient will die. But he will bleed and he will get worse.

How big does the mempool need to get before people realize its a problem that can't be fixed by getting an echo chamber to adopt a poor solution? 300k? 400k?

How high does the average transaction fee need to get? $30? $40? Its at $42 right now. 

How high does the difficulty need to be before people realize there's an issue? It goes up 18% every two weeks. Its meant to. 2t? 3t?

4 difficulty adjustments (2 months) from now, if usage continues at this rate, the mempool will be 600k+. Transactions will be $100. They were $5 earlier this month.

"> If I want to send my Bread funds to a bech32 Electrum address, I have do do something extra than I would with a regular transaction?

To send funds to a native SegWit address, the sending wallet needs to understand the new address format. Apparently, outside of Electrum, there is also the Samourai wallet, but any other wallet would reject bech32 addresses as invalid.

The easiest way to fund a native Segwit wallet today is probably to import an existing wallet into Electrum itself, and then move the funds from the old wallet to the new one. Otherwise, you would have to wait for your current wallet to be updated to support the new address format.

> Can bech32 addresses send to non segwit addresses and vice versa?

The short answer is ""yes"".

The long answer is, if the receiving wallet doesn't have SegWit support, the transaction might not be visible until after it is confirmed, and even then, it could potentially glitch out somehow since it wouldn't know how to interpret the sending address format. A well-coded wallet should handle it gracefully, but I couldn't make any guarantees for any particular wallet. The funds should not be lost in any case.

There is a reason the P2SH-nested formats exist, and personally, while I do have a native SegWit Electrum wallet that I've played around with for a bit, I wouldn't use it to send payments to someone else quite yet, unless they actually provided a bech32 address.";5;1;False;ArmchairCryptologist;drky0ag;Day 2: I will repost this guide daily until available solutions like Segwit & order batching are adopted, the mempool is empty once again, and transaction fees are low.

"First, this is from March, 2016, second, he expresses that he has doubts that Segwit is the proper scaling solution (it's not, it's a stepping stone towards LN) but in the meantime Segwit has been implemented, and it's irresponsible to stubbornly stick to his doubts because Segwit has been implemented and it's important that he does all he can to support BTC scaling as far as possible, otherwise he is (perhaps unwillingly) acting as a Bcash agent.

Agreed 100%.  But we're not at the ideal.  The current reality is that most services don't support it, so most users don't benefit from it.  The only way you can benefit from it is if you know what it is and seek out the few services that do support it.  If you don't know what it is, you're probably using the popular services and software that don't support it, and your user experience sucks right now (high fees, slow confirmations).

"Checked out your link.  I can't follow the conclusion you're drawing.  Are you saying that because literally 2 people are paying 500 sat/B, 2 @ 550, and 2 at 600 are paying extra (read: not necessary)  fees, that BCH is a failed experiment?  I don't follow that logic at all.  Anyone can put in any fee they want.  For instance, when I sold some of my bitcoin a few weeks ago, I transferred 32 BTC with a fee of 815 sat/byte; why? Because the extra money simply wasn't worth the risk of not having my tx confirm.  Did I have to pay that much?  Nope.  My point is: just because high TX fees were paid, doesn't mean the the network is congested (or even that it was necessary).


In short: I'm not seeing what you're seeing.  6 x 500 sat/b TX does not congestion make.


Oh, also keep calling me a shill and also please keep assuming I make less than you.  It's really funny from my perspective (_Who's the Roger Ver, now?_).

I'm saying that when there are so few people actually transacting with bcash, and people are still overpaying fees - Roger Ver's biggest talking point being the cost of fees mind you - then it's not block size that is the fee problem. Yes, you overpaid. Many others overpay. That's the high fee part of the problem. The other part of the problem is congestion of blocks, which is primarily caused by large numbers of inefficient transaction (ie uncompressed addresses, no segwit, etc). If all of those variables were not a factor, there would be no congestion, and no high fees, and no whiny Roger Ver character complaining that Bitcoin is broken. On top of that - bcash, which is is nothing but a waste of network bandwidth and mining resources. Bitcoin is working as designed. ;1;0;False;Alan2420;drl9w3q;Day 2: I will repost this guide daily until available solutions like Segwit & order batching are adopted, the mempool is empty once again, and transaction fees are low.

To make the most use of the Lightning Network a node must be online at all times with automated access to its unencrypted keys. That is far different than how most users secure their Bitcoin wallets.

"What do you not get? This is basic basic math.

LN requires the user to at some point Load and Settle to use the LN.

So assume the only TX on the main chain was just those loads and settlements.

We have a max of 146 million TX per year on the main chain.

So 72 million total LN channels loaded and settled.

If we have 20 million users of bitcoin. They get to do this 3x each max per year. That does not explain how to get the bitcoins to use them, not account for mining which is also done on the main chain.

"> Is there a command line interface method to get a Segwit address in Bitcoin Core?

> If so, what are the steps :)

#You can find those answers HERE :

https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/57832/how-to-generate-segwit-address

> How do I generate a SegWit address using Bitcoin Core CLI?

You can use ""addwitnessaddress addr"", where addr is an existing P2PKH or P2SH address of yours. It will construct a P2SH-P2WPKH or P2SH-P2WSH address with the same key/script, if known to be valid.

Note that this command is not available until SegWit is active on the network, as before that time, such outputs would be spendable by everyone.

In a future version Bitcoin Core may switch to using such addresses by default.

> Also will I be able to redeem those outputs and send them to a ""legacy"" address?

Yes.

> If so, will this second transaction be accepted by older, non-SegWit clients?

Yes, it is a softfork. Every new transaction is valid according to the old rule. If not, a chain split would occur. Older clients may not see the transaction until it is confirmed, however.

"/u/djgreedo is correct on this regard.  Think of LN as a prepaid giftcard: you load it with funds, then make multiple purchases with it over time to the same vendor.  The additional feature is that once you spend any amount of the money on your gift card, you can get a refund on the remaining amount back.  Additionally, if you don't use all of the funds on your prepaid giftcard after its expiration date, you get it the balance back as BTC.  (If you don't spend any money on your gift card, though, you won't be able to get any of it back until its expiration.)

However, while having its use-cases, LN is *NOT* going to resolve all of the TX Congestion.  The LN only mitigates repeat transactions to/from the same parties.  So if most of the transactions on the network are unique sender/receiver pairs, then the number of transactions is actually going to double if they used LN (one TX to open the channel, and one to close it).";2;0;False;FerriestaPatronum;drks620;Day 2: I will repost this guide daily until available solutions like Segwit & order batching are adopted, the mempool is empty once again, and transaction fees are low.

"Because nothing is ever that easy.

You can't scale a site like coinbase by just ""adding more servers"", there's no button to hit to say ""make it go faster!"".

Engineering around a trading system that runs 24/7 with a stupid amount of transactions per second is really really really hard to do. You can't use tricks like eventual consistency (reddit uses this, if you comment then reload the page real quick, your comment won't show up, but if you reload again it will. Coinbase can't do that), sharding (facebook does this, you and your friends posts are stored on the same servers, while some guy in india and his friends are on a server in india, and while you 2 can talk, it will be slower than those closer to you, coinbase can't do that), and lax timing (chat applications use this, where it won't matter if 2 messages sent at ALMOST the same time can show up in a random order, coinbase can'd do that either).


They need to have all transactions be instant, NEVER make mistakes, never be out of order, never be slower for some than others, and the data that users can see must be what they can act on, not the data from a few seconds ago.

It doesn't matter if you have billions to throw at the problem, you aren't going to solve it in a week, or month, or even a few years in most cases. It takes time, testing, and careful planning to get to that point. And coinbase hasn't had the time to do that, since they are growing at such a stupidly fast rate.";26;2;False;Klathmon;drkqjao;Day 2: I will repost this guide daily until available solutions like Segwit & order batching are adopted, the mempool is empty once again, and transaction fees are low.

"A concern I have: If everyone implement segwit, then the backlog is cleared. However, right now people are keeping their transaction at a minimum due to the high fees. If the fees are low again, then won't people start buying / selling (or even using) BTC more frequently, which would then increase the # of transactions again? It's like when they widen highways, but then traffic still sucks because then more people want to use the highways.

EDIT: Good responses overall, I just want to be clear that I'm not saying we shouldn't implement segwit. I just wanted to be realistic with how much it will help. I think segwit will help with transaction fees for the purposes being used right now (store of value / investment), but lightning network is what needs to succeed to use it as a currency.

"> If every transaction in the Bitcoin network was a SegWit transaction today, blocks would contain up to 8,000 transactions, and the 138,000 unconfirmed transaction backlog would disappear instantly. Transaction fees would be almost non-existent once again.

I don't think this is true, because the demand for Bitcoin transactions is not perfectly inelastic. If transactions were practically free again, people would make more of them (since there's less of a financial barrier to making them), and the increased number would fill up even the larger available capacity with Segwit.

"I've seen this question posed before, although usually it's not a question it's an accusation. ""If we make Bitcoin throughput better, people will just use it more and fill the mempool all over"" is partially possible, though I don't think it's any reason not to push forward and make the throughput better.

The community is, hopefully, learning that bitcoin, while unfragile, has a network that is very fragile in it's usefulness. LN will solve a lot of these issues if it goes as well as people are imagining, but Segwit is the first step, and we need to be pushing for it now to at least temporarily alleviate the problem.

The last time the mempool was clear was October. Think about that... we've been dealing with this issue for two months now, and every bit of focus on it takes away focus from future implementations past Segwit. Let's get Segwit adoption, so we can stop worrying about it and continue scaling through solutions like LN. Eventually, we'll have enough throughput that we can stop worrying.

We have thousands of new people coming into Bitcoin each day, so even with Segwit fully adopted there will not be enough capacity for all these people to use Bitcoin with low fees, which in my opinion takes away a big justification for a high Bitcoin price.

Electrum only supports wallets with the transitional P2SH-P2WPKH format if you use it with a hardware wallet or use an external program to generate a BIP39 seed, which is somewhat non-intuitive and rather user-unfriendly. Since native bech32-style Segwit addresses aren't supported by most (any?) other wallets yet, moving any coins to such a wallet in the first place requires jumping through some hoops.;16;3;False;ArmchairCryptologist;drkmmpf;Day 2: I will repost this guide daily until available solutions like Segwit & order batching are adopted, the mempool is empty once again, and transaction fees are low.

The 0.15.1 release was planned to be the release that implements full Segwit support in the wallet. But then the whole 2X thing happened, and the devs had to use their time and ressources to make sure that the network isn't going to get disrupted by the 2X nodes going live. This was necessary because the 2X guys refused to implement proper mechanisms that would have made the fork go smoothly for both sides, either because of incompetence or because of intentional malice.

"Those priorities are reasonable. It's not to say segwit is unimportant, but if you fail at the first two, your business is done.

Security should go without question as the ongoing top priority. One major breach and goodbye Coinbase.

Given the outages during major trading spikes, it's justifiable to have performance at #2. Coinbase has some scaling issues they need to addresses.

So segwit at #3 makes sense.

Their engineering team is big enough that they should be tacking all three concurrently.

"Non-Segwit can send to Segwit, no problem. This is just an Electrum issue.

The problem is that when Electrum implemented Segwit, they did it by implementing Bech32 addresses, which is a an upcoming standard which is hardly implemented by anyone else.

Basically Electrum jumped *two* steps ahead (to Bech32) instead of just one step ahead (to plain vanilla Segwit).

While it is awesome that Electrum is super early with support for Bech32, it is really annoying that they tried to skip implementing  vanilla Segwit addresses, because the current situation is exactly as you describe it, that you have to continue using non-segwit with Electrum, even though they have support for segwit, because their futuristic Bech32/segwit implementation cannot receive coins from virtually anyone whose wallets just respond ""wut is dis?

If a man advises another to do something, and then does the complete opposite himself, I don't think it's controversial to question his motives for that advice. Ver emphasised that he's free to do whatever he wants, there's no crime there.

2. Keep your coins on a private wallet and not be able to transfer to an exchange in time if the market turns against you.

Not calling it bitcoin is an insult to him because he is a delusional narcissist that thinks it is somehow a matter of opinion whether or not the minority fork bitcoin cash is actually the real bitcoin and bitcoin is some alternate version imaginarily named ""bitcoin core"", because it more closely aligns with his personal interpretation of the original concept.

Finally copying code without understanding it is also pretty risky, BCH purposely chose not to integrate Segwit for undisclosed reasons.

">  As a free individual I should be free to do whatever I like with my own hardware as long as I don't hurt anyone else. Copyright prevents this, it's an excuse to intrude on my freedom to privately use the things I own in ways I see fit, using state violence to stop me if necessary.

Sorry, how does copyright prevent you from using your hardware in any way you like? You seem to be conflating copyright and DRM.

> Copying is easy. Back when copying was hard, copyright took very few freedoms away from people in order to encourage creation by the middle class. Nowadays copying is much easier, so we're taking away huge freedoms and conveniences from ordinary people. This is largely done in the name of false claims to moral rights.

Just because copying is easy doesn't give you the moral right to copy and give someone else's work away for free, it is up to the author of the work to decide how that work is distributed. There certainly has been anti consumer moves made by the US gov in the name of appeasing copyright holders but this is largely limited to the US.

> Sharing with your peers is moral. People who prevent sharing or claim that it is immoral are preventing moral acts for their own greedy and selfish reasons, thus are acting immorally. (The moral claim around copyright is different to that of plagiarism, which is lying and akin to fraud)

Your argument is that a content creators right to make a living off their product is trumped by your right to give their product away for free? This is something I do not agree with.

> Copyright allows the publishing industry to capture and own the culture, which should be public not a private resource. Every song from your youth, every book you've read and every character in those books, every part of the culture will be owned for your entire life. Private companies have levied a tax not just on what you dance to and what you talk about, but on your nostalgia. This was far worse before the Internet.

This is an argument against corporatism, not copyright. Copyright is being extended far longer than justifiable IMHO copyright should last until the author (or last author in a group) dies.

> Copyright is great for funding and this leads to large and expensive works being the norm. This tends towards centralization of cultural power, it splits society into producers and consumers and the producers are funded by established powers. This leads to a top-down culture shaped by the establishment rather than a bottom-up one built by the people, a culture steered by corporate and government propagandists.

"Yes, /u/Zarutian . Actually, BTC price doesn't even matter that much.

I have perfected my attack, and I think it can be done with 5% of BTC mining power (or less).

The idea is - since BCH mining difficulty is a weighted moving average of 144 last blocks, one can direct some small mining power to BCH chain, and mine at a very slight loss. Just enough for other miners to leave for a while to mine BTC. It can be done smoothly within 24h hours, probably less than that at little cost - you are earning BCH after all. There is a peak point somewhere in the middle of that 24 hours, where difficulty starts to ramp up, and a lot of mining power will leave at once: just like it is happening already and why BCH blocks have longer gaps and are choppy sometimes. Now you fork in secret, and start mining. As soon as you have a decent head-start (two blocks), you send your BCH everywhere and start trading. You do in everywhere that trades BCH. Changelly, Shapeshift are especially good since you don't need anything there, and they are using underlying exchanges to do the swapping. You can do it on some personal and suck-puppet accounts too - there is no proof of anything. You can always say you were arbitraging. You don't bank accounts etc. You have 4-8 hours before the weighted average starts going down again.

The total cost of BTC you didn't mine is like $70k per hour of the attack (5% of the 1.5MM/hour mining payout rate) . A steal. How much can you double spend in couple of hours? Fat millions on all the exchanges trading BCH. I'm sure I'm not the only one that have this figured out, and I will be very surprised if it will not be done. On top of that you can short BCH somewhere on margin to amplify your payouts.

Whether the unannounced launch of trading was manipulative practice is subjective.

Either way, this comment was specifically regarding insider trading beyond the scope of just crypto, and whether it should be accepted practice. And less about whether the situation was insider trading. 

Whether it be crypto or stocks, insider trading is one that benefits those who are most well connected, and individuals who tend to be in a position to benefit the most are probably ones in the upper tiers of society than average people. And insider trading always goes for bad news too, so insiders can unload holdings before things crash.

"I'm not an ancap but I disagree with the entire notion of copyright because I believe it is harmful.

1. As a free individual I should be free to do whatever I like with my own hardware as long as I don't hurt anyone else. Copyright prevents this, it's an excuse to intrude on my freedom to privately use the things I own in ways I see fit, using state violence to stop me if necessary.
2. Copying is easy. Back when copying was hard, copyright took very few freedoms away from people in order to encourage creation by the middle class. Nowadays copying is much easier, so we're taking away huge freedoms and conveniences from ordinary people. This is largely done in the name of false claims to moral rights.
3. Sharing with your peers is moral. People who prevent sharing or claim that it is immoral are preventing moral acts for their own greedy and selfish reasons, thus are acting immorally. (The moral claim around copyright is different to that of plagiarism, which is lying and akin to fraud)
4. Copyright allows the publishing industry to capture and own the culture, which should be public not a private resource. Every song from your youth, every book you've read and every character in those books, every part of the culture will be owned for your entire life. Private companies have levied a tax not just on what you dance to and what you talk about, but on your nostalgia. This was far worse before the Internet.
5. Copyright is great for funding and this leads to large and expensive works being the norm. This tends towards centralization of cultural power, it splits society into producers and consumers and the producers are funded by established powers. This leads to a top-down culture shaped by the establishment rather than a bottom-up one built by the people, a culture steered by corporate and government propagandists.";1;1;False;david-song;drkf9nr;"""I think insider trading is a non-crime""-Roger Ver";7l55ey;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7s7-09-oms

"*My Internet Credibility has been challenged.*

I've now got an even stronger desire to do this. I was toying with the idea of doing it yesterday, but now I'm determined. My honor and integrity depend on it.

Here's the problem I've run in to, though. The lowest amount I can buy on my exchange is 1039.0625, at the current rate (which of course is subject to change). That's all of $7.82, so not that big a deal. Weirdly, it won't let me sell what should be the lowest possible amount to sell of the other coin I have on that exchange (I've not got much on this one), so I ended up selling .0013-and-a-bit BTC worth and buying 2704.24328125 DOGE instead of 100.

It's a slightly larger amount than I had planned, but what could I do, y'know? The next issue was finding a good picture of Doge, which I actually struggled with. I had to make do with a lower quality image than I would have liked, but it'll have to do.

The next step is the wallet, which I'm making now. I'll update in a bit when things are a bit more put together, since I just noticed another redditor kindly offering to help find a good image of the dogecoin. I may ask if you'd be willing to send an amount of DOGE to the wallet that would round it off to a 'pretty' number, be it only 96 to push it to 2800 [roughly] even, or if you're feeling super-generous 296 to put it at 3000. You don't actually have to worry about that though, lol. I'm a bit anal about things like that, but I just didn't think to buy 2900 instead of 2740~ when I was buying the doge in the first place, and it's not really worth going back to make two more $40~ dollar transactions to fix the mistake. :/";1;1;False;Mausoleum-Monger;drl12jp;"""I think insider trading is a non-crime""-Roger Ver";7l55ey;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7s7-09-oms

But bitcoin being just means for a fast and cheap payment, isn't what the true function and value of bitcoin iso (IMO).

So measures that might be detrimental to this ""neutrality of money"" must be avoided, even if they don't cause immediate detriment. And raising blocksize now in order to alleviate the congestion, when there's other measures that can bring the same result (segwit makes txs smaller, thus more can fit in the same blocksize), can (and will) turn out to be detrimental to the neutrality and decentralization of bitcoin.

"Hopefully you don't mind, I find this interesting, so the post kind of wanders.

On lemons, I don't think it applies; there is a clear victim if someone lies about their car before selling it. The victim of insider trading is hard to find. It's not the person who bought the stock, since they put in an order without knowing about who was selling or not that day. They could have bought it from anyone, since stocks are commodified. The victim is all stockholders, collectively. Yet the vast majority of the cost borne by stockholders is due to the actual company being bankrupt. In fact, had the insider trading not occurred, everyone who bought stocks that day would have had to pay a bit extra for their stock. 

However, a better argument for your side is if the insider trader bought a ton of put options at high price from a market maker. The people holding those would be super screwed and clearly identifiable. I think it would make more sense to punish people who do those trades than public stock trading. However, that isn't what happened with Coinbase.

Also, it's worth noting that lemons are an information asymmetry problem regardless of whether selling them is immoral. Like even if you're a nice person and tell everyone who inquires all the problems with your car, they may think you are still hiding something, since everyone has to assume the car may be a lemon. Thus, we need other ways around this market failure. Government is one method, but it's got its own issues, not very agile, subject to political graft, etc. A better one is cheap inspections offered by local mechanics, which help fix the problem.  Another is companies like CarMax, which have a national corporate reputation that would be damaged if they sold lemons. 

The point being that long-run, as I mentioned before, allowing insider trading might actually be beneficial, as information leaks more freely when there are clear incentives to leak it. 

> If youre a 90 year old woman and have a 1967 ferrari GTO that you've listed as a pontiac gto, and I recognized that and buy it from you for 10x less than market value because youre misinformed about the true value, is that immoral?

Well, information is valuable, and I don't think it's practical to expect everyone to have perfect information all the time (this is a consequentialist argument). It doesn't feel like you're an outstanding person, but just because someone lists something for cheap on craigslist doesn't seem like it should require you to tell them it's worth more. Maybe they know that, but are moving this week, maybe they have two of something and the second one just isn't worth the effort to talk to lots of buyers. And shouldn't anyone selling know not to take the first offer? In this example, no one is being forced to sell anything, so there's certainly not much of a deontological libertarian argument against it either.

In some sense, everyone in trade has access to information the other person doesn't have; this is the source of consumer surplus. You can buy cold medicine for cheap at a local pharmacy because the pharmacy has no way to price discriminate between rich people who are feeling terrible with a cold and would pay $200 for Sudafed, and someone who is cheap and only buying it just in case for $10 or whatever it normally is. This results in huge consumer surpluses on almost every good, yet no one would seriously argue pharmacies or grocery stores are getting ripped off because they can't tell how much you'd be willing to pay for every item. Some renters may be ready to do all sorts of bad things to an apartment, while some will leave it in perfect condition. Is this unfair that the landlord doesn't know what kind of renter their tenant will be? I don't think so. So then what makes insider trading economically special?

"**Dijkstra's algorithm**

Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks. It was conceived by computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1956 and published three years later.

The algorithm exists in many variants; Dijkstra's original variant found the shortest path between two nodes, but a more common variant fixes a single node as the ""source"" node and finds shortest paths from the source to all other nodes in the graph, producing a shortest-path tree.

For a given source node in the graph, the algorithm finds the shortest path between that node and every other.

"**Ad hominem**

Ad hominem (Latin for ""to the man"" or ""to the person""), short for argumentum ad hominem, is an argumentative strategy whereby an argument is rebutted by attacking the character, motive, or other attribute of the person making the argument, or persons associated with the argument, rather than attacking the substance of the argument itself.

However, its original meaning was an argument ""calculated to appeal to the person addressed more than to impartial reason"".

Fallacious ad hominem reasoning is categorized as an informal fallacy, more precisely as a genetic fallacy, a subcategory of fallacies of irrelevance.

However, in some cases, ad hominem attacks can be non-fallacious; i.e., if the attack on the character of the person is directly tackling the argument itself.

"> Sorry, how does copyright prevent you from using your hardware in any way you like?

It denies me the legal right to create derived works, derived works were the default mode of all cultural progression before widespread copyright. DRM is an implementation detail, restrictions management exists within the framework of copyright protection.

> Just because copying is easy doesn't give you the moral right to copy and give someone else's work away for free

I disagree. Once someone has published their work they no longer own it, any control over other people is done through artificial constructs created by our legal system. Copyright is not a moral rights, but part of the [copyright bargain](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/misinterpreting-copyright.html). The morality of copyright ownership is a marketing position pushed by the copyright industry, and it's foolish to swallow their propaganda without carefully dissecting it. Holding the meme does not benefit you as a consumer or society as a whole, it's marketing that exists to benefit the various copyright industries.

> Your argument is that a content creators right to make a living off their product is trumped by your right to give their product away for free?

No. I would just prefer that they work for an honest wage. For example switching to a model where they get paid for actually working rather than being paid by a stealth tax on the population. In a free society everyone has a right to make a living, but they don't have a right to demand money from me when I have no business with them. If a friend shares something with me then that's between me and my friend, not third parties who lay dubious claims on my private communications.

> Copyright is being extended far longer than justifiable IMHO copyright should last until the author (or last author in a group) dies.

This is a more reasonable stance but it doesn't go far enough IMO, but that aside a fixed-length term would be easier to deal with contractually.

> This is just patently false, if this were true indie films, music, game etc... would never be made.

Sorry but I disagree fundamentally if I create something I share it with others under my terms.

> Copyright is not a moral rights, but part of the [copyright bargain](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/misinterpreting-copyright.html). The morality of copyright ownership is a marketing position pushed by the copyright industry, and it's foolish to swallow their propaganda without carefully dissecting it. Holding the meme does not benefit you as a consumer or society as a whole, it's marketing that exists to benefit the various copyright industries.

Sorry but I disagree fundamentally, if I create something it is up to me how it get used. Society doesn't just automatically get the fruits of my labour.

>No. I would just prefer that they work for an honest wage. For example switching to a model where they get paid for actually working rather than being paid by a stealth tax on the population.

Who exactly is paying me a wage for my work? You are saying that if I release something then society gets the fruits of labour. So is society paying this ""honest wage""?

> In a free society everyone has a right to make a living, but they don't have a right to demand money from me when I have no business with them.

Yes big companies are pushing their own agenda and abusing the legal system to get extremely anti consumer extensions to copyright. I completely agree but to argue that all copyright is immoral is ludicrous.

If youre a 90 year old woman and have a 1967 ferrari GTO that you've listed as a pontiac gto, and I recognized that and buy it from you for 10x less than market value because youre misinformed about the true value, is that immoral?

The problem with insider trading is that, by definition, one party is privy to information that the other party cant be. If you have insider knowledge of how a company operates, what their future looks like, news that will affect the share price, whatever, by entering into a transaction with someone who doesnt, you are using that information to manipulate them into a transaction that they otherwise would not make. The difference between 2 non insiders trading the day before a big event is that neither has that information so both parties in the transaction are on equal ground. So going back to the first example, if both of us know the engine is bad, then its not immoral, if neither of us knows the engine is bad then its not immoral. This is why its not ""insider trading"" to opt out of an employee stock purchase program before a company goes bankrupt, or to exercise options based on insider information (as long as you dont trade them in the open market afterwards, or sell some to cover the purchase price) because both parties in the transaction (you and the company) have total knowledge of the companies situation. Its the involvement of a third party not privy to the insider information that makes it illegal and immoral.

You've got to wonder if all of the folks behind crypto currencies have taken a *finance 101* course before. 

So insider trading is OK (doesn't really instill confidence in a platform or its founder...but alright), and even if people were insider trading, after they trade (and make their money), now the market crashes, and truly reflects what the value of the currency is.

"My two cents... 

How so bcash supporters think someone calling themselves “bitcoin Jesus” is s good marketing strategy. Sure, like maybe a crypto enthusiast comedian calling himself bitcoin Jesus but somebody who is attempting to portray himself as a respectable business man? It sounds ridiculous 

Also, I think bcash people are giving to much credit to the coming wave of adopters... those people have no idea what the fuck he is talking about. 

I think this just muddies his own waters. I think the next wave hear that interview and the take away is “bitcoin is not as good as the others for some reason I can’t understand” 

I think this could push people more toward the other alts... ether, ltc, ripple.

I would like insider trading to be legal. As an investor, this would give me confidence that the stocks are priced based on all available knowledge, and thus fairly. As an investor you are not obliged to buy or sell your stocks. If a bad quarterly result is about to be announced, after the information is traded on, the stock will drop in value. As a normal investor who holds the stock, you will no matter what be hit by this. The only difference is whether it happens earlier because the CEO has started selling some shares, or later when the info is made public and all investors start to value it at less. I would rather see the share drop in price to the fair value earlier, than continue trading at too high value because there is bad information, yet to be released.;-1;0;False;BroccoBaba;drkq7w6;"""I think insider trading is a non-crime""-Roger Ver";7l55ey;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7s7-09-oms

"This guy is 100% correct in some respects.   Even if Lightning network is coming:  Bitcoin desperately needs a block size increase,  and quickly,  otherwise  the Bitcoin Core may be quickly obsoleted  within the marketplace  due the increasingly insane wait times and fees.

It doesn't even matter if Lightning network is a better solution,  should Core come to a standstill....  it will be like the VHS vs Betamax argument,  and  LTC, or BCH, or ETH could become the successor  because BTC stopped working.

That doesn't preclude whichever crypto takes over from BTC implementing the LN technology, either.

Ver says, keep bitcoin on an exchange because the price is going to plummet so fast, lightning will work better on bitcoincash which has no segwit, and litecoin is a competitor to bitcoin but its not a competitor to bitcoin cash.

"Roger Ver really really annoys me, and here is a perfect example of why.

Brian Kelly mentioned Bitcoin's intention to release the lightning network for scalability, and asked what Bitcoin Cash's road map and future is like.

Roger Ver then spent 1 minute bashing Bitcoin, said the lightning network would work better on BCH, and didn't answer the question about what BCH's future holds.

Now, unless Ver was basically saying he'd steal the code for lightning network, then he didn't really answer anything - he just sought to bash BTC again.

When he was asked by the interviewer if there is a world where both cryptos can exist, he said there should be, but if BCH siphons enough of the mining hashrate, then BTC will come to a halt.

He said there should be. ""THERE SHOULD BE"". He knows what he's doing. He doesn't want BTC to exist. He wants BCH to be Bitcoin. He doesn't want BTC to exist alongside BCH at all, because how can BTC exist, if you want the name 'Bitcoin'? It can't.

I'm convinced now that Roger Ver is a child that never grew up. I've been trading stocks for quite a while, and while I haven't actually traded any Crypto yet (but I'm up a lot on trading Crypto stocks) any fool who's been around can see what this is. This is a classic pump and dump, with added flavor. The added flavor is that the exchange actually stopped allowing sell orders after allowing a ton of buying. This has the effect of artificially jacking up the price. Roger actually went in on this, with the slimeballs from the Wall Street circuit. How could he be this much of a hypocrite?

My guess is that there will be a huge dump, in the middle of the night (if not sooner) and BCH will crash hard, leaving a ton of newbies holding the bag. Welcome to my world. I just find it amazing that the BCH crowd is acting like this wasn't set up in advance or something. It's called ""Fast Money"" for Christ's sake.

Sure in Ver’s world, there’s conflicts of interest and bad blood... no such thing as cooperating and consensus and community building. Nope, not in Ver’s world.

Also despite his first vision of bcash being as close to the original satoshi's vision - he is now attacking the difficulty adjustment of bitcoin which remains unchanged till today while bcash has changed their difficulty adjustment algorithm.

He has lots of holes in his arguments, if you do your homework, or if you followed bitcoin's story from August (since bcash fork) you would see it all for yourself.

"Coinbase is incompetent but allowing the coin we dislike so much is a suicide. It might destroy it and trigger the next crypto crash, just like MtGox did. Look.

Bitcoin hashing power is around 12-15TH/s. The other coin that uses it is 1-1.5TH. And they use the same algo.

Which means you need maybe 15% of Bitcoins mining power to reliably double spend on the weaker coin. So now that there is a bigger market for the weak coin, any pool can start mining it in secret, send weaker coins to Coinbase, sell them, transfer BTC and other coins outside, and publish the new, now longer weak-coin-blockchain. Kaboom - someone got free money from Coinbase, while it's users are thinking they are holding something. Millions, millions of dollars lost, and Coinbase and their users are holding a bag. Panic. Coinbase gets DDoSed by users trying to withdraw whatever they can.

It takes maybe 1 hour. You could probably do it even with rented mining power. It is 100% reliable. Noone is going to know you're attempting it, until you pull the trigger. And after the trigger - how do you know who did it? You can't! While you're at it, you can kick BitPay too and buy yourself some nice shiny things and get your old coins back. Especially if this attack is carried for hours, it might be devastating. And attacker can see how much ahead they are, while defenders have no idea. You can safely pull the trigger whenever you're done.

On top of it, the danger is always there. The first mining pool to do it, is going to win. It might be already happening this very moment. Any time Bitcoins mining power dips, it might be a pool trying to do it. In fact, V-er and J-i-han can do it any moment without a sweat - I mean, they own the weaker chain mining anyway. After they offload the coins they accumulated, they pull the last trigger. V-er won't cry after Coinbase, just like he didn't cry after MtGox. I wouldn't be surprised if he knew that MtGox was insolvent, and used it to time everything right. That's how he got so rich.

If the fiat supply were doubled, the value of the fiat that you hold would be reduced to half. The same is not true for Bitcoin forks. A recent fork of Bitcoin called Bgold is currently trading at $445. One might argue that Bgold diverted a small amount of value that would have otherwise moved to Bitcoin, but if you held Bitcoin at the time of the Bgold fork, you receive the Bgold for free. ;1;0;False;Bits4Tits;drk6tzk;"""I think insider trading is a non-crime""-Roger Ver";7l55ey;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7s7-09-oms

"Guy wins the lottery, must be a genius. He has this mentality that because he’s rich people should care what he has to say. He’s a hard worker with shit for goals. 

Bitcoin if you really believe in the technology and that it should be decentralized doesn’t care about a community or user experience or trade price it cares about one thing processing transactions and confirming them cryptographically everything else is just nonsense. Here’s what everyone can do to solve this whole issue...stop being sheep 🐑. Make decisions for yourself choose the network you want for you nothing else matters. 

This is the point of bitcoin and crypto as a whole for you to make the decision that’s best for what you want.

"> lightning will work better on bitcoincash which has no segwit

The lightning network merely needs a fix for malleability of which segwit is but one solution.

There are malleability fixes that work on bitcoin cash or any network without segwit.

Hence lightning network will work on bitcoin cash.

Note: Therefore, Lightning network will also work on bitcoin transactions that don't use segwit, if another malleability fix is merged into bitcoin. This could happen as long as it isn't conflicting with segwit code, but unlikely to happen.

">You seem to imply that the ""honest/real miners"" are the ones attacking the network, or changing the consensus rules. That is not what the network considers honest though.

Can you elaborate on this? Let me say this first: When I said SpecialInterest block, I meant a block that is being propogated because of specialInterests, not because it is an actual block that follows all protocol rules. That being said, how would denying a SpecialInterest block be considered attacking the network?

> UASF was not a lesson, or were you not in class that day? Miners+full nodes+users are what makes the network secure. Lots of different miners, lots of full nodes and lots of users.

Okay, i agree that those all things make the network secure. Users are there to feed the miners, i suppose, while the others propogate blocks and check the protocol rules.

"So why isn't a solution 6 months from now sufficient? Are you trying to buy coffee with BTC in the next few months or it's worthless to you despite the massive increases in value? Increasing the block size is a Faustian bargain that undermines decentralization for what, cheaper fees for a couple months on an asset that is exploding in value unless you spend it?

There is already a version of bitcoin with bigger blocks, it's bcash. People can buy that instead if they intend to spend that asset down now or buy low cost items from the few companies that already accept cryptos, and some do just that, but bcash is nowhere near the market share of bitcoin because that's just not at the top of the list for why people want one crypto or another in the next 6 months. But I would guess that no one is buying bcash because they want to buy coffee with it in the next 6 months either, it's just an asset that they speculate will rise in value exactly like bitcoin. But when people choose which asset to park their money in right now they do it partly based on the fundamentals of each crypto, and bcash looks sketchy as fuck from that perspective based not only on serious centralization concerns but on the shitty people at the top of the pyramid (the risk of which even in the hypothetical is at the front of the mind of anyone who cares about decentralization). I don't know how anyone can look at what happened with bcash and GDAX/Coinbase yesterday and not see a highly centralized currency that looks as suspect as any traditional financial structure controlled by the ultra rich.

There are lots of reasons bitcoin is losing market share and I think transactions are a minority of it. The biggest reason is probably because you can't 100x an asset that is already worth over 10k USD and people involved at this early stage are either looking to hold for the next 3+ years or just looking to make huge profits wherever they can get them. As a person with some btc I find the fees pretty annoying, but all I want to do is move a small piece over to speculate on some alts now and then. The market cap is going up so precipitously it seems silly to me to buy anything with cryptos (unless you're a very early adopter that is already sitting on a shitload of value that's all profit), if you bought a car with btc a month ago you could have waited and bought two cars for the same amount today. We are way too early in the development of cryptos currently for anyone to be buying them because they want to use them instead of money *right now*.

". My biggest issue with bitcoin is it being backed by nothing. I’m not super techy but I come from an economic Background. My economic view of the future of crypto will be decentralized currencies that are backed by the production of a good or resource creating an almost barter like approach to the market. 
For example: wheatcoin, silver coin, etc. this is the future. Economically speaking I wanted to get bitcoin to get away from centralized currency that is being manipulated by governments resulting in a loss of purchasing power. A true tell of currency stabilization is it staying non volatile. Bitcoin is turning into exactly what it should not be. An extremely risky short term investment that many may lose their money on. Currency should retain value overtime. For example of uncentralized currency, from 1865-1913 the US dollar would buy the same amount of gold and silver (give or take 1-5 cents) meaning the dollar neither gained or lost value. This is a great currency. Currency needs stabilization. In 1913 the federal reserve started and centralized the monetary supply the price of gold in dollars changed more in the next 6 months than it did in the previous 65 years. Bitcoin is not a currency at all right now. Bitcoin is an internet trend. Currencies that are decentralized and are well constructed do not change in value too much. Going from being worth 1000$ to 20k in one year and currencies like the dollar not having a bad year means bitcoin gained only as a speculative investment not in light of its value in compared to the very currencies its fighting(government currencies) bitcoin and others have so far to go. It has less to do with the technological applications to me and more to do with the actual price stability. Currencies should not change in value and should be be mineable at all times only in retrospect to the amount of people buying in. The currency needs to be pegged to the amount of money flow in in and they should have not stopped the mining of bitcoin. This was centralization, it artificially created a lower supply when there is a high demand leading to this insane price drive so that the top bitcoin users can cash it in for bit cash right before the bubble pops.

">Those UTXO lookups are stored in memory IIRC, or at least btree or similar on the filesystem, so not very expensive. Really doesn't change my point much.

We're now up to _at least_ 0.5 seconds of verification per hop (assuming all the nodes are decent machines and aren't also doing other stuff, of course, like relaying transactions) plus _at least_ 1 second of full throughput on a 64Mbit/s connection. 

So you're getting 7.5 seconds of latency if you do 5 hops, which isn't a lot.

Now start re-evaluating some of these assumptions and you'll see that the propagation time is not at all negligible, like you were claiming.

It's not network breaking, but it's a noticeable advantage and incentive for  miners to locate themselves in the same region, leading to centralization.

Well, if a service can transparently replenish a crypto balance when you spend it, that's all there is to it.  You can separate that into two services, one which spends and notifies the other service, which decides whether or not to take the cue from your fiat account.

You've been conflating full nodes and miners through this whole thread.  Miners have technologies like FIBRE (and some thin block technology IIRC) for rapid block propagation which minimizes block propagation latency, and they also tend to have significantly higher connections (can't give you a stat but it's pretty obvious anyone investing > $10,000/mo in mining isn't going to skimp on an internet connection and risk mining invalid blocks).  OP's post wasn't even about miners in the first place, full node latency is a totally different issue.;2;0;False;djvs9999;drl3lvw;54% of reachable Bcash full nodes are running on virtual servers of Alibaba in China, against only 2% of Bitcoin, hmmmm;7l1kss;https://twitter.com/lopp/status/943479553829343232

"I've set up a node more times than I can remember, admittedly I didn't sit there each time dividing the time to complete over the block height.   But I'll do that right now.  We're at height 500,000, and it takes on average about 3 days to sync a node right now, right?  A bit lower now I think, even.  So that's 259200 seconds, or 2 blocks (2mb) per second.   Those UTXO lookups are stored in memory IIRC, or at least btree or similar on the filesystem, so not very expensive.  Really doesn't change my point much.

Yes, well that is a chunk of the reason there's low bandwidth between the U.S. and China, the other big reason being China's crummy ISPs.   This kind of gets into the sharding conversation, but I'll leave it there.

A store of value is the function of an asset that can be saved, retrieved and exchanged at a later time, and be predictably useful when retrieved. More generally, a store of value is anything that retains purchasing power into the future.

If you're here I'm assuming you believe bitcoin is worth something and will be worth even more in the future, this would constitute a good store of value (depending on who you ask, some say bitcoin will go to zero in the near future, don't listen to them) 

Money, on the other hand, is consistently being printed by the US government and therefore losing its value over time. Fiat currency is widely considered to be a poor store of value these days due to the rate of inflation. Cash is, on the other hand, a better store of value than let's say a 2010 Ford Focus for example.

">Just sha256'ed a 13mb file (CPU). 0.08s, so 0.16s for a double.

That's great, now how about you setup a node and see how long it actually takes to verify a 1MB block. Spoiler: it's not the same as a single round of Sha256 on a blob of serial data. It actually involves a bunch of table lookups to verify output validity, as well as checking the criptographic signatures, which are not just one round of Sha256.

Maybe I don't understand what you're trying to say here.  It sounds like you're implying that the LN doesn't really reduce the number of transactions necessary to go on to the blockchain.  That once channels are used to send coins through if one party wants to close a channel all subsequent channels must close for the coins to move. This is incorrect.  It's not recursive. As coins are passed through the network each channel remains independent of the other channels.  In other words the lightening network is using tail recursion.

">Bitcoin is meant to be a global digital asset, a currency accessible to all. You can't maintain that title with a system which accomplishes its scaling via raising the minimum requirements to participate on the network. Especially when most people in the world do not have any choice over their network connection.

Doesnt this fall apart when the fee is as high as it is? If you use the money spent on fees and put them towards hosting full nodes while increasing the blocksize to 8mb you'd still probably have more than 1000 times the current nodes even if every block is full.

Lets say such a node costs $1 per hour to run (600+ per month), youd be able to run 700k nodes (120k$ avg fees per block * 6 per hr = 720k)

You would have a more accessible coin. Right now doing one transaction costs more than having a full node for a month. As a currency, bitcoin is (atm) a big failure in anything that is not a big international settlement.

"Listen, I know the role of nodes. I literally run one. Google how to set up a full node on Debian and you'll find scripts that I personally wrote. I've been around Bitcoin since 2012.

Larger blocks do not make running full nodes inaccessible to the general public.  I'm repeating myself here, but ah well: segwit and BCH require almost the same disk space for a full node. About 63 GB / year for both. (1.8 MB / block vs 2 MB / block)


Secondly, we don't need a million full nodes.  Propagation throughout the network requires a lot fewer nodes than you think.  If you want my opinion on the real ""danger"" of centralization, then it's that ASICs became a thing, making local miners much less practical.

It's the main narrative against BCH, that big blocks will lead to centralization.  By suggesting such has already taken place, even dishonestly, it lends credence to the narrative (as most won't fact-check).  Almost as bad as BCH supporters spreading misinformation about the potential issues with Lightning Network, except in their case it's usually just genuine misunderstanding.  Lopp is too smart for this to have been an honest mistake, which is unfortunate.  He's usually more level-headed than that.;2;0;False;;drk12hy;54% of reachable Bcash full nodes are running on virtual servers of Alibaba in China, against only 2% of Bitcoin, hmmmm;7l1kss;https://twitter.com/lopp/status/943479553829343232
Funny that you say that, considering Bitcoin has a lot more transactions than Bcash even though Bcash has larger blocks. Also, according to your narrative, Ethereum is actually Bitcoin.;2;1;False;HelloImRich;drjtujp;54% of reachable Bcash full nodes are running on virtual servers of Alibaba in China, against only 2% of Bitcoin, hmmmm;7l1kss;https://twitter.com/lopp/status/943479553829343232

"When two people get married, they can live in a tiny apartment.  When they have their first kid, they get a bigger place - their first house.  When the second kid comes and the mother-in-law shows up, they get an even bigger house.

The solution is to increase square footage, not make people smaller.  More people means more square footage is needed.  The problem is the balance.  If our couple decides to have 10 kids, it doesn't automatically mean they need to start remodeling an airplane hangar or an abandoned textile mill.  They just need to find some balance and get a 3,100 square foot house in an affordable part of town.

The right scaling solution probably combines both the block increase and the off-chain transactions.";6;0;False;floofcikins;drk0q15;54% of reachable Bcash full nodes are running on virtual servers of Alibaba in China, against only 2% of Bitcoin, hmmmm;7l1kss;https://twitter.com/lopp/status/943479553829343232

"I have pulled the latest nodes and done my own count.  Bitcoin ABC Total nodes: 1237.  Bitcoin ABC Hosted Alibaba Nodes: 543.  So I get 43%.  If you would like me to share my data I can give it to you.  It comes from the source linked by void-wanderer.  He might have counted other ones that I'm not familiar with but the obvious ones were Hangzhou Alibaba Advertising Co. and Alibaba (China) Technology Co.

I used to think that it was this sub that's censored but the longer I've been looking into both (for news), this sub feels way WAY more organic and real.
