I'm with you. But real quick can you clue me in on how interest rates going up causes property values to inflate? I can sort of see it but am thinking along the lines of prices move to meet demands.

"So the reason money is worth something is because people trust it is worth something, that's it. The actual cost to make money is less than a penny each note.

So why would people trust that Bitcoin is worth something? Well it offers some good alternatives to fiat. 

When you said the guy wanted millions not bitcoin, you mean he wanted things that he could buy with those millions. But if Bitcoin is exchangable for products and services like fiat than having one or the other makes no difference except that with Bitcoin, it's potentially quick, easier, faster, cheaper (hopefully after some forks), and especially for big money transfers over seas they won't charge you 10 percent of 100000 dollars which is a big chunk.

"You guys need to learn a better way of telling inside jokes. Apples aren't finite is a long stretch from there being excess supply... There can be an excess supply of something that is finite... the best inside jokes don't require telepathy. 

You're also a little bit behind the times. They did print money back when we were having world wars but these days the government borrows money and pays interest 4 budgets like military.

While printing money does have an impact on inflation, it happens a lot less than you would expect. Other factors such as interest rates, minimum wage, and Market fluctuations in supply and demand affect inflation. Inflation is calculated based on a common basket of goods which your typical individual or family would purchase as wants or needs.

While there is a finite supply of Bitcoin and similar currencies, it is not exempt from the forces of the economy with which it deals. As soon as enough people start wanting to cash out of the growing value and it hits a turning point, the value will drop. When things, even currencies, so fast, people who are looking at purchasing them start paying less and less. Also one cryptocurrency might have a finite Supply, but when you have other cryptocurrencies popping up now and becoming popular... Overall cryptocurrencies can be seen as having the same problem as regular currencies. At least in terms of their being a finite Supply, when new cryptocurrencies are being created before all the finite supply of the current ones have even been mined yet";1;0;False;bravenone;dmzwi1e;Governments/Banks vs Bitcoin.;7000xh;https://i.redd.it/1ui0rr23hplz.jpg

But Gabe doesn't even let you buy games from him using TF2 items does he? He only takes money. i.e he's not stupid, but he trusts that gamers are (and he's right to trust in that)

Jeez. So you'll be happy if the $4000 you paid for a bitcoin the other day is only worth a penny when you take it out the ""storage""?

Wake up. Part of the reason people invest at all is because even money loses value if it's just stored (especially these days with practically no interest - a few decades ago with 6 figures in the bank you could live of the interest if you were at the stage where you had no mortgage or rent, but no chance today, so people look to invest, but they are investing in cryptocoins to make money)";1;1;False;;dmzknyc;Governments/Banks vs Bitcoin.;7000xh;https://i.redd.it/1ui0rr23hplz.jpg

bitcoin is more like gold. A potentially stupid thing with few uses but very limited supply. And so long as everyone agrees it is worth something it remains worth something.

"Visa also processes upwards of 60 billion transactions per year. How much electricity does it take to process and validate one Bitcoin transaction? Bitcoin currently uses about the same amount of power as Jordan does in an entire year to validate orders of magnitude fewer transactions than visa. It takes 6x's the power of an average US household to verify a transaction. Bitcoin cannot scale to the size of Visa.  No crypto currency can. 

Japan has been swinging between -.4% and about 1% and its central bank loosens money every time it comes back, because lending doesn't work in long periods of deflation because real rates of interest are much higher. Banks only lend during periods of deflation, due to proding by central banks and adoption of negative interest rates.

With Bitcoin there is 0 incentive to adopt a negative interest rate. Ever. Your money will always be worth more in your pocket then it will be lending it especially given its currents bullish run.

"> shares of a company

That's shares of ownership, ICOs are not IPOs.

**IPO:** the investor is entitled upon subscription, to a claim in the entities assets minus its liabilities (known as equity) and has a right to vote on matters relating to the company.

**ICO:** The investor will have a claim to the usage of that token but have no equity in the underlying corporate entity nor voting power. 

**The ICO Exception Case:** The exception is ICOs which offer profit sharing agreements, or voting agreements, which can bring them under regulatory purvue in that it blurs the distinction between the an IPO and a revenue generating product or service token.

"As opposed to Bitfinex disappearing with scads of cash? At least the financial system has chargeback for fraud. The crypto world equivalent has no chargeback and regularly engages in stealing from their customers and disappearing, chants of ""caveat emptor"" trailing behind them. 

Bankers love the stuff - the currency trading charts don't look like flatlines before January of this year compared to after for no reason. Regulators and big data enthusiasts love the technology - there's talk of the Census Bureau making their historically adept secrecy even better by securing interview information from field reps with it, and other departments and bureaus that require a high degree of verifiability of information, like the BLM. There really is only acrimony over just how accepting the community has been of fraud, racketeering, theft, money laundering, tax evasion, and all manner of antisocial, societally damaging behavior and the doublethink of apologising for and enabling this behavior on the one hand and in having evangelical faith while simultaneously settling into a state of paranoia and military-hardened security and distrust of ""normies"" over it on the other.

This isn't a ""banker's panic"" - the only ones panicking are the lice preying on people, the snake oil salesmen, the Eastern European money launderers all fleeing as this technology finally crosses the border from Cryptolandia into the real world. The Howey Test is easy to pass, and the definition of business partners and accredited investors insofar as doing business with the average man with some bits and bucks in his pocket, has always been a low and easy bar to clear in the USA. Securities like LAToken are revolutionary, and my state's annual community credit union conference had a breakout session looking at how to use this setup to make their collective stock of illiquid assets more fungible, but the resultant need for investor protections and identification and verification, of the traditional need for escrow accounts to be FDIC ensured, while if implemented would bring in a tidal wave of investment, is seen as anathema. 

The USG and Japanese governments are rapidly moving sensitive material over to immutable distributed tokenless ledgers, the old ""ripoff"" financial sector is completely changing their backend and in the process massively reducing the capability of fraud, both within the banks and from external actors. The governments of the world, the central banks, and the international financial system, for their numerous faults, will be more healthy for the widespread acceptance and utilization of blockchain technology. 

What is crumbling is the idea that everyone so quietly and secretly hates all governance and authority that the blockchain protocol and distributed currency will just inherently wipe out all centralized authority, or that the technology itself will just naturally destroy all centralization. It's just a tool, and will be used in any manner it can be, as all tools are. What is also crumbling is the paranoid schizophrenic attitude that sees all government as inherently and monolithically evil, incapable, and the antithesis of collective contribution, and the Bitcoin community and its puritanical take on Objectivism, avoidance of non-transactional relationships, intentional blindness to a near-ubiquitous state of FUD, lies, scams, hacks, and organized crime, and disdain for normies and the ""weak"" caught up in them, and universal trustlessness, as inherently pure and good, and the view from that paranoid perspective that this is all the Man fighting back and losing. Then again, this is the community whose conference is hosted by a man who cannot re-enter several US states because of arrest warrants for defrauding people in foreclosure, investors, and the elderly - and a community with members that are not reprimanded for blaming these fraud victims and celebrating his ability to fleece them. 

TL;DR Everyone loves the stuff and can't incorporate it fast enough and the traditional systems are being made healthier for it, the only people panicking are thieves and price manipulators.

"Definition: Quantitative easing is a massive expansion of the open market operations of a central bank. It’s used to stimulate the economy by making it easier for businesses to borrow money. The bank buys securities from its member banks to add liquidity to capital markets. This has the same effect as increasing the money supply. In return, it the central bank issues credit to the banks' reserves to buy the securities.


Where do central banks get the credit to purchase these assets? They simply create it out of thin air. Only central banks have this unique power. This is what people are referring to when they talk about the Federal Reserve “printing money.”

I'm not OP, but I will admit that as a computer scientist, my knowledge of finance comes from a variety of sources online, and that my understanding might even be wrong. How about telling us exactly **how** OP was wrong, instead of berating him as ""uneducated""?

Didn't the government literally create currency out of thin air during QE? Sure they didn't engage the printing press, but manipulated some ledger entries to add extra zeros at the end. As for ""unwinding"", shouldn't we wait until the Fed actually *succeeds* before we declare the grand Quantitative-Easing/Quantitative-Tightening experiment to be a success?

> The USD is backed by the US's incentive to remain solvent and they night have a few ways of achieving this. They're called aircraft carriers.

The US is 20 trillion dollars in debt, and 70% of this is debt held by it's people. Surely they aren't going to bomb us with these shiny aircraft carriers when the bill comes due? No. More likely they will borrow again, and if that doesn't happen they will devalue the currency by *more* printing, and give us our FULL amounts owed. Which will have no purchasing power left due to devaluation.

China has about 8-10% of the debt I believe. I highly doubt we are going to bomb China as well. That will be one hell of a rude awakening.

Stocks in the Us are propped up by tax breaks and inflationary currency, and the valuations of the companies have been growing to higher and higher multiples that wouldn't seem rational to an analyst from 20 years ago, but the fact that someone will come along and pay more for it keeps the merry-go-round turning.

"**Renaissance**

The Renaissance (UK: , US: ) was a period in European history, from the 14th to the 17th century, regarded as the cultural bridge between the Middle Ages and modern history. It started as a cultural movement in Italy in the Late Medieval period and later spread to the rest of Europe, marking the beginning of the Early Modern Age.

The intellectual basis of the Renaissance was its own invented version of humanism, derived from the rediscovery of classical Greek philosophy, such as that of Protagoras, who said that ""Man is the measure of all things."" This new thinking became manifest in art, architecture, politics, science and literature. Early examples were the development of perspective in oil painting and the recycled knowledge of how to make concrete.

I'll tell you what, I'll bet you 1 BitCoin that 10 years from now BitCoin and Blockchain will have transformed investment banking.

"Um what? Why would it ever reach a critical mass if it was even possible to ""do something about it""?

The entire value of the concept is that **nobody can do anything about it**, and we can throw your comment in the trash can with the rest of the loophole-riddled hypotheticals.

But your plea for ""customer service"" ... I have to say, you're the first person I've ever found who will **miss** customer service from financial institutions in the slightest...

Blockchain is the **ultimate** customer service. That is one huge part of the concept.

I think you have a fundamental misunderstanding of the concepts (not the current market landscape, on which you are clearly knowledgeable) of blockchain and how it can represent a fundamental shift in currency and transactions like you read about in AP Human Geography.

Not gonna happen overnight. People were not excited about putting their credit cards on the internet in 1998 because it added another abstraction layer of technology that nobody understood at the time. There were speedbumps. All of them were corporate-related, hacking-related, fraud-related... Blockchain is the next step in all of these areas. The technology is preventing itself from becoming a bubble. But it's important to understand that **that is part and parcel with the concept** and how it is value-driven unlike fiat.

 I can preach all day but I really, really, for your own good, think you should really hammer down your thoughts on the concepts...

"Doing something about it doesn't necessarily mean trying to arrest people or shut down servers. Doing something about it could be creating a state backed crypto currency that easily ties into the existing banking system with proper customer service and accountability.

Ie. provide a smooth transition into the next state of currency just like much of the West once made a smooth transition from physical money first to plastic bank cards first.

Doing something about it could mean spending effort to track and find Bitcoin holders before taxing and fining them for unreported wealth. My nation holds a big effort every few years to track down people's unreported savings and it's quite effective. Numerous people hand themselves over just to get a lower fine for tax dodging all those years.

All you need to 'do something about bitcoin' is provide a more acceptable alternative and bitcoin's mainstream reason for being disappears.

Blockchain is not the ultimate customer service. Block chain does not pick up the phone and answer questions or provide assistance. Blockchain is the technology many institutions are looking into adapting for their own use while ignoring bitcoin. Hell, I have a meeting about looking into the potential of block chain tech for our organisation next week.

Anyway my original point was that I see a big future for mass acceptance of crypto. I just don't see bitcoin being that mass accepted cryptocurrency. It's lacking almost all of the key qualities.

">  just that between the two there is less underlying substance in the stock market.

You're joking right? Please tell me you're joking.

>Stocks in the Us are propped up by tax breaks and inflationary currency

What tax breaks exactly? CGT discounting is accepted worldwide as a fair norm, and dividends are taxed twice in the US. All currencies are designed to be inflationary, that's when the economy works best.

> the valuations of the companies have been growing to higher and higher multiples that wouldn't seem rational to an analyst from 20 years ago, but the fact that someone will come along and pay more for it keeps the merry-go-round turning

That's not a terrible argument. However, due to extreme low interest rates and a very strong performance by US multinationals over the past few years it can be argued that forward PE multiples are actually not unreasonable.

>If I just want to save money and not worry about inflation, I can buy Bitcoin and call it a day.

Why not stocks? Why not real estate? Why not money markets? All of these are backed by real underlying assets and people invest in them to avoid an inflationary currency.

You can look at the JPM earnings presentation and decide for yourself what portions you want to call consumer, traditional business/corporate, and then investment banking.

"Of all the shows I cited, only Ben 10 could be considered a kids show (Simpsons, Family Guy, Southpark are very much aimed at adults).  I could have also mentioned Hollywood movies like ""Blow"" and ""Deadpool"" both of which featured bitcoin, and the entire (definitely *not* for kids) second series of Mr. Robot which I hear was basically just one long bitcoin advert.

Does this embedding of imagery and ideas in movies and kids shows have an effect?  Sure, you only need ask why McDonald's and others have such huge marketing budgets for sneaky product placements in kids shows to see how their dark magic is performed.

Away from that darker side: tackling social issues through kids cartoons and movies is vitally important to their future development into adulthood and in nurturing the right kind of ideas we have agreed as a group we want them to learn about; Gay Rights issues, for instance, were subtly tackled and talked about in kids shows in the 80's (Rainbow being a good example in the UK) in order to prepare the younger populace for a radically shifting societal mindset, away from commonly held discriminatory viewpoints that may have been held by their parents.  Subtly introducing them to bitcoin opens up the exact same 'curiosity pathways' in their young minds and helps them question commonly held assumptions about 'the way the world works'.

As we know from [the Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance) and Enlightenment periods that came before, it is always artists that carry the message of transformation to the masses; be that through the printing press, the paintbrush, or today's modern equivalents of the street artist murals, TV screens, memes and youtube virals.  

TL;DR: **Yes, bitcoin sewing its way into the consciousness of popular culture via trusted and loved TV shows and artists works is incredibly important in crossing the chasm of awareness.**  Especially as none of those messages have been paid for, but are there as testament to the creators and writers belief in the technology as a force of good.

Indeed, even though I had known about and been involved in bitcoin since the first month of its release, it was only after watching the bitcoin music video [Cyprus Anthem by Zhou Tonged](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6Hp_Zq3rU) that I finally realised bitcoin was *the* solution to many of the problems myself and others working in the light had been so focused on fixing since the financial crisis began.

"When I say ""substance"" I mean ""what you see is what you get.""  It's not hard to understand the basics of crypto, but it is difficult to cull accurate and relevant info about a stock.  And once you've paid for access to said info, there's still a subjective decision to be made.  We can certainly agree that the stock market in theory has underlying substance.  

Long term capital gains rates attract vast amounts of capital to the stock market, and are obviously not relegated only to that asset class, but with other sectors still recovering from demonstrable bubbles stocks are likely attracting a disproportionate amount of capital.  If I want to put my cash into gold or silver (physical, not paper), or collectibles I get nicked an additional 10%.  I view this as a penalty tax for not playing the game the way I'm supposed to.

Personally I do invest in real estate, but that, along with your other suggestions, is an investment.  There are a huge number of people who don't have the time or sophistication to participate in those markets and they're all penalized for it.  I don't see crypto supplanting fiat, but I do see it as a parralel option that can compete to some extent with fiat, and bring a small bit of accountability to those pulling the strings.

I may be jumping a few steps ahead in my view of Bitcoin, but I see the potential and knowingly choose to treat it as what it is designed to be instead of what it is today.  We're in a phase of adoption that requires this of some ""believers,"" and it also is being helped along by speculators as you seem to be.  

I don't think I push any particular premise about Bitcoin.  I moved outside the states and I find it to be very useful in moving money cheaply across borders; as a merchant I think the idea of being able to potentially save 3% on CC processing fees is awesome; as a libertarian I love the idea of a permissionless currency; and as a critic of the legacy financial system I think it would be great if there was an asset that let people opt out of inflationary fiat.  I vote with my dollars and I hope that it turns out to mean something better for my kids.  I would never advocate someone *invest* in crypto if they didn't share my ideals.
