"**Bitcoin: Units**

The unit of account of the bitcoin system is bitcoin. As of 2014, symbols used to represent bitcoin are BTC, XBT, and ₿ (U+20BF, ). Small amounts of bitcoin used as alternative units are millibitcoin (mBTC), microbitcoin (µBTC, sometimes referred to as bit), and satoshi. Named in homage to bitcoin's creator, a satoshi is the smallest amount within bitcoin representing 0.

A debate exists within the United States government, and American society at large, over whether the one-cent coin, commonly called the penny, should be eliminated as a unit of currency in the United States. Two bills introduced in the US Congress would have ceased production of pennies, but neither bill was approved. Such a bill would leave the nickel, at five cents, as the lowest-value coin. On February 15, 2013, President Barack Obama stated his willingness to eliminate the penny.

Because it would be many people?  Who cares, it's not like they get any more voting power.

"> They say, I would rather get into something new.

Pretty much. The Bitcoin Train left a while ago. $30 worth of BTC would have turned into a tidy sum if you bought when the train was leaving. Now? It would appear that the value has mostly leveled off, and the chance for large gains has passed. People who weren't on the train are now scanning the horizon for the sort of opportunity that BTC represented, the kind that turns $30 into $300 or more. 

Likewise, mining was, for just a minute, something you could throw your gaming computer at and make enough BTC with your hardware to even put yourself through college, provided you held on. Again, that opportunity is gone. Even Ethereum seems past its opportunity date as values soar.

That leaves BTC as a strange cryptocurrency that people still don't understand, one whose investment value is akin to regular stocks and other vehicles. It's not a money printing machine anymore, and people need money printing machines. BTC itself is a hassle to get, convert, and spend, much as stocks are, and the risk is on the holder. You may as well buy stocks. BTC is still only at it's most useful moving money around behind the governments back, except even that statement is probably not true, I'm sure governments are well aware. So now even that advantage is suspect. 

I'm afraid Bitcoin is the victim of its own success as far as generating new interest goes.

"I kinda know those feels.

I started with Bitcoin very early; I remember the first peak at ~$20. Unfortunately I wasn't very financially stable during that time and as a result I wasn't able to keep my coins. I had to sell them to pay basic expenses, multiple times. I've profited from Bitcoin enough to buy my wife a new car ($30k, ± $5k), but not enough to be really life-changing.

I once lost >200 BTC to someone who managed to log in to my MtGox account. It shared a username/password with one from a data breach, and they just transferred out what I had left in the exchange. At the time that was only worth a couple hundred bucks and I had thousands of BTC left in my cold wallets, to I didn't even investigate it - just closed the account and opened another.

My point in this is to say that I've been around a long time. I've written libraries in multiple languages to interact with the Satoshi client and to parse the blockchain. I know the fundamentals of Bitcoin inside and out.

That said, I've stopped paying attention to the day-to-day drama in the Bitcoin world. I now have only a vague awareness of the upcoming decision point in August, and can explain UASF and SegWit only in very broad terms. I don't have the time nowadays to work on Bitcoin as a side project, and I don't get a shit about what's going on right now. While I'm prepared to lose every satoshi of value in my cold wallets, I'm still convinced that there are only two places the price of Bitcoin can end up - ""to the moon"", at many thousands of USD per coin, or $0. This August may trigger a bubble or it may trigger a massive sell-off, but it doesn't matter to me because I don't plan to ever sell my coins off for USD. Instead, I'll use them directly when I retire or pass them down to my children.

I think there are a lot more people like the out there - ""old guard"" holders - than people think. I know I have wallets that haven't moved since late 2010 or so that are still as secure, anonymous, and liquid as they were the day I created them. I doubt seriously that all of us are keeping up with the day-to-day drama.

So they say. So it appears based on a third-party review of the code that they got when they hit the site.

The only thing stopping Blockchain from sending themselves your key and stealing your coins is their word that they won't, and your hope that someone else doesn't find a code injection on their site.

Browser-based wallets are poison - building crypto/security libraries on top of JavaScript is like building a mansion on a foundation of sand.

For the average user, a smartphone-based wallet is the best security they'll find for a hot wallet. The OS itself is responsible for sandboxing running apps, and the platform has been a target for a long time.

"> If I understand correctly, neither Bitcoin can be infinitely divisible.

Correct, mostly.

Bitcoin is in theory infinitely divisible, but in current application there are two floors: the minimum transaction size and the unit.

Due to the way in which computers store numbers, only whole numbers are suitable for use in financial transactions. The Bitcoin protocol specifies that 1 BTC is represented internally as 1x10^8 units. As a result, 0.00000001 BTC (1 satoshi) is the smallest value that can be represented right now. There's nothing preventing the network in the future from deciding that from block *n* forward, each satoshi is worth 10^8 ""nakamotos"" or something - at which point the smallest representable unit would be 10^-16 BTC, as opposed to the 10^-8 BTC satoshi of today. This would require a hard fork, like most protocol changes (unless, of course, a more formal and flexible system of protocol change is implemented prior to this occurring).

The minimum transaction was introduced in 2013, and to my knowledge hasn't changed. The purpose was to patch a problem with ""spam"" transactions of tiny amounts of value designed to artificially inflate block size and therefore transaction costs. The transactions were known as ""dust"" at the time. The minimum transaction was 5430 satoshis (0.0000543 BTC) at the time of implementation. I don't think this has been repealed or modified, but I've not really kept up on it. It may be important to note that this was a change to the Satoshi client, *not* the protocol itself - the miners themselves get to decide whether or not to include a transaction into a block, so it's still theoretically possible to send a single satoshi if you mine the block yourself or convince the entity that does to include the transaction for you. However, in practice, the smallest transaction that will be confirmed has been 5430 satoshis since Gavin made the change.";2;1;False;PepeWarCry;dj7blk1;Spurring a lot of conversations with this one...;6igopz;https://i.redd.it/byr5ioixyu4z.jpg

"Don't feel bad about questions man; we're all learning and cryptocurrencies are a new and often confusing field. There are some good links on the sidebar to read through, but for buying I think the easiest way to get started would be [LocalBitcoins](https://localbitcoins.com/). It's a site where people make listings for buying/selling coins. Choose an offer with your preferred payment method from someone with a good rating, follow the instructions, and you'll be on your way.

If you'd rather go with a regulated and insured company, [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) and [Gemini](https://gemini.com/) are some of the more well-known and reputable exchanges and are pretty simple to use. You will have to go through a longer process of identity and bank verification though.

For storing coins long term, you'll want something secure and foolproof like a hardware wallet. [Ledger](https://www.ledgerwallet.com/products/ledger-nano-s) and [Trezor](https://trezor.io/) are the most often recommended ones.

There are also dedicated 'beginner' subreddits for cryptos like /r/BitcoinBeginners and /r/ethereumnoobies. I recommend learning a bit about Ethereum, not as a 'competitor' to Bitcoin, but as a complementary blockchain with interesting features/use cases of its own and a strong development and user community.";1;0;False;Mortos3;dj6q7uw;Spurring a lot of conversations with this one...;6igopz;https://i.redd.it/byr5ioixyu4z.jpg
Find a reputable exchange, then withdraw to a hardware (or paper) wallet. Do your homework on that process first. Lots of info out there. Coinbase is probably the easiest way to purchase.;1;0;False;cryptoasty;dj6oeph;Spurring a lot of conversations with this one...;6igopz;https://i.redd.it/byr5ioixyu4z.jpg
"You will need A. Some US dollars in a bank (well, any currency but I'll explain with USD), B. what's called a bitcoin ""wallet"" and C. a visit to a bitcoin exchange (sort of like a stock exchange):

Step 1. Go here and set up your bitcoin wallet: https://blockchain.info

Read the instructions for how to do an online wallet. A wallet is exactly what it sounds like: it's a way to interact with your bitcoin (it's a bit more complicated than that but that's the basic idea). You'll not only have a login an password with them but you'll also have two other things, a bitcoin address and a your personal passkey, both of which kind of look something like this (a long stream of seemingly random numbers and letters.

0dhkgu8ekd783sha13dajrix90x

Your bitcoin address is fine to give out but your passkey should be kept very safe. Read online articles about how to keep your passkey safe.

Step 2. Go to the Coinbase.com cryptocurrency exchange setup an account with a login and password and link your bank account, credit card, or PayPal account with them. You'll be asked to verify your identity through various methods depending on if you use a bank transfer, credit card, or PayPal.

Step 3. Once verified at Coinbase, deposit some US dollars into the account and use that to purchase bitcoin.

In Coinbase, once you've purchased bitcoin it'll add the bitcoins to a wallet that Coinbase makes for you. It's EXTREMELY UNWISE to leave your bitcoins on Coinbase, which is where step 1 comes back into play.

Step 4. Use the blockchain.jnfo bitcoin address you set up in step 1 and plug that into Coinbase to transfer your bitcoins to your personal wallet. Again, DO NOT LEAVE YOUR BITCOIN ON COINBASE; only use it for buying and selling.

And that's about it. You've now got bitcoin in your personal wallet.

Some more notes:

- Read a book on bitcoin to see what's really going on with your coins.

- Again, never leave your coins on an exchange like Coinbase. You might have heard of MtGox, which was an exchange that went down and lost like half a billion dollars worth of user's bitcoins in 2014 or 2015.

- ALWAYS do test transfers of small amounts of money or bitcoin first as a test. Buy only the minimum bitcoin as a trial (I think it's something like $25 worth ... I don't remember the exact amount) and then make sure the transfer to your personal wallet goes through.

- You are basically your own bank! The more security you have the better.";6;1;False;DreadnaughtHamster;dj6o9ql;Spurring a lot of conversations with this one...;6igopz;https://i.redd.it/byr5ioixyu4z.jpg

In order for people to start adopting bitcoin in it's current state they would have to understand far *far* more complex concepts involving security, privacy and the nature of money, fungibility, reversibility etc. If understanding the sentence ""it is divisible to 8 decimals bro"" takes 1 second, explaining ""cold storage"" is going take hours.

~~Yes!~~ Kinda.  A  ""bitcoin"" is [divisible into 100 million subunits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin#Units) called ""satoshis"".  Satoshis are the actual underlying units used in transactions. One satoshi is `0.00000001` bitcoin.
