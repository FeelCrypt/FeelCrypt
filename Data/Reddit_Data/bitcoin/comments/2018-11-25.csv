"So you agree with me. Network effect and consensus are the only thing that make Bitcoin different than other coins. That's exactly what your two links say.

It has no value. The onlyt thing giving it a value is the fact that some people want it. Which means it has a price, not intrinsic value. The consensus can disappear, so can disappear the network effect.

When something has intrinsic value, it has intrinsic value regardless of what other people think about it. A rocket has intrinsic value as it brings you into space, regardless of what people want to pay for it.

"No, I don't agree with you and that's not the conclusion I'd make from those 2 links i gave you. I suggest you re-read the 2nd article, from the part titled ""Bitcoin’s use value"" on.

&#x200B;

*Intrinsic value* is mainly a philosophical question and it's highly doubtful such a thing exists at all, nor is there consensus has when a thing has value “in itself,” or “for its own sake,” or “as such,” or “in its own right.”. Your example with the rocket shows that intrinsic value is highly subjective and subject to consensus as well. A rocket can take you to space, yes. But that doesn't mean much if no one is interested in going to space or transporting something there. Would a rocket have ""intrinsic value"" in the stone age? Probably not, because a  caveman would have no idea what to do with it... This brings us to usefulness - we usually assign ""intrinsic value"" to an object, an asset, a thing, that has a use. And that what the article on fee. org article refers to, the use case of bitcoin.

I'd like to recommend another article, which I find pictures the essence of Bitcoin much better than any of those *Bitcoin is a new type of currency, a virtual currency* ""explanations"".

"> Bitcoin’s use value

Again, not different than any fork or many other technologically better coins.

Only consensus makes it different.

You just can't win that argument with me, plus I was writing about all of these stuff and writing articles for a long time. 

Currencies have no intrinsic value, end of story.

Money is not wealth, it's a medium to acquire it. Bitcoin has zero value, same as the US dollar.

You're free to believe it's different, but for every immutable, etc, bullshit you'll throw at me I'll simply tell you ""okay, so I create a fork and I have another coin with the same properties"" and the only thing that you'll have left will be ""yeah, but nobody cares about your coin"" thus confirming in an endless loop that consensus and network effect are what gives Bitcoin a price.

But it has no use, no value. A rocket does, a cow does, a bottle has value, everything I can use has a value, Bitcoin requires some other person to give it a value so it has one.

It's only the consensus giving them any value.

The other famous statement of his is how Bitcoin is ""probably rat poison squared"", backing his pal Munger. The latter statement isn't really a coherent argument (it's more like a mindless rant, something you'd hear behind the bar in a pub or something), so he can't be correct/right with that statement. 

Regarding Bitcoin as an investment: I actually agree that buying bitcoin shouldn't be seen as a (classic) investment. It's not - you are actually buying an object that isn't an asset that is used to produce anything. That doesn't mean that this object is useless - it is, because of its properties - it can be transfered over large distances (the whole internet)  with ease, is unforgeable, supply can't be inflated, etc. In this extent it shares some characteristics with gold - namely those that make gold suitable as money, i.e. store of value, medium of exchange and unit of account  (and use of gold as money is the main real case use since ancient time). Since bitcoin is useful because of these properties means it has some value. How much worth it is because it has value, is up for the global society to agree. We're still very early in the process of making such an agreement / in the process of price finding. I haven't a clue on how much we'll all eventually agree bitcoin is worth, but I believe we're still very early on, the adoption and usage is still low, which is why i expect the price will be set higher than it currently is (and in fact higher than the last ATH).

"There's no downside to using a middleman to transfer funds. That's why it's been down that way forever. And I can PayPal money to Cuba right now lol. You are trying to invent a value proposition where there is none. 

Bitcoins price is not ""earned"" by anything other than what someone is willing to pay. And people are only willing to pay because they think it will be worth more USD in the future. That's a collectible

It's like the perfect scam object to use on millennials. Millennials grew up during the emergence of ""digital"" so they intrinsically believe anything digital is good and to be trusted. They also make less money than previous generations, are less educated about personal finances than earlier generations, and  carry massively more debt that previous generations. 

Pump and Dump scammers saw Bitcoin and were like ""Wait, a digital object that can appear to create value out of thin air without working for it that is totally unregulated? And an entire generation dying to make free money cause  they make less and owe more? And they haven't been taught how to identify scams masquerading as an ""investment""? There is a God!""

That's all Bitcoins value is. It's the equilibrium of what a FOMO sucker thinks is a good deal that will make him free money, and a scammer selling to that sucker. Nothing more

I truly believe Bitcoin will go down in history as the medium responsible for on of the largest acts of fraud the world has ever seen. Sociologists and Economists in academia will be studying this for ages. And entire asset invented out of thin air used exclusively to rip people off while playing them with a Jonestown-esque belief system keeping the wool over their eyes while they continue to be fleeced. It is a big area of emerging study I see coming that hopefully will be used to create checks and balances designed to protect future generations.

Does that mean you can't make money off it? Of course not plenty of collectibles make money. Most lose massive value. For every rare #1 book edition found at a garage sale or old Rembrandt found in the garage,  there are millions of people holding  onto worthless Garbage Pail kids and other failed collectibles. That's  why I never invest in the asset class, and honestly, even if I did, Bitcoin would be near the bottom of my list, but that's just me.
