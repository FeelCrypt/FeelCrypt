"True but you get the point. The truth is that many countries accept big numbers of immigrants and not many countries accept illegals. The US is almost 16 times the size of the UK but the UK has about 600,000 immigrants a year. Germany has about 5 - 600,000 a year.

Illegal southern border immigration is about 100,000 into the US according to this.

It is running right now. It said enter the passphrase for the wallet that will contain all the recovered keys.
