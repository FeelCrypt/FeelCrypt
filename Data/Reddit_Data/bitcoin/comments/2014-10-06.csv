"The formatting on my post was odd. I didn't mean for it to be one huge paragraph. Sorry if that makes it hard to read.

Unfortunately I didn't get a chance to ask him about specifics of how slow is slow. He basically made it sound like it's not practical.

If you read the article about the system that ""Anonymous"" developed (http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/05/01/anonymous_to_world_go_pirate_radio_for_datacomms/), one of the first things they say is:

""You're not going to get fast communications out of AirChat, since it takes the world back to the days of encoding data over voice channels. The group says “We traded bandwidth for freedom, or to be more exact we traded bandwidth for freedom, simplicity and low cost”.""

Then again just ten years ago the internet was painfully slow. Not sure if that helps, just figured since the question about using ham radio technology for this came up, I'd ask my dad. He loves talking about this stuff. As a computer science student, I find the implementation of it into systems of communication more interesting than the technology behind it. But one can't exist without the other, so I think I may have him help me tinker with this stuff over Thanksgiving and Christmas break. If it's not terribly expensive I'd like to set up an antenna at home and another where I go to college (~90 miles) and see what we can transfer.
