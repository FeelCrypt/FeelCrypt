"Yeah for sure, at least currently.  I think there might be a use case for micro transactions online as well via bitcoins lightning network.  Like right now the merchants just eat the credit card processing fee of $2.7 + 25 cents.  So if you had a small digital product you wanted to sell for less than $5-$10 it’s probably not worth it 

I’m not exactly sure if there are any products that fit in that category or if the masses would be willing to give up their awesome buyer protection where they can charge back for any reason and are almost completely protected from fraud.

I do however, think that adding micro transactions to digital platforms may be the best way to combat bots and brigading 

Like if it cost you some fraction of a penny to upvote or comment and it got less expensive the better your reputation was and more expensive the newer your account was and the amount of times you got flagged for trolling or being a racist asshole.  Then it would become much more expensive to socially engineer panic, hysteria, and violence.
