it says the key is encrypted with your password and is stored by both you and coinbase - if they are storing your encrypted key with your hashed password then they still hold your money and retain full control...if its **not** your password and it is indeed a 'pin' that you can control arbitrarily then that somewhat acts as a bandaid.  ;0;1;False;frankenmint;d1f60h2;Sold ~$5800 worth of BTC through Coinbase this week. $2490 has never been deposited.

They have no control over the 2nd key, and they cannot send/withdraw anything without you typing your password in.

> Coinbase does not have access to any bitcoin stored in the multisig vault. You can send your bitcoin without using Coinbase through our open-source recovery tool.

> You can backup your User and Shared keys on paper or on your computer. The Shared key is encrypted in your browser with your password. Coinbase never has access to your password or User key.
