"I thought it was a throw back to old days in England where they had ""baiting"" tournaments
Where they would put a dog or somesech against a bull or a bear ( like in GoT? When the tall blonde was ""baited) if times were good, they would use a bull (hence Bull market) if times were bad, they would use a bear because bulls were too valuable to waste and instead saved for breeding. (Hence, bear market). Side note, bull dogs were bred to gain control of bulls at the end of a fight. Their extended lower jaw and their boldness around loud And scary things allowed them to hook the bulls nose ring in their lower jaw and contain the bull.

"The terms came originally from [literally baiting a bear and bull to fight each other in the 1800s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear-baiting#North_America). Some accounts: 

> In a case of the bear winning, the bear would use its teeth to catch a bull between its horns, on its nose, which would allow the bear to move its head enough to twist its neck, or bite a part of the bull's body, like the tongue, or use its paws to catch or harm the bull, like in squeezing its neck, or catching its tongue.

> The bear used its sharp claws against the nose of the bull, before catching its tongue, after being repeatedly gored by the bull. Then the bull overturned it ""with a desperate effort,"" and then 'dispatched' it rather easily.

(This one is ""dubious""...)
> A bear called 'Samson' dug a hole so large that it could hold an elephant, before using its large paws to carry and throw an opposing bull headfirst into the hole, paw-swipe its side till its breath appeared to have been half-knocked out of its body, and then use one paw to hold the bull, and the other to bury it alive.
