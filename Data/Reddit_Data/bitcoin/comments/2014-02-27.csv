"If it were honest, the WSJ would be as it's name describes: a journal that reports the goings-on on Wall Street. Seems fairly simple to me. When did it become a propaganda tool?

Of course the OP is biased; but he's not the journalist! OP's *job* is to be biased about his topic. The journalists job (I thought) was to listen to OP's bias, filter through it, and come up with some kind of balanced reporting - both about the subject and about the person interviewed.

Why should anyone place any trust in a newspaper that permits or, God forbid, encourages this sort of mealy mouthed reporting? Is it's motto still ""The Truth in It's Proper Use""? Do those words carry any meaning anymore? From reading your comments, clearly things have devolved into ""journalists"" and / or their editors deciding what truth is and what it's proper use might be.

Which bring us back to propaganda, now doesn't it...

"""Where in the article did the journalist state that the OP was unhappy?""

Apparently the difference between 'making statements' and 'conveying the impression' eludes you.

Perhaps I can elucidate: you see, making a statement is something a person does by forming words inside their brain and vocalizing them. 'Conveying an impression' is something yellow journalists do by selectively using peoples statements and arranging their words in a certain way.

I would have thought this was covered in first year journalism.

"I still don't think you've managed to address the problem created by your lack of expertise in the thins that you are reporting on generally.

You may get a good explanation from an expert, but information is lost at each step, and is often simplified into something which is obviously wrong, or worse, something which is not obviously wrong.

I dunno about the rest, but I can say that almost any time I read anything in the press about anything I actually know about, the article is either wildly inaccurate, hopelessly simplistic, or misses the point entirely. For example, in tech, about the only reporters whose stuff I've read that have been reliably pretty accurate and insightful are Stephen Shankland and Steven Levy. There's hundreds of tech reporters, probably thousands if you include pundits, bloggers, and podcasters. That's not a high batting average.;2;0;False;Hixie;cfprqjw;Open Letter to Michael Casey - WSJ reporter who butchered my comments in today's Bitcoin cover story;1z010y;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1z010y/open_letter_to_michael_casey_wsj_reporter_who/

In terms of of having to be a generalist that covers different beats, often with short tenures, leads to one not being able to develop deep expertise in a field. And to that degree, you make a fair point. I apologize.

TOTALLY BLANKED OUT ON THIS ONE.  I actually interviewed Lyle Preslar, the guitarist for minor threat.  While this is slightly less cool than interviewing Ian, I was still really pumped about it. He was super cool.  Not at all what I expected lol.  I grew up listening to punk rock, and I know about the whole minor threat straight edge thing, so I was kinda expecting him to be wild and eccentric and the whole punk rock bit.  But he was surprisingly normal lol.  He lives in a nice house in a nice part of NJ, has a wife and a kid (possibly more now), and seemed very well put together and educated.  He went to law school and got his degree, and (if i remember correctly) was doing contract related law stuff lol.  I had a really great conversation with him.

"Specifically, Akamai helps websites that want to serve large amounts of static content (images, videos, unchanging text or html files, etc.).  

Imagine that I were running, say, ""mytube"". In the ordinary course of things, if you want to download a file from me, your browser will contact my server, and I'll have to push out the bits over my network connection to yours.   I'm going to get killed if I get successful.

Akamai helps me by hosting all that static content at various ""points of presence"" around the world, so that they are ""nearer"" to most consumers than my server (""nearer"" == less hops across the internet).  So if you ask me for a file, Akamai will help me determine that some other node ""x"" is nearer to you, so I will reply to your browser ""sure, get it from this path on ""x"""". So I'm only using a tiny part of my network bandwidth, and instead, I pay Akamai to bear that burden.

I'd guess that total bans are rarer than in the past. More likely there are limitations on use, obligations to allow personal computers and devices to log use and be searched on demand, and prohibitions on encryption or doing anything to defeat monitoring. The Internet is part of life and telling someone not to use it is similar to telling someone they have to stay sober.

The difference economists aren't asked to predict growth, market cap, or anything else in specificity.

That's what the article stated as well. Most economists agree that digital currencies would work **IF** there was some central authority that could regulate it, and create more bitcoins to flood the market when necessary to avoid huge boom and busts.

I don't claim to be as educated on this as a librarian, my point is that the libraries are still subject to laws. If a law was created stating libraries must maintain a list of banned members, they would do it. Would it be wholehearted? Possibly not. Would it be resisted? Likely. At the end of the day the law is the law and it gets implemented, regardless of the subjective views of those it affects, until it is changed or repealed.;1;0;False;vinnyveeg;cfq63wo;Open Letter to Michael Casey - WSJ reporter who butchered my comments in today's Bitcoin cover story;1z010y;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1z010y/open_letter_to_michael_casey_wsj_reporter_who/
No, I apologize for the confusion. From what I know, we did not have a list given to us, but a list made from violations done in the library.

"Agreed. I interpreted the meaning behind your first comment differently.

I'd also say that, while I'm not a fan of US taxation because of the whole indirectly-funding-murder thing (and just about everything else), I gladly pay my taxes in Japan, for example, because the worst thing they do with it, is perhaps be less efficient with it than a private company might be in some cases. Even that's a small amount compared to the wasted funds in the US. Just about everything we pay taxes for in the US, Japan does a hundredfold better. The rest of the things, the evil things, we don't pay for. No foreign wars, no corrupt murderers-with-badges, awesome healthcare, no homeless, no jobless. Come to think of it, maybe the worst use of taxes in Japan is if they use it to invest in US Dollar bonds, indirectly funding the machine too... but I think they stopped a while back when the dollar really started to suck.

That said, ignoring the ethical Kitty Genovese issue of paying taxes^1 in the US at all, tax evasion is not a victimless crime. The state is doing things with your money, and you are receiving things in return; things which you agree to by participating in the system. (Again, this is massive simplification, because there's no easy opt-out either.) 

If anything, tax evasion is a little bit like stealing cable TV service in an area where the cable company holds a complete monopoly. (And before Netflix etc.) There's not an immediately obvious victim, and the cable company is definitely kind of fucking you, *but* it's definitely not a 100% victimless crime.

^1 The question, then, is whether it is a worse crime to steal the US monopoly on services by receiving the good things without contributing taxes; or a worse crime to contribute to all the bad things by negligently allowing them to use your dollars to do things *we all know they do* in order to receive the forcibly-monopolistically-run benefits also. I'm not sure. I avoid the dilemma by paying Japanese taxes.";0;0;False;txmtx;cfpp23l;Open Letter to Michael Casey - WSJ reporter who butchered my comments in today's Bitcoin cover story;1z010y;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1z010y/open_letter_to_michael_casey_wsj_reporter_who/

I think that CNN just dumped him because of poor ratings, not because of being under investigation. But I don't know how these things work.

I think that one of his underlings through him/herself under the bus by claiming guilty recently. I'm sure that's tied in somehow.

I haven't seen the wolves go after Murdoch on anything yet, but because he is a distant out-of-touch ""owner"" of so many media properties, he can probably have plausible deniability.

This is undeniable. The OP seems to think that this constitutes a breach of trust or something. That's the part where he's wrong.

>But it proves that something as presumably innocuous (to the general public) as editing appears to be can in fact be used to promote a desired viewpoint. 

This is possible. It has not been demonstrated.

To be clear, I know nothing about the OP. The entire argument here, that the OP's opinion was omitted from the story and that that represents malpractice in journalism, rests on the assumption that the OP is a generally recognized authority figure on the topic of Bitcoin, such that any opinion of his is automatically news. If this is the case, please demonstrate it. The OP certainly isn't the one who gets to make the definitive call on his own qualification as an authority.

>It was OP's mistake first and foremost to think he could somehow be the voice of reason in the WSJ article.

Maybe, maybe not. That's your conclusion, not the reporter's. ""Give up"" is a pretty neutral phrase for ""accepting that you've lost money."" If the OP did in fact give up on the bitcoins then it's accurate reporting.

[Here is an interesting poll](http://www.igmchicago.org/igm-economic-experts-panel/poll-results?SurveyID=SV_9yFWHquReQZjC6w)    and [here is an interesting chart](http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/tgm/table.do?tab=table&plugin=1&language=en&pcode=tec00115), both of which--unless I'm missing something here-- indicate to me that the world's top economists aren't bulletproof when predicting the future.   ;2;1;False;in1cky;cfq5pdr;Open Letter to Michael Casey - WSJ reporter who butchered my comments in today's Bitcoin cover story;1z010y;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1z010y/open_letter_to_michael_casey_wsj_reporter_who/

But that's not how a central bank works. All money does not flow through one entity which the ""single point of failure"" you describe. A central bank simply influences the value of the currency.

"> Most economists agree that digital currencies would work IF there was some central authority that could regulate it, and create more bitcoins to flood the market when necessary to avoid huge boom and busts.

Most economists are on buckweed to be honest. You do not want any central point of failure and that is exactly what an central authority __IS__.

Flooding the market has a strong correlation for being one of the main causes of boom and bust cycles. (Or at least amplifing those cycles.)";1;1;False;Zarutian;cfpuuag;Open Letter to Michael Casey - WSJ reporter who butchered my comments in today's Bitcoin cover story;1z010y;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1z010y/open_letter_to_michael_casey_wsj_reporter_who/
"I don't agree with that; the regulation isn't what's necessary in order to be able to use cryptocurrency as a currency.  The fixed money supply, however, is problematic; aside from discouraging spending, it also makes loans problematic (which is vital to consider if we're trying to offer cryptocurrency as a replacement for fiat currency).

Whether or not one is a fan of it, dogecoin might be a step in the right direction here; the money supply will continue to grow, but at a steady and predictable rate (thanks to a bug that prevents the block reward from falling below 10,000 coins, IIRC), thus addressing both the main issue with Bitcoin (the fixed money supply) *and* the main issue with fiat currency (the risk of runaway hyperinflation, like what we're seeing in Zimbabwe) while not requiring any external regulation.

In other words: cryptocurrency doesn't need a central authority in order to have a money supply that can expand along with the economy said money is used in.  I don't think dogecoin is the end-all-be-all solution to this, either (since it doesn't really account for a variable rate of economic growth or - God forbid - economic downturn), but it's a good step in the direction of a cryptocurrency that can adjust for changes in economic conditions without government intervention (and/or - ideally - on a completely-automated basis with no human intervention at all).";3;1;False;northrupthebandgeek;cfpoty9;Open Letter to Michael Casey - WSJ reporter who butchered my comments in today's Bitcoin cover story;1z010y;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1z010y/open_letter_to_michael_casey_wsj_reporter_who/

">When did it become a propaganda tool?

When it was founded. You misunderstand the title. You won't catch me defending the Wall Street Journal as an unbiased publication. I don't give a shit what it thinks about stuff.

>Of course the OP is biased; but he's not the journalist!

You know, this is the first decent nugget of argument I've encountered so far in this thread. If the argument is that the WSJ is biased towards Wall Street, then I absolutely agree. 

But that's not the original complaint. My reading of the OP's rant at the top was that he felt that the report was not merely biased, but that the reporter misrepresented the words of the OP. The OP thinks that the reporter owes it to the OP to faithfully represent everything the OP said in the article. There is no such obligation. In fact, I'm far from convinced that the OP's opinion about anything constitutes news worth reporting.

If a weather reporter asked you about the weather and you said, ""It rained today. And I'm thrilled about it because it's great for the crops!""

"Where in the article did the journalist ""convey the impression"" that the OP was unhappy? I didn't see anything in the quoted material that seemed to indicate anything about the OP's emotions or opinions one way or the other. Show me this quote from the article that you're complaining about.

Basically, as I read it, the OP is enraged that the journalist did not quote any of the opinions he shared during the interview, and simply quoted him briefly on one matter of fact. That in itself does not constitute bad journalism. If there is something in the article that is actually misleading about the OP, rather than simply the absence to serve as PR for the OP, please show it.";1;1;False;splorng;cfq68ks;Open Letter to Michael Casey - WSJ reporter who butchered my comments in today's Bitcoin cover story;1z010y;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1z010y/open_letter_to_michael_casey_wsj_reporter_who/

"My comment said I was focusing on cryptocurrency related endeavours, the day-to-day management of the other companies has long since been palmed off, and I've taken a further step back by handing off operational control to a different board member. Our cryptocurrency businesses make up around 3% of the group revenue, and around 4% of the EBITDA of the group.

So if all cryptocurrencies evaporated overnight we would be left bag-holding with assets we can sell as well as a few assets that are effectively worthless in an evaporated market. However, the handful of functions performed by full-time employees (as opposed to group-level employees that handle many functions such as support, finances, logistics, administration, and so on) are typical startup employees - innovative, multi-skilled, multi-roled - they can be re-deployed within the group.

My salary is fixed and would not change regardless of positive or negative press. The only thing that would change is (by a few %) are my bonus cheques, which are based on net profit. Additionally, we don't have holdings in Bitcoin (we process payments through BitPay and by and large have them pay us in ZAR and not BTC), and I am not adding to my small cold wallet anytime soon, so market movement doesn't affect my assets or the group's assets.";0;0;False;fluffyponyza;cfpxoqj;Open Letter to Michael Casey - WSJ reporter who butchered my comments in today's Bitcoin cover story;1z010y;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1z010y/open_letter_to_michael_casey_wsj_reporter_who/

"Are banks insured in China like they are here?  I honestly don't know.

If people can't trust that their money stays in the bank when they put it there, the people won't use banks.  Our banks are federally insured in the US because of that.  The $87,000 and the cost of the investigation just gets taxed from the rest of us and put back in the accounts.

There's only one reason I'm willing to shop online.  Because the credit company allows me to dispute a fraudulent charge.  (I still refuse to use my debit card.)  I know six people locally who've had their cards stolen and used, probably from database break-ins.  One had to borrow money from friends to pay for lunch for a week, because he was left without any way of accessing his money or his credit until the investigation closed and he had new accounts.

I refuse to keep my card number on xbox live, psn or steam, because they're too high-profile targets.  (Also, all have been hacked.)

A few months ago, some jackass with a botnet decided it would be fun to DDOS the steam store and keep people from buying during the holiday sales.  Was there any redeeming reason for that?

Anyway, the america comment is still applicable for most of europe in that my underlying point was that you have freedom of speech and can openly choose your views.

But I think that you can't signal out any group of people and say 'they don't change for evidence' because that's on an individual level. 

Id also like to point out that being open to new ideas swings both ways. It helped many social injustices.... buuut it also helped bring about dictatorships that lead to countless deaths.

"""he felt that the report was not merely biased, but that the reporter misrepresented the words of the OP.""

The words were reported accurately, but very, very selectively. That's what OP is on about: that his optimistic opinion as an advocate of the currency was excluded. Not just toned down or disclaimered, but completely sanitized. Even something as simple as ""..and yet he still remains bullish about BC's future."" would have avoided most of the bad feelings, IMO.

""That's not bad journalism, that's just editing.""

But it proves that something as presumably innocuous (to the general public) as editing appears to be can in fact be used to promote a desired viewpoint. I note that the WSJ tried to contact other, more famous BitCoin proponents (the Winkelvoss twins) but found them ""unavailable for comment"". From this I take it that they were looking for some pro-bitcoin person to make some kind of statement that could be construed in a way that fit the tone of the article.

It was OP's mistake first and foremost to think he could somehow be the voice of reason in the WSJ article. Yet I can't help but think that the reporter may have misled him in their initial conversation. Or OP is naive. I don't know.

Imagine, for a moment, trying to enforce an Internet Ban when technology is powerful and compact enough and the world is connected enough that internet-ready devices are almost omnipresent. Hackers, particularly ""hacktivists"", that are banned from owning computers and accessing the internet still manage to do it fairly often. At great risk, sure, but it happens anyway. It is reaching a point of nigh unenforceability unless you remove said person from society all together or have them literally watched every second of every minute of everyday until such a time that their ban is lifted. It is a daunting task, and I do not envy anyone charged with monitoring people banned from using computers and the internet. Hell, I don't envy parole officers, in general. I imagine it to be a tough, unrewarding, and demoralizing job most of the time.

I agree with your point regarding who does it having an influence on people's attitudes.

"mthreat,

That doesn't sound like a thing an actual journalist would say.  Is that a direct quote or your paraphrase?

Every professional journalist I know (and any journalist worth their salt) would tell you the same thing; while it's true that journalists aren't necessarily out to advocate for any of the sources they interview for their stories, their [ethical standards](http://www.spj.org/ethicscode.asp) tend to be pretty damn high (outside of Fox ""News"" and some lousy papers and tabloids here and there anyway).  Their goal is to write the truest story they can and not merely whatever they or their editors believe will drive the most web traffic.

Plenty of journalists have written endearing stories that show the human side of people who have done bad things (I can put together a list with the most cursory of googling if you don't believe me).  If you came out looking like a dick in a profile piece...have you ever considered that maybe you are kind of a dick (or at least came off that way to the reporter who interviewed you)?

"You're being very disingenuous, at least with yourself. To say you don't care about losing 300,000 dollars is a damn joke and a lie. The reporter is a professional and the story here is that he found a person that lost 300 grand. He gave you 20 minutes of his the time to listen to your story as to why you're still bullish on bit coin and you tried to feed him the coolaid that he didn't buy, probably cause you lost your credibility since no sane person would say they don't care about losing 300,000 dollars. You losing something like 8 times the average annual income of a US resident is the real story here, the reporter was smart enough to recognize it and maybe you should recognize it too.

Glad he contacted you and explained. Also glad you posted this, because as a reporter, I know we sometimes overlook who's on the other end of a story. That said, I can vouch that it's difficult to always convey exactly what an interview is trying to get across because you're so, so constrained by time (in TV news) and space (in print).

"Peter Schiff is a joke. He's come forth to say that he said it, and meant it, he just doesn't like how negative it sounds... you know, without a batch of rhetoric behind it stating how it isn't as bad as it sounds. He assumes people only thought it was bad or that he looked bad only because the daily show didn't show all 4 hours of his propaganda. But nobody that doesn't already accept his argument would buy into it, it's just worse (more fuel to the fire).

Instead of a soapbox like he expected he got a miniature debate in which he got cornered by his views. I'm not sure why he expected a show lasting half an hour was going to show everything he said in 4 hours.

I'm sure there are good examples of this happening, but Peter Schiff is not one of them. His views align pretty much perfectly with what was shown.";4;2;False;GMNightmare;cfpmh2l;Open Letter to Michael Casey - WSJ reporter who butchered my comments in today's Bitcoin cover story;1z010y;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1z010y/open_letter_to_michael_casey_wsj_reporter_who/

"You can't control the story by being interviewed. Its usually the off the cuff remarks that hit the front page, The Stuff people say after they relax because they think the interview is over. People always think they are conveying an overall message because they view each item in the context of the whole. ""It sucks that I lost my BTC but I know that bitcoin is bigger and better than gox"" becomes ""It sucks that I lost my BTC"" in the headline. Its why politicians scrutinize every word and try to view each phrase out of context to see how it could be used to manipulate the message.

My favourite example is where Phil Enselmo made some dumb comments after the ineterview was over and they were walking out, ""Dimebag needs to beaten severely"".

"I didn't get burned that bad, really.  However, the things I said were chopped up and spliced to fit the narrative of the local news.

It felt more than a bit like a betrayal.  I said nothing in confidence, and I meant what I said.

You know the ""chopped and screwed"" hip hop coming out of houston that's all samples?  That's basically what they made out of our interview.  We were on lunch break, about 2 days after a couple close friends had died, and they chopped the soundbites to make us sound like uncaring monsters.

Having a camera shoved in my face and a microphone basically face-raping me while I stood there, in uniform, talking about something that affected me deeply getting chopped up and edited to fit a narrative really struck a nerve.

I can't take the news media seriously anymore.  We were gearing up for Iraq, and the men who died in that crash were both close personal friends of mine.  Instead of a story about a dedicated maintenance pilot and an eager beaver newbie who took my spot and borrowed my gear, I got to hear about how negligent and horrible the US Army was for 3 months with my own quotes taken out of context.  It was a gross perversion of the actual facts of what happened and it denigrated a guy I cared a lot about and cast a man who was thoroughly dedicated to bettering himself as a loose cannon and an innocent little lamb with wool pulled over his eyes, respectively.

I was once told by an Iraqi Air Force LT that ""I appreciate what you Americans have done for our country, and once you leave it would pain my soul to shoot you down"" once we'd traded a can of Copenhagen for a pair of Wild Tiger energy drinks at a bus stop in Tikrit.

If that 19 year old fighter pilot got scrambled to support US ground troops, I'm sure he'd have done his absolute best.  He meant what he said.  He would do whatever it took to make a sovereign Iraq safe for all Iraqi's.  We meant what we said, we wanted the Iraqi's to have real sovereignty.  If you took our conversation and compressed it down to soundbites, it'd have come out looking threatening.

That kid meant what he said, I meant what I said, and it could be chopped up and sold for headlines.

The real headline should have been ""Iraqi LT and American Sgt. find common ground and exchange gifts, kids from Suleyman and Missouri find common ground and get identical haircuts."" but that's not newsworthy.

I think the Iraqi's would like to settle their own scores.  Or maybe not, since we integrated their forces pretty well.  It's not a perfect peace.  It wasn't a perfect war.

Maybe this for a headline : ""Iraq still a clusterfuck, but at least now the Iraqi's can sort it out on their own terms.""

I don't want to fire on LT whatsisface.  I don't think LT whatsisface would take any great satisfaction in killing Sgt. Whatsisname in defense of a group of people who tend to kind of miss ole' Sgt. Whatsisname.

We were there, we did what we could, and the locals will have to live with it.  And they did what they could, and I wish them the best, but they aren't going to forget old whatsisname or whatsisnose.";1;0;False;groundciv;cfpyeg8;Open Letter to Michael Casey - WSJ reporter who butchered my comments in today's Bitcoin cover story;1z010y;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1z010y/open_letter_to_michael_casey_wsj_reporter_who/

"Important lesson here: 

>*""Every journalist who is not too stupid or too full of himself to notice what is going on knows that what he does is morally indefensible. He is a kind of confidence man, preying on people's vanity, ignorance or loneliness, gaining their trust and betraying them without remorse. Like the credulous widow who wakes up one day to find the charming young man and all her savings gone, so the consenting subject of a piece of nonfiction writing learns -when the article or book appears - his hard lesson. Journalists justify their treachery in various ways according to their temperaments. The more pompous talk about freedom of speech and 'the public's right to know'; the least talented talk about Art; the seemliest murmur about earning a living.""*

"I did a little bit of media training back in the day, but most of it seemed pretty common sense even at the time. There's basically only 1 trick to it for all the money they charge you. You should go into every single interview with a purpose. If you go into an interview without a purpose then the reporter can easily spin what you say into anything they want. Come up with 2-3 talking points to support your purpose and keep saying those in different ways. This is literally stuff you can come up with 10 minutes before the interview in your head.

I was a journalism major as an undergraduate at one of the top journalism programs in the U.S. My junior year, I had an epiphany that I wasn't cut out for the job when I was writing a story *for a class*, no less, about the danger/evil of megachurches. I met a wonderful pastor of a megachurch and felt like the biggest liar in the world when I was nodding and smiling, sounding understanding to elicit more responses, and to gain that person's trust--all so I could turn around and write it from the angle that I already had in mind. I know some people have the ability to be distant from their interviewees/subjects, but I realized I didn't, and decided to be a high school teacher instead.

To you. Apparently not to Mr. Casey. His byline, his call what's important.

>I didn't expect you to quote everything I said, but should you not have maintained at least a modicum of fidelity to my message?

Nobody owes you any fidelity. The journalist asked questions, you spoke for 20 minutes, and the journalist gets to decide what to take away from that, not you.

Your ""open letter"" drips of entitlement. A free press is a cornerstone of society. A journalist's duty is to report the story as he or she sees it, not to transcribe and report somebody's message based on that person's idea of his or her importance to the world. Was the story factually inaccurate? That's a legitimate complaint. Do you disagree with the reporter's conclusions? Then go out and prove him wrong. You don't get to complain that a reporter used your quote for his own purposes. That's what reporters do. The Wall Street Journal is not your bitch. Neither is anybody else.

"Hilarious and sad reading these vapid and childish tantrums about ""the media"".  The perennial cry of the manipulators and liars is ""don't report what I said, report what I meant"".  You have a problem with being taken out of context?  Complain to the Paper's editor before taking your case to the mobs of Reddit.  Then after you've made your case and received a correction (because after all you were misquoted, right?) boast about your victory over unscrupulous journalists.  Still feel like your reputation suffered a hit because you were fooled into speaking your mind?  Sue.  But that requires certainty.  Not some specious claim that can't be verified except by the only two people who were party to the comments.  I have no idea what you said to the WSJ journalist.  But not all journalists are writing books.  They aren't interested in your thoughts about world peace when they're focussing a financial story.  Unless you had an agreement that all of your comments would be printed verbatim you are beyond naive. You're being disingenuous. You're doing a drive-by smear on someone who relies on their reputation.  Nice.  You are also perpetuating a destructive stereotype about a vital profession.  I am a journalist who works with ethics, protects sources, and risks his reputation every time he exposes corruption, lies and manipulation, in the service of the public interest.  Appealing to the rabble on reddit with some one-sided sob story about how ""the media"" is evil, shows how easy you think it is to manipulate public opinion. Claims like this one  make the best arguments for why a legitimate  fourth estate - not conspiracy theorists typing comments between bouts of Sky Rim and posting pictures of their cat and dog ""children""  - is so critical.

"Dear Mr. Voorhees,

As a result of your sustained attack on the blockchain in the name of, as you put it, stress-testing, your refusal to operate your business in any other way regardless of feedback, and the amusing differential in traffic pre- and post-sale, I'm afraid your ability to engender sympathy from basically any one of us who remembers what you were involved in has been permanently impaired.

"Having been interview for newspaper and TV (nothing major) I can say that reporters will get your comments wrong every single time. If you comment on anything slightly technical or scientific they will spectacularly misinterpret your comments.  That's why news reports keep claiming that new studies show X why the study actually shows M. 

Always maintain copies of interviews in case the reporter claims you said something you did not.  An audio recorder is fairly cheap, heck your smartphone  could probably record a short interview. If you are interviewed on video then you also need a version of the video for yourself.

>**Pravda** ([Russian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language): Правда, IPA: [ˈpravdə] , ""Truth"") is a Russian political newspaper associated with the [Communist Party of the Russian Federation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_the_Russian_Federation). The newspaper was started by the Russian Revolutionaries during the pre-World War I days and emerged as a leading newspaper of the [Soviet Union](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union) after the [Russian Revolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Revolution). The newspaper also served as a central organ of the [Central Committee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Committee_of_the_Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union) of the [RSDLP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Social_Democratic_Labour_Party) and the [CPSU](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union) between 1912 and 1991.

>After the dissolution of the USSR, Pravda was closed down by the then Russian President [Boris Yeltsin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Yeltsin). As was the fate of many of the Soviet-era enterprises Pravda too suffered a huge economic downfall and after that the paper was sold to a Greek business family. Finally the [Communist Party of Russian Federation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_Russian_Federation) acquired the newspaper in 1997 and established it as its principal mouthpiece. Pravda is still functioning from the same headquarters on Pravda Street in [Moscow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow) where it was published in the Soviet days. During its heyday Pravda was selling millions of copies per day compared to the current print run of just one hundred thousand copies. 

>During the [Cold War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War), Pravda was well known in the [West](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world) for its pronouncements as the official voice of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. (Similarly Izvestia was the official voice of the Soviet government.)

"You can Google the basic information, but to make a long story short it was a wardialer, a program that would dial all the numbers in a telephone exchange and record the results. The point of this was to discover computer systems with dial-up access which you could then attempt to break into remotely. You can see one in action [here in this scene from the movie *Wargames*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AByemfK_qD4).

Part of what made TonLoc unique was that it took advantage of certain features in U.S. Robotics modems that would give you results beyond the average wardialer. If you had ToneLoc and the right modem, you could find all sort of strange things besides computers. Thanks to ToneLoc, I was the kid in high school who could get you free untraceable phone calls to anywhere in the world.

"As a journalist I felt compelled to respond to your arguments.

>They are uneducated about anything they write about

Frankly, that's incredibly unfair. If that really was the case none of us would have jobs. We're not experts in most things, but nobody is. That's why we get in touch with people who specialise in the topic in question to explain it to us and the readers. It's also why a lot of journalists have specialities. I'm the health reporter on the paper I work on now and was a political reporter in my last job. I couldn't tell you anything about how the stock markets or school league tables work, but I could easily tell you about the difference between clinical commissioning groups and NHS Trusts or the structure of local government.

>have word limits

True, word limits are restrictive. I dread to think how many hours I've lost trying to cut an 1,000 word article to 350 words without losing the point. *But* being able to do so is just what we're trained to do. A really good journalist (and I'm not necessarily including myself in that) can explain a complex issue in very few words. 


>are lazy 

Some people are lazy, that's just how the world is. But to say we're *all* lazy? Hardly fair. I frequently do 12+ hour days, despite only being paid for eight, simply because that's the only way to get anything done. I think what's frequently seen as lazy journalism from an outside perspective is just a result of the pressures we work under. There's fewer and fewer people doing the same amount of work and, frankly, if I have to copy and paste a half-decent press release on council tax so I can spend my time working on something more important, that's what I'm going to do.

>and selectively quote (or mis-quote) to fit a narrative because it flows better. Or something.

Yes, some people do this, but anyone who does is not a good journalist.

You're entitled to your opinion of course and if you've been burned by some hacks I totally understand, but I felt your comments were generalising in an unfair way.

The enforcement in cases like this isn't trying to block the person from doing the thing they are banned from doing.  It's that they will be punished if they are caught doing it.  For example, I knew a guy on probation for public intoxication. He was banned from possessing  or consuming alcohol...  It didn't stop the local store from selling it to him.  It did mean that when he invited the cop into his house related to a noise complaint... he went back to jail  because he had a case of beer on his table.;9;1;False;shibarib;cfpou0b;Open Letter to Michael Casey - WSJ reporter who butchered my comments in today's Bitcoin cover story;1z010y;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1z010y/open_letter_to_michael_casey_wsj_reporter_who/

"In 1991 I was busted for various hacking charges due to fallout after Operation Sundevil.

They can't 100% enforce the ban, but the threat of going back to prison would be enough to convince quite a few people. And, depending on the state, it's possible that the banned person might be subject to polygraph tests.

Check out the compound that End of an Ear Records sits in. Walk around the river by the Campbell's Hole or Twin Falls areas, skip the Barton Springs Pool/Zilker Park area. They're great, sure, but if you don't have a lot of time...skip it. Unless the water's flowing really well, in that case, squeeze through the bars that block people from entering the concrete pipe thingy that diverts the river before the pools and then flows back in to the river. Ride that shit like whatever that ride is at the water park that's completely black and neat. 6th street is cool and all, to see, for a night. One night is all you need there, though. See it, experience it, then be done and go see all the other rad fuckin' spots. Flipnotiks has an awesome patio(s) and listening room for shows. The Daily Juice is a really cool juice/smoothie place. OH! for food or bars check out the little area just west of 35 and south of cesar chavez, behind the IHOP (if the IHOP's still there), there's a bunch of great bars and restaurants inside what used to be neat ol' houses. There's also a really great Indian restaurant there with a bunch of awesome floats(?) that they use for some sort of traditional Indian parade/party that happens sometimes. There is a dog that lives in the little shack behind that place that is not nice. Do not try to befriend that dog. He will nip your ankle and make it bleed. Possibly. Heard from a friend. Go to Pipes Plus and have a bit of hookah and a board game. Spend some time on South Congress. Watch Waking Life and/or Slacker and visit the places from those movies that are still around. Go to the Starbucks just behind the old movie theater turned tower records turned cvs/campus bookstore and wish that it was still Les Amis Cafe. Even though you never visited Les Amis Cafe.

"If it were real money laundering charges, they would have been able to get subpoenas easily. Bitcoin is that it's all digital so everything is traceable. If the balance is irreconcilable then it's very likely that you may not be in possession of all required pieces to substantiate your claim. It's also difficult to hand over support that contains sensitive information if the person requesting it refuses to provide verified credentials of their identity. 

It's also difficult to give complete and substantiated responses when:

* the posts are being made on the internet which is [presumably] publicly accessible. 
* any information stated on a public forum could be in violation of certain agreements made
* the identity of the requestor is unknown. Is it the client? Is it law enforcement? Is it a competitor attempting to obtain company secrets? Again, asking over the internet is not the way to handle sensitive matters especially if one's reputation is at stake.
* trust is unverifiable. Someone has to start telling the truth from the very beginning but when someone begins to disclose information and then that very information is used to create several more accusations then there is little point in disclosing anything at all.
* assumptions make everyone look bad. I know that I have not knowingly betrayed anyone's trust nor do I intend to.
