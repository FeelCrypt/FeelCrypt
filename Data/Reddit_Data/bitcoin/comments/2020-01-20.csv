"**Public-key cryptography**

Public-key cryptography, or asymmetric cryptography, is a cryptographic system that uses pairs of keys: public keys which may be disseminated widely, and private keys which are known only to the owner. The generation of such keys depends on cryptographic algorithms based on mathematical problems to produce one-way functions. Effective security only requires keeping the private key private; the public key can be openly distributed without compromising security.In such a system, any person can encrypt a message using the receiver's public key, but that encrypted message can only be decrypted with the receiver's private key.

Robust authentication is also possible.

"Sure. 


The goal of the #blockchaincentermiami 2020 hackathon was to create something unique that helps introduce & onboard new users to crypto! We were so incredibly fortunate that the universe aligned us with the seriously incredible @dowhatyoulove.artist to create the first ever interactive bitcoin art piece! 

We stayed up all night working together to create this art hoping it would show people how fun, easy to use and awesome #bitcoin & #cryptocurrency can be! 

The art has 44 Tangem BTC wallets in it. These are physical wallet that can be scanned with NFC to verify the balance and sign a transaction sending the balance to another wallet. The cards are unique in that no one can export the private key from them but anyone can drop bits on them with the public addresses. We’re not sharing these publicly yet because a prospective buyer may not want us to. 

In creating it we have realized that this could be used for games, as a physical faucet, or many more things.

Sadly, we did not win the hackathon but our spirits celebrate in the fact that we were brought together for this divine experience & have created something that has never been done before. There is something so thrilling about creating permanent artwork, it’s a snap shot of the love, energy, spirit & genius that was poured into its creation that will last forever! Can’t wait to take this thing on the road to set up games and activations that will bring #cryptocurrency to the world!";4;1;False;kylekemper;ff3u1g9;“Do What You Love” crypto Art contains 44 BTC Swiss Key Tangem wallets.

I didn't deny that it's a fad. 

That all sounds well and good but here's the fundamental issue:

Do you need blockchain?

1.) Do you need to store data? Cool, tons of use cases, also tons of solutions


2.) Do you need your data to be decentralized? ok cool, still quite a few use cases, still quite a few solutions


3.) You need participants in this decentralized database to be able to read and write to it _without permission_ ? um...use cases narrowing fast now..but you _might_ need a solution like the blockchain

4.) Is your data really important? Or is it ok if I write garbage to it?

5.) Does your use case provide an incentive for a a sufficient number of independent, untrusted nodes to secure your permissionless, centralized database?

What Andreas is referring to is importing a *private key) into a bitcoin wallet app, and then spending some of the funds, and then deleting the app.

The reason that is dangerous is because the app might have put the ""change"" for the spend transaction into its own address, a ""change address"".  That's recommended behavior, but not all wallet apps do that.  Anyway, ... if you then delete the app, you've also deleted the private key for the ""change address"", and the funds are no longer spendable.

What you are describing is importing a mnemonic phrase / seed.   That seed controls all the addresses that are generated. So a mnemonic doesn't have the risk that Andreas is describing there.  You could delete the app and recover again from the mnemonic and no funds would be lost.

"> It will be hard to cover hardware costs with 1.5625 BTC?

Today the hashrate is 110 EH/s.  A year ago it was less than 40 EH/s.   Was bitcoin really nearly 2/3rds less safe a year ago?   Of course not.

It's like if you ask a bank vault engineer how thick the steel walls need to be to protect against a cutting torch over a 3 day weekend, and the response is 6 inches, ... so you believe that a 12 inch steel wall is twice as safe.   It's not.  Safe enough is safe enough.

So the halving may even cause hashrate to drop ... that's happened, .. but the level of hashrate will still be so enormous that a 51% attack is not anything to be concerned about.    The obsolete (inefficient) hardware gets decommissioned and the better performing hardware keeps hashing.  

There's not enough of the decommissioned hardware alone to pose a threat and even if an attacker used the old hardware plus additional hashrate acquisitions, there's no way this attacker could amass the enormous level of hashrate needed without the endeavor being discovered. 

The goal of the attacker isn't to prove that 51% of the combined total hashrate can really be attained, the goal is to cheat the exchanges by double spending that a successful 51% attack permits.   Well ... a 51% attack could end up being technically successful, ibut f the exchanges didn't fall for it, the attacker just wasted money, time, effort, and possibly their freedom.

So no, a shrinking amount of bitcoin going to miners due to halvings is not a concern. At least as not as far as a 51% attack is concerned.

Incidentally, we've had two halvings and hashrate hasn't decreased significantly, ... for various reasons.   I doubt the next few halvings won't be any different, and well before the end of that, fees will be the vast majority of the miner's revenues.";1;0;False;cointastical;ff339bv;How will miners cover the electricty cost in 2028 when 1.5625 BTC will be a reward for them;ercsta;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ercsta/how_will_miners_cover_the_electricty_cost_in_2028/

yes this is true too. But what we keep seeing is that when the price hits new highs everyone gets fomo and tries to buy in. which should soak up the supply from the people selling. Im sure there would be converts from the new crowd into hodlers too. so the supply gets smaller again. remember there are only 21 million of these things 6million lost already if i remember correctly. So the supply isnt really that big. I wonder when the next fomo crowd will come in again. its gonna have to go past the last all time high. and stay above it i think.

"Bitcoin uses between 80% and 90% renewable energy, and the figure continues to climb by all accounts. Not sure there's an industry out there that can compete with that.

Humans have access to *hundreds* of times more energy than we currently use. But we chose instead to use fossil fuels because they are easy to transport to our population concentrations. It is this pattern of usage, rather than bitcoin mining (which can be done anywhere), that has facilitated so much pollution.

Bitcoin is a key technology in the fight against climate change. Government fiat currency allows for endless war, and foments a global economy optimized for resource depletion. Hard/sound money pushes in the opposite direction, since governments can no longer fund their armies with the stroke of a pen, and consumers are no longer forced to throw their fiat at *anything*, before it becomes worthless.

"The energy IS used for a purpose, that purpose is ensuring your money has unforgeable scarcity. Check out the article I posted, it is very good.

Thanks to the energy use you know your wealth is preserved (not debased through easy money printing, pre-mining, etc) and you know it is secured (the cost of stealing pretty much matches the cost of creating it). 

The fact that it's just ""finding a number"" is irrelevant, it's a mechanism to provide the required properties - what matters is what you get in return for that energy use. Coins advertising ""low energy use"" and ""fast transfers"" inevitably make compromises in both how easy it is to generate/inflate supply and how easy it is to attack it.

You shouldn't focus on the details of finding the hashes, but on the reason why that hardness is important. The energy use is that makes BTC both valuable and secure and energy is the ultimate value (even matter like Gold is ultimately energy).

Printing paper fiat might be cheaper, but it won't preserve your wealth, does not provide security and it also uses a lot of energy if you consider the whole financial industry involved (same for Gold, as mining+storing+moving safely is costly, although it doesn't require a network constantly working).

I think in a [perhaps distant] future, wealth/cost won't be measured in national currencies as we do now, but in energy like kWh (directly or indirectly), ultimately representing the time capital invested.

"**World energy consumption**

World energy consumption is the total energy produced and used by the entire human civilization. Typically measured per year, it involves all energy harnessed from every energy source applied towards humanity's endeavors across every single industrial and technological sector, across every country. It does not include energy from food, and the extent to which direct biomass burning has been accounted for is poorly documented.  Being the power source metric of civilization, world energy consumption has deep implications for humanity's socio-economic-political sphere.

"You are starting with a false premise.  That is a logical fallacy.

&#x200B;

Bitcoin's energy consumption: 3 shots vs 55 gallons

Some ""alarmists"" claim that Bitcoin uses a *whopping* 66.7 Tera Watt hours of electricity per year. ""Almost as much as the Czech Rebublic"". They're trying to make it sound like a lot.

Is it a significant amount?

The world uses 110,000 Tera Watt hours of electricity per year. One hundred and ten thousand. Bitcoin uses sixty seven.

Bitcoin uses about six ten-thousandths of the total energy consumed by humans. 0.0006 or **$.06 out of $100.00**.

Six cents out of a hundred bucks.

One **inch** out of **137 feet**.

Two or three shots from a 55 gallon drum.

A quarter pound meat patty compared to a 412 lb fatso.

**One second vs 27 minutes and 30 seconds.**

Is that really a significant amount?

Another thing some of the ""alarmists"" claim - that the energy used by Bitcoin is ""wasted"". I say that energy is put to good use, not wasted.

When somebody brings up Bitcoin's energy usage, politely ask them to just shut the fuck up until they know what they're talking about.

"It is not a waste of resources at all. All the energy used is used for a purpose and returns value. [BTC doesn't use too much energy, it uses just the right amount of energy to make it the most secure wealth-preserving network in the planet.](https://medium.com/the-bitcoin-times/proof-of-work-the-fundamental-laws-of-physics-and-nature-33d95167c57a) The ""Waste"" argument is nonsense as it assumes it has no value, which is untrue.

As for ""Governments banning it"", that argument is past due. [Can't put the genie back in the bottle anymore. It would be an endless game of whack-a-mole and conflicting interests between different nation states.](https://twitter.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1197161029832265729?s=20) Countries can't even synch on on much easier problems, let alone agree (and be able to enforce) such a global ban.

"Can banning stop the usage? No, money will contunie to change hands

can banning stop the miners? no, even with bans people will still contunie and take risks(we had bans in some countries)

is bitcoin really wasting resource comparing to paper money? imagine cutting trees, inventing special inks, hiring thousands  of people to print,secure,transport the paper money/gol/silver ext. comparing to bitcoin

İs health organization have a legal power? No, their decisions does not have a legal enforceabel power over people

What if governments step up and ban? They had the chance before it went mainstream between 2011-2016 now its too powerfull and in use by millioners/billioners. Who can control that amount of money, can also buy governments and stop them from happening.

Can governments get together and ban it all at once? No, international relationships are too shaddy and controlled by the monopolist, bitcoin is like gold and can be transported/spend internationally there for even if your country bans it, you can still spend sell/buy it on other parts of the world (without traveling)

"$20,000 definitely.

Something really crazy would have to happen for it to go down much.  Adoption is continually increasing, and since Bitcoin is a percentage based currency, where every coin generated is a fixed proportion of the whole, then as long as more individuals want Bitcoin, the value has to go up, on average.  Which is what has been happening for a decade.

"> There is a good chance he wont trade and just take my money right?

He could have cheated many people that way, and you wouldn't know.  That's because LBC ratings only are for on-platform trades.  

Personally, I've ""gone first"" on a trade (sending funds first, either bitcoin, or fiat), based on the counterparty's trust history.  If there have been negatives, ... or not that many transactions, I've insisted on escrow.    There was this one time though, someone with a really good trust history on LocalBitcoin (like 400 transactions, and 99%, ... I can't remember the negative) asked me to release the coins first, stating that he needed the BTC for another trade in which the fiat to pay me was coming.    That was the third time this person asked me to do that, and the previous ones he paid promptly, so I didn't think twice.  

Zap!!!  Sure enough, it was the long con / exit.   There ended up being about a half dozen of us he suckered that day most reporting similar circumstances ... prior transactions where funds were released early.    I got taken for something like $700 worth, if I remember. 

Since that time, I've seen traders buying and selling KYC'd Localbitcoins accounts.  So an account with a perfect trust history may not mean you are trading with the person who earned that perfect trust history. 

You could lessen your risk by doing smaller sized transactions,...  $e.g., 0.1 BTC at a time?  If no problem after 0.5, then do 0.25 for the last two.

Or use a cheaper escrow method.  For example, on HodlHodl P2P exchange, the transaction is a multisig, but there is an arbitrator you can use if you don't get the coins.  It's a much smaller fee than LocalBitcoins.

Or, is it possible to meet in person.  I've done buy trades where I've delivered cash to the seller in the lobby of their bank.  They then release the coins, then turn around and deposit the cash.";3;1;False;cointastical;ff2truk;First bitcoin purchase;er9m2p;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/er9m2p/first_bitcoin_purchase/

The price will just sit there with a bunch of 666 figures showing, which from my understanding can only be due to one thing: a lot of bids being made at that price.

Now why would anyone do that? Hmmm let's see:

- As a big fuck you

"Yes it is relevant, because as long as it was under $200 it wouldn't matter, even in an absolute worst-case scenario where you had no recollection and/or records of any of the cryptocurrency assets you owned and assumed you purchased them when they were 1 cent each in 2010. You could always spend $200 without worry.

But that is pretty unreasonable. All you need to know is what the lowest price of some of the coins was that you purchased. Take Bitcoin for example. Let's say I know it was purchased at some point(s) between 2018 and today (January 2020), but I don't know which coins were purchased when, and/or which coins I am spending. Perhaps I know the exact price of the cheapest coins I purchased. Perhaps I don't. Let's use the latter.

In the case of the latter, if I know the date range of the period I bought of some of the coins I owned was, but not the exact date, I could just use the lowest price of Bitcoin for that date range. In the case of January 2018 to today, that price was about $3200.

$3200 divided by $8650 is .37

This means any time I am spending something, I need to remember that 63 cents of every dollar is capital gains.

Since I know my limit is $200 of capital gains per transaction, I know I can safely spend $298 (200 divided by .67) per transaction without ever possibly being in violation of the law.

EDIT: And I can just do that each time I buy something, divide the lowest common denominator (in this case $3200) by the current price of the cryptocurrency.

And again, even in this complete amnesiac situation you are describing, I know that I can always make purchases up to, in the absolute worst-case scenario, $200.";2;1;False;333929;ff3j2uw;Proposed bill in US House of Representatives to allow any personal transaction to be excluded from capital gains tax as long as **PROFIT** is less than $200.

"Yes, you are correct, that is the right section.

The IRS is surprisingly, to me, vague on their definition of ""personal transaction"". I am not a legal or tax expert so it's very possible I am missing something well-known or simple.

In section 988(e), transactions meeting the definitions of section 212 and 162 are excluded, but I have read those, and they are not relevant to our situation. I am trying to find out further clarifications about what constitutes a ""personal transaction"". The bill in front of the house is in draft form.

EDIT: One thing that may nullify your [original comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/er8p37/proposed_bill_in_us_house_of_representatives_to/ff3cv2o/), if nothing else did, is that it sounds an awful lot like [structuring](https://www.irs.gov/irm/part4/irm_04-026-013), which is completely illegal in the United States and many countries.

That would be an extra tax.

A capital gains tax is another, entirely different, (and thus ""extra"") tax.

"> treating cryptocurrency like regular currency

I agree with you, but we'll take what we can get. This would still be HUGE and would cover 95% of regular transactions:

From an earlier comment I [wrote](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/er8fu9/proposed_bill_in_us_house_of_representatives_to/ff2azal/)

The US government views cryptocurrency as property. Every time you trade it for something, you owe money on the capital gains. For example, if you buy $100 worth of BCH at $100 per coin, then it goes up to $300 per coin, you will owe capital gains taxes on that $200 profit if you were to trade it for something else (spend it as payment). If you bought $300 worth of food at the store, you would have to pay capital gains taxes on that $200 of gain. The same is true, even if you buy a cup of coffee for $3. $2 would be have to be reported and taxed at capital gains rates.

However, what this bill would do, is exclude all personal transactions in which the person gained $200 or less in profit at the time they spent it. So in the above analogy, the $300 purchase at the grocery store, and the $3 cup of coffee, would both not have to be reported and taxed, because each transaction did not have more than $200 in profit. This bill, in reality, covers 95% of daily transactions. Purchases under $200 wouldn't even be able to be taxed.

My wife and I would like to emphasize our support for the bill being drafted, ""Virtual Currency Tax Fairness Act of 2020"". We think this bill would present a much more reasonable and clarified approach to taxing small amounts of virtual currency. As it stands today, ALL virtual currency transactions are handled as capital gains exchanges, making the simple act of buying a coffee akin to a stock or gold trade in which gains must be tabulated (yes, even for a $4 tab). This bill would introduce a reasonable, but small amount threshold beneath which tax would be exempt. Such relief from the earlier, misguided approach by the IRS would smooth the way for increasing innovation and investment within the virtual currency and tech sector. It would also greatly simplify bookkeeping and tax reporting procedures for ordinary citizens who consider virtual currency as not only a long term investment vehicle but as a functioning alternative type of currency as well.

"Also, since many folks are confused, most humans don't even have to pay long term capital gains tax at all on investment profit, since you have to have a yearly income above about $40,000 before it kicks in.  So as long as you hodl for at least a year, and you're not at least reasonably rich, you're fine.

If you buy 1 btc at 100, 1 btc at 200 and then sell 1.5 btc at 500, assuming first in first out, your profit would be $550, which would be applicable to capital gains tax.  $400 on that first bitcoin and then $150 on that second 0.5 bitcoin.

You have to keep track of each transaction and then apply either ""first in first out"" or ""last in first out"" accounting to each subset of bitcoin to calculate the cost basis.

"> this makes Bitcoin get treated the same at foreign currency for capital gains purposes

From the bill:

> VIRTUALCURRENCY.—For purposes of this section, the  term ‘virtual  currency’ means a digital representation  of value that is used as a medium of exchange and is **not otherwise currency under section 988.**

From section 988:

>  26 U.S. Code § 988. Treatment of certain foreign currency transactions: Except as otherwise provided in this section, any **foreign currency** gain or loss attributable to a section 988 transaction shall be computed separately and treated as ordinary income or loss (as the case may be).

Basically, my reading of the bill, is allowing for a modification of the 1986 tax rules, which were written when virtual currencies did not exist, to allow for the same personal exemptions that foreign currencies have for personal transactions, while explicitly making clear that virtual currencies are **not** otherwise defined by the section 988 rules.

Edit: Section 988 is specifically about _foreign currency_, in case I wasn't clear. This bill specifically says virtual currencies are ""_not otherwise currency under section 988_""

I.e. if you look at Lithium 20 years ago, flow was very limited due to limited needs. Fast forward the electric car industry and Lithium needs skyrocketed, which depleted all stock and flow had to take pace. Last few years balance changed once more since this extreme demand caused many new mining initiatives and flow finally met expectations causing further stocks. Inflation throughout these two decades on the other hand was pretty static.;12;1;False;justinjustinian;ff27imm;Stock-to-flow is just the inverse of the inflation rate, nothing more;er81sh;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/er81sh/stocktoflow_is_just_the_inverse_of_the_inflation/
"Well for that you would probably get a better information from geology subs, but as a hobbyist I can try to share what I know.

Majority of the platinum mining happens in Africa (sth like 70% of viable deposits are there, 10% in Russia and 20% in Canada/US afaik). So that was what I was referring to on how the distribution is unorthodox. But the main problem with Platinum mining is that its' concentration. You would consider yourself lucky if you get 6gr of platinum ore from a metric ton of raw rock in a viable underground mine. In comparison from the gold mines of Sierra Nevada (which is a high concentration mine) you can get around 1 troy oz (about 30gr) gold per ton of rock.

The other difference is that gold ores are usually coupled with other high demand metals, such as copper/silver, so you can technically dual-mine (even triple in some locations), which draws down the cost significantly. This cannot be said at the same rate for palladium/platinum.

The final thing I can say is that, thousands of years of effort and research went into gold/silver/copper/iron mining, but the same was not true for platinum so sunk cost of operational improvements for platinum specific mining might still be high (I might be totally wrong on this, so take it with a grain of salt).";2;1;False;justinjustinian;ff3t2wy;Stock-to-flow is just the inverse of the inflation rate, nothing more;er81sh;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/er81sh/stocktoflow_is_just_the_inverse_of_the_inflation/

"Sure, but first let's talk about some basics.

For most\* commodities increasing the flow is a terrible business strategy if you do not have foresight of increased demand in stocking. This is because storing the goods without continuous demand increase is expensive; and the more valuable the commodity per fixed volume is, more expensive these get. For cheap commodities you only have to worry about storage facilities, corrosion protection and logistics. For more expensive ones security becomes polynomially more complicated as well as logistics tactics to move the goods. Think about copper wires lying around near your industrial zone vs the London/NY gold vaults, and how each goods are stored/moved to better visualize this.

In order for this trend to be broken you need the assurance that there would always be enough demand on the goods with a slight price decrease, minimizing the fluctuations, a.k.a. high liquidity&trading-volume. The easiest way to have this assurance is EITHER:

1. There is an established trade on this commodity as a 'medium-of-exchange' globally, OR
2. There is an ever increasing industrial use of the commodity.

\----

Sorry for long introduction. Let's come back to platinum. For the platinum, industrial uses exist but they are not necessarily booming with growth, since there are mostly cheaper alternatives that does the job decently well in most cases.

What about using it as a 'medium-of-exchange'? This has actually been tried by Spanish and Russians in 18th-19th centuries. In fact it was used as a day-to-day currency (a.k.a. RegularNationalCurrency) in Russia during this time frame. There were few problems on why it was not as popular though:

1. Platinum coins actually resemble a lot of other \`neutral-metal\` precious metals. To an uninformed eye (who is not a collector) they look just like other metals. You can see how this can become a problem for an RNC, especially if people use different ratios of cheaper metals to alloy it with (for most part color is what people tell these apart).
2. Platinum is neither ductile nor very malleable, and therefore much harder to work.
3. More of a political reason, but platinum mining was not as explored globally, making few countries around the world having overly powerful on the supply end, and they just were not the countries controlling the world at the time.

All in all platinum not being a universally accepted 'medium-of-exchange' prevented it being a 'store-of-value' as well. 

All of this leaves us to only limited demand for Platinum (industrial + limited-collector-demand). Now if you ramp up the production, with the demand fairly stable it would destroy the prices, making all the mining at those costs infeasible, so it finds the relatively balanced stock levels, which is about 1 years worth for logistical and trade reasons.

Currently there is a small stock and a small flow of platinum. It's only use is in the industry. If people started hoarding platinum to use it as a store of value many more people will mine it. Thus resulting in a crash in price. Small stock. High flow. Gold on the other hand has an enormous stock and people are constantly mining it.

"I think Bitcoin's proven exponential price growth will continue independently from the stock-to-flow metric. Besides, we've only had 2 or 3 previous halvings, based on which (n=2) you cannot predict anything.

My prediction, looking at the price chart from 2013-now, is that BTC is preparing for another ATH the coming 3-4 months, i.e., before the next halving. Because the price has got nothing to do with halvings, but with endogenic processes (popular belief, positive feedback loops).

"I have my doubts.  But one thing I thought of today was to use the congressman's need to raise [congressional dues](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7879613/AOC-holds-250K-dues-Democrats-says-wont-pay-people-like-not-welcome.html) to our favor.  My plan is basically to donate BTC to your congressman.  Works something like this.

1. Find your [congressman](https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative)
2. Ensure your registered to vote since congressmen will pay more attention to a registered voter than an unregistered voter.
3. Join the political party of your congressman.  You don't have to vote party ticket, but party rolls are public record.  Your congressman will pay more attention to a registered voter in their party than one in an opposing party.
4. Use google to find their campaign page, not their Congressional page.  The two are different.
5. Make a $10 donation through their campaign page and record all the answers you gave in the questionnaire.  Be truthful.  Donations are public record and a politician will pay a lot more attention to a donor than a non-donor.
6. Find the mailing address for correspondence off of the campaign web-page for the congressman.
7. [Make a paper wallet](https://github.com/pointbiz/bitaddress.org) depositing $10 in BTC to it.  Ensure you ***KEEP THE PRIVATE KEY***.
8. Write a letter to the congressman making ***NO*** political position, only requesting that they accept your small campaign contribution.  Include in your letter all the questions and answers you filed away in [5] as well as the paper wallet.  Provide some basic instructions for sweeping a paper wallet and mention that the wallet will be void after 12 months.
9. Use the congressman's House.gov website (not the campaign website) to request a meeting with the congressman or his staff.  Yes, they do this, its their job.  Tell them you would like to discuss ""Virtual Currency Tax Fairness Act of 2020"" sponsored by congresswoman Suzan DelBene of Washington's 1st District.
10. You will likely meet with a staff member, don't be offended.  Simply make your case to them and also provide your arguments in written form.  Some offices may require you transcribe the message onto their letterhead.  Don't be offended, just do it.
11. Check the address in the paper wallet every month or so to see if the funds have moved.  If they do move send a letter, tweet or call to the congressman's campaign thanking them for accepting your bitcoin donation.
12. If the funds don't move for 12 months, sweep them back to your wallet and send a letter, tweet, or call to the campaign informing them that the wallet had expired and offer to make them another.  They will decline.

Done.  You've done your bit and it only cost you $10 to $20 and a shit-ton of time.  The above really kinda works for any interaction you want to have with the government.  I've used it before and it helped quite a bit.

"> I only want to start small to begin with. start with a few bucks

If you are looking to Buy bitcoin with fiat money, then the methods available will differ based on a few factors:

- Where are you located (country)?
- How much are you looking to buy?
- What payment methods do you have available?
- How soon do you need access to the proceeds?
- Is financial privacy important?

You indicated that you are in Australia, and that the amount for your first purchase will be a small amount.

Here's a useful comparison of exchanges in which you can filter on payment method:

- https://exchangewar.info  <-- Filter box for currency (e.g., AUD) or payment method (e.g., VISA)

First time buyers may like the convenience of an online store that sells bitcoin and accepts debit and/or credit card. I do not know which ones require ID verification/KYC beyond those marked as such. (e.g., [Switchere](https://switchere.com) [**NO-KYC**], [Rebiton](https://rebiton.com) [**NO-KYC**], [Bitsell X](https://bitsellx.com) [[💳](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card)] [**NO-KYC**], [CoinCorner](https://coincorner.com) [[💳](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card)] [**NO-KYC** when £900 or less], [CEX.io](https://CEX.io.com), [Coinify](https://www.coinify.com), [Paybis](https://paybis.com), [Jubiter](https://app.jubiter.com/neworder/buy), [Bittylicious](https://bittylicious.com), [BitIreland](https://bitireland.ie), [Kuna.io Money](https://money.kuna.io), [LiteBit.eu](https://www.litebit.eu/en/buy), [Conio.com](https://conio.com) App, [CryptoVoucher.io](https://cryptovoucher.io), [GetSatoshi.org](https://getsatoshi.org) ([⚡](https://lightningnetworkstores.com/wallets)), [Cash App](https://cash.app/bitcoin) and CoinMama). You can buy BTC on Cash App without ID but you won't be able to withdraw them until you are KYC verified.

There are physical locations where there are Bitcoin ATMs and other vending/voucher methods.  For example, in Australia there is:

- https://coinatmradar.com  <-- Some will require Identity verification/KYC, others just a phone number (e.g., CoinFlip ATMs, when $900 or less), or nothing at all
- [Bitcoin Dealers](https://bitcoindealers.com.au/buy-bitcoins.html) (💵) Melbourne, Adelaide, & Sydney, Australia
- [Flexepin](https://www.flexepin.com/sales_outlet_finder) (Debit card or 💵) ([Coinloft](https://www.coinloft.com.au/buy/flexepin) & [Crypto Voucher](https://cryptovoucher.io/redeem-now))

"You probably misunderstand things, but anyway, current CoinJoins can only reduce the metadata around transactions, the number of preimages and signatures needed will still be the same, and it's the preimages and signatures which hold the bulk of the size of transactions.  Even if every block were one giant CoinJoin transaction (implausible, since it requires a large number of people cooperating and that none of them just suddenly abort the signing protocol for the lulz, or from sheer accidents like power or connectivity interruptions), there would still be *some* limit on how much data you can push through the blockchain.  That limit exists due to real-world limits on what actual commodity Internet connection and commodity hardware can process per unit time, and will not be changed easily, or at all, since most of the economically-significant majority will want to have easily-replaceable commodity hardware to run their fullnodes on.

(A proposed improvement called ""signature aggregation"" will allow CoinJoined transactions to have a single aggregated signature and thus allow the many signatures to be joined as well, but the other issues --- lots of preimages to push onchain, and the fact that a single loser can hold up the proper signing of the CoinJoin transaction for the lulz --- remain.  Also signature aggregation was deferred since it was not 100% certain it would be compatible with other, easier improvements that are already planned.)

The way to get high transaction throughput is to use offchain techniques where a group of people create a common fund on the blockchain that requires all participants to agree on how to spend it, and then use particular protocols to update a sense of the ""latest valid transaction"" that distributes that fund to the correct participants.  Those participants can then use various other protocols on top of such a mechanism to transfer funds across such mechanisms.  The Lightning Network is the foremost example of this kind of technique.";1;0;False;almkglor;ff30zft;A question about scaling, transaction costs and CoinJoin;er54o8;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/er54o8/a_question_about_scaling_transaction_costs_and/
"> The current block size has a capacity of ~500,000 transactions per day which we now meet, therefore the transaction fees have risen significantly

Your suggestion would make more sense if your facts were accurate. The daily transaction volume rarely exceeds 300k and most users can pay 1 Sat/vbyte fees for most transactions  

> kill the cap of 500k tx per day through CoinJoin

CoinJoin transactions are larger, so there would be fewer than 500k per day. This is a minor point  

Yes, using multi-user CoinJoin (or other multi-user technique like PSBT) for ordinary purchase transactions would work as a form of ad hoc P2P batching, and would increase throughput. It's not for everybody, because transactions are delayed waiting for all the input owners to sign the transaction

"I think the idea is to get a reduced transaction size through signature aggregation. Currently the biggest item in any single transaction is the signature at 65+ bytes. If we reduce to one signature per transaction, then we can potential fit many more in the same size transaction. There's still a need to include public keys though (33 bytes), which means that we'll only practically get an increase in throughput of maybe 2x-5x. Not the 1000x or more we need for global scale.

With signature aggregation, CoinJoin becomes more practical because it will become cheaper to join your coins than to transact alone.

There's limitations due to the interactive signing involved. All participants need to be online, which puts a practical limit on the number of people involved in a coinjoin. If a single participant goes offline, the signing process needs starting over.

Agreed... but its even worse than that.  Coinjoin won't reduce the amount of signatures, it will only reduce the amount of metadata.  So you wont get 2x... it will be more like 1.1x or 1.5x at best.

You have a very poor understanding of the history and properties of gold if you really believe this.

Gold was the only one available to the ancients. This is why it was ideal for jewelry and ornaments.

> 99% of golds value is derived from it's use as money and not because it's such an awesome metal.

How can you justify this claim? The entire reason gold became a store of value is due to its physical properties. Platinum is not traditionally a store of value, and it’s even MORE expensive than gold. It’s more rare than gold too, but by your logic it should be dirt cheap.

> if it was just about it being shiny there are far better metals to make jewelry out of

This is incorrect. There was no better metal available to the ancients.

There is no way to extricate gold’s intrinsic value from its value as money. Again, other metals that have similar properties to gold but are not traditionally used as a store of value (like platinum or rhodium) are even MORE expensive than gold today. This would not be the case if 99% of gold’s value was bootstrapped. These metals have intrinsic value just like gold.

"**Executive Order 6102**

Executive Order 6102 is a United States presidential executive order signed on April 5, 1933, by President Franklin D. Roosevelt ""forbidding the hoarding of gold coin, gold bullion, and gold certificates within the continental United States"".  The order was made under the authority of the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917, as amended by the Emergency Banking Act the previous month.

The limitation on gold ownership in the U.S. was repealed after President Gerald Ford signed a bill legalizing private ownership of gold coins, bars and certificates by an act of Congress codified in Pub.L. 93–373 which went into effect December 31, 1974.

"Bitcoin is a digital asset that is scarce.  There are ~18M bitcoins in existence today (though bitcoin is divisible, so there are actually 18M BTC X 100,000,000 ""sats"" per BTC, so there are actually 1,800,000,000,000,000 sats that exist today).  In ten years, there's another ~2.4M BTC issue, and for decades after that less than 1M BTC, until all 21M BTC have been issued.

So, those that hold bitcoin for investment are seeing how bitcoin is useful not just as a censorship-resistant payment method, but also as a store of value, ... one that is also interesting as a speculative instrument because if more and more people want to use bitcoin as a store of value, or payment method, etc., that with limited supply, that added demand means only one thing ...a  higher price.

So when you hold some bitcoin, you hold the private keys that give you the ability to spend that bitcoin.   There's no guarantee bitcoin will increase in price though.  The reason it is ~$8,800 today is because expectations of bitcoin being used more and more by others is already priced in, so if bitcoin were to fail to be used more and more in the future, ... the price could fall.

So those buying bitcoin today to hold are speculating that there's actually more growth in bitcoin usage than the market (today's speculators) believe will happen.";1;0;False;cointastical;ff2cg54;still wondering;er2hcm;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/er2hcm/still_wondering/
"If you are looking to Buy bitcoin with fiat money, then the methods available will differ based on a few factors:

- Where are you located (country)?
- How much are you looking to buy?
- What payment methods do you have available?
- How soon do you need access to the proceeds?
- Is financial privacy important?

First time buyers may like the convenience of an online store that sells bitcoin and accepts debit and/or credit card. I do not know which ones require ID verification/KYC beyond those marked as such. (e.g., [Switchere](https://switchere.com) [**NO-KYC**], [Rebiton](https://rebiton.com) [**NO-KYC**], [Bitsell X](https://bitsellx.com) [[💳](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card)] [**NO-KYC**], [CoinCorner](https://coincorner.com) [[💳](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card)] [**NO-KYC** when £900 or less], [CEX.io](https://CEX.io.com), [Coinify](https://www.coinify.com), [Paybis](https://paybis.com), [Jubiter](https://app.jubiter.com/neworder/buy), [Bittylicious](https://bittylicious.com), [BitIreland](https://bitireland.ie), [Kuna.io Money](https://money.kuna.io), [LiteBit.eu](https://www.litebit.eu/en/buy), [Conio.com](https://conio.com) App, [CryptoVoucher.io](https://cryptovoucher.io), [GetSatoshi.org](https://getsatoshi.org) ([⚡](https://lightningnetworkstores.com/wallets)), [Cash App](https://cash.app/bitcoin) and CoinMama). You can buy BTC on Cash App without ID but you won't be able to withdraw them until you are KYC verified.

Here's a useful comparison of exchanges in which you can filter on payment method:

- https://exchangewar.info  <-- Filter box for currency (e.g., EUR) or payment method (e.g., VISA)

There are physical locations where there are Bitcoin ATMs and other vending/voucher methods.  For example, in the U.S. there is:

- https://coinatmradar.com  <-- Some will require Identity verification/KYC, others just a phone number (e.g., CoinFlip ATMs, when $900 or less), or nothing at all
- https://www.coinstar.com/bitcoin (with [2,200+ locations in the U.S.](https://coinme.com/kiosks))  <-- Identity verification/KYC
- https://libertyx.com/a/buy/locations  <-- Cashier (cash), and/or Kiosk (debit card)
- https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/dabf2m  <-- Some will require identify verification/KYC, but not all will.

Otherwise, an in-person cash trade or an online trade using a P2P trading exchange may possibly be your next best option:

*P2P Trading exchanges*

- [Person-to-person (P2P) Trading Exchanges](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/dyclf8)
- https://exchangerates.pro  <-- Choose country and/or Payment Method

Using gift cards, there is [CardCoins](https://www.cardcoins.co) for paying with a non-reloadable, prepaid GIFT card (VISA/Mastercard/AMEX/Discover),  [CryptoVoucher.io](https://cryptovoucher.io) for paying with gift cards for numerous brands, [Redeem](https://www.redeeem.com/gift-cards), and [BitOf](https://bitof.io/) for paying with Amazon UK gift cards).

You can purchase online using a No-KYC online store, paying by depositing cash in a bank account or through Moneygram/Western Union:

- [BitQuick QuickBuy](https://www.bitquick.co/quick-buy) [**NO-KYC** (when trx amount is under $400)]

"If you are only looking for investment, rather than owning bitcoin itself, there are ways to ""invest"" (i.e, gain exposure to bitcoin exchange rate increase/decrease) without even touching bitcoin itself.  You can buy a bitcoin position on Robinhood (U.S., U.K.), or Revolut (UK, EU), or in your stock brokerage account (Stock symbol OTC:GBTC), etc.   

You can invest in bitcoin using a custodial bitcoin exchange, but that's historically been a risky practice with the obscene number of security incidents (e.g., exchange hacks).

scriptSig is replaced with scriptPubKey of the previous transaction as a placeholder, since you cannot sign the signature. You would have a chicken vs egg problem. You need to sign the transaction in order to have a signature to go in the scriptSig, and since the input itself is being signed you need to put something in the scriptSig’s place. I don’t know the exact reason *why* the scriptPubKey of the referenced output is used instead of leaving it empty, but it probably has to do with signature malleability for transactions with multiple inputs making it impossible to take the signature from one signed input and use it as the signature of another (within the same transaction).;3;0;False;Septem_151;ff1dgbx;How does HASHSIG work?;er2gpo;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/er2gpo/how_does_hashsig_work/

If an asset is going up in price, human behavior is to save (""hoard"" they call it) that asset, and spend using the currency that isn't going up in price (i.e., fiat currency).

"Another significant criteria item in choosing a wallet is Coin Control.

- https://medium.com/@nopara73/coin-control-is-must-learn-if-you-care-about-your-privacy-in-bitcoin-33b9a5f224a2

Coin Control is useful also should you need to do a child-pays-for-parent (CPFP) transaction.

There's also the fee bumping method known as child-pays-for-parent (CPFP). If you send a transaction and the fee was too low, you can spend the ""change"" transaction but double up the fee required. This will cause the miners to look at both transactions as a set, and the combined fees should then be high enough to get both confirmed.  CPFP also can be done if you are the recipient of the funds.

"If you are buying as an investment, what you could do is follow Dollar Cost Averaging. That's where you spread your buys over a certain period of time. e..g, 6 months, you buy $50 each month, to get you investing your target of $300 (for an example).

If the exchange rate goes down from here, great, your average price for your position will be less than ~$8.5K per BTC. If the exchange rate goes up from here, great, you got at least some at ~$8.5K per, which you wouldn't have gotten had you sat on the $300 for six months and bought all at once then.

There's still the risk of it going down after you purchase, but this strategy is one that works for many who struggle with FOMO or who stress over trying to time the market.

Does your bank work with Zelle?  Quite a few do.   Zelle is a pretty great, nearly instant, payment method.    It's a common method used with P2P trading exchanges, such as Bisq, Paxful and others.  It is not risk-free, as if someone pays you using a stolen bank account, you'll likely lose those funds.  But trade with someone who has a good trust history (i.e., many trades, great reputation / trade history) and you'll be fine.

- Is financial privacy important?

With P2P trading exchanges, some payment methods include buyer deposits cash in your bank account, or transfers the funds to your account.

"You know the saying""don't put all your eggs in one basket""?   Same goes for exchanges.

You can sell $5K worth of bitcoin, for example, by selling $1K via 5 different methods.   That way if there's a hold up with one, you still have the other four that did delivery, and you deal with the 5th.

Even on the same exchange you can do this.  For instance, if you have an exchange like Kraken, using the example above, you can deposit just 20% of the total amount of coin you wish to sell,  sell it, withdraw the fiat, then do the same thing for the next 20%, and so on until you have withdrawn the last of your coins.

"The way it is written, I read it as per transaction (non-cumulative). So yes, you could do many small transactions:

https://coincenter.org/files/2020-01/delben-049-xml-final.pdf

Edit: If the bill had some small yearly limit, or any yearly limit, for capital gains made from **daily expenditure-type transactions**, it would be a worthless bill, and people would just go back to not reporting anything like they do now with their purchases. The US Government needs to recognize that people do and will use this as a daily currency and that daily, non-massive transactions should be able to be spent without worrying about common fluctuations in price and without keeping a running tally of all capital gains throughout the year. The IRS also needs to recognize: People often LOSE money on the cryptocurrency price fluctuations during purchases. I have countless times. So it's a two-way street anyway.

The way the bill is written now, as I interpret it, is much better for US people and for the country. Think how much BS it will save the average tax payer AND the IRS.

If there is some yearly limit or cap that people have to keep a running tally of every time they buy a daily expenditure, then the whole bill is worthless garbage, and people won't follow it anyway.

Also: The US could learn a lot from other more innovative regulations from other countries. If they don't, they will get left behind.

Another thing too: As the price of cryptocurrency generally rises, it will stabilize, meaning the fluctuations and gains will become proportionally less and less severe.";1;0;False;333929;ff2e80n;U.

Depends on what you mean by ""over there"".  As others have said our Middle East involvement is largely for the petrodollar, which solidifies the US's status as the sole global superpower.  More broadly the idea of a large military is to serve as a deterrent - with such an overwhelming force, individual countries won't bother starting up all-out conflicts.  Proxy wars abound, but theoretically many direct conflicts have been prevented by the US's, and by extension NATO's, large military power.

UL, ASCE, ASME, NEC, IEEE, etc, etc. Literally any product you pick up, any building you walk in to, or any road you drive on has been regulated and governed by voluntary, non-profit, private code compliance standards and safety certification organizations. They literally run the world you live in with your complete ignorance of them. And it has absolutely nothing to do with “philanthropists” or the will or funding of any single individuals. They're all built on a common understanding of mutual goals for society.

Those ""agencies"" could *easily* be replaced by similar organizations and the world would be a better place because of it.

"All those engineering orgs are funded by engineers paying dues. They literally have a defined revenue stream to cover the administrative costs of running the board. Are you going to pay your CDC dues in the new stateless society? Do you think that ~44 million others will too? Because that’s roughly how many members it would take to cover the $11 billion annual budget at $245 per annual membership. And that doesn’t give us any emergency budget to fight epidemics. Can you imagine if IEEE sent out an email blast begging members for an extra $27,000 each (at 400,000 members) to hit their goal of $5.4 billion to help modernize the infrastructure of Syria with the hopes of reducing the long term spread of ISIS? I don’t really see how we can replace an organization whose purpose is R&D with no intention of monetizing discoveries with one of your example thin admin/licensing boards?

"Not directly but most places require paying capital gains on increases in asset value even if used as pmt for goods/services. So if you buy btc and it goes up then you need to report the gain even if spent for chocolate bars. In many cases the amounts are trivial and so the burden of accounting it is crazy. This bill tries to offset this by making gains below a threshold easier to handle. 

The problem I see is that they'll never want to allow gains in aggregate be non-taxable. So if you buy $100 btc and it increases to $10,000 but you spend it in small amounts over time on various items I doubt they want to let that overall capital gain of $9900 be untaxed yet a bill like this would do that if individual spends were small.

"This is a step in the right direction, but I believe it fails to address a few key issues with crypto tax law. The biggest issue as these laws stand currently is applying a capital gains tax to every crypto transaction, when these taxes should not apply to a currency, period. 

This stems from the lack of an authoritative definition of a cryptocurrency as a traditional currency in the eyes of the major legislative bodies. The second issue is a derivative of the first, in that the current laws unnecessarily complicate the tax filing process.

While the proposed bill does progress the movement by establishing the concept of cryptocurrency as a traditional currency (although on a conditional basis only), it fails to simplify the tax filing process within reach of the every day citizen.

If this bill were to pass, you would still need to pay CGT on any crypto transactions in which you ""profited"" more than $200. This means if you bought $1000 of bitcoin and sold it at a value of $1200 or more (even if just spending it), you'd pay CGT on the profit from that tx.

We need a bill that defines a cryptocurrency as a traditional currency. This would rely on legislation that separates cryptocurrencies from security tokens and other forms of blockchain based value-holding coins and tokens.

Furthermore, it would need to state that cryptocurrencies that fall within the requirements to be classified as a traditional currency must be taxed as such. Capital gains taxes would be due for profits made on transactions involving security tokens only.

This certainly wouldn't solve everything, but it's a big part of where we need to head from here. Getting bills like this one in front of Congress is an important start, even if they aren't perfect.

We just need to start the right commentary.

"Why should the government get to tax it at all?

I'm the one who takes full responsibility at the risk of owning and using it. That was especially true in the early days of Bitcoin when it was way more speculative.

If the dollar was backed by historically sound money like gold as it used to be, one could argue Bitcoin might not have been developed as soon as it was. The world wouldn't be consumed with insurmountable debt and out of control government monetary planning and spending that was a market incentive for Bitcoin to be created in the first place.

So basically, continually depreciating debt-based fiat currency is forced upon us, and because we choose what we find to be a better alternative to our needs, the government is still entitled to steal some of it from us. Sweet.

Do most people in this sub not realize Bitcoin was created to take power away from the state and their corporate wall street sponsors? The government would shut it down if they could. Taxing and putting antithetical KYC restrictions on Bitcoin to make it seemingly more difficult to use is the best they can do to slow down their inevitable demise.";3;0;False;MrDogeMeister;ff1oo6o;U.

"As I [mentioned](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/er0whr/u_s_congress_proposes_to_free_small/ff1fjw3/) to u/fresheneesz, I have my doubts.  But one thing I thought of today was to use the congressman's need to raise [congressional dues](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7879613/AOC-holds-250K-dues-Democrats-says-wont-pay-people-like-not-welcome.html) to our favor.  My plan is basically to donate BTC to your congressman.  Works something like this.

1. Find your [congressman](https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative)
2. Ensure your registered to vote since congressmen will pay more attention to a registered voter than an unregistered voter.
3. Join the political party of your congressman.  You don't have to vote party ticket, but party rolls are public record.  Your congressman will pay more attention to a registered voter in their party than one in an opposing party.
4. Use google to find their campaign page, not their Congressional page.  The two are different.
5. Make a $10 donation through their campaign page and record all the answers you gave in the questionnaire.  Be truthful.  Donations are public record and a politician will pay a lot more attention to a donor than a non-donor.
6. Find the mailing address for correspondence off of the campaign web-page for the congressman.
7. [Make a paper wallet](https://github.com/pointbiz/bitaddress.org) depositing $10 in BTC to it.  Ensure you ***KEEP THE PRIVATE KEY***.
8. Write a letter to the congressman making ***NO*** political position, only requesting that they accept your small campaign contribution.  Include in your letter all the questions and answers you filed away in [5] as well as the paper wallet.  Provide some basic instructions for sweeping a paper wallet and mention that the wallet will be void after 12 months.
9. Use the congressman's House.gov website (not the campaign website) to request a meeting with the congressman or his staff.  Yes, they do this, its their job.  Tell them you would like to discuss ""Virtual Currency Tax Fairness Act of 2020"" sponsored by congresswoman Suzan DelBene of Washington's 1st District.
10. You will likely meet with a staff member, don't be offended.  Simply make your case to them and also provide your arguments in written form.  Some offices may require you transcribe the message onto their letterhead.  Don't be offended, just do it.
11. Check the address in the paper wallet every month or so to see if the funds have moved.  If they do move send a letter, tweet or call to the congressman's campaign thanking them for accepting your bitcoin donation.
12. If the funds don't move for 12 months, sweep them back to your wallet and send a letter, tweet, or call to the campaign informing them that the wallet had expired and offer to make them another.  They will decline.

Done.  You've done your bit and it only cost you $10 to $20 and a shit-ton of time.  The above really kinda works for any interaction you want to have with the government.  I've used it before and it helped quite a bit.

Agree, it still sucks, but this is massively better and more significant. You can have much bigger transactions than $200 as long as profit was less than $200. It's a step in right direction. This would basically cover the vast majority of people's transactions. Even if you spent $400 on something, it would be ineligible for taxing unless the bitcoin you're spending had doubled in price since you bought it.;1;1;False;333929;ff26qlq;U. S.

"> Most of the powers that be still don't see bitcoin as a threat

Agreed.  I don't think they see it as a threat, they just don't see how they can profit from endorsing it.

> They think they can squash it whenever they want, and since it's not yet visibly affecting their bottom long, why worry? 

Honestly I don't think they care.  They have a vote to decide on.  One lobby group (JP Morgan, Wells Fargo, Apple) offer them $10,000 to vote against, and another party (Coinbase, SquareCash) offer them $0 to vote for it.  To me it's pretty obvious they will vote against.

> We've seen positive legislation around cryptocurrencies in the US before,

That's encouraging.  I haven't seen any positive legislation in this regard, so I must have missed it.

> A representative had to introduce this bill in the first place, so there's an least one vote for it on the table.

I think you’ve answered the question. When trading with 1,000 BTC do you feel like a whale or do you feel like a guy trading with 1,000 BTC? A 1,000 or 3,000 BTC order is nothing in most major exchanges. True whales coordinate with others and they set the price they want to see and then they drive the whole market to that price. Today’s price action is a perfect example of whales in action. The only way to benefit from this is if you buy and hold or if you’re ‘in’ and you know what’s going to happen ahead of time.;0;1;False;bjman22;ff1pel0;"What exactly is a ""whale""?";eqzhtw;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/eqzhtw/what_exactly_is_a_whale/

"Private Keys.

I'm no pro but I think I get the idea. Each address has a Public Key and a Private Key pair. Your public keys is well... public so you can share it (I think it's use to create your address). However, you should never share your private keys because they are needed to sign a tx. Basically, if you have the Private Key associated to a wallet, you have access to the coins.

"What you could do is follow Dollar Cost Averaging. That's where you spread your buys over a certain period of time. e..g, 6 months, you buy $50 each month, to get you investing your target of $300 (for an example).

If the exchange rate goes down from here, great, your average price for your position will be less than ~$8.5K per BTC. If the exchange rate goes up from here, great, you got at least some at ~$8.5K per, which you wouldn't have gotten had you sat on the $300 for six months and bought all at once then.

There's still the risk of it going down after you purchase, but this strategy is one that works for many who struggle with FOMO or who stress over trying to time the market.

"If you are looking to Buy bitcoin with fiat money, then the methods available will differ based on a few factors:

- Where are you located (country)?
- How much are you looking to buy?
- What payment methods do you have available?
- How soon do you need access to the proceeds?
- Is financial privacy important?

You indicated that you are in the U.K.

Here's a useful comparison of exchanges in which you can filter on payment method:

First time buyers may like the convenience of an online store that sells bitcoin and accepts debit and/or credit card. I do not know which ones require ID verification/KYC beyond those marked as such. (e.g., [Switchere](https://switchere.com) [**NO-KYC**], [Rebiton](https://rebiton.com) [**NO-KYC**], [Bitsell X](https://bitsellx.com) [[💳](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card)] [**NO-KYC**], [CoinCorner](https://coincorner.com) [[💳](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card)] [**NO-KYC** when £900 or less], [CEX.io](https://CEX.io.com), [Coinify](https://www.coinify.com), [Paybis](https://paybis.com), [Jubiter](https://app.jubiter.com/neworder/buy), [Bittylicious](https://bittylicious.com), [BitIreland](https://bitireland.ie), [Kuna.io Money](https://money.kuna.io), [LiteBit.eu](https://www.litebit.eu/en/buy), [Conio.com](https://conio.com) App, [CryptoVoucher.io](https://cryptovoucher.io), [GetSatoshi.org](https://getsatoshi.org) ([⚡](https://lightningnetworkstores.com/wallets)), [Cash App](https://cash.app/bitcoin) and CoinMama). You can buy BTC on Cash App without ID but you won't be able to withdraw them until you are KYC verified.

There are physical locations where there are Bitcoin ATMs and other vending/voucher methods.  For example, in the U.K. there is:

- https://coinatmradar.com  <-- Some will require Identity verification/KYC, others just a phone number (e.g., CoinFlip ATMs, when $900 or less), or nothing at all

- [FastBitcoins](https://fastbitcoins.com/#locations) (💵)
- https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/dabf2m  <-- Some will require identify verification/KYC, but not all will.

Otherwise, an in-person cash trade or an online trade using a P2P trading exchange may possibly be your next best option:

"Edit: yes, you would be able to recover your wallet in a different wallet software using the seed phrase, given that the wallet software is BIP39 compliant. You can see a list of compatible wallets [here](https://walletsrecovery.org).


Allow me to clarify some important terminology.


Wallet — a collection of private/public key pairs, either generated randomly or deterministically. Wallets will present the user with an unused address, that’s never been seen in a transaction before, each time they want to receive bitcoin. If used correctly, an address should never be used more than once (with the exception of donation addresses). Wallets have the ability to sign transactions with private keys  to spend bitcoin owned by the addresses.


Watch-Only Wallet — a collection of public keys, either generated randomly or deterministically. A watch-only wallet is exactly the same as a regular wallet, minus the private keys and thus lacks the ability to spend bitcoin owned by the addresses.


Paper Wallet — a single private/public key pair written on a piece of paper or other physical medium. Typically stored offline and never see the internet until imported/swept into wallet software to be spent.

Address — a script that is presented in a human-readable format so that it is easy to read and write. The script can contain a variety of data, but the most common forms contain the hash of a public key.";2;0;False;Septem_151;ff1sip0;Don't be like Peter, back up your wallets please.;eqy5fb;https://twitter.com/PeterSchiff/status/1218911797626847234

If you are using a wallet that supports [replace-by-fee](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Replace_by_fee) (RBF), and have it enabled before creating your send transaction, you can feel comfortable going on the lower-end of the transaction fee range. If the transaction doesn't confirm soon enough for you, you simply bump the fee using RBF.

*Wallets supporting RBF*

There's also the fee bumping method known as child-pays-for-parent (CPFP). If you send a transaction and the fee was too low, you can spend the ""change"" transaction but double up the fee required. This will cause the miners to look at both transactions as a set, and the combined fees should then be high enough to get both confirmed.  CPFP also can be done if you are the recipient of the funds.

Yes, the price has to go up after the halvening for miners to sell at a profit, which will further increase the price as activity spikes. Will it do that? Maybe. It doesn't have to. Whales could tank the price so hard that miners will be stuck at a huge loss for years or even permanently if it never recovers. That's what it all boils down to. Whales.

"World War II wasn't the cause of America's debt. Neither has Trump made it skyrocket. In 1972 U.S. National Debt was at  $427 billion. That was 34% of GDP. At that time America was still on the gold standard. This meant that all U.S. dollars were backed by a percentage of physical gold and couldn't be just be printed out of thin air.

In 1973 America dropped the gold standard and since then debt has skyrocketed. This is because the dollar is fiat (unbacked) cash that America just prints more of whenever it needs. This causes inflation and results in debt being unserviceable. The FED prints money to service its debt but reduces the value of the dollar every time it does, meaning that debt can never be repaid.

Right now, U.S. National Debt is at $23 trillion. That's 106% of GDP and most other Western countries ae in the same boat. 

Leaving the gold standard and printing cash for 47 years is the cause of the current economic disaster in the making. 

For now, Bitcoin is the best option to hedge against disaster as it is similar to the form of representative money that the dollar was before 1973. There is only so much and it gets scarcer.  However, I don't think Bitcoin or cryptocurrency will be around as long as people think.

Decentralized finance is presented as key to putting right everything wrong with the mainstream financial system. However, in just 10-years, we have got to a point where  39 individuals control 11.1% of the total supply of Bitcoin, 154 individuals control 40% of all Ethereum, and 128 people control 47% of all Litecoin. The list goes on for other cryptos.

In short, in just 10-years, decentralized crypto gave the world a new genus of 1%ers. This already results in claims of market manipulation via things like Tether printing. Then you have the ""I'm the real Bitcoin,"" circus of Bitcoin Cash, BSV, and other coin forks that try to cash in on the Bitcoin namesake—and let's face it, trick people into buying them coins when newbies come to buy Bitcoin. .

To the majority of consumer investors on the outside, this creates distrust in the crypto space. Then you have the fact that most average people in the U.S. have less than $2K in savings and can't afford to invest.  This is why all eyes are now on institutional investors.

As institutional investment takes off with halving, we'll start to see more severe shaking out of weak hands after all-time highs. Each time this happens, consumer investors will become more convinced that crypto is a Ponzi scheme or scam, or just too risky.

My guess is that a fatal blow will eventually be dealt to BTC at around the $125K mark. This is when a lot of consumer investors who bought a few coins between $1 and $500 will cash out enmass with ideas of moving funds into tangible assets like property and as a result, cross back over into the mainstream financial system.

I say this could be a fatal blow to BTC and other cryptos, as everyday people will see this as the final bursting of the bubble. At the same time, I'm also guessing that nation states will start bringing out centralized crypto equivalents of the same fiat cash we have now. Then we'll be back to the early days of ""but how can Bitcoin be worth anything if its not backed by anything or issued by the government like real crypto dollars?""

But that simply has no rational basis.  Let’s say you have $10K USD.  If you start buying BTC using DCA, then at the beginning you will have a portfolio that is mostly allocated in cash and the percentage that’s allocated to BTC will grow over time.  Say after some time you have 9K cash and 1K BTC equivalent.  The expected variance from here is simply a function of the covariance of USD and BTC.  This expected variance will change over time as the portfolio allocation changes, but over any time period you can get the total expected variance by taking the integral over the expected variance at each point.  So let’s say that this adds up to an average allocation over a 2 year period of 70% BTC / 30% cash.  You’re going to have the same expected variance if you just invested that 70/30 upfront, except that you’ll have lower returns because there is an upward trend in price.;1;1;False;CubsThisYear;ff1q4pg;If you bought 100$ every month since ATH you would still be profitable!;eqo4rn;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/eqo4rn/if_you_bought_100_every_month_since_ath_you_would/
IMO it's not about what's logically the right approach, it's about what people can handle emotionally.  If people take 10k and put it into BTC, then it drops to 5k, they panic.  But if they automatically throw $50 a week into BTC, they don't react so emotionally to changes in price.  Therefore, they tend to stay invested for a longer period of time.;1;0;False;753UDKM;ff22zbt;If you bought 100$ every month since ATH you would still be profitable!;eqo4rn;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/eqo4rn/if_you_bought_100_every_month_since_ath_you_would/
No, buying at one time is not the same as buying over time. It’s very simple to explain that, and you are working very hard to explain the opposite. If you pick the right time, a single purchase is good. If you pick the wrong time, a single purchase is bad.
