My theory is that either yours is set to US, or that it's not available in Canada or the UK yet for some sort of legal/technical/regulation reason, although legal and regulation reasons seem a bit strange to me considering recent pro-bitcoin statements from Bank of England and the Chancellor of the Exchequer (the bloke in government who's in charge of all economic and financial matters).

"Yes, torrents.
I suppose the pirated releases aren't generally considered secure by safety conscious cryptogeek standards, but it's WINDOWS we're talking about anyway.

There are MD5 hashes available for all the official DVD isos.
Microsoft doesn't publish these hashes, but someone has gone to the effort of verifying them against physical copies.  I suppose I just trust the consensus on this. 

I've never bothered to verify an MD5 against an operating system torrent.
If I ever did, it would probably be a high security system running something other than Windows.
