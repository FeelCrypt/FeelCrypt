"**20020801 Theory**

Ok so after some thinking I have a preety good idea about what 20020801 is.Here's how I got to my conclusion:

**What is 00212121?**

Ok so everybody should know the 00212121 clue by now,but what does it mean?

If you look at the context of the reply you will notice that OP replied to this comment :""I cant find 20020801 on paper. Maybe is a clue"" with 00212121.I believe that 00212121 can be written as a sum of binary numbers like this:00111111 + 00101010.If you take these numbers and you convert them from binary to text you will get ""?*"".

The way you can look at it is that the guy who made that comment forgot to put a question mark at the end of ""Maybe is a clue"" and OP simply replied ""?*""(you forgot the question mark).

**20020801,19981101,02003501**

Ok so because of that reply we can consider that 20020801 is also a sum of binary numbers after that rule.In this picture we can also find the number 19981101 in the bottom right AND if we take all the q values q=020,q=035,q=01 and we combine them we get a third number 02003501 also ending in 01.You might wonder why 02003501 and not 03502001,well that's because this way it matches the structure of the other numbers and in the picture there's a z=35 between q=020,q=01,suggesting 035 is in the middle.

So now let's break them into binary numbers ordering them like this:02003501,19981101,20020801:

01001101 01001100 00001100 00000100 00000100 

11111101 01110000 01110000 01110000 01110000 01110000 01110000 01110000 01100000	

10010101 10010100 00000100 00000100 00000100 00000100 00000100 00000100

What we have now are 22 binary numbers.

**Entropy values**

So at first i thought maybe these are steps to get the order of the words but after some experimenting i found something preety interesting.

If you look here: https://iancoleman.io/bip39/ you can generate bip39 seeds using entropy.Now,for entropy **we can use  binary numbers**.This is where the perspective changes.We no longer have 22*8 bit binary numbers,now we can look at it as 176 entropy bits.

With these numbers we can generate this 15 word mnemonic seed: *army cage dismiss thought alpha deal scrub asthma gauge protect absurd amount doctor acoustic bean*(with 3 words /32 bits)

**So what is this seed?**

So in my opinion this seed can be used for two things:

1)It's part of the consolation prize

OP mentioned there are some consolation prizes hidden in the puzzle,but I tried it with some common derivation paths and it didn't work.But maybe we also need to find out the derivation path?

2)It's an incomplete 24 word seed

So this seed might also be used for the word indexes.We might be able to pair the word indexes from this seed with words from the picture to find out the order of the 1 BTC seed.But,we only have 15 words so for this to be true it means some bits are still missing from the entropy and must be found in the picture.I got this idea from the ""code easily,attack early"" clue because I have a list of words that has code and attack in it but not easily and early which are paired with them,so it might be a start.

Oh and by the way the number 257 is a word index in the 15 word seed.

So this is preety much all I got this far.You can find my theory on the list of words in my other comment. Keep in mind that english is not my first language so I might sound weird in some places.
