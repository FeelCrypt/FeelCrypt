No, you're not. Neither are you when you are using bitcoin. The same reasoning is that I am a murderer because I have a gun. If I do not use my gun to murder, I am not a murderer. If I do not use my earned money to buy evil, I am not evil. Illicit organisations inherently use some monetary system, this does not make the system they use a system that is exclusively used for illicit purposes. Bitcoin has both advantages and disadvantages to use for illegal activities. So has USD, so have commodities like gold. If you use the monetary system implied by the country you live in, and that same country supports terrorism, and you do not agree with that, you can use your democratic vote to try and change that. You can renounce your citizenship, or you can ignore it, because you feel you are not capable of changing it anyway.

After first hearing of Bitcoin in 2008 how did you manage to miss all the news articles in the summer of 2011 and throughout 2013/2014 bubbles?

Please do. This is something I'd like to hear. I'd love to hear you explain why Bitcoin is a terrible idea because it is based out of an electronic.

>But this stuff has some really big potential with the globalization of networks and soon to be desparate need of concrete, decentralized information and education submitted

Why do you think there will soon be a desperate need for accurate, decentralized information? Care to expand on the use-cases to which you are referring? I believe what you are describing is being worked on but no implementation is practical for a number of reasons. I personally don't think these issues can be resolved.

>Pen and paper is millions of times more secure and stable than crypto currency can ever be as a currency, which is what I explain to people as I said before.

Care to explain this? Because so far it sounds like you don't know what cryptography is. Or counterfeiting. The simplest and most complete current use for Blockchain is as a currency and this has been proven for almost 10 years, now. Most other uses are better served by a traditional database. The use-case I understand you are thinking of is still best-served by Wikipedia. It's not perfect but there are a lot of unsolved issues trying to do the same thing using a blockchain.


After reading again and thinking more, I think I understand your position. I still don't understand why you think cryptocurrency is a bad idea and I'd love to hear that reasoning. But I also think I understand now that you are a Blockchain enthusiast and see other uses. I disagree that any are nearly as reliable as cryptocurrency but at the same time we need people to think differently and to explore different ways to use new technology.

"Meh. Nodes have the “power” of diverting from the main chain. Aka no power.

It’s proof of work, not proof of node validation. All the work is done by miners.

Or maybe being able to say “Ha! My node said your hardfork is invalid!” means something to you.... to each their own.

EDIT: 


His whole entire article is so damn silly. Look at this ball of fully validating nodes! They won't validate invalid blocks just because a miner mines them! The whole point he is missing is that in the event of a hardfork where the majority of hashrate agrees to make a change that would cause those nodes to mark blocks invalid and hence not relay them further is that those miners could give two shits if those nodes marked them invalid or didn't relay them. 

Even if the nodes are coinbase, gemini, bitmex, satoshi himself, and 99% of bitcoin nodes around the world, they don't give a shit. Reject all you want. All of those nodes combine for zero hashrate and wouldn't be able to mine one block in a million years. Guess what not mining a block means?!?! No transactions! So now they get to sit there and pay each other on the back for basically saying ""your blocks are invalid in our literally dead blockchain where there will never be a transaction again."" 

In the event of a hardfork where 75% of the hashrate created invalid blocks, you'd still have 25% of the hashrate and you'd get blocks every 40 minutes or so until the next difficulty adjustment. In this contentious hardfork scenario, the non mining nodes sort of kind of matter. They relay valid blocks from that 25% of hashrate. 

UASF didn't do a damn thing IMO. What prevented the contentious hardfork was the bull market and the future pricing of Bitcoin unlimited and bitcoin segwit 2x. Non mining nodes are essential to literally nothing. ";2;0;False;SnowBastardThrowaway;e8tg79r;10 years ago today... (2008 Oct. 31);9svjcp;https://i.redd.it/a7fykewk6gv11.png

"**ISO 8601**

ISO 8601 Data elements and interchange formats – Information interchange – Representation of dates and times is an international standard covering the exchange of date- and time-related data. It was issued by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and was first published in 1988. The purpose of this standard is to provide an unambiguous and well-defined method of representing dates and times, so as to avoid misinterpretation of numeric representations of dates and times, particularly when data are transferred between countries with different conventions for writing numeric dates and times.

In general, ISO 8601 applies to representations and formats of dates in the Gregorian (and potentially proleptic Gregorian) calendar, of times based on the 24-hour timekeeping system (with optional UTC offset), of time intervals, and combinations thereof.

For perspective:

*2008*: In September 2008, Lehman Brothers collapsed as the financial crisis spread. For the year, S&P 500 falls 38.49 percent, its worst yearly percentage loss.

*March 9, 2009*: S&P 500 closes at 676.53, its closing low after the onset of the 2008 financial crisis and the Lehman Brothers’ bankruptcy.

A potential game changer: ryptocurrencies are seen as bringing innovation to the payments-services sector; furthering financial inclusion; and facilitating greater efficiency in cross-border transactions.  Beyond Bitcoin, the wider adoption of cryptocurrencies is still in its infancy 

**I think a lot is here to stay but two things stand out:**

1. Facilitating greater efficiency in cross-border transactions; with the efficiency of block chain contractual and confirmation reliability  
2. ICOs: Companies have another decision to make when it comes to raising money.

The current financial system is structured like a water utility company but with the ability to gamble with global water supplies and profit regardless of the outcome.

It's not a perfect solution (yet), but bitcoin is the first viable alternative to that status quo which caused that total life collapse we all collectively experienced.

At the very least, a viable alternative presents the ability to negotiate for reforms without the risk of being laughed out the room. At the best, it presents a way out of this mess.

">Right. But that doesn’t make it legally prohibited as a currency. It makes it impractical as a currency. 

I don't put stock in intentions: it doesn't matter to me or the masses who never adopt bitcoin because of the massive ""impracticalities"", whether the government *intended* to hobble crypto or not. There is no qualitative difference between the government banning crypto outright, and making it impractical to use via what they think are benign taxes or money transmitter licensing...only a quantitative difference. They are making it de facto illegal to use, even if not de jure illegal.


>You did hit the nail on the head as to why though. All currencies carry transaction and regulatory costs. For fiat and government backed currencies, this administration and cost is absorbed by the treasury, and paid for out of taxes, or by private banks who are required to report on deposits and transactions, and cover their costs through fees or investing deposits. 
>
>Cryptocurrency has yet to develop this infrastructure. Until it does, it’s by its very nature a speculative investment. 

Crypto will never develop this ""infrastructure"" (unless one becomes a fiat currency of a state); it cannot externalize its administrative costs on taxpayers or through seigniorage...that's the whole point of cryptos like bitcoin or monero: to become non-state money.

>Hopefully this isn’t the case with cryptocurrency, although a lot of people lost their shirts recently because of the speculative nature. As a community, we need to be either better about self regulating, or expect to have regulation shoved down our throats.

"> And your solution is to simply have the government solve the problem through magic fairy dust? Rebuilding requires SUPPLIES AND LABOR.

First, no the government alleviates the effects of natural disaster through wide-reaching federal agencies that have the money, manpower, and authority to mobilize and transport the necessary people and materials to disaster areas. If we are talking magic fair dust, then perhaps ""free market!"" and ""supply and demand!"" should be the first thing we look at.

> Hurricane Katrina

I'm not sure you realize how poor of an example this is for your argument. Due to the flooding, large parts of the city were uninhabitable and it was **not** profitable to bring in supplies, so I'm not even sure why you would think outside sellers would send in goods via... row boat(?) when the cost of transportation far outweighed the possible profit (considering most people had literally nothing).

In addition, it is important to note that Hurricane Katrina occurred while the party of ""small government"" was in charge of the country. It is notable that natural disasters are less deadly and the after-effects less devastating when the Democratic party is in control. It is situations where FEMA is intentionally cut and made ineffective that disasters like this happens (see Puerto Rico).

> Government will not be able to do it all. Charities will not be able to do it all. Do you want more help or not?

Your argument is that businesses will bring in goods to sell because it is profitable. Can you please elaborate how any of this will be profitable when government is giving away all these supplies for free? Also, government is absolutely able to do it all by itself. The only reason it ever **can't** do it by itself is due to Republican (and libertarian) backed cutting of FEMA funding.

> So do I get 4x the water if I have my family with me? What if we all come in one at a time? Who's going to uphold your buying limit to make sure that ""everybody gets some?"" And even if are magically able to do do, the people who needed the water to stay alive got just as much as the person who's got cases of water already? And the store is somehow magically able to ration perfectly, even if that rich guy doesn't come and buy any water?

You're speaking as though these logistics have never been worked out before. How do you think rescue workers, whether for charity or for government, hand out supplies? How do you think it gets decided who gets what and how much? People spend years (and sometimes decades) studying to be able to handle situations like this. There is a reason FEMA and other organizations are supposed to be run by **experts** will expertise and experience in handling situations like this. This is also why the free market will never be able to fulfill the needs of disaster survivors and properly get needed supplies to where they are needed, because the free market has no need for those experts and logisticians.

More than that, you speak poorly of the current ways that disaster situations are handled but I do not think you have a clear grasp on the massive scale of logistics and planning required or how well relief organizations already perform. Issues like Puerto Rico and New Orleans are due to **cuts** in FEMA and other agencies because of people who *hold similar beliefs to yours*. And even if your view of the situation was correct, how in the world is making sure the rich are properly cared for first and then letting life-saving necessities trickle down to the poor whenever the free market is finally able to make it in time (and I think it is fair to say that the government with the full force of the coast guard can be faster) better?

"> You're completely ignoring the fact

I am pointing out the difference in priorities. Just because you *believe* your priority will excel to the point that it will meet everyone else's main priority doesn't change the fact that there are two clear, different priorities. And that is worth noting because if you are incorrect then libertarianism fails to meet the the main priority of the majority of people, and that is a problem.

> Do you want relief effects to have the power of the government and charities, or do you want them to have the power of government, charities, and the free market? 

This question is a red herring. You are simplifying the point so much and disregarding main issues at hand, mainly that there is a loss of life and health due to price gauging.

Moreso, this is incorrect. For your ideology to work, the government cannot bring in supplies for free because that increases the supply and lowers the demand. Lobertarians cannot control charity, so what you are arguing for is (to use your over-simplification) government and charities versus charities and free market. The government, of course, is a lot more unified and coordinated than a group of separate entities in the free market.

> People see that water is selling for $20/bottle and the area is flooded with water, quickly dropping the price back to normal. People who don't REALLY need the water pass at $20, because making ice cubes isn't a priority. The people who need something to drink actually have it on the shelf, and are happy to pay $20 for it. 

This is what you hope, but there are some key issues here. First, no one is happy to pay 1000% for a water bottle when they are in a life-or-death situation. Second, no one doesn't *need* water, it is a necessity for life and in crisis situations running water can be disabled, clean drinking water polluted by flooding or chemical runoff, or entire homes can be destroyed. Third, you are assuming that roads are fully operational to get supplies in, which is often not the case. You ignored my point several comments back about how it becomes unprofitable to move in necessities like water if roads are damaged beyond use, but that is an important consideration because if no one is bringing in new supplies your entire argument falls absolutely and completely apart (regardless of the major holes in it already). Fourth, private entities are focused on maximizing profit rather than getting the water to the people who need it the most. Since your system requires there to be minimal to no government intervention, there is no single group with the goal and resources to help those in the most need.


> In your scenario, whoever gets to the store first is going to get all the water, regardless of who needs it most. Since it can't be sold at more than $2, no more arrives unless it's via government or charity.

In my scenario there was an excess of water supplies. The amount of water an individual could purchase was limited to ensure everyone got some. The people who show up first got the same amount of water as everyone else, because the store intentionally limited the amount they gave out to force that situation. This is actually how supplies are passed out in crisis situations, so this is not some radical expectation.

> By the way, thought experiments should have some sort of logic behind them and not just be numbers pulled out of thin air.

I used a simple though experiment because we seem to be simplifying this argument well enough already. If we want to make this more complex, then we will also have to revisit your supply-demand argument to see the realities in a crisis situation (e.g. logistics, range of disaster, real world examples, etc.). As it stands, that seems unnecessary.

I think it is also important to point out that you ignored or missed a critical point against your ideology that I wrote above. This point is important because it directly contradicts your goal of restoring equilibrium as quickly as possible:

> Using the same logic that’s been used up to this point, the “increased demand” will bring in investors who are eager to cash in on the disaster and charge higher rates for basic necessities.

> So the economic institutions being established (although most likely these “investors” are only interested in short-term as a long-term investment in the area would not be profitable due to the reduced population) are going to be from outside the community. These new institutions are going to take the wealth from the already damaged community and move it to other regions that haven’t been damaged by a disaster (they haven’t been damaged because they have the surplus), leaving long-term damage on the financial health of the community.";1;1;False;treesfallingforest;e8rt18h;Ron Paul Calls for Exempting Cryptocurrencies from Capital Gains Tax;9slssr;https://blockmanity.com/news/ron-paul-calls-for-exempting-cryptocurrencies-from-capital-gains-tax/

"> I'm not misunderstanding, this is exactly what I said. You and other libertarians are prioritizing what you consider ""rebuilding"" whereas most people prioritize getting the necessities to affected individuals first (i.e. food, water, shelter). You are saying your main priority will help the priorities of others (which is obviously quite debatable, especially given everything I have written), but the fact of the matter is that the former is always going to trump the latter in your ideology. I personally, and many others, consider this belief that economic freedom outweighs life to be nonsensical (at the very least)

You're completely ignoring the fact that the way that we help people is flooding the affected area with supplies. We incentivize people to bring in more supplies than normal by offering to pay more for them, just like we pay more for Uber rides on a holiday.

>This goes back to what I said several comments back. These aren't the only two options. Businesses can restrict how much individuals can purchase in a crisis situation or the government can supply more necessities to increase the supply, paid for by taxes. This isn't a 2-choice situation.

It's a really really simple question:

Do you want relief effects to have the power of the government and charities, or do you want them to have the power of government, charities, and the free market? 

If you restrict the market from doing its thing, you are simply going to funnel everybody into the government system, which then gets overrun because it only has the capabilities of helping the very worst off. 

>To drive this point home, let's do a thought experiment. A store has 400 water bottles normally priced at $2/bottle. In your price gouging situation, those 400 bottles are now priced at $20/bottle. Let's say we have two groups of people (poor and rich): the 20 poor who on average have $30 to their name and the 20 rich who on average have $300 to their name. In your price-gauging world, maybe about 5 poor people spent almost everything they had on a single bottle of water and 20 rich people ended up with 15 bottles each. 15 poor people ended up with nothing and now they will suffer. Now let's imagine a real world scenario where price gouging is illegal but the business limits their transactions to a max of 5 bottles per person. Now in this real world scenario 40 people bought 5 bottles each, so 200 bottles are sold (so 100 to spare if they are needed) and the poor people have $20 left. No one is going to suffer from life-threatening dehydration and there isn't a price barrier to basic necessities needed for life. This is how your priorities end up negatively impacting people.

And you ignore what actually happens: People see that water is selling for $20/bottle and the area is flooded with water, quickly dropping the price back to normal. People who don't REALLY need the water pass at $20, because making ice cubes isn't a priority. The people who need something to drink actually have it on the shelf, and are happy to pay $20 for it. 

In your scenario, whoever gets to the store first is going to get all the water, regardless of who needs it most. Since it can't be sold at more than $2, no more arrives unless it's via government or charity.

"> When I say market equilibrium, I'm referring to the time after the disaster has passed, prices are back to normal and life resumes. We want to get there as quickly as possible.

I'm not misunderstanding, this is exactly what I said. You and other libertarians are prioritizing what you consider ""rebuilding"" whereas most people prioritize getting the necessities to affected individuals first (i.e. food, water, shelter). You are saying your main priority will help the priorities of others (which is obviously quite debatable, especially given everything I have written), but the fact of the matter is that the former is always going to trump the latter in your ideology. I personally, and many others, consider this belief that economic freedom outweighs life to be nonsensical (at the very least).

> They run out a lot faster if they are not able to adjust their prices to signal that shortages are imminent, say via anti-price gouging laws.

This goes back to what I said several comments back. These aren't the only two options. Businesses can restrict how much individuals can purchase in a crisis situation or the government can supply more necessities to increase the supply, paid for by taxes. This isn't a 2-choice situation.

To drive this point home, let's do a thought experiment. A store has 400 water bottles normally priced at $2/bottle. In your price gouging situation, those 400 bottles are now priced at $20/bottle. Let's say we have two groups of people (poor and rich): the 20 poor who on average have $30 to their name and the 20 rich who on average have $300 to their name. In your price-gauging world, maybe about 5 poor people spent almost everything they had on a single bottle of water and 20 rich people ended up with 15 bottles each. 15 poor people ended up with nothing and now they will suffer. Now let's imagine a real world scenario where price gouging is illegal but the business limits their transactions to a max of 5 bottles per person. Now in this real world scenario 40 people bought 5 bottles each, so 200 bottles are sold (so 100 to spare if they are needed) and the poor people have $20 left. No one is going to suffer from life-threatening dehydration and there isn't a price barrier to basic necessities needed for life. This is how your priorities end up negatively impacting people.";1;1;False;treesfallingforest;e8rm2k5;Ron Paul Calls for Exempting Cryptocurrencies from Capital Gains Tax;9slssr;https://blockmanity.com/news/ron-paul-calls-for-exempting-cryptocurrencies-from-capital-gains-tax/

"> That seems like a rather nonsensical goal considering most people’s first concern would be to help as many people who are in immediate strife as possible and get them the bare necessities, screw economics if it gets in the way. But okay, if you want to use the restoration of economic institutions as the primary goal after a disaster then we shall discuss that, but keep in mind this is more the libertarian goal than the general populace’s goal.

You're not understanding. When I say market equilibrium, I'm referring to the time after the disaster has passed, prices are back to normal and life resumes. We want to get there as quickly as possible. You're reading meanings into words that don't exist and then arguing against them.

>Add onto than though, the local merchants and vendors that were previously selling goods and necessities have long since run out. Being on the front-line, the money they made from price-gouging is less than that of the vendors that will later come from beyond the community, as the demand was less. 

They run out a lot faster if they are not able to adjust their prices to signal that shortages are imminent, say via anti-price gouging laws.

>Add even onto that that any profit they made won’t be able to outright pay for damages to their businesses and the financial damage due to the disaster and the economic vultures (if you will) will cause a long-lasting drain on their profit margins.

This doesn't have anything to do with the prices they sell their products at, except for if they could raise the prices they would be more likely to both have supplies in the first place, and be willing to stay at work to sell them. The storm is going to cause damages either way. You're only handcuffing the rebuilding by mandating they can only be open if they can sell things for normal prices.

But okay, if you want to use the restoration of economic institutions as the primary goal after a disaster then we shall discuss that, but keep in mind this is more the *libertarian* goal than the *general populace’s goal*.

If that’s the goal, then how is price gouging going to restore economic institutions faster than not price gouging? Using the same logic that’s been used up to this point, the “increased demand” will bring in investors who are eager to cash in on the disaster and charge higher rates for basic necessities.

So the economic institutions being established (although most likely these “investors” are only interested in short-term as a long-term investment in the area would not be profitable due to the reduced population) are going to be from outside the community. These new institutions are going to take the wealth from the already damaged community and move it to other regions that *haven’t* been damaged by a disaster (they haven’t been damaged because they have the surplus), leaving long-term damage on the financial health of the community.

Add onto than though, the local merchants and vendors that were previously selling goods and necessities have long since run out. Being on the front-line, the money they made from price-gouging is less than that of the vendors that will later come from beyond the community, as the demand was less. Add even onto that that any profit they made won’t be able to outright pay for damages to their businesses and the financial damage due to the disaster and the economic vultures (if you will) will cause a long-lasting drain on their profit margins. The financial damage to the community is two-fold.

Now on top of everything, this is just the libertarian support for price-gouging. Combine this with their unwillingness to tax to support federal agencies that help *rebuild* communities, covering costs from damage and the costs of rebuilding. A lot of insurance companies have Act of God clauses that will get them out of paying for such insane level of damages, so this belief just further ruins the community.

"That's a good question.  The real answer is no one knows for sure which I'll explain.

The ""market"" decides the price based on services rendered.  Think about all of the things police (are supposed to) provide.  In reality, police have discretion to actually follow through with their enforcement.  E.g. police giving warning instead of ticket - or not charging fellow officer with crime.  The amount of time spent investigating charges would vary greatly. Police currently may or may not spend the zealous time they need to solve crime.  Prosecutors also have discretion on which crimes they'll prosecute.  I'd say those security packages would likely be bundled, probably on what you're willing to pay.  Yes, the wealthy would be greater served just like they always will. 

Looking at police with this kind of paradigm shift would totally change what kind of laws would be enforced.  Weed, other drug crimes and warrant searches wouldn't be fought on the highways.  Roadway rules would be served by private security staffed by high schoolers, because honestly enforcing road rules doesn't require armed, trained career folk to make sure people use their turn signals.  

Police currently contract out certain actions like serving papers or searching for fugitives.  Certain jobs would likely be contracted out.  Prices would also likely take into account risk assessments much like insurance companies currently do.  Age, area, disabilities, and education would be big factors.  As is currently, certain regions or cities account for more crimes than others.  In my state most violent crime occurs in two specific suburbs. It would probably cost more for security in that part of town.  In another part of my state has one of the lowest crime rates in the country.  Security would cost much less.  This isn't much different than those police departments are currently funded.  The prime difference is how it's allocated and collected. 

Also, depending on the business and socioeconomic status of regions, security would be applied much differently than others.  https://youtu.be/r2IbjhV00as that's a more exciting example of how crime can be deterred in certain neighborhoods using clever tactics.";1;0;False;fpssledge;e8ru1qp;Ron Paul Calls for Exempting Cryptocurrencies from Capital Gains Tax;9slssr;https://blockmanity.com/news/ron-paul-calls-for-exempting-cryptocurrencies-from-capital-gains-tax/

"> I am pointing out the difference in priorities. Just because you believe your priority will excel to the point that it will meet everyone else's main priority doesn't change the fact that there are two clear, different priorities. And that is worth noting because if you are incorrect then libertarianism fails to meet the the main priority of the majority of people, and that is a problem.

And your solution is to simply have the government solve the problem through magic fairy dust? Rebuilding requires SUPPLIES AND LABOR. Artificially restricting both because of feel-good policies end up extending the disaster and ensure that everybody is filtered through the government system.

What do you think the government can possibly provide that the free market cannot? 

[Do you think the free market turns trucks full of supplies around in the middle of a disaster?](https://www.cato.org/blog/hurricane-katrina-remembering-federal-failures)

>Some emergency supplies were prepositioned before the storm, but there was nowhere near enough. In places that desperately needed help, such as the New Orleans Superdome, it took days to deliver medical supplies. FEMA also wasted huge amounts of supplies. It delivered millions of pounds of ice to holding centers in cities far away from the Gulf Coast. FEMA sent truckers carrying ice on wild goose chases across the country. Two years after the storm, the agency ended up throwing out $100 million of unused ice. FEMA also paid for 25,000 mobile homes costing $900 million, but they went virtually unused because of FEMA’s own regulations that such homes cannot be used on flood plains, which is where most Katrina victims lived.

This is what you want to subject everybody to. Wait for government to come and fix it. Days or weeks if that's what it takes. 

>This question is a red herring. You are simplifying the point so much and disregarding main issues at hand, mainly that there is a loss of life and health due to price gauging.

>Moreso, this is incorrect. For your ideology to work, the government cannot bring in supplies for free because that increases the supply and lowers the demand. Lobertarians cannot control charity, so what you are arguing for is (to use your over-simplification) government and charities versus charities and free market. The government, of course, is a lot more unified and coordinated than a group of separate entities in the free market.

You are nearly insane if you think that government bringing in supplies somehow hurts our argument. WE WANT THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF SUPPLIES. Government will not be able to do it all. Charities will not be able to do it all. Do you want more help or not? 

>In my scenario there was an excess of water supplies. The amount of water an individual could purchase was limited to ensure everyone got some. The people who show up first got the same amount of water as everyone else, because the store intentionally limited the amount they gave out to force that situation. This is actually how supplies are passed out in crisis situations, so this is not some radical expectation.

So do I get 4x the water if I have my family with me? What if we all come in one at a time? Who's going to uphold your buying limit to make sure that ""everybody gets some?"" And even if are magically able to do do, the people who needed the water to stay alive got just as much as the person who's got cases of water already? And the store is somehow magically able to ration perfectly, even if that rich guy doesn't come and buy any water? This is why your scenarios need to make sense. You're just asserting things as fact and then passing them off as if you have a point. 

And of course your limit doesn't change anything AFTER the disaster hits and it costs more to get goods into the area. Once the store is out of stuff it will just sit empty since it's impossible to turn a profit by serving the community.

Most people in developed nations are hard pressed to adopt crypto at all...let alone when they find out how thoroughly they'd have to complexify their lives and taxes. And they are not going to break the law for crypto.

"Thank you got your more detailed response!

I think Somalia is an example of unintended application of some (what would be called) libertarian values. That's not an attack on libertarianism, but I think rather a reminder that any political system can easily result in major issues if applied improperly or incompletely.

I personally would argue that government monopolies *can* be fine, but that capitalist monopolies are always bad. I think what determines the value of a monopoly is its intended goal. Government monopolies have varied goals, but generally they revolve around the continued success of either the government or the country, which generally leads to prosperity for the people in one way or another. Capitalist monopolies have the intended goal of making profit and retaining their economic dominance, both of which are at odds with the ""out"" group (versus the ""in"" group who are members or parts of that monopoly).

I disagree with the notion that you can ever *choose* to not participate in any monopoly. That isn't really how it works in the capitalist world and I fail to see how that would ever benefit society as a whole when it comes to governments. Perhaps the *individual* can benefit, but corporations have a lot more strength and power to take advantage of such powers which quickly nullify and reverse any benefits achieved by the individual.

The current setup for environmental issues pits corporations against government institutions, with the latter having an advantage because they control both the regulation making and the regulation monitoring (to a certain degree). For your point (A), it cannot possibly be as effective because the situation would be reversed with corporations having the advantage because they start out with the rights and their opposition would be private citizens who would, for 99%+ of situations, have less power than the corporations. Consider a case just recently when [a cigarette company sued an entire country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Morris_v._Uruguay), and then consider that private citizens would have to try to compete with that in court. Even if the current system is imperfect (which is certainly is, I'm not opposed to fixing it or making it better), the problem *doesn't* line in corporations not having enough power.

> It's logically dishonest to compare western govt in its idealist form with the highest critiques of libertarianism. 

To this last point, it isn't really right to accuse either side of being dishonest. Personally I think that libertarianism fails to address solutions for many problems that government does and currently provides solutions for, instead opting to hand-wave those issues by saying the free market will account for it. That takes a lot of faith in the free-market when some of the issues that *we have seen* first-hand did not result in the outcomes many libertarians claim we can be sure of if we dismantled the government.";1;1;False;treesfallingforest;e8rtzj1;Ron Paul Calls for Exempting Cryptocurrencies from Capital Gains Tax;9slssr;https://blockmanity.com/news/ron-paul-calls-for-exempting-cryptocurrencies-from-capital-gains-tax/

For instance, all food is the transformation of solar energy. The sun is responsible for the energy put into corn and sugar, and is just as responsible for the energy put into cows and people. Each step in the food network is another useful transformation of solar energy.

"Libertarianism does...some of what you're saying probably depending on what you think libertarianism actually is.  I think there's a sufficient amount discrediting somalia as an example and I think you've sufficiently observed as much. 

As for the claim against monopolies...you should know that a very basic claim libertarianism makes is that govt *is* a monopoly. The solution is allowing competition. Not forcing participation. The way people are forced to any rule that democracy (or republic) decides.  Think, exitarianism.  Which is what some libertarians support and really nothing more.  Also recognizes that monopolies are not as evil as claimed.  Nothing forced us into paying for comcast or using facebook/YouTube other than perhaps social pressure or self imposed desires.  These problems are usually temporary anyway.  Is this an acceptable solution?  It's a paradigm shift.  Libertarianism doesn't directly solve this market problem.  

Environmental issues or disregard for public safety are either: a) still combated through court and retroactive enforcement which is at least as good/better as govt courts offer today and b) still imperfect and unpreventable by govt today, in which I'd refer back to point A.

For your other mentions, there isn't too much specific.  But something most libertarians have grappled with is the reality that govt *introduces* problems not accounted for in the absence or decrease of govt.  It's logically dishonest to compare western govt in its idealist form with the highest critiques of libertarianism.

Giving loans goes against the purpose of capitalism, which is to effectively designate the means of production to those who will produce best for the public. The best producers are the successful ones, and the successful ones have a surplus of saved value (capital). Why would we hand production over to people who are so unsuccessful that they don’t have the money upfront to produce?

">All money is is a representation of expelled energy/work.

Why does the guy digging ditches all day make less money in a week than a lawyer makes in an hour despite expending much more energy? Why does that same lawyer make less money in a week than the capitalist does in the time it takes them to finish their glass of wine?

Presumably the guy digging ditches is doing so because someone else wants those ditches dug. But what if there were no one who wanted the ditches dug, and the guy was just digging random ditches for no reason other than to keep busy? Would that energy spent be creating value? Why can't someone simply make a living by digging ditches in random places all day, or by simply opening and closing a random door repeatedly, or lifting and dropping a rock over and over? Could a country like North Korea run their economy by simply getting all of its citizens to do nothing but jumping jacks all day?

Energy spent, in itself, doesn't create value. It only has value if someone has a need for that energy spent. If someone needs those ditches dug, then the process of digging them has value.

Value comes from demand. If people want something, then it has value.";0;0;False;Ilogy;e8s0c7u;Ron Paul Calls for Exempting Cryptocurrencies from Capital Gains Tax;9slssr;https://blockmanity.com/news/ron-paul-calls-for-exempting-cryptocurrencies-from-capital-gains-tax/

"> The free market is survival of the fittest

no it's not. The free market's goal is to best combine capital and labour to maximise utility. 

In your definition of free market, the richest guy is always the fittest. Even if that person was born in money. Meanwhile you have so many billionaires who came from poor backgrounds. They needed capital. Most didn't make it due to making enough profits to not need a loan.

I repeat again, economics is not a place for ideological thinking.

>I’m not sure what you mean about the bread, I don’t eat my bread before I bake it, but I do have the flour. Giving loans to a business is akin to giving them flour to bake before they’ve proven their recipes are what people want

first of all, I do not know how you think loans are given. It's hard to find someone receive a loan from a bank without them providing a rational way to pay it back. Secondly, how exactly will you prove your recipe is good when you do not have the flour to bake it? There is a compromise to be made for the market to be efficient. Also, having a successful small business doesn't mean you could turn it into a successful big business. Every business year is a new one and past glories do not prevent you from failing. 

>And, as a secondary, these businesses go about trying to sell their unproven wares by enticing the public with advertising, which is a nuisance to perception, hindering the natural psychological progress of the public, and uses manipulation to artificially raise the value of otherwise valueless products. Again, it’s all very wasteful.

marketing is in itself an admission of failure. It means your product needs PR to sell itself. So I do not understand how you find value in marketing to the point that you want to avoid waste in it. 

>And, as a secondary, these businesses go about trying to sell their unproven wares by enticing the public 

every business at the beginning was selling unproven products. You are the physical form of asking for years of experience for an entry job. Dell became a billionaire by selling unproven products at the beginning. He got a loan that helped him start his Dell company and he grew it so fast.

"Right. But that doesn’t make it legally prohibited as a currency. It makes it impractical as a currency. 

You did hit the nail on the head as to why though. All currencies carry transaction and regulatory costs. For fiat and government backed currencies, this administration and cost is absorbed by the treasury, and paid for out of taxes, or by private banks who are required to report on deposits and transactions, and cover their costs through fees or investing deposits. 

Cryptocurrency has yet to develop this infrastructure. Until it does, it’s by its very nature a speculative investment. 

As a side note, it’s actually been fascinating to watch cryptocurrencies go through the same scandals, scams and sticking points as physical currencies/traditional investments have gone through, but at the speed of technology. I’ve seen very little that’s “new” to cryptocurrency besides it’s form. We’ve had merchant banks and corporate scripts and private currencies before. They just tend to get regulated out of existence when forgery, pump and dumps, and redemption blocking threatens to wipe out the wealth of a large section of the populace, and the government steps in to save them and prevent it from happening again. 

Hopefully this isn’t the case with cryptocurrency, although a lot of people lost their shirts recently because of the speculative nature. As a community, we need to be either better about self regulating, or expect to have regulation shoved down our throats.

"**Philip Morris v. Uruguay**

The Philip Morris v. Uruguay case  (Spanish: Caso Philip Morris contra Uruguay) started on 19 February 2010, when the multinational tobacco company Philip Morris International filed a complaint against Uruguay. 

The company complains that Uruguay's anti-smoking legislation devalues its cigarette trademarks and investments in the country and is suing Uruguay for compensation under the bilateral investment treaty between Switzerland and Uruguay. (Philip Morris is headquartered in Lausanne.)The treaty provides that disputes are settled by binding arbitration before the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID).Uruguay had received accolades from the World Health Organization and from anti-smoking activists for its anti-smoking campaign.On 8 July 2016, after 6 years, the ICSID ruled in favor of Uruguay, forcing the demandant to pay the expenses of the defendants and the court.
