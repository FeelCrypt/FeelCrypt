"It's a ""reasonably foreseeable act."" Heroin is illegal ostensibly because it's ridiculously easy to become addicted and kill yourself overdosing. Anyone supplying heroin knows this. One cannot sign away their rights to kill themselves. If I sign a waiver releasing the guy who owns the rock-climbing wall from any culpability if I injure myself, that doesn't matter IF HE KNEW THE WALL WAS STRUCTURALLY UNSAFE AND UNFIT FOR USE. Similarly, you are responsible for what your illegal drugs cause if it was something easily foreseeable.

He basically got caught in a trap where he put servers outside the country but did not realize that in order to assert his rights he would have to acknowledge he had a proprietary interest in them.

He was running a criminal enterprise and was an idiot, and didn't understand how US law works.

>We know the prosecutions side is filled with holes, but it's hard to determine which is BS and which is real for many of the points.

There are no holes.

There has been obfuscation by people with an agenda because 1) there was a secondary investigation by other agents and another department who have since been indicted, and 2) the source of identifying the servers is possibly the NSA and the result of parallel construction. However, parallel construction is not in and of itself a violation of due process, because what the NSA did, it did internationally to an entity not protected under US law, and then it gave the information to the FBI.

They used the fact that he didn't even CONTEST that he had done them, and in fact said that the evidence was him ""roleplaying"" (basically admitting he did it) to shape the sentences for the other crimes. He will be tried for the murders in Baltimore; it's already under way.

How hard is this to understand? He as much as admitted that he had them attempt-murdered, he wasn't sentenced for having done so yet, it was just a consideration when sentencing his other crimes. It painted a much more clear picture of how pathological he was: he was willing to kill innocent ROOMMATES of people that blackmailed him for no reason.

I don't see any other developments that would prevent history from repeating itself. Therefore I deem it likely that war is coming unless something unexpected halts that progression.

Then you should be able to paraphrase in a couple sentences exactly what the major objections are.

>I'm not going to bother explaining it a hwole lot, because based off your attitude, it seems like you're more concerned with arguing semantics and tiny irrelivant details, than the actual subject.

Actually, I presented two of the common challenges to the case and explained why they were unfounded.

What's far more likely is you can't substantiate your claims and so are therefore choosing to ignore my questions and hand wave your way out of a meaningful discussion while calling the teapot black.

>But I'm not going to bother.

You're repeating a meaningless statement. I find this happens when people can't address the point at hand.

>Anyone that's followed this case, especially people familiar with law,

I've followed the case, and pretty much all of my lawyer friends agree that it was a slam dunk and they have no idea what the hell Ulbricht's defense team was thinking.

>will say either ""This was extremely unfair"" or ""Drug dealers are routinely treated unfairly"".

Well, the difference between the two is light years and usually also involves a different meaning of unfairly. For example, the claim Ulbricht was treated unfairly, or even that drug dealers are treated unfairly by the courts, is very different than the idea that our drug laws are unfair to drug dealers.

You need to articulate specific due process violations which applied to him, or which are frequent in drug cases, and I don't think you or the documentary can do that.

>We have instances of relevant information being excused from the court, defense prevented from bringing in relevant expert witnesses, being gagged about certain relevant aspects to the case, and so on... It really does go on.

You need to articulate exactly which orders you believe to be unfair or wrong.

Here is the docket:
https://www.unitedstatescourts.org/federal/nysd/422824/

We can discuss which Judges orders you and others find to be legally incorrect. I can't know what's in your mind, but I've read all of it and I don't see anything glaring or significant.

>The problem is, all this suppression, prevents the whole story from coming out.

No it doesn't. It prevents certain evidence from tainting the trial. Having been sentenced to life in prison, there's really nothing a gag order could do to Ulbricht. And I don't even know what gag orders you're talking about.

>The prossecution was afraid that the case could get thrown out on a technicality if all the information was presented, thus letting a guilty man go free (let's get real, he's guilty, but we just will never know to what extent), so they suppressed as much as they could to ensure he doesn't get off.

I already discussed the topic of how the FBI located the servers originally. Is this what you're referring to? You do realize it is not illegal for the FBI to hack international servers, and in fact the FBI has done so before, and seized servers without warrant, and the Courts have upheld the seizure as lawful and denied a 4th Amendment protection because of the international nature. It's why he didn't assert this protection— his lawyers knew it was a dead end and would amount to a tacit admission.

The NSA does have reason to protect the true nature of its capabilities against Tor, and that is reason enough to construct a parallel narrative to be presented in court, which is not in and of itself a violation of due process.

No, it's not. You're taking a robotic view, where you are only personally responsible for the literal action you did. Society has a brain and can see the nuances of life. A burger is statistically harmless and prepared under the right conditions society deems it safe for sale and eating. Also people like burgers and they don't kill you unless you make a thousand other poor decisions in your life. Heroin, cocaine, and meth have much more real, immediate, destructive effects, and society (through fear, reason, experience, whatever) wants nothing to do with them.

Life isn't always fair, bud. Cars are useful and most people know how to drive safely drive them. Society still functions when we all drive cars. That's why they're legal. Heroin and cocaine do not let society function properly, and society doesn't want to deal with the harmful effects and strains their users put on society. Deal with it.

And there will always be something ""most statistically likely to kill you but still legal."" Duh. If heroin was legal, I'm sure that would supersede cars.

"I did some really rough calculations in [another comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/37rfjz/silk_road_operator_ross_ulbricht_to_sentenced/crq4948). But I can answer this: It's estimated 43,982 people died from drug-related deaths (this including illegal and legal drugs) in 2013 in the US. A 2009 survey showed that 23.9 million americans had illegally used drugs in the past month. If we say they used drugs all year, that'd be a death rate of 1.8%. Realistically, the death rate would probably be higher if we limited it to ""regular users"" of drugs and not the college kids who ate their first pot brownie last week at the time of the survey. Or, you know, limited it to ""hard"" drugs. Ironically, it'd likely be lower if we looked at only illegal drugs, and did not include misuse of legally prescribed ones. But that's beside the point.

If only 21,000 people bought drugs from the silk road, you would need ~378 deaths to match the rate of drug-related deaths in the general population. Again, this is ridiculously rough and also conservative. It can be estimated that in the 6 months before it was taken down, the silk road was processing over 5000 drug transactions on the daily. I think that's more than 21,000 people.

So you'd need like at least 378 suspected deaths before I'd actually bother to do the math with much stricter numbers and not ones that likely drastically over-estimate the drug-deaths in america and drastically under-estimate the drug-users on the silk road.

"No it's not. It's conflating tragic results of legal activities to illegal activities.  One is legal, one is not.  End of story.  Find a comparable *illegal* activity and compare and contrast the penalties involved would be a valid comparison.  Trying to say a legal activity, whatever the horrendous end game maybe, is the same as illegal activities does not hold water and only makes the arguments defending Ulbricht specious.  It's apples and oranges.  Explain to me, if Ulbricht had run his drug empire from out of his house, how is that different from any other drug dealer?  Why is a drug market in the cyber sphere given a pass that a drug dealer working the streets doesn't get?  Why should the coke dealer on the street get a harsher sentence than one who, not only allows it, but get's a commission on every sale, than the guy who facilitates it on the online?  This entire argument of ""well smoking kills, drinking kills, driving cars kill"" entirely circumvents the question of legality.  As I said, trying to draw parallels between legal actions and illegal actions is disingenuous at best, willingly stupid at worst.  And don't even get me started on the whole ""bankers, pedophile rings, etc"" argument.  That's tantamount to saying ""hey, my neighbor is fucking horses, why aren't you prosecuting this guy for fucking sheep"".  That's how the law works.

I can see the appeal of pinning that on Ross but, I don't want to seem apologetic, I don't think you could argue that was directly Ross or SR's fault. 

I hate this part about SR. On the one hand people who are 'pro' argue that SR is probably saving lives because there is less contact with dealers and less risk for users. People who are against argue people are dying as a direct result of SR. None of those arguments can really be conclusively proven but they are important arguments in the discussion about hard drugs.

"But put it in perspective.  I mean, you've gotta note that pure drugs alone do not cause many OD's, but the use concurrent drugs (illegal or otherwise) which make overdose more likely. One of the most common causes of overdose with heroin, for example, is using it in conjunction with alcohol (supposedly it's the cause for ~40% of heroin overdoses, tranquilizers are implicated in ~another 30%). The evidence linking these 6 deaths to the silk road does not include a toxicology report or medical records, which means we cannot rule out causes of death that are actually more the fault of other things than the drugs themselves.

And even if the drugs alone are to fault, from the size of the silk road, six is a really, really low tally.

For kicks, I did some calculations just to illustrate that:

The CDC estimates 43,982 deaths were a result of drug overdose in 2013 in the U.S. (note, this includes both OD's from illegal and legal drugs from my understanding). In 2009 it was estimated that 23.9 million americans used drugs in an illegal manor (either the drug was illegal or their use of it was). So the death rate of illegal/illicit drug use in the US is approximately 1.8%. 

There's all sorts of estimates about how many sellers and users were on the silk road over the course of it's existence, one quick query came up with ""30,000 and 150,000 active customers."" To be conservative, let's use the lower number. Wikipedia says ~70% of transactions involved drugs. So lets say 21,000 people bought drugs off of the silk road during the totality of it's operation. This is, again, very conservative - because active customers does not mean customers for the entirety of the site's existence, and just because 30% of the transactions *weren't* drugs doesn't mean those customers didn't buy drugs, too. Anyway, back to the numbers: if their drug-related deaths matched the death rate in the regular (U.S.) population, we'd expect 378 deaths total per year as a result of drugs bought on the silk road. The silk road was up for like two and a half years. So we'd be looking at a ultra-conservative estimate of ~945 deaths total.  And this is the ridiculously conservative calculation. If I used 90,000 customers (halfway between 30k and 150k) for that first step, we'd expect 2,835. If I went with 150,000, it'd be 4,725. And it'd still be conservative. And all of them would still probably be underestimates.

And we've got 6 suspected cases. Just 6. 

If silk road drug users were ODing at a rate even close to the rate of general users in the US... you'd think there'd be more suspected cases. As is, 6 cases represent 0.6% of the total expected with *the most ultraconservative possible basic estimate* i made. 

And, obviously, these calculations aren't very strict. They're very rough, which is why i was so conservative. But even conservatively, it makes 6 cases, even *proven*, *legitimate* cases of drug death due to drugs bough on the silk road, look infinitesimal in comparison to all drugs in general. You'd need a lot more than 6 cases to convince me that the silk road is as dangerous or more dangerous than other drug sources.

">The majority of those imprisoned are minority...

When we make things an issue based on race it automatically excludes the concerns of most people. It is correct that minorities are targeted more for arrest and incarceration. There is no question about it. We have laws that specifically target certain races and cultures. Our law enforcement police and surveil minority areas to a much greater degree than most. But it is not like 95% of the prison population is minorities. It is imbalanced but not nearly to that extent.

However, we need to look even broader. If we are going to claim that the justice system is biased against minorities based on the numbers and the facts then we must draw back and look at how biased the system is towards gender. 96% of all incarcerated individuals are men. That is simply ludicrous and mind boggling in this time of supposed equal rights. It was understandable back in the days when coverture laws were common and men were imprisoned for the crimes of their wives. But what we have now is a system that specifically and unduly targets one class of people over the other to such an extreme that it is impossible to deny a severe prejudice.

Just as there are laws that target minorities and certain cultures, there are laws that target men specifically. The whole moral panic over sexual crimes hysteria is 100% directed at men. If a woman commits the same sex crime as a man she is rarely punished or, if punished, never given as harsh of a sentence. Even crimes that are majority women driven (like embezzlement, prostitution, infanticide, etc.) are rarely convicted and usually blamed on men. Prostitution is being championed as a crime against women by men. You have probably heard of ""human trafficking"" by now, I am sure. That is a way to make prostitutes not liable for their actions and places all the onus upon the men.

If we are going to decry that the justice system is not fair, we cannot only select the minorities to get upset about. We have to look at how the system specifically targets and incarcerates men as  a whole. Women are practically unscathed by the system.";1;0;False;MR_Movement;crq5ix3;Silk Road operator Ross Ulbricht to sentenced life in prison;37rfjz;http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/may/29/silk-road-ross-ulbricht-sentenced

I may be reading between the lines a bit, but your post seems to suggest for-profit prisons or the demand for prison labor are somehow causative with respect to the war on drugs. While I agree the 'slavery' you speak of is pretty sad and immoral, it's certainly not the reason behind the mass incarceration that's going on. People often talk about private prisons and the war on drugs, but corporate run prisons make up a very small percentage of the overall U.S. prison system. Drug prohibition and the war on drugs predates the rise in private prisons significantly. I guess my main point is, the war on drugs is/was an ideologically driven movement with puritan, social conservative, religious, and racist elements to it. The 'working for pennies' stuff is just a bit of salt on the wound. ;14;4;False;ssswca;crpca1o;Silk Road operator Ross Ulbricht to sentenced life in prison;37rfjz;http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/may/29/silk-road-ross-ulbricht-sentenced

"The judge has mentioned:

> there is ample and unambiguous evidence that [Ulbricht] commissioned five murders to protect his commercial enterprise

Even without a victim, obviously you have to punish that. (I'd given 5-10 years max btw not this ridiculous life bs). 

Same thing for drugs, if you accept that the SR facilitated the use of addictive, destructive drugs like heroin, which is not unlikely, one can argue there is some accountability. I think that's rather fair and I'm a proponent of legalising soft drugs completely, but I think there's a difference between a working dad who smokes pot twice a month to relax, and ANY person (a 14 year old kid) who has access to ANY drug (heroin) without any oversight, quality control etc. It's tremendously dangerous.

And I mention heroin because one kid overdosed on it, heroin from the SR. Obviously this kid is a victim, and obviously selling harddrugs, addictive and destructive ones, in any context (like to a minor) ought to be a crime. Which makes all this victimless crime bs in this subreddit a bit disappointing. 

In short I think he was really stupid, appears to have commissioned assasinations, and has some (not full but some) accountability in victims of highly dangerous products he facilitated the sale off to people who shouldn't use them. For that I'd not find 5-10 years unreasonable. Life is just insane.

At the same time the SR ought to be a huge wake up call to government. They ought to become the SR, legalise softdrugs completely, become the supplier, the overseer, the regulator, the quality control inspector, generate tax revenues and make the market safe, accessible, root out drug related crime etc etc. The SR unquestionably was partially a force for good which ought to be emulated by government, or privatised in a safe and regulated context.";3;1;False;IkmoIkmo;crpbj3q;Silk Road operator Ross Ulbricht to sentenced life in prison;37rfjz;http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/may/29/silk-road-ross-ulbricht-sentenced

Did anyone else not understand this line of logic? What does the bronx have to do with the silk road? Isn't that precisely the point they *were trying to make*?

That this drug emporium offered people the ability to *bypass* places like the bronx, in order to receive drugs at a much higher quality of standard with less personal risk?

Here's one example of how this place helped provide safer drug use, this one with [MDMA] (http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/health/mdma-social-anxiety-autistic-adults-scientists-article-1.2235950):
> 
>  The MDMA used in the study is safer than Ecstasy and Molly because it is pure, Danforth said. The street drugs are usually contaminated, with only 20% of Ecstasy pills even containing MDMA in some samples, and can be harmful, she said.
> 
> **The pure form has rarely had serious adverse effects in lab studies, Danforth said.**
> 
> ...
> 
> ""Over the last century, researchers have examined MDMA's effect on 1133 people in various studies, according to the article in the journal Progress and Neuro-Psychopharmacology and Biological Psychiatry.
> 
> It's had little negative effect and has even helped people, including those with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, Danforth said.""

Being able to source cleaner drugs by not having to deal with shady people who are constantly cutting drugs on the street, and bypassing that dangerous situation all together seems to me to be a much safer and more responsible direction.

We know that Regan's war on drugs is a dismal failure at a extreme expense to the nation. You cannot win this war, so shouldn't you instead focus on *harm reduction* ? If they *really* cry 'its for the people' then shouldnt they demonstrate it by having positive actions instead of negative ones?

It is so obviously wrong it is laughable. Am I the only one that finds this wrong? C'mon people!!! Selling liquor or guns is the same as selling drugs.

> Ross Ulbricht, the man behind illegal online drug emporium Silk Road, was sentenced to life in prison on Friday by Judge Katherine Forrest of Manhattan&#039;s US district court for the southern district of New York.

> Ulbricht&#039;s defense argued that the Silk Road was in fact a boon to the health of its clients, especially those who habitually used drugs.

> &quot;Silk Road created [users] who hadn&#039;t tried drugs before,&quot; Forrest said, adding that Silk Road &quot;Expands the market&quot; and places demand on drug-producing areas in Afghanistan and Mexico that grow the poppies used for heroin.

"I'm going to piggy back on this comment so people hopefully see why he deserves life.

Should drugs be decriminalized? Yes. But they also need to be extremely well respected. They can be extremely dangerous. Some can kill or harm you just because of certain genetics in your family. You have no idea where they were made or what adulterants were in the finish product. Or even what you got was what you got, because many people have been seriously hurt by that or killed.

There needs to be widely available information on the drugs and help you can seek after if they ever had a death grip on your life.

There are so many things that need to be thoroughly planned for decriminalization it would take thousands of pages to write about.

Now who knows how many people were harmed, killed or lives ruined because of all that I mentioned above. You want change? Fine. But not like this, it made it way too easy for anyone to get anything they want without and safety behind legal / decriminalized drugs.

And don't even get me started on how many designer drugs that were on there with no data behind them or very little.";-5;1;False;;crpibrf;Silk Road operator Ross Ulbricht to sentenced life in prison;37rfjz;http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/may/29/silk-road-ross-ulbricht-sentenced

Paradigm shift in treatment of addiction holds promise, thanks to epigenetics

* Preston B. (16) - jumped off a balcony under the effects of synthetic LSD, provided by a friend who bought it on Silk Road
* Bryan B. (25) - died from opiates bought off of Silk Road, which he was just trying for the first time according to his internet searches

* Scott W. (36) - died from multiple drug toxicity, had over 70 orders on Silk Road over half a year
* Jacob L. (22) - consumed heroin, cocaine, and meth which aggravated his pneumonia and killed him, had 30 orders on Silk Road over a year

> The deaths detailed above highlight the obvious fact that the distribution of controlled substances can lead to serious bodily harm, including death, particularly when distributed in the massive aggregate quantities sold on Silk Road. Moreover, for every death caused by Silk Road drugs, there are doubtlessly many more destructive addictions that were fueled by the site. The trial testimony of Mr. Duch provided a glimpse into these consequences of Silk Road. Mr. Duch explained that he became a Silk Road vendor after struggling to finance his own crushing addiction to heroin, which was costing him thousands of dollars a week. Mr. Duch acknowledged that many of his customers on Silk Road were suffering from similar addictions. Indeed, he testified that, nearly every day, he would receive messages from his buyers indicating they were anxiously awaiting their shipments in order to avoid the onset of withdrawal symptoms. (Tr. dated Jan. 28, 2015, at 1510:6-1512:17). “[I]s there anyway you could ship it overnight,” asked one buyer, noting, “I am throwing up, the worst of the worst withdrawl [*sic*] symptoms and plus i have life destroying pain.” (GX-704 at 2). “[I] see ur cutoff time is 3,” wrote another, adding, “[I] just wanna double check because i am EXTREMELY dope sick and  NEED something by tomorrow!!” (*Id.* at 1). These messages are, of course, only examples from Mr. Duch’s set of customers. Given that the site as a whole had over 100,000 customers and was regularly selling all manner of highly addictive substances, the full scope of the drug dependency sustained by Silk Road is far broader.^(11)

He wasn't ever convicted of this. If he did truly try to get people assassinated and he is found guilty then he should face due punishment for that. Thing is he was never found guilty of that those charges were never filed in this case and the one murder for hire charge that does exist is in a separate court case with a  verdict yet to be determined. Instead he just got life in prison having been convicted of only non violent offences showing him to be a victim of the drug war. That's what /r/Bitcoin is pissed about.

But this interpretation of morality is the very cornerstone of the anti-drug policy under which Ulbricht was sentenced. According to this interpretation, the drug is a product. The product is purported to have ill side effects in excess of useful side effects. Whether or not this is actually true is debatable, but the product is banned because of these perceived properties. Therefore, whoever sells the product *despite the ban* is responsible for the ill side effects.
