"Oh that! Yeah, but gold is only as good as the consensus of people who believe it's good, because otherwise it's just a rock at the end of the day.

You could back the U.S. Dollar with Bitcoin, providing there was a broad enough consensus to support it, and the effect would obviously be no different from gold. In contrast, the Aztec Indians used ""cocoa beans"" as money, but NOT gold, because that was their consensus.

The U.S. Dollar actually continues to enjoy tremendous consensus value all over the world, at least from an institutional perspective, when you consider that it is used as the world's ""reserve"" currency and has been for generations. But I wish they would back the Dollar with Bitcoin, because I would probably become an overnight multi-billionaire even though I only have 30 of them...🤑";1;0;False;51percentile;evtqum8;Well yes, but actually no;cki5pl;https://i.redd.it/l8rphrpnyqd31.jpg

"Its just wrong, look at bitcoin, it doubles every few years and still people are spending them instead of ONLY holding them, how does that fit into your theory?

You are just talking about well studies assumptions but we can see my argument in action in bitcoin.

If your argument would be true people wouldn't spend ANY bitcoin.

You can't eat money, you can't fly with it somewhere, you can literally only hold or spend it.

Are you serious? They are buying a selling it in a financial trade market. That's not the same kind of spending. There is a meme around bitcoin, HODL is literally saying HOLD bitcoin. The opposite of spend. IDK what  paradigm you are operating under but people are not spending bitcoin and that is one of the central issues.

and btw the type of spending that drives an economy is not little packets of gum but economic private investments. Major spending into factories to increase production. That kind of spending.

"> You want stability.

No, I want falling prices.

>If the value of bitcoin is always rising then people are less likely to spend their coins

I really apprecheate this conversation. I had a lot like them.
Imagine this scenario: You have bitcoins for 1000$, you are holding them for 3 Years. Let's say you now have 10.000$. Since you now have 10x the amount of money you are more likely to spend some. 
But bitcoin rises in value you don't want to sell all of them. So you just spend 2.000$ worth of btc. You've now stimulated the economy more than 100% of what you could have done with fiat. The stimulus argument works only if you look at prices for a couple of weeks or months.

It's unrealistic to think people wont spend their money. They have to spend it for rent food etc.
Your (maybe) next argument will be: ""What if everybody stops buying btc"" it's just the same as saying ""what if everyone stops using yen"" it's unrealistic.

But what are we actually doing here? We are just making assumptions about how people would behave in specific cases - I think nobody of us is completly right. We just have an educated guess, it's not more than our opinion. 

I don't want to be on the side that guesses that if money loses value is the best for all of us, sry. It just doesn't make sense to give all the value that is generated each year +~2% to bankers instead of the people. I don't know how you even can remotly think its a good thing.

"IT's not always advantages for an economy to have a continually rising value of currency. You want stability. If the value of bitcoin is always rising then people are less likely to spend their coins because in the future it could be worth more. When people aren't spending coins then business won't earn money.


So yes, the economy is working well under the dollar but it would be catastrophic under bitcoin.";1;1;False;McBeeff;evtbckp;Well yes, but actually no;cki5pl;https://i.redd.it/l8rphrpnyqd31.jpg

"> No, I want falling prices.

What are you even saying? You want prices to fall continually? Do you even understand what that has done in the past?

>  Let's say you now have 10.000$. Since you now have 10x the amount of money you are more likely to spend some.

This is exactly the opposite of what people actually do given this scenario. This type of behavior has been studied extensively in economics and history. It is very very likely people will hold their money and store it for future. If every 3 years your money increases by an order of magnitude then spending that money is literally the single worst thing you could do with it. Why not just wait another 3 years and make 100k? by spending 2 grand now you are giving up earning 20k in the future, all things equal. Not smart. 

> But what are we actually doing here? We are just making assumptions about how people would behave in specific cases - I think nobody of us is completly right. We just have an educated guess, it's not more than our opinion.

That's what the entire field of economics studies. Decision making. So yes it's well documented and researched. It's deeper then just you or my opinion. These opinions have to cohere with economic theory.

You don't understand how it works. The goal is price stability because with stable prices people are more optimistic about future expenditure. So when the Fed cuts the interest on the funds rate, even tho it may devalue the dollar slightly, it incentives people to spend their money which will increase economic growth. The Fed can also increase the funds rate, or sell bonds, or decrease the reserve ratio in order to deflate the currency if they need to avoid hyperinflation or limit economic growth. These policies are designed to increase economic growth and maintain stable prices.";1;1;False;McBeeff;evtg77a;Well yes, but actually no;cki5pl;https://i.redd.it/l8rphrpnyqd31.jpg
