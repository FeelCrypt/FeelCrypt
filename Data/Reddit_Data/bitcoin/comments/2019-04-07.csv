You are so ignorant to reality I'm not sure this is worth continuing, but I'll try.  Complexities of human life? Human life is complex, but understanding what groups (like libs) are trying to achieve is incredibly easy to comprehend.  It's a low self-esteem, low achievement, low prospect herd movement that wants to bring everyone down to their level.  This is so blatantly obvious that the only people who don't see this are those (you) knee-deep in this myopia. Their social reward system is predicated on what you catch other people doing (or not doing, but still accusing them anyway) vs what they actually do.  So where does that leave us?  A group and a generation with no sense of self, looking to be outraged at every corner, no idea how to achieve personal success and fulfillment OR how to get there... so instead they say the world is unfair and feel justified in making everyone else suffer (this is perceived suffering of course) along with them.

This doesn't pay for the proposed programs even with 100% tax on the top 1%(no way you would even be able to collect this but for the sake of argument lets assume this reality can exist). Not even close. 

Additionally, now you are talking about capitalism with large entitlement programs **paid by the poor and middle class primarily**... not socialism

>Is everyone poor in scandanavia?

Scandinavia is not socialist, their leaders have to constantly remind people from the USA this fact.

Scandinavia is more capitalistic than the USA in certain respects.

The US has much higher typical average corporate taxes (39.1%) than Denmark (24.5%) , Norway (27%) , and Sweden (22%). I find it hilarious how so many US citizens complain about the evil corporations and at the same time hold the ideal of these social democratic countries to such a high regard while they pay for their welfare programs by heavily taxing the poor and middle class and giving tax breaks to corporations.

Yes, I understand that the USA recently (into effect 2018) cut corporate tax rates but this narrative we are discussing goes back 20+ years where the USA typically has much higher corporate taxes.

"You are asking a complex question which doesn't have simple solutions. Socialism leads to much larger problems like we have seen in Cuba and Venezuela in regards to wealth inequality. 

More individual capitalism and empowerment and less crony capitalism and a realistic realization that wealth inequality will always exist and should always exist (although IMHO is a bit too high now)

This can be done by the state trying to empower the individual and small business owner. The specific solutions to this are many as there is no panacea or magic bullet  so I will give one example to address global warming and wealth inequality - 

Give further tax incentives for wind, hydro, solar power for individual consumers. This has another side effect of increasing energy independence. modernize the electric grid and pass regulation forcing public electric companies to buy back green energy created from homes and businesses into the grid. (In the USA some jurisdictions allow this , others do not). 

What this can do is empower individuals to not be dependent upon  the resources of the state and corporations and actually get a check for any excess green energy produced raising a families income. 

Another solution is Bitcoin , because it removes the power of the state, banks, and insiders to tax the poor and middle class with inflation and create perverse incentives where people are incentivized to take on debt rather than save.

">>What would you advocate as the solution to increasing inequality and runaway climate change?

The policy suggestions are ridiculous in the GND and will actually be harmful to the environment. It is patently obvious that the GND is merely virtue signalling without any serious solutions.

More realistic solutions would be a comprehensive plan to

1) Give further tax incentives for wind, hydro, solar power for individual consumers. This has another side effect of increasing energy independence.

2) More nuclear power

3) Building up sea walls in places like South Florida/ New Orleans because climate change is going to occur regardless of what the USA does because they make up around 15% of CO2 output worldwide and China and India are growing in pollution. The sea wall can be in part privately funded by incentivising businesses building ontop of them. 

4) Giving large tax credits to cruise ships or sea platforms that want to test some of the global dimming proposals (creating more cloud cover with sea water)

5) modernize the electric grid and pass regulation forcing public electric companies to buy back green energy created from homes and businesses into the grid. (In the USA some jurisdictions allow this , others do not)

The problem is dynamic. You wouldn't constantly tax the wealthy to fund the social safety net. The USA is one of the most unequal in the world. My solution would be to start by taxing the super wealthy and the corporations to fund a massive infrastructure development program, universal healthcare and Finland-style education system. This would improve the poorest communities and lead to an education-fuelled productivity boom. This would massively expand the middle class. Then, when the middle class is starting to gain momentum and have more wealth, you could gradually increase the income tax from the bottom downwards. This only happens once the society has generally become a lot more equal.

"I agree with you, but in the beginning of sagan's book he talks about the need for science to be expanded upon in future generations in this quote: 

""... I know that the consequences of scientific illiteracy are far more dangerous in our time than in any that has come before. It's perilous and foolhardy for the average citizen to remain ignorant about global warming, say, or ozone depletion, air pollution, toxic and radioactive wastes, acid rain, topsoil erosion, tropical deforestation, exponential population growth. ...How can we affect national policy -- or even make intelligent decisions in our own lives -- if we don't grasp the underlying issue?"" - Carl Sagan (Demon Haunted World, 1995)

I think it's not so much about the govt controlling those who are anti-intellectual, and more about the growing need for us to ""wake up"" to the fact that we are imenentally and rapidly approaching our own self-built demise, and the wave of growing pseudoscience is only increasing the gap between those who understand our dilemma, and those who would rather ignore it.
