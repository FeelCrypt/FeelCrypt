"Thought i would add this, another way to quit smoking cigarettes that worked for me (Almost 1 year now) was to start vaping. Obviously it would be much healthier to just stop smoking all together. But if you start having problems staying off cigs, this could really help. You still get your nicotine fix, but you subtract most of whats  hurting you in regular cigarettes. Nicotine itself is as bad for you as caffeine is. Just like caffeine its not ""good"" for you. But its considerably less damaging then regular cigs. After about about 6 months of vaping, i ended up quiting that too!  I know this is unrealted to Bitcoin, i just wanted to help out the OP with how i quit.

"We go out and buy groceries with dollars because we know our money is most valuable being spent now than later.  A dollar today is worth more than a dollar next year, so you'd rather exchange it for goods and services as soon as possible.

We don't go out and buy groceries with Bitcoin because we know our Bitcoin is most valuable not being spent now than later.  A Bitcoin next year is (in theory for HODLers) worth more than a Bitcoin today, so you'd rather defer goods and services and avoid paying someone with Bitcoin.

There are pros and cons to each. 

Edit: For the record, this is merely an example.  Sure, if I absolutely needed some groceries then I'd absolutely sell whatever assets I had (including Bitcoin) to eat.   Groceries are obviously a bad item to use as an argument since immediate necessities are going to be purchased as required to survive; however, you can replace groceries with some other item.   But part of the reason I don't spend Bitcoin as of yet and so many others just HODL, is because I feel it will be worth more in time - that's all I was getting at.  I could also pay employees or the kid that mows yards in my neighborhood with Bitcoin I've accumulated but then it also in my interest not to pay someone with something I feel will increase in value and instead offer them something that will defeease in value.


People hoarding Bitcoin for the sole purpose of increasing its value and perpetually just putting off purchases (regardless of what that purchase is) isn't exactly a perfectly better situation than people just spending idiotically due to their currency losing buying power.  


The other problem is accumulation of power through control of the currency.  One of the reason new dollars are pumped into the system exists is to help (perhaps innefficiently) the amount of people who control the currency.  If people could hold all the currency, they'd hold all the power.  So if we have few people who hold a huge amount of Bitcoin (early HODLers) than they have a huge advantage in the control of the currency and power then it puts them in a better position to accumulate and hold even more of it. 

Sure, government prints our currency and its largely controlled and maintained by banks, there is wealth inequality, so it isnt perfect either, but those institutions just holding onto that cash in a safe or under their mattress would lose value over time.

Secondly this is how people imagine spending behavior would play out but as far as I can tell it is not based on reality or actual data.

"> capital to start businesses and create jobs may just decide to sit on their money instead of invest in new companies. 

That is only true if the deflationary increase of value is bigger than the increase of value through return on investment.

When that business can choose between hodling and gaining, say 4% through deflation or investing and gaining 5% roi it will choose the latter. 

I'm only saying it is not as black-white.

We actually have proof currently: When I hodl my €3000 that I earned, in a year that is worth €2925 because of 2.5% inflation. 
But, when I decide to spend it now, on goods that keep their value, say, two very good chairs, I have €2625 worth in ""chairs"". I've essentially lost €300 over hodling?

Why? Because of VAT (I used 12.5%, in EU it is more like 21%). VAT is a tax that actually punishes people spending instead of hodling. Yet, we still spend. 

Why? Because we need to. We need chairs, iphones, pizzas, beans, cars.

"Deflation encourage savings but paralyzes the economy, which results in less jobs, less products manufactured, less services offered, and ultimately no GDP growth. Deflation is what killed the Japanese economy in the 90s.

Not to mention that, as I said above, the price decrease doesn't just happen for no reason and is not uniform throughout the economy. The price decrease happens because the people producing the goods can charge less and are forced to through inflation.

"> People NEED to be encouraged to save, not the other way around!

People in China save on a large scale, and it's a huge economic problem.

Saving is the rational thing for *individuals* to do when they don't have a social safety net and their future is uncertain. The only way to save is if there is a functioning economy in which other people are spending, though. 

The economy as a whole cannot save, because it has nowhere to put the savings. Money, whether BTC or fiat or gold, is an *illusion* of value. Real value is being able to trade these credits, which are mostly without intrinsic value, for real goods. The only way you can do that is if those goods are being produced, and then only to the extent they are being produced.

Society can't save because there's no economical way to have a static store of potatoes, or whatever have you, for 50 years down the road. The best society can do is develop and maintain systems that will produce those goods 50 years down the road. But the best way to have such systems in 50 years is to use them, which is done by people spending.

If everyone saves, the economy's production capacity withers, and the money is also worth less because there's not as much you can buy with it. Trying to ""save"" at the level of an economy is a death spiral.

The economy runs best if no one saves. This is greatly facilitated by social safety nets being strong enough that there isn't incentive to save, to begin with.";5;1;False;SushiAndWoW;dmp35o8;The difference between inflation and deflation...;6yn8hs;https://i.redd.it/zs4byvahrgkz.jpg

Why do we need to boost the economy? So that companies make more money. Why do we need the companies to make more money: so that they can increase the value of theirs shares (if shares were a currency, they would be deflationary: more about that soon) and hire more people doing full time jobs and pay higher salaries. Why do people need higher salaries? So that ... they can consume more.

So basically we need people to consume more so that there is enough demand to occupy them full time so that they may maximize their income so that they can consume more. Meanwhile we are destroying the environment and wasting our lives. And the most ironic thing is that the upper class invests its savings in stocks ... which value is constantly growing thanks to the inflationnary monetary policy ... which encourages them to keep their capital in the stock market instead of consuming.

"Debt in itself really isn't a bad thing at all. It allows people and businesses to acquire things (and start accruing their benefits) today, and those net benefits are greater than not using a loan. This is the basic theory behind all loans - the increased income from a college degree is greater than the cost of the tuition loan, purchasing a house today is less expensive than saving while renting an apartment for years, and financing a car is better than not having one. Loans are completely voluntary - if they weren't mutually beneficial, billions of people wouldn't be taking them.

"**Market failure**

In economics, market failure is a situation in which the allocation of goods and services is not efficient. That is, there exists another conceivable outcome where at least one individual may be made better-off without making someone else worse-off. Market failures can be viewed as scenarios where individuals' pursuit of pure self-interest leads to results that are not efficient – that can be improved upon from the societal point of view. The first known use of the term by economists was in 1958, but the concept has been traced back to the Victorian philosopher Henry Sidgwick.

"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_failure

Depending on your definition of capitalism, it doesn't really make sense to cite market failure as a failing of capitalism; especially since, most people would define, not only capitalism - but virtually any other system, as being impossible without some government controlled aspects and some market provisioned aspects.

So ""market failure"" plagues virtually all systems (as does government failure); but the particular balance of the use of these two methods of organizing society and distributing scarce resources, in capitalism; has empirically proven to be far superior (in terms of providing wealth, peace and prosperity) than any other system.

Thus rendering your critique meaningless.  ";3;1;False;kwanijml;dmpblgf;The difference between inflation and deflation...;6yn8hs;https://i.redd.it/zs4byvahrgkz.jpg

True.

And what is driving consumtion? Investments? (yes, for a small part)

Mostly, consumption is driven by need. For the sake of the argument, lets ignore the huge portion of consumption driven by markenting. 

We need cars. We need computers, iphones, wine, water, sheep, bricks. People invest in a brick-factory because of ""the demand for bricks"". 

And we buy bricks because we need houses? And why do we need them? Because living under a bridge, or with your mom sucks (pun not intended). We buy a house because we need to. House-buying is not driven by the decreasing value of a savings account. It is driven by the need for a roof. (edit: the rest is what we call a housing bubble)

I'm simply trying to explain that the silly investment-inflation combination is based on a lot of presumptions  that are only true because of that same investment-inflation combination presumption.

"> You can account for deflation but that doesn't negate it's effect - loans are still going to be more expensive. 

Wrong. You can index the principle balance to deflation and recalculate the payments. The actual additional cost can be ZERO.

The only reason loans are setup to ignore inflation today is because inflation is politically-popular and people imagine they are getting cheaper houses because of inflation. 

In actuality, the math of housing payments makes them pay nearly three times the actual amount loaned, and there are all sorts of contractual tricks employed to ensure that the lender does not lose money on the loan remotely. And lending is locked in by law to this style.

But none of that is necessary. You can easily, easily write a loan contract that would take into account deflation and not cost the borrower extra money thereby. Easily.

> Economists generally believe that deflation is a problem in a modern economy because it increases the real value of debt, especially if the deflation is unexpected. Deflation may also aggravate recessions and lead to a deflationary spiral.


> A deflationary spiral is a situation where decreases in price lead to lower production, which in turn leads to lower wages and demand, which leads to further decreases in price. Since reductions in general price level are called deflation, a deflationary spiral occurs when reductions in price lead to a vicious circle, where a problem exacerbates its own cause. In science, this effect is also known as a positive feedback loop. Another economic example of this principle is a bank run.

"**Deflation**

In economics, deflation is a decrease in the general price level of goods and services. Deflation occurs when the inflation rate falls below 0% (a negative inflation rate). Inflation reduces the real value of money over time; conversely, deflation increases the real value of money –  the currency of a national or regional economy. This allows one to buy more goods and services than before with the same amount of money.

* Keynesian economics produces a system of debt because inflation decreases the real value of that debt over time. Deflation causes the real value of debts to increase over time.

Which is a lot. And you only mess with older more materialist thinkers - millenials want memories and experiences and within a finite lifespan the matter of quantity vs quality is more complicated for such purposes, but deflationary money may hurt that and in the end we'll end up with an acceleration of the already growing gap between the haves and the have-nots while reducing the happiness of the have-nots.

"Sorry, not correct:  in a deflationary environment, interest rates will rise, creating again in equilibrium, the same overall incentives to invest. 

Now with higher rates, there will be less borrowing on the margin, but this is offset by the larger stock of saving...in other words, borrowers don't need to borrow as much (because they have more savings to start with, and can thus afford a higher rate on a smaller principal): the stock of savings being what produces the commensurate rate of interest on borrowing.

The same amount of capital projects will occur (ceteris paribus), as in an inflationary environment...the ratio of funds used from savings or borrowing will simply shift more to savings.

Money is neutral in the long run.

Currently investors do the same: ""store it on some saving acct or invest it"" a simple calculation.

My figures were purely fictional and only meant to illustrate that saying ""inflation is good because it pushes people to invest"" is incomplete, undecided and overall unscientifical.

"Bitcoin and other cryptos do not work like traditional money, and it isn't just because they are appreciating in value. 

Investing in a crypto is really investing in its underlying network. In order to use the network, one requires that network's respective currency. Consequently, the more valuable the network becomes, the more demand there is for its native currency. 

Likewise, the more valuable bitcoin becomes, the more secure the network becomes and the more demand there is to use the network for crypto-economy projects. We haven't yet seen this demand fully express itself because the scaling war slowed Bitcoin innovation and prevented it from fully opening its doors to realize the demand, but once it does I expect a massive flood into bitcoin. We know the demand is there, look at Ethereum, and once bitcoin makes itself available to that demand it will be a sight to see. 

So investment into Bitcoin is essential for its growth, and its growth is essential to the use of its currency. 

The stronger Bitcoin's network becomes, the more projects and economic infrastructure depends upon it, the more the value of bitcoin becomes entrenched. Once it is understood that the only way for the value of the currency to be destroyed would be for its respective network to be destroyed, and when that network grows to the point of becoming indispensable to society in a way similar to how the internet is today, the reliability of bitcoin's value will seem as secure as the value of the US dollar. At that point one will actually be able to say that bitcoin has something akin to ""intrinsic value"" -- i.e., the concept that a money has value even if it ceases to be used as money.  

So it is essential to Bitcoin, and all cryptocurrencies, that its underlying currency be deflationary, at least during the growth phase. 

It is also important to point out that the crypto-economy involves many competing currencies, so we are dealing with a fundamentally different beast than national economies that rely on a single currency. **Because anyone is free to print their own money in the crypto-economy, it is vital that the base currencies be deflationary.** 

In fiat systems, you want a small amount of inflation to encourage lending and discourage loan defaults. When banks lend money, they do so by ""printing"" new money into existence. What prevents the system from spiraling into hyper-inflation is that money is destroyed when people repay their debts. Because there is always more debt in existence than money (since debt = money + interest) there has to be a constant rate of inflation to allow there to always be enough money to repay the debts. 

In the crypto-economy, by contrast, new money is printed into existence without usually having a way of being destroyed. This problem is obviated by the fact that new money usually comes in the form of new types of currencies, it isn't a printing of existing currencies. If someone wishes to print new money, for instance, they must create a new token, give it a new name, and sell it (e.g., through an ICO). The money supply of existing currencies isn't being affected by the expansion of the money supply in the crypto-economy. 

What this means is that the crypto-economy itself must discourage over-exuberance since there is no risk involved in creating one's own currency. That discouragement comes from the fact that established currencies are deflationary, and therefore new projects must be able to prove that they can outperform existing platforms. Because the crypto-economy is a competitive free-market, competition between currencies makes it so that monetary policy from a single institution aimed at artificially recreating the conditions of a free market is not required.

No spending = lower GDP.

Lower GDP means interest rates rise.

Interest rates up means property values inflate.

Property inflation = more people rent.

More rentors = less long term debts.

More disposable income now = more spending now.

You guys can't really believe it works like this, can you? Deflation over 2 years vs. inflation over 100 years is not even close to a fair comparison, to start. Secondly, deflation of this scale discourages an active economy (as we've already seen with BTC) and makes it worse, especially with a limited currency like BTC. People sit on their BTC and don't spend it because it's an investment. Third, cost of goods/services and salaries are (though sometimes poorly) adjusted for inflation. If you got paid $10/hr in 1929 you were doing really, really well. If you get paid $10 in 2017 you can barely make ends meet. Finally, you can't honestly believe that deflation will continue at the rate it has been with BTC forever.;15;2;False;32BitWhore;dmp0284;The difference between inflation and deflation...;6yn8hs;https://i.redd.it/zs4byvahrgkz.jpg

"2013 was special. Bitcoin was in its infancy as a profit medium. MtGox theft was huge, more than $100 million probably (real sale potential, not the $600 million theorical value). Bitcoin was bled dry back then. Thats not happening again. What happens now is fluctuations. Like it fluctuated 30% of its value up and down in 2 weeks. Somebody got to make few hundred thousand bucks from this. Thats how they'll make money from bitcoin from now on. And other cryptos, too. Litecoin or Bitcoin Cash are perfect examples on cryptos being just a gambling medium. There is absolutely no reason for them to exist, they're just software copies. Yet Litecoin has increased in price 2000% this year alone.

I don't see an endgame for cryptos anytime soon. The market is still young, people are loving the gambling, early buyers are still young and it will take many more years until they'll need to capitalize on their investments. So people will hold, the price will shoot up to $20.000+. So keep on playing!";1;0;False;ChickenBreast;dmo52an;Just Hodl It. (Found on FB);6yf179;https://i.redd.it/fvh3ibzxz8kz.jpg

Hmm, there are a few things wrong with this statement.

Population growth, while seemingly growing in a predictable manner, is not certain. On that same note, population growth doesn't necessarily mean more people will use Bitcoin.

Secondly, deflation != compounding value. The only compounding value you can make on currency is with banks/third parties that use an interest rate, where the exact compounding return can be calculated.
