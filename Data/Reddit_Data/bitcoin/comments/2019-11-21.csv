Yeah, but then hard drives fail, it might be infected with malware, et cetera. I'm not saying you *cannot* save it. I'm simply pointing out that holding 5ct Bitcoin was way different from holding Bitcoin in the last couple of years. You'd never even think of this when holding Netflix shares, which is kinda my point.;1;1;False;krokodilmannchen;f88xidd;Obvious choice;dyt93i;https://i.redd.it/ypu73lm7eqz31.jpg
Why not? Back it up and disconnect it from the internet. Where’s the risk? Put it in a safety deposit box if you want.;1;1;False;Agamemnon323;f88x5kv;Obvious choice;dyt93i;https://i.redd.it/ypu73lm7eqz31.jpg
"Okay, that still doesn't really matter though. Put $3.6k into bitcoin in 2010 at $0.05 and that is $576 million currently. So again just a single investment and order and we are essentially in line with your single all in... this would also give you the option of selling at any point so you can use that money (rather than continuing to live on $36k a year until your one single bet).
  
Just out of curiosity, do you think you would be able to buy an options position that would cover over 50% of outstanding shares? I don't doubt that you could buy a good portion, I just feel like someone trying to buy that level would not keep the price of the call at $1... nor that it would even be $1 to begin with, though I don't look at calls OTM 3 years out.";0;0;False;wighty;f86axlw;Obvious choice;dyt93i;https://i.redd.it/ypu73lm7eqz31.jpg
I think you vastly underestimate the chance of losing Bitcoin back in the day. But that's okay.

They are both work. You need to contact a broker and work with them to buy shares. With btc you need to save it to a couple hard drives and replace them occasionally. Seems close to the same amount of work to me.;1;1;False;Agamemnon323;f89gpde;Obvious choice;dyt93i;https://i.redd.it/ypu73lm7eqz31.jpg
I very well may. All I know about it is whatever I’ve seen mentioned about it on Reddit. That’s why I was asking about it. I don’t have time to read an article atm but I’ll try to remember to later.;1;0;False;Agamemnon323;f89k0ts;Obvious choice;dyt93i;https://i.redd.it/ypu73lm7eqz31.jpg

First thing I would do is see my late family members and spend some great family time. I would invest in bitcoin, but they'll be more important things to do than that first.

"come on dude i doubt you could buy many coins for 0.05$

price also fluctuated to 0.1 $ and 0.3$ and 0.41$

i would say 0.3$ would be more realistic :P";1;1;False;nayoz_;f88f8oe;Obvious choice;dyt93i;https://i.redd.it/ypu73lm7eqz31.jpg
Not really. You had a .json file (still do) but compared to current alternatives, it was too easy to lose your coins. Same thing with MtGox. I believe that 80% of Bitcoin transactions (buying and selling) passed through that website. Go figure.;1;1;False;krokodilmannchen;f87kxj3;Obvious choice;dyt93i;https://i.redd.it/ypu73lm7eqz31.jpg
How many is many? 100? 1000? Even at 0.1 a hundred bucks would net you over 100 mil. That seems alright to me.;1;1;False;Agamemnon323;f88xe8d;Obvious choice;dyt93i;https://i.redd.it/ypu73lm7eqz31.jpg
