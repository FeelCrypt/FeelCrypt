So the difference is they would not want the relationship to continue, and neither would I. Only babies =)

The trick is getting them to understand that they will not be bound to me, for having a baby. They will continue as they do - which is what they want. They don't want 'my drama' - so that is fine. But they can still have the baby.

"unfortunately this sub has become polluted with people like you who don't actually get it - people who don't even understand the very first thing about the technology or why it matters, but are apparently willing to gamble with their own money on a tech they don't get - then complain about daily fluctuations. Here's a word of advice - there will always be fluctuation in any stock or commodity. But it's the trend that matters. Will it be up in 10 years? 20? That's the question you should be asking yourself.

People come to this sub from off the street then act like they're entitled to share their completely ill-informed dismissive opinions amongst people who are actually ahead of the curve and understand the tech (people who have known about bitcoin and believed in it, and understood it, since you could buy one for $4).

So before you go spreading FUD, ask yourself, do I actually have even the first idea of what I'm talking about? Am I the dunning Kruger effect?

BTC is not a ""gamble"". A gamble is when you roll a dice and bet on the outcome. BTC is an unprecedented solution to the inequities and abuse of power by governments and the financial industry. It's a disruptive technology designed to give the power back to the people and away from banks. It's as much a political statement as it is a tech startup. It's the difference between over regulated taxi industries and Uber.

"the answer to your question is this - it starts with investment. after the huge gains, everyone wants in. Eventually, everyone owns bitcoin - and once that happens, no one wants a taxable event by converting it into dollars. So there's demand for people to spend their bitcoin directly. Additionally, as the price of bitcoin keeps rising, theres a high demand for crypto assets, so businesses will readily accept bitcoin payments as the potential for growth is so much higher than inflationary fiat.

&#x200B;

tl;dr: price goes up. people buy. people want to spend in btc to avoid tax. businesses want btc as its seen as a more valuable, stable growth based currency.

&#x200B;

also we're forgetting the use cases of overseas travel and online spending. plus much of the developed world. also not to forget the fact it will naturally gain in value every year - making it a much more attractive way to store your money than fiat for the everyday person (once the price stabilises due to enough people being invested and enough confidence).

&#x200B;

fiat only works because there's no alternative. and because theres no alternative, governments are able to take advantage of their monopoly to print more, or through corruption allow banks to print money. either way it costs the every man to the gain of the fat cats.

"Are you sure you aren't just a pushover?

Twice is enough to be a coincidence, more and there's a pattern from which you have to derive the common constants. The common constants are generally the root of the pattern.

If I bake 20 different cakes with 20 different recipes, but ice all of them with dogshit, if people don't like the end product, I can't make the assumption that there's something wrong with the recipes. I have to conclude that it's the dogshit ruining the cakes.

It's probably best to have a long hard think about the dogshit rather than the cake recipes.";2;1;False;pg3crypto;etceu21;BTC at 12k!;capu01;https://i.imgflip.com/3574g2.jpg

"Dudes are obsessed with preying on infinitely forgiving mother wannabees - this is why some dudes grow anti-social, because the fuck heads in their life are vampires and succubuses, feasting on their flesh.

Womens tend to be like 'fun times is good time', work be for losers - spend now, thank me later. Womens tend to be like 'joy joy joy, work is an evil concept created by the monolithic powers that be, the real work is destroying work!'

Loser dudes self-wallow, loser womens over-consume.

Put them together, and you have a family.

The better outcome, IMHO, is for men to fight men for production value, and womens to fight womens for building better people.

Generically, womens are better healers and people makers, then men, but men make adults and shape worlds: and it is best this way.

A quote from the article:
> While a fund manager may outperform for a year or two, the outperformance does not persist. After 10 years, 85 percent of large cap funds underperformed the S&P 500, and after 15 years, nearly 92 percent are trailing the index.
