"You can, but if you do it to someone holding fiat, the best you can hope for is usually a small amount of cash. if they're using a bank, maybe walk them to an ATM and take out a few grand, tops. What else can a thief do, make you put a wire transfer through? It could be traced, and it could take days to go through, and reversed in the meantime (unless you've been kidnapped for days or a loved one is being held hostage, in which case you've got bigger problems).

With crypto, you can set up a wallet on a burner phone, force someone to instantly transact thousands, hundreds of thousands, or even millions to your wallet and distribute the sum to different wallets, putting it through heightened anonymity systems like Monero, etc. Can't be reversed, very difficult to trace (impossible really if it's planned well), and there's no third party that will intervene in the transaction.

"Are people not seeing that this is all a massively blatant crypto manipulation pump (mid nov - mid dec) and dump (mid dec - mid feb) being done by institutional money? The created dip isn't over just yet (~10 more days) while the big money is buying all the way down to load up as much as they can during the dip they are creating (Mid Dec - Mid Feb, coordinated dumps + FUD) using the money they got from pumping the market and selling at the top just a few weeks prior (Mid Nov - Mid Dec, coordinated pump + lack of FUD)...

Long story short this created downtrend is likely to turn around like clockwork in mid Feb (~Feb 14) and the same manipulators will ride the wave again back up, with a much larger position they then had in the past, with no additional capitol cost to them... Think chess, not checkers!

This is the part of these conspiracy theories that I don't get.... so you're saying they're causing the price drop by dumping (selling) tons of coins... but also loading up (buying) tons of coins?  Which is it?

The problem with BTC and the other crypto currencies was that their price was extremely high, due to the influx of new investors, willing to easily make money. The same investors are selling panicky when the prices started to going down, which is creating an avalanche effect on the price of BTC. The other reason of the prices going down is that the regulatory push from USA, EU and China, South Korea to regulate the market and the eventually speculative nature of Tether. So my long term prediction is that prices will continue going down, probably below 5K and then it will start stabilizing and eventually grow a bit up, but not with the same speed as it was in the past. In the meantime I predict a lot of people would have lost quite substantial amount of money trading with crypto, or just start investing in the wrong moment, which will reduce the number of new investors to the bare minimum, which on the other hand is a good thing. I remain positive about the future of the crypto currencies, but 2018 is the year we will see a lot of regulations in the market and lots of the exchanges will require full identifications of the traders in order to be allowed to trade. And which also means the government will start collecting taxes over these trades, which will make investing in crypto currencies less desirable for some people. ;1;0;False;filisterr;dttdd9i;Lesson - History of Bitcoin crashes;7uqa54;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7uqa54/lesson_history_of_bitcoin_crashes/

Put your money in assets rather than spend it.
Be patient.
Don't try to outsmart the market and think long term.
Build your own wealth.
Self-reliance, not government-reliance.

Well. Doug clearly has credentials in Poker. Tai has none and is shady about the 'top experts' he can gather. I wouldn't use the same prior on them.;1;0;False;skyphantasy;dtswoyy;We need to talk about Tai Lopez;7v7fgl;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7v7fgl/we_need_to_talk_about_tai_lopez/

I didn't say anything about Tai's course at all. I was only refuting your opinion that Doug has a 'scammy' Poker program. As for Tai, he couldn't even describe his supposed gurus in words other than 'Bitcoin crypto expert'. I doubt he can convince real deals to teach for his courses. Besides, the Princeton course on Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies is completely free with open textbooks and programming assignments, and it's not like I've mastered every detail of that course.
