"\> Bitcoin is a fiat currency just with a twist.

No, this is certainly not correct. ""Fiat"" means ""by decree."" Dollars ultimately have value because of the notion of legal tender -- the US government's policy across all branches of accepting such paper bills as payment for debt.

The specific value of the dollar relative to other goods and services or commodities is set by the market. But the reason dollars have value \*AT ALL\* is because the government says it does, by decree or ""fiat"" if you will.

No one organization or federation makes bitcoin have value because they decree it too. Bitcoin is not ""by fiat"" currency.";2;0;False;maaku7;e3o1xep;We waited for that...;94qofa;https://i.redd.it/6a7xytdds8e11.jpg

"""Fiat"" is latin for ""Let there be"" as in ""Let there be light"" (""Fiat lux""). Fiat currencies are called like this because they have value by government decree. The name of the company FIAT stands for Fabbrica Italiana Automobili Torino (Italian Automotive Factory of Turin). It was actually pretty funny that the company acknowledged the joke, they are really doing their best to look innovative. Also RIP Marchionne.

"Fiat currencies are currencies (Dollar, Euro, Pound, Yen, etc) that are not backed by a physical item. In ye olden dayes, in the US, each dollar was worth a certain amount of gold. This kept it relatively stable in value. However, as moving and buying tons of gold isn't exactly practical these days, most monies are now what they call Fiat, in that they are backed by nothing but the trust people put in them. 

The (fake) tweet is a car company making a joke about having the same name as these currencies.";45;2;False;DoughnutSpanker;e3n9l9m;We waited for that...;94qofa;https://i.redd.it/6a7xytdds8e11.jpg
