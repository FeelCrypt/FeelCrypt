"I set a Coinbase alert for <$6500 too, I'll try to remember to check in that the sky is starting to fall if/when that hits :D

$7500, which is coming up, is a huge psychological marker, so I suspect people will want to cash out then which could be the trigger for a bigger drop like we saw the first few times it hit $4k, $5k, and $6k.  $3k bounced all the way back to $1.8k too - and except for $5k they were all relatively small psychological triggers.

"I waited for the 2013 bubble to pop and bought in heavily at $2-300. 

Hoever, the total market cap was 5 billion at that time, and I realised a couple of billionares could pump it for a laugh. 

Even after a crash, this time, the market cap will be high enough it will not be easily pumped, so I'm not sure I'd speculate to the same degree. Bitcoin is also heavily mainstream now, and a crash from 10-25k would burn a lot of people, possibly to the point it wouldn't recover.
