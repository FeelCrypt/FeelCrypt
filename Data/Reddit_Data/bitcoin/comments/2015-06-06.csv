"I'm actually a far left liberal. It's kind of hilarious that you missed that.

This comment also makes no sense in response to my above statements. Do you want to post a rejoinder? Or do you just want to put yourself on display as an unhelpful member of the Reddit community. The only thing I said which was mildly controversial was using force against someone who has engaged the US military. The rest was  just a straight reading of US law, and pointing out that you need specific intent for financial crimes in the US, and good luck finding it.

Also, you know that egregious isn't an insult in and of itself, right? I am egregiously what? Or what act of mine is egregious?

You also violated about a half dozen state laws and are headed for being banned if you tell people you hope they kill themselves.

Finally, I have no idea what you think is delusional, but here's a piece of advice. When you find someone has an opinion that differs from yours, and you find they're pretty good at articulating it, you might want to try to understand what the hell they are allying about. They might not be the delusional one- especially when you can't tell the difference between a progressive, liberal Statist, and a conservative, you myopic fuck.
