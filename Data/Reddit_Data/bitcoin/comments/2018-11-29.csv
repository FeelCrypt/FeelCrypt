"crypto bubbled because there was a belief that is no longer there. The hype has properly died down, and people who invest now can see from history that they stand to lose a lot of money.

Many countries in the EU are managing debt quite alright. It's a country to country thing, so it's very hard to comment on. also, I'm pretty sure ""fiat growth"" is a made up term. It is also strange that you're talking about monetising debt and immediately devaluing it.

> How are currencies doing when priced in bitcoin over the last 10 years?

Really good, thank you?

> the one killer app for crypto is and has always been as a replacement to fiat currency, since they are both unbacked tokens that derive value from the faith that someone will accept it in trade.

While there is a certain potential here, no government on earth would back it. The question is raised however, if bitcoin is used as a currency, would it not essentially function like the gold standard? Why would we want to go back to that?

> Fiat will trend to 0 not because of a fact of science but because governments will always abuse it for political ends. This has always been true and will continue to occur.

"> ""fiat growth"" just means the increase of the money supply. What are you saying, that the money supply isn't increasing? It absolutely is and that's required systemically.

Ohhh, you mean printing money.

> What is strange? Debt will be monetized or written off eventually.

Ohh, written off. Say that then. And not both, I'm sure. Also, will it really?

> What is the alternative?

Fiat currency, the current system that is working around the world. 

> Why would you want to go back to what, pre-1971 monetary system?

That's what I'm asking you?

> Are you seriously unaware that fiat loses purchasing power continuously? The USD or GBP are like down 95%+ of their purchasing power in the last 100 years. It's a guaranteed loss long term.

Are you saying british people could afford 20 times as much tea 100 years ago? What statistics is that based on? Doesn't purchasing power grow continuously?

"Outstanding opportunity to short Bitcoin right now. At least for anyone who isn't emotionally invested on the long side. Flip this chart upside down and there wouldn't be a question that this is a prime buying spot. I'm totally selling here. 

Edit (6 days later) ; approaching the take profit target now. $4225 down through $3500. Traders are trying to push this below 3500 to run all those stops just below it. Easy 20% profit, took almost zero heat & very low risk trade for an outstanding profit. It will likely bounce off 3500 as longs attempt to defend that price. But the shorts are simply accumulating more & more. Once it drops through 3500 they will unload onto the all panic sellers for a profit. 

The thing all the bitcoin purists fail to understand is that this is a market now & will behave as such. It's price is controlled by the big fish & a you can do is follow. But they are predictable. They move price, seeking liquidity. They accumulate massive positions, moving the market as they do so. They need to find liquidity to unload their positions. The typical retail trader & investor is doing the exact opposite and becomes chum for the whales. ";1;0;False;Heph333;eaqgsnx;Those mountains;a1d0ze;https://i.redd.it/vq1mjluii6121.png

"I'm not hoping for a future blockchain to have more utility. I'm hoping for bitcoin itself to gain more utility.

&#x200B;

Forking does not inherently dilute value. I can spin up an infinite number of forks of bitcoin at any time, but they only have value if they attract users (for network effect). Despite dozens of forks of bitcoin, only b-cash diluted the value, but only very marginally. If you look at the BTC/BCH combination, BTC has 96% of the value while BCH has 4%. Considering BTC swings +/- 10% in \*a single day\*, this is nothing to be concerned about.

&#x200B;

The confusion aspect is real, but it has to do with branding not the technology. I can make a new worthless currency and call it bitcoin 2.0 and try to trick people into buying it. If I did this, I would expect the crypto community and media to reject my name as too confusing/misleading.

&#x200B;

The fact that people are allowing a forked chain with fewer users, less mining hashrate, and a fraction of the value to free load off of bitcoin's brand is baffling to me. I'm all for competition, and I'm on record supporting b-cash as an interesting side project. That being said, it is not bitcoin and should not contain ""bitcoin"" anywhere in its name.";1;0;False;YoungSh0e;eaq6clk;What happened the emphasis of spending bitcoin on this sub?;9ys0y5;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9ys0y5/what_happened_the_emphasis_of_spending_bitcoin_on/
