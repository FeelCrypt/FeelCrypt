"> I know because I Just had to sell the very last of my bitcoin to pay rent.

Thats actually a very good metric.

You can starve out other market participants and determine who is there. People that borrowed have to pay interest monthly, and you can tell who borrowed too much by filling buy order 10% away below the prior best bid. You can then wait it out further, expecting a random distribution to have unexpected life events.

Ultimately, the people without capital sell to the people with capital who never sell, and this makes the remaining amount of the asset more scarce.

You having to get out to pay rent accomplishes this as well.";1;0;False;1blockologist;du57m97;Insider tip: BTC is going to skyrocket in the next 48 hours;7x239n;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7x239n/insider_tip_btc_is_going_to_skyrocket_in_the_next/

"""distributed ledger"" is not a complicated thing to understand. It's just not a groundbreaking technology, it doesn't really disrupt any particular business. I think a lot of people who espouse faith in blockchain haven't really spent any time understanding the magnitude of cash that goes in to current ledger technology. A centralized ledger isn't particularly cumbersome or expensive for any industry (we still use computers, after all). The best use case seems to be these digital currencies which impose their own cumbersome limitations.

I wouldn't discount Buffet's business sense and lack of interest in cryptocurrency. If he saw blockchain as creating an""economic moat"" he would bother to understand it. The fact is, blockchain currently solves problems that nobody really cares about, it doesn't significantly lift any kind of financial or logistical burden that can't be solved more reliably with more traditional technology. The goalposts have been continuously moved for the significance of bitcoin. You can discount Buffet all you like but when the smartest financial leaders all agree that something isn't as groundbreaking or valuable as retail investors seem to think.... it's no particularly smart to ignore them and discount their opinion because ""they don't understand."" 

They aren't idiots. They understand money and business much better than you or I. They've lived through a lot more disruption than you or I. It rarely pays to be a contrarian.

People regularly don't know the difference between a law and a right.  Rights are things that governments can't take from you.  A right to be presumed innocent.  A right to reject self-incrimination.  A right to privacy.  A right to know what you are being accused of, and the evidence that is to be used against you in an impartial court of law, where the complainant, the state, must prove beyond reasonable doubt that you have committed a specific crime.

I break no law, and I don't have to explain myself.  I pay my taxes, and am a good citizen.  You have to gather evidence, lawfully, while also respecting my right to privacy.  That's the law.  You should learn it.  You don't get to put me under surveillance just because I might commit a crime.  You have to provide probable cause, and that requires you having existing evidence that I have committed a specific crime.

"**High-voltage direct current**

A high-voltage, direct current (HVDC) electric power transmission system (also called a power super highway or an electrical super highway) uses direct current for the bulk transmission of electrical power, in contrast with the more common alternating current (AC) systems. For long-distance transmission, HVDC systems may be less expensive and suffer lower electrical losses. For underwater power cables, HVDC avoids the heavy currents required to charge and discharge the cable capacitance each cycle. For shorter distances, the higher cost of DC conversion equipment compared to an AC system may still be justified, due to other benefits of direct current links.

That’s not really correct.  A pyramid scheme relies on the bottom to actually pay into the top, not merely work for them.  Basically, if you had to pay $10,000 to get your current job, and your boss told you that you don’t get paid, but instead go convince another 10 people to pay $10,000, and you will half of that ($50,000).

"The ""pyramid"" in pyramid scheme is not about hierarchy of authority, or who is subordinate to whom, its about how the money flows.

In a pyramid scheme the money flows from one layer to the next, with each one getting a bigger cut than the last, and the bottom-most layer getting nothing or even being in the red.

In a regular job, all the money flows directly to the top, and then part of that money flows down to all layers.

Difference being that as opposed to the pyramid scheme where you are fucked if you happen to be in the last layer before the thing keels over/before no profitability is left, (and you cant know for sure, they certainly wont tell you), and you are indebted to your boss, in a normal job you know youll get paid and you are not indebted to anyone.";1;1;False;ElysiX;du412wa;Thought I might share this in here.

"Some selectivity in composing a list of things to compare Bitcoin to is necessary. All of the listed things are technological improvements that are radically different from whatever they replace, just like Bitcoin. Different enough that most people just can't see how it could possibly be useful or desirable.

Something like HD DVD is not radically different from what it was meant to replace. Everyone who knew CDs or DVDs would've understood what it was and it's implications in under 5 minutes. HD-DVD would be a nice example to use to argue for why most altcoins, even if they're better, in some ways, than Bitcoin will fail _because_ of Bitcoin's network effects. But it doesn't work for discrediting the list in this post.

So, might you have an example of something that failed that is actually comparable to Bitcoin in how different and radical of a change it represents?

"**Concorde**

Aérospatiale/BAC Concorde () is a British-French turbojet-powered supersonic passenger jet airliner that was operated until 2003. It had a maximum speed over twice the speed of sound at Mach 2.04 (1,354 mph or 2,180 km/h at cruise altitude), with seating for 92 to 128 passengers. First flown in 1969, Concorde entered service in 1976 and continued flying for the next 27 years. It is one of only two supersonic transports to have been operated commercially; the other is the Soviet-built Tupolev Tu-144, which operated in passenger service from 1977 to 1978.

1859: How do you know the context of the statement? It is presented as ""oil drilling is a stupid idea"" not ""looking for oil and hoping it's there"" is stupid. Surely Drake had a reasonable way to see of oil might be there beyond ""lucky guesses"" (after all, he DID find oil).

1876: You can't assume that the current limitations of a technology will always be present, especially if the tech in question is new. The first guns sucked compared to bow & arrow. The first calculator sucked compared to abacus. Thus, assuming phones would never evolve was absurd.

1921: The statement had nothing to do with the small audience size, but rather that anything on the radio was not sent to ONE specific person, but anyone who got the signal. The speaker totally missed the point of the radio to begin with.

1946: Again, he said people would get tired of it - his arguement does not rely on audience size at all. Also the speaker was a movie producer... kinda the equivalent of a TV station owner today claiming people will get tired of video games.

"True, but only one of my arguments (1859) was based on the prediction being correct - and I believe that to be more likely than Drake simply having made a lucky guess to find oil. I'd argue most of these statements weren't the best - not simply because they were wrong, but because most of them didn't consider the evidence available to them at the time.

Take this quote:
“You would make a ship sail against the winds and currents by lighting a bonfire under her decks? I have no time for such nonsense.” ― Napoléon Bonaparte

Napoléon thought the concept sounded so absurd that he simply dismissed it without thinking it through all the way - it's not as though no one had ever moved an object by using heat energy before. This is why the quote doesn't highlight his finest hour, not simply him being proven wrong.

Or this quote:
""Stay away from it. It's a mirage, basically,"" - Warren Buffet on Bitcoin

His entire arguement is that Bitcoin isn't real. Except... all money isn't real. Money is like math or love - something humans made up - in this case, to make it easier to turn one type of value into another. Dollars, gold, and bitcoin only have value because we agree to say it does. So technically speaking, Buffet isn't ""wrong"". But the statement itself is stupid, especially so because we know the person who said it is smart enough to know better, and that would not change even if bitcoin fell to zero tomorrow.

"I don't see how just smartcontracts could fully fill this role. If one party disputes  the transaction between an exchange of crypto for a good or service (in the case of crypto it would be only the receiver of the good service because payments can be checked in the chain) a third party has to check the claim that a party didn't fulfill his role in the exchange/purchase of the good or service.

You buy a pair of shoes. These shoes are not the correct ones (fake, wrong size, whatever). You either have already paid or you don't release the funds from an escrow smartcontract. In the latter case you need a third party to look at the evidence by both parties to which party is in the wrong and thus who should receive funds.

A great example we have are actually the darknet markets. We see that an authority is needed to check up on disputes between vendor and buyer. 

While the buyer can proof he has the funds by placing them in escrow. Unless the product has a foolproof chip embedded a smartcontract can not check if the right product has been delivered.

"Inefficiency is on purpose. The fact that somebody has to spend energy is what makes it secure. 

The way I see it, we are in a phase where mining technology is still important (best chips win, miners have high margins). The end game is that energy is the only thing that will matter. You will have to invest energy to mine, and that is the only thing you need (as  sha256**2 chips will be as common as calculators).

> In a regular job, all the money flows directly to the top, and then part of that money flows down to all layers.

Actually, in many ""very large"" organisations, it is a lot more pyramid like, in that profit centres have their own accounts separate from the company global account and are ""paying upwards"" to the larger organisation(s) with little to no 'real' justification beyond ""they support us and give us the structure to work within"" (which itself is pretty pyramid-scheme sounding when thinking about it in that context).

This is an attempt to avoid the centralisation of management issue where a company that is doing tens of thousands of different things at once can't possibly always be reporting it in to the senior levels.  It doesn't actually work very well, but it is common in my experience (I've personally worked for 4 multinationals that have this structure).

Money btw already is a digital currency otherwise you wouldn't be able to use a credit card. Blockchain tokens will only be used when governments implement the open source code into what you call fiat money. Bitcoin community is stubborn and very conservative for a bunch of people claiming to be progressive. They are clinging onto a dinosaur version of blockchains for their dear life.

"Anyone who thinks Bitcoin hit $15,000+ from Grassroots money is delusional. Hedge funds and the FED themselves have been in Bitcoin for a long time. Ever since the collapse in 2008 the Federal Reserve had to come up with a plan for the day the dollar dies. That day is coming and we all know it. Do you think the ruling class in the financial power structure of the world is going to let the dollar collapse without a backup? Of course not.
We're moving into a digital age and digital currencies are indeed the future. Bitcoin was their test balloon. 
They need public adoption to be at an advanced stage by the time the dollar dies. We can't have a collapse and wake up the next day and introduce the world to bitcoin. 

No, we have to get them used to it, excited about it, get them ready for it. Bitcoin probably won't survive in the long run. It is an absolute atrocious form of money. It's only store of value because people think it is. But one day people will think it's not and then it won't be. It can't be a store of value without having some other utility. Every other store of value in the history of mankind has had some other utility. Be a gold real estate whatever it has to have at least two uses. Bitcoin has only one use and that's to store value. That can't continue forever.

"Is this not a good argument for why Bitcoin will succeed? Those who are involved with and champion Bitcoin are in a global minority compared to those who actively disbelieve that it will ever amount to anything worthwhile. 

A lot of ""experts"" and high-profile characters have said that 1) Bitcoin won't last, 2) it's not really money, 3) it has no intrinsic value, 4) it's too slow and 5) it uses too much electricity.

1) A vapid statement when presented on it's own, but usually given in conjunction with many or all of the others listed...

2) I love this one because it opens dialogue for what money is and what purpose it's meant to serve and that's the most dangerous thing that can happen to the established financial elite

3) After understanding the meaninglessness of the second point, this point becomes as frustrating as it is funny

They look at that crappy plywood box tv set and think thats nice but it won't catch on.

Bitcoin is still a technology in its infancy and unlike the world changing technologies that came before. 

Bitcoin has the unprecedented challenge of having to be the first major technology to grow up in the age of the internet.

The people who say Bitcoin is dying/is going to die either use reasons like other cryptos have better tech or point out the flaws like power usage and transaction verification time. What these people don't get is the masses will continue to use, support and invest in Bitcoin as long as it's apparently secure and useful (as a store of value and as a currency) and remains a positive household name. Just because Bitcoin has obvious flaws doesn't mean it's going to die. Once scarcity really comes into play after the final Bitcoin has been mined, and once we've seen significant market and infrastructure implementation, it'll take a disaster to keep Bitcoin's value from skyrocketing. It isn't going to be a fiat replacement, but something like in between gold and fiat. Bitcoin won because it was the first, it has the name, it has market cap and investors.

"There have been significant advances in bitcoin over the last few years and it will continue evolving.

Saying ""it seems like one of the worst cryptos"" without any justification makes no sense.  While there are some interesting ideas out there, nothing so far has proven itself to the level that bitcoin has in the fundamental properties that are important to the system (decentralisation, network stability/resilience, immutability, etc).

Should another technology prove useful and stable, it can almost certainly be implemented on top of (layer 1) or along side of (layer >1) bitcoin.  So far, most of the technologies that people talk about in other coins have not reached a level of maturity or been proven to be a good idea to the point that it would be of interest to implement on bitcoin.  Implementing some random idea ""because it looks cool and will make things really fast and cheap"" without examining all aspects of how it could effect the ecosystem would be disastrous.

The good thing is that - as a decentralised system - if you want to go ahead and run something else, you're more than capable of doing so.  There is literally no one that can stop you.  You can even implement whatever crap on top of bitcoin you like and run that.  If other people run it along with you, you'll have your very own fork with the features you want.

"**Survivorship bias**

Survivorship bias or survival bias is the logical error of concentrating on the people or things that made it past some selection process and overlooking those that did not, typically because of their lack of visibility. This can lead to false conclusions in several different ways. It is a form of selection bias.

Survivorship bias can lead to overly optimistic beliefs because failures are ignored, such as when companies that no longer exist are excluded from analyses of financial performance.
