Note that the above chart is a log chart whereas your examples are linear charts.  By my eyeball, most of the charts that you linked appear to have linear growth.  (except for countries like Russia that are sort of hyperinflating on their own).

Still, I wasn't arguing that the trends for the alternative metrics weren't exponential, just that it is lower exponential than is expected given the transaction chart's curve.  That difference would be partially explained by the ""artificial"" transactions.  What we really care about is ""true"" adoption and ""true"" usage statistics.
