I still trust Gavin (I highly doubt Gavin would ever lie about such a thing, or be easily fooled), and there's still nothing that categorically rules out CSW but right now there's nothing to prove CSW is connected to Satoshi's identity either, only speculation and heresay.

The mistake I'm referring to is the fact that Gavin, Jon and journalists made an announcement before CSW came forward with proof, they acted on trust and it regrettably got turned on them. Right now, even though CSW has proven nothing, there's still nothing that definitively rules him out either, all we have on both sides is speculation and heresay. It's a frustrating situation, but right now there's nothing definitive, people will just have to move on with their lives until either CSW grows some balls and provides proof, or something more definitive pops up to categorically rule out CSW.;11;1;False;ferretinjapan;d2uzy13;Gavin, we still love you for all that you do.;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4i2oms/gavin_we_still_love_you_for_all_that_you_do/

">You forget that Gavin initially said he saw CW sign a message using an early block (#0 or #1), and only got to take home the #9 signature. He witnessed more evidence than just the public one we all saw. So **perhaps he was, and still is, convinced, but with something the rest of us don't know about.**

I haven’t forgotten anything; Gavin’s purported claims just don’t seem relevant in determining that he is lying.  To determine that he is lying, all you have to realize is that as soon as Gavin learned that the public signature was a forgery, if he truly believed prior (that Wright is Satoshi), then this revelation would have made him doubt—reasonably doubt.  After all, the signature he supposedly verified was under extremely suspect circumstances (in a London hotel room chosen by Wright; on Wright’s computer; and with Wright retaining all of the “evidence”).  After learning of the forgery, no reasonable person would think it unlikely they were tricked.  But instead, Gavin lies and says he believes Wright is Satoshi “beyond a reasonable doubt.”  TWICE!

Then Electrum (the company that authors the client software purportedly used for verification) confirmed that no .asc file was even downloaded from the U.K. on the day of the supposed “verification.”  And after all this and even more time to deliberate, Gavin decides to bolster the fabrication via twitter.  Gavin is lying.  He knows damn well that Wright is not Satoshi.  These are the actions of a desperate man.

Someone else asked, **“then what is his motive?”**  This is where many are getting tripped up; it’s actually quite simple when you see it.

For some time now, Gavin has been drifting into irrelevance. And being the Bitcoin guy THE thing Gavin has to distinguish himself.  This distinction has, for the last several years, landed him the best seat in the house and a cushy job that requires little actual work. Those are surely in jeopardy if he can't pull off some miracle to make himself relevant again.  The XT fail was bad.  The Classic fail was worse.  Those failures make it clear that in time, Gavin will be completely irrelevant.

If Gavin wishes to salvage his relevance it will require something drastic.  Desperate times accordingly resulted in desperate measures.  If no one would have re-formatted the signature and searched it on the blockchain then Wright would have a lot of people believing he is Satoshi right now.  And Gavin would have a lot of people believing Satoshi whole-heartedly backs Gavin.  It’s fairly risky to hope no one will find that signature, but it’s not far-fetched that they will not.  It is definitely a “Hail Mary” type move, but Gavin has quite a bit at stake, and the agony of defeat is looming.

That is the motive.  And it perfectly and reasonably explains the behavior.  The real bitch of all of this is that it only took about 90 minutes for the fake signature to be determined a forgery.  That was not enough time for the hopeful belief that Wright is Satoshi to even propagate (people form strong biases around initial impressions).  Accordingly, before the idea could even take hold, it was debunked and Gavin was hastily forced to decide how to respond.

Had his decision simply been “Do I still believe Wright is Satoshi?” the answer would easily have been, “I have my doubts.”  But Gavin’s actual decision was “Should I stick with my story, or should I give up on regaining my relevance?”  That’s where he made the mistake.  He did not realize that sticking with his story was not a real option.  He did not realize that there was absolutely no way to still convince people.  In a hasty act of desperation he chose to stick with his lie.

">pure speculation

I've occasionally wondered the difference between ""pure"" speculation and the average run-of-the-mill speculation.  The difference between speculation and conjecture; conjecture and inference; and inference and reasonable inference.  They differ only by degrees.  But the dividing lines between those terms is blurry.  Such is the reality of facts regarding human endeavors.

Yet, while the lines are blurry, one can still be quite certain of the category of a particular assertion when it lands well away from a blurry barrier.  In this instance the following assertion is properly categorized as the *only reasonable inference*, one where reasonable people cannot differ (unless, of course, they lie due to bias):

"> Not true. The signature was examined, and Gavin after the panel discussion repeated the assertion

As I said, Gavig does not waste his time on Reddit, was not aware of this signature, and the examination of this signature came out after he made that claim, or at best around the same time. He didn't learn about it until much later in the day. We were all pretty busy with the conference.

> This is easily understood as hoax between a couple of guys

That's your understanding based on your lack of information on what was going on that day, and your bias of Gavin's character. If this was a hoax, Gavin was not in on it. Frankly, your whole theory about motive and Gavin is absurd.

"Unfortunately for you, you also have zero proof that Gavin is lying. At most you have proof that the evidence given is faulty, which doesn't automatically prove the opposite position.

Gavin said he believed  “beyond a reasonable doubt"" **before** the signature was examined. Don't forget that Gavin is generally busy and doesn't waste his time on garbage posts here. For all we know, he didn't even know about the signature debunking until later.

Gavin also said that his belief that Craig was Satoshi was based not only on the signature, but on discussion of personal matters between them that supposedly only he and Satoshi would know.

And worse, you may not even be aware of Gavin's or Craig's intended purpose in all this. It could very well have been Craig's intention from the start to really muddy the waters on this.

">Gavin said he believed “beyond a reasonable doubt"" before the signature was examined.

Not true. The signature was examined, and Gavin after the panel discussion repeated the assertion in a video interview, then further bolstered the fabrication with his Tweets.  He still maintains the view on his blog post.

>Gavin also said that his belief that Craig was Satoshi was based not only on the signature, but on discussion of personal matters between them that supposedly only he and Satoshi would know.

Doesn’t matter.  The forgery would introduce a lot more than a reasonable doubt.

>you may not even be aware of Gavin's or Craig's intended purpose in all this. It could very well have been Craig's intention from the start to really muddy the waters on this.

I try not to entertain absurdity.  I recommend you avoid the same.  This is easily understood as hoax between a couple of guys trying to get their way by hoping no one would quickly discover their forgery.

>I don't even know why this is in dispute.

Now you’re lying.  You do understand why this is in dispute.  Many people suspect others to be Satoshi—some who have definitely expressed displeasure with Gavin’s plan.  In fact, Satoshi was expressly against Gavin on Bitcointalk, when he wanted to create a competing build.  While it should not matter so much, what Satoshi would think is used as an end-all argument to settle contentious matters.  Unfortunately we can know the founder’s intent unless he presently speaks it.  Gavin was trying to forge Satoshi’s support because he has lost the community’s.

>you also have zero proof that Gavin is lying.

Incorrect.  I have clear and convincing evidence (a high standard) that Gavin is lying.  And in matters relating to human endeavor, this is “proof.”

Proof is a nuanced word.  In mathematics it means something entirely different than it does in matters regarding human affairs.  Mathematical proof is something far more concrete.  However, to prove that Wright is Satoshi is actually an matter that consists only of persuasion.  This is the nature of “legal proof.”  Had no one re-formatted the signature and discovered it on the block chain, Gavin and company would have “proven” (not in the mathematical sense) to lots of people that Wright is Satoshi.  Had days passed, before the forgery was discovered, lots of people would still be convinced that Wright is Satoshi (the whole bias from first impressions).  Indeed, some diehards are still convinced that Wright is Satoshi despite the damning forgery (for them there is “proof”).  Notwithstanding your understanding of the word proof, Gavin could have “proven” (convinced) lots of people that Wright is Satoshi if no one quickly discovered the signature.  That’s risky, but it is not far-fetched.

The bitch of it is someone discovered the forgery within 90 minutes—well before the false impression had time to propagate.  And that’s when Gavin screwed up royally.  That’s when he “proved” to everyone that he is lying.

**To determine that he is lying**, you don’t need to know what he supposedly saw, or what was said.  All you have to realize is that as soon as Gavin learned that the public signature was a forgery, if he truly believed prior (that Wright is Satoshi), then this revelation would have made him doubt—reasonably doubt. After all, the signature he supposedly verified was under extremely suspect circumstances (in a London hotel room chosen by Wright; on Wright’s computer; and with Wright retaining all of the “evidence”). After learning of the forgery, no reasonable person would think it unlikely they were tricked. But instead, Gavin lies and says he believes Wright is Satoshi “beyond a reasonable doubt.” TWICE!

Then Electrum (the company that authors the client software purportedly used for verification) confirmed that no .asc file was even downloaded from the U.K. on the day of the supposed “verification.” And after all this and even more time to deliberate, Gavin decides to bolster the fabrication via twitter. Gavin is lying. He knows damn well that Wright is not Satoshi. These are the actions of a desperate man.

**On to motive.**  This is where many are getting tripped up; it’s actually quite simple when you see it.

For some time now, Gavin has been drifting into irrelevance. And being the Bitcoin guy THE thing Gavin has to distinguish himself.  This distinction has, for the last several years, landed him the best seat in the house and a cushy job that requires little actual work. Those are surely in jeopardy if he can't pull off some miracle to make himself relevant again.  The XT fail was bad.  The Classic fail was worse.  Those failures make it clear that in time, Gavin will be completely irrelevant.

If Gavin wishes to salvage his relevance it will require something drastic.  Desperate times accordingly resulted in desperate measures.  If no one would have re-formatted the signature and searched it on the blockchain then Wright would have a lot of people believing he is Satoshi right now.  And Gavin would have a lot of people believing Satoshi whole-heartedly backs Gavin.  It’s fairly risky to hope no one will find that signature, but it’s not far-fetched that they will not.

"Gavin Andresen gets a lot of credit for Bitcoin's phenomenal growth, and he deserves it.

As a software engineer who has worked with Gavin, I know that he is the real thing.  He understands the entire Bitcoin system and core codebase, and is so familiar with it, he immediately sees flaws others miss, and knows instinctively how to move forward in a safe, incremental, yet aggressive way.

Gavin does not get enough credit for building the core team. Gavin built the team that grew bitcoin phenomenally for 3 years.  While none of his 4 appointees was famous before, each if them proved to be a latent superstar. Gavin saw their potential and chose them with a 100% success rate. Of all Satoshi's stunning accomplishments, naming Gavin to carry the torch was every bit as impressive as the rest. While the 5 of them worked together, they were amazing.

Everything changed when two of them formed a profit-seeking company, Bockstream, to develop bitcoin core. To that company, Gavin Andresen was an obstacle.

"Lol.  This thread reads like a funeral for Gavin's character.

You guys are so stupid.  **Gavin is lying his ass off.**  As soon as he knew Wright forged the signature, he experienced all the doubt any reasonable/ordinary person would have had overwhelming doubt.  Gavin lied and said he believed Wright is Satoshi ""beyond a reasonable doubt.""  TWICE!  He then bolstered the fabrication with tweets.  The truth is he knew it was a lie before his blog post.  So when he heard the news of the forgery, he didn't have to decide whether he believed or not, only whether he should keep lying or not.  In desperate haste he made the wrong choice, and now he can't easily back-peddle.  He played you fools like the fools your are.";-31;3;False;Lejitz;d2uqp1c;Gavin, we still love you for all that you do.;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4i2oms/gavin_we_still_love_you_for_all_that_you_do/

You forget that Gavin initially said he saw CW sign a message using an early block  (#0 or #1), and only got to take home the #9 signature. He witnessed more evidence than just the public one we all saw.

The timing was bad, yes. Gavin has not been using the repo in any way needing this. People think he's there for some sort of veto power, that's not how they utilize those posts. The real thing we should be saying is Gavin please write code, get more involved. He would surely be added. It's simply not true, he has ceased any involvement that requires such access.;3;0;False;;d2uvclk;Gavin, we still love you for all that you do.;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4i2oms/gavin_we_still_love_you_for_all_that_you_do/
"I vote for Gavin Andresen. He was, is and very likely will remain being the best candidate for leading the Bitcoin project. He is to the Bitcoin project what Linus Torvalds is to the Linux project. Gavin is unusual in that he prioritizes the benefit of the Bitcoin project over personal benefit. He and Satoshi are the two people who (by far) have demonstrated this the most. 

I trust Gavin both as a person and I trust his technical competence, judgement and vision. The only problem with people like Gavin is that they do not want to be the leader of a project. Ironically the people who don't even want to be leaders are also the people who would be the best leaders.

His reputation is shot, credibility in tatters. Your cult of personality has been destroyed by the power of the ego leading it. That's sad, but it is time to leave it behind and move on, no need to beat the corpse.
