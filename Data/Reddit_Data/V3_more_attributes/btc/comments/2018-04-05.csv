"It’s legal for banks because they are regulated to run fractional reserve. Not MtGox who also claimed they were not running fractional reserve, hence the fraud charges.

The other exchanges didn’t result in arrests because the owners announced them and didn’t manipulate the accounting records in order to try and cover it up. Mark did. There is no comparison.

"**Pretty Good Privacy**

Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) is an encryption program that provides cryptographic privacy and authentication for data communication. PGP is used for signing, encrypting, and decrypting texts, e-mails, files, directories, and whole disk partitions and to increase the security of e-mail communications. Phil Zimmermann developed PGP in 1991.

PGP and similar software follow the OpenPGP standard (RFC 4880) for encrypting and decrypting data.

Only the investors who grow stronger survive, the week ones die off, it could be us, holders, are the week ones we won't know, but the ones who make the independent choices while behaving cooperatively are the investors who will survive. In crypto, Holding has proven to be the most effective investment strategy, but things are always clear in hindsight. So it's not a guarantee of anything. 

Things may be changing we may need to start earning and spending bitcoin not just holding it. 

>but I was pretty much saying that people that enter in the future, will likely be less smart, which results in a higher 

There are probably many more smart people entering than me, but those with wisdom and those who cooperate can increase the value of their holdings. At the end of the day, it's about having as big a piece of the biggest pie, not just a big piece of the pie.

>because these people are weaker hands, because they are less smart,

yes, week hands are one way to look at it, but I'd use wise as opposed to smart. 

FOMO works both ways up and down, Holders could be bag holders. 

Volatility also works both ways price going up or down = volatility and a monetary unit that is 80% issue that is still to be widely addopted is going to be incredibly volatile until it has reached equilibrium.

"**Civil forfeiture in the United States**

Civil forfeiture in the United States, also called civil asset forfeiture or civil judicial forfeiture or occasionally civil seizure, is a controversial legal process in which law enforcement officers take assets from persons suspected of involvement with crime or illegal activity without necessarily charging the owners with wrongdoing. While civil procedure, as opposed to criminal procedure, generally involves a dispute between two private citizens, civil forfeiture involves a dispute between law enforcement and property such as a pile of cash or a house or a boat, such that the thing is suspected of being involved in a crime. To get back the seized property, owners must prove it was not involved in criminal activity. Sometimes it can mean a threat to seize property as well as the act of seizure itself.

Can you get money into PayPal without a bank account? I guess I was arguing that it isn’t ‘as easy’ as email since, unless your life savings is below $X, or your email provider is EXTREMELY nosy, then PayPal is certainly not as easy as email. They can and will lock funds for seeming ‘suspicious’, or if you send it to someone who may have transacted with someone else who has ever done anything suspicious.  And I would guess if either sender or receiver wasn’t linked to a bank account, or didn’t have 3 forms of ID, that would be enough to track as suspicious.

"You can understand fundamentals, but crypocurrency prices aren't, and haven't been for the last year, traded on fundamental analysis. Their traded because people believe its going to make them rich. The price that they are currently at might be inflated, might be too low, might be just right, but because of the way the market is, no one has a fucking clue. It's impossible to know what happens in 3 weeks to the price, as it is currently full of speculative investment. 

Secondly, the fact that people are fucking investing in a currency is ridiculous. If you want Bitcoin to become a dominant currency, then it would need to see serious reductions in volatility, which unfortunately will not happen if people are speculating, as there will be to many people profit taking at any given moment, and then individuals rejoining. This will lead to rises and falls as individuals dump coins and buy coins, and so unless we see a massive reduction in the investor mentaility with bitcoin, and it becomes a mentaility of lets use this as a tool to buy things, then Bitcoin will be usable as a secondary currency.

Thirdly, there is no regulation on Bitcoin at the moment, leaving any individual without massive amounts of either fiat currency or bitcoin open to people to manipulate the market for their own gain, at your own expense. And when regulation does come in, there will be a crash as those who have never heard of regulation run the fuck away. 

Finally, why on earth are you keeping all your money in one investment. No one should do that ever, even if the company has the most wonderful mapped out growth plan, which cryptocurrencies dont. Its a recipe for disaster, and effectively a gamble on the outcome of ETH skyrocketing.

edit: Didn't see your other reply, but the literature suggests, and my own calculations suggest, that Bitcoin does not correlate with stock returns, and that even it acts as a safe haven against fluctuations in other assets, meaning that its so uncorrelated, that it is likely to be safe and calm when the stock market is volatile.";4;4;False;;dwuhr3t;“If sending money globally as easily as an email doesn’t impress you, how about the ability to store your life savings in your head, then walking your family across a war-torn border to safety?” Lasher;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/89xkbs/if_sending_money_globally_as_easily_as_an_email/

"Oh fuck me. You can't answer any of my points. Volatility is only better than inflation when the price goes up. Inflation only reduces your wealth if you have your assets in places where the interest/return is less than inflation. And if your money is there, then why the fuck are you investing in cryptocurrency when you dont know basics of savings accounts?

Bitcoin is not a joke to yourself, as you said that cryptcurrency returns are correlated, therefore you should be looking at the market leader to determine what moves other cryptos make. If you disregard Bitcoin, and say that it encourages lack of knowledge, despite being the market leader, with the highest market cap by miles, then you cannot disregard in price analysis. Further, no cryptocurrency is a utility. There currencies.

Cool so tell me your prediction for Bitcoins price in 3 weeks and layout your fundamental analysis, and we can see how far off your prediction is.

Finally on your point of visa transactions, cryptocurrency will take for fucking ever to reach that point. Bitcoin processed about 400,000 transactions a day at its peak, ETH/BCH have never come close to that. The same amount of transactions happen with VISA every minute. There are so many issues with refunds, usability, volatility, and these or need to be sorted before it gets to widespread adoption, and if your talking about it replacing VISA, then you would need to replace the monetary base of the EU and USA to reach this point. Unlikely to happen. Further, if there is still the passive investment mentality that your displaying, and if its widespread like it is not, then it will never reach adoption due to volatility.

"> Volatility is better than consistant inflation (deflation) to me

There's some basic economics here.  If volatility remains high, crypto will never become a currency that people use regularly to transact value.

The deflationary nature of bitcoin is concerning from an economics perspective as a currency that is appreciating incentivises inactivity. Why spend or even invest if your value is appreciating?  It would stagnate growth in the economy.  Most economists agree that modest inflation, circa 2%, is healthy to promote growth.";0;1;False;cbeaks;dwupa77;“If sending money globally as easily as an email doesn’t impress you, how about the ability to store your life savings in your head, then walking your family across a war-torn border to safety?” Lasher;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/89xkbs/if_sending_money_globally_as_easily_as_an_email/

"No. Corda has no native cryptocurrency. It's an app platform a bit like Ethereum, so you can create coins on top by writing an app for it.

The most useful kinds of tokens for businesses are proxies for deposits of fiat held elsewhere (or are central bank balances), so Corda comes with an example ""finance"" app that implements demos of cash, commercial paper, interest rate swaps and a few other things. A cash app that can be deployed for real is more work and involves a lot of legal and regulatory setup.

You could implement a Satoshi-style limited inflation no-backing currency on Corda. I've thought about how to do it before. But I never wrote down the details anywhere.

One consequence of this is that the miner-equivalents (notaries) can charge users in any way they like. They aren't restricted to using a native token. That has pluses and minuses that we're still exploring. Perhaps in future we'll introduce a Corda-native cryptocurrency. I personally still like the idea.

From this point of view, BCH is better - it's ""fire and forget"", the likelihood of a transaction not going through is negligible.  With ETH a zero-conf really can't be trusted.

"Corda uses a similar transaction format to Bitcoin, with inputs and outputs linked by SHA2, but it doesn't use proof-of-work. As a consequence it doesn't need blocks and as a consequence of that there actually is no chain of blocks in Corda (there are chains of transactions). That's why we sometimes call it ""DLT"" for ""distributed ledger technology"" instead of a blockchain.

So in the context of Corda it doesn't make sense to ask if it scales on-chain or off-chain. The answer is you get a lot of the properties of off-chain systems (scalability, privacy etc) with the good bits of being ""on-chain"": interested parties can neutrally verify the existence and validity of transactions.

The tech white paper explains this is more detail but briefly, imagine Bitcoin running in a mode where the broadcast logic was disabled, and where nobody was finding any blocks. If someone wanted to pay you in such a network they would need your IP address, and they would send you an `inv` packet with the hash of the payment transaction. Your node would look at the inputs and discover it was missing some, so it'd do a `getdata` in response to fetch those transactions. Then it'd look at their inputs in turn and do the same thing recursively until it bottomed out the dependency graph at transactions that were found in the block chain. 

Corda works something like that. Conflict (double spend) detection is handled by clusters of nodes that run some sort of consensus algorithm between themselves and can sign with multi-sig keys. For instance you could have a cluster using PBFT or similar, with 10-20 different parties, and they'd collectively sign each transaction to assert ""there are no double spends of this transaction"".

When double spends are resolved by checking a threshold signature of a separate group of consensus-forming nodes, this has a number of useful consequences:

* No more energy-expensive mining.
* Transactions no longer need to be broadcast to everyone. They're only seen by either parties that are involved, or parties that are involved in a transaction that depends on this one. So whilst you can still end up downloading transactions that are nothing to do with you, how much this occurs depends on the connectedness of the dependency graph. For many applications that aren't coins the connectedness is quite low so this is a huge win.
* Because only the consensus group (we call these things notaries) needs to see all transactions, low powered Corda nodes can still be fully validating and useful. So scalability is a lot better.
* Transactions have finality.
* You can avoid the various annoying probabilities and race conditions that make programming with a gossip network  tricky.

It has some downsides too. Satoshi went with PoW because he wanted a consensus algorithm with unidentified participants and no join or exit procedure. Corda doesn't provide that.

Nodes in a Corda network have a long term identity key and a name. To find them you consult a directory service called the network map. It's the same as Tor in that respect. In the same way that the Tor operators can kick nodes out of their network by removing them from the directory, so too can Corda nodes be removed (or blocked from joining) by the operators of the network map.

Corda has this concept of ""zones"" which are basically like networks or alt coins in bitcoin. They're totally independent systems and because Corda is open source, anyone can create a zone with its own rules. Also each zone has its own network map. So mainnet would be a zone, testnet would be a zone, an alt-coin that only changed a few things like name/port numbers/inflation schedule would be a zone. You don't need to fork the software to create alternative zones, there's a file called the ""network parameters"" with all the things you can tweak about a network/zone without needing to edit the source code. There's also a system for evolving these parameters, and that's our equivalent of hard forks. The set of allowed notaries (which are in turn intended to be composed of mutually distrusting nodes) is set in the network map.

So this is a more structured design than Bitcoin with a more formalised notion of governance. We're setting up a zone which we hope will become the default zone for business, and the current thinking revolves around a written constitution and a Foundation-like governance process. But the details aren't announced yet.

The result of all of this is that Corda scales a lot better than Bitcoin, but for payment networks Bitcoin could scale to the required levels with a lot of work anyway without such major design changes.";21;2;False;mike_hearn;dwukmq9;AMA: Ask Mike Anything;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/89z483/ama_ask_mike_anything/

> Permissionless-like network

Agreed for the spectrum, I was thinking about achieving enough level of decentralisation in a public network, using Corda.
Make sense for the network map.
My issue was that let's say I issue tokens for an ICO (it's trendy), I would issue these tokens point to point, so there isn't transparency on what have been issued. To fix that I could implement some business logic on the BFT notaries owned by foundations (would then be validating notaries) and a SPV-like protocol to check issuance state with these notaries.
But then it would need a strong governance model (i.e to update Flows on the notaries).

I already played much with the Cash contract :)
I was just wondering about the functional long-term model to be designed (central banks tokens / consortium of banks tokens / individual banks tokens) and what it implies in a trust-less (or let's say trust a bit less) network.

>Hard forking is an implementation mechanism, not a governance mechanism. Governance is a process, and often an institution, for arriving at a decision. A hard fork is just the software event that makes it real.

A hard fork represents a devolved decision making process.

Anyone can initiate a fork.

Anyone in line with the fork accepts the upgrade.

Anyone who disagrees may opt to follow the original chain.

If enough people disagree with the fork, then the fork fails or the chain splits.

That's governance.

>I note with some alarm that Bitcoin Cash is planning a timed hard fork in just one month, with no attempt to measure support or whether people are ready or even agree. 

That's like saying ""there's going to be a vote on the new government and we don't even know if people are going to elect the guys we want.""

If people support the fork, great. If they don't, thank goodness for permissionlessness: nobody has to accept a bad plan.

Since nobody has to accept a bad plan, this helps to keep the would be planners honest.

> Multiple competing implementations is what we tried with Bitcoin XT and it didn't work.

I'd like to think that BCH is the community of people who understand why that was, and that will make all the difference, but time will tell.

By the time XT was released, someone had already renamed ""Bitcoin qt"" to ""Bitcoin Core"" to emphasize that it was the ""central repo"" of Bitcoin development. I don't remember whose idea that was, but I think it was part of a critical misunderstanding that Bitcoin needed a technical central leadership team and Core would be it.  So by the time XT arrived, it was seen as a threat to the ""benevolent, necessary technocracy"" that Core had become in the users mind.

 BCH doesn't have a reference implementation, there is no ""Core group,"" and a lot of us will fight the centralization of development tooth and nail or exit if we fail.  I think that's a very important difference.

You conclude that it's an inability to disobey authority.  I don't think that's true.  From the position of a miner, the choice is much more difficult.  Why did segwit2x die and BCH survive?  Many reasons, of course, but one of the big ones is the difficulty algorithm.  Blockchains punish people who break consensus.  They punish *everyone* when someone breaks consensus, but they punish the minority group much much harder.  If you're a miner who has $200,000 of monthly electricity bills that must be paid no matter what, you can't simply pick the side that you are philosophically in agreement with.  You *must* pick the side that pays the bills.

Bitmain was likely using these miners for months, and as they increased the difficulty, it’s become less viable to mine with gpu, this centralizing hashrate even more. 

With PoS, any small time investor could buy a few eth and throw it at a staking pool and start earning.

"> I think that's an interesting opinion too. Proof of work allows for innovation and competition. Proof of stake is basically, ""the more money you have, the more money you earn."" Please set me straight.

There are many flavors of PoS and not all of them have block rewards.  I think the inherent idea that (after initial distribution) people who have interest WITHIN the system are most interested in protecting that system has more validity than PoW.  We've seen that PoW mining can be fairly well invalidated by competing currencies just with this EDA earlier in BCH.  Adding to that, the ability to short a market and then kill a coin also erodes confidence in the idea of protecting sunk costs of hardware.

>It is my view that the BOLD action that we should have taken in 2014-15 was to say, ""ok, you guys do your small block thing and we'll do our big block thing."" Imagine if the split had happened years earlier, we wouldn't be here now I don't think.

">  Proof of stake is basically, ""the more money you have, the more money you earn."" Please set me straight.

Staking rewards are actually a pretty small part of PoS.  Smaller than block rewards and probably smaller than fee targets should be for a safe blockchain.

Think of it this way.  The entire purpose of proof of work is that we need a method of random participant selection from among the network.  The only reason we need that is because in the event of a double spend, someone, somewhere must decide between the two spends.  Since that ""someone"" could just as well be an ally of the attacker, we need to make sure it is truly random so that the attacker can't select the double spend in such a way that they screw over a recipient.

Sybil attacks complicate the entire process because you aren't dealing with ""people"" online, you're dealing with IP addresses.  Proof of work handily solves both problems for us, and more besides.  Proof of work allows us to randomly select a participant to resolve double spends, it blocks Sybil attacks by consuming real value, it binds the participants to the future valuation of the network, and it allowed for a \**relatively*\* fair early distribution of the coins.

Now compare that with a properly done PoS system.  PoS... Allows us to randomly select a participant to resolve double spends, it blocks Sybil attacks by locking up real value inside the system, and it binds the participants to the future valuation of the network at least on a shorter timespan.  It doesn't do early distribution, but we're well past that point in Crypto-Currency now anyway.  It also doesn't bind the random participant selection to *external* value, which is the one ""flaw.""

For that singular, relatively arbitrary flaw the trade off is that the entire system becomes much more efficient.  Node operation can be directly rewarded, as is needed to maintain decentralized diversity of fullnodes.  Economically this becomes better as the network rewards hodling, creating neutral or upward pressure on price, whereas mined PoW coins must be sold to cover real world costs, which creates constant downward pressure on price.  Moreover, the payouts(fees+rewards) required to prevent a 51% attack on a PoS system can be much, much lower than the payouts(fees+rewards) required to prevent a 51% attack on a PoW system, simply because staking is passive, long term, and can be observed with metrics predicting future spikes/changes in staking control.

Of course, then there's the ""long range attack"" or the ""nothing at stake"" problem.  I feel like Ethereum's solution to this is proper and extremely handy - Simply code for such a situation in advance.  It can only happen during syncing and it is extremely expensive to pull off.  In such a situation, simply stop and make the user validate which history is the false history and which is the true history through some external checking, aka, google it or go ask the buddy who told you about Ethereum.  Given the attack's massive costs and very minor potential payoff, that's more than enough to make it infeasible.

tl;dr: Staking rewards are small by design.  The interest rates are lower than what you can get on the stock markets, and can be safely set to even lower payout levels than PoW.";6;0;False;JustSomeBadAdvice;dwuu5kk;AMA: Ask Mike Anything;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/89z483/ama_ask_mike_anything/
">  Proof of stake is basically, ""the more money you have, the more money you earn""

I've always had mixed opinions about this.  I currently favor POW because it's been time tested but I do have slight doubts as to whether POW solves this problem better than a solid POS design (in the very long run).

Here's my reasoning.  Mining hardware continues to become more expensive over time.  In the long run, there will be little direct incentive for mining hardware manufacturers to actually sell their mining hardware to consumers because it will be more profitable for them to run it themselves.  Once that's the case, ""mining"" (making money) will only be accessible to those that already have lots of money. 

In some ways it seems like POS algos would at worst simply deliver the same outcome as POW except 20 years early.  Obviously this excludes coins that are willing to fork their POW algo in response to an ASIC being created for their coin.

That being said, I do strongly believe that POW is the absolute fairest and most effective way to widely distribute a coin.";8;3;False;alwaysAn0n;dwutnxe;AMA: Ask Mike Anything;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/89z483/ama_ask_mike_anything/

* It still uses reddit to coordinate the community.
* There is no formalised governance mechanism. Old Bitcoin used ""rule by obscure IRC chats between Core devs"" and the different Cash devs coordinate .... how?
* It still uses proof of work and miners still don't care about the health of the network.
* The community still appears somewhat opposed the idea of voting in any kind of formalised governance procedure (e.g. ABC fork is not waiting to see if miners agree, or if users agree, they just picked a time and went for it).

I don't really hang out here anymore so I don't know if other problematic aspects remain ... from a quick search over the forums it seems people don't use terms like ""rule by math"" anymore, which is good. I'm not saying there's been no improvement.

The alternative Cash adopted of simply forking the entire ledger permanently, abandoning the brand name, the currency symbol,  the forums, the wallets, the exchanges, *all* the infrastructure was  - at the time - considered inconceivable. It wasn't even suggested.

The community lost a lot in the Cash split. I realise it may seem like a victory of sorts but in effect the big blockers abandoned everything except the code.

"To whatever authority presented itself. In Bitcoin there is no state. So instead, the core developers became the authority.

I don't know if you were around back then, but there were a few moments that crystallised this for me.

The first was when we (myself and Gavin) launched Bitcoin XT. This made the news and there was a TV segment on Bloomberg. I was speaking at a conference in Sweden at the time so I couldn't take part and wasn't sure I wanted to anyway. Instead they ended up with a Core supporter on their talking heads panel. The main reason cited by the Core supporter for why he was opposed to Bitcoin XT was that ""the Core developers have PhDs and neither Mike nor Gavin do"". In fact the people they were referring to had PhDs in irrelevant subjects like computer graphics, and none had any experience of scaling consumer online services - whereas via Google I had plenty. But Google doesn't award PhDs so the value of that experience was zeroed out.

This exchange sums up the mentality many had at the time: Bitcoin is *complex*, therefore it can only be understood by *experts*, therefore I should obey the instructions of experts even if they may superficially appear to be nonsense. But I am *not* an expert so how can I decide who is or is not an expert? I must rely on *proxies*, proxies like academic credentials, or whether their ideas sound clever when they speak, or whether other people who seem to be experts are agreeing with them.

These signals are all heuristics and are all trivially gamed by people who understand psychology. Some people may remember the moment when suddenly lots of small blockers started calling themselves Dr This and Dr That. They had always had PhDs but never felt the need to use their titles before, but suddenly they all started doing so. You will also remember the loud insistence that ""consensus"" mattered and that bypassing the ""consensus of experts"" was a nasty trick that Gavin and I were trying to do, because we were in the minority (no citation offered). 

W.R.T. the miners specifically I called some of them via Skype before I decided to leave. One or two refused point blank to talk to me. One miner said he supported me, but couldn't be seen to do so in case it hurt the price. Another conversation went like this:

> Miner: ""We agree the block size should be raised and we agree Core is not going to do so.""
>
> Me: ""Great! So when will you start running XT?""
>
> Miner: ""We aren't going to run XT.""
>
> Me: ""Er, but you just said you agree with our policies and don't think Core will come around.""
>
> Miner: ""Yes, we agree that you are right, but we will never run anything except Core. To do that would be to leave the consensus.""
>
> Me: ""So - if everyone thinks like you do, and refuses to run anything except Core, then the maintainer of Core is effectively the CEO of Bitcoin. So what makes Bitcoin different to PayPal? How is that decentralised""

There was a long silence at this point as if the miner had never considered this before. And eventually he just said, ""We can't run XT, that'd be crazy. We will wait for Core to change their minds.""

In hindsight I wonder if it was so hard to predict. Nobody *did* predict it so in some trivial sense it was hard.

The thing is: nothing changed about the quality of it being divorced from one state. That has been the case since 2009. Same with people speculating on it. That too has happened since it first gained value. But the one thing that *did* change was the *quality* of the p2p system. It has degraded. So the only saving grace to counter this is the fact that the media hype and word of mouth has brought in more people than the degraded state of the system lost. 

To put it another way: Where would we be today if the p2p system's performance was not a degrading factor? Even higher, I would imagine.

">Bitcoin-Qt was *the* implementation back then too. It was actually Satoshi who was opposed to any alternative implementations. He felt that it would never be necessary.

I was hoping you'd touch on that.

>The renaming from Bitcoin-Qt to Bitcoin Core was my idea. Or at least I proposed the name ""Core"". Perhaps ironic in hindsight. But Bitcoin-Qt wasn't a very descriptive name, was it? 

LoL I didn't mean to throw you under the bus.

I think at that time you and others were operating under the idea that ""the team defines the coin,"" and the problem to be solved was how to create a decentralized ""government"" to manage the team.

I think what we've learned since then is that this was a mistake. 

I think we've learned that teams are like political parties. None has a monopoly on good ideas, and that they propose but the constituency disposes.

Bitcoin BTC bears a strong political resemblance to any single-party state - or better, to a sham multiparty state, in that other parties are tolerated as long as they never threaten the power monopoly which defines the consensus rules.

So trying to overlay ""governance"" on a single party state is analogous to trying to make the Communist Party of China more representative of the people's will: good motive but fundamentally the system isn't designed to do that.  What the single party system is fundamentally designed to do is prevent opposition.

BCH governance is therefore more like Swiss cantons, in that there are many teams, and the community values the diversity they bring, yet all teams have an incentive to try to work together in as far as possible.

Read Vitalik Buterin's blog. He writes extensively and clearly about these topics. Some alt coins have tried delegated voting. The problem is that most voters are not that engaged. Swiss referendums have quite low turnout relative to most votes, but there is a culture here in which citizens feel a responsibility to participate, so that puts a floor on how low participation can drop.

"Yeah. That seems very tight.

I don't have a good answer for you. I'd suggest measuring upgrade rates via a network crawl and block header flags.

The way Corda does this is as follows. When a hard fork equivalent is scheduled (change to the network parameters file) a new version of that file is signed and published in a well known location polled over HTTP. Corda itself doesn't use HTTP, it uses a binary P2P protocol like Bitcoin does, but serving a few control files over HTTP like this means they can be protected by CDNs like Cloudflare or Akamai.

The new file contains a date at which it will take effect. So in that sense it's like what ABC is doing. *But* with a key difference: there is an explicit RPC to accept the new parameters (rules), and nodes advertise which parameters they have accepted. So the people organising the hard fork can watch to see if people are accepting the new parameters or not. If they aren't accepting it quickly enough the date can be pushed back. It's a lot more dynamic than when the date is fully hard coded.

"From an Austrian perspective, ""utility"" and ""value"" are not objective qualities that one should calculate or that should give measurable absolute values, but subjective considerations of each individual who makes economic calculations.

Jesús Huerta de Soto, a Spanish economic theorist, comments in his book ""*Socialism, economic calculation and entreprenerurship*"" [*] on this subject that value and utility are almost synonymous, and that they are degrees of importance that we give to our objetives and means. 

With this in mind, one may intuit that some individuals see a utility in bch, which is to function as money and a means to economic and political liberation, while others may see it as a means to obtain low-risk profit, and third parties may see it only as an intermediary between two fiat currencies (to bring purchasing value to their family in an exchange-controlled country), and all of them are truly part of *bitcoin cash's utility*, even though it is, in essence, primarily a medium of exchange.

>But markets are not 100% efficient

From my perspective, the market is efficient. The view that it is inefficient may have to do with believing in the idea of states of equilibrium, which do not exist (but are still defended by technocrats). The market is a dynamic process that allows us to overcome uncoordinations as they are discovered, and where not all participants are well informed (in fact, it is impossible for them to know all the data, even though they may know the data they need for their individual economic calculations), but it is constantly being adapted.

I think that's an interesting opinion too.  Proof of work allows for innovation and competition. Proof of stake is basically, ""the more money you have, the more money you earn."" Please set me straight.

>* a tyranny of whoever could impose their will the most aggressively.

I have an opinion on that too :)

Unfortunately when the aggressors showed up, we attempted to take them on head-on (ie XT) instead of simply splitting the currency early and going our separate ways. Back then there was an insane amount of FUD surrounding a coin split, with some people asserting it was ""impossible"" or that it would definitely, absolutely devalue the coin. Since then we've have two major coin splits (Ethereum & Bitcoin) and the data is clear: when a community is sufficiently divided, splitting the coin is an economically efficient, win-win outcome that raises the value of the entire ecosystem.

It is my view that the BOLD action that we should have taken in 2014-15 was to say, ""ok, you guys do your small block thing and we'll do our big block thing."" Imagine if the split had happened years earlier, we wouldn't be here now I don't think.

"It has no native cryptocurrency so there is no ICO.

Corda is a system and not a coin, so it is not tradeable on exchanges.

It's designed to be as decentralised as possible without sacrificing the other requirements that industrial and financial users need. For example, all business-to-business transactions take place between identified entities, so every Corda node has an identity issued by some ""authority"". This authority can be compound, and the ""identity"" can be e.g. a random number, a reddit username or whatever else, but for the Corda network we are creating it's legal name - because that's what exists in the heads of the business users we are building it for. That introduces some centralisation, but it's not very much (the authority here doesn't see your transactions, or know what apps you run, or control your business activity) and it's worth it to get other things.

If you look at the direction the web is going, where SSL is becoming near mandatory, then we can see that the web and Corda will end up in very similar places with respect to the level of decentralisation. So if you are happy with the web you should be happy with Corda.

Still. It is difficult to make a direct comparison of decentralisation until our network is up and running. The primary bottleneck is the consensus mechanism in any DLT/blockchain system. Corda is un-opinionated about what algorithm you should use here because there is, as of 2018, no one-size-fits-all solution unfortunately. 

One difficulty in this space is that decentralisation usually costs performance and many customers have heard all about how ""blockchains don't scale"" (gee, thanks Core) and insist on a system that can go at arbitrary but very high speeds before they will consider it. The usual bar is 1000 transactions per second and if you can't do that you won't be considered. There are BFT algorithms that can go that fast, but BFT consensus was an area that received very little attention before Bitcoin, so some of them aren't open source and others are immature. We have an implementation using the BFT-SMaRT library in the Corda git repository, but some initial customers want speed and don't care much about decentralisation, others want decentralisation and are willing to sacrifice performance. Corda can do both, but to do both in the same network, to the same level of robustness and production maturity, is an interesting challenge.

Figuring out how to accommodate these divergent needs is a part of my job.";12;1;False;mike_hearn;dwurowk;AMA: Ask Mike Anything;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/89z483/ama_ask_mike_anything/
"*edit: just to clarify, I don't think NSA backdoors have been found in Intel CPUs, can you link me to a document about that please*

Good question.

Mostly it's because SGX is a hardware feature. Let's imagine you work at Intel and want to backdoor Corda. And let's imagine that you are the CEO and can somehow pressure any employee into silence, such that a vast internal conspiracy never comes to light.

What can you do?

Well, you already shipped lots of chips and they're running inside boxes inside cages inside datacenters that have mantraps and security cameras all over them. So you can't affect the existing hardware.

Pre-existing back doors are hard to use. You don't have direct network access to the machines. And if you did hack your way through and then deploy some master backdoor, you'd leave evidence that someone would find the moment they realised they'd been defrauded. It'd be prima-facie evidence that Intel was compromised.

You could sign a non-existent CPU key and claim it's a real piece of hardware. OK. But now you have to get your fake chip onto the Corda network. So let's say you rock up to a zone operator and ask to be a member. I'm sure they'd say yes - why not! They'd love to have Intel doing business using Corda in their zone.

But. There is a critical feature that matters here. Corda does not use a gossip network. Therefore merely joining a zone does *not* grant you access to any data. To see transaction data you must convince someone else to send it to you. And they will only send it to you if you have a legitimate business reason to know (this is encoded in the form of flow logic). You might learn some random transactions that are dependencies of legitimate payments to Intel for e.g. CPU shipments. But those will be largely random transactions, and it won't be very much data. You probably don't care about small quantities of random data about random firms. Certainly, Barclays will not be sending you transactions related to a massive FX swap they did yesterday because Intel is not a financial firm. So this attack yields little to nothing of any value, yet would have massive reputational cost and due to the number of people that would have to collaborate inside Intel to pull it off, would have a large risk of leaking. 

Incentives, incentives. SGX isn't perfect - life is full of tradeoffs, and I'd love to move to zero knowledge proofs once the technology has developed further. But Intel backdooring Corda is an extremely unlikely scenario today for the above reasons. We'll manage fine.

"> It's tempting to think that what happened was a freak one-off occurrence, but I don't think it was.

There is a pretty major difference between now and 2014 though. At the time, Bitcoin was (effectively) the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. If you wanted to be involved, you really had to be involved with Bitcoin.

People were (very) afraid of what might happen if the Bitcoin community split. Altcoins were mostly seen as a testbed for new Bitcoin features. Talk of ""if an altcoin implemented something useful, Bitcoin could just roll it into the next release"" was extremely common.

That was then. Now, people are not afraid to buck the trend by forking their own coin. In fact they're economically incentivized to do so.

In 2018, the playing field is much more level than it's ever been. Nobody gets to be the king of the development castle anymore. That's the big difference between now and then. The sense of unity that we once felt has been shattered. Most of us understand the downsides to this model, but one of the major upsides is that it has become exceptionally hard for the horrible events of the past from having that same level of impact as it did when everybody was under the same roof.

"Kotlin is very nice and has worked out well for us. I took a risk by using it because when Corda started, Kotlin hadn't released v1.0 but in the end the bet paid off.

You don't have to rewrite Java codebases. IntelliJ has a conversion tool that can rewrite Java into Kotlin, and it's a very high quality conversion, the highest I ever saw. Not just comments and formatting are preserved but common Java patterns are rewritten into the equivalent Kotlin idioms.

So you could just feed bitcoinj through that tool and you'd get nice Kotlin out.

"> What do you think about 10 minutes block interval in BCH - should it be lowered a bit (2.5 minutes), changed radically (like ETH/GHOST) or left alone?

My name is not Mike, but still I have a strong opinion on this :-)

We've seen capacity bottle necks in the ETH network, the so-called ""uncle rate"", which is sort of equivalent with ""orphan rate"" in BTC, has been as high as 30%.  That's terrible - this is the sort of problem Core has been warning so much about all the time.  BCH can handle much more traffic than ETH, for two reasons - one is all the optimizations that have gone into Bitcoin Unlimited and Bitcoin Core over the last few years, the other reason is the 10 minute target block interval vs 15 seconds for Ethereum.  So ... better keep those ten minutes there!

Within the PoW framework, 15 seconds just doesn't scale.  And still, 15 seconds is quite far from ""immediate"", for short block intervals to be useful i.e. for the cash register at a busy super market the interval can't be much more than a second.  2.5 minutes too ... it's just no point as I see it.  And if there should be a network split lasting for several minutes, you still need to wait X minutes to be safe against that ... no matter on the block intervals.

Without PoW, one can probably forgo the notion of blocks at all - such as Corda does - but within PoW 10 minute block intervals is probably quite OK.  We still have zero-conf - which for all practical purposes are much safer than credit card transactions.  That is, all until some selfish miners decides to do RBF on their mining nodes.

"Yes, I'm afraid I think there's a lot to do and that's one reason I agreed to do this. Some things are being overlooked. If history repeated itself that would be a crying shame.

Hard forking is an implementation mechanism, not a governance mechanism. Governance is a process, and often an institution, for arriving at a decision. A hard fork is just the software event that makes it real.

I note with some alarm that Bitcoin Cash is planning a timed hard fork in just one month, with no attempt to measure support or whether people are ready or even agree. The content is not going to controversial in this community now, but a lot of organisations would find it hard to schedule and test a software upgrade on one month's notice. There's a risk that miners who do upgrade will be split onto a minority chain by accident even if everyone intends to upgrade, and have to roll back, making them even more conservative than they already are.

Governance was one of the causes of the split and so needs the most analysis and change. But I'm afraid I'm not seeing that at the moment. Multiple competing implementations is what we tried with Bitcoin XT and it didn't work. Ultimately the internet is a lawless place, and a sufficiently committed group will always be able to wipe out any nodes they disagree with to prevent people from expressing their opinions. Formalised governance mechanisms can help avoid this by coordinating a group decision in ways that can't be so trivially attacked, and if you look at Ethereum, they have the Ethereum Foundation and other ways to do it. I think that would help a lot.

"Thanks! Yeah, Corda is a fun project!

The Corda blog is useful: https://medium.com/corda

The white paper is a bit stale. It has a few sections we haven't implemented. We'd like to implement them in future, so that's sort of a roadmap.

Truth is the project is huge, and we're exploring uncharted waters. So there are a lot of sub-roadmaps but not a single unified committed-to roadmap. Most of my TODO list these days consists of writing documents and blog posts explaining the roadmap and what we're doing.

But at the moment we're working on a really fast, stable and production-ready enterprise node. That was something Bitcoin always lacked. Companies like Coinbase invariably write their own node because Core/Qt/etc couldn't scale well (in particular their wallet didn't scale well). 

We're also setting up a shared network that can run many apps. That doesn't sound special but to make it clear how far most of the enterprise blockchain space has wandered from Satoshi's original thinking, our competitors don't even think about having a unified network at all!

"This is a tough one.

My view is that Bitcoin Cash strongly resembles the Bitcoin community of 2014. This is not good. That experiment was tried and it didn't work. It's tempting to think that what happened was a freak one-off occurrence, but I don't think it was. I think it was inevitable given the structure and psychological profile of the community at the time. So just trying to ""get back on track"" as I see it, is nowhere near radical enough.

If I could get one message across to you in this session it's this: **be bold**. Be willing to accept that what happened was not just bad luck. Liberate yourselves from just proceeding along the path Satoshi imagined and be willing to think radical, even heretical thoughts.

Here are some questions to reflect on as a community together:

* Does Bitcoin need to use Script? If it swapped out the VM and scripting system for something better, would it still be Bitcoin?
* Does Bitcoin need to use proof-of-work? If it stopped using proof-of-work one day, would it still be Bitcoin? The Ethereum guys already answered this question and are making plans to abandon it.
* Does Bitcoin need to use its current protocol at all? If *all* the technical aspects of Bitcoin changed, leaving *only* the monetary policy and existing coin balances, would it still be Bitcoin?

and

* Does Bitcoin need a Foundation or some other form of formalised governance? We tried to make one years ago and it failed due to a mix of rum characters and opposition from people who felt it was ""centralisation"", who maybe didn't realise that the alternative was not structurelessness but rather a tyranny of whoever could impose their will the most aggressively.

"No. The causes were complex and essentially psychological. Let's say that the miners didn't behave in the way they should, and nor did most of the community, and that left an opening that a small minority of developers were able to exploit to take it over.

In such a situation, who is at fault? Was the problem the weakness of the community? Or those who exploited it? Or both?

The most critical problem for cryptocurrency in general is that Bitcoin's design rests on three assumptions that have been invalidated:

1. The price of the currency will be proportional to utility.
2. Miners are economically rational actors who will maximise utility because they want to maximise the price.
3. The other participants in the system are also economically rational and will evaluate decisions based on what's best for the long term.

In fact the price went up even as the utility of the system collapsed, due to any utility signal being swamped by speculative capital, and miners turned out to be economically irrational - their primary desire was to follow orders, not maximise their long term returns. I spent *significant* amounts of time trying to persuade miners to raise the block size limit towards the end of 2015 and they refused to do so because they were terrified of anything that might be perceived as disobedience to authority. We can debate what the cause of that is - at the time I wondered if it was related to China being a communist dictatorship - but ultimately western miners were not much better.

To understand the root causes of all this you must read Sowell. It isn't optional. ""A Conflict Of Visions"" explains why societies split into two camps that fight each other, again and again. We normally recognise this in the context of national politics as left wing vs right wing, but in the Bitcoin community this same conflict arose as Big vs Small Blockers, in Ethereum as Classic vs Original, in Russia as Red vs White, and in the UK in recent years it has been Leave vs Remain. All these conflicts are typified by the same characteristics:

* Bitter, enduring conflicts between two opposing camps of roughly equal size who can never make up.
* Very different attitudes towards perceived experts, intellectuals, towards academic qualifications etc.
* A win-at-any-cost mentality by one of the camps.
* Different views on the validity of the preferences of the majority / ""will of the people"" etc.

The reason they are so similar is because they share the same root cause, a root cause that traces to a disagreement about the span of human nature. Societies split into two camps because ultimately the underlying disagreement is over a unidimensional variable, so disagreement runs along a 1-dimension spectrum.

These conflicts cannot be avoided but they can be contained and channelled. If the Bitcoin community doesn't establish systems for containing this conflict it will arise again over some issue that appears superficially different to the block size debate, but underneath looks much the same.";119;15;False;mike_hearn;dwuntr8;AMA: Ask Mike Anything;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/89z483/ama_ask_mike_anything/

4. Is there a place or link we can check out the Corda roadmap? What's planned, what's coming... How can we best keep our finger on the pulse of that project?

Thanks again. I'll be reading through your responses across the board, and a much more thorough look through your whitepaper :)

"Hi Mike! Firstly I want to thank you for all the work you did on Bitcoin during the first years. I'm sorry for the way the community treated you and good luck with your future projects!

My question... in your article you wrote this:

> Why has the capacity limit not been raised? Because the block chain is controlled by Chinese miners, just two of whom control more than 50% of the hash power. At a recent conference over 95% of hashing power was controlled by a handful of guys sitting on a single stage. The miners are not allowing the block chain to grow.

It seems the miners are mostly supportive of Bitcoin Cash (with the exception of Slushpool) and openly write positive things about it. It seems to only be Bitcoin Core / Blockstream who are against it.

Looking back now, do you think that you think that you may have given too much of the blame to the miners and not enough blame to the Bitcoin Core team?";49;1;False;playfulexistence;dwukwpx;AMA: Ask Mike Anything;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/89z483/ama_ask_mike_anything/
"> Does Bitcoin need to use proof-of-work?

I agree with Andreas that we need at least one PoW-chain on Earth (in practice no one is able to stop it anyway). Commitment of energy immediately activates game-theoretical defense of chain's immutability. Simply put: **It costs, but no one can erase, unpredictably inflate or suspend my money, thus, my economical freedom**.

"Yes. It's easy to do a permissionless network on top of Corda. Just release the private root authority signing key to the world :-) 

You'd have a few problems if you did that but they are the same problems Bitcoin faces. People could duplicate identities. Under the hood Corda uses public keys to identify entities, just like Bitcoin, but *people* don't. You can't memorise 256 bit points on an elliptic curve, at least not without training in memory techniques like Roman Room. That's why we did BIP 70, so you could prove ownership of a Bitcoin address in a reliable and secure way. If BIP 70 had been widely adopted by the community it would have avoided [this 1.8 million dollar hack](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitpay-hacked-for-over-18-million-in-bitcoins).

Another problem is how to decide what the network parameters are. In Corda zones the answer is, the signing authority for the zone signs a new parameter ""epoch"". And how do they decide what to sign - well, for the main Corda network it's through a classical governance process. If you released the signing key anyone could sign and then it'd be up to individuals to convince other individuals to install the parameters into their node - just like upgrading to a new Bitcoin node to accept a hard fork.

The hard part is the network map. All the Corda APIs work in terms of identities. You don't use broadcast in Corda, instead you send data directly point to point. It gives better privacy for obvious reasons but you need some notion of identity to do that, even if it's just IP address. Corda is open source though. You could create a Bitcoin style `addr` broadcast mechanism to compile network maps.

Note that you can be decentralised without a Bitcoin style network. It's a spectrum. Is the web decentralised? Is email? They both rely on DNS. What about Tor? They have a cabal of seven developers who can kick users out of the network.

It's a subtle issue.

> What are you thoughts about Corda nodes (banks) issuing FIAT tokens, opposed to central banks ? It would then produce non-fongible tokens right, as we need to trust the issuing bank ?

My thoughts are that this is the first CorDapp ever written (by me). Check out the app here:

"Good to think bold, but bad to have lingering Blockstream Syndrome about it by falling for all the canards Core raised in its scorched earth attempt to maintain power. Core tried to paint a picture of a very fragile and limited Bitcoin, and that Bitcoin was merely a small evolutionary step from what came before. This was the cue for altcoin mania as well as the impulse never to leave the warm comfortable spot under the wing of Core ""experts"" and their ""full validating nodes"" (that don't validate blocks and aren't nodes). 

**Think boldly and consider that maybe Bitcoin can do it all essentially as it was originally designed.** Bitcoin was no evolutionary random lucky minimum-viable combo of older tech, but a very deliberately designed stroke of genius by someone who understood a great many things and had a far-reaching vision that merely got clouded and distorted little by little by the machinations of latecoming status-seekers, and these people have now been forked away in a remarkably clean sweep.";4;0;False;ForkiusMaximus;dwv5cww;AMA: Ask Mike Anything;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/89z483/ama_ask_mike_anything/

"Nodes are all fully validating in Corda. If you receive a transaction your node downloads the entire dependency graph and runs the contract code (scripts) for every transaction, checking all the signatures along the way. So you're sure the final result is a valid transaction.

Now there may be a double spend, but that's what the notary signatures tell you. If you trust that group of consensus forming nodes (notary) - and we hope you do because that group is probably using a BFT algorithm, so some of them can be malicious and the result is still correct - then you get the same guarantees as Bitcoin full nodes provide.

This may seem initially quite different to Bitcoin but it's actually not. In Bitcoin if you don't trust the miners collectively then you cannot rule out the existence of double spends that were re-org'd out of the chain (51% attack). And although in theory proof-of-work scales better than most BFT algorithms do, in practice due to ASICs and China what we see is that it takes so few corrupt miners to break proof-of-work that in reality almost any BFT group will be stronger.

So in this way you can get a system that's actually more decentralised than Bitcoin mining is, which is surprising, but there it is.";21;6;False;mike_hearn;dwulflp;AMA: Ask Mike Anything;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/89z483/ama_ask_mike_anything/

"There is so much to consider on this subject that I almost feel like it could fill an entire book.

One salient observation I noticed from within the Core camp is that they succeeded in polarizing the discussion so much that anybody who wasn't in their pathologically crazy small-block was suddenly a ""big blocker"". To them BIP 101 was the same as BIP 109 was the same as BIP100 was the same as Bitcoin Unlimited emergent consensus was the same as even (hilariously!) segwit 2x (which was literally the HK agreement they themselves pushed!).
