"I put BTC as NK for a couple reasons, one the rampant censorship and attacks against BCH, which is more akin to NK's treatment of its opponents. Secondly because Kim is fatter than his SK counterpart, much as BTC is bigger in price. Third because of the widespread belief that the Core devs are bad actors in how they have handled the chain split and demonize all who don't fall in line behind them, as well as the rampant DDOS of nodes that tried to run other implementations in the past.

Sure anyone with BTC sentiment is going to disagree with which is which, but that can't be avoided.

"Jesus Christ man - what are you so rabid about? You don't have to be so fearful - just buy some BCH to hedge your bets.  The best way to protest BCH is basically not supporting it financially.

You could be doing almost anything that is more worthwhile than this.  

Spend your time to improve BTC adoption - that's the way to beat BCH.  Coming here and acting like an angry teenager just gives the impression that ""the other side"" really has nothing left but trolling.

But I understand its a bit tough since BTC has crippled the ability to build anything useful on top of it.

"**Dollar**

Dollar (often represented by the dollar sign $) is the name of more than twenty currencies, including those of Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Jamaica, Liberia, Namibia, New Zealand, Singapore, Taiwan, and the United States. The U.S. dollar is the official currency of East Timor, Ecuador, El Salvador, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, Palau, the Caribbean Netherlands, and for banknotes, Panama. Generally, one dollar is divided into one hundred cents.
