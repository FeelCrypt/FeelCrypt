"Yeah, when it was happening I almost thought ""Maybe this will spur people on to start considering political implications more"", but that's backfired. Or it looks that way.

"Glad you've cottoned onto that anyway - it's demoralising once you realise it, but the earlier the better. I'd been talking to my parents about dirty politics for years and they couldn't understand why I was so distrustful, figured it was youthful naiveté - until 2008 happened and their pensions got a 60% haircut, taxes got hiked and their property value halved.

They still preferred voting for ""safe"" options.

The whole country wants deep drastic change. Thats part of how obama got elected. Burn it all down was much more appealing than conservative democract. I think all the damage trumps done is good actually. It will either make the politicians show their true colors.

Yeah i really like both of them, warren too. Hecause at the end of the day. Nothing will change until we fix the corporate and financial corruption that is running this country. Nothing else matters hesides that and climate change. Because fixing those things, making life better for the average person will ripple out through society, dampening the shootings, racism and other issues that are boiling up right now under all this pressure.;1;0;False;Smoy;ettv4ot;I am not a fan of crypto memes;https://i.redd.it/6bbpglvbeda31.jpg
People are feeling it alright. It's just that it's a gradual change of wealth streaming slowly but steadily from normal people to the banks and the 1% who can take advantage of central banking and rampant inflation. When my parents were young, one man could buy a house and a car and provide for a family without taking a loan. Can you imagine that today?

"> “It is no coincidence that the century of total war coincided with the century of central banking.”  - Ron Paul

The Fed is one of the greatest scams in human history. I'm actually surprised by the igorance of Trump in this regard, he's been saying a long time the system is rigged against the middle class and this is the number one reason in my belief. But as many have pointed out, the tweet doesn't even seem to have been written by himself. Slightly concerning, but also a great boost to the Bitcoin brand recognition.";7;1;False;SwedishSalsa;etth2qs;I am not a fan of crypto memes;https://i.redd.it/6bbpglvbeda31.jpg

This is a guy that, in 2019, has never used email or even an actual computer for heaven's sake -- yet thinks his opinion on cryptocurrency carries any weight.
