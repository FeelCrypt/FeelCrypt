Not unless there is a previous consolidation transaction. Two inputs are two inputs, it does not matter if they are to the same address.

"> I am not going out of my way to highlight ‘an unusual or extreme example’, this was from my node, with lots of tiny mining inputs. Anyone with similar mining or faucet inputs would face the exact same fee issue.

Actually that's fair and I hadn't thought of it that way. I was thinking of the hypothetical person from the comic who has a few dollars or a few hundred or few thousand or whatever on a wallet with a single address on his iphone or android or whatever, and wants to buy a coffee. Just because that person might be the the most common or easy to imagine, doesn't make it so for other transactions or situations. It really did seem like you were going out of your way to load up a transaction with hundreds of inputs just to make it seem even more overblown. 

People are upset and frustrated with tx fees and times. I get that and agree with that, it's antithetical to the whole point and spirit of bitcoin and satoshi's vision. But running a contentious fork, where the mining is literally controlled by 2 or at most 3 miners, the 'face' of the coin is serial con artist roger ver, and the bungled and seemingly purposeful insider deal on coinbase was super gross, doesn't sit that great with me either. 

Something about this subreddit feels off.

"I feel you, I've actually been lurking for years and finally just got involved, don't know why I open my mouth sometimes!  The amount of fee was a significant turnoff.  The tx had ~280 inputs...

With 280 inputs, at 180b per input + 34 bytes for a single output address +- 280b for signatures (variable) = ~50,600 bytes.

As I write this 500 sat/byte  will get one confirmation in 1-7 blocks (10-70 minutes).  So, the cost for this would be 25,300,000 sats / 0.253 BTC, which is $3,795 with a $15k bitcoin.

To put this in perspective, iirc some large majority of all wallets have a balances of .001 or less, so even if someone had 280 mining payouts of .001 (You'd be thinking 'YEAHHH! $15 for EACH of those payouts, I'm taking THAT to the bank) but nooooo...  That's only $4200 USD with the same $15k coin... Leaving our poor pool miner with only $405 of their $4200 if they actually want to cash out.

The lowest fees that are above a 360 block confirmation time are currently 300 sat/b, so that's only 40% less than above, and highly risky... you can't double spend what you don't double have.  :|

I'm not a huge BCH fanboy, but it does seem to be solving the problem NOW, and with the larger blocksize that was only reduced to 1MB some 8 years ago to prevent spam with the intention that it grow as necessary.

I don't know that guy, or any of the personalities, I'm just evaluating use and cost.  With no other discussion than an apples to apples comparison, the same transaction on BCH, which is running ~5 sat/b would run one 0.0028 BCH, or $8.40 with a $3k USD BCH value.

This translates to:
$3795 out of $4200 for BTC = 90.35% lost to fees
or
$8.4 out of $840 for BCH = 1% lost to fees

Sad state in general, and I know which one I would pick.

I am in the real world boat of situation A above, and hoping that something, really anything comes through and will reduce the fees, but otherwise we sit and wait on the stream to be unblocked.";2;1;False;ExtraVecchio;dsibn0y;Legacy Bitcoin tries to buy a cup of coffee;https://i.redd.it/pzazijg837901.png

The point about a huge portion of wallets only holding 'minuscule' amounts of btc really is a bummer I hadn't thought deeply about. Essentially every one of those wallets that has .001 or less, even though that translates to ~$15, is almost unusable. I can't imagine a world where i had or found $15 in US dollars in my pocket or something, and couldn't spend any of it on lunch or even depositing it into my bank because of fees. 

I hope this is just part of the growing pains for btc but I really don't know. As an anecdote, I do remember getting into an argument/discussion with a friend in probably... late 2014 or 2015? And he was complaining about block size and transaction fees, that because of those things bitcoin was completely dead. And even though those problems haven't gotten fixed or solved, btc is still alive, and crypto in general is growing.

"I sympathize with anyone who spent their Christmas money buying into a hype cycle.  This story suggests that the Crypto community should be doing a lot more to publish accurate fee information.  The Bitcoin community already publishes more information than any other crypto-currency community including: help guides, charts, indexes, books, videos, journals, news sites... but the problem with hype is that people buy the hype without knowing the product.  

Crypto currencies are very cool right now. The hype is still there. How much do you know about the product?

Since you're interested in Bitcoin Cash, I'm going to give you some information about fees that applies to both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash.  Bitcoin Cash was created by forking the Bitcoin blockchain and codebase and still shares >95% of it's code.

Bitcoin is complicated.  To understand Bitcoin fees you really need to understand Bitcoin.  

* Transaction fees are not a flat price.  Users specify how much they are willing to spend to include a transaction in the blockchain.  Wallets make this easier by giving you options like **""fast"" or ""slow' confirmation**.  If you don't pay enough miners will ignore your transaction.  If you pay for ""slow"" confirmation, usually a low but reasonable amount, your transaction will be confirmed at some point in the future.   If you pay for ""fast"" confirmation your transaction will be included in the next block (10 minutes).  If you pay too much, you'll get a next block confirmation but you're wasting money.  You get to choose.
* Bitcoin fees are based on the **number of bytes** you want to transmit on the network and not the amount of money you want to send.   
* The byte size of a Bitcoin transaction is based on the number of **inputs** and **outputs**.   The more deposits you're drawing from or people you're paying with a single transaction, the more expensive that transaction will be. (https://www.cryptocompare.com/mining/guides/bitcoin-transaction-inputs-and-outputs/)
* Bitcoin Fees are calculated and paid in Bitcoin (Satoshi's are the smallest unit of value in Bitcoin) and not CAD or any other currency.  Miners that pick up your transaction don't care about the CAD value of Bitcoin unless they happen to be in Canada and the chances of that are low.

https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/  lets you see how much people are spending to send transactions on the Bitcoin network right now.  It fluctuates and has been getting more expensive on average for the last two years.

But now Bitcoin BTC is ruined, and transaction fees are ridiculously expensive.

Bitcoin BTC is not a store of wealth, because it no longer has any functional value.  

Daytraders are just tossing it around because they haven't realized that Bitcoin BTC is now a corpse, whose heart has stopped beating.

"Legacy Bitcoin is an obscure fork aka ""The real Bitcoin"".

For some reason the core developers did not want to break compatibility with it, so invented a very convoluted ""scaling"" solution called segwit. Bitcoin-segwit essentially lies when talking to ""The Real Bitcoin"" nodes: pretending the blocks are 1MB; even if the witness data is up to 4MB.

Bitcoin Cash avoids that problem by doing a clean hard-fork. This allows Bitcoin Cash to take advantage of selected segwit improvements, namely the quadratic hashing fix, on *all* transactions.

"Both theft and fraud (possibly wire fraud) would be plausible charges.

The thief had *access* to the wallet, but not *ownership* of the assets in it. Sort of like a joint bank account - say I setup a joint bank account with my friend Dave. If I deposit $1000 and he deposits $10, but then next week he withdraws all $1010 and stops answering the phone, he's committed theft. The fact that he had *access* to the funds doesn't automatically mean he had legal *ownership* of all funds in the account. This real-world case comes up periodically, especially when couples separate and one absconds with all the money from their joint account.

Fraud is even easier, because that's one of the crimes that is defined by your *intent* more so than your specific *actions*. It wouldn't be hard to convince a judge or jury here that the sellers *intention* was to trick the recipient into depositing the funds in a wallet the thief could steal the funds from.

Most scammers go to great lengths to make sure their real world identity can't be tied to their online activity, precisely because hitting them with theft and fraud would usually be a pretty simple matter, in addition in some cases to more exotic charges like say the computer fraud and abuse act, wire fraud, or money laundering.";9;3;False;kevin2357;dsj9wq0;An appeal to the thief that stole my cryptocurrency;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7poga6/an_appeal_to_the_thief_that_stole_my/

"keep in mind this is difficult to prove: we're talking about my understanding of the sentiment of evolving definitions over time, but i'll give it a shot.

[here's a popular search result for what is a cryptocurrency](https://blockgeeks.com/guides/what-is-cryptocurrency/), which incorrectly states Bitcoin was the birth of cryptocurrencies:

> After seeing all the centralized attempts fail, Satoshi tried to build a digital cash system without a central entity. Like a Peer-to-Peer network for file sharing.  
This decision became the birth of cryptocurrency. 

but supports my argument that the public does not have the same understanding as the cypherfreaks.  In the early '90s, arguably when the term 'cryptocurrency' was first coined (pun intended), the [NSA refers to the technology as 'digital cash' or 'digital currency' rather than 'cryptocurrency'](http://digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu/aulr/vol46/iss4/6/).

as the strongest indicator, if you [look at the google internet trends for 'cryptocurrency' since 2004](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&q=cryptocurrency&hl=en-US&tz=Etc%2FGMT%2B5&tz=Etc%2FGMT%2B5), the term didn't gain ANY traction until around May 2016, and didn't become popular until late this year, eight years after Bitcoin was created, and _fifteen years_ after the NSA was publishing research on it.

No you need the seed to recover funds. It's not just the password. When you recover your cryptocurrency to another wallet, you need your seed. The person that currently has the password to the ledger, can just transfer the funds to another wallet that would have brand new seed and pay the fee though and that way they have a new seed and the scumbag can keep the old seed..... What is weird though is if he sent it back, how would he know if he reset the ledger and can't access the funds?

"As a recovering attorney-convict, I’d argue that my experience coincides perfectly with your understanding (but, of course Ole Blabber Mouth has something else to say).

Suppose, OP, in this situation were to feel that they had obtained sufficient redress, relief and/or justice, after confirming the return and exclusive access to their coin/tokens - meaning OP didn’t want the person prosecuted.   Maybe OP promised he wouldn’t.  But the state or the US gov’t refused to dismiss the charges against the alleged perpetrator/s.  

What could OP do to remain true to the promise?  First, get expert legal advice from the best and brightest that you know and then ask them who they think the best and brightest are.  Second, ALWAYS appear for court when summoned and/or subpoenaed, preferably with a skillful attorney by your side.  Third, OP must be exceptionally skillful to successfully remain true to the promise and avoid testifying should the defendant be arrested.  And the defendant must trust that OP will do as promised.  If the defendant disbelieves OP they’ll likely enter a guilty plea, more than 97% of US defendants do.

But imagine if the thief trusted OP, and OP honored the promise?  And all of this was originally set in motion, how?  By greed,  BUT second and possibly interesting to redditors, cryptographers and the technologically-inclined is that this saga occurs cyber ecosystem.  Distributed Ledger Technology’s development and success requires that we TRUST IT.  And this demand is oxymoronic in the face of it being developed by humans, who are invariably untrustworthy. And that is consistent with what I have read, which is that computer scientists developed this blockchain technology, in hopes of accelerating our micro-evolution towards factual accuracy and trust?

Having a legal education AND getting out of prison in Nov. ‘16 on a 7 year bid, I can appreciate the complexity of story, interests, and tensions.  For me, there is a beauty in it - It’s not only super fucking interesting, it’s poetically ironic!

Post Script: And to the alleged defendant, if you do go to prison, invoke the same energy, innovation and observation skills used to take from OP and hopefully those efforts will allow you to leave incarceration whole.

"The term cryptocurrency is fairly new and doesn't really have a very strict definition. The term was never used in the whitepaper and it was never used by the authors of many much older currency systems similar to Bitcoin, such as Wei Dai (b-money 1998) or DigiCash (David Chaum 1989). It seems to be a term that appeared sometime after Satoshi disappeared.

Chip and PIN credit cards make use of cryptography, SWIFT transfers use cryptography, and as mentioned PayPal requires you to use cryptography (negotiate a TLS session) in order to send funds. Indeed, even the founders of PayPal claim that a Bitcoin-style system was their original goal, before they got bogged down with regulatory issues.

Limiting the definition of cryptocurrency to a currency that only uses cryptographic signatures to transfer funds seems wrong. Bitcoin can be transferred off-chain from one Coinbase account to another without the use of a digital signature, does that mean Bitcoin isn't a cryptocurrency?

Probably the best definition is a currency that is better than traditional currencies and traditional money transfer systems in some way due to its use of cryptography.";9;0;False;c0llision41;dsiz2ml;An appeal to the thief that stole my cryptocurrency;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7poga6/an_appeal_to_the_thief_that_stole_my/

I’m really sorry to hear about this. I have a lot of my life savings in crypto and I’d be devastated if I lost any amount. I’m just curious about the preinstalled recovery seed you mention. My Trezor required me to generate the initial seed. There was no preinstalled seed otherwise how would we trust Trezor? I’m making a big assumption because I don’t own a Ledger but I’d imagine they would do the same... no? I’ve been thinking about getting a Ledger myself as a second hardware wallet but there’s no way in hell that I’d buy one if it has a preinstalled seed. Are you sure you got that part right? ;2;2;False;ryanisflying;dsjdttf;An appeal to the thief that stole my cryptocurrency;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7poga6/an_appeal_to_the_thief_that_stole_my/

"> Sort of like a joint bank account - say I setup a joint bank account with my friend Dave. If I deposit $1000 and he deposits $10, but then next week he withdraws all $1010 and stops answering the phone, he's committed theft. 

Really? I mean, I always thought the concept of joint account is that of full trust and full control by all holders. I could conceive a joint account with special terms and contracts (like legal person's account, for instance), but in the absence of those particular terms I would think that the example you give does not configure theft.... what's even the point of having a joint account then?

> This real-world case comes up periodically, especially when couples separate and one absconds with all the money from their joint account.

"My guess: He realized that he probably didn't have as perfect opsec as he thought (or, worse for him, *didn't* even think about), and would thus likely get caught and have a less than pleasant future in front of him. I helpfully provided a long (but still incomplete) list of ways that could get him caught in the previous thread, maybe he found it and realized he made a mistake somewhere :)

Returning the money before getting caught increases the probability that people (the victim, police) lose interest and either stop looking for him, or at least spend less effort, increasing the chance that he gets away, without the loot, but also without jail time and without getting the shit beaten out of him (either by a victim or some random guy who thinks he has a lot of coins).

Even if police continue looking and he gets caught, such a change of mind is tremendously helpful when it comes to sentencing, and may be the difference between a slap on the wrist and serious time.

Maybe he's also just a somewhat decent person and only now truly realized that he's not just pushing buttons and making money appear from the Internet, but actually affecting other real people.";21;0;False;aaaaaaaarrrrrgh;dsj6r5v;An appeal to the thief that stole my cryptocurrency;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7poga6/an_appeal_to_the_thief_that_stole_my/

"I'm not sure if your clarifying something I said or correcting me? I don't think anyone was under the impression that SWIFT was a crypto but it is good to specify its really just a communication system to augment our traditional and slow systems for international transfers.


My point, and yours I think, was that Ripple solves the issue of delayed settlement that banks are currently forced to work with today. So when I say Ripple has a good chance of replacing SWIFT I mean not as a communication platform but rather as the system of moving large sums of money between institutions.

"So... let's start with the first thing XRP = Ripple.

XRP is Ripple.  In order to transfer funds, banks MUST purchase XRP tokens. The XRP tokens transfer over the ripple ledger to make the transaction. Then the bank sells their XRP on the other side to their desired currency. Or they could simply keep the XRP if they wanted.

XRP is the same as bitcoin. It's just a distributed ledger.  It's like saying people don't need Bitcoin to transfer money. They can sell the bitcoin as soon as they get it in their wallet. No.... that sounds stupid, right? You had to buy the bitcoin first to transfer it. It doesn't matter if you sell it later.

The next thing : 100 Billion tokens were created out of thin air, ***unlike other cryptocurrencies***. HAH. Plenty of established coins were premined, and Bitcoins distribution method is simply different. It may be more ""fair"" but bitcoins are also created out of ""thin air"". No one cares that you wasted electricity in order to produce it. I just farted hot air out of my ass, does that mean you're willing to pay for it?

I agree centralized owners is not a good thing if they control a large part of the currency, but that's a separate issue.

"Actually Bitcoin Cash has several development teams. There is scaling solutions being developed other than just increasing the block size of course. That said having raised it has caused absolutely no centralisation.

It seems the myth that larger blocks cause centralisation of the network is based on some basic misunderstandings of both how how the network works, and how much more difficult it is to run a node with larger blocks.

First of all non-mining nodes contribute nothing to decentralisation of the network. They are only for personal confirmation of the transmission of a transaction to the network. They are most useful to those accepting transactions.

Second it is well within the capability of very cheap machines to run a Bitcoin Cash node anyway. Even if there was no limit to the blocksize the size of a block can only be as large as the transactions transmitted to the network. Blocks are not just the max size every time. If they are then the max size needs to increase.

Now understanding the second part let's you know that it takes mass adoption of Bitcoin in order for the amount of requested transactions to get that high. With that increase in adoption you see that much increase in desire to mine, and or run a node. So even as the difficulty to do so would increase the amount doing so would also increase.

So even with 1GB blocks which would allow competing with VISA, which has been tested, it would still be a decentralised network.";1;0;False;SILENTSAM69;dsi6mst;Let's make MDMA a legal medicine for PTSD.

"I agree that most medicine won't work (and many chemicals are dangerous to human body) and there's lots of snake oil sellers out there.

We are not very good about thinking risk aversion. We let people do way crazier shit than use ineffective medicine. Like go skydiving and die. Besides it should be that safe is enough. Effective would be extra. Phase 2+3 are super expensive.

Think about the people who suffer from PTSD. If its proven that taking some amounts of MDMA in therapeutic setting is safe, in worst case they have a bad experience and that is all. 

For example cluster headaches are the most painful diseases known to man. LSD (or its non-hallucinogenic variant) have stopped them in some people. Maybe it won't work but I think as soon it has been prove physiologically safe, I think people should be ""allowed"" to use it. If you ask me, I think all medicine should be just marked safe or effective by FDA. If you want to buy snake oil, by all means, do it. People can have different utility functions (and thus risk-aversion).

"The real problem is not only that things that work are not allowed (marijuana, mdma, etc.) but that institutions like the FDA are nothing but an extension of the drug companies. This is why in the USA a bottle of Vitamin C, for example, must say ""FDA disclaimer: This product not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease"" if the manufacturer tried to say something like ""Cures scurvy"".

The FDA process for getting a drug (which is by definition a patented molecule) approved is to have two double-blind, placebo controlled studies that show a positive effect. The studies are done by the drug company, not the FDA. If the company pays for 100 studies that show horrible effects and no health benefit, they can ignore them. They only need to provide the two good ones. The average cost to get a drug approved is many, many millions of dollars. The patent on the drug lasts 7 years (or 10, can't remember), and when it runs out, other companies can make generics. Often what happens then is the drug companies tweak the molecule slightly in a lab, go through the approval process again, and claim it is ""improved"". This means another income stream for the next decade.

Meanwhile, supplements, micro-nutrients, things like MDMA, marijuana, etc. (things that actually cure diseases) are ignored. There is no money in them, because they can't be patented. The supplement company also has no way to afford all the studies needed to go through the approval process, and even if they did, again, there would be no benefit to them. FDA board members are a select few and have a lot of final say. Often times they themselves are or were drug company chairman/higher ups.

Fun fact: ~85%+ of drugs are plant molecules that were tweaked in a lab. These molecules usually have no side effects and are as or more effective than the end result drug in the first place.

Fun Fact 2: A large percentage of drugs inhibit stomach acid production, which means the person taking them absorbs less nutrition while they are on it, furthering the underlying problem in many cases.

"But Bitcoin Cash has the majority support now, because the majority of miners (more than 50%) supported big blocks, in the form of Segwit2X, remember ?

Then they got shafted, so now when the strategic time comes, miners will, unavoidably, rally behind Bitcoin Cash. Because miners do not really care for segwit, they care for big blocks, which BTC WILL NEVER HAVE, EVER.

Edit: And before you ""but Bitcoin Cash only gets such and such percentage of miners"" please realize that miners will milk BTC chain into the grave, because it's more profitable to THEM to maintain it in even an undead state, for maximum profit.

Miners will transition to BCH in majority, when BTC will be illiquid, and that is when it will be impossible to transact the mining rewards. Which is total death.

"Changing your own opinion is what you do when new evidence is presented and arguments are further laid out. Sometimes it just takes a bit of time or a single crucial point needs to be refuted for somebody to rethink something.

I won't get into a debate about BTC/BCH politics. It just doesn't matter all that much to me.
