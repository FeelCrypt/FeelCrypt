Sure! It'd be very easy to strip Staples, Walmart, Amazon, eBay, etc of handheld calculators. You could dramatically reduce calculator purchasing to almost nothing. Calculators aren't some addictive good and there are plenty of calculator substitutes. Your outlawing handheld calculator sales would decimate calculator producing divisions and effectively force every publicly traded company with a calculator producing unit to shut it down.;1;0;False;chuckymcgee;dmsn7fo;China bans bitcoin again;https://i.redd.it/8p1xesgk9okz.jpg

"Mods do choose who gets to speak and who doesn't. The way to do that is by defining this ""special people"" and ""special list"" etc. It's important to understand why they do it: to suppress people of their choosing. Wouldn't be a problem but this subreddit claims to be uncensored and mods also lie about this list usage etc.

>Nope, and such a message would be childish if it was actually worded in that exact way.

Does it matter if it's childish or not? Well, it's pretty much word-by-word if you replace ""worthy"" to ""prominent"".

>I'm not on the whitelist either

You have the same abilities as people in the whitelist. Only way to make you lose those abilities (and not being in the whitelist) is to get your subreddit karma below zero. It's easy: just say stuff that's not in line with the agenda.

>Getting into whilelists isn't something you can demand or expect.

"The uniqueness of the Bitcoin Cash fork was that it gave everyone whom stayed on the original chain, a stake in Bitcoin Cash. In fact, anyone who owned Bitcoin before the fork got the exact same portion of the pie of Bitcoin Cash.  
  
Core supporters say this is an ""attack"" because Bitcoin Cash essentially used forced adoption of their coin by anyone that used Bitcoin - even if they had no intention of moving/supporting the fork. Following the fork, those whom wanted to get rid of the coin and sell it, could not for about a week or two. Some simply didn't see the point in wasting their time on Bitcoin Cash as they only believed in Bitcoin.  
  
There was another way to do this, by starting at the genesis block on Bitcoin Cash, that way anyone who believed in it could just mine/buy it at their leisure. However, that would most likely lead to the same conclusion of Bitcoin Unlimited - irrelevancy.  
  
Personally, I can see both arguments as valid. There are places where Bitcoin supporters can go to sell Bitcoin Cash now, if they want. I think the markets will decide, and it is too early to conclude if their is a sure ""winner"". I think both coins will exist in a year.

"> It's nothing special.

I'm going by the words of the mod that you linked to. It's reserved for special people by policy - that makes the list special in my vocabulary.

> It simply restores ones ability to post like others

Yes, you have described what it *does*, but you seem to be asserting that your viewpoint on how it should be *used* is the only correct one. If that's the case (that users can decide the sub's use or non-use of reddit features), why wouldn't users also have the right to be unbanned when asking for it?

> It's the only use of whitelist.

Sure, but failure to add you to the list still doesn't constitute censorship. It's presumably your own actions that leads to you being throttled and you don't seem to be willing to accept or deal with the consequences of that.

> It's not even visible anywhere. It's not a flair or a tag or anything like that.

Good to know, ty.

> All in all, it doesn't even matter what Reddit thinks about it.

Why did you argue that they encouraged adding people like yourself to it then?

> Fact is that it's suppressing real users and subreddit mods can control it.

As long at the policy is open (even reddit-wide), it's not discriminating you in any way. Your words and your actions may have consequences and I don't think you can blame them for that.

> Again, whitelist exists ONLY to unrestrict people.

Chill, you don't have to repeat yourself over and over.

> One of the r/Btc mods said they have done this.

Where? Did they also say why? Are there any open policies on this - or could we derive any from the way it was handled?

> Could be opened same way as ""open modlog"".

Sure? You didn't really answer my question.

You're starting to sound like a broken record.

From who? Have you tried finding out if it's true?

You shouldn't complain about that until you've made sure it's even possible to do.

> If so, who knows why... And what else is not in there?

That's concern trolling based on little evidence, for now. The mod team seems to be committed to allowing open discussion and transparency (as far at the tooling allows it), as far as I've seen.

"> Stop trying to redefine my words. I said it is special due to the way it's being used, not due to some other magical specialness.

Not trying to redefine your words. Just saying that it's nothing special in the eyes of normal person. One can of course claim that e.g. letter A is very very special just because they feel it's so special. This is the case with whitelist. Mods can feel it's special while in *reality* it's not so, as I've described many times to you. So can we agree on that it's not special, no matter how much people claim it's special? :)

>Well, I've given you mine. Don't I count?

Well, it's hard to have opinions whether a fact is true or not.

>No, it's the opposite of active.

They send me a message where they say ""We will not whitelist you because we do not see you as worthy."" Did that message passively pop up in my inbox?

At least you are ignoring them, then. This is what I wrote in the post you replied to: ""I'm going by the words of the mod that you linked to. It's reserved for special people by policy - that makes the list special in my vocabulary.""

This explains what I meant by calling it ""special"", and then you rant on about some completely separate kind of meaning.

>  So can we agree on that it's not special, no matter how much people claim it's special?

Yes, it's not special in the sense that you're using it. But as far as I know, no one has claimed that, so I don't know why it's important to you to point out that.

> They send me a message where they say ""We will not whitelist you because we do not see you as worthy."" Did that message passively pop up in my inbox?

Nope, and such a message would be childish if it was actually worded in that exact way. But it still wouldn't make you any worse off than myself.

The fact is that the list is *not* special in any way. It only normalizes ones ability to speak. Only reason to call it ""special"" is to restrict certain peoples ability to discuss normally. Again, the list has no other functionality. It is not special, no matter how much mods want to paint it as such.

>Yes, you have described what it does, but you seem to be asserting that your viewpoint on how it should be used is the only correct one.

It can't be used in any other way. Whitelist = way to normalize ones ability to discuss & bypass other possible restrictions. Nothing special. There's no other viewpoint either, except that some mods want to call it ""invite-only"" or ""special"" or whatever to keep me and some others restricted. Do you agree?

>Sure, but failure to add you to the list still doesn't constitute censorship.

It does suppress me. It's active enforcement by them. They specifically told me that *they will keep me* restricted. It's *their* choice. Not anyone elses. It's not passive, it's active choice by them. rBtc seems to have a hard time accepting the fact that this sub wants to steer the opinions and agenda shown. They've succeeded quite fine in brainwashing newbies.

>You're starting to sound like a broken record.

It's a simple fact: **WHITELIST IS NOT ANYTHING SPECIAL.**

Even after I repeated it in various ways at least four times in my last post, your post here tells me that you still don't get that it's nothing special. Think about it.
