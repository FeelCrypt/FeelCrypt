Right now only bitcoin, as it is the heavily controlled sub.  Next week we'll be adding /r/btc by popular demand(not sure why with public mod logs) and other subs as requests/time allows.  There are limits to how many subs one bot can handle though.;2;1;False;censorship_notifier;dmhdas5;New anti-censorship bot for /r/bitcoin;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6ws7ax/new_anticensorship_bot_for_rbitcoin/
"Thanks. I think that ideally there should be a bot that monitors *all* subreddits and not just a few (including /r/btc). It's good to be notified always because even with open mod logs it's easy to miss. 

If I subscribe to your bot censorship notification messages now, will I automatically be added to all future subreddits that get added? I'd like that.";1;1;False;todu;dmhdijd;New anti-censorship bot for /r/bitcoin;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6ws7ax/new_anticensorship_bot_for_rbitcoin/
"Yes, once subscribed the bot won't differentiate.

While it would be great to watch all subreddits, the process is very request heavy.  The more users, posts, comments, subs being watched, the longer the delays before the bot can detects something amiss (reddit limits requests).

Once we open source this, people can run them for subreddits as they desire.  Few weeks out for that, but we'll get there.";2;1;False;censorship_notifier;dmhdt9d;New anti-censorship bot for /r/bitcoin;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6ws7ax/new_anticensorship_bot_for_rbitcoin/
Every honest subreddit should advertise such a bot in their sidebar in my opinion. Thanks, I've subscribed to your bot's notification messages.;1;0;False;todu;dmhdzpo;New anti-censorship bot for /r/bitcoin;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6ws7ax/new_anticensorship_bot_for_rbitcoin/

No they can't provide *unbiased* articles because there is no such thing as information without bias. Except perhaps empiric data, which can still easily contain bias.;1;0;False;Leaky_gland;dmgn4jy;New ad running on /r/Bitcoin;http://i.imgur.com/NKgRRqU.png
