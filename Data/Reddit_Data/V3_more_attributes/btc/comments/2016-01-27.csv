"100% agree that this is the problem. Blockstream Core devs continue to shelter themselves in their bubble in r/bitcoin because they know that outside of their bubble they are one of the most hated companies in the Bitcoin space. So they continue on there knowing they are protected by theymos and his goons so they can push their agenda. It's very sick and then they try to turn it around on everyone else saying other subs like r/btc are bad because we bash Blockstream. Well I'm sorry, but this is real life here, not your fantasy world you are living in! 

Oh, did people already forget how Blockstream Core sent their head goon btcdrak here to try to subvert this sub and censor anyone that opposed Blockstream? Thank goodness we have good mods now that kicked him out when they saw what they were up to. But oh ""Blockstream is so innocent"" yeah right!!!";2;0;False;Gobitcoin;cze1tsl;This is a public call to Core to renounce Theymos' censorship of /r/bitcoin;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/42kmlw/this_is_a_public_call_to_core_to_renounce_theymos/
"Here in this tweet Adam Back clearly says that he supported the censorship in r/bitcoin https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/662174961818292224

>vote stuffers basically succeeded to censor good-faith bitcoin discussion. **theymos tried to make it more usable by censoring that.**

Then just yesterday, Blockstream's Greg Maxwell just reiterated how he supports censorship even after all of this, still!

Now you know why people think Blockstream supports censorship. ";2;0;False;Gobitcoin;cze2za5;This is a public call to Core to renounce Theymos' censorship of /r/bitcoin;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/42kmlw/this_is_a_public_call_to_core_to_renounce_theymos/
