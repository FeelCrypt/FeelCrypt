"A small number of % perhaps, it's in the natural volatility of bitcoin anyway. But a few of the movements in that graph are very big.

I certainly remember the big price drop from ~$300 down to ~$200 when r/bitcoin's front page was covered in pro-BitcoinXT pumping. r/bitcoinmarkets was commenting on it as a reason for the movement.

I also remember the price drop after Mike Hearn's interview to the New York Times saying bitcoin had failed because it won't hard fork. Traders called it the Hernia.

"The mike hearn one definitely had a clear cause/effect, but the majority of those are much more likely to merely be routine price fluctuations. 

>Link me to the stuff this sub has collected, let's see if they're as good as these.

I don't find them any better. If you read /r/bitcoinmarkets you'll often see people post charts with random tweets and then others respond with correlation =/= causation.  

>Aside: Now that you've resigned, shouldn't your flair be changed.

I've already messaged the mods about it, they said they would change it but apparently haven't gotten around to it yet. /u/BitcoinXio mind helping me out?";2;3;False;zanetackett;dafvkom;With the public spotlight on Reddit censorship, now would be the perfect time to let the rest of Reddit know about the censorship on /r/bitcoin;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5eqvhs/with_the_public_spotlight_on_reddit_censorship/

False. Did you not read the post you replied to? I already provided a screenshot with evidence showing how this does *not* happen.

> You were denying a method of doing this, I wanted to ensure that the focus of any reader stayed on the fact that you do it. BeijingBitcoins merely stated the method you used to use instead of the method you currently use.

The method mentioned is the only way it has ever been done. That method is not in use, nor is any other method.

"Your solution is a broken Bitcoin *and* a split community. The worst of all possible outcomes.

Larger blocks won't break Bitcoin as other coins clearly prove. Classic offers a smaller block size footprint than segwit. FFS.

"Feel free to use the space below to add your clear personal denouncement of Theymos and his crew for the harm they have done to the entire community by censoring discussion to suit his questionable personal agenda, splitting the community in two with his childish ""it's my sub and I don't care if 90% of all the users disagree with me"" attitude.";1;1;False;jessquit;dafn9f9;With the public spotlight on Reddit censorship, now would be the perfect time to let the rest of Reddit know about the censorship on /r/bitcoin;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5eqvhs/with_the_public_spotlight_on_reddit_censorship/
"On the one hand you people want to make it appear that the big blockers have the strong hands with their ability to overwhelm discussion on reddit to suit themselves - (using costly paid shills and custom programmed bots of course since you claim that obviously big blockers are a minority opinion).

And yet it's clear that it is the small block camp with the deep pocket investors, able to throw resources at problems, DDoSing opponents, obtaining signed agreements to create an anti competitive mining cartel, and moving the price to suit the small block agenda.

So I'm going with: actually reddit reflects public user opinion after all and we're all being taken for a ride.
