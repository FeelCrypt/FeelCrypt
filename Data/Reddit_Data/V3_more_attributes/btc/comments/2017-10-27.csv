"Agreed. What's been unique about bitcoin was actually how difficult it was for them to setup rent-seeking, and how easily it has been for us who were not bamboozled to 'route around damage' created by Blockstream by forking off BCC and the like.

In most software projects, they would've had no trouble doing this sort of thing. But bitcoin as a protocol is more resistant to this kind of dev-capture tactic, and it is by no means certain that it will work for Blockstream long-term.

These days, most corruption comes in the form of 'if you do X you'll be rich.' And Blockstream devs are just proving the rule. To think all they've put the community through was for anything except to try to make themselves millionaires is a grave mistake. They were willing to sell out everything that made bitcoin bitcoin, in order to become rich themselves, to rent-seek on their control of the main repo.

"> It proves that Gregory Maxwell is the liar 

I'm not commenting on this particular case, but all you need to do is go through Greg's history and all the evidence will be there, written directly by him.

He is a very untrustworthy and unsavoury character. I would not trust him with anything, or put him in charge of anything. He may be talented, he may be highly skilled, but he is the sort of person that should never be in charge of anything. Employed for his talent and skill, sure, but in charge? God no. 

The great thing about the internet is history is saved in perpetuity. Greg's posted under his real name or under identified aliases for a long time. His history is extensive and so incredibly damning. I'm not expecting anyone to take my opinion as super meaningful. I guess I'm just saying, read the history out there.

"So everyone running a Bitcoin Core node has been bamboozled eh?  And when everyone defers to scaled entities to maintain the blockchain, that's a) not ontologically the same as fiat and b) a wider distribution of power that thwarts rent seeking?

The narratives in this sub are getting really thin.  Core, by making the network more stable and reducing the barrier to entry to run your own node and claim full autonomy over a new form of money, and in-so-doing making the network more robust against attack and regulation, are the rent seekers, and the people who want to increase the barrier to entry are the ones distributing regulatory power to the end-user?

It's really depressing too.  Have none of you ever had the pleasure of being empowered by someone else in your life?  How did that go?

> and in-so-doing making the network more robust

The utility of the network is falling day by day. Bitcoin has even lost its original use case of darknet purchases. They all prefer monero now. The more fees rise and the more unpredictable confirmation times become, the more people switch to alternatives. 

As I write this I'm waiting over 3 hours now for a purchase I made on OpenBazaar to confirm. I paid $1.62 fee. This is a horrible UX and almost certainly you'll be adding OpenBazaar to the list of apps that have dropped bitcoin if there aren't fundamental changes. 

We have reached a point in bitcoin where literally the only thing it's used for is speculative trading. And most people in /r/bitcoin mock the idea of using it for anything but that. 

It's a really sad state of affairs. I still own a ton of bitcoin, mostly to try to profit from people's irrationality, but I've written it off in terms of it ever being useful money.

">     It is bloat because it is being subsidized.
> 
> How?

Segwit makes signature data cheaper. That means the network is subsidizing Segwit transactions. Since the data still needs to be stored and transmitted it should cost the same as other transactions.

>     If you simply increased the blocksize users could still submit transactions with signatures that size but pay per byte like everyone else.
>

So? Every other coin has managed to do safe hard forks. There is no evidence that there is any problems with them.

>     How would you prevent the bloat in future hard forks?
> 
> The weight of witness and non-witness (""Bloat"") data can be adjusted.

This does not remove the bloat. Every blocksize increase still can store additional bloat. Also the idea of developers becoming central planners is highly concerning. These decisions should be hard coded not decided arbitrarily. This is one of the biggest criticisms to Segwit.

It is bloat because it is being subsidized. If you simply increased the blocksize users could still submit transactions with signatures that size but pay per byte like everyone else.

How would you prevent the bloat in future hard forks? Are you suggesting we limit the number of Segwit transactions per block, or remove Segwit altogether? Those, as far as I can tell, would be the only way to prevent that bloat from being increased with every blocksize increase.

Garzik took the payola to engineer the 2X ""compromise"" using his prior status as a respected Bitcoin developer,  the 2X part being optional but guaranteeing SegWit, a pretty classic bait and switch.

"First, ""core"" is a group of independent developers. If you meant blockstream, then yes, kind of like that. The difference in my view is that blockstream is attempting to provide a technical service to companies entering the crypto space for a fee, where as banks traditionally limit access, then charge users fees to act as authority figures with access. One is providing a service to companies for a fee, where as the other has traditionally inserted figurative roadblocks for the purpose of charging tolls.

Also, the blockstream solution doesn't preclude the option of on chain transactions separate from their payment channels, where as centralization through blocksize increase ultimately effects every single user. Having the option of a cheaper, but centralized payment channel tx or a more costly but decentralized on chain transactions is better than a one size fits all solution in my opinion. 2MB blocks obviously won't lead to centralization, but people in this sub are already talking about the recent testing of GB blocks, which absolutely will price out individual users and lead to corporate centralization.

This paper, created before the BCH fork, outlines exactly what they're trying to do. Cripple Bitcoin's main chain so they can sell solutions like LN which their banker buddies can exploit to extract rent from the system, and Liquid which allows them to centrally lease block space. Both of these systems will control miner profitability and ensure Blockstream gains more control of the system over time.

They've already lost, the existence of Bitcoin Cash means they don't control the infrastructure they way they were counting on and now even the users are waking up to their deception, censorship, and otherwise toxic behavior.
