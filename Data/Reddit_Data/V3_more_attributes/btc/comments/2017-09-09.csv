Literally the only thing I said in the preceding post was that I didn't want to *start off* with looking at people I chat with as an enemy, then you said you lost all respect for me.

Naturally, I was a bit baffled at this sudden loss of respect and was wondering about what caused it. Simply *asking* you if my first impression was correct shouldn't be too aggressive?

What reasons have I made up and what hole am I digging? I feel you're jumping to conclusions about my motives all over the place now, while I *try* not to do the same about you. Now I'm genuinely not sure what you would accept people to say to you after you told them that you lost all respect for them. Is there any way I could've explained myself or asked you about what you meant in a better way (so that I may learn not to offend, next time)?

> Well you reward toll behavior.

If you see it as me rewarding trolls, I somewhat understand what you're getting at. In my opinion it's the people who fling insults as trolls that reward them. I should hope I'm allowed to hold that opinion without losing the respect of non-fanatical people.

I *like* asking questions and honestly trying to understand what make people come to their opinions, trolls included. It's just how I approach life in general, I guess. If it all leads to shitthrowing, I will stop talking to them, but for now I'm exploring how anduckk ticks. Usually I ignore him, and he's quite high up on my RES-tracked troll-meter, so I perfectly well know what to expect in the end - but I would still like to engang with him on my own terms instead of dropping to his level.

It's nothing special. It simply restores ones ability to post like others (who haven't received a ton of downvotes.)

It's an excuse to call it ""special"" or ""reserved for X, Y and Z people only"" or whatever.

It's the only use of whitelist. It's not even visible anywhere. It's not a flair or a tag or anything like that.

>Can you give me a link to where I can read about this encouragement an/or the rationale for it being added to fight spambots?

No. It's googleable I guess. All in all, it doesn't even matter what Reddit thinks about it. Fact is that it's suppressing real users and subreddit mods can control it.

>Do you have any example of persons being added to this list for the purpose of anti-throttling, i.e. has it ever avtually been used in the sense that you suggest?

One of the r/Btc mods said they have done this. Again, whitelist exists ONLY to unrestrict people. Whitelist has no other function or reason to exist.

Yes, at a very high level, that's true. But they apparently have a very restrictive policy for who gets into the special whitelist, so it doesn't seem like it's actually being used as a mechanism for deciding who will not be censored, in the way that you are suggesting.

> Reddit encourages mods to remove suppression for non-spammers -- the mechanism is simply made to defend against spambots etc.

Ok, I'm not familiar with the background for these throttling policies or why they were added to reddit as a whole (in my last post I was just guessing at the motivation). Can you give me a link to where I can read about this encouragement from reddit and/or the rationale for it being added (e.g. to fight spambots or whatever)?

Do you have any example of persons being added to this list for the purpose of anti-throttling, i.e. has it ever avtually been used in the sense that you suggest?

> Whitelist is afaik not open.

Ok, so that's suboptimal, at least from a transparency viewpoint. Do you know if this is a policy or if there's just no way to open it due to the way reddit works? (I guess they could always manually maintain the list somewhere, but that's prone to errors, being outdated, claims of malicious inaccuracies, takes time, etc.)

">Stop calling your altcoin Bitcoin? Call it Bcash or something that's not easily mixed with Bitcoin, OK?

The consensus here is that Bitcoin Cash is actually Bitcoin as detailed in the whitepaper. Once the total POW exceeds what is now called Bitcoin, I plan on calling Bitcoin Cash Bitcoin. Because we think this, it makes sense to give it a name that makes people mix it with Bitcoin. Not for the purpose of tricking people into using it, but rather so that a thoughtful individual sees two coins claiming the name Bitcoin and thinks for themselves/researches about which has the more credible claim to the name. This is how Bitcoin Cash will win in the long term, thoughtful individuals making their own decisions, honestly. 

>Bitcoin Cash is not Bitcoin. Fooling people to think otherwise is an attack towards them.

We are not attacking them, this severe language is not required. By buying Bitcoin Cash, they are buying a version of Bitcoin that is more focused on the cash aspects of money FIRST, as an avenue to a store of value. Not the other way around.

You are no where near actively silenced. Unlike r/Bitcoin, you can actually say anything about btc bcash you want without being removed. You are just limited by how many posts you can make per 20~ minutes which was because of the karma you had when you made the comment you linked.

The fact that r/bitcoin (the face of core) has chosen the path of dogmatic censorship is already proof that they are desperately trying to maintain control and brainwash their people, not unlike North Korea. This is in direct opposition of the vision of bitcoin already, which is about decentralization and freedom.

"Well Bitcoin cash is actually the closet thing to Bitcoin.

The Bitcoin core project is a radical departure from the original design.

Remember one of the main arguments to make Bitcoin a settlement layer is that Bitcoin onchain is fundamentally broken. (Cannot scale, will centralize)

Are you denying that Bitcoin core ow a departure from the original design?";25;0;False;Ant-n;dmroeec;Before and after the Bitcoin Cash hard fork;http://i.imgur.com/4kygVcW.png
"You clearly haven't read the whitepaper. Bitcoin cash functions far more similarly to the original bitcoin. You support radical changes that thousands who came before you do not approve.

>    A  purely   peer-to-peer   version   of   electronic   cash   would   allow   online payments   to   be   sent   directly   from   one   party   to   another   without   going   through   a  financial institution.

Full blocks lead to a fee market that doesn't allow Bitcoin to spend like cash. The solution is to push people to stop using direct party to party transfers out of necessity. 

> We define an electronic coin as a chain of digital signatures.  Each owner transfers the coin to the next by digitally signing a hash of the previous transaction and the public key of the next owner and adding these to the end of the coin.  A payee can verify the signatures to verify the chain of ownership.

Next you separate the signatures and still call yourself Bitcoin.
