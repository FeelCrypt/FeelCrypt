"> While that would probably be good for the share value in the short term, I would question long-term holding if it didn't adapt. When supply does not meet demand, a smart owner would expand capacity or to new locations. Every time a long line deters a customer, it is lost revenue that night and in the future when they are less likely to consider your place.

I know more than one restaurant that adapted, only to fall out of favor because the new, second floor was too much for the kitchen etc. I am fine with my favorite pizza place going out of business for hasty changes.

"When Bitcoin was designed eight years ago, this wasn't considered 'bloat', it was considered accurate accounting: one spent coin requires one signature to demonstrate the right to spend. This is more important than you might think, because Bitcoin addresses are not simply destinations, but actually cryptographic challenges. A common 1xxxx address is simply a ""human friendlier"" way of representing ""this coin can be spent with a signature that meets a basic cryptographic challenge"", while 3xxxx addresses are more complex scripts (e.g. ""this coin can be spent with a combination of any two signatures that individually meet any of these three cryptographic challenges"" = 2-of-3 multisig).

The issue arises when using one signature to meet multiple challenges (i.e. eliminating the bloat). While it's technically possible there are additional caveats that negatively impact the cryptographic security of the model. These challenges are not insurmountable, but they were not part of the original design - it was (and maybe still is) more sensible to require each output be independently signed for, since this is a layer of complication that affords no utility, and simply shifts complexity from one step to another. (Simpler to sign once, more complex to repetitively validate)

Another interesting corner case that complicates the issue: what about scripts that have multiple solutions (back to the multisig example)? If multiple coins are sent to a script with multiple solutions, those coins could be spent with different solutions to the challenge - totally different signatures entirely, despite being the same address - and, since they exist in such a form, *must* support this behavior to function correctly (and prevent loss of funds!)";3;1;False;chernobyl169;dekugmx;For 55.2% of Bitcoin addresses, fees are now bigger than the amount of Bitcoin they have.

This for the cost of one fee, which I was going to spend anyways to make the coffee-buy transaction.

"... That's still not how bitcoin works. A bitcoin address isn't an account number - to spend bitcoin, you must prove where you got it from. The way you do that is by signing each individual output you want to use.

Let's say an address has accumulated 0.01 BTC from 10 change transactions of 0.001, and let's say the change transactions are called A-J.

What you're imagining is something like:

""I own 1CHANGEADDRESS with 0.01 in it (signature). I'd like to send 0.009 to 1DUMMYADDRESS and pay a fee of 0.001.""

It's actually communicated like this:

""I can spend 0.001 from A (signature). I can spend 0.001 from B (signature). I can spend 0.001 from C (signature). I can spend 0.001 from D (signature). I can spend 0.001 from E (signature). I can spend 0.001 from F (signature). I can spend 0.001 from G (signature). I can spend 0.001 from H (signature). I can spend 0.001 from I (signature). I can spend 0.001 from J (signature). I'd like to send 0.009 to 1DUMMYADDRESS, and pay a fee of 0.001.""

Type 2 people are great at maintaining stability for well operated systems.

"These addresses wouldn't be unspendable if Bitcoin price were 1000x higher, and Bitcoin fees were 1000x lower.

This economic disaster was totally avoidable - and it is directly the blame of Core/Blockstream/[AXA](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin+btc/search?q=axa).

We can easily fix this - by rejecting Core/Blockstream/[AXA](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin+btc/search?q=axa)'s crippled code and centrally planned blocksize (which is artificially suppressing the price and artificially increasing the fees) - and use code which supports market-based blocksize as originally designed by Satoshi (eg, Bitcoin Unlimited):

> Bitcoin Original: Reinstate Satoshi's original 32MB max blocksize. If actual blocks grow 54% per year (and price grows 1.54^2 = 2.37x per year - Metcalfe's Law), then in 8 years we'd have 32MB blocks, 100 txns/sec, 1 BTC = 1 million USD - 100% on-chain P2P cash, without SegWit/Lightning or Unlimited

USAF: User-activated-soft-fork. The idea is that if all nodes on the network upgrade to segwit, then the miners would be ""forced"" to upgrade as well. In reality, this concept is horribly flawed:

* This isn't a soft fork. What the fuck?
* You can't have transactions without miners.
* Okay, lets say 25% (currently segwit voting) miners and 80% of the current nodes participate in this coup attempt
* The other 75% of the network + major exchanges actually wouldn't be affected. They would operate as normal. You would be able to buy and sell bitcoins on Coinbase, transactions would go through.
* Meanwhile, on the 25% hashrate chain, transactions would be hella slow due to high difficulty. And it wouldn't be clear if you can exchange those ""bitcoins"" for cash, since exchanges might not support them

The other interesting factor is altcoins: since the most liquid markets are paired with bitcoin last time I checked, two bitcoins crashing in price could pump alts to higher than bitcoin prices. And then exchanges would also have to decide in btc pairs which bitcoin to actually use.

"Yes, Satoshi did write this in the section on Proof-of-Work. But the ""majority decision"" under discussion was the limited one of which chain represents the true ledger (as opposed to one mined by attackers trying to roll back blocks):

> If a majority of CPU power is controlled by honest nodes, the honest chain will grow the fastest and outpace any competing chains.  To modify a past block, an attacker would have to redo the proof-of-work of the block and all blocks after it and then catch up with and surpass the work of the honest nodes.  We will show later that the probability of a slower attacker catching up diminishes exponentially as subsequent blocks are added.
