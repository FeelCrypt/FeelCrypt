"I dunno, 1x is likely to find its hash rate and thus transaction rate drop through the floor the next day, to something like two weeks between blocks found. This would be disastrous.

They'd have to HF just to keep their chain alive at all. 

Meanwhile, transactions being broadcast on the network would complete just fine on the 2x chain.

Which means all utility had passed into 2x leaving 1x stranded.

A coin with less utility, 1x, won't surpass one with more utility.

It's Core's fault for banking on keeping Bitcoin crippled just to push people into lightning.

Core's best move is to HF 2x into core too.";1;0;False;Anen-o-me;dnqeyat;I just bet 1,000 BTC (~$4M USD) that Segwit 2X coin will have more value than Segwit 1x coin.;https://twitter.com/rogerkver/status/913870930815807488

"Roger, I'd like to invite you to bet me 10 BCC or (soon to be worthless) Legacy-BTC that you won't be able to send 10 BCC or BTC to the address below. Rules: if you do manage to be able to send 10 of either coin the this address, YOU win and I will send you 10 BCC, if you fail to send the coins, then I win and you send me 10 BCC.

If there even is two coins after the fork, one will have to add replay protection and maybe even a POW change. Where will you be able to sell the BTCLOS coins? The idea really is that that fork is wiped out, you’d basically have nothing to sell.;2;0;False;Devar0;dnqollq;I just bet 1,000 BTC (~$4M USD) that Segwit 2X coin will have more value than Segwit 1x coin.;https://twitter.com/rogerkver/status/913870930815807488
