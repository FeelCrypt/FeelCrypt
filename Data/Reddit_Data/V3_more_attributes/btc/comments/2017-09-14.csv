This showcases a very big issue that is getting drowned in all the hype. A deflationary currency deincentivises spending, which in turn deincentivises productivity and investment.

You seem to be implying this is a bad thing. I would argue it's bad the central banks are running the printing presses like they are going out of style (they are). Lord knows when they come out with their own digital currency they will try and include the same features and we would be fools to use it over a decentralized currency. ;1;0;False;trillinair;dmzske6;Just bought some beers with Bitcoin Cash in Fuzhou, China!;https://i.imgur.com/CpSYpFn.jpg

The sign of when the bank run is starting is when people start buying any and all cryptos with tethers in order to pass the hot potato to somebody else. ;1;0;False;Digitsu;dmzzp37;As 20m more Tether are issued today, I think it's important for people to know that an unbacked Tether could be a big reason for the recent bitcoin price rise.
