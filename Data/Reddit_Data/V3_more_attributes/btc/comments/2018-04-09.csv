"> I understand assets distributed to shareholders also need to be liquidated so taxes can be properly assessed.       
       
False. Bankruptcy liquidation is made till all creditors are been paid, afterwards, there is no more bankrupty and cort/trustee does not have any busines authority on corporation anymore, but ""new"" appointed ceo or proprietorship. So no court can force corporation to liquidate remaining intangible assets (btc+forks) in order to have possible corporate capital gains, what in turn are then shared with shareholders if they requested it (they can decide assets to remain in the corporation). Full asset are liquidated only in the case there is no enough funds to settle all creditors and these asset can't be sold partialy, but at full. (Btc as intangible asset can be sold as incriment or partialy as opposed to the other intangible assets: trademark, copyright, blueprint, internet domain, patent, software, trade secret, etc.).                 
Esentually,  major difference in CR from current bankruptcy is to allow remaining btc to be distributed to the creditors, not to be settled with curent claims 485$ btc evaluation + fiat exchanged and distributed as JPY what make bankruptcy completed, and not to remain as corporation untangible asset where shareholders can get trough dividends if liquidated. Actually, liqidated btc are first mtgox capital gain, corporate annual income taxed, then transfered to the Tibanne (not taxable as asset transfer is to the parent company) what can be further distributed to the Mark as a dividend payout as 100% Tibanne owner (if he want or he can leave it as Tibanne asset. Naturally, that to be possible, Tibanne must complete their bankruptcy). Btc as untangible assets does not make direct dividends or interest, but its capital gain what can be used either to increase corporation equity (investment) capital or as profit/loss eglible to the possible corporate annual income tax (if corporation have income (depend on loss and deductables) and then sent as dividends to the shareholders.       
      
Beside, even with current straight bankruptcy, trustee can address the court based on finance analysis and cuncil for new evaluations of intangible assets(btc) due to price violity and significant asset value increase, what if approved, with current straight bankrupty btc+forks must be sold to pay all creditors with updated and new evaluated claims. On another hand, only if CR and plan is approved, these btc and forks can be distributed unexchanged (unliquidated) to the creditors.
      
       
**Worst case scenario:** Court settle all creditors claim with current evaluated btc (483$) where only enough intangible assets (btc) are liquidated (sold) to settle all creditors (what are almost already done), what makes bunkruptcy completed and reamining 165k btc and forks remain as Mtgox intangible asset where they can do whatever they want, liquidate and pay dividends, trade with btc, invest in other projects etc (bankruptcy is over, no obligation or liabilities to MtGox creditors).       
**Little better scenario:** Court accept new btc evaluation, but then these to be paid, all (or better to say) suficient remaining btc need to be sold(liquidate) to settle new evaluated creditor claims and question is how much liquid asset (funds) creditors would receive due crushing the btc price. Eventual btc+forks surplus what would be significantly lower then in worst case scenario (btc+forks surplus would depend on new btc price evaluation for creditor claims and difference in new total claimed sum vs. what trustee get from actual btc liquidation), would remain as MtGox intangible asset, they can do whatever they want - bankruptcy is completed.               
**Best scenario:** Civil rehabilitation under supervision with approved plan where creditors can claim all remaining btc+ forks unexchanged (not liquidated) + what is already liquidated.

"I appreciate your confusion. The forum is for confirmed creditors. At the moment the only way we have of sifting actual creditors from timewasters is to ask for a contribution. That's a terrible way of doing it. So we were asking for help from people with a list of creditor email addresses, so that we can send them an invitation link for them to join for free. 

It's a fair to think, when viewed from the outside, that we've been pretty ineffectual. Filing for CR is a paper exercise that takes little to do. Actually it was a bit risky to file it so hastily, but it all worked out in the end. The real hard work was done canvassing Ito with powerful legal arguments from authorities (a former judge and a legal scholar). That work was done by our lawyer at our expense. Thankfully Ito recommended CR to the court. The next step is getting the court to accept HOW they can move from Bankruptcy to CR. Again we're canvassing Kobayashi (our laywers meet with him on Thursday) to work with him on an opinion to submit to the court. 

We're also working with the other legal team to get this opinion to the court. https://www.mtgoxlegal.com/2018/04/09/survey-for-fukuoka-sensei/
FYI, they aren't a creditor group, they are funded by one creditor, who is well intentioned and open to dialogue with us, but isn't looking to have creditors join them and share the decision making and information like we are.

Our lawyers have different styles and approaches. Both in turn have helped advance the cause of creditors. It doesn't matter to me which one wins, as long as creditors win.

In practice the foundations for the decisions on how CR will eventually be managed are being set now. That's why I'd like more creditors involved in the dialogue of how we do that.

"I agree that it's a brand, the real issue in question is who is the owner. In my mind, it's just an internet free-for-all and that's what it's got to be in this decentralized world. There's (rightfully) no foundation or official leadership organization that can claim ownership, so there's really no legitimacy, IMHO, to disputing the usage of the name as a scam because you disagree with the account owner's interpretation of what bitcoin is.

One group (or individual) owns bitcoin.com, another bitcoin.org, another @bitcoin, and another owns the github repo. These people or groups don't all agree on what is or isn't bitcoin, and thats _fine_. That's part of the beauty (and sometimes curse) of a decentralized network.

Personally I agree with the idea that we shouldn't confuse people and try to call bitcoin cash bitcoin. (at least) two groups disagreed about the direction the coin should go, and both created changes to it to suit their needs. One of these groups is larger and owns the github repo, so I think it's fine that they get to keep the name ""bitcoin"", but that doesn't give them the right to refuse anyone else use it. In order to reduce confusion, someone came up with the idea to add ""cash"" to the end of one of the versions to emphasize it's purpose and ideology.

"> Hubs are a fiction entirely created by Lightning detractors.

Yeah, of course. [Hubs are just fiction](https://lnmainnet.gaben.win). 😅

>These may also be hidden.

Read the article.

>Another step developers plan to look into in the long term, he said, is making both components - the marketplaces and the watchtowers - invisible to bitcoin users.

>""Ideally within our application, this is all abstracted away from the end user,"" Osuntokun said, though he added the goal is still to make it easy for ""power users"" with more tech experience to construct and run their own towers.

>But if the Lightning Network becomes the go-to channel for everyday bitcoin transactions, this vigilance would become quite burdensome. As such, the watchtower concept allows users to outsource the ""eternal vigilance"" to other entities, who will send users a message should something look awry.

Since Lightning Network can't scale on-chain and become trustless, they have to outsource that to a third party. It destroys the point of the blockchain in the first place. Bitcoin was invented to circumvent the third party.

So now we have a sidechain where it is coded into the protocol that third parties will get paid to surveil the network. But you said it won't ""invade your privacy""! Obviously a hub will have enough power of itself to surveil, but nothing wrong with just controlling and surveilling your own channels. 

>False. Lightning runs on top of and requires Bitcoin. It can remove nothing, but it can (and does) add value.

LN piggybacks and steals profits and censorship resistance given from miners. If it didn't, why wouldn't we just have one miner mining and do all of our transactions on LN, since all it does is just ""add value"".

>False. The user would just force close the channel and receive their funds back. There is also nothing stopping them from opening additional channels to other nodes (or even merchants directly).

So you believe that LN won't turn into a centralized system controlled by a few actors who obviously provide KYC and whatever else the government or banks want?  Given it doesn't turn out to be complete vaporware of course?  But I can give you that it might not be that easy to reverse transactions, for that you would need to fork. But transactions are already irreversible onchain, so no news there.

> False. Every full node verifies that nobody creates new bitcoin except by the pre-defined rules. Fractional reserve banking is impossible on Bitcoin, unless the rules change to allow it (I would never allow such a thing, even if that means my node splits from the rest of the network).

Maybe you should read up on the definition? 

**Fractional-reserve banking is the practice whereby a bank accepts deposits, makes loans or investments, but is required to hold reserves equal to only a fraction of its deposit liabilities.**

Just because I go into a bank that practices fractional-reserve banking and owns 1 dollar and they give me 10 dollars doesn't mean that they **exist**. That is the whole point of it. They are lending you money that doesn't exist, and they are allowed to because..? 

>Can you explain how exactly unbacked USDT makes BTC fractional reserve? That makes zero sense.

I guess I should have said blockchain and not Bitcoin. I used Tether as an example, and using USD instead of BTC wouldn't change much. 

It isn't possible to do fractional reserve banking on the layer itself since every transaction on LN is a **potential** transaction onchain, so you would need to do another layer (which seems plausible). 

There will however be a slight problem when people want to be a part of the new hub and they suddenly don't get to control the private keys, or when the LN hubs suddenly starts issueing IOUs, like checks and whatnot. Going to your local hub and asking for a check to pay for things would be convinient when the on-chain transaction costs approaches $100 USD. 😅

to address your other point, what you say may be true that the original intention may have been more like the current intention of bch.

It may have adapted and changed to current market forces or because of internal business decisions or whatever reason. It's the norm for a business to change directions to adapt to the market. It's still disingenuous and I would say illegal to steal the name brand of of the original bitcoin. it's not and should not try to pretend it's the original bitcoin. It's an offshoot that may be trying to go back to the original intents of the founders of bitcoin. If this was the official bch slogan and outcry, I would be behind it 100% but it's not. It claims that it's the original bitcoin and tries to confuse people through shady tactics into believing that it's the original brand.

I'm pulling relevant facts -- from the article that this thread is about. Again, as I said before, I have no problem with using bitcoin in the name as it's is a fork. My problem is in bch trying to steal the brand of bitcoin in an attempt to gain popularity and market share (and in unscrupulous ways) to make a false claim that it is the true and/or original bitcoin. It's not. This is fake news 101. Making the claim twitter is a cesspool is a strawman argument. It is another example of bch trying to usurp btc. bitcoin is not a trademark becuase crypto is the wild west. bitcoin cash is a different name bit tries very hard to minimize or even directly hide the cash part of the name just as it tries to minimize the name bitcoin for the original by calling it bcore or core whatever other variable without actually saying bitcoin. I don't know anything about Jihan Wu so I can't comment on any direction of him but if bch was clear that it's a fork with a different name than I would be behind this 100% but it's clearly not the community or bch leadership position to do this.

"> Ethereum's orphan work is not wasted.

That depends on how you define ""waste"".

Miners mining uncles gets rewarded, and uncle rewards make the network stronger against attacks.  In that blog entry from 2014, Buterin asserts the network should work fine even with a 95% uncle rate.

That was his theory back in 2014, fast-forward to 2017 and things have actually been stress-tested, and the community find a 30% uncle rate as problematic.  Geographical location still plays a big part in reward distribution.  Uncles costs resources as they should be propagated, validated, rewarded and archived - their contribution to the transactional bandwidth of the network is negative.

> the state of fast ETH confirmations is not quite as [bad] as the comment suggests.

This is based on my own experiences, during the most congested times.  Of course things varies dependent on what wallet software was used and weather the the sender is trying to save on the fees or not - but in general, the probability that an outbound ethereum transaction will fail is very much higher than the probability that a BCH transaction will fail - and for the ordinary users, I believe it's harder to relate to ""gas price"" and ""gas limit"" than ""fee pr byte"" or ""fee"".

"Not who you replied to, but one difference is the staking itself. With mining, we see that miners can immediately sell the coin thru mine for either fiat or another coin so while they do have incentive to profit, that doesn't mean they need to support a coin long term if thier hardware will work on other chains.

With dash or similar staking coins, the masternode operators have a lot of capital locked up in the master node itself, so in order to vote in something ""bad"" they are risking a lot more.
