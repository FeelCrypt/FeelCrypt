"I'm a Bitpay customer and I'm fed up with paying a $1 transaction fee for buying a $5 game or a $10 domain registration.

Bitpay is what makes Bitcoin useful to consumers and has a lot of weight in this discussion.

Bitpay could speed up resolution of the impasse by indicating that they will consider alternatives, say Ether, if the impasse continues and transaction fees stay sky high. 

That would be the real wakeup call for those happy to see Bitcoin stalled at 1MB forever.

And really, what's the alternative? $2 fees for bitpay transactions indefinitely? That's bad for Bitpay, bad for its customers, bad for Bitcoin.

I don't think so. Once it has been shown that a hardfork is safe, and that miners can pull it off, good luck preventing it from happening again. That is why Core/Blockstream are so eager to prevent it at all cost.

There no clear straightforward relationship between decentralisation and cost for user.

do you understand that even if the blocksize limit variable was set to 32mb today, and everyone updated with no drama, the **ACTUAL** amount of data in each block would not fill up all 32mb?

saying 8mb is a terrible idea is based on the notion that the blockchain would immediately be 8x bigger. This isn't and won't be the case. realistically, we're probably closer to 2-3mb worth of transactions per block. so 8mb seems sane in regards to the amount of time it would buy us.

"Exchanges would likely offer both coins. If the 1 MB chain had more hashpower, the ""big block"" chain would never happen since the ""small"" chain is valid under ""big block"" rules too.

If the ""big block"" chain had a bit more hashpower, it would be a dangerous clusterfuck (because if the hashpower ratio changed, the big block chain could disappear).

If the ""big block"" chain had significantly more hashpower, the ""small"" chain would become much slower, increasing pressure and reducing usefulness. Depending on how extreme the hashpower disparity would be, it could make the ""small"" chain unviable. If miners decided that the small chain will have less value than the ""big"" chain, they'd probably quickly abandon it, crashing it completely. If the small chain survived until the next difficulty adjustment, things would get a lot more interesting (dangerous) - if the small chain became more valuable, miners could switch back, triggering the previous scenario. This can be made much more interesting by big holders selling large amounts of the ""wrong"" coin to tank its price and discourage miners.

What would be needed for a successful hard fork is either strong support from major payment providers (and/or holders) for a fork (which would incentivize miners to stick with the big chain), or overwhelming support by large miners. If 75% of hashpower decides that the hard fork is happening and sticks with that decision, it is happening. They could even spend a fraction of their hashpower to 51% attack the small block chain with empty blocks with spoofed timestamps.
