"So good no one is going to censor me here. So I have a very special proposal for you.

I want to make a Bitcoin like BU but with 1 min blocktime. I will call it Bitcoin Unlimited Ultimate.
Who is with me? Lets make it happen. Freedom for all. Lets make Bitcoin Great again!
We are against Core. They are mean and want to have all the Bitcoins for themselve. We want happiness and Bitcoins for all!
Soon we want to go to Slush asking them to support us. We are going to be huuuge! BUU forever!";1;0;False;bitheyho;dbbcf72;John Blocke: A (brief and incomplete) history of censorship in /r/Bitcoin;https://medium.com/@johnblocke/a-brief-and-incomplete-history-of-censorship-in-r-bitcoin-c85a290fe43#.e4gz25xy9
