"Whoever you think is more deserving of the name is irrelevant. As I said I support BCH over core and think it is much closer to the ‘original bitcoin’, so I agree with you.

But, this is an argument over semantics.  No one “stole” the name from anyone. That is a fact.

They may not deserve the name and they may not have acquired it in the most fair way, but again *no one stole it*, so stop repeating this bullshit without really thinking about it.

It’s kinda like saying Trump stole the presidency. No, he won it. He may not deserve it and it’s obviously unfortunate that he won, and he may have used unfair practices and propaganda to do so, but he didn’t steal the presidency and he is still the president whether he should be or not. You can kind of equate that to this situation.

"Core intentionally broadcasted wrong information about bitcoin: for example about nonmining fullnodes. This is a reason why people think LN is good for Bitcoin. So when I say they ""stole"" the name Bitcoin, I mean they got it trough broadcasting wrong information, propaganda and censorship. They would not have the communitysupport and the brand if they didn't do propaganda and censorship.

">Its like Hitler winning in 1933.

It's like almost any battle between two sides where large communities of people are involved.

Whoever manages to slander the other side and push false propaganda more effectively will win by swaying the most people. I'm sure BCH used some similar tactics to help gain traction on their side too.

Saying that core stole the name implies a lot of things that aren't necessarily true, especially to those who aren't as informed.

>I mean they got it trough broadcasting wrong information, propaganda and censorship.

This is pretty much how everything is achieved these days, unfortunately... That's why I referenced the US presidency as a comparison. And yeah, I don't like it either.";3;1;False;Quarenvale;e1nji0m;😂😂😂;https://i.redd.it/zk6r99538h711.png

"It is true that many people, including myself, invested in a bunch of shitty cryptocurrencies when they first came in to this space. This is no surprise considering the fact that now for the first time in human history, almost any individual around the world has the opportunity to invest in a revolutionary technology.

Before cryptocurrencies, investment was limited to regulated exchanges/technologies/firms. If you treat the entire world as children by telling them what they can and can't do with their money, of course these people will never get a chance to grow up and face the consequences of their own decisions. 

One of the interesting side effects of cryptocurrencies, apart from it separating money and state, is that it's forcing people to educate themselves in economics, investing & responsibilities. Alternatively people can put part of their wealth in a cryptocurrency investment fund and pay someone else to do the due diligence. However, the individual himself will still need to make a good judgement call on which fund to join.

I personally don't believe making memes like this is going to help the space a lot. I think it will mainly create a divide between the maximalists and the more open minded people. I think if you really want people to make better judgement calls you should enhance the projects that you support or create a better one yourself, and advocate for those.

Moreover, I think it's not even clear what defines Bitcoin. Is it the chain with the most accumulated proof of work, or the chain that best resembles peer-to-peer electronic cash? I think both have compelling arguments. Considering that there is still a very large proportion of the market that thinks the former, one could argue that Bitcoin Cash is just another altcoin. I think the term altcoin shouldn't even be used. As if there can only be one true cryptocurrency and the rest is fundamentally different. How can you hold those views and at the same time believe in open-source projects and free market competition?";4;0;False;RavenDothKnow;e1nbx9l;😂😂😂;https://i.redd.it/zk6r99538h711.png
