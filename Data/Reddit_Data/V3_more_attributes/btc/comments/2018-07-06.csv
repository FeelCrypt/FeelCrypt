  Bitcoin can handle only seven transactions a second (against Visa‚Äôs ten thousand), for instance, all because of an explicit hard limit on the amount of data that can go into a transaction block. That limit will need to be raised significantly if the system is to be expanded to include all these other value exchanges in addition to bitcoin payments.   Almost all is tethered to Bitcoin in some capacity, following what Bitcoin does in the medium term. It‚Äôs this consistent observation that should be shaping our portfolios. Bitcoin should be treated as the core coin. The one we turn to. Due to btc I ve got to know about the platform which totally suits my need because of fast tps - Credits. The coin to help realize our dream of an incorruptible and technologically advanced transfer of value from citizen to citizen, without the needless bloat. ;1;0;False;BleedingUnicorn;e1weyko;You guys were so nice to me so I thought I'd make a green one for you;https://i.redd.it/l4lfsnverx711.gif

I think you need to re-read this thread:

https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=994.msg12168#msg12168

When BTC was worth $0.06 the suggested fee for large transactions was 0.01 BTC (0.06 * 0.01) = **$0.0006, or six one-hundredths of one cent, TOTAL.**

Satoshi said of the limit:

>I think it should be lowered to 50KB per block.  That would still be **more than 100 times the average transactions per block.**

So there we have a general framework that the blocksize was designed to be ""more than 100 times the average transactions per block.""

Bitcoin cash is using the bitcoin name because it is bitcoin. It's an unbroken chain of blocks from the bitcoin genesis block with the workable scaling plan Satoshi devised. What's calling itself bitcoin right now isn't actually bitcoin. Segwit breaks the concept of coins being tracable back to their creation event in all nodes. RBF breaks fast transfers.

"I've removed stickers in public places before (one example is an antifa stickers I've seen stuck on traffic lights). I'm astounded at the piss-poor job this individual has at removing that sticker. Like, seriously, all it usually takes is to take a pen and to use it to pick at the corners, the rest usually peels off. If someone's really triggered, and the sticker is really hard to remove, they could go as far as to get a razor blade and use that to scrape off the entire sticker. 

But the fact someone got so pissy, not at the fact the sticker is there, but at the fact the sticker is promotes Bitcoin Cash, they actually went through the effort of scratching out the what's on the sticker as opposed to making any effort to actually removing the sticker. 

That's just brilliant.
