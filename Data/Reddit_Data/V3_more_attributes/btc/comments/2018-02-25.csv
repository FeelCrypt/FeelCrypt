You’re looking at it one sided. The original unspent outputs must exist first, before being used as inputs. Making the change the exact same as before batched or individual for for 100 transactions. Batching does not change the amount of change, even with multiple batched transactions that are 100.

"The number of outputs **per single transaction** raises... that is correct... if you batch 1,000 transactions into 10, each single transaction has 100 receiver outputs. It also goes from 1,000 transactions with 1 change output each to 10 transactions with 1 change output each.

Therefore in that case, you dropped transactions by 990 (from 1,000 to 10) and outputs also by 990 (from 2,000 to 1,010 since each batch transaction has 100 receiver outputs and 1 change output)

I’m on my phone so it’s hard to do a thorough comparison but last 24hrs Bitcoin did 152,878 transactions. Ethereum did 730,528. Ripple has done 931,527 and i know steem and bitshares average over a million. So bitcoin tx volume is barely top 5 at *best*. The reason tx fees have gone down is because not as many transactions are happening on btc network (because it was so expensive). That’s what the fee is for, to make it expensive so fewer people spam the network. In bitcoins case, even sincere txs qualify as spam due to exorbitant fees.

"> the only difference in byte sizes between a single payment and a batched payment is the number of non-change outputs

You're talking about individual transactions. Yes, a batched transaction which batches together (for example) 100 normal transactions has the same number of change outputs as the original transactions, while having a different number of non-change outputs than each individual original transaction.

But when you consider the overall change, you've removed 99 transactions out of the 100. Those original 100 had two outputs (one to the receiver which is the non-change output, and one that is the change output) and you only need the one change output in the batch transaction, so you've gone from having 200 total outputs to 101.

You lowered transactions from 100 to 1, and outputs from 200 to 101... each lowered by 99.";1;1;False;Korberos;dus9afo;BTC mempool just cleared out for the first time in 3 months!;https://i.redd.it/hfc3lhwhuph01.png

"> Batch transactions don’t reduce the change outputs. They reduce the number of non-change outputs.

How do you figure? If I have an address that I'm sending money to 1,000 people from, and I'm not batching, each of the 1,000 transactions has a change output in addition to the receiver output. 2000 outputs total.

If you batch those 1,000 transactions into 10 with 100 receiver outputs each, you only need 1 change output each, bringing your total outputs from 2,000 to 1,010.

You just lowered transactions by 990 (1000 to 10) and change outputs by 990 (1000 to 10)
