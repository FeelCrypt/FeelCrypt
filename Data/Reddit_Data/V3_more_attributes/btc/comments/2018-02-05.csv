 Listen I have never ever been involved in the buying or selling of crypto but been hoping to see how the tech improves. Its rise and fall is not always due to government talk but also due to it's inability to function as a currency at the moment. For now these currencies are get rich quick scheme's, not actually currencies. Bitcoin Cash does seem to try to fix it with their own little fix but that does not help much.

Bit coin was never illegal, it was legal, but it's usage in the black market was in a grey area. Your blind love for a currency that has not truly seen it's final potential is absurd. The tech has not matured and we are still in infancy. If cryptos do not fix their issues soon, an alt-coin one likely forwarded by the government and trust me many government have been looking into it will succeed.

"> True democracy does not work

So you're why crypto dips every time a government somewhere vaguely gesticulates at banning it, lol! Why are you here at all then? Why not go buy the Petro? Hey, do you remember that law every country passed in 2008 legalizing any random person forming private unregistered banks in their own home? No? That's because there was no such law and cryptocurrency is and always has been riotously illegal. If you would leave if it was banned, then you should leave right now, because it was never allowed. Bye! Enjoy serving your masters! Tell them hi for us, tell them it won't be long now! :)";0;1;False;mungojelly;dtrw191;"Government: ""Cryptocurrencies are too risky.""

"[Liquid democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegative_democracy) is what you're looking for.  Allows the best features of representative democracy (I don't know/care about this so someone else I nominate can represent me), direct democracy (I know/care so much about this I'll vote directly), and everything in-between.  

* Backwards compatible with the current system - pick a 'default' representative just like you do now every few years.  But change your default whenever you like - that kind of accountability can only drive representatives to represent the voter before their monied lobbyists.  
* Fully granular - nominate your representative on a per-issue basis ensures your viewpoint is always accurately represented.  
* Truly representative decisions - delegates vote carrying the weight of their accumulated votes.  
* Public key cryptography to ensure privacy/anonymity.
* On a blockchain ensures transparency.

Democracy today hasn't progressed much since a time the fastest information travelled was by horse.

"A centralized system areany forms not just North Korea, but whatever system we create always lead to that until we hit a post scarcity world.

Every system we have had has a top down approach from the Senate in Rome to the feudal system of England, including the parliamentary system.

The problem is people usually wants some form of stability and confidence. Plus peace is an important factor in this case. The ability to rely on certain expectations sees that a nation actually has investment and growth, but the moment instability occurs people worry and start locking up their wealth. Trying to enforce peace is hard and usually requires force in a sense, not physical force but just the concept of if you create chaos or disrupt the society you will be punished.

Second issue is how to write laws and deal with foreign and domestic affairs, you need someone who is capable in those jobs, this would likely lead to alot of experts being hired to help manage them. Now who decides who is an expert on this topic. And once decided the expert now has control over a part of the country.

But the biggest issue of all is people worship leaders, leaders they see as infallible and pure. Even if they preach individualism the very person will still follow most of.the time lock and step with their leaders. The most obvious example is Trump and his followers who follow his every move no matter how much it changes from the initial policy or statement. No matter if it is bad or good. If dear leader said it, it is good. Same in Korea and elsewhere. Not only this those who do dissent are looking for someone to rally behind at all times to fight against their oppressors. People for some reason want someone with confidence and belief to follow.

Why assassinating a leader or an officer could decide a battle or war.";2;0;False;Risay117;dts73g2;"Government: ""Cryptocurrencies are too risky."" Also government: ""Buy lottery tickets.""";https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7vctu9/government_cryptocurrencies_are_too_risky_also/

"An elite group or a system is currently needed, the current system is based on us selecting representatives for our community to sit in a government. The problem is how it is organized and the checks and balances behind it.

What is another system? True democracy does not work, a system based on machine? How does that represent what the people want? You also have a significant population who is illiterate on alot of subjects from trade to economics and then military and social policies. If you relied on the average person, there will never be any clear direction as people are inherently reactionary leading to a change of direction in overall policy alot more often than normal. This becomes highly inefficient and can lead to some bad results.

The second problem is how do we decide when laws should be changed, and how does one write and propose it. A bill is not just some simple law it has alot of detail and legal speak behind it. 

But ignoring all that, whatever system we create the will always be the elite, as they will always have control on which direction to go and how the system is set up. Also because people want someone to show them the way.

Ok, right, in october yes, i may be wrong about the month, then same example with september and june.

"**Dinosaur**

Dinosaurs are a diverse group of reptiles of the clade Dinosauria. They first appeared during the Triassic period, between 243 and 231 million years ago, although the exact origin and timing of the evolution of dinosaurs is the subject of active research. They became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates after the Triassic–Jurassic extinction event 201 million years ago; their dominance continued through the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. The fossil record indicates that birds are modern feathered dinosaurs, having evolved from earlier theropods during the late Jurassic Period.

That is not completely true, just look at the charts at blockchain.info, it is true the tx count and volume is lower than 1-2 months ago, but 1-2 months ago there was an extreme peak of usage. If you look at the mean of these charts [it is clearly visible the usage is in growing trend, just the deviation is higher](https://blockchain.info/charts/n-transactions?timespan=all). 3 weeks ago we still had around 300,000 tx/day, and I could transact with low fee, but since SW and LN is in the picture, it is way lower. If the low price and volume would  cause lower usage and lower fees, then why wasn't it possible to send transaction in october for the same fee like now, when the price was even lower?

You know, my problem is even if this is true, nobody can prove it for me, because on BCH side behaviour i see only the attack only the propaganda, and only the forceful convincing about and idea, but many times what i read i personally know is not true. Even tho if not everything is a lie, a lot of things are. On the other side of course there are immature people too, who attack BCH for fun, but the most of them and even the so called corps does not do any propaganda and never push us to use what they represent. It will be very hard to convince somebody about truth with attacks, force, 24/7 propaganda when on the other side still feels having the free choice what to use and what to do. Btw i usually transact very rarely but then a huge amount so i don't use SW either LN, and even the high fee is just acceptable for me, so these reasons will not make me chose another coin when the base of my tradings in BTC since years. So the point is, there are too many paradoxes around both coins, but BCH side just seems a bit more violent, that makes it a bit hollow.;1;0;False;gecikopter;dtrmh70;As requested, a picture of a dinosaur holding Bitcoin, while mammals are poised to adapt for the future;https://i.redd.it/72qgbct2x6e01.jpg
