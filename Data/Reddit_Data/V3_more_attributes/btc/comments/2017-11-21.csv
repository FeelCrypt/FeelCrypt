"It's suspicious to me that all this documented evidence starts around 11/14. Starting somewhere around 11/10 BCH experienced a gigantic run up and spike in volume, culminating in a price on 11/12 that was ~300% higher than it was just a few days prior. 

I don't know how, exactly, but this vote manipulation has to play into something bigger than just ""an attempt to make it seem like BCH supporters were evil"". 

Tinfoil hat theories - either this vote manipulation started even earlier, somewhere around 11/10, but OP wasn't able to find evidence for that.

"In this particular case, the use of hacked reddit accounts is what is criminal.  If they had just created a bunch of fake accounts with fake emails you would be right.  Hacking a person's account is a major federal crime under Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Fraud_and_Abuse_Act

Before the Community split into Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Cash people tried to get the block sized raised in other ways.  One of these was by making alternative nodes that included the block size increase and then encouraging miners to run and support it.  The first attempt at this was Bitcoin XT, then Bitcoin Classic, and finally Bitcoin Unlimited.  These clients all operated on the legacy chain and if enough people/miners used them would have triggered an upgraded block size.

Core launched a public smear campaign against the alternative implementations and people running the alternative software experienced hacking attacks in the form of DDOS (flooding a server with fake requests from hacked computers until it crashes) and DOS attack via undisclosed exploits (Someone reviewed the code and found bugs that would cause the node to crash then used that to attack nodes and make them crash constantly instead of reporting the issue so it could be fixed)

Both DDOS and Exploit DOS attacks are very illegal under US and other countries laws.  It's hard to pin responsibility for stuff like that on any one person though unless you are law enforcement and have subpoena power.  We were suspicious that it was probably Core/Blockstream but they always brushed it off as conspiracy.

"**Theory**: the r/Bitcoin mods are feeling heat from the reddit admins because of the massive number of removals, censorship, bad PR, the stolen donations, etc.  Or they are anticipating such pressure in the future, as I know users here complain and the OP is compiling a very compelling database of data (in addition to the very clear and sourced Blocke articles).


They told the admins it was a necessity because of vote manipulation.  This is their way of proving that while scoring some brownie points for their users.


Your thoughts, /u/spez and /u/sodypop?  I'm a 10+ year redditor, I've talked to both you and kn0thing in person once, I was one of the first subscribers to Gold back when it was a pure donation and I donated quite a bit, etc.  I started and managed a community that evolved into a top 20 subreddit, which I modded for years (so I know the game, the tools, etc.).  I am not OK with what is going on in r/Bitcoin, and I am unable to comment there for my political views.  I have been accused of socking, botting, trolling, doxxing, etc. by those mods and I promise you I did none of the above.


In an age of media manipulation I find the services OP is providing invaluable.  To OP: I would support open sourcing all this data in full and allowing researchers to have at it.

"For years the Bitcoin developers were debating how to scale Bitcoin. One group of devs, the originals who the inventor of Bitcoin passed development onto when he left, wanted to increase the blocksize as was long the plan. Most of the community agree with this since it was the plan from the start. 

But a second group of devs who had worked their way into development were insisting... on doing nothing. Not scaling. No improving the network so more people could use it. Instead they wanted to transform Bitcoin into a settlement network and make it more like banking 2.0... rather than the P2P cash system it already was. When the original top dog dev Gaven Andresen stepped down from his power position... these new devs swept in and quickly filled the power vacuum, created a company called Blockstream, and usurped Bitcoin development. Within a year or so in August 2015 Theymos the mod of rbitcoin decided to ally with these new devs and censor anyone who disagreed with them instead of allowing for open debate. The community was immediately fragmented and divided.

"In recent times, this site has been politicised to the extreme, and even subs like /r/cringe which have nothing to do with politics have become havens for left-leaning users and mods to promote their ideology, abandoning the original objectives of those subreddits. Take a look at the top posts of /r/cringe to see this in action. We have also seen many of the default subs bought out by political interest groups like ShareBlue and the result is that an impartial opinion on /r/politics, /r/news or /r/worldnews is now non-existent, they are all just echo-chambers. 

  We have mods that moderate hundreds or thousands of subs. We see people being banned from subreddits they have never visited just because of their participation in another sub. We see mods abuse power to ban users from multiple subreddits for one infraction, or with no infractions in some cases. Often these bans come with no explanation and questioning them leads to simply being muted (why does this option exist?). We see a multitude of censored comments in any thread about a remotely sensitive topic.  

  It is clear that the administrators are happy to let these abuses of power persist and happy to let the site become a hyper-politicised safe-zone for liberals. We've seen the site's algorithms changed to target one specific sub which doesn't go along with the narrative, /r/The_Donald, hiding posts from that sub from the front page even though they were happy to let /r/SandersForPresident take over the front page during the 2016 primaries. We also saw an astonishing action taken by the CEO of reddit, Steve Huffman, where /r/The_Donald's users' comments were personally shadow-edited by Steve himself in an act of petty retaliation for the criticism he received, which says a lot about the type of character he is.  

  Finally, the direction the site has been taking lately is very discouraging, as they aim to become a new Facebook. We are now seeing Facebook-like user profiles and a Facebook-like card-view homepage to go along with the Facebook-like quality of content that reddit has sank to, and it looks like the mission to turn reddit into another social media site is well underway, making this a great time to leave.  

  As an act of protest, I have chosen to redact all the comments I've ever made on reddit, overwriting them with this annoying message. I've had some gilded comments, made some funny jokes, given some good advice and started pointless arguments, but now they will all be turned into this, as I delete my profile and take back every comment.

"I believe everything to be true as if you look at all the links and evidence it all backs up every claim made. Evidence is evidence. Whether people choose to willfully ignore it is on them, unfortunately. There are still plenty of people that will be brain washed coming from /r/bitcoin, BitcoinTalk, etc. 

Why this was done has become blatantly obvious. The mods of /r/bitcoin are clearly working with Blockstream employees/Core Devs to manipulate the market in their favor. We've seen this time and time again now for at least two years; but now there is evidence and facts to prove it and back it up. How Blockstream/Bitcoin Core devs were able to get /r/bitcoin mods in their back pocket, isn't yet known, but seems also painfully obvious being that Greg Maxwell and theymos have a long standing relationship going back to BitcoinTalk, Greg being a paid staffer there, theymos working with Warren Togami (Blockstream exec) on the Slickage forum embezzlement, and more. The rabbit hole goes very far down and this only scratches the surface. But for the first time we have actual proof that is undeniable that the two groups actively work together to manipulate the market.

I'm also highly skeptical of the tether scam happening right now and what role that plays with Bitfinex and Blockstream. That is still developing, but more news I'm sure will come of that in due time.

"That's still too side v. side for me. There are people with hundreds of millions of dollars on the line here. All that's happening is pumps and dumps and distractions so that everyone else is worried about /r/bitcoin vs. /r/btc. 

A large amount of the mining network switch over because of the broken difficulty adjustment algorithm in BCH. For those few days, BCH was something like 3x more profitable to mine. Also during that time, we saw the largest trading volumes of all time, with suspicious spikes where BCH was trading at 2x volume over all other coins on just a few exchanges. After the difficulty adjusted again, trading volume fell, and BCH/BTC price has been falling pretty consistently (albeit, slowly).

Look, what I'm saying is that people making these markets move and buying mods don't care about subreddit debates, and honestly, probably don't really care about tech discussions. There are fortunes being made while we bikeshed who is on the right side of the blocksize increase. 

That's my tinfoil hat theory, but think about it - would you put this kind of market manipulation and propaganda past the CEO's and billionaires that play in the conventional stock market? Why should we not assume it's happening here? That should be the default. These markets are even less regulated, more prone to error, and easier to move.

The sub is out of control and off topic and has been for awhile and the moderators have no interest in cleaning it up.

There is direct evidence the shilling for BCH in /r/btc is the product of the moderators of /r/btc themselves who have actual motive to push BCH where /r/bitcoin has none whatsoever.  It's not a false flag attack, it's an astroturfing operation to build support for BCH.  Go look at the volume of posts shilling for BCH in /r/btc.

"**False flag**

The contemporary term false flag describes covert operations that are designed to deceive in such a way that activities appear as though they are being carried out by individual entities, groups, or nations other than those who actually planned and executed them.

Lance deHaven-Smith states that ""The term “false flag” originally referred to pirate ships that flew flags of the home countries of the ships they were approaching to attack and board. The pirates used the false flag as a disguise to prevent their victims from fleeing or preparing for battle. The term today extends beyond naval encounters to include countries that organize attacks on themselves and make the attacks appear to be by enemy nations or terrorists, thus giving the nation that was supposedly attacked a pretext for domestic repression and foreign military aggression.""

Operations carried out during peace-time by civilian organizations, as well as covert government agencies, can (by extension) also be called false flag operations if they seek to hide the real organization behind an operation.

It's actually the opposite.  If one user controls two accounts, it's unlikely they'll post within *a few seconds* of each other. However, just by random chance, we'd expect two separately-controlled accounts to post within a few seconds of each other. (The exact expected minimum gap is shown.)

"Hi guys! Since I first made this reddit account a year and some change ago, it had been a small hope of mine that someone would toss an offhand comment accusing me of being Maxwell--but a whole thread? Really, thanks guys, you vastly exceeded my expectations. And 18 gilds on it as of writing, too!

At any rate, all I'll say in my ""defence"" is that I've followed Maxwell's posts on BCT and here since a while before I made this account because I like to learn from people who know their shit. I follow Adam Back's tweets too--yikes! Still waiting for the Blockstreamcore paychecks, but you know, blocks are full and all.

So yeah, believe whatever you want to believe. I am not Greg Maxwell. CSW is not Satoshi. Bitcoin Cash is not Bitcoin.

"This is merely scratching the surface. Any veteran programmer will tell you how easy it is to set up the code for bots. Just using a RNN, like say https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn can turn up enough semi-logical content to make some hard to automatically detect karma farming. And this isn’t even using anything remotely specialized. The fact is, if I could see myself be able to do this for fun (I am a veteran programmer), then for sure there’s team that are monetarily backed that have done the legwork already. Not that there’s that much to do. You can easily set up some pre-written conversation topics with some minor variations, code some fuzzy search and have bots automatically respond with your propaganda. You could even make the fuzzy search smarter than just regexes; plug in one of the many pre-existing libraries that do NLP. Again, very tough to detect an account that would do that, besides maybe using DNA sequencing algorithms to detect repeated patterns? Like there’s so many ways to do this that it’s not even funny. And soon enough we’ll have so much misinformation that we won’t be able to tell a real conversation from one that isn’t, kind of like r/politics. It’s the new spam of our age. It cost almost nothing to make, and the websites are wholly unequipped to filter it. And like spam, it isn’t that complicated to do.

"This thread looks bad. Not for u/nullc but more for r/btc. There simply isn't enough evidence to say that u/nullc is u/4n4n4. It's possible but there is NOT enough evidence. 

The reasoning behind removing the votes displayed limit by the r/Bitcoin moderator make sense. They don't prove anything.

It is possible that is was all a r/bitcoin conspiracy but it is equally possible that it was someone from r/btc who did that. There is nothing in this posts that provides much evidence for either things.

The upvotes and the number of times this post has been gilded makes me suspicious that most people here are merely wishing for it to be a r/bitcoin conspiracy, whether there be any evidence for it or not.

If anyone can dig deeper and prove anything about what happened with the account hacks, that would be welcome but I am afraid this post does not provide enough evidence for anything.

> Votes are never turned off. They are only temporarily hidden. I disabled this temporary hide feature (temporarily) so that people could see how blatant the manipulation was instead of just taking my word for it. But yes, the people behind this aren't too smart.

There's only one thread to read through.  Before compiling your evidence, just read the one thread all the way through to make sure you didn't miss anything.

My guess on the whole ""attack"" was that it was a poorly programmed bot going wild.  Likely the bot was programmed to downvote comments 20 times an hour and the programmer missed a decimal place on a timer and it went wild with 200 votes a second.

"Wow, epic, standing ovation! This confirms what we have suspected all along.  The criminal activity associated with Bitcoin Core / Blockstream goes all the way to the top.  If true this means that their CTO Greg Maxwell is at minimum complicit in criminal activity if not directly carrying it out or directing others to do so himself.

I've always been suspicious of the claim that the folks doing illegal things in the name of supporting Core are just some fanatics not directly associated with Core or Blockstream.  While people have been suspicious of Blockstream Core for a while this is the first time there is very direct and compelling evidence implicating Greg Maxwell.  Many of us assumed they were also behind the criminal attacks on XT, Classic, and Unlimited nodes but didn't have any proof.

Wingman is a role that a person may take when a friend needs support with approaching potential sexual or romantic partners. A wingman is someone who is on the ""inside"" and is used to help someone with intimate relationships. In general, one person's wingman will help him or her avoid attention from undesirable prospective partners or attract desirable ones, or both.

If I had money on 'finex that I wasn't actively trading, I would move it out.  If I had money that I was actively trading, I would probably move it out anyway, and then take the loss in form of missed opportunities if it all blows over.

We saw the Tethers move to a previously unknown address, some speculation and guesses as to whose address that is, and then saw the BTC price jump on Bitfinex. So it would fit if that was a bitfinex address (or a bitfinex user!) who used the newly deposited USDT to pump the price.

"How about the harm when people figure out Bitcoins have been bought with made up money and that a big chunk of the current market price might be made up too? And not just bitcoin, all crypto. 

Point is in the current eco system of exchanges there are many that accept tether. Now tether is 1/1 with the USD BUT you can't actually redeem it for USD. Basically Tether is saying: trust us guys, the USD is all there. Okay there you go here is 30M tether, go buy some coins on that exchange. Okay here you go you can have 60 M tether go buy some coins on that exchange. But has Tether received 90M USD? And how? What fiat bank is cooperating? Fiat banks don't like this new kid on the block and they do what banks have always done: they block access to whomever they want to block access too. 

So what happens? You have an eco system of exchange where it's not to hard to get USD in but very hard to take USD out. What happens when you keep pumping air in to a tire? It explodes. Nuff said. 

Gox 2.0 now with extra salt and 800% gains on drama. Poor souls that got in to bitcoin after the price skyrocketed from 5000 to over 8000 in like a month, their fear of missing out is going to make them miss out ... on their fiat money.

The duck test is a form of abductive reasoning. This is its usual expression:



If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck.



The test implies that a person can identify an unknown subject by observing that subject's habitual characteristics. It is sometimes used to counter abstruse, or even valid, arguments that something is not what it appears to be.

"> You can measure monetary deflation separately from price deflation. I've never seen a case where significant contraction in the supply of money didn't cause a recession. In either case price deflation also seems to be pretty bad for economies (or bad economies lead to price deflation).

Ok, but you're saying that price deflation (a general decline in prices) is bad for the economy. And I'm pointing out that price deflation can have at least two different causes: monetary deflation or economic growth. 

>How is that the logic? People already have inflationary currency and access to deflationary assets, we don't have to speculate on what they would do with it.

Ok, but your previous comment imagined a scenario where you had access to both an inflationary and a deflationary *currency*.  So I assumed you were imagining a scenario where the deflationary asset had become extremely widely-held and widely-accepted for payments (so as to earn the ""currency"" label). So in that scenario, if I hold both of these currencies and all the people I buy goods and services from accept both, sure my incentive is to first spend the inflationary currency.  But that's going to be everyone else's incentive too. If nobody wants to hold the inflationary currency, its value is going to collapse and it will cease to be money, having been completely eclipsed by the better, deflationary money.

 >Money doesn't need to be a good ""store of value"" because money has no value except for helping exchange value. 

Ok but again, I think this is like saying that buckets don't need to be non-leaky because they're for transferring water, not storing it.  

>Money under a matress for 20 years is not generating value regardless of whether the money supply is inflating or deflating.

But again, think about what that money represents. It represents your ability to make an immediate claim on real resources.  When you don't exercise that claim immediately (and instead stick the money under the mattress) those real resources remain available to be used by others for either consumption or investment. That forbearance on your part thus is generating value for others.

>People use money for consumption, not savings. When people want to save they use money to buy things that appreciate like property or stocks.

People use money for savings too. It's just that money in the form of fiat currencies is such a poor ""store of value"" that people attempting to save across longer time periods would be well-advised to use their money to acquire some other asset.  So they attempt to quickly pour some water from the leaky bucket into a non-leaky but difficult-to-pour bucket. Later when they want to access their savings, they pour some water from the difficult-to-pour bucket back into a leaky bucket and then enjoy some consumption by ""taking a drink"" (buying some good or service). Of course, this only provides a net benefit if the amount spilled by the transfers is less than the amount that would have leaked away had the water just been kept in the leaky bucket. But again, what you'd really like is a bucket that doesn't leak or spill.

>A currency that people don't want to spend and just hoard isn't a good currency, its a deflationary asset, of which there are already many that have lots of other uses.

But creating a money that people are willing to spend isn't the hard part.  Of course people want to spend money. In most cases, that's all it's ultimately good for, facilitating exchange.  (You can't eat bitcoins.)  The tricky part is creating a money that people are willing to accept and hold.  And yes, there are lots of assets that are deflationary (expected to hold or increase in value over time) but there aren't lots of such assets that *also* have very low transactional friction.

>There is a strange, unexamined circular logic behind bitcoin proponents that says all the problems with bitcoins adoption as a functional currency because it was never intended to be a currency and its narrow minded to think that's all bitcoin can be. Then when asked to justify why its actually valuable, and why what we're seeing isn't just a spiral of speculators looking to profit from increasing price rises caused by , then it suddenly becomes a currency again, even though all the arguments for why bitcoin isn't a good currency were dismissed with ""well yeah its not meant to be a currency"".

Bitcoin IS intended to be a currency. But it obviously couldn't happen overnight.   The transition from (a) totally obscure computer science experiment (where it started in 2009) to (b) the most widely-held and readily-traded-for good  is going to take some time. I'd say the progress toward that goal has been pretty darn impressive but there's still a long way to ago. 

>Deflationary assets don't turn into currencies just because they hit a certain market cap.

Sure, the properties that make an asset ""deflationary"" aren't the only properties needed for it to succeed as money; it also needs to be extremely easy to transact.

"> The problem is that the witness data is not hashed into the block anymore

That bit's not true; the root of the witness data's merkle tree is included in the coinbase transaction of the block, which is part of the merkle tree for the transactions in the block, which is part of the block header. There is a provable link between the transaction merkle tree and the witness merkle tree via hashes. 

> so the signatures are no longer part of the block definition.

Clients don't get the witness data as part of the initial block's data, true. So the signatures aren't in the block's definition, they're now a separate ""witness data"" entity. So, it's moved somewhere else, but the link still exists in a provable way.

It's like the separation between a website's source (HTML) and its CSS/Javascript. CSS/Javascript can be embedded directly into the HTML document, so a web browser has to only make one fetch for the data, or they can be served separately, so the browser makes two fetches. The ""Website"" as an overall package is in multiple pieces, but it's still all there for browsers to fetch. Some browsers may opt to disable CSS/Javascript, and they can avoid that second network call, if they're happy getting an incomplete picture of the website. Websites typically don't have a verifiable link to the exact version of their CSS/Javascript, while Witness data does have such a link to the transaction data, so that's where the analogy breaks down.";1;0;False;MidnightLightning;dq5fh0c;"To the Censorship loving tyrants in /r/Bitcoin, don't Say Bitcoin.com didn't warn you!

"Why is it just BTC? I thought other crypto's were also traded in USD-T including BCH? Also, why was Roger Ver comfortable moving 120,000 BTC to Bitfinex, and why deal with that exchange in the first place when there are other options out there? Why not bittrex if the intent is to exchange BTC for BCH, coinbase for BTC to USD, or Kraken for BTC to BCH or USD?

I understand /r/bitcoin is heavily censored, blockstream is centralized, and there is a big dislike, but at times I wonder to what extent is all problems to be attributed to BTC. 

Even last week had me skeptical after the FUD spread around BTC and the FOMO spread on BCH leading people to buying high and selling low. I feel like a great degree of skeptisim for /r/bitcoin and /r/btc is warranted. Especially for people very new to the crypto game.

"For those with ad blockers

>Bitstamp, one of the oldest cryptocurrency exchanges, announced it will launch trading of Bitcoin Cash, a new currency that many Bitcoin supporters view as a rival.
>
>“We get requests from our users who want to trade it,” said Bitstamp CEO Nejc Kodric. “We want to be as agnostic as possible so we look at the system, and if we believe there is sufficient demand and there will be trading and trading volume, we’re going to list it.”
>
>Trading of Bitcoin Cash on Bitstamp, which is the third-largest in the world for U.S. dollar and euro trading of Bitcoin, begins in the next couple weeks. The move could indicate possible growing acceptance of a cryptocurrency that many hardcore Bitcoiners view as an unwanted stepchild of Bitcoin and potential threat to the top cryptocurrency.
>
>It's also significant because Bitstamp is one of the more conservative exchanges and currently only offers trading in the other four cryptocurrencies — Bitcoin, Ethereum's Ether, Litecoin and Ripple's XRP — that round out the top five by market capitalization. It was the first nationally licensed Bitcoin exchange, a designation that applied across all 28 European Union countries.
>
>The near-clone of Bitcoin was created in August by a group of Bitcoiners who disagree ideologically with the future development plans for the original cryptocurrency. They instead support a certain method for increasing the number of transactions that can be processed on the network at any given time that is generally known as “big blocks.” Bitcoin Cash currently has a market capitalization of $20 billion compared to Bitcoin’s $137 billion.
>
>Earlier in November, another so-called fork of Bitcoin was scheduled to occur that would have again created a new version of Bitcoin, this one containing elements of compromise for both camps across the ideological split. However, this plan, called SegWit2x, was called off, and so many of the ideologically driven big block supporters have instead begun pushing Bitcoin Cash.
>
>“There are still people out there who think Bitcoin should have larger blocks, and right now Bitcoin Cash provides them with exactly that,” said Kodric. “I think that’s why some of the demand emerged — SegWit2x didn’t happen, so some of the attention pivoted toward Bitcoin Cash.”
>
>Bitcoin Cash has come under criticism from the Bitcoin community for its small developer community, calling into question just how decentralized the cryptocurrency actually is. Many also believe that market manipulation may have pushed up the price of Bitcoin Cash over a brief period earlier this month when the price skyrocketed from a low of $650 on a Friday to a high near $2,500 the next day. It has since dropped to about $1,200, while a Bitcoin is worth roughly $8,200.
>
>[Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment. Disclosure: I own Bitcoin.]
>
>Kodric acknowledged the suspicious activity but said it was impossible to prove. Instead, he noted that Bitcoin Cash’s trading volume has been roughly half that of Bitcoin, “so we would prefer to leave it to the market to decide.”
>
>Kodric said that to list a cryptocurrency, the exchange evaluates its technology and the market supply and demand for that coin.
>
>Regarding the politically charged atmosphere around Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, Kodric said that the exchange has not generally been supportive of the big block side, and did not sign the agreement to do the SegWit2x fork. “By listing Bitcoin Cash, we’re not endorsing anything,” he said. “We’re just a marketplace where people can go with their money. We’re not doing any harm to Bitcoin or anything beneficial to Bitcoin Cash.”
>
>He compared the battle between the two sides to the cola wars. “Coca-Cola invented the sweet, dark, bubbly drink, then Pepsi copied everything 90-95% from Coca-Cola, and they marketed the recipe with bigger bottles — actually, similar to Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash at the moment — and they did an aggressive marketing campaign to promote Pepsi, and a bunch of people went to the Pepsi camp and said it was a better drink. Maybe a similar thing is happening here. We’ll have two cryptocurrencies similar in the technology having vocal, strong and sometimes aggressive supporters. We’re in the business of allowing users to to trade whatever they want. We’re not taking any side.”
