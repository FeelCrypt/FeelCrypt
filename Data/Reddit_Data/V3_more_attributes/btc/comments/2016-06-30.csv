Core renege on the 2MB part of the deal. This made them lose face big time. They did ask the community to give the Core devs a few more months then. Core left them holding their pricks in public.

There are multiple implementations of the bitcoin software, Bitcoin Core being the main one used by miners right now allowing only 1mb blocks. There is also Bitcoin Classic (which is coded to fork to allow 2mb blocks), Bitcoin Unlimited and Bitcoin XT which also support bigger blocks. The market in general but more specifically miners need to get consensus over which implementation they want to run to avoid a split of the blockchain and now it seams they have agreed to switch from Core to Classic. If that happens, Core will be incompatible with Classic as soon as Classic starts generating blocks above 1 mb. ;2;1;False;knight222;d4u0ehj;Wow, Chinese Miners Revolt and Announce Terminator Plan to Hard Fork to 2M, Big Fuck to Core (cross-post);http://8btc.com/thread-35645-1-1.html

"its not about capacity increase. i am all yours regarding the 2MB or even more. no issue with that!

what most folks here are not getting are the consequences. 

what happens if the miners are forking? do you expect core to stay silent? of course not. they will immediately change the hash-algorithm, which means we have 2 or maybe even 3 versions of Bitcoin in no time. and dont expect everyone to choose the side of the chinese miners, i see alot of folks in the community who will refuse to go that way.

and now imagine how the media will play all of this mess? and how merchants will react as soon as they learn that now there are different versions of bitcoin and everyone says ""I am Bitcoin!""

seriously, even if you are in favor of 2MB learn to view things rational.

"Just to be clear, I do not think that the network will collapse if blocks are 2MB. The issue is that if miners, and only miners, switch to another implementation their blocks will be invalid in the view of all other nodes, resulting in a chain fork. If miners are stupid enough to stay on this (forked) chain, it will become worthless because no parties of the economic majority accepts their blocks. Additionally, if miners stay on their own chain the chain that the economic majority is on will slow down enormously unless the POW-algorithm is changed.

Having one fork with miners and one with the economic majority will arguably kill Bitcoin, as the security guarantee that miners provide no longer exists. There is also no way that transactions will be processed, unless the POW-algorithm is changed. In such an event, the Bitcoin-price will almost guaranteed tank massively and kill off (not literally) miners, users, exchanges and businesses.

"If I read this correctly, pools and miners representing >75% hash power had a meeting. They decided to designate one pool (not disclosed which, referred to as ""pool xx"") as Terminator. Participating miners except the Terminator will switch to Classic within 30 days. When the Classic hash power exceeds 75%, the Terminator pool will switch as well, immediately bringing total Classic support to >90%, essentially killing off the Core chain and preventing a split chain.

Note that this means outside support is still required. The Terminator pool is part of the >75% represented in the meeting, but won't switch until 75% are reached without the Terminator. That means any pool in the world with >10% hash power can veto the change.

Expansion of the dispute ""Terminator Plan"" proposal 
38 3324 2016-6-30 11:36:38

Posts by water, no soul in 2016-6-30 11:38 edit


Prerequisites:
1, core version 0.13.1 released in July, including the miners activated segwit (isolation witness) are available;
2, classic releases new version is based on core 0.13.1 version, including for miners active segwit (isolation witness) and 2M hard bifurcation;
3, core violation of the Hong Kong expansion consensus agreement, not in August 1, 2016 release includes new versions of 2M hard bifurcation.


Making process:
1, over 75% of the mine pool owners and operators of power miners Optional Optional day expansion of convening the meeting;
2, the meeting reached a consensus: all participants ore miners in pools or expansion route choice will work hand in hand;
3, select a pool of mine as ""Terminator"";
4, released ""Terminator Plan"" content.

Program content:
1. Participating mineral pool, miners reach consensus on expansion: 90% or more operators to activate 2M force bifurcation hard to count more than 95% of the force activation segwit (isolation witness);
2. Participating mineral pool, miners to achieve consensus on the expansion, will be unified planning, unified action, act in unison;
3, select XX meeting mine pool to ""Terminator"";
4, in addition to the ""Terminator"", the participants all mineral pools, within 30 days the miners core program switches to the latest version of the classic, complete 2M hard bifurcation, segwit (isolation witness) Operator support force;
5, if and only if more than 75% of the operator support 2M hard on finalizing the diverging after ""Terminator"" complete support for 2M hard bifurcation as soon as possible to ensure that there are more than 90% of the force operator support 2M hard bifurcation;
6, when the 2M hard fork is activated, the 28-day grace period, the pool of participants ore miners will do everything possible to inform all the miners, exchanges, wallet developer / company, core wallet users, other start-up companies and other completed core switching procedures to ensure the smooth progress of the bifurcation hard, to avoid unnecessary losses generated;
7, activate segwit (isolation witness).






Description proposal:
1. The proposed plan is valid only after three preconditions occur;
2, which is a majority of the miners to mine the main pool of the proposal, there are different opinions may ignore this proposal, will be idle, bored when I was nonsense;
3, expansion of the dispute has been debated for too long, both parties after a long discussion over, except for a few extreme person, most people agree that the following points:
(1) We need to 2M hard bifurcation, but requires enough force to support the operator to ensure that Bitcoin will not be split;
(2) We need to isolate the witness, in order to achieve Bitcoin kernel better scalability and compatibility;
(3) We need lightning network, in order to achieve Bitcoin-second transfer capability.
4. Select the Always use classic classic does not mean that later, if the core in a subsequent compatible version adds support for the classic, the miners can then select the core;
5, core and classic are open source projects, developers fate is freedom, when the miners selected classic, I believe there will be many core developers turn to classic provides code;
6, the battle line expansion, isolation witness, 2M hard bifurcation debate lightning network has been trouble for too long, please do not argue with me here their advantages and disadvantages, and I do not want to waste time on these topics and the energy;
7, one of the core design of bitcoin miner is considered the future direction of the force decided to Bitcoin, ""talk harm the country"", the expansion of the dispute has been debated for too long, continue to argue it is empty. ""Hard work and prosperous,"" better than a perfect plan executed powerful miners was time to act to end this dispute it!
