"Someone asked a question about implementation before LN was done and he answered “Bitcoin Cash”. That was it, he just said two words, not even an explanation as to why it was relevant. Of course he got fucking banned, do you think it would have been A-OK if he had just said “Ripple” instead? At best it was spam, but it definitely wasn’t just “a controversial opinion” that got him banned.

Reminds me of the people who go on T_D, make posts under alts saying horrible things like “I fucking hate n———, I love Trump!”, and then post screen caps to r/politics to make them look bad, ignoring the fact that that horrible shit gets deleted within minutes after being downvotes to oblivion. People believe anything if it’s part of their ridiculous groupthink. 

I see people post here all the time about how even mentioning BCash gets you banned. Maybe you should contribute to actual discussions instead of just screaming “BITCOIN CASH!”in random discussions like an idiot. If I came in here and spammed every conversation with “BUY MONERO!” without contributing anything I would rightfully expect to be banned. Stop poking a lion with a stick then crawling back home to mommy r/BTC with tears on your face when you get clawed."
"No, BCashers are just mad that we rightfully point out that Roger Ver and Craig Wright hold direct or indirect control of almost every mining pool and group that follows Bcash’s node protocols, so they made up some shit about Blockstream controlling Bitcoin. It’s the seizure-like spasms of a dying coin and it’s sheeplike followers.

EDIT: And incidentally, since you seem to be saying that BCash is Bitcoin, BCash is not bitcoin, it’s a cheap scam by Roger Ver and Craig Wright, and you just were unfortunate enough to look up r/BTC instead of r/Bitcoin so now all you see is the shitty quasi-propaganda they post about blockstream.

I, personally, choose to follow a coin that works and whose chief proponent does have massive mental breaks on livestream, while CNN calls him Bitcoin Jesus."
"That image doesn't seem to work.

>than that one time MasterCard invested in a tech company at the forefront of the crypto surge.

The point is that Blockstream has been ruining the project for years and took over the main communities as well, that's why I and many other investors left BTC behind."

Nice framing, I like that! /u/chaintip 
"I know, that's why I'm moving away from PoW algorithms.  It's going to be a massive electricity drain and hardware arms race that will always lead to centralization of miners.  I'm pretty excited about PoC for blockchain tech, PoS will be great for Ethereum tokens but is bad for actual currencies as it discourages spending the damn things.

Byteball is neat for being the first private and truly fungible DAG currency, but good god that name is just awful.  With some branding and better marketing they could go places though."
I’m not new to Bitcoin been since 2010 to me BCH is more what I expected Bitcoin to become. On chain scaling was always the goal. Also my first language isn’t English so maybe that’s why my analogies are weird but of course you expect everyone to speak it perfectly cause everything revolves around America right? Making fun of people’s language skills isn’t going to get you more supporters for BTC. 
">Man, I’m not the person who just claimed that the Bilderbergs are taking over BTC because MasterCard invested in Blockstream.

You claimed Roger Ver and Craig Wright control all the mining pools. Do the Reptilians also control all the mining pools?"
"Well, there’s this: https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*YRMZ23O4J9Y9jcBf.

It seems much more suspicious to me that Roger Ver and Jihan Wu and people like them are the head of a small group of mining pools principally responsible for all BCH traffic, than that one time MasterCard invested in a tech company at the forefront of the crypto surge."
I don't get why people dislike the Byteball name. I like the name, reminds me of tiny tasty meatballs...
"lol, I hope you are trolling and not really that dumb.

https://imgur.com/a/gIOks

Show me any proof that Roger Ver and Craig Wright control almost every mining pool.

>And incidentally, since you seem to be saying that BCash is Bitcoin, BCash is not bitcoin, it’s a cheap scam by Roger Ver and Craig Wright, and you just were unfortunate enough to look up r/BTC instead of r/Bitcoin so now all you see is the shitty quasi-propaganda they post about blockstream.

You're an idiot. I bought Bitcoins in 2013 and joined the community back then. I left rBitcoin in 2015 because they started systematically banning everyone who disagreed with Blockstream."
"Who said my first language is English or that I recide in America? You are making assumptions. You also assume that somehow I must know your mother tongue is not English, but how could I know, not unless you tell me. 

That aside BCH is still very new and has some VERY major flaws in the way it colludes with a certain bunch of Chinese miners and has direct links with the banisters at SBI Bits. Bitcoin never did that, Bitcoin retains its decentralisation and avoids miner centralisation as much as possible. Bitcoin is neutral, doesn't attack other coins, sure scaling didn't go the way everyone wanted but on-chain scaling is not off the books. Side chains makes Bitcoin very useful for a wide range of utility.  I'm not new to Bitcoin either, but everyone seems to claim they are Bitcoin old-timers so I really don't care how long anyone has been 'into' Bitcoin, people say all kinds of BS on the internet. 

Bitcoin is still just as great as the first time I discovered it, I'm very happy with its progress, slow and steady.  I can see right through all the BS from CSW, Ver and his motley crew of ex-cons and sociopaths and I'm very unimpressed by BCH and its crew so far, it's a bloody disgrace if you ask me. But hey thats just my opinion and who cares anyway.. :)"
Man, I’m not the person who just claimed that the Bilderbergs are taking over BTC because MasterCard invested in Blockstream. What’s next, the Reptilians are trying to get leverage over BTC payments because a zoo invested in Square?

"Astroturfing is Roger trying to convince people that BCH is ""the people"" trying to ""take back"" BTC from ""corporations"". I never thought about it that way, thanks."
But.  But. TERRORISTS!
"WORSE than useless...
As Doug Casey (and many others like Walter Block) [say](https://www.caseyresearch.com/doug-casey-on-controversial-buzzwords-part-i/):

*it’s a completely artificial crime. It’s made up. It was created out of whole cloth about 40 years ago, as I recall. Like most “crimes” today, it’s not wrong in itself; it’s wrong because some legislators passed a law [malum prohibitum].*

*There's nothing wrong, in principle, with money laundering.*

*Money laundering is a non-crime, and shouldn't be treated as a crime.*

*Perhaps you got the money illegally or immorally. And, incidentally, those are two totally different concepts, where there's only an accidental overlap. But that’s a big subject for a whole new conversation.*

*But what’s wrong with redeploying capital that already exists in a perfectly legal or moral way? I would say nothing. Money is fungible. It’s not like artwork—it’s not so easy to trace its provenance.*

*It’s counterproductive to make it illegal to take these so-called ill-gotten gains, and do something correct with them. It's just another Kafka-esque crime that they can arbitrarily use to hang you. At what point does capital created illegally become clean?*
____________
*Malum prohibitum* laws are just something that is declared illegal by a small group of ""authority"".
*Malum in Se* is something that is wrong or evil in and of itself like theft, murder etc...
"
"So I work for the world leader in AML compliance software and data and the laws aren't useless they just are incredibly poorly enforced

We have state of the art software that when used correctly can very effectively stop money from going to terrorist, drug traffickers, arms traffickers or foriegn governments 

The problem is many of the banks are super cheap and run out of date software and ignore alerts when they are created

US bank got a 700m fine for money laundering after a decade if having a shitty AML program

In 2 months we have deployed software that fixed all of their issues. But no Banks are willing to make these upgrades without direct fines from regulators and the regulators let so much shit slip by

Our software has already been adapted for use on the blockchain and but exchanges have made no effort to purchase or install it because they don't want to pay to do it right "
"How do you suppose we combat money laundering?  Taxation is an important part of a prosperous society... unless you got a better idea. 

I agree that the current laws are pretty silly though.  Les about combating corruption and crime and more about controlling the poor and allowing the wealthy to keep the status quo.   "
"No. A disgusting person is one that sits around in pajamas all day, hoping to become rich without doing any work.

A good person is one that prints gobs of money out of thin air, thereby robbing tens of millions of people of their life savings. They are the real heroes."
Any chance you have a copy of Walter Block's statement on the issue?
"Taxation is theft. It is the price we pay for failing to build a civilized society.

Money laundering is a made up crime."
You don't. Taxation is wrong and unnecessary.
In my limited searching I could not find Blocks stmt. If I remember right, he talked about it in his book [Defending the Undefendable](https://www.amazon.com/Defending-Undefendable-Walter-Block/dp/1933550171/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1521124760&sr=8-2&keywords=walter+block).
"You clearly take things like roads, to say the least, for granted.  

"
He convinced me crytpocurrencies are a great thing with that one line.
"Wow. Any examples of untaxed functioning societies? I want to live in one where people are happy to pay them, but this sounds even better. Where do I go?

^ Not trying to sound sarcastic. I just read Rational Optimist and think that there's enough to go around, but what distribution mechanism will do? One without humans as middle men is a great start. Then?"
"In Blocks [Legalize Drugs Now publication](http://www.walterblock.com/wp-content/uploads/publications/legalize_drugs_now.pdf), he does say: 

*Are we being hysterical in categorizing present drug law as a form
of servitude? No. our drug laws amount to partial slavery. We must all
question the practices of roadblocks, strip-searches, urine tests, locker
searches, and* **money laundering** *laws. Philosophically speaking, drug
prohibition severely threatens our civil liberties and is inconsistent
with the anti-slavery philosophy and the founding documents of the
United States. The legalization of drugs would give a basic civil liberty
back to U.S. citizens, by granting them control over their own bodies.*"
It's almost as if you believed that it's the government who builds roads.
You clearly have not read Walter Block's [Privatization of Roads and Highways](https://mises.org/library/privatization-roads-and-highways)
"In [Blocks Legalize Drugs Now](http://www.walterblock.com/wp-content/uploads/publications/legalize_drugs_now.pdf) publication, he does say:

*Are we being hysterical in categorizing present drug law as a form of servitude? No. our drug laws amount to partial slavery. We must all question the practices of roadblocks, strip-searches, urine tests, locker searches, and* **money laundering laws.**"
Yep, you right. I didnt find it in his [DU book](https://mises.org/system/tdf/Defending%20the%20Undefendable_2.pdf?file=1&type=document) either. I guess it just seemed like something he would have discussed in that book or said.
"Private companies do but the money they're paid comes from somewhere.

Would you rather a society of all privately owned roads ?  Do you think roads just show up?

This is just one example.  I don't agree with all the ways taxes are spent, but that doesn't change that they're a necessary part of society.  "
I have.  He's an idealist
Ah, thanks for finding it for me.
You think that the only place the government can get money is from taxing the labor of it's citizens? For a good part of this countries existance this was not necessary. You tax things you want to stop people from doing. Eating too many sweets, tax that. Drinking too much alcahol, tax that. Using too much gas, tax that. Working to much and getting ahead, tax that. Makes total sense in a society that makes a profit on welfare. We don't want people making money and getting ahead now do we. 
"I Ctrl+F'ed the PDF available [here](https://mises.org/library/defending-undefendable) but unfortunately did not find anything.

As a side note, I just realized we're on /r/btc, not /r/GoldAndBlack or /r/austrian_economics/ . It seems I'm in a bubble here on reddit."
I'm only a student of this exchange but I'll point out that Bitcoin just showed up, LN (whether it works or not for our purposes) just showed up, Linux just showed up. These are roads.
Caught that too...he def. was about to say ‘control’ and backed off of it.
"FUCK MONEY IN POLITICS!!!!!!

ROOT OF ALL FUCKIN EVIL!!!!"

"This research and presentation is awesome. Great website!

I was interested in donating and checked the page for Bitcoin address. But NO!  They require full name and address. And worse, I'll give it to PayPal.

To me this feels invasive and inconvenient. But then I realized, duh, this entire effort is all about transparency, so it's not going to look good if they accept pseudonymous money themselves. I want to pay them to expose who pays others, without others knowing who pays them for this exposure service.

Is this a hypocritical desire?"
"Got the first part. The ""being busted for money laundering"" makes it sound like you support AML laws, though."
Of...course.
And the market goes down again... 
"Their logo is eerily similar to coinbase's.

I know I suck for saying this, but old people who influence change on new technology need to stop.
Another douchebag democrap
He talks about the money the Fed gives the Treasury in a positive way. That's the worst kind of theft they do! What a disgusting person.
"I think they're talking about actual roads. Physical roads. As it was an example, you would have to consider the fact that capitalism does not provide much incentive for the population to be building public works (roads/highways, water, utilities, public transportation, etc...). If these were privatized, then the costs may instantly go up. If you need to take a road to work, what happens if you had to pay a cost to use it everyday? Then again, government gets corrupted and funds aren't efficiently managed (but that's a whole separate topic). The intentions are clear and what the tax payer's money is used for, but the reality is, it isn't. Where I'm from, I have to pay a ""delivery tax"" for utilities that I used that somehow costs nearly the same amount for electricity that I actually used. Apparently, it was due to the mismanagement of the previous generation where the infrastructure was supposed to have been built to reduce costs and it ended up being a failed project, so my generation has to foot the bill."
Obviously Democrat... Fucking sneks
I asked him on twitter if he would accept crypto campaign contributions. 
How fucking dare he!?  I'M NOT MARRIED.
Thanks, hadn't seen it yet. /u/chaintip
I included that because one of his arguments against crypto was that it's used for laundering. 
A huge portion of ALL politicians take “donations”. Not intrinsic to democrats, or republicans. 
The best part is when he says that it hurts their contr-... ability to have the dollar be the chief means of international finance.

For the irony, I see. Just making sure. AML laws are useless if not worse than useless.
