I cannot prevent you from reading something in a certain way. Just take a real hard look at what is going on and do your own research. If not, you risk being the bagholder. 
You have a source for that?
It’s in Australian dollareedoos 
Sweet as!
his post just reminded me of the SJW acronym 
"> Only fools, noObs and 14 year olds hang on this sub.

Confirmed, sounds like an idiot."
That is probably likely.
I only very recently learned acronyms are only initials that can be said as a word. So sjw is not an acronym. You’re welcome. Cuddles
"Hahah that's absolutely right! I always forget the difference between initials, acronyms, abbreviations...

Much love"
"Bringing up a dead cat bounce for a scam coin has zero relevance to anything here at all. Youre reaching  to make a point. I dont even think you know what a dead cat bounce is, actually. If BTC had a dead cat bounce - i would want to be out of it when the stop loss was reached. The whole point of whaf constitues a dead cat bounce is that dumbasses don't realize the asset is going to die.

And no i have zero fear that bitcoin could hit 1000 on a real exchange with sufficient volume. Bitcoin, not some small cap altcoin like bcash. Again, gemini is a legal trust. If their trading engine fucked up they are actually legally liable. 

You do not seem to realize that what happened here was a 999 limit order, nothing to do with a stop loss. I get it, i called someone a noob, so you want to do a ""no u"" - but you come off silly to anyone that understands the topic."
Lolz maybe when you're in crypto for a few years you'll understand, kid
Another 5-6 years you think would do it?
Some poor bastards are buying bcash for $900 instead of $0.25
On the upside, some lucky bastard just bought a full BTC for $999.
I'd report if you post about Bitcoin here again. Are you losing your mind?

If your limit is greater than the current ask, most matching engines will use the book rate (after all, you're providing a *limit* on what you are willing to pay).
Ahh, okay that makes sense. I feel like the chances of that happening is near 0, but yah..
they might be here.  but just for the LOL's
"and if my grandmother had wheels, she would be a bicycle

"
This was today? Market was nowhere near a high of $10,849..
"what is /j and /w

joking?
w?"
Lol
"OK, your right. So keep all of your BTC on an exchange with a stop loss of $999. Seems safe and smart for a scenario that even according to you probably won't happen. 
Bitconnect bounced from $15 to $70, over 300% bounce
ZCL did over 150%
And if there really was a reason for BTC to crash to 0, do you really think your order would be filled? If BTC goes to 0 guess what, nobody is buying it. Also keep in mind nobody here seems to be on your side, probably because your an idiot."
"thank you for communicating it

in times of regulations ahead an independent marketplace seems to be a legal way

two parties will ever find a value for a token on a mined blockchain via P2P

... just saying xD

Not sure about 2011, but 2013 at least.
"> Please post a reply if you've been into Bitcoin since 2011 and are into BCH

Reply :)"
"> Fuck all you bcashers are noobs

Like you right? You seem to be taking this all very seriously.

"Nope.  It was just an error in the graph.  Nobody bought or sold at that price.

I dunno, I pretty much say what I want and have never had an issue.
