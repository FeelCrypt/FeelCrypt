***SPEDN!
Fact. Keep working to get the hash power behind BCH, then claim the mantle. There's still alot of work to be done.
"> Bitcoin Core is a useful name to identify the legacy chain. If you have a better name for it to remove the ambiguity with the client, then I'm open to it. 

""Bitcoin"" is the best term for the BTC chain as we always called it. There are over 20 UTXo split alts that did exactly what bcc/bch did , none of them are Bitcoin. 

even BCC creator Jihan with Bitmain disagrees and says Bitcoin is Biitcoin and Bitcoin cash is Bitcoin Cash. 



"
"> it takes very little effort to make that happen

We don't talk about current hash rate, we talk about [POW](https://fork.lol/pow/work). If we would switch the hashrate BCH <-> BTC right now, it would take half a year. The longer BTC has a higher hashrate the harder it gets for BCH."
So... politics?
"What about Bitcoin Diamond or Bitcoin Gold or any other fork ? How do you separate this from your argument ? What about forks from Bitcoin Cash down the line ?

I don’t understand why this particular fork of Bitcoin isn’t just trying focus in what it thinks will make it the best coin, rather than spending huge energy bashing other coins. No one attains respect by constantly sabotaging others just so they don’t have to work at being better.  "
"So if I'm running Knots or Libbitcoin, what coin am I using?

And if I was running any Bitcoin node before August 1, 2017, why does it sync to Bitcoin, not Bitcoin Cash?"
"What's to stop someone forking BCH, going back to 1MB blocks, and then claiming it's the real BCH then?

Personally I'm happy with Bitcoin being store of value, because there are already loads of other coins out there which do other things better (LTC & Dash for payments, Decred for Governance, VeChain for 3rd party transactions, ETH/ETC/Neo etc for smart contracts etc etc)

Having 1 coin to rule them all is not decentralization."
"Hashrate follows market price, and market prices can be horribly deranged by clueless newbs in the short term. Erik's statement is equivalent to saying Bitcoin is whatever branch temporarily has the highest price *for any reason.* 

It's a completely untenable position, because every phase of exponential growth leaves the old investors as a tiny minority. It should have been obvious that as Bitcoin became more mainstream there would be times that newbs could be misled into supporting errant branches and thereby errant branches would at times accumulate greater total hashpower.

Nothing in Satoshi's writings covers how to deal with a situation where there are competing adamant factions, and the community at large simply assumed there would never be a reason to split where both branches of an experiment could have major support. "
"Yes, but it would need to rewrite history. You'd need to convince the majority of full nodes to accept you version of events, even though they already have a history of events and they're only really open to changing the last few blocks.

I certainly think it's possible that if Bitcoin Cash becomes overwhelmingly dominant and the Bitcoin chain fades into obscurity, that we could just resort to just calling it Bitcoin without issues because it would be the expectation of newcomers that when they want to buy ""Bitcoin"", they would mean the majority.

At present, when people (other than a few diehards) say ""Bitcoin"", they do not mean Bitcoin Cash.

The lesson is, if you want to fork Bitcoin with new rules and get a majority, you need to majority before forking in order for people to generally accept you as the main chain and therefore be called ""Bitcoin"". Trying to retroactively call yourself Bitcoin, when the Bitcoin chain is still running at higher hashrate than you is exactly what the consensus mechanism of Bitcoin was designed to prevent."
And arguably businesses which use Bitpay or Coinbase aren't really using Bitcoin (especially if none of their remittances are received in Bitcoin).
"""Every merchant having a copy of the blockchain"" means it needs to be affordable for a self-employed person to have a copy running on his PC in his home office.

If your single-person business needs to build a dedicated server with a large RAID, then you've failed to make it ""every business"". This isn't an inclusive financial system, it's exclusive only to businesses large enough to have someone do that for them, which is a terribly small fraction of businesses. It's also a non-start for someone wishing to start  a business without much initial capital.

In other words. It sounds pretty much like the fucking system we already have."
I don't consider it a bug, but I do agree that bitcoin cash had to do it to survive. These are evolving systems in hostile environments. Both chains are very different from the original bitcoin implementation, and that is as we would expect.
"I agree. I was trying to point out that clinging to the white paper and ""satoshi's vision"" as a source of truth in the context of an open source software project is a stupid meme."
I could not agree with you more. I'm sorry I can only give you 1 upvote. I actually like the coin itself (I like both) just as a like litecoin, eth etc. etc. but it's the toxic community that is soooo negative about anything... everything else that it's such a turnoff. Now that BCH is nearing parity with LTC as an example, all the bch people are attacking LTC like LTC is the problem with the world. It's crazy. LTC has been around longer, has better real world adoption  and serves a similar function so it must be attacked instead of embraced for being years ahead of bch and helping to grow crypto and be a potential real product market.  Heaven forbid I say this message. Here come the downvotes. It's so immature and petty.  
"And the chain evolved to support segwit, even though that was not part of the whitepaper. I feel like there is major cognitive dissonance in this subreddit when it comes to ""SATOSHI'S TRUE VISION!"""
"I don't think bitcoin cash is any more peer-to-peer than bitcoin. They both function almost exactly the same.

The only real difference is bitcoin also has potential second layers running on top, while bitcoin cash is increasing the block size directly. Which by the way increases the cost of running  a node and increases mining centralization due to latency. The result being a chain that is increasingly less peer-to-peer as the block size increases.

Trying to on-board an exponential number of new users with a linear scaling solution really doesn't make any technical sense unless you are ok with centralization pressure this puts on the chain. If you are ok with that, then that is cool, but you can't also claim to be more p2p when the opposite is what will occur."
What do you mean, I don't understand.
"Yeah because: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217

Another example maybe?"
"Why is he full of shit? We got a fork of Bitcoin, but it didn't get more accumulated work than the existing chain, so it's not Bitcoin.

You can believe this and still be a staunch supporter of BCH."
"He did exactly this.  He supported 2x.  Strongly.  He went to bat for it.  He was attacked mercilessly for it.

BCH forked off too early.  BCH forked off without the economy, without the users, and without the businesses.  It had to build them all for scratch and, because 2x/BCH divided the people that wanted real scaling, Core got to keep them all for free.

That was a colossally stupid move.  Because of that, BTC has kept by far the largest amount of the hashpower, to the point where BCH will not be able to catch up in the next 6 months even if the cashening happens.

That means Core kept the BTC ticker, and the Bitcoin name.  It is Bitcoin. Cash is the fork.  That's all there is to it.  Eric acknowledges this.  It's time for the ""BCH is Bitcoin"" crew to recognize reality and accept what they cannot change."

I emailed the site’s support staff about the issue as well and received a “technical vs. political” reply which was largely BS.

So, Roger, your plan has backfired against me, a moderate on this issue. If that makes me a “Core Troll”, then whatever. I’ll continue to upvote and downvote as I see fit. Long live crypto, but down with the infighting. Please."

Because I don't see how in the context of the tweet you made disavowing BCH, you can be said to not be going back on your intent to support a hard fork away from core's leadership, unless you honestly think we'd be better off with three significant forks of Bitcoin?

"
"There's more than a hint of moral cowardice here. Early on, if influential and ethical people in the Bitcoin community prominently condemned unethical acts starting with when /u/theymos [launched massive censorship and unwarranted user banning in August 2015](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3h9cq4/its_time_for_a_break_about_the_recent_mess/), there's a good chance we'd not be in near the mess we find ourselves in now. I must've missed it when you came out vocally and prominently against such underhanded action at that time, or since. Perhaps you could link me to some examples?  

More recently, I haven't heard you expressing any qualms about how activated SegWit on the BTC chain only got added illegitimately, since the ""2x"" portion of the consensus agreement has never come to pass. ""2x"" is the aspect of the consensus agreement that raised support for SegWit1x from the 30%-35% that it had languished in for months (never once exceeding 40% support), to the overwhelming 90%+ support SegWit2x had at lock in time. This shows the crucial aspect for earning most of the miner support was the ""2x"" component, not SegWit alone. You present yourself as a strong believer of what's expressed in the white paper. Why wouldn't you denounce this clear subversion of Nakamoto Consensus?  

e: grammar"
Is this what you call not backing out? https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-segwit2x/2017-November/000685.html
Where were you when the 2x predictably lost Core support after they got their precious SegWit?
"I wanted to jump in to say that Roger and Bitcoin.com also supported the Segwit2x hard fork ABOVE the BCH fork up to the point that the 2x portion was terminated.

I recall a myriad of tweets and comments flying at Roger regarding BCH after it forked, but Roger didn't budge on his position to uphold Segwit2x. I wasn't in the room at ConsensusNY when the agreement was signed, but if ordering of signatures is an insight into anything, Bitcoin.com was one of the first companies that did so, and it seemed that Roger was not going to back down on this promise. Hell, their company stepped up and offered to provide engineering support for the devs coding the fork alongside Bitmain and Bitfury: https://medium.com/@DCGco/bitcoin-scaling-agreement-at-consensus-2017-133521fe9a77

This was corroborated further when Roger himself issued an update regarding all of the noise he was receiving during this period. (I recall it was issued as a PSA on their site, and I've been unable to find it via a light googling, but once I find it, I will be editing this post with a link to it). In this update, Roger stated that he was honoring his agreement with everyone, and regardless of what BCH was at that time, Bitcoin.com's full support was given to Segwit2x. This was after Segwit was activated, but before the 2x fork was due to activate. Roger closed the statement by highlighting his intention to see the agreement through UNLESS the 2x portion failed to activate. If this were to become the case, all of their company resources were going to transition and focus on BCH.

After the 2x activation was terminated, Roger held true to his word and began working on BCH. This company transition was announced via another PSA: https://www.bitcoin.com/public-service-announcement

You supported a potential hard fork, that's very true. You indicated this intention by signing the agreement alongside your peers, big blockers and small blockers alike. However, you were not given a hard fork. You were given one more instance of what the entire BTC community had been given for years: a broken promise."
"Oh, don't worry. Our words are important, but our actions are defining.

It is important to stand against misinformation and against trolls, but action might get bitcoin (bch) great.

You should have seen they reaction (and mine) when one of my friends received bitcoin instantly for peanuts and said something like :""so I can send bitcoin without paying £5 fee?"" 

Why in hell not?

"What you're saying doesn't make any sense. And it has been debunked countless times.

Non miners nodes don't help the network at all. They are in fact completely irrelevant. Bitcoin doesn't work as a mesh network. Miners form a near complete graph.

"> That is why full nodes are so important, consensus must come from the entire community,

You know that the same people that mine ""centralized BCH"" also mine ""decentralized BTC"" right?  It's the exact same miners.

These are the people your nonmining node ""protect"" you from, right?

So one day, when a consensus of hashpower starts mining bigger blocks, your client will reject these blocks.  If anyone is still mining the smaller-block chain, it will be insecure and subject to constant reorgs or attacks.  That will be the chain you will be following.  It will eventually stall or require replay protection.

Now tell me, do you:

A. congratulate yourself for having foiled the evil miners by refusing to follow their invalid chain, or

B. scramble to upgrade your client because the coins on the chain you're following are unspendable

"You're giving Luke too much credit here. Do you think if Bitcoin Cash had been a majority hard-fork that he would change his mind and agree that the chain with 1MB blocks isn't ""true Bitcoin."" He would be harping more loudly than anyone that the chain is invalid because his Bitcoin Core client rejects it and therefore the BTC minority fork is the true chain. "
Run a 2010 node.  It won't sync any chain.   Therefore Bitcoin no longer exists.
"Please note that I am advancing this argument simply because it was the argument foisted against large-blockers from 2015-2017 and the argument used to justify the ""UASF"" and ""NO2X"" movements.

Small blockers have told us for years (particularly when it seemed like Bitcoin Unlimited was about to get a majority of hashpower) that *total hashpower wasn't enough -- it had to be valid hashpower to matter.* . That is why every user was encouraged to run a ""full node"" - so he could ensure that blocks were valid according to *his* definition of validity.  See [this](https://medium.com/@lopp/securing-your-financial-sovereignty-3af6fe834603) for an example of the dogma.

Well, according to that dogma, then I, and others like me, determine what makes Bitcoin ""valid"" by choosing what consensus rules to follow.

Fine.  By that definition, BCH is Bitcoin.  QED."

"This is not *my* philosophy, my friend.  I'm merely repeating Luke's philosophy back to him.

Well neat.  That means that I get to say ""BCH is valid Bitcoin"" because those are the rules I enforce.

They don't like that, so since they have a hashpower majority, they want to fall back on hashpower majority as the final determinant of validity.  OK great.  I agree!  Now remind us all again what that ""validation"" node is protecting you from?  It sounds like it's protecting you from accidentally following *the real Bitcoin.*

"A) Coins are still being minted and given away with each new block.  The fees are minor in comparison.

B) Yes I did mine.

C) The difficulty retargets in the next 24 hours or so, and will make BCH more profitable to mine than BTC.  So... there's your incentive.  "
"Rising is not enough. Prices would have to be higher than BTC prices. 

That's ignoring BCH's lower difficulty for now, but if miners switched en masse, difficulty would equalize or even surpass BTC's. You don't get any fees worth mentioning on BCH, and the number of coins per block reward is the same. So the only way this makes sense is when BCH is more expensive than BTC. Might happen one day, but we are a looong way from there."

"> Because 'Bitcoin Core' is an implementation and not a protocol.

This is false. Bitcoin Core is the protocol-defining implementation, as you'll find out when you visit bitcoin.org and look for the [protocol specification](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Protocol_documentation)."
"Saying ""Bitcoin Core"" is a useful and minimally offensive way to distinguish BTC now, from the chain that existed before SegWit activated and from BCH. In particular, it works because Core is the dominant software repository for that fork branch, and the only group allowed to make **any** consensus changes whatsoever. Calling either branch of the fork ""Bitcoin"" right now is simply less accurate. All other alternatives would likely be more offensive to those who choose to frequent /r/Bitcoin. I think Bitcoin (SegWit) is fine, or Blockstream Bitcoin. Bitcoin (store-of-value) would work as well. Or we could play /r/Bitcoin's game and devolve into calling it BCore or B-Fees at every possible opportunity and in every venue, and using an army of trolls and sock puppets.  

EDIT: You can't identify the BCH block chain by saying ""Bitcoin ABC"" because there are many compatible implementations that run the BCH block chain, any one of which can achieve hash rate supremacy at any time. A reader wouldn't know you meant BCH, and not the ABC implementation. Saying ""Bitcoin Core"" doesn't have this problem because it's the monopoly repository, and the **only** one allowed to make any consensus changes. It's highly specifying, leaving little room for confusion."
Redditor /u/noisylettuce has low karma in this subreddit.
"> Besides, what you're arguing is purely hypothetical. BCH has to gain 10x it's current hashrate just to match Bitcoin, and that only if Bitcoin's hashrate stagnates. The chances of that, given the community bias towards Bitcoin as being the real bitcoin, and BCH being a fork, are negligible.

Be careful that you don't view the Bitcoin subreddit (or /r/btc for that matter) as representative of the community.  You need to look wider, and consider the number of exchanges, wallets and merchants who are using something.  The odds of Bitcoin Gold exceeding the BTC hashrate are negligible -- you need to look hard to find anyone using it.  BCH on the other hand is supported by many exchanges, many wallets, and has support from BitPay and others.  I won't say it's a sure thing that it's hash rate will surpass BTC, but the odds are far from ""negligble""."
"A purely on-chain solution is one where every note and coin effectively has a unique ID, and these IDs are recorded in every transaction.

But I agree with you that a cryptocurrency must meet those properties, I think we just disagree on how to achieve it.

Personally, I'd hope for something more like monero, where everything is confidential, however, Monero has bigger scaling issues than Bitcoin, because confidential transactions are currently much larger than a regular P2PKH transaction."
If it gains and sustains more hashrate, it will eventually have more total PoW right?
It’s logical in that sense that when you are using the network, you got to support it also by running a full node (and thus having a full copy of the blockchain)
"No, but we do have access to his public posts and comments, most of which Bitcoin Cash are directly or very closely aligned with. As for the ""every business should have its own copy of the blockchain"" thing, by that I assume he must have meant merchants or intermediaries, since those actually need to be able to verify transactions themselves to avoid fraud. If you use Bitpay or Coinbase Commerce for your POS, then you leave that responsibility to them"

> Satoshi also said a lot of dumb bullshit like that every business should have its own copy of the entire blockchain, which nobody would ever consider a good idea today.

""Having its own copy of the blockchain"" means ""running a full node"" which the Core camp still claim *everybody* should do, not just businesses.

"> It wasn't just the block size increase, but also the EDA algorithm

True. One of the reasons why Segwit2x crowd took so much time to start working on BCH

> Would you say that the EDA was Satoshi's vision as well?

Good question. From my point of view it was like a bug in Bitcoin code, like when billions of coins were created. If EDA would persisted, BCH chain could spiral down for economical reason and from the loss of trust in the system itself, but new DAA is stronger than Satoshi's version: any chain with new DAA is more resilient than BTC to hashrate loss and don't vary from BTC's when hashrate is there. ~95k coins to miners ahead of schedule is another trade-off on the Bitcoin list"

Bitcoin Core isn't Bitcoin, Bitcoin Gold, and all the other segwitcoins are not Bitcoin. I don't get triggered by the fact that an altcoin like Core tries to claim the name, and neither should you. Free market decides, and so far all the major merchants and developers have sided with us."

This is really simple if you just go with POW. No politics pure maths. Obviously a crippled coin cant hold POW forever. 
Your hypothetical is ridiculous. Users wouldn’t/couldn’t use a currency with almost zero transaction capacity, so it would lose all value. Miners wouldn’t continue mining a chain with no value. So the market would migrate to a more sensible fork and that would become Bitcoin. **This has not yet happened with BCH**. Pretending that it has in the hopes that you can “fake it ‘til you make it” is just deceptive marketing bullshit.
The soft fork happened because miners were afraid to mine a valueless coin and thats why they used the centralized NYC agreement as excuse to follow the money what they always do
"That is why full nodes are so important, consensus must come from the entire community, not only the miners. Users decided with their nodes that Bitcoin + Segwit is more valuable than Bcash. Miners that were signaling for BU knew that they would lose money by mining the less valuable coin so they shifted to Segwit, that is the magic of multiple layers of decentralization, and not only the miners that decide. The coin is there for the users right? Miners only deliver a service, so it makes a lot of sense that users have the final say, and we learned that in this event. If you don't like it stay on Bcash, but don't call it Bitcoin because it simply isn't. I know that a Bcash full node will be soon too expensive to run for the common user, so Bcash doesn't enjoy multiple layers of decentralization. That's why it is a centralized altcoin.

What looks more like a scam? Using a BTC Reddit to promote BCH (doesn't make any sense) or calling Bitcoin Cash (what is clearly technically NO Bitcoin) Bcash?"

There's nothing wrong with BCH accepting the mantle that it is a minority fork and it must work to overcome the failures that lead to the fork in the first place so it can become the dominant coin.  But that won't make it Bitcoin - words don't just change definitions from year to year willy nilly, and the definition is pretty set in stone by now.

"That's the big lie. It only syncs to the same chain *if you give up capability you previously enjoyed*. Specifically, if your pre-SegWit client ever saw an Anyone-Can-Spend transaction, you're free to spend it to yourself. Now, once SegWit activates, and you see a SegWit Anyone-Can-Spend transaction, you can again spend that and send it to yourself. But what's the result? You'd find yourself forked off of the SegWit chain. But you never made any changes to your client. So the fact that you get hard forked is because of the changes SegWit made. This is one of the obvious ways to see it's really a disguised hard fork, and **NOT** a soft fork as repeatedly claimed.

"By every other criteria, I mean everything else expressed in the [Bitcoin white paper](http://nakamotoinstitute.org/bitcoin), beginning with the title itself. BCH is clearly ""A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System"", whereas BTC is actively making itself into a high fee, high friction, low utility store-of-value-only system. Key Core developer Greg Maxwell prominently toasted ""champaign"" to celebrate as transaction fees crested $50 just six months or so ago.  

The only criteria BCH does not yet have over BTC for claiming the ""Bitcoin"" name is total cumulative proof of work. And you're right, that's an important one. But I should also point out that you have to be a ""valid"" entity based on the rules of the white paper. Today's BTC has only gotten to where it is by pointedly and repeatedly subverting the white paper's prescribed Sybil-resistant Nakamoto consensus mechanism. This is no more obvious than in the fact that SegWit was illegitimately added to the BTC block chain. ""Illegitmately?"" you say? Yes, because the ""2x"" part of the SegWit2x consensus agreement was never added, so SegWit was essentially pushed on to the block chain in an end-run around Nakamoto Consensus. The ""2x"" aspect of the consensus agreement was the only thing that pushed miner support for SegWit from the 30%-35% range it was languishing in (never exceeding 40% at any point), to the overwhelming support SegWit2x had at lock-in time.  

So by that measure BTC with activated SegWit is not a valid claimant for the ""Bitcoin"" name either.

And people are free to run their own solution if they want, but merchants need hard cash to pay their rent and employees. If Bitcoin Cash reaches total world domination and you can pay government taxes, your employees and your rent with it, then I see no reason to use intermediaries, but until that point, merchants are going to use third party companies to, if not handle their money (coinbase commerce gives you full ownership over your funds), at least run a node for you, and let you use their super user-friendly POS.

It's possible - some might say, likely - that Bitcoin Cash can significantly overtake BTC in hashpower.  Even for a while.

Bad bot
What if you are using a bitcoin core client from before segwit existed? It still synchs with the same chain.
Point taken. I'm not one who argues that highest accumulated proof of work matters though so I shouldn't have gotten involved. To me all that matters is the current hashing difficulty and thus the current security of a chain if one wishes to perform a transaction.
What do you mean by Core-chain consensus rules? There's were no changes to the consensus rules. SegWit is fully backwards compatible.  Knots and Libbitcoin and bcoin are legitimate Bitcoin implementations.
"I question if you know what a ***crypto*** fork is for the reason I stated.  Forks are intended by very definition to use the original name, and winner of the name is defined by hashpower and longest valid chain.  Whoever holds those traits gets the original name.  

Bitcoin is not ""core"", and they do not own it.  Bitcoin is not software.  It is a concept.  And in a truly decentralized system, development is also decentralized across multiple implementations.  

Claiming that a fork intended to redirect Bitcoin back to its originally intended purpose is 'misleading' or 'tricking' people conveys a complete lack of understanding of how all of this works. This is not the same as forks you may be familiar with. 

You already know why they chose Bitcoin Cash.  There needed to be a temporary name during the ramping up/transition period.  I too wondered how this would play out because humans tend to become familiar with a name.  So I guess if Bitcoin Cash wins hashpower and valid chain competition, Bitcoin will be called Bitcoin Cash in the future.  

Its likely that psychologically, people will view Bitcoin (BTC) as the slow, expensive Blockstream settlement layer coin that is now owned by Blockstream, and making them billions of dollars.  And Bitcoin Cash (BCH) will be the original Bitcoin on a philosophical and functional level.  The two will probably coexist indefinitely.   Much to your (and others) dismay.  Cuz this is a lot bigger than ""Roger""."
"Great points, a few minutes' digging through the history reveals most of the Core supporters to be incorrigible goalpost movers. However, I don't really think Satoshi said anything to indicate he had considered the case where there are two *adamant* and persistent factions, and to me it's pretty obvious that the hashrate, as it follows what can be a very whimsical market price in the short run, is not a reliable way to determine the winner out of two *persistent factions* except in the long run.

When people speak of nonsense like big-block attacks, I always say Bitcoin is a block-by-block hashpower vote where such noise can be easily thwarted block by block, but if stalwart factions form and persist, the chains split off and then we are in a longer term situation."
"See here’s the thing about Roger. His intentions are good. Which is why I call into question any claims that he’s intentionally misleading or lying to people out of some sinister motive. I know that to be completely false.

I have a very huge discomfort with a corporation coming in and delaying on chain scaling to force people off chain. That’s really what this is all about for me. It’s a conflict of interest that doesn’t belong in bitcoin, in any capacity. 

They absolutely could have raised the limit a little bit to keep BTC usable. But they created a crisis to benefit their own profit goals. And that’s just abhorrent to me. 

And the fact that you and I could not even have this conversation in the bitcoin sub because the corrupt moderators would remove me before I had a chance to even explain my thoughts.

So, yes, while I understand Roger's motivations and can see the passion from so many people about BCH, I still strongly believe that bitcoin.com is actively scamming users.

"Right, I was being very conservative with those figures. Ideally we don't just want a ""replacement for cash"", but we want to make microtransactions a viable concept.

For instance, the current web functions largely by publishers coercing users browsers to push their personal preferences to advertisers, and the advertisers compensate the publish for this. It's unethical, and neither the consumer nor publisher actually like the approach, but it's seen as really the only way to monetize publishing.

Much more ethical approaches to publishing/subscribing could be made with microtransactions done by the browser, with a consumer's consent. User's will no longer have their privacy invaded by third-parties who add nothing of value between the publisher and subscriber.

In this kind of system, a typical user would be making hundreds of transactions per day just browsing the web. They could also be the recipient of transactions with opt-in advertising models or for publishing content.

It's not really any wonder that the advertising giants are afraid of cryptocurrency, because their core business model of selling data to advertisers is about to be disrupted."

Wrong. The longer time goes on the more BCH gains. 
it's also important to note that the difference in accumulated work on the 2 chains is not merely diverging linearly, but in fact continuously accelerating in btc's favor. 
If BCH gains majority hashpower it has both the longer chain and the greatest proof of work.

It's simply how the Sybil-resistant mechanism in the system decides what ""valid"" is.

What does this have to do with anything? Having the most cumulative proof of work defining what Bitcoin is has nothing to do with whether it will be ""1 coin to rule them all"". Even if Bitcoin does become that, the system is not centralized just because it's a dominant coin.

That's why I think that except for the current (hopefully temporary) situation where BCH does not yet have most cumulative proof of work, it's still the crypto that most closely satisfies every other criteria in Satoshi's white paper."
"History would never need to be rewritten, because the histories already started to diverge when the hard fork occurred on August 1, 2017. The only thing that would happen is the BTC chain would now be the minority chain that by every single criteria would no longer be able to claim the name ""Bitcoin"". BCH, which already can claim every criteria for the ""Bitcoin"" name over BTC *except* total cumulative proof of work, would then be ""Bitcoin"" without any doubt at all.  

The histories of both separate chains would stay entirely the same."
for a new poster, you seem to just get it, in a way that many do not. if bch becomes the majority coin, then the minority hashrate btc will die off b/c it will lose all its network effects. this is precisely a long distance reorganization attack, with year(s) worth of bitcoin transaction histories getting wiped out. think of the ramifications, crypto could not possibly be a viable payment system if such long distance rewrites were even remotely possible. the only reason bch has survived this long so far, is b/c btc has been intentionally crippled with 1 mb blocks. 
"> You'd need to convince the majority of full nodes

Non-mining nodes are irrelevant. Vulnerable to Sybil attack"
"> Yes, but it would need to rewrite history. You'd need to convince the majority of full nodes to accept you version of events, even though they already have a history of events and they're only really open to changing the last few blocks.

Thats not actually how it works: full nodes follow the longest chain that meets its consensus rules, even if that means changing many months or even years of blocks.

BTC nodes would not accept a longer BCH chain because the BCH chain isn't valid under BTC consensus rules, which limits blocks to 1MB."
Actually Coinbase Commerce allows you to retain full access to your private keys (and as a result, doesn't support instant fiat conversion), and requires you to enter your password to decrypt it when moving funds, etc. You only stop using Bitcoin after you've moved your funds to Coinbase's consumer site to sell it for monopoly money
"Satoshi was famously pro big datacenters being the only ones running nodes, so it's very unlikely that's what he meant. A in-person store will likely use Bitpay or whatever else is already integrated into their POS software, and won't have to worry about it in the first place.


If a online merchant, such as myself wants to integrate cryptocurrency into their checkout, they're free to reinvent the wheel with a 10TB expandable HDD on a $40/m storage server and be good for a few decades, or they can simply integrate commerce, bitpay or one of the other 100+ solutions made specifically for them.

There's a reason stores don't have their own bank license to receive and verify payments."
"But its like these people are saying it *didn't* and *can't* gain majority.   
When in truth, **it is still possible and could** be that it gains more hashrate.

Why would you need a large RAID for a 200 gb blockchain?   Or a terabyte blockchain for that matter (just for arguments sake)?

"Sorry but you are confusing decentralization with p2p. If Jihan was the only miner and never censored txs is bitcoin still p2p? Yes. And if Jihan decided to censor by leaving txs dangling in the mempool he would incentivize new entrants into the market because anyone with the resources can mine. 

Because I can't put it any better than this guy: 

""The block size is basically orthogonal to the proof-of-work, and the proof-of-work is distributed in the sense that anyone can do it. There is nothing stopping any entity from doing the proof-of-work if they have the resources and capabilities. So this idea that there will be one company that is the only one doing Bitcoin doesn't really make sense if it's cost competitive for other companies to be involved. Yet the boogeyman of centralization is repeated in censored forums. It misunderstands the bitcoin’s central economic conceit: it’s the greed of the miners that makes bitcoin work.

""End users can still validate transactions via SPV, which is completely valid and provable without storing the entire block chain. Consensus relay nodes can do the same thing, although they will start dropping off the network when the bandwidth costs become prohibitive. So in a small block system we have an extremely limited amount of space for transactions, which means the cost will eventually be excessively high and result in settlement between big players. That's the choke point that allows for KYC and AML. You can submit a transaction to the network, but you can't afford to because there isn't enough bandwidth to service your request so you are forced into regulated channels, onto exchanges, or through third party choke points that can be audited. 

""People who want small blocks for Bitcoin really need to be thinking about using an altcoin, it was never in the plans to have an extremely low bandwidth pipe to keep things decentralized when the proof-of-work is by default a centralizing force."" *

Centralized  BUT still p2p. To the contrary LN is NOT p2p. It bottlenecked into hubs from the moment it was born and that will only get worse.

The first several versions of BTC nodes did not have a block size limit.
That sounds good and I'd agree that counts.
"Satoshi wanted everyone to be running a full node.

You don't need a big hard drive to run a full node. Just put prune=550 in the bitcoin.conf file. Your Bitcoin full node will never take up more than about 4 gigabytes of hard disk space.

"Yes, when you project how big it is going to be over 5-10 years (whatever would be the expected lifetime of your PC).

Bitcoin will fit on a 2TB drive over 10 years. This isn't yet any need for concern.

The issue is that there is no long-term scaling plan in place on Bitcoin Cash. You can't just ""keep increasing the block size"", because it won't be affordable to run a node.

For reference, I'm not completely against increasing the block size by small amounts (I agree 1MB/4MB is too small), but I don't see Bitcoin Cash as having a feasible roadmap, and it's also full of scam-like/fraudulent behavior that I'd rather not be associated with."
From 1MB sure, but indefinitely, no. My point was that bitcoin cash does not appear to have a scaling solution at all beyond increasing the block size indefinitely.

"> When it failed to materialize, he should have immediately gotten behind BCH.

This is the folly of BCH forking 3 months BEFORE segwit2x failed.  BCH became a joke amongst the moderates and the Core supporters; Because it barely had any momentum - far less than it has today - it wasn't taken seriously by any businesses and most miners.  Coinbase, run by longtime bigblockers, said they wouldn't support it at all or allow it for trade.  Even Jihan said he wouldn't mine it until after others started.  Jihan also states that it is not Bitcoin.

When you fork too early while many of your potential supporters are still supporting a different alternative, you create problems.  BCHers were warned of this and ignored it.  They have their reasons for doing that, which I don't agree with, but the reality remains the same, and that's how we got here today.

> Can you define this term for me? I have opinions about it but I'm curious what you think.

A mainnet proven ability to keep fees at a low amount under high transaction loads and while still processing transaction confirmations in a timely fashion.

Core had the chance to do this and utterly failed in December, along with multiple failures before December.  I believe BCH's bigger blocks will perform fine, but it hasn't been real-world tested other than with Ethereum - Which is quite a bit different due to its faster blocktimes.  Ethereum choked a bit but did clear through and recover much smoother than Core.  That was also Ethereum's first real test whereas it was Core's 5th or 7th or so.  I eagerly await the real world test of BCH's capacity.

> Why do you think this?

[This graph.  To overcome BTC's total work lead](https://imgur.com/3HOu86t), BCH's line must cross the BTC line that it is way, way behind.  This is driven by miner payouts, which is driven by price whenever reward amounts are equal.  BTC's price has been ~6-10x higher for ~9 months now.  To simply catch up, BCH's price would need to be 10x higher for about 7-10 months.  But at this point, simply reaching price parity with BTC would be huge news, nevermind being 10x higher."
Nope.
"Your continued gaslighting that we are ""tricking"" anyone does not fly considering almost every facet of the white paper and it's designed mechanism for evolution backs BCH as ""Bitcoin"" over present-day BTC.  

As a developer, you should realize if you can't operate within the bounds of a white paper, you have no business claiming what you are doing is part of that project. For Bitcoin, it actually goes further, since Nakamoto Consensus allows any manner of legitimate evolution and deviation from the original design laid out by Satoshi through a truly Sybil-resistant consensus evaluating mechanism. However, it's clear that present-day BTC was only able to get to where it is now via Core and collaborating censors cheating and subverting this mechanism: even stronger proof that today's BTC rejects everything the white paper defined as ""Bitcoin"". Not true, you say? OK, then tell me where the ""2x"" part of the SegWit2x consensus agreement is for the BTC block chain? Without it, SegWit inclusion is illegitimate and was backdoored in to subvert the Sybil-resistant aspect of Nakamoto Consensus (the 2x aspect of the consensus agreement was the only thing that was able to garner overwhelming miner support for SegWit inclusion).

"If you actually understood what a fork is, you would understand what Roger is doing.  I will say what I said to someone else 10 minutes ago:

-----

*Think of a scenario where Bitcoin actually did end up hijacked by developers who were doing something that thoroughly offended you.  Maybe selling Bitcoin to the highest bidder in corrupt governments.  Pick a scenario.  Get offended by it.  Get enraged by it.*

*Now how would you, and thousands of others deal with that.  Well ... you would use the feature called forking.  And your purpose in forking would be obvious.  To reclaim Bitcoin from corrupt developers who have been bought off by corporations and governments right?*

*In this scenario you *care* about ***Bitcoin***.  *You believed in bitcoin for 8 years, and you put your life behind it, and hoped for the change it would bring.  And Bitcoin's name is famous now. And has power to change, but those in power ended up killing it.*

*So you fork.  Right?*

*Now ... would you name the fork Bitcoin, or something else that has no recognition, and no ties to your actual project? Would you let corrupt people steal the name from its original goal?  No.  You would fork, and as with forks, you'd call it fucking Bitcoin.*

***Given ALL of this context, would you really have a problem if someone (LUCKILY!) owned the official dot com for Bitcoin and put your fork front and center as part of trying to reclaim Bitcoin away from corruption?***

-----

No.  You wouldn't.  And if you claim otherwise, you are being dishonest.   What Roger is doing is perfectly rational, given the context.  Taking the name is perfection rational, given what is going on.  And straight-up REMOVING it from bitcoin.com is also perfectly rational, if he chose to do it.   

Why?  Because of what I just explained above.  Think about it.  Its not deception.  Its not misleading.  Its a very deadly serious ideology difference and this is a free market open source situation where a Corporation has strangled on-chain scaling for their own profit goals.

I know.. if the slow bleed continues that'll happen.
Denying this is denying the central tenet of Bitcoin. If you don't believe in most cumulative proof of work defining what is valid Bitcoin, than why'd you ever get involved with it to begin with, and why do you still try to usurp the name for your store-of-value-only token?

Bitcoin Core coins are not not a chain of digital signatures, therefore they are not Bitcoin, according to the white paper. 
Agreed. Bitcoin.com calling Bitcoin Cash “Bitcoin” was needlessly antagonistic. We really don’t need the drama. When the longest chain switches to Bitcoin Cash, then change the name- but until then, they should stick with the name that everybody knows and work on building the brand up.
"BCH and BTC both have legitimate claims to the name Bitcoin. Why not call them Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Core then? Why does Bitcoin Core get to steal the name ""Bitcoin"" to describe something that is not at all similar to the system described in the whitepaper and that I and many others originally put our efforts behind?"
It also opens the fact that if someday BCH has more hash-rate than BTC, he has to accept BCH is BITCOIN
"How is Bitcoin oldschool? They overcomplicated a easy solution, and forked themselves off to the point where the 70% of the whitepaper isn't even valid for them. We follow the rules in the whitepaper definition of Bitcoin, and are fulfilling Satoshi's wishes for Bitcoin as a digital borderless currency.

The fact that we're a minority fork doesn't really matter anyways, considering we HAD to fork when we did, and people thought Segwit/LN was going to solve the issue. If most of the #NO2X #UASF crowd could go back in time I bet the majority of them would have supported BCH, and we wouldn't have to add replay protection and make ourself a separate coin in the first place."
"This. Bitcoin Cash is a totally fine name IMO as it contains the main keywords of the whitepaper's title.

Roger has done an excellent job especially when it comes to fighting the censorship, but with these silly naming games and unnecessary confusion he is burning his reputation.

By all means, market BCH as ""Satoshi's vision"" or ""the original vision of Bitcoin"" and point to the whitepaper if you like. But namings like Bitcoin (BCH) vs Bitcoin Core (BTC) are nonsensical as creating excess confusion doesn't help the adoption of cryptos in any way.  "

"I have seen you use the *Bitcoin SL* term in the past but I have no clue what you mean.

Care to elaborate?"
This is a very dumb comment. It's about PoW, about the number of calculations that have been done on the chain. Bch is 7000 blocks ahead of Btc but is Far behind in hashed calculations. 
"I have to disagree. The white paper clearly makes most cumulative proof of work the arbiter of what exactly is ""valid"" for ""Bitcoin"" (well, aside from the part where Satoshi conflates the longest chain with most cumulative proof of work). So even if someone made all the changes you describe, if that implementation earns the most cumulative proof of work, then by Nakamoto consensus, those are now the ""valid"" rules.  

Personally, I'd add a few other restrictions for what could legitimately be considered Bitcoin. For instance, a candidate would need to issue from the original Bitcoin Genesis Block, and would still need to use SHA256 proof of work (barring some flaw or mathematical advance that renders the algo unsuitable).  

e: spelling an grammar"
"> The chain with the most PoW is not per se the ""real"" chain.

I disagree.  I say,

> It is strictly necessary that the longest chain is always considered the valid 
one. Nodes that were present may remember that one branch was there first and 
got replaced by another, but there would be no way for them to convince those 
who were not present of this. We can't have subfactions of nodes that cling to 
one branch that they think was first, others that saw another branch first, and 
others that joined later and never saw what happened. The CPU power 
proof-of-work vote must have the final say. The only way for everyone to stay 
on the same page is to believe that the longest chain is always the valid one, 
no matter what.

(Ok, I didn't really say that, but whoever said it, they were right)

If miners are able to

> make a fork of bitcoin that removes the 21 million cap, reduces the blocksize limit to 50KiB and allows arbitrary TX reversals by a third party, and somehow base it on the existing chain **and accumulate more PoW**

then that will be Bitcoin.  I bolded that last text because obviously it's trivial to code up the changes you suggest.  What would not be trivial is convincing the market to pay ~$10K/coin for these new coins being mined, which is the **only** way to accumulate more proof of work.

But.  You were the one who proposed that the market would pay more for these new coins being mined when you said that the new chain would get more proof of work.  That's baked into your assumption.

So. If this nearly-impossible feat of economic hoodwinking were to be pulled off, then yes, it would perforce mean that the market recognized the new chain as ""Bitcoin"" because it was paying for ""more proof of work."""

According to the white paper, I think this is backwards. The most cumulative proof of work *establishes* which rules are valid according to consensus, and that's how Bitcoin is designed to evolve.  

So for Bitcoin Cash, we're currently trying to become ""Bitcoin"" by achieving most cumulative proof of work. In other words, BCH is demonstrating the process of Nakamoto Consensus in action, but it's still in the midst of trying to earn that consensus. If BCH never achieves most cumulative proof of work, it not only wouldn't be ""valid"" per the original ""Bitcoin"" white paper, there should probably be an addendum to the white paper written up legitimizing its own consensus rules in order to document what's ""valid"" for Bitcoin Cash, and how it can evolve by its own mechanism. That new document would then be the ""Bitcoin Cash White Paper"".

"Your stance on most accumulated work defines bitcoin is nonsense.

1) Suppose the majority of miners would go and mine a chain that had the 21-million coin limit lifted, would you consider that Bitcoin then? No of course not. It's a consensus rule regarded as sacrosanct, you wouldn't care that that chain has more POW, it's meaningless.

2) Suppose hypothetically a sudden and massive shift in hashpower would happen and BCH where to gain the majority hashrate. BTC would still have more accumulated POW, but it'd be functionally dead because barely any blocks would get found, nobody could use it at all. The time to difficulty adjustment would recedes to infinity while the price crashes to near zero before it becomes so illiquid you can't trade it at all. Would you still consider that Bitcoin then? No of course not.

3) Suppose aforementioned hashrate calamity would happen forcing BTC to hardfork to introduce at least a dynamic difficulty adjustment such as the one that exists in BCH. They'd still have more accumulated POW but far less hashrate, but would you still consider that Bitcoin? Well maybe, but then, why isn't BCH?

4) Same supposition on the hashrate calamity, do you think it'd make people who've already decided there's no other Bitcoin than the one BSCore peddles accept something else as Bitcoin? Well of course not, then why should people who accept BCH as Bitcoin be any different? Why don't we have the right to reject what BSCore has done to Bitcoin and reclaim what we understand Bitcoin to be and say it is Bitcoin?

5) SegWit coin is on a functional level incompatible with Bitcoin. The reason is simple, a miner that is unaware of the extended block section and consensus rules (i.e. mines the original Bitcoin), will accept a transaction that violates SegWit rules and include it in a block. This block will then be rejected by SegWit miners. From the miners perspective this is no different than a hardfork. I.e. SegWit is effectively a hardfork, just as hardforks are hardforks. Just because something hardforks doesn't mean it's no longer what it used to be. BCHs hardfork was forced upon it because of SegWit. It was the only viable way to retain what Bitcoin is in the face that the majority of hashrate decided to mine something that wasn't.

----

Furthermore your stance on not supporting BCH is bullshit. Here's why: More than 2 years ago you said you'd support **a** HF away from Core's leadership. You didn't qualify your statement to mean ""only if the majority of hashrate supports it"" or any such thing. You tried your version of such a HF with SegWit2X, which failed. It didn't fail on account of minority hashrate, it failed altogether to attract any hashrate whatsoever. There is a fork that has some respectable/functional hashrate and that is BCH. Back 2 years ago you didn't qualify your statement as ""but only if it's the fork I make"". You said **a** fork. Well now we have **a** fork, that works, and is supported by some amount of hashrate, but still, you won't support it? And that doesn't strike you as some form of hypocrisy?"
That's because trolls only care about price. 
There's also blatant vote-botting in this thread, keep seeing posts with a lot of upvotes that don't agree with OP go from 30+ upvotes to 0 in the matter of minutes. They're getting really desperate it seems
I’d apply the same definition, thus wouldn’t need to change my mind. The white paper is pretty clear about what Bitcoin is. If BCH gained majority sentiment/market cap and this accumulated pow, there would be a strong argument it was Bitcoin at that point. I doubt that will occur now, but it might.
Bcash split off with around 5% consensus, Segwit happened with about 100% consensus, this means Bcash is a failed upgrade that is rejected by the MAINchain and BTC is successfully upgraded with Segwit via consensus. Satoshi left the project and left it to the community to further improve the code through consensus. Consensus was clearly SATOSHI'S VISION. BTC = Bitcoin and BCH is Bcash, everyone who claims different is a scammer. Try to synchronize the Bcash chain with the original Bitcoin software from a few years ago, won't work, BTC does.
Run a node from July 2017 and let it sync, it will sync BTC chain, it will not recognize the BCH as valid blocks. 
"I agree with Greg and Adam's sentiment here. Any chain must be valid for it's chainwork to even count at all. The problem is there is no authoritative truth on what exactly ""valid"" *means*. Everyone chooses what ""valid"" means to them and the market decides what's worth how much. Who is anyone to say that a particular chain is not valid because its blocks are too big? Ther're not too big for me so I call it valid, and that's my prerogative. "
Which simply means BCH's chain is BCH, since you're running BCH, not Bitcoin.
But you must have a majority of sock puppet nodes for your break with the mining cartel to count. /s
The brigading is surreal today. It really makes me excited because it means bitcoin legacy knows its days are numbered
Any post with r/bitcoin mods or big Core personalities has brigading.
"Mining is an incentive system. Can you elaborate further why miner should switch? You get that 32 Mb blocks create more costs for miners with almost zero benefits in reward?

Average block reward 

Fees: $4,383 (0.49 BTC) , $10 (0.01 BCH)

!remindme 6 months"
Yep. And it is inevitable it will happen. Have the popcorn ready.
I did back a HF away from Core. It was called SegWit2x.
This guy is nothing more than a back peddling pedophile lol. who cares 
Definitely no brigading going on here. No-sir-ee. 
BCH is one thing: embarrassing.
This thread is being spammed by rBitcoin trolls.
Dont be a cuck Erik
This is bullshit, I call vote brigading.
Erik is kinda right. Roger is moving too fast, although he has every right to. I can understand both perspectives. But, HOLY SHIT, it's a civilized disagreement. So rare much wow
Umm Erik, which fork has a chain of signatures back to the genesis block again?  u/evoorhees
The first BitCoin Cash block was over 1MB, and therefore invalid from the point of view of BTC's chain, so that whole argument doesn't make sense in this context. BTC is not the real bitcoin for other, more apparent reasons.
What I don't understand is why Erik said he would publicly support a hardfork away from Core's leadership if they didn't support a blocksize increase. Then, when they chose not to support a blocksize increase and Bitcoin Cash hardforked away, he remained silent.
So when BCH has the majority of hashing power it will be Bitcoin? Sounds good to me.
"From the white paper:

>The proof-of-work also solves the problem of determining representation in majority decision making. If the majority were based on one-IP-address-one-vote, it could be subverted by anyone able to allocate many IPs. Proof-of-work is essentially one-CPU-one-vote. The majority decision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested in it. If a majority of CPU power is controlled by honest nodes, the honest chain will grow the fastest and outpace any competing chains. To modify a past block, an attacker would have to redo the proof-of-work of the block and all blocks after it and then catch up with and surpass the work of the honest nodes. We will show later that the probability of a slower attacker catching up diminishes exponentially as subsequent blocks are added.

My understanding is that POW is a decision making system which only applies to chains **following the same rule set**. The total POW 'truth concept' is not applicable to chains post hard fork as the communities have decided to go their separate ways. Therefore, there is neither a need for inter-hardfork decision making post-fork nor a possibility that post-fork chains could ever reach consensus by definition.

I think Erik and others have this wrong. 

The 'True Bitcoin' is more appropriately defined by its economic vision of monetary sovereignty for individuals rather than by the details of the underlying computer code which enable that vision."
"~~Time to stop referencing him then.~~ I see now that Roger was merely calling him out for not continuing to back hardforks in order to split from Core, such as he did himself. In any case it's probably not necessary to spend much time on. He may simply not have liked this particular fork as much as he did SegWit2X.

In regards to which is the ""real"" Bitcoin, the difference is that some do not accept the SL chain as being the majority chain in context of all of the requirements. 

Such as SegWit by some not being considered the chain of signatures defining a coin in the design and introducing a risk to the network, hence also to legacy addresses. Or even varying properties, such as the very important one of having a low fee which is influenced by another variable, the blocksize.

In any case Bitcoin BCH is never Bitcoin BTC at the same time and the properties of both systems make it clear what we are speaking of.

Saying that ""Bitcoin Cash is the real Bitcoin"" can be an obvious philosophical statement. Provided the context is right it doesn't have to be fraud."
"Even though I agree with his sentiment, he is technically wrong. The chain with the most PoW is not per se the ""real"" chain.  If you could make a fork of bitcoin that removes the 21 million cap, reduces the blocksize limit to 50KiB and allows arbitrary TX reversals by a third party, and somehow base it on the existing chain and accumulate more PoW, that would still be an altcoin. The longest chain rule only applies to chains that actually follow the valid rules of the protocol. What determines the valid rules of the protocol? Consensus."
"My as-yet unanswered [response](https://twitter.com/zbingledack/status/989702730619932672?s=19) to him on twitter:

>Erik - we all know hashpower follows price and that ""the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent"" (i.e., many months or even years).

>This means the contest can last a long time.

>Will you consider BCH Bitcoin if and when it emerges as the most-work chain?

As a fellow supporter of Austrian economics, I invite Erik to read my post [How NOT to tell which is ""the real Bitcoin""](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8f26vt/how_not_to_tell_which_is_the_real_bitcoin/), which covers a scenario I mentioned on forums years ago, where the next exponentially bigger wave of newbies are propagandized into supporting Keynesian policies and a ""Fedcoin"" branch of Bitcoin gains market dominance (and therefore hashpower dominance) for a time. That was before I knew Theymos and other ministers of propaganda would accomplish similar result all by themselves."
"It's not the longest chain that matters in the short term. 

What matters is adoption - the so called *economic code* of Bitcoin. If you win the network-effect then eventually you become the most profitable to mine, and will in future end-up accumulating the most aggregated pow. 
 
The way to do this, is to be ready to take the transaction load when/if BTC fees again rise to some ridiculous amount, without any safety-valve with layer-two/Lightning. BTC devs have backed themselves into a corner on this topic.

Also (and more controversially), someone is going to do second-layer stuff right at some point - but it is not clear this will happen quickly with vendors already leaving the system.  And it will probably need to bootstrap off of the network-effects and existing infrastructure of a high-transaction network - like Bitcoin Cash. "
"Absolutely ridiculous and frankly embarrassing. Erik Voorhees /u/evoorhees attacks Roger Ver /u/MemoryDealers for something he didn't say or even imply. Voorhees, who is someone I used to have a lot of respect for (diminishing...) does not have the moral high ground here. It's easy to pick on the much maligned Ver and score internet points from troll and bot armies as well as from the deluded mobs of certain censored forums. He's cowering away from his own earlier statements and backstabbing Ver who ostensibly aims for the same ""toward peace, markets, and Bitcoin"" slogan Voorhees touts on his twitter page. Inexcusable IMO."
the question is whether he will keep that opinion intact if and when Bitcoin (BTC) ceases being the chain originating from the genesis block with the highest accumulated proof of work. 
"We really should stop obsessing about Twitter on-liners. But it's also important to point out the following:

The chain with the highest accumulated proof of work is the authoritative chain, but **only among nodes that follow the same consensus rules.**

Once you have a planned split such that there are two sets of nodes, each set having its own consensus rules, **each set has its own longest authoritative chain**.

At that point we need to distinguish between the two sets of nodes. So we will need a hierarchical system, just like Internet domains. Just as you can have domains bitcoin.org and bitcoin.com, the identical labels ""bitcoin"" being in two different domain hierarchies, so can you have identical coins called Bitcoin, so long as we use some label to distinguish between the two sets of nodes.

So we can call one set of nodes the Core nodes, and another the Cash nodes. And the longest chains can then be called the Bitcoin Core chain and the Bitcoin Cash chain respectively. Within each set of nodes, so long as the context is clear, we can simply refer to the Bitcoin chain without ambiguity. But globally we will want to always use the longer names Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Cash.**‡**

━━━━━━━━

**‡**And a footnote should alert the reader that Core is often the default namespace."
"Ugh, that hurrrts.

Lesson to take from it:

1.) Maybe we should stop being annoying to some people who already made their mind?

2.) Miners are important. We know. High fees at btc chain will indeed secure miners profits and attention. Bch is moving cost of transaction from users towards miners. There is no incentive for them to switch to bch unless its difficulty is low and require small resources to mine, or.....we gain enough users to convince miners that bch has future to exist and grow!!! Btc with current model might never go above its ath price and adoption. It has hit the ceiling lately and now is a little under, but not much space to grow.

Let's focus on adoption.

3.) The Bitcoin failed to gain majority of miners. I agree to that, but is gaining them. Let's gain users first though.

Edit: I would like to add, that currently btc is still powerful even though failed its purpose. If you think about it, as much as costly, it is still easy to sell btc to fiat pretty much any amount within 30 minutes. I can find buyer or seller to meet face to face probably in similar period of time. With bch things are much much harder. There is less of us. There is big propaganda against us. Our chain is better in every way, but we have soooooo much to do. Don't waste time.

Edit2  I fell in love in bitcoin in 2011 and I will never forget that. I will also recognise my love even if core trolls will cover it in shit. Bitcoin (bch) is my love."
There has been a lot of brigading this past week. Guess the price increase has riled up the trolls. 
Bitcoin Cash hasn't gained majority yet, who is to say that it never does? Would Erik change his mind then?
This is going to entertaining to revisit.
"""No, Erik, the chain must be VALID for the proof of work to even count."" - Greg, Adam, and everyone who ever bought a UASF hat.

If only life was that black and white. 
WHY ARE WE UPVOTING THIS? SHUT IT DOWN!!
This tweet will not age well. When Bitcoin Cash price goes above the parity level with Bitcoin SegShit/LolNet, all the hash rate will permanently flip to Bitcoin Cash as it will remain the most profitable, thus causing the old chain to slow to a crawl as it struggles for the next 2016 blocks to continue. The Chain Death Spiral will actually happen. Then the old chain will lose its majority proof of work and die off. We're already at 0.15 BTC which is higher than any alt coin. Just a bit more adoption to go.
just wait Erik, just wait for a little longer and we'll have this talk then ...

"> “Bitcoin is the chain originating from the genesis block with the highest accumulated proof of work”

that's a well formulated *opinion* you have there /u/evoorhees, it would serve you well to keep in mind that it's not a fact. If we're sticking to facts, then the chain originating from the genesis block with the highest accumulated proof of work is merely the *dominant SHA256 blockchain*. Whether that chain fits the definition of 'bitcoin' or not is another question entirely"
Mo drama, mo money
His argument seems sound, but it is flawed. Bitcoin is the *VALID* chain originating from the genesis block with the highest accumulated proof of work. What is valid is subjective, so it all depends on your point of view. 
"No segwitcoin breaks the definition of a chain of signatures in the white paper as Peter Rizun explains: https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7tvk46/since_people_are_still_confused_about_the/

Edit: replaced wrong link"

And now people are confused, thank you very much, Bitcoin Cash!
No Eric, Bitcoin is a P2P electonic cash system with the highest accumulated proof work and this which mean Bitcoin Cash is the real bitcoin.
Why do we care what Erik thinks anymore.  He's played his hand and chose not to support bitcoin peer to peer electronic cash and be an apologist for the subversion. Too bad.
Nah, no thanks.  If you break it, you own it!!!  The name will live on in BCH.  How pathetic of you.
So your saying when BCH gains majority Hash Power it'll be bitcoin.  But beforehand its it isn't.  Hmmm.. ok  Lets have this conversation in a few more weeks.
I already lost most respect for Eric a while ago so this isn't as hurtful to me as when he originally didn't support it, oh well. 
"You know, it just occurred to me that according to bitcoin.com terminology, this is now the Bitcoin Core subreddit:

I'm done with this spineless sellout
/u/cryptochecker
"While highest accumulated proof of work is likely the best measure, the white paper does say ""the longest chain""... so if your measure is the white paper then BCH is actually Bitcoin.

Of course there's also an implicit assumption that the accumulated proof of work is a __valid__ chain. So if your measure is that SegWit breaks the chain of signatures that defines the digital currency then BCH is actually Bitcoin.

It's kind of an inescapable conclusion when you actually take everything into account...

...OK now I better duck."
Yet.
Roger is doing marketing and branding work. He knows getting this discussion on the burner raises visibility. It's not really about the tech specs for him. And it's working.
Can I just say how hilarious this whole thing is.  Please?  Thank you.  This.  Is.  Hilarious.  Nobody gives 2 fucks anymore.  Seriously.  Throw in the towel and move on.  
Maybe we should start this debate when BCH reaches 70% of BTC POW?
If anyone has a problem with using the hashing power to decide which chain is the fork away from the original, you need to take a look at your own personal hang ups. If you believe BCH is superior, you should have no problem remaining patient and focusing on adoption. Turning into a zealot only lowers yourself to the level of the core trolls.
"Now Erik thinks he owns the trademark.

For fucks sake learn how forks work people. They are both bitcoin."
Ouch. Well thanks to shapeshift people can exit blockstream easier now than ever

The longest weakest attack on bitcoin ever.  lol the whole  lot of you are sad.
"You are completely wrong regarding miners - unless they are a charitable institution, the hash rate on bch and btc will be proportional to the ratio between the two.

The softfork happened due to the fear of the speculator masses and others of a split, and due to the promise of the NYC agreement 2X max blocksize increase which got things going (following the endless debate and other agreements years prior). An agreement Erik supported.

While maintaining majority HashPower, BitcoinCore succeeds in shrinking BlockSize from 1Mb to fit only one transaction per block. Would you still call that Bitcoin? How about no transactions per Block? Surely with that logic, and majority HashPower is still Bitcoin, no? With all due respect Sir, have you read the white paper? Do you comprehend concept of A Peer\-to\-Peer Electronic Cash System?"
"Assuming miners operate under a pure profit motivation, they'll switch when the market determines each BCH token is worth more than a BTC token.  

> You get that 32 Mb blocks create more costs for miners with almost zero benefits in reward?  

What? This is entirely mistaking a **limit** with actual larger blocks. Even with a 32 MB block size limit, BCH will not have larger blocks than those on average on the BTC block chain, even if it absorbs BTC's entire transaction volume. So cost to miners will be almost exactly the same in both cases."

The chain with SegWit+Legacy transactions. 
The white paper is not a religious text. Our understanding of Bitcoin changes with time. Look to people who were cited in the white paper (Eg, Adam Back) and follow their lead if you are uncertain. 
I don't have a Memo account yet. Japan makes this very difficult taxwise at this time, as they require in principle every single transaction to be declared as either one to your own address or one to another's address, as well as other complications and ambiguities. Dealing with this for 2017 already took three weeks of my time. Any wallet devs and app devs looking to gain adoption in Japan should be aware of this. There is a big opportunity for someone to make accounting software that handles this. Though Japan will hopefully relax their policies soon.
"Oh, so you believe in the white paper and its precepts, do you? So what do you say about the fact that activated SegWit on the BTC block chain right now is fully illegitimate because it only got there by subverting the white paper's prescribed Nakamoto Consensus? SegWit activation would only have been justified if the ""2x"" portion of the SegWit2x consensus agreement was added. That's the aspect of the consensus agreement that raised support for SegWit1x from the 30%-35% that it had languished in for months (never once exceeding 40% support), to the overwhelming 90%+ support SegWit2x had at lock in time. This shows the crucial aspect for support was the ""2x"" component, not SegWit, and therefore the BTC block chain with activated SegWit but no ""2x"" is not valid in claiming the ""Bitcoin"" name per the white paper's own expressed consensus mechanism."

XT -> Classic -> Unlimited -> Bitcoin cash. These despicable and anti-libertarian policies were at best mildly chided by you, rather than clearly and publicly condemned. Had the respected voices of bitcoin spoken out against the manipulations, core wouldn't have stood a chance. Instead we've been set back years, and you are partially responsible.

"Erik I have to believe you're being intentionally vague here. To anyone reading, here's Erik's answer in this thread when asked if he'd change his mind if BCH accumulates longest PoW chain:

""I’d apply the same definition, thus wouldn’t need to change my mind. The white paper is pretty clear about what Bitcoin is. If BCH gained majority sentiment/market cap and this accumulated pow, there would be a strong argument it was Bitcoin at that point. I doubt that will occur now, but it might.""

"
"A fascinating argument that I do not entirely disagree with. The whitepaper talks about a single chain split, i.e., two competing chains, but not a network split, i.e., two disjoint sets of nodes.

Chains can split multiple times, like bacteria, leading to many subchains. At some point you might have two sets of chains, and a close competition within each set, but the two sets might be long-lived **if for some reason the nodes themselves split into two sets**. A set of nodes A might only be looking at a set of chains A. Likewise a set of nodes B and a set of chains B.

Now within set A, chains compete for the status of longest chain. In parallel, within set B, chains compete for the status of longest chain. But since the nodes exist in two different sets, there is no competition between the longest chain in set A and the longest chain in set B."

"Not really. Theres a small window of opportunity when you fork to convincingly claim the name. Either you kill off the original chain, or the original chain is left in a completely inoperative state, with no exchanges accepting it, little to no hashpower, no usage etc.

The bitcoin name doesnt flip-flop between chains just because hashpower changes. Thats an absurd concept. Imagine it:

> ""Well I had 1 bitcoin that you transferred to me yesterday, but today I have none because its no longer bitcoin. X is now bitcoin. Y might be bitcoin the day after"".

or

> ""Breaking news: Bitcoin transactions from 1 aug 2017 till now have been rolled back. A new history of bitcoin transactions have been established, as the old bitcoin is no longer bitcoin because that other bitcoin has become bitcoin"".

Segwit2x had a chance at becoming bitcoin. If all exchanges and vendors had accepted it, and hashpower left the 1x chain I'd have to call it bitcoin.

But when you fork off, call it bitcoin cash, change the difficulty algo to not die a fast death, wait months and months with no sign of ""flippening"" no one serious is going to view it as bitcoin no matter what happens.

A whole other question is what if bitcoin decides to change mining algo? Then hashrates are incommensurable and you can't use that argument at all. Then how do you decide? Must bitcoin always be SHA256?"

Bitcoin Core did not 'steal' the name bitcoin. Bitcoin Core just implements  a Protocol and the name Bitcoin stays with the most accumulated work of any chain that originates from the genesis block. As of today, the most accumulated work is on the chain that uses the protocol that 'Bitcoin Core' implements.

Pretty simple if you leave out the politics.

"> Segwit transations didn't exist, so saying ""invalid segwit transactions"" makes no sense.

That is incorrect. Please stop spreading lies. An old miner can and will include a SegWit transaction, it just won't know how to handle it.

There are numerous guides, and numerous guides were posted, about needing to have a SegWit-aware edge node, or you'd run the risk of losing your block reward if you mined a transaction that was invalid.

If SegWit needed an upgrade on miners/nodes, that makes it a fork. Was it an hard fork? No, it didn't add anything that was previously invalid. Therefore, it was a soft fork. What was made invalid? SegWit transactions, that previously weren't processed just included, that weren't valid under SegWit rules.

It's that simple. No they weren't understood, yes they were included, and if they were invalid since a SegWit-unaware miner included them, the block would be dropped by SegWit nodes and miners."
But fees are allowed to be zero, no?
"> Either way the miner could jus t upgrade and not mine any segwit tx for their policy.

Still requires an upgrade to be aware of segwit, thus making segwit mandatory.

Whoever controls the nodes now controls which forks are accepted, since node-activated soft-forks have been shown to work and to be loved by the community.

The Bitcoin Core community now supports the most dangerous attack on cryptocurrencies, a sybil attack, as a positive thing that can and should be used to push forward contentious forks.

A Sybil attack managed to cause a split in the community and a hardfork, and they/you love it."
It’s coming back up soon. 
Ask yourself, is a spam attack expensive if you control a meaningful amount of hash power? All of the transaction fees come back to you. And you can bully other miners off the network who don’t have petabytes of SSDs, increasing your share of winning blocks. 
">  But that's also the entire point of UASF and proves the point that miners are hired security, not rule makers.

Doesn't prove anything, it proves that a sybil attack works, and the Bitcoin Core community for some reason sees that as positive.

The most dangerous type of attack as it doesn't even require a lot of money being spent, just access to a few thousand IPs (which every single company and nearly every government has) to subvert the network by performing a sybil attack and dropping blocks that contain transactions they dislike (or, in that case, that don't accept forks they like)."
Nah, most nodes drop zero fee transactions.
"Seriously? Even if half comes back to you it would still cost a fortune (And you're breaking your own business model when you have that much mining power).

If you have such a ""meaningful"" amount of hashing power you could just take over and destroy the network, no need for spam attacks, lol."
Oh, so you're saying if a miner doesn't upgrade, then he can processes an invalid transactions.  That is true.   But that's also the entire point of UASF and proves the point that miners are hired security, not rule makers.
Wy isn't the FAQ stickied anymore? I think it is more important that stickying the hard fork...
"As the blocks get full, it's no longer the 1 satoshi spam transactions getting included in a block.  The attacker is just adding fee pressure and after a certain point, it costs nothing because everyone is outbidding them.   

 

"
"This is one of those situations where after nothing has gone wrong come may 15 and the uncertainty is over, it will be a massive positive price catalyst. I think the flippening is getting closer.

"Segwit tx fail isStandard and cleanstack tho for old nodes. Either way the miner could jus

"> Invalid segwit transactions are valid under old block rules. 

Segwit transations didn't exist, so saying ""invalid segwit transactions"" makes no sense.    Segwit transactions are NEW transaction format.  All old transactions still work.   Segwit is an OP-IN transaction type.  "
You're getting downvoted but you're right, this is how hard forks work. 
We already had this at 8 MB blocks with massive spam attacks.. guess what happened? Some actual 8 MB blocks were worked on and a few blocks later everything was fine again. Even though the fees are low, they are not that low, it would still cost millions to spam and cripple the network (And the moment you stop the large blocks quickly work through the transactions). Even with a massive attack we would just have a full mempool (Like Bitcoin) but it would get worked off in no time.

I would argue (perhaps against general sentiment) that value isn't what we should strive for with BCH. We want a long chain. We want transactions. We need to increase merchant adoption and ease of use. Those are priorities. Without those, there is no need to guess on value.
