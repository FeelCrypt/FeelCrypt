"Ledger CEO here.

This is a low tech scam, not involving any tampering of the device (no need to do that). It relies on the fact that new users wouldn't find strange to have a predefined seed.

It is quite difficult to mitigate this kind of scams. Even with the warning on our apps page (https://www.ledgerwallet.com/apps) users are not paying a lot of attention when using the devices. Having a ""anti tamper seal"" wouldn't do much. In this case there wasn't even a plastic wrap on the casing and it didn't create any suspicion. Moreover, it is trivial to duplicate any cardbox or anti tampering seal.

Our actions regarding this scam are the following:

- we have contacted all victims of the scams and we are creating a task force with our General Counsel and a jut hired Trust & Safety Manager . We'll help file formal criminal complaint and will do everything we can to bring the scammer(s) to justice
- we are implemting extra safety protocols in our firmware to notify the apps in case a PIN has been changed or a seed has been restored to display warnings and reminders about the importance of having self generating the seed
- we are adding more enphasis on seed safety management on our FAQs and tutorials

This is just the beginning. With an incoming trillion dollars crypto market cap and millions of new uses worldwide, low tech and high tech scams will be more and more present. It is our global responsability as hardware wallet makers to prevent any counterfeit (for instance through cryptographic attestation) and enforce safety protocols ensuring the user is aware he must have generated the seed on her own."
They're in stock at amazon
"I just got mine this week, timing was.  

Ordered 12/14 
Shipped 12/25
Received 1/2


Eastern Timezone US

"
Just bought 2 ledgers that arrived in a week. I'm currently in Europe though (not France).
How long has there been a delay?
Ah yes, I hate when my ledger that takes a 3 month wait to the US from france takes 4 business days.
That was true back 7 months ago. By now they ship within a week (did it, am from GER. Should be not that different then FR).
I'd wait it out and I will. This year I'll be buying a hardware wallet. Not sure which to get yet. 
It's only a month now that they are in still, I will have my soon and less than a month
"Get a Trezor. Wait for it. 

Comes sealed vs. physical attacks and make sure it is shipped direct from manufacturer."
Since when? I ordered 2 recently. Couple weeks. 
No it isn't.
Amazon.jp got them.
Or, you know. Just use a normal light wallet like electrum and store the seed on paper?
False. I ordered mine 3 days before Christmas and got to my door 2 days ago. Shipped from ledger from France. Maybe in some cases but not all. 
Secure wallet worth the wait. Until it arrives I'd choose paper wallet in that situation
"> If you want to get a hardware wallet in any kind of a reasonable time, you have to buy it from a third party. 

Trezor ships within 3 days, DHL delivery takes 2-5 days."
Where are you getting it shipped to? I got mine in a week. Ledger has stock of nano s i the states at least. (Now getting it to actually work has yet to happen but I got the device...)
I got mine in 5 days. In Australia. 
The Ledger website lists authorized purchase outlets...Where I purchased a new, sealed Ledger that arrived within 5 days, and without the crazy international shipping fees.  I DID follow Reddit advice and set it up, transfer a small amount of LTC to it, intentionally wipe it, and retrieve it before transferring any large amounts.
Or use a paper wallet until a hardware wallet is available...
omg......that story is so sad that the dog lost his bone in the process of trying to get two bones :(
Oh, cool.  
"Number 2. should be: Configure hardware wallet and print out private key for yourself and the buyer.

"
As far as I'm aware the components of the Ledger hw wallets can't be changed without being rendered inoperable, so the device itself should in theory be completely safe no matter where you get it from, as long as you generate new seeds from it and don't use ones provided. 
"I think you'll need to also change the software that runs on the computer that validates the firmware. 

But yeah, not buying directly from the manufacturer does increase the risk you'll get an adulterated wallet."
"I ordered ledger on 1st of january and it wa shipped two days ago, expecting it next week.

//funny shit this ""free shipping"" bullshit, its like 12€ more expensive than my order from the 1st, I paid 83€ with shipping, now it costs 95€ with ""free shipping""."
">Otherwise, you have to wait to buy Bitcoin, or keep it on an exchange.


I've never used a hardware wallet and don't imagine I ever will.  "
Wow I bought mine 5 days ago. Glad I did I got it in 2 days... Now it's on preorder and the price was hiked by 20 euros...
No it's not. I got mine in 5 days shipped to California.
If 2018 is like 2017 then I sure will. But right now it's too soon to do that. I slowly put more and more into stocks but even with a stock portfolio making me gains greater than 200% annually they've paled in comparison to crypto.
"It's the fundamental flaw of all crypto, and the fundamental reason why the banking system isn't going away.

Because that's what banks *are*. Fundamentally, an insured place where people can store their most theft-prone assets in a way that's risk-free to the individual. Banks evolved because people *needed to store their gold somewhere*.

This is not a solvable problem for digital currencies. The technical wherewithal to truly securely store digital currency is beyond 99% of users, because practically no one makes their own CPUs and writes their own wallet software. And if someone does, there's always kidnapping and torture for ransom.

The traceability of traditional currency and reversibility of transactions *is a good thing*. What we need is for us to build trustworthy governments and institutions, not to give up and run away into crypto when we fail at it.

"
"I literally know no-one who lost their coins on Mt Gox, but tons of people who God Cryptsy-ed and mintpal-ed.
And I still keep a decent chunk of my portfolio on exchanges due to pure laziness..."
"It's just growing pains as new tech, better UI, and new norms and ""conventional wisdom"" emerge. Credit cards are full of traps for the unwary consumer as well, and some are always caught, but the memes around credit cards warn enough people that the system works sort of all right. With Bitcoin it is perfectly possible to make a cold storage scheme that is both ultra-safe and takes no special thought on the user's part. It will just take time and ingenuity, on top of societal norms and wisdom development. (In fact, even exchanges are far safer than they used to be, as they are learning, too.)

As someone said, we have millions of years' experience with the ins and outs of physically securing assets. The cultural meme-o-sphere and even our language has adapted to this. We have only a few years' experience with securing digital assets. "
For crypto. Yes. Agreed. Big requirement though. FOR CRYPTO. 
"Now if only there was some way to stop said institutions from taking absurd risks with our savings, destroying the world economy, demanding bailouts from Uncle Sam, then giving themselves huge bonuses while the world burns... Damnit, some kind of FEDcoin with built-in transfer security looks better and better...

Edit : Clearly there is a place for Banks in the brave new Crypto future. If this guy had $34,000 in his mattress and someone broke in and stole it, this wouldn't even be news. Its just not safe to store vast sums of 'future money' in your house, in any format."
IRA
Trezor does a good job of this with fully open source firmware and deterministic builds. 
While waiting 2 months for my ledger I bought a fire proof safe and installed CCTV! It cost £300. I still know it's not 100% but you have to put in the effort. And BTW I already knew after reading a few reviews NOT to buy from a third party.
"> Well you also called Bitcoin a Ponzi to the SEC, so maybe people don't actually trust you anymore

I also got booed for that letter, of course; even by people who have not read it, and just assumed that I called bitcoin a Ponzi.  

And yet the only rebuttal to that letter that bitcoiners sent to the SEC could find only one thing wrong with it: the fact that I am a contributor to /r/buttcoin."
"As jstolfi explained above, a big thing is it also protects against malware when you spend your coins. If you often send crypto and actively trade with it then it's definitely worth thinking about.  If you just want to store it then it doesn't offer much extra security.

I personally don't have a hardware wallet, but I also don't have a very large amount of crypto and don't spend or trade regularly."
Silly until you get hacked
The wallet was genuine and unmodified. This scam was equivalent to selling a pre-printed paper wallet and keeping a copy of the private key. It depended on a fatal error of ignorance on the part of the buyer.
Anybody who doesn't want to secure their own crypto can put it into one or more of dozens of online wallet services, just like banks do for fiat cat
"The entire computer industry is at fault.

Intell's CPUs for the last decade has a bug that will allow just about any program to trivially access even VM memory.

Every decade it's been ignored only made it worse. Now real security is necessary so it's going to be painful."
It doesn't really have to be as complicated as that.  One solution for long term storage or for savings is paper wallets.  You can simply download a wallet generator, take your computer offline, print it offline to a hardwired printer, and put it in a locked box hidden away.  Just keep the public key (the address) handy and any time you want to deposit funds to that address you can do so (you do not need the hard copy, just a copy of the public key).  Whenever you want to eventually spend those funds, you can just use a mobile wallet like breadwallet or mycelium to import the private key by scanning the QR code on the paper wallet.  That will sweep all of the funds onto your mobile device, from which you can spend it or send it to any other address.  I recommend laminating paper wallets and keeping in a fire-proof safe.
Yes...
I use exodus, and havn't had any problems, but I rarely log into my wallet, and I scrub my computer with a virus scan daily.
"I bought a ledger hardware wallet and waited months to get it. The recent drama aside, it's been working out pretty well for me. 

I bought a trezor hardware wallet back in the day. (edit: I was one of the last users to pay 1btc for it. It was a couple hundred dollars then.) I had issues with it not wanting to talk to my PC every third time I plugged it in. I wasn't comfortable leaving any significant amount of money on it after that happened a few times. Their QA/build process/whatever may have improved since then, I can't say.

I also like the bitcoin.com wallet - pretty simple to use, and I'm reasonably comfortable recommending it to people who don't live-and-breath bitcoin information. It's neat in that it can share balances between mobile and desktop - but of course doing that invites risk. Be careful."
Why ledger would be secure for 10k and not 30k?
"Yeah, completely offline computer and printer. (Destroying them afterward?)

Verify checksum of wallet generator software use.

Test and test again few paperwallet before putting the money on one.

Don’t use a office photocopier to make backup. (Some have internat HD)

Be sure your computer had enough time to build up entropy before generating your wallet (maybe wait a bit after start up to generate your wallet).

I never use a multi sig setup for cold storage, it might be more secure..

Maybe a multisig set up with one signature held in a HW be the best compromise?"
There are actually more than the two options that you list, but perhaps spewing this misinformation is why people are able to get scammed as easily as they are.
">It's not that simple. It's a 3 month wait to get a Ledger from France.

No it is that simple. You don't expose uninsured (FDIC) financial accounts of any type with substantial value to the outside world. You create proxy accounts to move more reasonable sums that you expose to the world. 

Even simpler is not having your life savings in UNINSURED FINANCIAL ACCOUNTS. "
">It's a 3 month wait to get a Ledger from France.

So my options are waiting 3 months before buying bitcoin, or risking my entire life savings? Seems like a pretty easy choice unless you thinking that the banks will collapse in the next 15min."
3 months? I ordered mine on Amazon Prime and got it in 2 days...in Germany. I don't think FR is that different??
Got my trezor in less than a week shipped to PA
Imo that's the actual problem of today's world. No one wants to take  responsibility. I can fully understand that crypto is complicated, but in the end the security is in your own hands. Which is a really good thing.
I bought my ledger there and it came a ok (and very fast - not worth saving on the price or on shipping to delay protection imho), no problems so far - but make sure its from amazon 
"Not to mention a faulty returns process. I bought a top brand micro sd card from amazon.com last year. It was the original packaging, but the card had been replaced. The packaging had been opened almost unnoticeably using a razor or very sharp knife.

I was able to send it back for a refund. But it taught me not to trust Amazon to send the genuine article. 

I would NEVER use it to buy a hardware wallet. Only get one directly from the manufacturer. Yes they can still cheat you. But at least you are not expanding that list."
"No firmware is pushed. You decide to download it, only through the ledger manager app. Ok, in the google play store you can find apps that are not official ledger apps. You don’t want to use those. 

Basically it all comes down to: ‘do your homework!’ 

It’s about money and you don’t want to get it wrong. "
Lol, great idea

If your computer has never been hacked, acting that paranoid is silly.
So when the nuclear winter or asteroid impact or alien invasion destroys everyone you hold dear, at least you'll still have your crypto...

Not sure... 
Yes he was probably following one of the many recommendations against relying on cloud-based wallets and importance of owning your keys.  I am just glad he wasn't too ashamed to share it and warn others.  Even if it is BS it is a important reminder for all.
Paper wallet, or three ledgers with 10k each.
"He is implying that he should have just paid retail for it.

However, my answer is paper wallet.

A paper wallet can be generated with a computer that has never been online and will never be online.

You attach a printer to it, that likewise, will never be networked.

Print out your private and public key.

Transfer public key to networked computer via qr code.

Treat paper with private key like you would treat $34,000 with the added complication that taking a picture of it is enough to steal it.

Now your security problem is reduced to a physical security problem.

If you lose your paper (by fire or accident), you lose you money.

If someone steals or photocopies (or memorizes) the paper, you lose your money. "
"Very sad, but ultimately this is user stupidity:

1) Invest all life savings in crypto? 

2) Not checking the ledger documentation to see that it is *not* legit to get your seed from a piece of paper (with our without scratch-off layer)."
"It's not that simple. It's a 3 month wait to get a Ledger from France.

If you want to get a hardware wallet in any kind of a reasonable time, you have to buy it from a third party. Otherwise, you have to wait to buy Bitcoin, or keep it on an exchange.

Edit: For everyone saying it'll be shipped in a few days, here's Ledger's site talking about the delay.

"until someone steals your safe, lol.
"
They set the ledger up with their own empty account before shipping it out, and bundled a “recovery key sheet” in when they repackaged the unit. If you’re actually buying a new ledger, you set the account up yourself, and write down the recovery key given to you by the device.
im scared now to use the ledger i bought from THE SITE!-it had plastic seal only-i dont trust anyone anymore
Okay, but there is such a thing as being too cheap. He may have saved a few dollars up front but it ended up costing him $34K in total, so did he win or lose?
"> They're getting in because of the lure of quick profits

Yep. You know what this reminds me of? Did you ever hear the story of the dog and his bone? It goes, a dog walking along with a bone in his mouth comes to a big puddle where he sees his reflection but thinks it's another dog with another bone. He is so greedy he opens his mouth to try getting that dog's bone and loses his own in the water."
"I did this just to make sure I did everything right, turns out it is simple. However you don't know what you don't know.

OR in other words...

What you see is all there is."
"Seems to work though. I just got this:  
> u/moodyrocket, you've received 0.0005 BCH ($1.262245 USD)!"
Bingo.
"1. Buy hardware wallet
2. Change the firmware
3. Sell on eBay
4. Profit

"Good points. We are dealing with such quantities of money here that it is not surprising that malicious actors would emerge like this.

Scams have existed since the beginning of humanity undoubtably and they are present here as well.

>He followed the instructions that came in the sealed box. Unfortunately, they were scam instructions.

I meant that if you're aware of the correct instructions and follow them as stated. It should not matter who you bought it from. Right? This is the basic idea behind the security of the Ledger."
I would not buy via Amazon. Too many stories of fake products being sent and inventory being mixed between sellers so you don't even know who was the culprit.
I've been in since 2011...
As in there is some private key that ledger uses and relays on? In the end they push firmware updates as well. What’s stopping someone from creating their own firmware? I assume they document this somewhere, I’ll take a look. 
The bridge I'm selling is new.  Honest.
The OP who lost his money stated that his Ledger was sealed.  This can be found in his post here https://redd.it/7ojvca.  I am assuming this means the box was sealed with plastic wrap.  All I am saying is that an anti tamper sticker would not hurt, and to assume that it would have no benefit at all, is jumping to conclusions in my opinion.
"If there was an issue with the hardware, it would only make it insecure while connected to the internet, so having 2 would save 1. Unless you connect both at once I suppose.

Having said that I do agree with you, it has to be better to get one of each. Even if I can't think of a reason why it would matter here.

You could write and hide/store a riddle that only you could solve in case you forget it. I personally enjoy doing this, gives people a slightly better than 0% chance at unlocking my funds if something were to happen to me."
Typically offer protection for 30 minutes of fire, so it's not guaranteed anything in it will survive unburnt.
"It works the other way around. Companies doing crypto-currency should prove beyond any doubt that they can be trusted.

If Madoff was starting a Bitcoin exchange, I'm sure we'd still find people to defend him and ask the ""FUDers"" to prove that the exchange cannot be trusted."
"Your point is that everything on Ebay that is advertised as new and arrives sealed in convincing packaging is actually used?
Obviously incorrect.
"
He didn’t realise his folly until it was too late. As far as he knew his crypto was now safe as houses. 
It's a pretty trivial script...
"Most people I know IRL who are getting into crypto are playing catch-up. Most are buying ledger nano s on amazon. It wouldn't surprise me if they didn't know about the official company website.

Really not that far fetched."
You don't have to be tech savvy to buy or even trade crypto. 
Plenty of technologically illiterate people buying crypto atm. Its not that hard. I can certainly see people getting fucked by this scam
"He bought the correct wallet (Ledger Nano S), just from a bad source (ebay).  

From 2010-2016, it was mainly techies buying crypto.

But in the current crypto-mania, tons of clueless people are jumping in as fast as they can, buying random cryptocurrencies that they know nothing about.

It's like the 1999 dotcom mania, where everyone from the taxi driver & shoe shine boy was buying dotcom stocks.  My girlfriend would buy a random dotcom stock, it would go up in price, and I'd ask her what the company did as a business, and she had no idea.

I mean, look at Bitcoin Gold (BTG; #15 in market cap).  Who the hell is buying that?  A simple google search would show that they have a history of malware & scamming.  There's probably lots of newbies scanning coinmarketcap.com, and buying ""Bitcoin Gold"" because they falsely assume that it's Bitcoin backed by Gold.  After all, Peter Schiff said that if Bitcoin were backed by Gold, then that would be the winning formula."
"So, you're tech savvy enough to write in this subreddit, but not intelligent enough to get your head around the fact that it's (a lot) easier to buy crypto, than to secure it against all such threats ...? Well, I can accept that ... guess I'm more open-minded than you ;)"
"""New in Box"" for only $10 more and I can pay to get it overnighted instead of waiting for shipping from France?!?!?!? I'm IN!

It's just the nature of scams. Plus access to really good printers seals the deal."
noobs aren't known to be the world's smartest person generally.
Maybe having all your money in crypto is a bad idea, but what do you recommend he do as far as different wallets? You think he should have also bought a trezor? Or a wallet on his cell phone or computer where you can get hacked?

I wouldn't say you need large savings. I had my baby mama look them up for me while I was driving and she said it was $60 a year. USA
[deleted]
That's a security feature so if someone tries to crack your pin the funds are gone you can still restore it from the backup seed. You wouldn't even need the same wallet just an other one of the same model to restore the seed.
As long as you have the seed, you can restore your wallet on a new device if it's lost or destroyed or on the same device if it's wiped
"Likely the seed on the paper was just a copy of his own meaning the scammer had access to the private key.

The actual device wouldn't need any tampering for the scam to work."
this
They would advise cashing out and redistributing the funds... However, screw that. HODL
Not uncommon, I'm sure.
From a risk point of view, you should diversify out of crypto a bit.
This is actually pretty worrying when trying to make crypto mainstream.
Yeah I agree... I didn't even consider a HW wallet until my portfolio ballooned into the thousands (a lot of money for a poor student like me lol)
I probably know more people who've lost coins on MtGox than any other way.
"Heh. It's almost as if... uh... Bitcoin has a property of cash that it's incredibly gimmicky to securely store, and there's no recourse if someone steals it.

If only there was a solution to this problem... like, where you could trust someone to store your valuables, like an institution of some sort. Perhaps even all of these institutions would be cross-insured so that if one of them crashes, you can still get back your value. That way no one has to lose their life savings because they didn't manage to defend against thieves and kidnappers, or because they couldn't tell their chosen institution was going to crash.

Perhaps one day we'll have a system like that! One can dream! ;)"

"Multiple different hardware wallets. I'm thinking of getting a Trezor too and going 50/50 on the Trezor/Ledger. It doesn't make sense to put it on two different Ledger it'd be just as secure. But if there's a major security flaw in one model of hardware wallet then half the funds would be protected as they'd be in a different brand/model. 

My only fear is getting smacked in the head too hard and forgetting my 20+ character password that's used to decrypt the backups of my seed..."
Maybe if they sent back 90% of their money it would be educating. This is just wrong. A lot of people came up on this money before they knew what was happening. Crypto isn't easy to understand for a lot of people. It's like yelling at a toddler for not speaking correctly, we've had more time in the crypto sphere that it seems easier than it is.
"User error/unforeseen hardware/software error. With all the information we currently have, a ledger is 100% safe, ASSUMING nobody gets the seed. 

Leaking the seed one way or another is possible and the risk would be mitigated by having 2.

If a technical error occurred, it would only impact you because you have accessed the wallet. Again, if you only accessed a wallet with half your funds, only half your funds would be compromised. 

To be clear I don't believe there is any risk, but that's the argument."
Sure, nowhere is 100% safe. Would you trust a trezor in your sock drawer more? 
Unfortunately this doesn't prove much as you're still flashing from a bootloader you can't easily validate and you'd need a physical inspection of the hardware to make sure that you're communicating with the right chip. So no, being open source is definitely not enough to validate hardware properly.
"That doesn't help if they do not use a chip which can remotely verify its integrity, like Ledger does. 

Which btw still means you explicitly trust the chip manufacturer AND Ledger. There is no way around that except building everything from scratch. Or using multiple hardware wallets in a multi-sig configuration. 

"
That's the spirit.  Own your deficiencies!
Good luck and stay safe!
If you reset it and got a new seed that has never been typed on a computer or photographed on a phone you should have nothing to worry about.
Those are amazon prime and available. Seemingly legit. Did you order a ledger off there? 
A paper list of seed words would have the same vulnerabilities. 
"There are also more obscure vulnerabilities, like many printers have memory these days, so you can ""print another copy"" with a push of a button.

I don't even understand why people do paper wallets. Just email the encrypted private key to all your family, put it into any free cloud drive. "
"Just as we diversify our portfolio, we can diversify our security.  How about this as a solution for paper wallets and/or seeds?

Print several copies and keep one in a safe location at home.  For the others... Buy a few greeting cards, insert one wallet/seed list into each, seal it, and address it to yourself.  Then hand deliver it (or include it in a mailed package) to a select few trusted people.  They don’t need to know what’s in the card - just that it’s a self-reminder that you might ask for one day and that they should keep it in a safe/secure place. 

In the off chance you need one, you can get it from the closest person, or have one of the others mail the card back to you (or they can open the card and send a digital photo if you trust them - and if you transfer to a new wallet afterward).

By spreading out the recovery info it has ensured that weather, fire, water, kids, pets, etc will not destroy the info.  And it’s highly unlikely a robber would waste time examining a sealed greeting card (if they do steal the card make a new wallet and transfer immediately)."
Except the basic principle of security is that nothing is 100% safe. You are always looking for solutions that are good enough.
Or print two copies.

Obviously he didn't realize he was buying from a scammer.
Maybe crypto is not for those not able to understand
Relative to bitcoin right now it is very basic. It's like a single sentence that is easy to understand.
It's the basic level of competence you SHOULD have when entering something like this with all your life savings. But sadly I suspect it's way above what most people understand.
"Apparently they ~~do~~ (edit: claim to) keep the ability to determine where it came from, but you can still get product from seller X even if you bought from Y. Here's the official documentation explaining it:

https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/?nodeId=200243180

I've seen a lot of complaints by sellers that issues caused by other sellers affect everyone with little recourse, so maybe the separate tracking is new after too much fraud/counterfeit issues happened. This article claims Amazon can not easily trace a counterfeit to the source: https://www.google.ch/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/wadeshepard/2017/12/13/how-to-protect-your-family-from-dangerous-fakes-on-amazon-this-holiday-season/amp/"
"If I was gonna buy a pre made hardware wallet I’d probably hit up my EE buddy and go to his lab.  He is a pretty big bitcoin buff so I think he will do a good job.  Put that baby on the scope and see if there is any funny business going on.  

We once bought a programmable remote from some noname vendor on Ali Express and when we put its microcontroller under his electron microscope we could tell it was tampered with to do... well... we couldn’t figure it out but it didn’t look good at all.  Like it was trying to save a bunch of data for... something.  Spooked the shit out of us and needless to say, we tossed it out and got a good one from Costco.   As they say, trust but verify.   Lots of people trying to steal bitcoin before it goes truly mainstream!"
"This is the statement I was looking for:

> There is absolutely no way that an attacker could replace the firmware and make it pass attestation, without knowing the Ledger private key.

Looks like they maintain a private key for the firmware. I hope its secure :)"
It's just a private key printed out on paper. Not that difficult.
I agree that you should have a different address for each hardware wallet, no reason not to. I wouldn't worry, I consider them very very safe. You can never be too secure though, so going a bit extreme on the security side isn't going to hurt anybody.
"> A riddle still let's someone solve it.

In theory, but you could design it so that the person would have to know you very closely and spend a lot of time doing so, it's more secure than saving a 20char password because you might forget it. Store the riddle where you would store the password and you've increased security. 

It's quite easy to set up what you proposed on ethereum but I'm not familiar enough with nTimeLock to comment on that. You could always have that as a backup. 

As a developer, I plan on doing lots of fun things to give friends/family access in case something happens to me."

"So for a lot of things if you compile the software from source the binary is not byte for byte identical to what ever binary a vendor may release. 

A deterministic build means that you can compile the software from source and it's constructed in such a way that  then you'll get the same binary that the vendor distributes. So this way when Trezor releases a firmware upgrade you can verify that the firmware you are installing is in fact built from the same source code that they claim it is. This way you can prove that there's no hidden surprises in the binary."
"What is true is that most bitcoiners do not know what the word ""like"" means, so they cannot tell the difference between ""bitcoin is a Ponzi"" and ""[investing in bitcoin is stupid, LIKE investing in a Ponzi](https://www.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/576fb3/sec_issues_historic_decision_on_the_coin_etf_fund/d8pr4ig/)"".

I stand corrected, thank you for this information! Maybe they could use a blockchain solution in the future? I know theres progress being made on that front
a fool and his money are soon parted. its always been true and thats the same thing with crypto.  solving math problems as money is a stupid idea, but thats not going to stop some poor people from getting rich, and alot of already rich people from talking alot of poorer peoples money.  wooowwee.  free market baby.  time to crush the poor.

Well yeah. What I meant is do any consumer  hardware wallets support it already?
I bought it before buying any coin, because I didn't know better at that time. haha Moved a small qty of btc to it to test it and I freaked out at the transaction cost. That was in October btw. Did my research, because no way a system with fees in dollar and not cent would work. Been with BCH since mid-october.

It's not enough to conclude anything when dealing with hardware you didn't build yourself which is the important part of the question.
"Of course! That only needs a firmware upgrade to support it. 

"
Lmao a $100 ledger to store $150 of btc. I dig it. 
"Who cares if the email gets hacked? The private key is encrypted, the password is in your head. 

I put my keys in Keepass databases with a few millions of rounds of hashing to make the bruteforce impossible.

I then email the Keepass database to my second email, my family, I upload it to my server, and to my cloud storage."
If you're looking for a basic *tradeoff*, this triangle property is the best I've come across: Confidentiality, integrity, availability.
That made no sense.
1 just back up your seed securely 
The good thing about being really retarded is that one doesn't even realize that one is.
"I would personally be very happy with 2, just in case something unthinkable happens with one. 

Perhaps grab a new one at whatever milestone you feel deserves it?"
It's still better than the alternative. 
Interesting take, multi-sig with multiple hardware wallets. Can this be done?
Yes, they haven't hack my 0.01 btc soo far hehe. 
"I encrypt the paper wallet and write down the passphrase for a trusted family member. I actually do store the encrypted wallet itself on cloud storage, but first burn it within an encrypted disk image. I know people will say ""never store it in cloud storage"". But I think the risk of this double encryption being broken is far smaller than me losing the paper wallet or my hard drive breaking."
"I think everyone your family is much more likely to have one of them have their email hacked, than it is likely someone breaks into your house and steals your paper wallet. Or your only copy burns down. Or you forget about it so long that it fades away. Or that someone maliciously pushed “print another copy” immediately after you printed that out. 

You can come up with any fault in a paper wallet. If handled responsibly, it is infinitely more secure than emailing your code to your family or leaving it stored in cloud storage. It may not be easier. But infinitely more secure. "
I don't think securing your keys by distributing printed copies to people is a fantastic idea.
"> Except the basic principle of security is that nothing is 100% safe.

It's not a ""basic principle"". Maybe an ""inherent property""?"
"Unless it's insured.

Like a bank.

But we don't like to say that ;) "
Yeah, personally I'll trust what works for cryptocurrency itself - encryption. It's not safe either, but at least it lets you keep backups and requires a pass phrase to get at. KeepassXC being my choice for encrypting passwords, private keys and the like.
"Just make sure to give the second copy to a neighbor.  

/s"
Any reason why cardano can’t be save on a paperwallet.
That's not what he meant. He meant you'd have to be brave to buy from ebay to get the product faster and then trust that changing the seed is enough and there isn't more fuckery a'foot.

"I am not sure what is your point... but, indeed, even if bitcoin were to replace national currencies,  banks would continue to exist, because their main service -- lending -- would still be as necessary as it is now; and people would entrust their bitcoins to banks, to be lent to other parties, for a variety of reasons.

Note that 99.99% of the payments in the world do not need the ""trustless"" feature of bitcoin.  Most people have no qualms about trusting banks (and even the government) to keep their money and intermediate their payments.  And most people accept virtual dollars -- that are only entries in a bank's ledger -- as having the same value as cash."

omg.  stay with me!  economies need loans to function.  these crypto holding places could then LOAN some of that stored money out to people!  OH YEA!  AND we can build like a ... qualification system that tells the crypto vaults who to loan money to!  like a score sheet on each person on how good they are at paying stuff!  OMFG!!!!!!

"A daily scan won't prevent you from getting pwned. By the time you catch it, the damage has likely been done. Use a good firewall, if you're on Windows then use MSE/Defender in active mode. 

Of course none of this matters because your wallet should be in cold storage and money should only be transferred to your hot wallet located on your computer as needed, or even better, just sign your transactions on the cold machine and move the signed transactions to the hot machine so they can propagate to the network."
"""I bought a trezor hardware wallet back in the day. (edit: I was one of the last users to pay 1btc for it. It was a couple hundred dollars then.) I had issues with it not wanting to talk to my PC every third time I plugged it in.""

"Depending on the value, I wouldn't worry about destroying the computer. Just take reasonable steps to erase it and secure it from being accessed or networked.

Also, I would totally do some dry runs. Get comfortable with the process using small amounts. Checking that I can withdraw the funds. "
The Ledger is from France. If you ordered it on Amazon, you bought it from a third party seller.
Amazon.jp has trezor? I live in Japan now. Got a reliable link? 
"Their website claims it is on pre order and won't be available until March 20th.

Snap, worth paying the extra for. 2nd one took 2 days
Yeah except they won't ship it ever. I ordered one a month ago and finally cancelled it today. They only responded after I went through PayPal. Terrible customer service from ledger
Yep me too straight from Trezor website. Paid with bitcoin. All the way to Nz in less than a week. 
I will try this when I get mine. In every case investors should test it first. Small loseable amount. Test it's security when you trust it, add the bulk. I test exchanges with small amount first before sending anything over $100.
Indeed. If you don't act like a retard on the internet or maybe use a virtual machine that you only use for your coin then your paper wallets are OK
And get Mtgoxed?
It is easy to screw up a paperwallet also.
"> Or use a paper wallet

Do you think a user that falls for ""pre-installed seed"" can be trusted to securely create and use a  paper wallet?

That's not a solution.
"
Can most of the top 100 altcoins be stored on a paper wallet?
"Or have a basic understanding that hardware wallets don’t come with a pre-generated seed and know that seeds can be recreated over and over. 

Education is the issue here. There are all kinds of scams that can happen with paper wallets — or any kind of wallet for that matter. "
Wow, u/asickshack tipped him 100 usd. That's awesome!
"As we've just seen, even companies like Intel with literally billions of dollars of R&D budget can screw up.

Don't tell me that the wallet manufacturers, who in most cases use general-purpose computing hardware that's not designed to handle sensitive things like keys, don't screw up their security.

(Although some vendors seem better than others, and do appear to use decent chips.)"
"If Amazon does commingling, it doesn't matter from whom you buy. They get 50 items themselves, 20 items each from two honest third party sellers, and 10 from a scammer. They have the same bar code and look the same, so Amazon just dumps them all into one big bin. Now whether you order from Amazon, the honest sellers, or the scammer, you have a 10% chance to get the scammer's product and neither you nor Amazon will even know whom to blame.

Maybe they're smart and don't do commingling for Ledgers, but I doubt it. For them, it's just a piece of electronics, just like a  gaming mouse, not something that can cost the buyer tens of thousands if misshipped."
"> Only get one directly from the manufacturer

Better make sure that you are at the real vendors website and not a phishing site that will still mail you junk.  Even if it is the vendors website, it could be hacked and you'll still get mailed junk (if you get anything at all).  Check the SSL certificate, but if you have malware those can't even be trusted because the malware could have added new certificate authorities and created fake SSL certificates.

Honestly, the only real way to use a hardware wallet is to build it yourself, but even then you have to choose hardware suppliers you trust.  One jacked up counterfeit microcontroller and poof, you can kiss your Bitcoin goodbye.  Worse, I've read stories about the compilers adding stuff that steals your bitcoin...  which is why I only write in assembly for my hardware wallet."
I don’t think you are understanding the attack vector. If I were to create a version of firmware that upon startup creates the same key each time, and then gained access to a delivery of a ledger or  sold them my self. What in the ledger is stopping this vector from happening.

"**Hatton Garden safe deposit burglary**

In April 2015, the Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Company, an underground safe deposit facility in London's Hatton Garden area, was burgled. The total stolen may have a value of up to £200 million, the incident has been called the ""largest burglary in English legal history.""

The heist was planned and carried out by four elderly men who were experienced thieves, all of whom pleaded guilty and received prison sentences in March 2016. Four other men were also tried on suspicion of involvement; three were found guilty and sent to prison, while the fourth was cleared.

"Paper wallets come with their own issues. First of all, they're fragile. If you use an inkjet printer or something, they can fade or take moisture damage. You have to store them securely - and no, your desk drawer isn't secure. If your house burns down, congrats, you lost all your crypto. You can literally have the house robbed and lose it that way. The list goes on.

Is there any reason you can't print 100 pieces of paper?
Yes
A private key is just a list of ones and zeros. That doesn't change with any coin or any practical encryption scheme. It's all convertible to QR codes or text.

"All valid points (although I am quite shocked to learn that there are compilers out there that can steal your bitcoin. I'll Google that later).

Maybe buy a hardware wallet from the (real) manufacturer (do all the checks). And then not use it for a few years. Only if there are no reports of theft, then use it. No not convenient at all, but might not be a bad idea if you want to be extra careful."
"I was having same concern but it’s not possible. When you want to install a wallet to your Ledger device there’s a cryptography in between you and ledger servers. Meaning fake firmware would not have a correct key so the installation fails

"A riddle still let's someone solve it. The best way would be to set up an nTimeLock contract. You could for example give people you trust an unencrypted Bitcoin wallet with no BTC on it but have your own BTC wallet with a password only you know and then have a nTimeLock contract to say send all those Bitcoin after 10 years to the unencrypted one unless the contract is canceled. This way you don't need to trust anyone with the funds but if you die well in 10 years your family gets the money.

But that's probably a little complicated to set up. "
Its actually the same problem with the Social Security program in the US. Its clearly and seriously flawed, and needs personal accounts that politicians can't raid without being caught, and to realize long term gains of investing in stocks, but 70 % of the people have no problem with the 100% lootable no-growth system, so the rest of us with brains are stuck in the system as it is. its the same with the Evil Banks we have now. I'm 100 % for a trustworthy crypto bank, that actually does the security job without the BS that Wall Street is famous for, but who will build that bank ? Evil Bankers ? I think not. Here's a thought, why not have legalized Pot growers make new banks ? They have the money now, and I'd trust them 1000% more than Wall Street.

"Of course you were right. I'd not trust hardware wallets unless they come in sealed packaging and the manufacturer put the package in my hands themselves. Even then I'd have doubts.

Also paper wallets printed on any network connected printer can't be trusted. I've updated firmware on printers, you just print the binary to the printer and it updates. That binary could contain anything."
for that sort of money you will have to expect that fake devices are coming.
+1.  Excellent post.  
Thank you for taking action to make future attacks less likely to succeed.
Thank you for your follow up. Was doubting between Ledger or Trezor but this kind of prompt response made me go with Ledger!
Your company should list the names of Authorized Resellers (including eBay sellers and stores) on your website. I have seen more than one eBay seller claiming to be an Authorized Reseller. 
"Maybe also produce a youtube video & article, ""Welcome to Ledger. How to avoid common scams"".  And whenever someone changes the PIN, recommend that they watch that video, or read the article."
"Let me get this straight.

It's almost like a hardware wallet will be like building your own lightsaber. Until you can master the crypto-arts will you have the knowledge to build your own secure device. Only then can you trust the hardware wallet.

Shit, got to feel sorry for the guy.
I sold hardware wallets on ebay and Amazon for a bit, and nobody wanted them for this very reason. 
He didn't get scammed - he failed at security best practices.
The Ledger Nano was not hacked simply the seller configured the nano prior too and printed a set private key for the user to use. Leaving him the ability to recover said key on another nano and move his coins. Crafty but the device was not hacked. The process was and the user did not read enough into the site to know when you purchase a nano the key is created by you and you fill in the empty recovery sheet. The nano has attestation and detects if its been altered https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tjKjLkRzyU Since the device was not altered but the process was noway of the buyer knowing unless he read the site and what the process was and question the fact he had a premade key in his hands.
"I disagree that having an ""anti tamper seal"" wouldn't do much.  An anti tamper seal would be one more barrier that the attacker has to overcome, and I don't think this would be trivial."
How do offline wallets work? Are hardware wallets still the best option for my bch?
The best part is that the device itself *probably* isn’t even compromised. It’s just set up with the compromised seed.
"Yeah. I made a post about how I think these over-priced devices are stupid anyway, and people didn't like that.

But I agree with you. If trying to save $50 for securing $34,000.... You're pretty foolish"

I wonder if it's possible to back track to the guy who sent it to him."
Hate to say it but you're absolutely right. RIP
 if you're keeping your life savings in crypto then you probably know nothing about crypto really

Both Ledger and Trezor should not authorize any third party sellers, and should warn customers not to buy from third parties.

I think this just proves that most people aren’t fit to own crypto currency, it’s rather technical and requires a fair bit of research and knowledge on how it works to keep it safe. The paper that came with it should have been a red flag."

Okay but you have to be registered to sell on eBay. How does this not qualify as something the seller can be arrested for? All his info is on there.

Man, ignorance can really cost.
That sucks,  I bet the scammer was smart and bought the ledger from a reputable source.
I know barely anything about hardware wallets (because I don't own any). Is there a way he could have avoided this while still buying from that seller? What I mean is if there is a way to reset any hardware wallet to be extra sure that this cannot happen.

Two things. Don't buy hardware wallets from eBay, don't put life savings in crypto. Hard lesson to learn but there ya go
Many thanks for a lot of your kind words, it means a lot to me. I got scam because of the seed recover card that had been put there here is a pic (https://imgur.com/DsICkge), it had a scratch off panel and look to me very legit, I really thought it was a new security thing from Ledger.  I just want to make it clear, the money I lost was around £25000 - £26000, it is not all of my life savings, but it is a lot of money to me to the point it will take me years to recover and has really damaged my life. If I had lost the money due to the value of the coins dropping in value that would have been my own fault and I would have accepted it, but someone scamming all the money from me, that is very hard to accept.
OMG - the hw wallet was not compromised...it came with the 24-word passphrase...wow! This user would have lost his coins a million different ways if not for this scam.  The user simply didn't know what he was doing, like at all!
"Lesson - buy your security hardware from reputable sources.

eBay is not a reputable source.
The manufacturer is."
"Holy shit. This is a new one.

The hardware isn't compromised right? Just the pre-made seed words which someone else had a copy of."
"There are a multitude of ways to get scammed. And a hardware wallet ain't much good if your house burns down when your backup is in your house too. What you need is a set of personal protocols that cover all aspects of security, addressing things like: how do you routinely access your crypto?; don't store everything in one place / wallet; have backups that are secure but not susceptible to single point failure (i.e. house burning down); have periodic reviews - is your wallet / method up-to-date and still robust?; and don't make anything more complicated than needs be so you screw yourself over by losing / forgetting something.
"
"To people who don’t know the Ledger Nano S was not tampered with. The scammer just gave his seed to the user, who then deposited their funds in the address with that seed. What this means is that both the scammer and the guy have access to the wallet. 

I would also like to mention if your going to end up storing tens of thousands you might as well spend the extra $ and buy the wallet from the official website. "
I warned against buying hardware wallets from third parties as soon as the Trezor came out.  I was booed as a FUD-monger, of course.

what the!
"Can I just be honest? I feel for this person, but you get what you pay for. I can guess this person was trying to get out of paying full price for the device.

The site warns you not to buy from resellers (at least Trezor did.) Someone who is not willing to pay full price for the real device from the real manufacturer or their own trusted seller is foolish.

The Ledger app though wouldn't work with a counterfeit Ledger though. So I'm assuming this guy bought a legit Ledger and the seller already configured it to that seed and out in a fake set of documentation. If you do buy a second hand Leger you go into settings and factory reset it so that you have your own random seed. "
I can't imagine why someone with 34k would go cheap on a $200 piece of secuirty for that 34k and buy used. Why oh why.

That's just stupid. I'm sorry. And investing all his life's savings is just a sign he couldn't get enough. 
Sucks man. The guy basically ended up paying some scammer to rob him blind.

Thought one of the upsides of crypto was how secure it was how is this possible? Sorry for the person who lost so much.. 
Seriously that sucks but why the hell would you buy that off eBay
The lesson here is that hardware providers must provide online PDFs of the full instructions with digital signatures.
"Yes, you can go into settings and factory reset it.  Then when you start it up it generates a random seed and tells you to write it down. In fact when you buy a Ledger from them that's how it's configured (rather it's not) and isn't set up with any existing seed but asks you to generate one just the same as factory resetting it.

Never put your funds in a wallet someone else generated for you, you always generate your own otherwise that person stands to have a copy of the seed."

Yeo, Cardinal rule of investing is don't put in more than you can lose. But I mean clearly this guy wasn't the sharpest pencil in the box in the first place

Yes, probably, because ledger has a tampering test, if the hardware gets adulterated it won't work with their chrome wallets.
mini fireproof safes
Can you expand on this? What exactly happened? 
"Fireproof safe should be good.  Also you could laminate your paper wallets for extra protection, or at a bare minimum keep them inside sealed zip-lock bags.

Another option if you have large savings would be a safe-deposit box at a local bank. "
"And the user was ill-informed enough not to realize how sketchy that would be even if it cam directly from Ledger as any pre-generated seed is not secure.

I'm pretty sure the Ledger Chrome app would refuse to work with a modified or counterfeit Ledger. Unless the user is gullible enough not to download the actual app and fallow some set of instructions to download a fake one from some specified URL. "
yeah, the guy did zero research on HW wallets. shame, but his own fault only.
"> This is awful to see but is it actually that bad to buy one from a third party?

It's probably ok to buy directly from major 3rd party retailers (Walmart.com, Amazon.com), but not from independent sellers like ""Joe-Discount-Wallets"" who sell on Amazon.

But even when people try to go to the official website, they can get scammed.

Exodus.io has a great multi-currency software wallet.

Earlier this year, a scammer had setup ExodusWallet.io to scam people.  And for a while, Google actually let him place ads leading to his scam website.  So some careless people searched for Exodus wallet, accidentally clicked on the scam Google ad, and got sent to a realistic mirror scam website.

Yes, these things happen.  My mom once clicked on a Google ad, without realizing that it was an ad.

> Isn't this his fault for not performing the basic verification before putting anything onto it?

He followed the instructions that came in the sealed box. Unfortunately, they were scam instructions. 

"
Also instructions were not read. When you start setting up your wallet online it fucking tells you to never use a system which seed you did not create. Aaaaand then he clicked ok and proceeded to do just that.

Yep, that's why Coinbase exists (and banks for that matter). For a lot of people they aren't responsible enough to hold their own money and instead need a professional to do it for them.
Or you know a lot about crypto and have been in it for years. 80% of my life savings are in cypto. That's not because I put my life savings into crypto. That's because my crypto grew into my life savings over the years.
"To be fair, I converted a third of life savings + some monthly spare which was not much anyway but now crypto  constitutes 70% because I'm not cashing out. In 6 months it can be 90% at which point I can call it my whole life savings for practical reasons.

I still keep paying to my personal retirement fund but it cannot keep up."
You don't save $34,000 by paying retail prices for things.
"To be fair, I only put in a couple thousand dollars, most certainly not my life savings. By the time I cashed out after 3+ years of hodl, though, it was a bit more than my traditional life savings funds (hooray, sick gains).

Edit: of course, I used paper wallets, so...."
"It's unbelievable that there are people downvoting this. This is basics 101.

I feel for the guy, don't get me wrong..."
Sounds like the issue was he used the private keys the seller provided instead of generating a new wallet with the device itself.
You could use the tip bot on his post.
That's really nice of you.
Cryptocurrency is very complicated, especially for new people.  When you find a source of information ... you read a bit more and find people saying that that information is wrong.  I took two (2) or more weeks of obsessive reading, and reconsidering before I bought anything ... and then changed my mind about wallets and was penalized when it was btc I was dealing with.
"At some point you will want to sell or spend your coins.  If the computer that you use to sign transactions is connected to the internet and has malware in it, your bitcoins can be stolen.  So you must sign your transactions on a separate computer, never connected to the internet; and then transfer the signed transactions to your normal computer with a pen drive or some other non-internet medium.

Even then you must watch out.  Malware on that ""air-gapped"" computer could leak the private key in the signed transaction.  Or, if you use that computer to create your key/address pairs, the malware might tamper with the random number generator to produce keys that are easy to guess.

A hardware wallet basically replaces that second computer.  Since it runs only one piece of software (the firmware), it is less likely to have malware.  (But not impossible.  The manufacturer or someone in the shipping chain could replace the hardware and/or firmware with a malicious version.)"
Yeah, he could have avoided this simply by just following original instructions from the manufacturers website.
"There is a possibility that your PC is compromised without you knowing and you could have your private key stolen at the moment when you copy the key/seed to your offline paper.

With a hardware wallet the private key and a 24 word recovery seed is generated and displayed on the device and never leaves it.

You still need to write down the 24 word recovery seed and store it securely. The recovery seed is more important than the HW wallet."
"> don’t just use an offline paper wallet and just laminate that shit and keep it in a fireproof safe box?

At least from my point of view that's a lot more hassle and inconvenience than a hw wallet.

The problem right now is supply from the manufacturer, They can’t keep enough in stock, at least, last time I looked this was the case. I ordered my trezor directly from trezor, and the box/unit had factory tamperproof seals. I imagine ledger’s packaging is configured similarly. But of course, people stupid enough to fall for using a pregenerated seed aren’t going to check for that stuff.

Or, you could just buy from the ledger site and not have to worry about that at all. Buying from ebay to save a few dollars on something that can store your wealth is not very smart. If they are out of stock just submit your order and wait and in the meantime use tails os or something that is at least somewhat secure.

"I'd say that technically, through ignorance, this guy gave his money to someone else's address. It's hard for me to see this as theft when the ""thief"" didn't take anything, just waited for someone to make the ignorant mistake of sending their wallet money."
Look to be fair the ledger was fine. It was user error here. 
Can't but ledger nano right now, no stock.
I have $34000 in the bank and buy phones/laptops off eBay. People get in that mindset pretty easily 
Still don’t buy it. They were tech savvy enough to buy crypto and suddenly not tech savvy enough to buy the correct wallet? Nope. 
Yeah, I've bought & sold electronics on ebay & amazon before.  I would like to think I wouldn't make this kind of mistake with a crypto hardware wallet.  But when I look back on my life, I have made some really boneheaded mistakes before.
"> People get in that mindset pretty easily 

Yes, but you're not supposed to be securing $34K on a phone or computer bought off EBay!! Not unless you reformat and re-install the OS with a known good source. People need to seriously change their mindset. This isn't just about cryptocurrency either. Money has been going digital for a while now and there have been billions of dollars in scams, card fraud, identity theft etc over the years. With cryptocurrency we actually have a chance to make things more secure than previously imagined but it also takes shifting how people think about their decision making securing digital money."
"Secondhand info: ""Buy a hardware wallet, like a Ledger, for ultimate security."" ""Oh look, they have them on Ebay."""

"There's a lot of newbies getting involved with crypto, and the current advice floating around is that hardware wallets are the safest way to go.

Personally, I can see newbies, who aren't tech-savvy, getting nailed by the scam.

I mean, there are a lot of idiots who buy gold bullion on ebay, it comes in sealed packaging so they don't weigh/measure it, and years later they try to sell it at a coin shop and it turns out to be fake.

"
"Some possibilities:

a) The seller was a hijacked ebay account, that was traded between hackers on the dark web.

b) The seller was semi-legit, maybe operating as a pawn shop or wholesale liquidator, and they bought a pallet of electronics from a store that was going out of business.  50% off.  Unfortunately, the compromised Ledger Nano wallets were mixed in there."
Not his anymore
"Is there a better place to keep it? Jaxx wallet for example has had issues reported about it in the news, etc. All wallets have issues. So far Hardware wallets seem to be the safest. 

Only thing he did wrong was getting it from a third party."
second question. why would you invest your life savings into cryptocurrency?
"My life savings is more than $30k and it's on a Ledger. I'm not that old and crypto has pretty much been the only savings I've ever known which is the reason why I have over $50k worth of it. 

Edit: Being patient and investing since the age of 17 pays off"
"Yup. Seen it on a couple but it's going to happen again and again. Tbf to Ledger they've reached out to OP too which is good to see. What they can do is another question.

Awful, awful bastards out there."
"I think *everyone* (or at least any rational person) would agree one should *not* put their life's savings into crypto-currency.  Even the most bullish among us would caution new users against doing that.  Most advice I have seen on the main bitcoin sub-reddits has been to only invest what you can afford to lose, and to dollar-cost average, or make small, regular monthly investments into currencies you think have a strong long-term outlook.  

Honestly I hear some stories of people taking out loans or going ""all-in"" with their savings, and most of those stories I do not even find credible.  I am very bullish on several of the major digital currencies, yet I would never put any significant amount of savings at any one time into these investments, and I have not seen other redditors recommending to newcomers to do anything like that."
They are out of stock currently from the source.
Holy shit. Who would support that financially. 
For now, in time we will see fake Ledgers being sold.  If they can copy iPhones, why not?
There's also a reset device option.. but yeah sure that works too. 
">But I agree with you. If trying to save $50 for securing $34,000.... You're pretty foolish

How would you protect 34k then?

(Serious question."
Fine as in not tampered with? Was that the case here? Thanks by the way!
This is why I don't use hardware wallets. 3 times and you're wealth is destroyed.
I'd recommend splitting it up onto multiple addresses/ledgers. Just in case.

Read your shit people! Or you’ll learn the hard and expensive way how you need to be sure that your private key is YOUR private key and not in someway compromised. "
"No, not possible on the ledger. Every time you start it up it checks the hardware and the software. There’s some cryptographic magic baked into the chip, so that if any hardware is changed, or any software, the device will not work. 

The checksum has to be perfect otherwise the device won’t work. "

not likely, ebay is full of scammers
A bank.
It was sold as new.
"The problem with paper wallets isn't when they're dormant, its when you try to use them.

You need to enter the seed onto some device when you want to use it, and that's where the risk lies for most people."
I tend to disagree. Scammers are educating people the hard way. Some people aren't able to learn any other way
Soon is now.
It's bip38 encrypted, your funds are safe as long as your password is secure, you probably need to send the guy your private and public key before he sends you the card.
The seed word should be generated when you activate it. The seller on eBay basically sent him an empty wallet which the guy filled with his money. 
I thnk it is insane to put ANY money in cryptocrrency.  But some ways are insaner than others...
The logic of this sub is appalling. 
Since you paid via Paypal, you should definitely get in touch with them as the scammer used their service to steal from you. Not saying you will get that money back, but it's definitely worth talking to them about as they have some level of protection/insurance against fraud. Good luck buddy.

There are just tons of examples of how updates and software installed could compromise the system.

Add to that, that most people are in Admin mode on their PC's and there you go."
Thanks so much. 
Ledger could ask a simple question the first time you install the software “is this the first time you are using this device?” If they answer yes it should raise all hell if it is already configured. Or ask more questions to verify it was correctly setup and not from an external seed. 
Has there been any know exploits or tampering with ledgers?
I know Ledger has some fancy anti-tampering things, and I'm pretty sure I wouldn't fall for a low-tech scam like this, but for peace of mind I just bought mine directly off their website.
You don't know it wasn't tampered with. Probably it wasn't because the paper card was easier to do. But it could have been tampered with and you wouldn't know.

People should understand that that really only indicates that someone has a shrink-wrap machine. Many businesses will shrink-wrap returned goods to present them as new.
because they are open source and their entire business depends on delivering ONE thing: security.  but yes, nothing is perfect.  I think it's far more risky and likely that your seed word might burn down in a fire, or be found by a snooping smart maid, etc, than there being some sort of bug maliciously planted in a bunch of trezors.
well, amazon's partners are basically who?  individual vendors.  some might be people running business out of their homes.  one might turn out to be an evil scammer right?  
"They're all secure from a hardware standpoint... the problem wasn't the third party buy or even technically device itself.  It was the scam seed card and already setup device.

Ledger's aren't supposed to have pre-set keys.  The Key generation is part of the initial setup process.  Anyone buying from a  third party can avoid this scam and still use the device if they reset the hardware wallet and create new keys from scratch that only they have.  That's the true lesson here.  Even if you get yours straight from Ledger, I'd reset it blank with new Keys. "

ebay has a contact field you can click on, and I might go to police before I contacted the seller see what they say....maybe just call police and ask there advice first.
Police aint gonna do anything
But don't you already have a Ledger? Just restart and let it choose the words for you instead of restoring from the fraudulent restore seed.
This. Someone could have bought, tampered with and returned the item. Seller assumes unopened, puts back for resale. 
"Plus ebay accounts are disposable. Minimum ID needed to set one up. They only really care if you start to withdraw cash and not all that much even then. I set up an online shop and created a paypal account about 10 weeks ago. Easy.

If the scammer doesn't want to be caught then they hid their IP and never withdrew the money. Loss more than covered by the later fraud.

It's worth trying. Just not very likely to yield results if the scammer thought things through."
I know I am preparing for the fact that i will never see my money again and that is what makes me very depressed.

Crypto isn’t enforced by the law

What kind of a silly question is this?
"Selling a device as new, but with compromised security for the seller to later exploit, is certainly illegal.

I can't sell you a door (or the lock) but keep a copy of the key to then break into your house. That's illegal as fuck, even if all I do is open the door and then close it."
can try with BCH or LTC
I actually sold on eBay for a few years and like 90-95% of the time they would side with the customer. I remember one case where the customer claimed they never received an item even though the tracking number verified they did (into a locked mailbox). Still had to refund them. OP might have a chance!

True.  But let's say you advise a cheap ass friend (i have several) to buy a ledger for example.  Then being cheap they go on eBay to save a few bucks because to them the 100$ price tag is too high.  You can see how the naive could fall for this and I feel for the guy.  Many of us take for granted being super secure about our crypto and even then sweat it making transfers etc.  The average joe new to crypto is probably not going to review best practices and thoroughly review exactly how the device works before simply reading the enclosed instructions and proceeding to use.  Theoretically this same scam could also be run from an amazon retailer/partner (i could be wrong).   
"Exactly, spot on. Tired of reading the same criticisms of third party vendors when that is not actually the problem here. The reality is that *most* people buy from third parties.

"Definitely not a slam dunk prosecution, but often criminals make mistakes. Hopefully, the investigators will be relatively experienced in sniffing out any missteps.  

And there's a small chance the eBay seller really is innocent, but then they'd be the most important witness for tracking the actual source."
Keep us updated!
Yea seriously.  Hey uhh /u/moodyrocket all my wallets just disappeared too!  with all my money!  omg!  someone please pay me back!  I had uhhhh $250,000 in there!  so uhh Mr. Policeman can i uhhh like uhhh get that money back please and thank you.
"Op isn't the only one that's been ""targeted"" with this scam, I'd be willing to bet that the other people with that same scam card inside bought it from the same ebay user."
If the scammer is smart, he won't get caught. but that's not always the case. sometimes they do something stupid that provides proof.
"Police subpoenas PayPal. PayPal tells police the names and addresses of other potential victims. Police asks other victims, recovers identical fake seed card, with fingerprints of scammer in one case.

Judge is convinced, beyond *reasonable* doubt, that the seed cards didn't make it into the sealed packages out of the scammers desire to help his customers simplify their setup. Judge sends scammer to jail.

Scammer doesn't reveal where he hid the coins, so he spends 4 instead of 2 years in jail, and has a civil judgement (preponderance of evidence, so really easy) against him to repay (but doesn't officially have any money so people don't get their money back, although he mysteriously seems be able to support a serious partying habit despite having no job where his wages could be garnished).

One night, a masked person knocks on the scammers door, pushes the scammer inside once he opens, and retrieves the location and credentials of the coins, now worth millions, using a rubber hose and a $5 wrench. The scammer realizes that this was a bad idea.

Edit: since Mr. Rubber Hose isn't happy with the amount discovered, he continues the extraction process. The scammer realizes that this was a really bad idea, because although he has already given up everything, the masked maniac isn't going to believe him and is picking up the wrench again.

In the next episode of Murder Mystery: was it one of the victims, a jailmate listening to the scammer's bragging while drunk on prison toilet wine, or an unrelated person who heard about the case and decided to get at the scammer's riches? And what happened with the scammer? Will police find his mangled body in the woods, or is he still alive, somewhere in a basement, being fed bread and water and asked a simple, yet impossible question every day, tied to a pipe and beaten with another?

Of course, this is just one possible outcome. Maybe the scammer will turn themselves in, maybe they'll confess when police comes knocking, maybe they'll return the coins hoping to reduce the eagerness of the prosecution to avoid getting caught, maybe they'll get away with it, brag, then end up in the basement tied to a pipe, maybe they'll return the coins when caught to get a milder sentence (and avoid the rubber hose), ...

Most criminals think they're smart and that they thought of everything. Almost all of them are wrong, but some get lucky that the police gets bored/too busy with other stuff before finding the mistakes they made. Given how much stuff was involved here (eBay, PayPal, postal shipping, physical items, producing fake scratch cards - is that [color](https://www.google.com/search?q=color+printer+yellow+dots) in the logo?) it'd take a damn careful criminal to cover all their tracks. Most criminals aren't that smart."
"You are assuming the seller made the swap. The seller could be a drop shipper or someone who just buys on asian import sites and resells.

This is how many of the fake usb sticks were sold.  Morons reselling from shady websites.  You contact them and they don't even understand what a usb stick is and want to send a replacement as a fix. Naturally the replacement is also a scam.  Eventually all you can do is file a claim with ebay/paypal.  It solves little because resellers are a dime a dozen.  If ebay removes one, another one just gets bumped up on the search list.

Ledger being involved means at least they can pursue the source of the reseller, but odds are these guys who lost their money aren't getting it back because the seller has no idea what the product they resold even is."
how do you know the seller is culpable ?
They may not be. If they are rpofessional crimanls, they will have used false identies. Furthermore, even if they were somehow identifiable, proving that this has happened could be very difficult.
Good hunting. I hope you're able to recover all of your coins.
"You're probably going to get your hopes up but I'd definitely be careful of that. It's very likely nothing tangible will come of this and you'll still be out the btc.

Good luck though."
What makes this nuts, is that it's the scammer that has been incredibly stupid. There's no way he can get away with this if he lives in the uk.
An interesting point. I wonder if this will require that law enforcement finds the private keys in the possession of the suspect to get a successful prosecution?
"There is no proof the seller altered the device. Possibly he brought a batch for a good price from an anonymous seller.

In all likelihood the police Willbe more interested in going after the person reporting the crime. It's far easier for them."
[removed]
"Well yea if the police finds evidence (private key, counterfeit ledger card etc..) it is game over for the scammer but for this you still have to manage to have police raids the suspect house, this takes weeks / months. If the scammer is smart he wont anything incriminating in his house if he is not then ... 
"
For sure, but again if you know what you're doing this shouldn't be an issue.  I feel like the risk is really low and if you're that worried you can reflash the firmware yourself before using it.
that attack is not possible due to the secure element chip.  same chip as used in smart bank cards.
"$15 to send $10,000...

TIL 0.15% is a high fee. "
Depends how things are set up. It might automatically sweep the address(es), particularly if it's reusing keys. But if that's a concern, throw whatever you feel is sufficient on there, just not your whole stash first go.
"Someone could make a fake ledger and sell it on ebay that looks just like the real thing but it's programmed to make a wallet with a known seed to the attacker.   The guy that got OP apparently used a real ledger and just pre-setup the wallet and gave him the seed with a scratch off film on it to fool him...but a fake piece of hardware could fool a lot of people too.

Too many uninformed people trying to get into crypyo.  Wouldn't be surprised if someone just decided to write ""Ledger"" on a plain USB thumb drive and sell it on Ebay. And it has a text file with a QR code that said ""This is your wallet.  Send your bitcoins here""...Someone would fall for that.  "
"~~4 weeks of what? The timer doesn't start until you send the test funds.~~

You might want to look into the way Amazon pools stock from different sellers. Just because you brought the item from a trusted seller doesn't mean Amazon didn't swap it with an item from a different seller that they believed was identical.
"It could be a real untampered Ledger ""wrapped"" in a ""man-in-the-middle device"". Everything is the same but when you choose to initialized the device, it simulates entering a pre-defined backup phrase and overrides the display to show the initialization sequences instead. It would be a lot harder to do but it would be impossible to detect from the outside."
"Normally the ledger would generate a new set of seed words when you first boot it up - this means the normal operation of the device requires trusting that the device is not just pretending to give you a new, random set of seed words...right?

How can you generate seed words yourself?"
Thanks so much
I would imagine it's the same for you, just a recommendation though!
[deleted]
"Now that’s an interesting concept.  I’m not sure what the attack vector would be for this hack, since it sounds to me to be a layer on top of the incorruptible Ledger code.  I don’t believe it could insert or modify a sending address or amount, nor access any secure keys, but it could indeed capture a pin.

I guess it could read the display and capture the display when the seed words are being entered or displayed.

 You make a good point, thanks for taking the time to clarify."
"I have a Ledger and I know how it works. You were clear but apparently I wasn't.

An attacker can theoretically mess with the display and buttons of the Ledger without changing the firmware or secure element. It won't change its ability to respond to challenges from the extension. It would appear like a real Ledger to the extension because it essentially is a real Ledger inside. It would only change what's displayed on the display and when buttons are pressed. The extension can't know this."
I may not have been very clear, the chrome extensions are used exclusively with the Ledger.  They’re useless unless your plugged in, pin entered.  Only a real valid Ledger will work with them.  Once you validate your ledger using a Ledger extension, you know you’re good to go with other wallets that work with Ledger (Electrum, MyEtherWallet, etc.)
I sent them a message yesterday and today and have had no response from them.
That's why you use an original Ledger to provide correct responses. The only thing you need to interfere with are the display and the buttons.
https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7ojvca/i_am_the_guy_that_lost_25000_due_to_ledger_scam/dsa5jjf/
The MITM doesn't need to be between the device and the PC. It only needs to be between the display/buttons and the user. Those connections can't be secure or you wouldn't be able to read the display or press the buttons.
All it takes is one 🖤  to give it a whole new meaning!
You also need to get in contact with law enforcement
Call the Police. They will help you
No problem, just out of interest what it the eBay seller saying? Has he been evasive or helpful 
"Theoretically, the communication between the software and the secure element could be encrypted and authenticated, so that the MitM device couldn't do anything.

Practically, I don't think this is foolproof and would recommend getting your wallet as directly from the factory as possible."
do you know how secure communication works.  when you connect to coinbase for example.  do you think it is easy to do mitm in that case?    The chrome app that runs on the PC will not work if there is a mitm between it and the secure element.
[removed]
Whatever you say man
Thanks for the link, I am waiting to speak with Ledger about it on the next course of action.
How so? The real, original, untampered secure element from the Ledger would be inside the wrapped man-in-the-middle device. It would have no idea that it's being controlled by another device.
"My bet is that all the victims who fell for this got the same scratch card and were using the same seed (scammer is not going to go to the expense of individual seeds). Funds were probably swept immediately (Edit: This was apparently not the case?). Anyone care to verify or repudiate this?

Edit: According to the post, this ledger was in use so sounds like a patient scammer. Though I'd like to see the usage pattern..."
[deleted]
[removed]
He’s right, this isn’t possible when using ledger’s chrome extension wallets.  The Ledger is signed with a factory crypto key, if the chrome extension doesn’t get that key response from the Ledger, it will display an error and will not function.  Unless the hackers had the private Ledger key, they cannot spoof it, much like how crypto currency is kept secure in the blockchain.

Ledger does a firmware check any time it launches applicatins, as far as I know tampering with the device internally will cause the applications not to work.

Good metric to judge cryptocurrency's. 
Evidence
Yes, they come shrink wrapped.
if you have a spare machine to use offline or maybe you have a link to instructions how it can be done?
"It's not a big deal. You generate the public key from the private key then you hash it and base54 encode it. But what you base54 encode is the text representation of the key hash. The math library I was using stripped leading zeroes so was generating the wrong address (It may not have been possible to send to these addresses, I never tried).
"
You should do it with everything you plan to use on it. The crooks might only be targeting BTC.
"Just send a small (but non-trivial) amount of funds and a)Make sure they are credited and b)leave them to a bit to be sure they're not removed without action on your part.

Ledger generates its random seed keys internally. If you don't like it (I'm not sure why you wouldn't) you can reset it and start again."
Send 25$ or 100$ worth of crypto to the new wallet and let it sit a week or two.  Most compromised seeds will be swept quickly.
I'm hoping the wallets do some kind of key exchange verification with the device. I had the same objection which I posted earlier but deleted it when I realized the wallet *should* be able to check.
True, however, sometimes stolen funds do not count as regular operating losses.
Thanks so much.
**If I were**
If you get it straight from Ledger, won't be pre-loaded. If it is, personally, I'd throw it in the trash.
Bitcoin can't be used for transaction under 10k without paying a good % of what you are sending.

"I'm not talking about tippr.

https://www.reddit.com/user/tabbr"
Yeah, but the security chip's interaction with the Ledger software makes it impossible to physically manipulate the wallet.  If its tampered with, it wouldn't work with the Ledger software.  That's its great strength versus the Trezor.  You just have to reset it and generate new keys. That's like saying you'd throw away your house if someone copied your keys.  Just change the locks instead.
Cold storage requires pen and paper. Look it up. 
"a) anyone who buys a ledger isnt going to store $100 or less on there; and anyone scamming a ledger would know to wait for more.

I certainly wont take the first keys offered; just in case its rigged to offer those keys plus I usually wait for words that I like to be offered."

But even if they fail to get enough evidence to prosecute, scammed victims should be able to band together for group civil action, where the legal standard to win a suit is lower. Hopefully, just eBay records and evidence/testimony provided by victims would be enough to sue successfully."
"Unless one of the cards contains his fingerprints, matches his printer or his scratch card order from an online service. Or he's caught using multiple accounts to sell (not proof, but suspicious enough to be worth digging). Or he brags about it and police finds his bragging. Or one of hundreds other was he can fuck up. Or he can't say where he got the ledgers from but he happened to order the exact number sold from the original distributor.

If they manage to get his name/address, and he did it, and police are not completely incompetent/lazy, he's done for.

If he bought them from a third party, the whole chain gets a bit longer and harder to follow, but again... If the police find said seller, and they're the ones who did it, they will almost certainly have made some mistake that makes it possible to catch them.

The more I think about it, the more I'm glad that I've decided to earn my money legally and honestly. All it takes is one mistake being both made and found."

"
"Sorry that this happened to you. For future reference, keep in mind that those words represent the private key. Since it's a private key, it's something that only you should know and you should never share with anyone else. 

I know that the device included a 'scratch off' card to make you think that the words were a secret, but that still means that someone had to input those 'scratch words' into the Ledger device. Thus, by definition the words are no longer private and are therefore useless. This principle of no one else know your seed words would apply even if you thought that Ledger themselves did this--ie. you should not trust even Ledger. So, if any hardware or software manufacturer gives you those seed words or asks you to send the words to them for 'backup' then by definition there is something wrong.

In summary, seed words should always be generated by you and you alone--not by any hardware manufacturer or any software vendor. "

Theft is theft, fraud is fraud. Doesn't matter if it is USD dogecoin or MTG cards.
I'm guessing he paid in USD via paypal, which however would be. It doesn't matter what he was buying per se, but rather how he bought it. Eitherway, IANAL but I think it would be smart to reach out to them. Doubly so if he used his VISA via paypal.
He can get a refund of $100 for the ledger, but no way is he getting $25k, it’s decentralised and sadly Paypal won’t give the guys address who robbed him. Really sad that it happened but I think the bottom line is don’t try save money on a wallet that is going to hold £25 thousand pounds, pay the money and get it from the company directly 
Yes
I bought my ledger directly from their site. Mine didn't have a scratch off.
correct, it generates new words for you upon initialization, no scratch off card or premade seed
It was an expensive lesson, but those are the ones we remember best. You'll be fine, keep your chin up.
eBay isn't going to do shit except possibly ban one disposable or hacked account and refund the cost of the ledger. Better leave this to police.
"Run a tippr service with ""bitcoin"" then. Oh wait you can't LOL"
"It could disguise a pre-initialized Ledger as an uninitialized Ledger. On first use it would guide the user through the backup procedure but instead of generating the keys like during initialization it would just display the phrase that was previously entered by the attacker.

It would be very similar to the attack that OP was hit by, but instead of using a scratch card it would be indistinguishable from a real untampered Ledger experience. Quite serious if you ask me."
"This is the best response here

The seller will be identifiable. You will not be the only one they have stolen from. The amounts involved make this a serious criminal offence. "
Yes I am waiting for Ledger to get in contact with me so a police report can be made, I am sure they have a legal rep that will help. Trust me I will do everything possible to make sure the scammer is found.
Get in touch with Elon... 
If you send me 1 btc I will help you track down your missing coins.
A lot of people are probably purchasing ledgers through ebay right now because there is a backlog on shipment until March if purchased through the ledger website.
"eBay and PayPal isn’t going to refund this guy’s lost BTC. The ebay account is either completely fake or a cheap stolen account so there’s not going to be any real seller info to track down. If the scammer was smart (and thb they seem pretty on the ball) he would wash the tokens in a couple of tumblers before moving to his own wallet so there’s no direct tracking of the coins.
It’s like getting mugged in an alley and never seeing the persons face. Report the seller to shut them down but You guys shouldn’t be getting OP’s hopes up that eBay can save him.

Edit: a word."

"Thanks for sharing your story and I am sorry this happened to you.  

If someone is using a hardware wallet and does not understand what the role of the seed is, it is very likely, unfortunately, that at some point the funds would have been lost anyways.  Example, someone taking a backup of their seed by taking a photo of it, or scanning it on an internet connected scanner.  Or recovering their wallet on a compromised computer (ie 99% of windows computers are probably compromised).  Or storing their seed in their email - there are a million scenarios to lose your coins if you dont understand what you are dealing with.

Edit: The only thing that can get OP's money back is if SOMEHOW he manages to have the police raid the scammer house asap. If the scammer is sloppy he would have incriminating stuff in his house / computer (Private keys, fake ledger card etc..). But good luck with that.

Edit: I didn't say OP is lying. It is just an example to show what the scammer's lawyer would say."

"It's worth doing a ""soak test"" with a fraction of your funds on any new wallet to be fairly sure you can be confident about it. A test spend is always a good idea too (I was messing about making paper wallets and got the algorithm for generating addresses that would be wrong on 1/100 or so wallets. Funds sent there would have been unrecoverable. Luckily I caught it early on. Needed to pad with leading zeros FWIW).

Of course, with high fees, this might look somewhat less attractive."
This really has little to do with third parties. If the op understood how the device worked he wouldn't have had an issue. This is a low tech scam that doesn't require any tampering with the device. If you know what you're doing buying from a third party is not risky at all. 
That really sucks, thanks for helping get the message out to help other people. I hope you are able to find the person that sold it and get some funds recovered. 
"I'm sorry that happened to you and it's interesting to see how quickly the rumor evolved into being your life savings. Maybe this should also be a lesson on how everything posted here should be rechecked and taken with a grain of salt. 

I call BS on people saying that they wouldn't have fallen for this scam. You never really know how you'd react, and the recovery card does look legit. I watched the setup videos on the Ledger website before I bought one, and I can't even say 100% that I wouldn't have fallen for this scam. The only thing that I'm paranoid about is who I buy from, so I waited four long months to get my Ledger from Ledger. There have been a lot of people who bought Ledgers that are legit from third party retailers, but for something that's making scammers circle like vultures, I wanted mine coming directly from the source. 

Good luck in getting your money back, although I fear it's going to be an uphill battle, and I'm guessing the scammers may be working in a different country which is going to add another level of bureaucracy. Keep us updated on any news."

im so sorry to hear this. i had a scare regarding the security of a wallet recently, and the anxiety that i felt was damn near unbearable. it will be okay, though. be strong.
Quick question. Is the ledger nano s capable of resetting your 24 words. I own 1 and before I load it up I want to know if this is an option?

I'm sorry for your loss. I hope you win a really lucky trade position that earns you back the funds.

Why is the seed preset on a piece of paper? Why isn't it generated from the device by the owner?
Man i'm so sorry to hear that. Im an online seller and I hate these people as they make us look really bad! I hope you bounce back better than before!
Thanks for sharing the story. I want to buy an hardware wallet, but the Ledger is sold out, and I was checking some on Amazon. Well, I'll just wait now! $1 /u/tippr
Omg !! So sorry to hear!! You must be absolutely mortified! :( 
I just checked ebay.co.uk and there loads of nano S for sale there,  many are double the official price, its a shame ledger cant ban the sale of these items on ebay..on the other hand if ledger out of stock until march...theres going to be a grey market
Thanks for posting this.  I bought mine from Amazon but I haven't used it yet.  I remembered there were marks and smears on the ledger itself.  I don't remember the seal though.  We're not talking about the seal on the box?  Or something within the packaging?
"That's really bad luck. Some scummy nasty people about unfortunately. It's easy to say I know but you got to try put it behind you and move on from it. 

Sorry my man :-("
Legit looking? Are you serious? It looks incredibly amateur. The company name isn't even uppercase. There's no trademarking. I'm sorry man but as they say, a fool and his money are soon parted. Hopefully you've learned your lesson.
Also the sentence at the bottom is grammatically incorrect. Should of seen the flags instantly.
"Say strong dude, hopefully the publicity from what happened makes everyone more cautious about where they get their hardware wallets from

Thanks for sharing your story to help others.
You need to file a lawsuit with the seller. If the seller cannot be found, file it against eBay and PayPal. There are things you can do to remedy the situation.

Why did you buy it from eBay?
Why not? This scam only works on people who don't understand how the device works. It wasn't tampered with and will work fine if he generates his own seed words.
"The problem is that he inserted the seed of the thief, this had nothing to do with the physical product itself.

Allegedly, ledger software checks if your physical ledger is adulterated when you start the application, like the bitcoin wallet."
At minimum be sure to report this to the police so you can at least recover some of the losses via tax return wrote offs.

"> I don’t think anyone should buy a hardware wallet from a third party.

Or even a first party for that matter. Why should HW wallet manufactures, distributers, retailers all be trusted ? "
It's £8,000 you've lost, my friend. The rest was interest. I know it was technically there, but out of your own pocket you've lost £8,000. If it's any consolation my stepbrother stung me for £3,000 a year ago, I've had an emotional rollercoaster since. This money doesn't come around all that often. Maybe if you wisely reinvested something now, you could get that back within 12 months?
You should collect all evidence and go to the police and press charges. Also contact ebay to make them reveal the seller identity.
I don’t think anyone should buy a hardware wallet from a third party. Period. Especially one on eBay. Sorry for your loss. Lesson learned and who knows maybe it saved you from losing a lot more sometime in the future. I always tell everyone that security is the most important thing to learn in this space. 
"Many thanks for your kind words. I fear I will never see that money again. I will for sure keep everyone upto date

"Hi u/moodyrocket. As ive said on a few other posts about this, real sorry to hear what's happened. Awful stuff.

You've just said it was sealed. What was the seal like? Curious because my ledger that I bought direct had no seal, and specifically said on the box, I think, that no seal is required because it's safe to use etc."

"You should work with law enforcement to subpoena Ebay and locate the seller. Prosecute and sue to the fullest extent possible.  

Not very Cypherpunk, but it is what it is."
“99% of Windows computers are probably compromised”. I’m a Mac user but curious if you are serious. If so can you elaborate?
ok
"Sorry to hear this, but your Ledger was not compromised. I bet the hardware is and was intact. It has been initialized with a seed known by the scammer. So that way the scammer was able to access your values. This is nothing you can make Ledger responsible for.

You should have reseted the device. Technically this can be done by entering the wrong Pin several times. Not sure if there was an information gap about this, which might be the responsibility of Ledger or if you should have done more to inform you about Bitcoin and technology.

There is one thing I can say as someone working in IT security and Smartcard business. The Ledger is probably the most secure solution for securing crypto coins at all. "
[removed]
How come you didnt look through ledger nano s website for vendors or dealers? They give u a list and sometimes a link to the site
This guy gets it 100%.
I made that money back and then some on TRX and BCN
"> Dash is Premined. Ripple is not.

XRP was 100% premined, agreed? ""When the Ripple network was created, 100 billion XRP was created."" from their wiki.

Or are you distinguishing between actual mining and just creating coins out of thin air?"
"Making billions selling XRP to the public who are buying it based on the mistaken belief that it is being used by banks as a bridge currency is *a lot* easier than actually convincing banks to actually use it as a bridge currency.

By the way, to convince banks to use XRP as a bridge currency, XRP's price needs to be stable.  That's directly contrary to the ""investors"" interest in XRP rising in value.

> The CEO as well as top execs are most likely bound by a contractual agreement where they can’t cash out and dump all their coins, just like one of the cofounders is.

*Most likely?* Contracts with *who*?  Will holders of XRP be personally compensated if employees violate that agreement as McCaleb tried to do?"
I believe Satoshi is probably dead.  Even if he isn't, or someone in his family has the keys, Satoshi had 1M coins (about 5% of the final supply), which is a *far* cry from 60%.
"so it is matter a %
"
"Because FUD helps noobs who would otherwise invest in a shitcoin. 
I don't own any BTC. I am fully behind ETH and XRP isn't competition. Its just garbage that has been hyped to the moon for no reason. "
"Right, we can settle almost immediately already. I was more referring to securities trades, etc that are traded at T+2 as a standard. Shorter settlement cycles = more trading = more market liquidity.

"
"haha, yeah, if they tried to liquidate 61B ripple today the price would drop to 0. that is the illusion of crypto market cap. 

the liquidity isn't there, the books are too shallow. that's not just ripple though, but crypto in general. however, that doesn't stop wallstreet from seeing Ripple the company, holding 61B, as worth 180B USD, and by extrapolation XRP ecosystem as worth more than BTC currently...

Here we are a day later, and BTC back to 17k, ripple down to 3. 100B ripple is still more than 16M BTC on paper."
"Like you said, tried to do but he couldn’t. There’s a system in place to make sure none of them are running off and screwing the rest of us over. 

I find it more absurd that people can think this is one giant scam. If so then it would be the scam of the century if they actually do it and get away with it. "
Agreed if it can be achieved but a huge amount of global co-ordination and regulation, it’s taken them years to go live with the T2 standard.
Not at a later date. They do not hold on to the XRP in that transaction for any amount of time.
store value ahahahah
But it is a shit coin, centralized, superfluous garbage. Not necessary for what banks are supposedly going to use it for. 
The coin is just a way to invest into the idea and it holds a speculative value. It doesn’t need be decentralised. The idea and network needs to be decentralised, which they are.
I can't say 100% for sure because I don't know. But it being an american company I would think so.
for the same reason you believe satoshi nakamoto won't dump his 10M bitcoins
"How so? It's a cryptocurrency. It just doesn't have the same ideas in mind as BTC, BCH, ETH, etc.     
It's here to solve real world problems."
"Depending on what wallet you have, you can only send or receive XRP, and you need to keep 20 XRP.     
However, that 20 will likely go down soon. It has already gone from 50 to 20 when the price increased, and 20 XRP used to be 5$."
"All crypto is created out of thin air. They don't really exist. The difference is there's no ""mining"" going on in the Ripple network. So you can't say it was ""premined."" Really what this person is saying, ""I only like coins which are based on Proof of Work! Non proof of work coins are a scam!"" /snore"
Poloniex
"XRP a shitcoin?! Oh come on! Give me a break! 😂You know that Ethereum founder (yes, Vitalik Buterin himself) wanted to work for Ripple before creating Ethereum, right? He couldn’t get a Visa, so he created Ethereum instead. You also know he was a speaker at the Ripple Swell conference, right? You also understand Ripple and Ethereum can also work together, right? Ethereum is one of the few cryptos to be ILP enabled (it can connect with the Interledger Protocol).

I wonder if XRP will indeed compete with Ethereum in the future when the smart contracts (Codius) are implemented on the XRP protocol. Time will tell I guess! I think they can work together.

Are you only being salty because XRP just passed ETH in market cap? Yeah right, you’re protecting the noobs by spreading FUD... haha! Good one! Like if the toxic fudsters care about anyone! What about the people you are misleading and that are missing out on a great opportunity? Do you care about them too or you just care about people who follow your shortsighted opinions?

To each their own after all, people buy what they want, why do you even care! There is a bunch of real shitcoins out there, I’m sure you would be more useful in those subs to « protect » noobs if you really care.

It’s not too hard to see XRP has potential with a little research."
For the people who picked up his XRP in the dip, yeah.
"A few days ago I heard 6.16$.   
Edit: a quick recalculation (280b/38b) shows me that a price of 7.32$ will bring Ripple to BTC's current market cap.    
That is assuming it happens this month, as every month 1B XRP is released from escrow.     
If it happened next month, XRP would only need 7.04$, due to increased supply."
"People who believe ""too much"" in a single coin will start attacking other CC's as soon as they become a threat to their own coin's success.     
"
You sold during the dip? *sigh*
"what would be the difference between using USD, as kind of what it is today where USD is the ""bridge"" currency when there is no direct exchange between currency1 and currency2, and a USD-backed token?"
"And that's fine. If two institutions feel that an FX spot transaction doesn't work with xRapid they'll use xCurrent instead... but if they've adopted RippleNet, then they are using xRapid for transactions where it does make sense. Again, there are many types of transactions and not all use cases make sense, and I'm not claiming that.

But the standard has moved from T+5 to T+3 and now T+2, with technology that saves time, costs and risk. So why not just keep moving towards T+0 as technology improves?"
Of course it is.
Yeah exactly 
"Of course, so hedge now and Ponzi òn mighty Stallion! 
We shall then hedge again in the subsequent funding scheme to fight ripple and then its Ponzi Turtles all the way down <*)"
Just one “criptocurency” on coinmarketcap is different from the others.
Haha yea I think this is above my paygrade
"Yeah, that's just not true.     
If all 100B were released right now, the price wouldn't still be at 3$. It would drop a lot due to increased supply. The Market Cap would be roughly the same as it is now, after a week of XRP dropping.      
"
Lol you sure are defensive of your shitcoin
"XRP is now a threat, so this sub has to attack it. That's just how it works.    
If another CC takes BCH's #4 spot, this sub will go after that CC as well. Just you wait."
Decentralization is great.  A coin run by a company is not decentralized-- it is the exact opposite.
">haha, yeah, if they tried to liquidate 61B ripple today the price would drop to 0. that is the illusion of crypto market cap. 

55B.    
Also, no, it wouldn't drop to 0, but it would halve. You're exaggerating.     

"
"
>surprisingly as well its because they were using bitcoin but bitcoin became so slow and unusable some are moving to ripple sooner.

Not really that surprising if you look at BTC's performance."
"Banks can settle T+0 today that’s not the issue, instruments settle T+2 or whatever is specific to their market/tenor Forward FX, Funding swaps etc. 

There will always be settlements that you execute today and want to settle in the future. FX is a good example as it’s one of the most liquid markets. You can trade T+0 FX but people rarely do, the entire short term market is pretty much spot.

The point being it’s not just about changing settlement times it’s also about changing the underlying markets and the thousands of participants. In some cases there is zero incentive to change.

Saving cost is a separate issue but that will always need to be balanced against taking additional risk."
Xrp provides liquidity and security. Bitcoin has this too but banks prefer Xrp over Bitcoin. 
"Perhaps because he can transfer it quickly and at a low fee, or perhaps because his investment is growing.      
I hold BCH, ETH and XRP too."
"Their latest blog post says they aren't adding anything *right now*. You realise how stupid it would be to announce adding a new CC in advance, right?    
If it's coming, it's coming out of nowhere.     
Plus, BCH was listed as ""Not accepted"" only 4 days before it was accepted as a new CC to buy from there. So, they've done unexpected stuff before.      
Another thing, Coinbase is a business. If a coin is experiencing a lot of volume, they want in on it due to the profits, assuming they can handle the load.     
Personally I think CB hasn't added a new CC since BCH due to the massive congestion and strain they're experiencing."

"Guess what, tippr isn't on-chain and holds balance in a database.

Smoke and mirrors. You're being had."
"They'll hopefully no longer outsource to that particular 3rd party provider.  I mean at the very least they should consider moving some mail functions back in house for security.  If you read their response, they appear to have looked into it and dealt with it, and reasonably quickly as well.

How long does it take most corporate entities to address security holes?  Lol equifax sony spectre bah bah bah that's fine i'm mad at reddit!#@!#@

Sorry ranting."
"Fuck no. I was enjoying the peace of being able to browse reddit without running into massive comment threads consisting entirely of people throwing pennies at each other and generating immense spam and off-topic conversation about BCH. 

It's like - whenever someone would make an insightful comment, some retard would say ""HURR DURR TOO POOR FOR GOLD, HERE'S A PENNY IN A SHITTY DIGITAL CURRENCY YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO USE!'"" and it'd derail the entire conversation with questions about BCH and mass tipping. "
Someone once gave me $1 to start my BCH account off, but I never received it. RIP.
holy shit dude thanks! ill get this where it needs to go
Wow you are crazy!!!
Wow. 
Kudos, you tipped the right guy. Since I'm defaulting on my tab anyway, here's a parody token of appreciation... u/tabbr 1 BCH
Hooray!
u/tippr 500 bits
I only have 64 bits - the numbers are too big!
Damn I was beginning to like u/tabbr -500 bch

Thanks, bud.

But I appreciate you donating to people in this community.
How do you withdraw bitcoin after being tipped?
We'll talk about you paying off your tab after the weekend :p
feel free to hide those comment chains
...everyone already knows that. no one's being had.
One nice thing about adoption of cryptocurrencies is that it might allow the bootstrapping of encryption into other services.

... and this is why everything that can be inhouse, should be in house.
Now stop worrying about paying the bills and instead focus on improving bch's lightning network. Or tabs.. Or whatever they call it.
