Sorry to shoot your theory to shit. Crypto is the bulk of my net worth, even still when it's in the shitter. And I don't care. I work to put food on my plate, and only invest play money. Have fun, you'll eat better

Well I suppose everyone's net worth is different. For some people a 90% drop in price is just a few thousands, for others it's millions.
That’s a smart play right now, saying you don’t only have BCH. Roger Ver’s probably pretty upset he dumped his BTC for BCH.
