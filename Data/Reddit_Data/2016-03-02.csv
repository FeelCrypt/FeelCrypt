I'm actually for *removing* the blocksize limit from consensus rules.

That also is ""only a guess"". Security certainly is an aspect for determining value and price, but not the only one. You named some other ones yourself.

"There has to be scarcity in the block size to remain secure. The system cannot be all-inclusive of all things. There are also technological limitations in how big a block can be before other effects are caused that have even greater impact on a users desire to choose Bitcoin over Altcoin, like centralization.

I also balk at forking just to change to mostly arbitrary parameters. It is a cheap solution that brings inordinate risk.

I understand that you are worried people will choose an alternative that has more throughput and cheaper fees, but that is only a guess. If people are trying to send maximum transactions for the cheapest price, they will gravitate towards a more and more centralized solution to match their price point. 

Bitcoin lives in the far end of the ""secure & decentralized"" side of the spectrum.

Any alternative that is faster, cheaper, and higher volume, will also have a lower market price than bitcoin because it will be less secure.

Bitcoin transactions are BETTER than traditional/centralized ones, thus more expensive and scarce."
Cool. Something like [Stephen Pairs proposal](https://medium.com/@spair/a-simple-adaptive-block-size-limit-748f7cbcfb75#.cj7zcfqxw) maybe?
Thanks for clearing that up and kudos for being able to admit to being wrong.
"> There has to be scarcity in the block size to remain secure.

yes, I'm with you on that, but not at artificially, and not at 1 MB. A market should decide, not Peter Todd and Adam Back.

"> Debate better.

ok, I'll try. Sorry for being dismissive before. btw: I'm using **bold** to emphasize points and make my post easier to skim, **not to indicate shouting**.

> I don't understand the problem.

The problem I was hinting at is: **if there is ""real"" transaction demand by ""real"" users (not spam) that *exceeds* the 1 MB capacity, then telling people to ""pay a higher fee"" will not help to satisfy that demand**. You will simply make part of the users pay a higher fee and send the remainder (who payed too low of a fee *compared* to the high-rollers) off to use ethereum or litecoin or fiat or whatever.

**Sending users away *is* a problem in my opinion.**

Can you at least *understand* my point of view?

Figure a better way of fixing it than changing the 1 to a 2 and get back to me.
Now we're talking! I fully support finding a solution that changes block size to a function.
