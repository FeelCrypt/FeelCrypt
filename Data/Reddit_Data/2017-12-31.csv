"Whatever you say, princess.  I've been working in the crypto startup industry for over a year now.  

You're trying to be billy badass of the crypto world here because you imagine you're some kind of long-timer.

You're a wolf of wall street wannabe.  "
So you’ve been working in a crypto startup that long, yet you just started investing a few months back? Right. Who is the retard again?
Wait, if it is possible for BCH to render BTC useless, wouldn't that have already happened?
You are so full of shit. You bought litecoin and that is what you reflected on when discussing gains with your friends and NOT your occupation and all the crypto you already have? Right 
I’d argue that it already has.
"How so?

BTC has $222B market, while BCH has $43B."

"With compact and xthin blocks, 1GB blocks only require 50MB of data to be sent (transactions headers) for a new block.

That assumes that that nodes accumulate most of the transactions during the previous 10 minutes of course.

"
Given how much the internet and technology has improved already, you can kind of assume that. Protocol and optimisation improvements will make it even better but they are not necessary.
I agree that Bitcoin doesn’t work, but Bitcoin Cash does.
"Well it is a systemic problem: the system. I has a hard limit that would have made it obsolete 15 years ago if it was the primary mean of electronic payment used by then. BCH is just pushing the limit further, it would have been obsolete 14 years ago. If you raise the limit to a few GBs it may handle the scale we need, but it's gonna be obsolete soon. 

I pulled these numbers out of my ass but the point is that bitcoin has never been and will not be in its current form able to handle even a fraction of human needs for electronic payments, and bitcoin cash helps so little, it would be able to handle a bigger fraction of these, but still a ridiculously small one. 

The problem **is** systemic, and raising constants just pushes the obsolescence date a bit further, it does not remove it. We need a system that scales infinitely provided that you can throw enough money at it. Bitcoin is not such a system. "
There is the 1GB block tests that were done, and also the theoretical analysis of 1TB blocks using today's tech.
You can't scale the block size infinitely, that's bullshit. You can't just assume that by the time we'll need a 1TB block size the hardware will be available for reasonably cheap to handle such an amount of data. 
"I clearly don't know what I'm talking about. Despite a CS degree and a few months diving into the tech I still have lots of dark spots in my understanding, I cannot deny that. 

That being said, I still grasp a few things and am able to do some basic logical reasoning. I clearly oversimplified by using the term infinity. What I meant is we need the network to be able to handle a number of transactions significantly higher than our need, if we want to keep transactions on chain and hope to see bitcoin democratized while remaining decentralized. 

I find 2 transactions a month per human is ridiculously low compared to what we do in practice. If that's the future of bitcoin I highly doubt that bitcoin will hold any kind of privileged place in the space of electronic payments. We're talking about a GB block size that our hardware currently can't handle (a mid range hardware cannot upload GBs in a matter of seconds in 99% of the world), for a transaction rate far to low for our need.

I understand that we need to explore all possibilities in this space. I see BCH as a good thing that happened to bitcoin core - a possible future being explored and tested out. A quick and temporary improvement in the wait for a long term solution.

I don't see how this could be a long term solution tho. Why are people so confident that this is the perfect system that should only be tweaked but not structurally improved, whereas its reaching its limits while still being underused compared to traditional electronic means of payment by at least 10 thousands folds? "
"> We need a system that scales infinitely provided that you can throw enough money at it. Bitcoin is not such a system. 

[A taste of infinity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zE-IZynfKM)

The system can reasonably scale to commodity hardware and bandwidth limits.

1MB blocks barely scratch the surface of what Bitcoin can do."
"I can't agree. Internet saw new usages develop as the network scaled up. There was no alternative to the internet. Transferring information was going from pain to ease. 

Bitcoin already has its uses, but can't handle the scale by orders of magnitude. There is plenty of alternatives to bitcoin (with some huge players in the field already, thinking about visa, PayPal, western union, and plenty of smaller ones such as the altcoins). If bitcoin scalability isn't fixed some other tech will take its place as primary mean of transfer of value. It just won't scale in its current state, and if it doesn't, people will use something that does. 

People won't go from ease to pain when. It comes to the transfer of value. People won't wait for hardware to become orders of magnitudes cheaper and more powerful just to do what they can already do today very easily. If you think they will, I would be curious to know what makes you think that. 

Just want to add that I don't predict bitcoin death, I think it can be useful in its current form for some niche usage, but this protocol is not able to become people humanity's primary mean of electronic payment however high you raise hash rate and block size. "
"The fact you expect the network to scale infinitely suggests you don't know what you are talking about.

With Gigabyte blocks, the entire population on Earth can do 1 or 2 transactions per month. That is within spitting distance of being useful for everybody: even if it does not replace all commerce. That can be done on mid-range to high-end hardware today.

~2 million transactions per block, 144 blocks/day -> 288 million transactions per day.
288 million tranactions/day * 30 ->8.6 billion transaction per month."
Do you know of some good quality, technical material that would demonstrate such a statement? 
"I don't understand your point. Infinity sure is big, but infinities aren't equal. Some grow bigger and faster than others. You can't just assume that the block size and blockchain size needed to meet humans need for electronic payment won't grow faster than the ability for the hardware to handle such an scale of data.

If it isn't the case, we'll end up with only a fraction of transactions actually confirmed (the ones with ridiculously high fees) and/or a new need for intermediaries (e.g. Lightning network hubs) which kinda defeat the purpose of peer to peer money transfer. "

"NO!  And on top of a NO, XRP are destroyed after each transaction making XRP deflationary.  SO much incorrect info in this thread that it is hard to know where to start.  All I can say is, if you don't like XRP, don't buy it, but quit bitching to the community when you see BTC fall to XRP in 2018, and it will happen.  Bitcoin is slow, expensive to use (transaction fee's), bottlenecks if too many transactions occur at one time, and is controlled by three Chinese mining pools.  What is so decentralized about that!  Ripple will release one node for every two reliable nodes gained.  XRP will therefore be 100% decentralized by the middle of next year.

"> So who is running these nodes outside Ripple? Can I run a node?

Anyone can run a node. Any node can trust (or not trust) any other node. So yes, if enough people ran nodes that excluded Ripple Labs in the trust list, then it would effectively take over the network. Hence Ripple is not centralised by necessity.

> Who can freeze my assets or reverse my transactions?

Idk. Assume anyone with < 50% of the nodes. I'm not familiar with this aspect.

I don't think this is true. In order to make cross-boarder transactions you need to use xConnect which uses XRP, even if the currencies you transact are e.g. USD/EUR."

"Here are some thoughts, since you ask. _(And for this first part, a disclaimer: I am not a lawyer; these are just my thoughts)._

When a company creates software, they are merely _authors_ of a copyrighted work, and there is a right to **free speech.**

But when that company issues units of a _""convertible virtual currency""_ FINCEN might say that the company meets the definition of a _""virtual currency administrator.""_ And if the company then sells those units, FINCEN might say the company is therefore also a _money transmitter_ – and if the company is not licensed to do that (in all 50 states) then they may be an **unlicensed money transmitter,** especially if the company is not identifying the purchasers of those units and verifying that they really are not US persons.

This gives FINCEN an opening for enforcement, and it then becomes a **legal remedy** for the company in question to form a _compliance department,_ to show a _good faith effort,_ and to build KYC/AML features into their product itself (such as the ability to _""freeze funds from afar""_ etc). Again, this could not initially be enforced against mere free speech, but rather, the camel's head enters the tent by targeting the issuance and sale of tokens.

In this way, the sale of tokens becomes the _""Wide gate and broad path that leads to destruction, and many walk it.""_

Note that this issue is entirely separate from any potential SEC issues, CFTC issues, IRS issues, etc. But I think it's the most important one, and Ripple may be a good example of what can happen.

-----------

Some other Ripple-related thoughts for your perusal:

-- I do not personally hold any XRP.

-- I have always been a fan of Ryan Fugger's original concept, and always felt it was important, since it represents a mechanism allowing money to change form along trust paths formed **friend-to-friend,** and also because it allows people (in theory) to enter and exit the network entirely through their friends (versus having to use some regulated 3rd party business). I still think future solutions are coming that exploit this _""friends and family""_ concept.

-- I am friendly with Arthur Britto (co-founder of Ripple) and was in conversations with him before the company was founded. I wish them the best of luck and am happy for their continued success. (Good on them).

This whole sector is so new, and has so much room yet to grow, and there is so much to be done, and so much that has not yet even happened – it's still so early! Everyone should be friendly with each other and realize that ultimately what's coming will be driven by fundamental properties of the new technology and of human nature. **Natural market forces.** That is a compass for how things will go.

PROOF OF WORK IS **KEY**

-- The appearance of the Bitcoin blockchain was like fire from the gods. **Prometheus.** An historic invention, solving a problem previously considered unsolvable, and making many new applications possible, which will impact society profoundly as they are rolled out in coming years.  **Proof of work** is the lynchpin that makes it possible.

-- Proof-of-work is important because it allows anyone from the public to process transactions, even anonymously, _without_ compromising the integrity of the ledger. Without proof-of-work, this would not be possible; you would need some kind of more centralized control over who gets to be a validator, and who does not. When the Stellar ledger forked, we saw IMO what can go wrong in a _""distributed ledger""_ that lacks proof-of-work. This I fear is the biggest problem with Ripple today, though it may not be a problem for them anyway, depending on their **business plans.**

-- I myself have even created a ""distributed ledger"" system (unreleased) that eschews proof-of-work, purely for the exercise of doing it. My conclusion was that it _is_ possible to create a distributed ledger without PoW that ""works"" in the conventional sense (in normal operation) but it is _not secure._ The problems that arise are not in the normal functioning of the system, _per se,_ but rather, in dealing with the various **attacks.** It's when you try to solve the attacks that you find the solution always pointing back to **proof-of-work.**

-- When I went through this exercise, I ended up with a system based on 2-parts: the initial signed transaction request, followed by the confirmation. I was able to prototype it quickly by using Open-Transactions as a financial crypto library. In between the request and the confirmation, I ended up using a series of **iterative rounds** for the validators so that they would validate any transactions that passed through a series of rounds. The first round required 50% of surrounding validators to approve, followed by 60%, then 70%, then 80%. _(I didn't originally plan to use iterative rounds, BTW, but working through the exercise eventually led me in that direction)._ I realized at that point that the project was becoming more and more similar to what Ripple had built. I even started checking their wiki to see how they had addressed various problems I was working through. I eventually dropped the project, but it was a very useful thought exercise for me. It was what finally made me realize the true importance of **proof-of-work.**

-- Bitcoin works IMO (and I originally got this from Daniel Krawisz) due to the **Handicap Principle,** which is seen over and over again in Nature. I view proof-of-work as almost a physical limit. (Sort of like the **speed of light).** Not exactly, of course, but you get the idea. The ""costliness"" of Bitcoin _is_ what secures it.  And it's not even that costly, really, for the security and ""open public operation"" gained in return. Implemented correctly, mining fees are extremely low in comparison to the legacy payment alternatives that Bitcoin is disrupting. The competition of miners, and the mechanism of difficulty adjustments, work together to ensure that in the long term, fees will end up as low as theoretically possible, not much above electricity, and just enough to keep the miners in business. (If following Satoshi's vision).

Bitcoin really is a phenomenal invention, even more than most yet realize. Many think Bitcoin has problems like the _""51% attack""_ or the _""wasted electricity""_ but that thinking merely betrays a lack of understanding about what's really amazing about Bitcoin, and what a _solution_ it really is.

But that's okay, and is to be expected. Financial cryptography is extremely difficult to understand, and even many financial cryptographers (and goldbugs, and economists) missed the boat on Bitcoin entirely. It will only be through its ongoing operation into the future, and various forks, and continued disruption in society, and what ends up working in the real world, that eyes will finally be opened more fully to the implications of this technology."

"> I highly doubt people are going to go to the store and scroll through a list

Well, actually they will  - not going ""through the list"", it seems like an exaggeration - but paying with their cryptocurrency of choice, if it will be more benefitting for them than paying with the credit card.

Examples could be:
a) privacy (unanimous payment)
b) economic stability (especially in the countries with high inflation rate)
c) convenience (if i received a cryptopayment from abroad i can straight away use and transaction can take seconds/minutes, depending on the blockchain/coin)

And so on. Besides micropayments (""for coffee""), there is also cross-border payments market.

And besides payments there is also miriad of different uses for the crypto - starting from smart contracts and ending with solar power trading.

So, yes - it's a speculative market, but these speculations are not hanging in the air, cryptocurrencies are definitely a new asset class and here to stay."
Spot on dude. In the end, it's a big world out there and there's room for many crypto projects. Ripple is made by banks for banks and claims to be a better and more more secure settlement network for them (I actually work in IT at a bank and can tell you, this is very very welcome!). What's wrong with that? If BCH gets enough adoption that we can ditch banks entirely, that'll be great. In the mean time, faster, cheaper, and more secure banks seem like a good thing to me.
thats right
so many negative points and rants about ripple lately. this is not a good sign, right?
I'm a BTC supporter, but i do highly agree with you. Both BTC and BCH communities have got to get their shit together and unite against this banker attempt to hijack crypto world! They tried to divide us in order to weaken us. Ripple is just the same old broken corrupt financial system in a new clothing.

It would allow them to cut headcount. If you don't need as many people then your income doesn't have to be as high to maintain the same level of profitability. In fairness. They will not lower fees until forced, but they are already seeing a waterfall in fee revenue as customers are going other places for cheaper services.
It most certainly will happen as soon as they find a better revenue generating product or they use the efficiency of the technology to lower headcount so that the lower revenues don't have a negative impact on the bottom line.
Yes I think so too. But before you can send it to bank B, you have to already hold the xrp to be able to send it. This will leave you open to insane fluctuations in contrast to USD for example, especially if you and bank B normally transact in USD anyway.
"> A blockchain is a database, and nothing more.

What? Nothing more? I am not sure you're trolling or just havent understood what bitcoin is. Read the friggin white paper now. Please. It's six pages FFS.  A blockchain qcgieves trustless distributed consensus through proof of work. That is a huge deal. A game changer. It's the opposite of 'nothing more'.

> There's nothing wrong with running a private SQL database.

Of course not. But it is what it is. And whomever owns it cab do whatever with it. You have to trust that one entity. If you don't understand why this undermines the whole point of a strong and secure currency, I'm afraind its no use explaining it anyway.

> Well what about an improved private database secured with cryptography. It may not be immutable, but one could combine the trust in the company with the trust in cryptography to have a reason to use that private database over a standard SQL database. SQL databases don't have cryptographic integrity.

It's not secured with cryptography because whomever owns it also owns the checksums, hashes or whatever pseudo-security you're talking about. Integrety can be easily achieved without cryptography and proper relational database systems have been doing it for 40 years.

A blockchain is just a data structure which enables the possibility of securing data immutability through rewards for proofs of work. If you remove proof of work,  iy becomes useless.  If you want to chrck the integrety of a blob just use a checksum like it has been done for decades."

There's a non-absurd argument that 2MB would hurt *trackability* of users of the system. Other than profit from sidechains that's the only sensible motive I can think of for wanting 1MB instead of 2MB is that it's twice as easy to track people through.

"I disagree.  The beginning and end of the discussion around BTC's future is one word - censorship.  When the major forums around BTC are censored - that is absolutely enough for me to call BTC dead regardless of its tech or blocksize or confirmation times or whatever...

Simply based on censorship, BTC needs to die as a coin.

Since 99% of users don't know or dont care about the subject, that is why I am worried.  A simple blocksize increase by core can do real harm to the non-censored version of Bitcoin.

"The only one I see that does not also affect BTC is that it is easier for a dishonest miner to perform a 51% attack. I'm betting on BCH catching up to BTC on hashrate soon, so this will no longer be a problem for BCH.

On the other side BTC will have major issues if BCH overtakes it as the difficulty algorithm can take a long time to adjust.

BCH has no centralisation problem for the foreseeable future and by that time, solutions like LN will have time to have been implemented and tested.

BTC's large fees are currently causing centralisation issues, where large miners can avoid fees, but small miners cannot."
Compared to Bitcoin Core? Not really. Bitcoin Core hasn't been updated any time recently except for a really bizarre hack called Segregated Witness that can't be considered the best way to achieve even its own goals by any measure at all unless you (a) refuse all hard forks but also (b) consider systematically tricking every old node and giving it false data that doesn't allow it to verify old transactions as for some reason not counting as a hard fork.
It's not linearly scalable. The block size would grow far faster than bandwidth and storage capability. It will eventually need LN and so then be no different than bitcoin
OK well both the average and lowest fee are more than what you said, so what you said was wrong. Now that you've changed what you're saying to $2, now you're correct, because you said a different thing.

What makes Bitcoin decentralized?

Decentralization is one of Bitcoin's main selling points. But what does it actually mean? Skip to the end for the tl;dr

**What is centralization**    
As we all know from reading everything Satoshi wrote about his design for Bitcoin from satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org, Bitcoin was finalized and born in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. In this event many normal people lost money while banking executives made more and more. 

**Where does centralization come from**       
These banks, much like the bank you probably use today, are centralized. That is, they alone control everything that happens. There is one database which has everyone's funds, if they decide you are a terrorist or something they can stop you from access your money. They can stop you from making transactions. Even if you have done nothing wrong they can stop payment on your transactions without your consent, lock you out of your funds, and monitor everything you do. 


**What  is decentralization**       
By splitting up the 'power' that a bank has we decentralize it. There is no longer any one single entity that can control txs and funds. This way no one is 'in charge' and no one can give themselves bonuses while other people lose money. This decentralization is a founding point of Bitcoin.

**Where does decentralization come from**       
Instead of one company controlling the database of funds like in the centralized model, in Bitcoin's decentralized model there are many people who can all contribute to the database and transaction processing without any one entity having full control. In Bitcoin and other POW based cryptocurrencies this decentralization is achieved by having a number of *mining nodes* who are not affiliated. As long as no group of miners controls more than 51% of the hashpower, bitcoin remains decentralized.

---


**So only mining nodes contribute to decentralization, then what about non-mining nodes**      
Non-mining nodes, full nodes, relay nodes, or storage nodes are often misunderstood to be part of decentralization. This can be easily cleared up by understanding the above information and then understanding that a non-mining node has no *power* if the majority of hashpower were to do something they didn't like. 

**I thought everyone was supposed to run a full node**      
This is another common misunderstanding, in the very beginning Satoshi did intend for everyone to run a node with 4 functions. He is very clear when he explains how this is not the way for the system to function in the future. The plan of bitcoin is that everyone can make trustless peer-to-peer transactions on a decentralized system. Not that everyone would run a home server with the whole blockchain. The business and bitcoin companies that need to have personal and instant validation of their tx can run a full nodes. Random sampling is a tried and trusted method, those unable to host their own relay node would be easily able to verify their transactions with overwhelming mathematically certainty.

**So who wants to run a full node then**     
Anyone who wants to can, it's like the Olympics, 'anyone can compete but few feel the need to'. There is no reason the network should be ground to a halt and made useless so people who can't afford to make a transaction would be able to run a full node on a 20 year old computer over a dial up connection. Bitcoin was meant to scale with technology, not become left behind. 


**What are the 4 functions that all early nodes did**       
When you read the design of Bitcoin which we all invested into, the design on which so much was built, the one at nakamotoinstitute.org, you see Satoshi mention the word 'node' many times. What we today call a full node or non-mining node usually fulfills one of those functions, that of storing the database. Finding other peers for connecting to is done by full nodes and pool operators. Sending and receiving bitcoin, aka a wallet, was also a function every node had. Finally generating coins by putting new transactions into the blockchain was the 4th thing all nodes used to do. Today these 4 actions are largely compartmentalized, as they should be in any good computer science project.

---


This is Bitcoin, some people are unhappy with the way Bitcoin was designed, well I suppose Bitcoin is simply not for those people and they should maybe find something else to do.


I hope you've all learned something today about how Bitcoin is decentralized, what is means, and how we got there.

tl;dr Banks control all txs and accounts with one database and are centralized, Bitcoin has many miners who perform this actions to make it decentralized. Non-mining nodes don't contribute to decentralization. "
Agreed. DAI is the honest Tether.
"Decentralization isn't the goal, just means to an end; that end being censorship resistance.

By charging high fees, you're in fact censoring small transactions, as well as big transactions with several small inputs. There is no point in making your coin decentralized if only the rich can actually use it."

Awesome! :-)

"Bitcoin supporters don't think it's ""fine"". We think it's the price you pay for decentralization. Bitcoin has no deadlines for getting everything right. But when Bitcoin does, all of this trouble we've gone through with high fees will be worth it. Decentralization can be sloppy, inefficient, and expensive. But the end result is a product that will change the world."

BTC is still the coin of record because its the medium of exchange for most brokers. Creating a multitude of trading pairs is too complex and using the dollar as the medium of exchange just encourages people to cash out, which benefits nobody. Until brokers' developers come back from vacation and complete some reconfiguration, BTC is ensconced.

we've all been there.
Best Meme I've seen all year.
As long as you hold an equal amount of both coins, you will be fine. Both sides have risks and it is hard to wade through all the misinformation that is out there. On both sides. I prefer the side where the information flows freely and is uncensored.
"Blocksize increase proposals were fairly common just 2-3 years ago but that group has been ignored or silenced. 

I think the majority of big block supporters just moved on to alts and BCH, and for people who own far more cryptos than Bitcoin they now see our debates becoming more and more irrelevant in the grand scheme of things."
Well the point of BTC is penny stocks, the point of BCH is to actually become a currency. So if BCH halves but becomes a widely used currency it's okay. Meanwhile if BTC crashes it pisses off the majority of owners. They have differences in goals. 
This is true. We need a BCH exchange. I want to buy more altcoins but can't due to the limits of Ether, and Bitcoin Core. I refuse to use Tether. 
When are they back from vacations? 
MKR DAI is available on radar relay and launched on ethereum. 1 dollar = 1 Dai and adjusted through smart contract. I think BTC will lose dominance when its added to exchanges. It's still brand new but will be a paradigm shift.
This too will change.

"> all of this trouble we've gone through with high fees will be worth it

"> We think it's the price you pay for decentralization.

But you have completely no proof at all that this causes decentralization.

Also, you are not following Satoshi's vision. He was the genius that created all cryptocurrencies, not Adam Back, Luke ""Sun revolves around earth"" Jr. or Greg ""Champagne"" Maxwell.

What you are pushing is just a shitty altcoin, you just stole the ""Bitcoin"" name and that is all.

If you wanted to play fair, you would just create a separate project with high fees, ""fee market"" and all that cruft. but you didn't. Instead, you chose to con everybody who believed in original Bitcoin into believing that your shitcoin is the real deal."
While it is fine that there is a price to pay for decentralisation, it doesn't appear that the cost of BTC is justified. Bitcoin Cash is decentralised and works just fine with negligible fees.
"> We think it's the price you pay for decentralization

did you come to that conclusion yourself or are you echoing someone else's words?"
How is the proposed solution of lighting network anything else but centralization? 
"Decentralization? If the fees is so high, it is literally impossible to mine unless youre a big miner. Where is the decentralization in that? How is lightning hubs not the new banks?

What you are doing is putting all your faith in something that Blockstream thinks will work. There are no guarantees at all that this will work."
LOL decentralization.  Riiiiight.  Keep sipping that delicious kool-aid
Real Bitcoin supporters don't trust Core over Satoshi. We've already had it in mind to try big blocks before Core existed and Segwit was conceived. You won't have any users on your decentralized coin if you don't address the fee situation, and it's absolutely absurd to argue that 2MB would introduce irreparable damage to centralization.
Too late for that, BCH has momentum that won't go away because of a blocksize increase with BTC. Meanwhile, a blocksize increase there will destroy all sorts of claims and narratives that led to the mess in the first place. And, frankly, it's not going to happen. They're too invested in those narratives to do the right thing, even now.
But they already *did* increase the blocksize, SegWit *is* a block size increase. /s

That is about as clear as you can get, segwit is wanted and people are still begging for it.

As for why they are still begging for it today, it is because it is way late getting here because of greed and power plays.  We should have been here two years ago and we would have been if it wasn't for the greed and power plays.

"It's a simple graph theory problem, you can have each node frequently poll n ~ 3/4 hops away from themselves, then store all node uuids/pubkeys from themselves and those nodes in an index (est, 20kb).  Then you can randomly poll nodes on the network via a tracker or whatever for routes to a key, and then once you have one you do the same thing for the intermediate route.  Avoids the exponential lookup problem.  Well, that's my thought after about 10 seconds of thinking about it.

Even storing a million pubkeys/declared node addresses in an index - what is that, 50mb?"
Neither are bank transfers - at least the real cost is not free.

"That's great and all, but we're talking about LN implementations. All of which are written to create and use segwit transactions.

My question is, how will BCH get LN, _if there's no one working on the code changes to make LN software compatible_?"
"Hmmm. I would think that payments will *not* be bi-directional i.e. balanced unless average folks have their salary paid into LN. 

Which makes for a much more dynamic and possibly unstable network - in the absence of external control or direct incentives (rebalancing txns @ low or no cost). I am basing a lot of this on banking settlement models like RTGS, where absence of liquidity for one or two large transactions can quickly destabilize the network and bring it to a halt, ending in bank runs ...
 "
So why use any crypto currency then?
"> Possible, yes, but is it probable?

almost certain."
"And many capacity improvements are being worked on, segwit itself includes a small blocksize increase but most people don't seem to want to take advantage of it. 
"
"Bitcoin has only failed if you're short-sighted and don't look at its future. 

There isn't a single coin that's ready for mass adoption scale, none, so obsessing about which one will be #1 during 2018 is quite useless. 

Bitcoin and Ethereum are the only ones I know about with real and serious solutions to scaling, the rest of them are pretending that because they can handle their current scale, that will always be the case."
">LN Isn't real until the decentralizaion routing problem is solved, it's vaopware until then.

BGP, tor, etc....

>***IF*** this problem can **ever** be solved, then it will be trivial to add to bch, so trivial it can be done *sooner* than it willbe added to legacy bitcoin.

It's not about adding anything to BCH, LN is it's own software using Bitcoin's existing smart contracts. If people want to use LN on BCH then BCH either needs to add segwit or someone needs to write a version of LN software that doesn't use segwit. You can not take existing LN software and use it on BCH out of the box, it won't work.

>How can LN work when the fundamanal technology isn't real and may not ever be?

How can mirrors be real if our eyes aren't real?"
Show us the calculations on that model,  including the impossible amounts of collateral locked up by hubs...  Meaning only banks and well-funded corporations can 'play'  the LN game and win. 
"Lol,  you just showed how irrelevant Core and yourself are with respect to fixing the mess core and blockstream created.

Except that you can download and run any of the 3 LN implementations and route payments over multiple hops, today.

As it is defined now, I would hope not. LN is a useless, rent-seeking solution which offers no advantage over simple, free, instant bank to bank transfers which are possible in many places now. 
"I haven't run calculations, I'm as in the dark as everyone here, just thinking it out.  

But in general, my impression was that if channels are sufficiently large relative to the payments they're routing, the variation in channel balances would basically be a one dimensional random walk tending towards 0, with the route breaking if the current balance minus the prospective loss needed for a payment were less than zero - since payments are theoretically close to bidirectional.

This pissing contest is getting old and is harming bitcoin, who knows where would be now if we did not have these hold-ups.  I can't help but think that without all of the blocking we would have gone a lot of the way to solving the scaling issue properly."

"Segwit also increased the blocksize, but it wasn't enough. Other improvements are being worked on, efficiency gains take priority over block size increases because they don't come with extra long-term costs.

"> LN could have been done without segwit, in the words of Blockstream CTO. As in any simple malleability fix could have been used Perhaps you know better.

It could have, and whats more it could have been done without a mailability fix at all (kind of messy though).  However, since we had segwit on the way it was much cleaner to do it that way.  Unfortunately, we did not count on the greed and power grabs that would hold it up.

> Miners are the ""voters"" in Bitcoin, 

Not really and not anymore, they were greedy and the power has been taken away from them.  Us users like you and I are now the people that decide on changes in bitcoin.

"
If you can tolerate 10 channels and 11 hops, with roughly equal distribution, it should support the world population.  Doesn't seem too bad.  The onboarding is the tough part.
It does hurt the brain to start imagining edge cases and gotchas...  Existing systems like rtgs do give some examples to view against,  tho.
But cryptos aren't simple, free and instant.
"Yeah, that's how you map the nodes. Now you have to find a route. That means each leg of the route has to have sufficient funds to be able to support your desired transfer. And balances are always changing in real-time.

Fun part: we were promised channel privacy, so you aren't allowed to disclose balances."
Do the math, that model doesn't scale. Certainly not once you add malicious nodes and AML/KYC to the equation.
"My assertion is that if people wanted it and there was universal support behind it; Segwit would have been enabled at the latest 3 months ago.


There are no power plays; everyone that didn't want Segwit went to BCH.

"LN could have been done without segwit, in the words of Blockstream CTO. As in any simple malleability fix could have been used Perhaps you know better.

 You pieced that together to suit your narrative.  I don't know was response to the second sentence in his post. 
The truth is that Core/Blockstream failed when they were given many chances.  The joke is that so-called cypher punks turned anti-banking  protocol into a plaything for speculators and hedge funds.  Nice work Adam and Greg! 
"Well, the degree to which it's not bidirectional would result in channel turnover or refunding, I guess.  Starting to get a headache thinking about this ;)."
"?? 

LN Isn't real until the decentralizaion routing problem is solved, it's vaopware until then.

***IF*** this problem can **ever** be solved, then it will be trivial to add to bch, so trivial it can be done *sooner* than it willbe added to legacy bitcoin.


How can LN work when the fundamanal technology isn't real and may not ever be?"
Because LN is not the only option? Payment channels are working *now* on Bitcoin Cash ... 
"Mmn, that is a complication.  They may have developed this already, IDK, but my guess is that it'd narrow it down to an appropriately small size of potential routes and then basically do a traceroute along each of them to find viable and optimal paths.  If ""privacy"" includes the potential transmitter not knowing the balance to be *sent*, that sounds next to impossible, but if it's just not having to disclose how much is in the channel, and they could just return a confirmation as to whether or not they can route it, I think that would work.  That's basically depth first search across the set of potential nodes.

edit: I got a few details to figure out about LN, don't take anything I say here as definitive."
good question. I would say freedom and ability to control your own money ... subject to the plans of developers and their investors, ofc.
"Why are you telling us this? If Lightning is production ready then where is my mainnet Lightning wallet? Not demoware, the real deal? Where is the load testing of its gossip routing?

Srsly lol"
Fixing critical bugs (like hitting capacity limits) is also not necessary, but it's a good thing to do. 
So BCH won't have LN then?
"It is what they propose for a solution for the scalability problem, I'm not saying that it is a good solution or that it doesn't have any flaws.

It still looks like a completely complex hack that could be avoidable. It's not ""teleportation"" advanced, it's bad design."

"LN is not a scaling solution.  Lightning Network has major problems.  For one it has been [proven to be centralized](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6jqrub/game_over_blockstream_mathematical_proof_that_the/). As [Jiang Zhouer says](https://cointelegraph.com/news/chinese-exchange-huobi-asks-bitcoin-core-expert-to-address-scaling-issues):

> “LN [Lightning] will nurture monopoly LN processor like Alipay or Wechat Pay. By that time, the government could easily shut down the LN in the name of AML. Then the LN transaction will be transferred to the 1M mainnet, the 100x transaction demand will jam the network and soon the network will be paralyzed as well.”

The narrative about malleability and the need for LN was also a [complete false narrative and Bitfury created Lightning Network without segwit or malleability fix](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6qgngo/here_is_proof_that_segwit_is_not_needed_for/).  We can have payment channels on BCH and [Yours.org has already created them](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/722kqu/interesting_interview_from_ryan_x_charles_about/).  Also [LN probably won't be here anytime soon according to this awkward moment at Breaking Bitcoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/761guf/reminder_very_awkward_moment_at_breaking_bitcoin/).  LN might have some niche use cases, but overall there is just not much market demand for LN or it would be here already. "
And Bitcoin is a complex solution to solve the double spending problem. So? I'd say increasing the block size is a dumb hack to solve the scalability problem (which it doesn't).
"Why would anyone pay with a deflationary currency? Just use Litecoin! It's much faster!

At least that's how I'm reading it in the [white paper](https://supernet.org/en/technology/whitepapers/BarterDEX-Whitepaper-v0.4.pdf#page=16). Atomic swaps via HTLCs requires only one on-chain transaction on each chain. Doing it via Lightning requires 0-1 on-chain transactions on each chain."

The major problem is that Bitcoin is being strangled by high fees.  The network will die if a solution isn't found soon.  And so far, the only solution the core developers are working on is Lightning.  If Bitcoin were healthy, then delays in Lightning wouldn't be harmful.  But Bitcoin is far from healthy right now.

"**Quantum teleportation**

Quantum teleportation is a process by which quantum information (e.g. the exact state of an atom or photon) can be transmitted (exactly, in principle) from one location to another, with the help of classical communication and previously shared quantum entanglement between the sending and receiving location. Because it depends on classical communication, which can proceed no faster than the speed of light, it cannot currently be used for faster-than-light transport or communication of classical bits. While it has proven possible to teleport one or more qubits of information between two (entangled) atoms, this has not yet been achieved between molecules or anything larger.

Well the main point I think is that its an over promise.  They are pretending LN will have capabilities that it will not.

Again, representatives don't monitor the blocks of individual people, they are called upon to vote to choose a transaction whenever _any_ node detects a double spend. Nodes are following every transaction they see. 

The point of choosing a representative is precisely to prevent sybil attacks, the vote of each representative is weighted by how many coins they represent. "

>The voting system does look interesting though, choosing a representative to monitor your own blocks, but it seems there could be some security concerns still in this regarding double spending.

The representatives don't monitor your blocks, they are called upon to vote whenever any node detects a double spend, so that they can decide what transaction to keep. The fact that their votes are weighted by the amount of coins they represent is just a way to prevent a sybil attack on the vote. "
"Well there are proof of stake coins that don't use 100% premine, so that is a choice, though it does make things simpler I can see that.  Also, ""they gave it away for free"" is neither a provable statement, nor would it matter to somebody that didn't get in on that action.  The coin is fully distributed, so to a newcomer it's the same.  Either you were part of that distribution, or, the coin doesn't really look as good to to you does it.  The voting system does look interesting though, choosing a representative to monitor your own blocks, but it seems there could be some security concerns still in this regarding double spending.  "
Thanks for your reply :)  Well, if the design calls for 100% premine, I would say - change the design!  Who would touch such a coin?  Well many people apparently :)  As to the voters, what is preventing me from selecting my second self (sybil) as the representative that monitors my blocks?

"This guy is a well meaning idiot. He fell for the ""let's do this very very very very cautious"" arguments and didn't understand the robustness already build into the basic bitcoin protocol

edit: typo"
Then, he went full retard.
This guy stole from Dash proposal system. 
Charlie was actually wrong... WESTERN UNION is cheaper than Bitcoin!
We did increase block size Charlie.
The price increase brainwashed all
That aged well.

He is a criminal and went to jail. 
Exactly.  For those willing to look beyond the fork bullshit, will realise what the real value is.
"Geez. The experiment has already proven that small blocks *cause* massive centralisation of coins on exchanges, taking private keys out of the hands of users. That is way worse than shutting down a few Raspberry Pi's that do nothing but slow down the network, which by the way also cannot handle small blocks because the mempool is too big.

Also what is way worse is the amount of uneconomically spendable coins and pricing everybody except the wealthy out of being a Bitcoin user."
This is exactly it.
He promised a Dash debit card, took the money and didn't deliver, so he's persona non grata at Dash.
"Charlie was very pro-onchain scaling in early 2017, and during this time he became very active in the Dash community (which also embraces onchain scaling - remember, this was before the BCH Fork). He made a proposal to the Dash Budget System for a Dash-branded debit card, it passed, and he receive the funds.

Shortly after it passed (very shortly!), he changed his tune and became a vocal Core apologist. He stopped communicating with the Dash community, his debit card project fizzled, and he basically became persona non grata there.

People can form their own conclusions, but the whole thing is suspicious."
Source?
he's a proponent of BCH? link?
Cautious. Sorry.
how
Reminds me of political parties after a leadership race. One moment they're correctly pointing out all the problems with their opponent. Then they lose, the opponent wins, and suddenly they are praising all the things they used to criticize. 
"$1 u/tippr

Charlie you shmuck quit drinking the koolaid, you fluffy animal."
Might be the whole centralization thing that's also like PayPal. 
"I think he started to work on Dash.  
Thus he has now an interest to see Bitcoin crippled."
Where have you all been?  All that matters is he's came to his senses and he's a proponent of BCH now.  He's seen the light.

Why are the post in the big block sub about small blocks? Sorry guys but if you don't start believing in your own tech instead of hating the other tech you are handing over all your power on a silver plate. The fork already happened, the rest moved on, it's time for r/btc to move on as well. This is Crypto, nobody invests in football teams, we invest in tech. 
"I'm happy for you... Now tell me, which one of the coins' rises and drops gets portrayed across the whole of cryptocurrency...? If Bitcoin drops, BCH drops, because Bitcoin is Cryptocurrency to the public. So good luck piggybacking off Bitcoin with you BCH 👌


Also, do you just completely blank out the shady stuff behind BCH or what?"
"Am i the one calling life unfair when people do thing without consolting me? No, that's you, the crybaby who is doing that.

Look I'm sorry bitcoin sacred you so much. Sorry"
"yeah like people don't hold your hand in the real work, away from your mom and her basement

they said they woudl do something they did that, they own you nothing,but still you act like a big crybabay


how do I get that remindmebot 2 months to activate so I can come back later and laugh at you more?"
"Where was I being a 'crybaby'? I didn't realise you had to suck the dick of a company or cryptocurrency 24/7, or even have your own personally constructed opinions on an event by reading the straight up facts. If not doing that makes me a crybaby, then I guess I'm a crybaby ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 


And who is the one who started attacking the other because they are, hmm, let's say frustrated, with the price just plummeting on their crypto of choice, before anyone can even sell it for BTC on the biggest exchange for the public. I'm sorry Bitcoin holds more value and you got in late or whatever it is that is making you whine... But stop crying to me pls thx xo <3"
"Boy oh boy, stop projecting your own life on me dude, it's getting sad. I'm sorry that you have had to have this coddling in your life, and I thank you for explaining your first-hand experience to me. <3


Can you seriously not setup a remindme bot? 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂No wonder why you support BCH 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂"
"what are you even talking about?


lol chaing btc to bch was a great decision

how to /u/remindme 1 year

"Thats a good point, perhaps the ""Bitcoin"" name might become completely toxic due to Core/Blockstream mistakes or other issues. For now, I think Bitcoin is still not a lost cause and many people still want to continue the vision described in satoshis white paper."

"> Do both parties have to be using coinomi

Any wallet app with qr code reader and bch support will do. I just mentioned Coinomi as a recommendation Specially for merchants.

About the fees:

* Network fees are needed every time you send crypto coins as payment to the network miners who processes your transactions.

* Fees can be set by the customer (i.e. 5k SATs, 10k SATs, etc.)

* For microtransactions, its ok for customers to set fees to zero. Network miners will not mind it. ;-)

* Merchants don't care about fees, they just want to get paid. ;-)"
Shop cat hooray!

The tech that works will win in the end even if people don't believe in it.
