"#""We are coming and we are coming in waves!""

Unfortunately, too true. 
"> the war on drugs is doing exactly what it was designed for

Failed prohibition, weed legalization, dicussion about psychodelics. U can't ban useful things"
The War on Drugs is about money, not control. It's a cash grab. Most things politicians do are.
this is the only reason that makes sense to me why would government ban crypto.
This is why we need cooperative agorism in other industries, such as internet access and energy production. There's so much more to do, even if we get basic cash transactions right.
"drugs are also not mainstream and no investor would touch it \- so what? it doesn't make the drug problem go away. same with crypto \- yes, you can ban it but what exactly is the purpouse? the black market will use it either way.

so yes governments can make the speculation/trading thing much less attractive \- but speculation/trading is not something anybody has a problem with. so effectivelly a ban would reduce any benefits to society and nefarious purpouses would stay uneffected. so again \- what exatly would a ban achieve?"
Over what time scale? Short term thinking is cancer when you're talking about crypto
"https://qz.com/1109470/bitcoin-highest-price-is-in-zimbabwe-due-to-a-forex-shortage/

Any time there are rumors that some enormous country will try to ban it, price usually drops yes. But no enormous country has yet been stupid enough to try. Because the inevitable result is what happens when tiny shithole countries try to ban it. "
"> If they are tracking IP addresses used by wallets that makes it much more difficult for users.

VPNs and other proxies are very prevelant nowadays.  It's a cat and mouse game.

> Like I said it’s not impossible, but it’s definitely possible to make it enough of a hassle most people won’t bother.

I disagree with many of your arguments, but this is a very very good one and you absolutely deserve credit for making it.  You're absolutely right that all they need to do is make it too bothersome.  It's an economic battle, and if you make something more costly, you disincentive people from doing that thing.

> People only torrented because it was easier, now that streaming services are around its way less common.

That's completely right too!  In fact, that's a common argument I make for piracy.  It forces businesses to adapt to the market, rather than artificially holding back progress with laws that benefit corporate incumbency.  You have Napster and torrents to thank for having iTunes and Netflix.  Like Gaben said, piracy is a service issue.

> People are willing to pay for convenience. If fiat is the most convenient payment method that’s what most people will use.

Again, I completely agree.  My argument is that technology will improve, and because there is benefit to the crypto community for it to be adopted, the community will continue to innovate ways to make it easier and easier to use, in the face of and despite any laws and regulations."
They should be. It will be the necessary warning to anyone else who would try the same approach. Any country that does this will pay a huge cost for no benefit. If that's what they want to do well you can't save stupid people from themselves. You can just expose them to the consequences of their actions. 
Not really, not anymore than miners flocking to cheap electricity.
"As far as I can see, he's a little reactionary but he seems to have his head on straight when it comes to crypto... it's something he's obviously passionate about and what he's striving to build is what brought me into crypto to be begin with - I feel like BCH is what BTC should have been at this point

That's my opinion"
"Huh? Copyright law is totally enforceable... what do you mean by that?

And I think Apple and android aren’t allowed to offer apps that are considered illegal already, right"
It can be both. It’s more directly about money, but also the political power of giving felonies which strips voting rights in some states.

"I understand what u meant, but formulating it as state has some power over Bitcoin future is missing the point: Bitcoin is above jurisdictions, it's unstoppable and it erodes the concept of nations

> to scare a lot of people into not using it

Sure. Until hyperinflation bursts out. U can't hide Bitcoin from people forever. And it may ""scare other nations in"" in international competition. More China pushes bitcoiners down, more South Korea and Japan will give bitcoiners oxygen etc

> If I could face 5 years in jail for having a bitcoin wallet on my phone

It also about enforceability. If your contry aren't able to ban a Bitcoin wallet from local Play Store, what are they going to do? Cut out Android ecosystem, Apple ecosystem, the Internet? It just like with the copyright law - unenforceable bullshit"
Interesting. I agree bitcoin has become less usable and more expensive over time. I saw a video by Roger Ver that made similar arguments. What do you think of him?
"And that’s why it likely won’t happen. Im just saying it’s possible.

Also, I doubt 99% of the total population would care. Crypto adoption is only a couple percent currently. "
It didn't have 1TB blocks
Which is just shooting themselves and their nations in the foot while the rest of the world leaps ahead. That's not a threat to crypto, it's a threat of self harm. 
Good thing there are some countries that are very crypto friendly, I predict these countries will be hosting all the big miners in the future.
"No single party is able to coerce them all, and even if they could it simply shatters the graph and a part forks off guerilla style and continues with the ruleset prior to coercion. That's why we're here, after all. More than that actually, the miners are cynically exploiting the hijackers by mining their fake chain for more stake in the real chain.

The simple fact is, whatever the ideal form of currency blockchain is, some dispersed group will continue to mine it, and the group able to recognize it will continue to buy it. That's how markets work, and there's nothing that can be done to change it. Literally the most profitable thing for attackers to do is give up and join the game themselves. And they will. "
bitcoin was working long before huge datacenter mining farms.
"Ah, that explains the awesome success of the war on drugs and terror.

Things just don't work that way. Sorry. "
It would also make 99% of the population very very angry, and make Monero the #1 coin
Satoshi invented bitcoin nearly 10 years ago. He vanished, and gradually a bunch of toxic trolls took over the project. They enacted policies harmful to bitcoin adoption by making it slow, unreliable and expensive to use. To hide the facts of what they're doing they took over big forums and the bitcoin subreddit and heavily censored it. Businesses, users and developers abandoned Bitcoin. The brain drain resulted in one of the worst echo-chambers on reddit and whoever remains loyally comitted to BSCore/Bitcoin at this point is just about hopelessly brainwashed.
"It’s kinda impossible to directly tie price movement to news, but I thought the “China ban” was a big reason for the previous few year bear market (along with mt gox) and the price didn’t increase until it was clear they weren’t gonna crack down.

If China decided to make mining illegal and shutdown bitmain and other large mining facilities I guarantee that would fuck over BCH for years"
"People use whatever they honestly believe they ought to use in their own interests, and the free market works out who was right. To the extent the people presently at the top manage to maintain their power, it will be because they were able to compete in a fully free market, rather than because they bought the political system which they used to their advantage. If they can out-compete everyone else, then they've earned their position.

Frankly I doubt that's going to be how it works out, because these people have been shielded from real competition for so long they have not the faintest idea how it really works, and the way they think and operate is simply to look for the rent-seeking opportunities and exploit them, well, they're not here anymore, so if they keep doing that, they're just sealing their own fate.

Look at their actual responses; Shut it down, Bitcoin is rat poison, It's used by pedophiles and terrorists oy vey, how can we stop it, how can we regulate it, christ what can we do to make sure we don't actually have to provide genuine value and can maintain our moats? Anything but actually having to provide value.

The exact response of someone who will never succeed in a free market.

"
You can't compare something as speculative as crypto to the internet. A ban on crypt now would easily set it back years, obviously you can't really ban the internet (just look at Tor).
"I see the /s, but the war on drugs is doing exactly what it was designed for. It’s imprisoned a fuck ton of non-violent minorities at much higher rates compared to white people (even though usage rates are about the same). It’s allowed the for profit prison model to take off. And asset forfeiture laws using drug crimes earn the government billions.

Overall for the government trying to control/profit from its people it’s been amazing. 

 "

Source? I thought every time a big country threatened to ban it the market went down

Yes but they can still do it, and their citizens will be negatively impacted.
Sounds like a centralization problem?
"Yeah sorry, that’s what I meant. 

Regulating the citizens is enough to scare a lot of people into not using it. If I could face 5 years in jail for having a bitcoin wallet on my phone or if I was found using crypto through my IP that would greatly decrease the usability. I probably wouldn’t bother with it at that point. 

If the government in the US ever actually got to that point I’d be very worried though"
"> Huh? A country could make it illegal to convert fiat to crypto.

Then you'd just exchange it in another country.  This is all done online, what the hell do borders matter?"
"This has nothing to do with any governments banning crypto though... it’s just due to their own currency being fucked.

>“Interest in bitcoin has peaked as people cannot send money outside or pay for international transactions using formal banks,” said Kusangaya. “People have had to look for alternatives and bitcoin has been a useful solution which can be used to purchase goods on Amazon or to pay for vehicles from international suppliers and traders,” she said."
"> Copyright law is totally enforceable

Nope. Nobody succeeded in enforcing of the ownership of information, cos it's technically impossible

> what do you mean by that?

Predictable triumph of piracy. Businesses adapted and now we've much more convenient models like subscriptions. No serious big business is trying to only sell copies anymore, it doesn't work

> And I think Apple and android aren’t allowed to offer apps that are considered illegal already, right

Russia fights Telegram, nothing happened to it. Also u can read what happened in Turkey and during Arab spring. China has the most successful barrier, but it won't stand forever and will fall just like the Berlin Wall. Economics trump politics"
"Ad hominem is ""you're wrong because you're stupid."" I said you're wrong, and therefore stupid. Not the same thing. 

The banning of gold happened in a country with a ""functioning"" fiat currency. Fiat currencies are fundamentally lies. The only ""functioning"" they have is to what extent those lies are believed. "
"If it was that easy to change vote totals it would have happened by now. Unless you think trump was able to change more votes than Hillary and he’s actually the one the deep state wanted in office?

I’m confused though, I thought you said it was about money only? All I’m saying is politicians used it to make money and also gain power.  If you could do both at the same time without technically breaking any voting laws, that seems like the way to go.

Also imprisoning people doesn’t “cost” the govt employees anything. The tax payers foot that bill

I can tell by your last paragraph you’re about to start getting racist, so let’s just avoid that topic. 

"
You keep almost understanding, but you just keep missing the point. 
"You don't think vote totals have been changed in the past. That kind of staggering ignorance does not bode well for the rest of this conversation.

The drug war, and what it's been used to finance (let me guess; you didn't hear about that either), have always been about money. I don't want to shock you here, so have a seat before you read the next sentence: JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING GOVERNMENTS DO IS ABOUT MONEY. Money gets you everywhere. It IS power.

As it turns out, arresting and imprisoning a person costs quite a bit of money, your thoughtless reliance on ""the taxpayer"" aside. It is not practical on any level for long-term voter hijinks. Way too many moving parts.

But if you're actually using the drug war as a pretext to do a bunch of dirt at home and overseas, it's worth it. You can run weapons, drugs and people all over the planet. If you're smart, you can make people think that all that evil is actually a humanitarian project. Any money spent on actually running the government is money that can't be diverted to you and your friends. And that's just budgeted money. Did you know the Department of Defense has $21 trillion in unexplained ledger adjustments since 1998? Not $21T missing from government pockets - they can't explain where it came from, but they spent it. The last budget had a $6.5T adjustment on the Army budget. The Army budget was $128 Billion. More than 50X for an ""adjustment"" that will be cleared up later, supposedly. I mean, Mattis is auditing the DoD, so we'll find out. But isn't that interesting? The kind of thing CNN should maybe ask about.

You're making this way too complicated AND simple. Too simple because you're not taking into account what would be required operationally to do the thing you think will get the result, and too complicated because there are far easier ways to get that result. We live in a world of limited resources. Until we don't, coming at a problem like this from a different direction is not useful."
There is no point. The state is an illegitimate institution and will be destroyed. Everything else is obfuscation and ignorance. 
"Okay, vote totals in the US haven’t been changed known widely to the public. If it happened toss me a source I’d be very interested in that.

Imprisoning people does cost money. That’s why private prisons were started. The politicians donors actually profit from imprisoning people.

I’m assuming you’re familiar with how easy government contractors can funnel tax money into the pocket of big businesses. The large defense contractors like Lockheed make billions a year directly from the government. Those are private companies that then lobby government to get better contracts. 

It kinda just sounds like you always think you’re the smartest person in the room the way you present your points. No need to act condescending. 

I think we mostly agree and are arguing about semantics at this point"
Okay so once “the state” is destroyed is it just gonna be a free for all? You really don’t think it’s human nature to form societies? 
"> Okay, vote totals in the US haven’t been changed known widely to the public. If it happened toss me a source I’d be very interested in that.
 
I'm always confused by such requests. These things are not hidden, and I wouldn't accept a link from you.

> Imprisoning people does cost money. That’s why private prisons were started. The politicians donors actually profit from imprisoning people.

Do they profit from private police forces staking people out? From the DA prosecuting? There are so many moving parts in this plan. How do you not get that you're making a steam engine to take you to the moon when there's already a bus going there for $20? You don't need this elaborate plan, years in the making and implementation, to get the votes you want. Period.


> I’m assuming you’re familiar with how easy government contractors can funnel tax money into the pocket of big businesses. The large defense contractors like Lockheed make billions a year directly from the government. Those are private companies that then lobby government to get better contracts.

Yes. It's why I typed those words. It's my whole point. Why do you think you need such a retarded mechanism as a drug war to get votes years down the line? You can just sell drugs and weapons and move the cash through the US government. Cut out all the dumb legwork and take what you want the easy way.

> 
> It kinda just sounds like you always think you’re the smartest person in the room the way you present your points. No need to act condescending.

If you're going to present poorly-considered theories as real events, you are likely to get some abuse online. You'll be fine. If it hadn't already happened to me I wouldn't be talking about it."
https://youtu.be/jTYkdEU_B4o
Holy shit dude you do not understand my point. We are saying the same fucking thing you’re just too dense to get it
"That was actually a pretty interesting video. The only issue I have with these societies is it assumes everyone has a relatively equal starting position. Or if it doesn’t that means 99% of people will remain voiceless. 

In that society you imagine wouldn’t the “deepstate” or “the bankers” be the ones with 99% of the worlds wealth? Therefore they could afford to directly control the societies laws and police forces.
"
Consider the possibility that we are not, and that you aren't getting what I'm saying.
"The present powers of the world have all the wealth, but they also have the burden of maintaining that wealth and power, which arguably is why it is disintegrating so rapidly. Their basic value proposition is no longer tenable. They offer nothing except simple parasitism. And what are they doing with all this wealth now, trying to get stake in the new distributed trust framework in which they will be made obsolete, or desperately wasting that wealth trying to push it back? I think the state of the markets as they are now makes that pretty apparent.

A money completely outside the control of any political authority, decentralised and distributed amongst all people and able to be held and spent completely anonymously, was the last thing imho that was needed in order to make the aforementioned system a reality. Without that, you have the golden rule. Whoever controls the gold, makes the rules.

With a hard currencies though you must actually provide value to control the gold, you can't just print it to cover up your failures. If you can't cope at the top you don't get to stay there, period.
"
Okay. 
"So once this new society gets formed everyone decides to use one crypto and it’s all evenly distributed between them? 

That doesn’t sound realistic at all. “The end of the state” would happen very slowly and the people at the top would do everything possible to maintain power"
"Because that's not how people work, and absolutely not how large, varied groups like governments do things. You're talking about two separate issues here, that would best be handled separately. Are there consequences, intended or otherwise, that may benefit you? Maybe. But that's not an operation consideration if you're serious about results.

Imprisoning people who give you political headaches is a time-intensive and expensive process. Changing vote totals with a machine or just having people toss ballots they don't like is easy and inexpensive.

Which one makes more sense as a way to affect voting results? Black people are overrepresented in prison for a number of reasons, most of them pretty basic and very well established. Constructing complicated narratives when simple ones will serve is wasted energy."
"Hahah, that’s a pretty good ad hominem 

This wouldn’t happen in a country with a “functioning” fiat currency "
"Dude, it’s the same thing. If you put people in jail and give them felonies they can’t vote.

Those activists also influence other voters

Why are you so fixated on there only being one reason? You can do stuff for more than one reason"
Fair enough. I would agree with that
"> Huh? Copyright law is totally enforceable

Tell that to torrent users and usernet users.

> And I think Apple and android aren’t allowed to offer apps that are considered illegal already, right

Yeah, companies with public faces can't sell apps, but I can still sideload them on my jailbroken/rooted device."
"That sounds like an extraordinarily long-term plan with some major tactical holes in terms of actual application. And an unnecessarily complicated one, given the history of voting hijinks. Way easier to do that shit during the election.

It's about money. Everything else is secondary."
also can you explain why would everybody taut the blockchain \(last time it was the emperor xi jinping\)  when they actually want to ban it? what blockchains are they talking about because private blockchains are just better designed sql servers so the data is more accountable \- hardly a real invention.
"but why would government want crypto not to go mainstream exactly? how long can they keep it that way? last time i checked we have plenty of democracies so why would people vote for a government that stop technological progress? 

there will be plenty of countries that will allow crypto and profit. some can even adopt it as official currency. what mandate gives government agencies to attack crypto? will they attack other governments crypto?

this active government attack on crypto seems very very far fetched."
"But again, what time scale are we talking here? If you bought BTC in 2010, everything that's happened since made you unbelievably wealthy, assuming you bought enough. That it's some fraction of its all time high is interesting, but it doesn't change the fact that you bought at .00001 cents and sold at whatever (I'm aware that my numbers are horseshit, but it's part of my larger point in a way). It becomes a matter of degree, and I don't think that's a useful realm of concern.

And maybe one or another event would derail things for one or another coin, or maybe it wouldn't. But crypto as a whole is unstoppable, and there will be room for a number of platforms in the short (single-digit years) term regardless. Beyond that some sort of design/stewardship competency may be the limiting factor, but we're talking about large communities of smart, creative people. They will find a way to do what is required to thrive. They always do."
"And why do you suppose a government would want to ban crypto? Exactly the same reason. All fiat currencies are fucked. They vary only by degree. And they always end up at the same value; zero. The US didn't ban gold because of its stellar financial state at the time. Exactly the opposite. "
"> Nope. Nobody succeeded in enforcing of the ownership of information, cos it's technically impossible

And yet fines happen, people are jailed, companies have gone bust and lost or gained ownership, people and other companies comply with legislation and it is enforced by the courts...

At that point it doesn't matter if you think a pure model is the right model (whether that is the abolishing of intellectual property as a right, or bitcoin), what matters is reality and how people use or interact with something."
So it sounds like we were mostly on the same page ideologically. 
Tell that to the people who went to jail for pirating software....
I don’t necessarily disagree with you. I agree given enough time crypto will succeed. That’s why governments won’t bother banning it. They will just find a way to steal their cut
Lmao but you said the fact the government banned crypto caused the price increase. That was false
"> And yet fines happen, people are jailed

Sure. But it's not systematic. Bigger disputes just reveal again and again how shaky the whole ordeal is"
"I mean, would like like to compare statistics about percentage of people who go to jail for piracy versus... percentages for almost everything else.  The percentage of people struck by lightning for example.

The numbers are so astonishingly small that I consider that a complete and utter non-argument in favor of the success of outlawing piracy."
He's talking about dealing with antiwar activists, not as a tool to change voting results.
No, it was correct. *after* then ban was announced the price spiked even harder. I get that you're probably a state worshipping authoritarian idiot, but unfortunately your institution of choice is doomed. Perhaps you should go back to r/buttcoin. 
">Sure. But it's not systematic. Bigger disputes just reveal again and again how shaky the whole ordeal is

It's clearly enforceable though (even if a lot of the time it is not enforced, or otherwise ignored).  It also means that while there can be casual infringement, large scale or commercial infringement is generally seen as a liability and avoided."
"This is a quote from a Nixon aide. Draw your own conclusions 

>""You understand what I'm saying? We knew we couldn't make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin. And then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities,"" Ehrlichman said. ""We could arrest their leaders. raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did."""
Everywhere crypto was banned, the price rose significantly there. It simply doesn't work like that. 
"> Whether or not you agree with that morally, it's very likely going to be reality.

No its fucking not. You people are crazy. The casual user will in no way do all that shit just to use Bitcoin. People like ease of use. Thats the main reason most of the general public does not use crypto. Because its a fucking hastle to get and use and banks/paypal are way easier."
Yeah the war on drugs has been wildly successful too.  /s
How would they do that exactly? You would have to ban the internet
Mathematics does not respond to coercion. 
"> they could

No. They could temporarily reduce convinience of using crypto for their citizens, but nothing else. Bitcoin is unstoppable"
Infrastructure will shrink, but the remains will be stronger than ever
They don’t even need to do that. All they need to do is declare that using crypto is a taxable event.
Wow you should speak to Alex Jones 
"He's just another idiot who thinks somehow because crypto is based on math it's immune to everything and is the greatest thing in the world that can't be stopped by '''big government'''.

Just another crypt hipster."
Honestly that guy would have made an amazing shoutcaster for any legit organization
"This narrative needs to stop. It is simply wrong.

Governments (like the U.S. gov't) have already effectively hobbled the development of cryptoassets into money, by using tax law and AML/KYC laws to make it illegal to use them as everyday currency in practice (actually think through the implications of expecting people to adopt a new crypto coin as everyday money, if they now also have to track the basis of every little earn and then profit/loss on every little bit they spend) and dried up liquidity; stagnating coins like bitcoin in place as speculative vehicles only who's price can't stabilize.

Banning (or regulating) drugs is not the same as banning (or regulating) a high-network-externality-dependent good like a money token: the utility derived from using these drugs is not so much a function of how many other people also use them...unlike a money/currency, where its value can easily completely collapse (and it can't be a money at all) if even a significant portion of the population is afraid to use it because its illegal or is saddled with onerous requirements such as capital gains tax treatment."
This also applies to certain entities trying to block the stream of the real Bitcoin-BCH through their censorship, lies, slander, and dirty tricks.
Can't stop laughing.. Where did u get this
But we can't find water on the moon
If the governments want to succeed in regulating or banning Bitcoin then all they have to do is cut the internet and electricity problem solved.
lol they cannot!
Until you get that tax bill in the mail. 
The point is, that guy is doing such work that never is completed. :D 
True
This gets reposted so often..We need a crypto with this meme as the POW  Proof-of-futile-government-meme
"Same point could be made by showing:
-Any crowdshot from Consensus 2018
-Headshot of Samson Mow or Elizabeth Stark or Jack"
If they wanted to do that then they would have done it like a long time ago.
"This GIF is gonna get a workout over the years. This pretty well describes everyone with respect to trying to herd Crypto platforms/crypto as a ""community"" one way or another. Strangers in a strange land."
Please let's not become /r/bitcoin here
That's EVERYTHING the government sticks its nose in. 
I mean if they really wanted to they could. I think it’s more they are still deciding if they can use it to their own benefit first
All they have to do is make it illegal for banks, paypal and any financial institution to allow transfer of fiat to crypto exchanges and Bitcoin is pretty much dead. 
Who's upvoting these memes?
"They're under no illusion that they can shovel water back into the sea from a beach.

What they can do however is dump toxic and radioactive waste (BSCore/LN & Co.) into the sea/groundwater and then sell you bottled water still safe to drink and do your cooking/laundry with."
Are you dumb, they can't 
True!
dam son
Whelp. This is all theoretical, so we’ll see what happens. Interesting ideas tho
They could regulate it. The effectiveness of the regulation is yet to be seen
"Actually, a simple way would be to cut off FIAT/Bitcoin exchange (like making COinbase and type of sites illegal).  This would be pretty devastating short term, eventually it would promote the Bitcoin economy direct ecosystem and probably help adoption.

A second way would be to blockban IP/Mining/Bitcoin traffic, although I am not sure this is possible?  

Third way would be to have the state seize control of major mining operations (imagine if Chinese government seized Bitmain for example)."
If they ban it, it's going to go back to the same shit that it was: money for black market deals on the internet. I know you all want to get rich and hope it moons, and if this happens it will do the opposite. 
"Huh? A country could make it illegal to convert fiat to crypto. There are obviously ways to get around that, but it would deter tons of casual users who are necessary for the network.

It would also get rid of all the large scale industrial investors, which would probably crash the market "
There is a lot Governments can do to stall crypto adoption for 10, 20, 30 years or at least push it away to be adopted by other countries that don't regulate, while we fall behind.
"> They could temporarily reduce convinience of using crypto for their citizens, but nothing else.

You don't think thats enough?"
"Got a better explanation that in the face of common sense, empirical evidence, technical analysis and a clear user/business/market rejection certain numbnuts continue their destruction of Bitcoin they've been pursuing for years?

I don't. I'd wish I'd have one. But I don't. There's a point beyond which you can no longer attribute things to incompetence and you have to start attributing it to malice. We've crossed that rubicon years ago. It's time everybody realized this."
In reality... if you can get fined $10k or go to prison a few months for using something they deem illegal, progress can be halted by tyrannic measures.
Huge datacenters and mining farm respond to coercion...
You’re right. You can’t regulate bitcoin itself. But you can make it illegal to interact with it
Could you explain what you mean? How are people destroying bitcoin? (crypto noob here)
Ofc, it's not. I don't care what happens in the short term. Just like the Internet, open blockchains will change everything
"The thing is, all it has to do is be legal *somewhere*.  Then all the public transactions happen in that jurisdiction, then get mixed or converted to Monero or Zcash and converted back, and everybody just uses it underground.  And given that an UN member nation already has a cryptocurrency as legal tender, I think it's safe to say that that type of thing is not too far off from being not just possible, but extremely practical, just like the Bahamas and Swiss bank accounts of a few decades ago.

Whether or not you agree with that morally, it's very likely going to be reality."
Not it - their citizens' engagement with it and only temporarily. Bitcoin itself can't be regulated: u can't expand the supply, u can't hide or delete a tx (including Memo messages), u can't get a specific private key from the system itself, u can't deanonymize without external data etc
"> it's going to go back

Nope. Their wisest political opponents embrace it instead. Just like the Internet won't get back in time"
Throw you in jail if you had a bitcoin wallet on your mobile device or connected to your IP address. That would deter a lot of people
Impossible. It would stay as is or shrink to a tiny value, without money from the masses Bitcoin is nothing. The irony that Bitcoin is only valued in Fiat is astounding. Try living just on bitcoin without converting it to fiat.
"Simply the BEST explanation of the use of words. I’ve been following and invested for a long time here, and the number of people who throw out cloud and block chain is astonishing. 

Most have no clue, it’s such a FOMO thing until the use case for it all is figured out. 

So impressed with this."
wiiii bch great
