Why all this reference to North Korea and now Stalin? CNN and US would be equally if not better choice for the pick of word as CNN is known for its 100% fake news, no facts and all propaganda, and US government is not to be trusted for decades. Stalin was a dictator and an ass, but so is CNN and US government.

"The rhetoric goes both ways, of course. Another commenter here referred to Bitcoin Cash as simply ""Bitcoin"", while referring to Bitcoin as ""Bitcoin Legacy"".

Honestly, this seems to be the root of the issue with the name ""bcash"". It's a naming dispute, over the legitimacy of the ""Bitcoin"" name."
"The ""C"" stands for ""Cash""! :D"
"I understand. I meant simply ""worse than bitcoin *used to* perform"", as in: a year or two ago. Maybe I could have worded it better. I wanted to keep it short too."
This was good feedback. Shame it was underappreciated.
It's not good to be dependent on the difficulty to drop so miners want to come in. If they really supported Cash, they would continue mining when the difficulty went up. It's not happening. They mine Core continuasly. As soon as Cash difficulty drops they come in shortly and drop it again as soon as it's too hard. Not how you expect a Bitcoin network to be.
"I like it except the 'moving money worse than before'.  A direct comparison with Western Union is the send amount limitation is removed and pickup location limitation is removed - how is this worse than before!??

It should be ""moving money better"" and for Bitcoin Cash ""moving money far better"""
hahah!
"Time and time again I posted, ""Even after SW activates, users will have to create new SW compliant wallets, move their coins into them, (spending a ""normal"" fee first), and then finally use them again to gain the benefit"".

Time and time again I was berated for not knowing what I was talking about.

I mentioned nearly eight months ago that SW addresses will require a new type of address and possibly a new format.

I was downvoted to oblivion, called a ""r\/btc shill"" and ""clueless"".

I posted that Lightning channels will require two fees to operate plus a middle man fee for each transaction across the channel. I was wildly berated as an idiot.

Go ahead, Core. Prove me right again, because *I already know that's exactly how it is going to work.* Miner fees are going to be siphoned into hub fees, Lightning channels will be prohibitively expensive to open even with SW-secured coins ready to deploy, and not only will on-chain fees rise *even further*, those new middle man fees will become nearly unavoidable - and the alternative of using a ""legacy"" transaction will be *even more expensive than that*!

Bitcoin doesn't have a future for consumers, at least while this scaling plan is being followed. That price can continue to rise, but so long as the fees (denominated in **satoshi per byte**) also rise, the utility of Bitcoin is continuously being reduced. Anyone accepting Bitcoin has to be aware that fees are a significant overhead that limit the utility of a payment method. It is pointless to accept Bitcoin in a candy store, for example: the average purchase is smaller than the average network fee.

The common Bitcoin user has one option: pay an exorbitant fee to move your coins. SegWit introduces a second option: pay an exorbitant fee to move your coins into an address that gets a discount in the future. Heck of a choice!"
"That's a cop-out.

One thing is clear however. This whole crypto thing is a long ways off of being mainstream. We need clear communication between app developers and crypto developers if we are to make this stuff easy enough for gramma and grandpa to use.

the OP describes segwit and LN the same way the BS/Core developers say it will work, why do you think everyone is wrong? **more over lying?**

Be careful, the miners could take all your money before you have the chance.
Sounds like a bargain.  Wait, what is this alternative with 2 cent on-chain fees?  Sounds even better.
When you say 20% savings it seems more impressive. 
"Yes. Models of this network estimate that the average transaction would require six hops across it to resolve, meaning seven signatories to the transaction are required (sender, five middle men, recipient). Each additional signatory to a channel introduces an additional point-of-failure that could lock the channel for timeout by not participating, and increases the overall closing costs for the channel by increasing the size of the underlying Bitcoin transaction.

Of course, such a network doesn't exist in a vacuum and it is 100% likely at least one enterprising individual will charge a middleman fee for the convenience of using his globally reliable and highly-connected liquidity to transfer funds with less hops (and thus, lower network fees for the user, netting an overall savings)."
"The coins you already have need to be in a SegWit address to send a SegWit TX. You can receive coins from a SegWit address to any address.

Coins spent from P2PKH are not SW transactions, they're ordinary Bitcoin transactions. Coins spent from P2SWH are SW transactions.

---

*edit* Come on, folks. The guy is information seeking, no need for downvotes.

> **Correct me if I'm wrong but** don't you only need a Segwit address to receive a Segwit tx but not to send one?"
"> Most popular wallets already are Segwit compatible. If you're using Electrum for example all you need to do is update Electrum.

To my understanding this is wrong. I know that there is a very long list of wallets that ""support"" SegWit, but that is only political support and not actual technical support. Core wanted to seem like using SegWit is going to be easy. That also includes Electrum. To my knowledge Electrum does not support SegWit transactions yet. None of the Wallets can actually send SegWit transactions right now.

"
"That's something I find a little off, though: we had a whole difficulty adjustment to lock in the rules, and another one to activate them. Why is it so hard, then, to get information about the new rules and how to implement them? We have live SegWit transactions on the main chain, and they are misbehaving on the majority of explorers - and the ones that do work, either show ""nonstandard"" or display a cryptic, non-base58 address. What is a developer maintaining Bitcoin software to do about it? Wallet and service developers have had months of time to prepare, but there is an information drought with regards to *how it actually is used*. Heck, I just corrected someone today that thought the witness discount applies to transaction outputs sent *to* SegWit addresses - and the witness discount is a central component of SegWit. Honestly, I think it's the byproduct of misinformation - there's so much of it out there, that the information people actually need is getting buried, and wallet maintainers are caught between vociferous users and reclusive developers."
"I'm primarily an investor in Bitcoin, secondarily a service provider, and thirdly I'm a user. 

Segwit if it lives up to its hype and enables LN will at best give existing users the option to do more transactions, that wont grow bitcoin as an investment and I'm skeptical it will attract more service providers. 

I know what will attract more investors though and that's adoption of the bitcoin blockchain as an immutable ledger - the one thing that the BS/Core developers are working very hard at ensuring, access and adoption stays limited. 

if segwit succeeds at doing the one thing that BS/Core developers are trying to do and that is moving fee paying transactions to Layer 2 to reduce user competition to transact on layer 1 then as an investment Bitcoin is not going to meet long term projected returns as security model and utility will diminish as the block subsidies that secure the network diminish over time. "
I sincerely hope you're right about that, because it would be *something*. I'm not sure that it will actually be the case, but optimism is never a bad thing.

You are incorrectly using SegWit interchangeably with Lightning Network. SegWit does have quite a few [benefits](https://bitcoincore.org/en/2016/01/26/segwit-benefits/) that are not related to LN.

To list some:

* Malleability Fixes - benefits anyone spending unconfirmed transactions; has other benefits as well
* Linear scaling of sighash operations - makes increasing the block size safer
* Signing of input values - benefits manufacturers and users of hardware wallets and future IoT devices
* Script versioning - makes advanced scripting in Bitcoin easier (i.e. Schnorr signatures)"
"Not exactly how I understand it. For typical transactions you have to put a $8 to on-ramp and a &8 off-ramp so a minimum $16 LN fee assuming Hubs don't charge anything.  

the bitcoin is not yours while its not on a private key you control, it's in a LN Hub smart contract, that requires monitoring on your part. 

a strait up block size increase refuses the discounted fee from $8 per transaction to about $0,02 per transaction. 

on the idea of reducing the UTXO Segwit is making it bigger as bitcoin with a value less than $8 will soon become unspendable, while with a block size increase you can consolidate dust with up to a $0.02 value. "

Wait, bcash has LN now?  Excellent, glad you guys rethought everything.
You're comparing apples to oranges. LTC is fundamentally different than both of those coins. They had pre/insta mines and no hard caps and you already mention centralization. LTC was/is basically BTC with a fair launch. Not to mention that it's been around for a long time and hasn't had any major scandals.
The alternative is to take the really long time I mentioned it would take just to satisfy a random stranger's curiosity. It's his (or her) curiosity, he (or she) can satisfy it him (or her)self. I have no reason to lie and even a cursory browse of my most recent posts demonstrates that i have a consistent history on the topic.

BCH supporters have been saying all along that the miners will follow the profit. If anything this just proves them right. Meanwhile, BCore supporters are being told lies and are starting to wake up. I understand your cause for concern. One good pump on bch and btc is a goner. Notice how with the hyper inflation that BCH prices have been remaining somewhat stable between $600-$700? This should cause even more concern for you.
Forks and altcoins are fundamentally different things.

"nah bro. you didn't get the AXA memo? 

You are just supposed to Hodl strong. "
"build it and it will come, I expect AXA will now start investing in Bitcoin???

my fee projections are merely projections based on a transaction limit, but yes this is not growing bitcoin it just grows the number of transactions you can do. "
"How many Transactions per second does an 8MB block allow?  How about a 16MB block?  At some point you have to plan for the *future* of bitcoin -- Mass adoption to the tune of thousands of transactions per second.  This is simply NOT possible on-chain, while keeping a decentralized, secure bitcoin.

Second-Layer solutions allow this.  You may have money ""locked up"" in a lightning network hub, but is that really much different from just storing them in a hot wallet? Nope."
I remember this too, and can't exactly place the details. I'm pretty sure the issue was with network liquidity - more hops per channel also means more channels per node, and channels require available funding. Unequal wealth distribution ensures that there is a transaction value point at which routing becomes impossible for more than half of users, and that point is infeasibly low for real-world use. I think that's how it works, at least.
Some cryptos are already doing this.  The market has decided.
True, of course...

Please do show me in the mod logs where you see this
I guess you could always physically exchange private keys, re the fiat comparison 
Well, you're very correct that to establish a lightning channel is somewhat expensive and that indeed it only works for recurring payments, which is untypical for common uses. I'd just like to say that even though most people will not benefit from SegWit (contrary to popular belief), everyone will benefit from the reduced amount of transactions in the mempool due to the rare few users that do multiple recurrent payments. I count here things like inter-exchange transfers and potentially mining pools. This should help reducing the network fees as a result, but I doubt the effect will be much beyond a 5-10% fee (edit: reduction).
It's not surprising though. Everyone in the know could see that a major upgrade like segwit would require months of work for the wallet side to get up to speed. I don't personally expect things to happen immediately.
"Most popular wallets already are Segwit compatible. If you're using Electrum for example all you need to do is update Electrum. 

Why would you need to move your coins to a Segwit address to send a Segwit TX? Correct me if I wrong but don't you only need a Segwit address to receive a Segwit tx but not to send one? "
For the lightning network, could we have a massive p2p spiderweb of regular people who don't charge middlemen fees?  So you can send money to anyone in the network for free.  (Free aside from the handful of channels you will have to open and eventually close)
on chain fee is $10, LN tx fee is $8.  A $2 savings!  LN = less expensive!
"Soo... You are saying people holding Bitcoin as an asset need to spend and pay high fees before reaping the benefit.

Good luck activating those nodes, Core fuckers."
"So basically anything less than a certain amount that people were sent is lost. Right now it's around $5. I remember hearing of a guy who bought $10 weekly and sent it to his own wallet. He must be pissed knowing he's lost half his investment to fees.

The difference between Bitcoin fees and fiat fees is that with fiat you have a *choice*. Fiat's purest form is physical cash which you can hand to another person with no fees. With bitcoin, you have no choice other than to use the blockchain, so if you're not holding large UTXOs, then your money is literally disappearing to fees. Lightning network and other off chain solutions are less pure, requiring *more* trust. So it's all backwards. You can't send to lightning without using the blockchain, just like you can't deposit cash into a bank without handing it to the teller."

"I'm sure there were *some* low-functioning Core trolls who believed SegWit would provide an insta-boost, and I'm sure there were *some* technically accurate but largely misleading comments from certain people who knew better (like Greg). 

But I'd like to believe most people were aware that the discount would only come into play after funds had been moved to SegWit compatible addresses. So even if every bitcoiner started exclusively making SegWit transactions from the moment it activated you still wouldn't see any increase in capacity for a few days at least.

Bare in mind that if SegWit transactions are widely taken up over the next few weeks, and if that provides the extra capacity needed to reduce fees, posts like this (and the one Jeff has made about SegWit fees 24 hours after activation) are going to look really childish and stupid."

Right so you admit that you were arguing with trolls when they said SW would provide immediate relief. See how that works? 
And it's not going to be better with segwit.  My best guess is that in the future one will have to pay a high fee to move a segwit UTXO ... and a 4x higher fee to move an old non-segwit UTXO around.
