"As a long time mod of r/cc all of these recent narratives being pushed out are amazing / completely unwarranted. 

I’m the one who suggested the team swap over to new accounts due to doxxing concerns, this was done at the same time we downsized the team from low/inactive accounts (most low activity mods volunteered to step down) a conversation that took place over 1 month, my god had I ever known it would be used to fuel a web of conspiracy theories I probably would have made some alternative suggestions. At the time mod accounts from other subs were being compromised and it felt like an realistic threat, so much so that not long after it happened to one of our own who used it to put exchange referral links in the subreddit sidebar - we contacted reddit and sorted it out fairly quickly.

I’ve provided screenshots to refute the recent claims and they have been completely ignored by this community which is sad. You can check my comment history or DM me for more.

"This must be the dumbest theory and post yet u/CobraTheymos

I have been on The Google+ Bitcoin Community from day one. Which was over 5 years ago and was admin of it within months of it starting. I was brought in to The Facebook Bitcoin Group as admin by the previous admin almost 4 years ago.  I applied to be a mod in r/bitcoin in late 2016 and got in early 2017."
">You can spin it anyway you like, but r/bitcoin started with the exact same reasoning. We've all seen it before.

We are not r/bitcoin or r/btc, we don't mind if there's posts about those subs but posting about the same thing constantly is nothing of interest.

>No, no its not. You're changing the meaning of spam. Remember, you are not a moderator here, heavy handed tactics will not work.

Of course it's spam. If 50 people post about r/bitcoin mods in 1 day it's just spam, if not then Low Quality Content which is another one of our rules - and I know I'm not a mod here, I'm here as just another user.

>Of course not, you don't want people exposing your corruption, I understand. r/bitcoin had the same motives.

We are not corrupt in the slightest sense of the word and there's no evidence to suggest that. Have some proof before spouting such allegations. And even if you have a critique or suggestion, we openly allow users to post them in r/CryptoCurrencyMeta.

>I've already provided a method for you to investigate this, and as moderators honestly you would've already seen it, which is how I know you've been biased for a while now. Your job is to be the 'good cop' who talks about 'proper procedures', 'we're not a group for that', etc. to pacify those who get angry at what the 'bad cop' actors do

Whatever method you're suggesting, such as the methods used by r/btc mods are not going to work in r/CC. We are a general crypto sub for all cryptos and a very diverse community, not a sub that supports one coin like BCH. It's a very different atmosphere.

And posts regarding ""bad actors"" are completely fine, as long as they follow the rules. We've had many posts like that in the past such as exposés.

>. I.e. censorship, hiding posts, allowing certain posts to get visibility, and hiding certain others, and other underhanded techniques mastermined by the trolls who bought your sub.

Again, we don't do those things unless rules are broken. And there's not a chance in the world that sub has been ""bought"" just because your opinions are not in line with others."

">We are not r/bitcoin or r/btc

Irrelevant as the claim is that this is how censorship gets started regardless of 'who you are'. Thus you could be r/popecoin for all I care, the same tactics would be employed and would work if not warned against.

>the same thing 

Its NOT the same thing. If I get banned from there and post ""I got banned"", and then posted it again, and again, **that** would be posting the same thing. But if every user who did it posted that, it would NOT be the same thing, and hiding this would be censorship as you're deliberately trying to hide popular activity/sentiment while claiming to 'follow the rules'. The same rules you allowed certain communities like monero and ltc and probably others to flout. 

You may not realize it, but people have been watching that sub for a long time. The pattern is distinct and unmistakable. For whatever reason, through whatever policy, Dash specifically has been censored, censured and downplayed by official action/inaction on your part. Threads that **are clearly FUD** are still up if you search for 'Dash'. Either you guys clean up your act or it will become obvious that you are financed and supported by the same people that destroyed r/bitcoin.

>Of course it's spam. If 50 people post about r/bitcoin mods in 1 day it's just spam

NO ITS NOT. If 50 people post about r/bitcoin mods, AND 50 PEOPLE WERE UNFAIRLY BANNED BY THEM, **that's called NEWS not spam!** In that instance you then are aiding the censors and infiltrators. Beware.

>We are not corrupt in the slightest sense of the word and there's no evidence to suggest that. 

No evidence? How about the favoritism you play towards certain coins? The leeway you give the monero community specifically could only come about through nepotism. I see that one of your mods is an ACTIVE contributor to the xmr project, and even one of your own mods called him a 'xmr fanboy'.  If you don't think that's evidence for the possibility of corruption, well, you're kinda proving my point.

>Have some proof before spouting such allegations.

Right, because its not like this whole post was started by a former mod who claims you kicked him out. Like I haven't personally seen and felt your censorship. You guys shadow-banned me in the winter and I had to post a thread exposing Monero here in r/btc just to get any views. So you can stop lying to me directly now, as you obviously don't know who you're talking to. I've already DOCUMENTED the corruption of your subreddit, sir, please sit down somewhere.

>We are a general crypto sub for all cryptos and a very diverse community, not a sub that supports one coin like BCH.

And yet you subtly allow one coin (like XMR, or LTC) to receive favorable treatment, i.e. allowing them to FUD, shitpost, not censoring positive posts about them, not hiding negative posts etc. So I don't think you can objectively say that. Your sub clearly has been playing favorites for a long time now.
