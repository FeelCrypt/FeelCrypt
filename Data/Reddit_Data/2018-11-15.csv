BINGO!  I got statist BINGO!
I think he is innocent only because I hate the drug war.
"BINGO!  I got FreeRoss BINGO!

I swear, it's like these people are planted. They are literally the most dependable thing in the universe. You could set the NIST atomic clock to their showing up 1 femto second after anything slightly supportive of Ross Ulbricht is posted, and oh-so-casually sewing doubt, or guilelessly reminding us all of the supposed evidence that he tried to have people killed; despite not being convicted of that, and despite the entire investigation being a clear debauch of government subversion and malfeasance...the least of which would be to find out that they set him up or manufactured that evidence. "
"There is a large large difference in being a drug dealer and running one of the largest drug market places in the world and the punishment is way harsher for all organized crime dealers than small time drug dealers. 

"
"I'm not saying the FBI framed him for silk road. So most of your argument is irrelevant to my point. I'm saying it would have been easy to plant evidence suggesting that he ordered a hit.

And even though that part didn't go to trial it crusified him in the court of public opinion and make it much easier for the public to accept his extremely long sentence."
"Although I firmly believe Ross Ulbricht should not be in jail due to the manifest corruption of law enforcement and the fact he was clearly not afforded due process, the conversations between DPR and his deputies regarding the murder plots 100% occurred. They were not placed there by ""hackers""."
"Yes, I'll agree with you there, the FBI and all government agencies have been and are getting more and more corrupt... it's just disgusting.

I followed the two cases of the DEA agent and IRS agent who were found guilty of corruption.  These guys were not the sharpest tools in the shed and that's why their criminal exploits were caught.  And it just happened on a whim they were caught by some very awesome investigators in San Francisco... just barely caught these guys.  The two of them were completely independent of each other, not aware of the corruption the other was engaging in.  Which makes everyone who followed the cases think there are a lot more government agents guilty of more crimes and were smarter and covered their tracks.  The cases for this DEA agent and IRS agent never went to trial, so a lot of information never went public.  But from the publicly available information shared, these two guys were just really, really stupid.

The main reason I don't believe Ross' story about ""hackers"" is not only due to the overwhelming evidence against him and being caught red handed with an open latop containing detailed daily journals and backups in his night stand drawer dating back to times he claimed he was not administrator (well then he wouldn't have those backups on usb sticks then would he) -- not only that, but Ross claimed the 144,000 BTC on his computer were from his bitcoin trading ""expertise"".  However, he back tracked on that defense real quick when the prosecutors brought in some blockchain forensics experts and showed that all the coins on his computer came DIRECTLY from Silk Road, without any effort at washing or covering their source, just direct transactions from Silk Road to his electrum wallet.  The blockchain does not lie.  The defense dropped that argument real quick after this was brought up... and so what did he change his excuse to?  Hackers put the bitcoin on his computer.

Okay, first off, the blockchain does not lie.  Dates and payments cannot be forged or ""hacked"".  That's the beauty of Bitcoin - Proof of Work.

Second, no hacker in their right minds would frame someone and deposit $30 million to make it believable.  Maybe $20k, maybe even a few hundred thousand.  But $30 million, the entirety of Silk Road's profits over 2 years of operation, fully verifiable in the Bitcoin Blockchain?

Get over it dude, Ross was caught red handed, overwhelming evidence against him, and he still says ""it was the hackers mom!""

If he fessed up and apologized I would support him 100%.  But murder for hire with torture.  Fuck that shit.  But 5 years is still too much time -- that's being very generous."
"Worse than fascist. Corporatized and a tool to curb decedents of current standing status quo ideologies. 

Look at Snowden and whistleblowers, look at black/minority peoples. One blatantly to be annihilated(those speaking out and shining a light on governmental/corporate abuses), and the other to be used to fill prisons that are run as for-profit ventures. "
Yeah man I'm not one to appreciate empty accusations of fascism but I'm going to go ahead and say he's not wrong
Patriot Act
better dead than red.
"Because they already had him for multiple life sentences.  Plus he was an accessory to anyone else plotting murder on Silk Road. 

Had he just been peddling drugs and other illegal goods and laundering money, I'd demand his release as well, but he allowed services on the site that infringed upon the rights of free men, specifically life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, and accepted money for it. 

He is reaping what he sowed. "
"If they occurred he would have been convicted for conspiracy, a charge prosecutors salivate at the chance of hurling at people of the caliber Ross was propped up to be. 

The did not “100% occur”."
A website is a website he wasn't dealing nor was he directly procuring or directing he sellers.  He literally just ran some servers and created harm reduction forums.  
Violence for hire and CP was forbidden on Silk Road.
And it was legal to own slaves and illegal to harbor an escaped slave, fundamentally he did nothing morally wrong, the law is unjust.
Um no, just because you make metaphers doesn’t change the fact that drug consumption is illegal and distributing illegal things is also illegal by law.
No adults can choose to buy things and put in their bodies what they wish.  Just like a fat person at McDonald's or a diabetic person in a candy shop.  The shop isn't victimizing them they are choosing to victimize themselves and they are responsible for their own actions and habits.
Wow talk about moving goal posts.
"It doesn’t matter if there were victims, also because the people are selling the drugs to drug addcits, so they are the victims.

Regardless, building a market place for drugs is highly illegal and will get punished."
"No, we should jail rapists once we identify them, cos rapists will bring more net harm. I'm talking about market forces. Silk Road website is not a person, it's a force to support. Anything, not anyone. It's an important distinction

Even if u've some evidence  against Ross, sue him, jail him, but the site must go on

Ofc, authorities will choose again and again to shut down such sites, which will lead to completely new uncensorable Internet on the backbone of Bitcoin. I'm extremely pleased with Memo.cash and Oyo.cash and it's only the beginning of new era"
Child porn was banned from the silk road as were poisons and weapons.  That being said it was selling things people consumed themselves, there were no victims.  
r/totallynotsoviets
Okay let's expand on your analogy. Since you said anything that propagates Bitcoin is welcome, that implies we should support rapists if doing so leads to getting water to more people.
You weren't looking hard enough then.
So what, you also cant run a server selling child porn or Bombs, duh. 
"The murder for hires were actually covered pretty detailed in the trial.  Mark Karpeles of MtGox paid for the trial transcripts every night and uploaded them for everyone to read.  Should still be out there somewhere.

Mark paid for and uploaded the transcripts because Ross' lawyer tried claiming that Mark was DPR (Dread Pirate Roberts).  Mark didn't like that allegation one bit."
"No moral claims are made. It's an economic claim - Bitcoin provides options to escape worse imposed economic systems. Nothing more than a mercantilism. Anything that propagates Bitcoin forward is welcomed

Rapists drink water, nevertheless we should strife to providing everyone with water. Human beings who can act freely (not slaves, machines beat slaves in efficiency - that's the deep reason why slavery was abolished and that's why communism doesn't work) are too valuable to be left behind economically"
BUt whO WiLL BuIld mUh ROaDs
I hate to argue his innocence in this context, but i bet his intentions was not ending drug war but profit. Nevertheless his punishment was not deserved. If i was judge i would give him 2 years, and he would be out now.
And let me guess, you’re an under educated middle American?
I never claimed his intentions were ending the drug war. People ought to be motivated by profit, I think that's a good thing.

There is no such thing as a watchlist, there’s only a non-watch list for government officials.
"> hurt Bitcoin

Your vision of Bitcoin is incredibly short-sighted. It's not a corporate-friendly package for westerners to improve cards' efficiency. It's the life-saving technology for the poorest people on Earth who live under dictators

> too many do not want to follow the rules

Bitcoin is above jurisdictions"
You *think* Ross *knew* based on bullshit the FBI published that was debunked. 
Murder wasn't even a part of the case. Also all killing is wrong?
What about innocent untill proven guilty idea. I give 50% chance that he has been framed. 
">  Ross 100% knew in his mind he was ordering people to be murdered

according to what evidence?  a confession from Ross?  or evidence presented by the state?  because the state has been tried and found guilty of a massive amount of grade-A corruption in this case.  their entire body of evidence is deeply suspect and should not be considered."
"You realize the FBI has highly skilled hackers at their disposal right? The same FBI that got caught and sentenced with trying to steal his Bitcoin.

I don't know how anyone would be so sure he ordered up some people killed and actually believe it, when our own government found agents guilty of lying, theft and botching a case against him.

All trust in the case against him with the FBI should have been lost and the case dismissed.

If you know the history of what the FBI has done in the past, setting up someone to look like they ordered a hit is trivially easy for the FBI."
"Great song. Should've been a dubstep though. Like that ""fuck SOPA"" from back in the day."

"Listen, I understand the muder for hire charges were dropped, but I've read all the available evidence made public and followed the trial in its entirety.  Ross 100% knew in his mind he was ordering people to be murdered, not just murdered, but also tortured - he changed his mind about the torture at the last minute, but by that time the ""fake"" murder had already taken place.  The second time around, he thought he was paying to have 4 or 5 people tortured and murdered.  This to me is just wrong.  He never fessed up to any of the allegations despite the damning and overwhelming evidence against him - he continues to point the finger to mysterious ""hackers"".

Now, I'll give my support to freeing Ross, solely because I think 5 years is way too much time already, but I still want it known that what this guy did was flat out wrong.  In his mind he knew he was committing tortured murders on people he perceived as enemies.

As far as the Silk Road is concerned, I'm 100% on board with allowing people to trade freely in whatever goods and services they want -- as long as it isn't murder for hire and torture.  Ross needs to fess up and issue an apology - when that happens I'm sure there will be many more people supporting him - not just the bandwagon crypto fans.  Double life is sickening, even for someone who orders murder with a side of torture."
"This is probably the ugliest branch of the crypto tree.

Wanting to free a heavy criminal that you would never free otherwise, just because he increased adoption for Bitcoin. "
Fucker should be executed instead of freed.   From my understanding he is most likely an attempted murderer and undeniably an accessory to many more.
Wasn't he planning to hire a hitman to kill someone that turned out to be an FBI agent?
Having seen his mother, and heard the story he was not given a fair trial, nor was given a fair sentance nor treated fairly in any way.  Even if you think he did wrong he already has served more time than actual drug-dealers on the site.  He was merely a website operator and did not deserve a double life sentence for the audacity of trying to take the violence and organized crime out of the drug trade and push for harm reduction.  The audacity for doing more than the federal government in reducing drug crime and violence.  
This is a reasonable comment.  So I'm upvoting.  But I just don't see how any thinking person can outweigh in their mind the likelihood that Ross committed these attempted murders, than that he was subverted by the government, and that the evidence which we've all read, is trustworthy in any way.
Acquitted
Hurt bitcoin? Um no sweetie silk road helped propel bitcoin to the spectacular success it has become

Because someone is totally willing to off a dictator for $22 of Bitcoin... /$ ef~off. it was satire.
Five years for your ratio of ignorance to audacity is a touch light. 
Ross is a hero, not a criminal. 
Here we go again.
"Ah more evidence and comedic material for future generations to laugh at us about. 

Future someone: “so these are the idiots that called themselves the bastion of freedom, liberty, and democracy? Hah”

The worst part about this, even clemency isn’t enough, judges that hand down these sentences need to be prosecuted in return tbh. "
Try reading next time..
Your understanding is very wrong then. Read the article. The charges were dropped
