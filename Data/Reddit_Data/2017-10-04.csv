If they can't convince the community to use the coins they mine, they're wasting electricity for nothing.
That is a risk. However, Luke-jr is no longer mining and most miners would probably care more about their lost profits.
Currently EDA helps defend against 51% attacks. 51% attacks are primarily possible if the difficulty is so high that other miners abandon the chain. At low difficulty 51% attacks are also possible, but much more expensive, because the competing hashrate is much higher.

Ugh, no.  Just... no.
Concur. I donâ€™t think that plan has any traction though.
No. They make money by selling BCH as quickly as they can after mining. If BCH goes to zero, they just go back to mining Core coin.
The money is on the table if Bitmain doesn't get it (mine it), someone else will.
What if they don't care cuz they sold them immediately 
Likely. The same thing was said for ETH though. And I wouldn't put it past Core to run BCC classic just to muddy the waters.
">They should definitely support that

Why would they support it if it has a lower return than the current situation?"
The bigblock miners would lose all trust from exchanges and merchants. The bitcoin ecosystem implodes into a complete civil war and people flee to altcoins.

Exactly, which is why miners should not have a say in the rules of bitcoin. You could release a new client, if the miners don't follow, you're in trouble. Either you accept they can veto any changes, or you put up with the pain and accept the fact that they can bully you. 
I bet it will go smoothly when the code is available.

Why? because BTC diff algo is broken.

Meaning BTC can die because of it too. (nov?)

"
"There is a huge difference between untested code related to bug vs untested code related to the wrong algo. EDA code works perfectly as intended... it's just a flawed logic that creates oscillations in hashrate. The same way SegWit code works but it's bad to have signature separated.

The first test we should do is find an algo that would prevent the problem... then make sure there is no bug in the implementation."

Sure, and as the price differential gets larger, the oscillations become larger. What happens if the price drops further?

Yep, but mining more and more coins devalues the currency. Its like governments printing more money."
"> EDA requires a small percentage of ideological miners to forego chasing profits to dampen the swings.

LOL. Sounds like Satoshi's vision to me!"
Bitcoin is based on selfish miners who follow the consensus rules to maximise profit. When a miner mines at a loss, or turns away profit, it is _not_ working as intended. 
"Why would anyone want to move back to the old difficulty algorithm, assuming you mean the 2016-block only adjustment? That design doesn't provide the ability for the network to stay stable unless it retains a large amount of the hashing power keeping it stable at its current difficulty. This was observable when BTC block times suffered while ~50% of the miners switched to BCH.


In order for users to be attracted to the network it needs to fulfill use-cases and provide a good user experience. Both of those are a hard sell to users/services when they experience erratic transaction times.  


I've even advocated for BTC to adopt a new difficulty adjustment as it is a pure upgrade. If a state-level actor like China decided to aggressively go after mining farms suddenly they could severely drop the current hashrate. It wouldn't kill BTC, but it would definitely affect the network experience, especially if multiple state-actors participated. A more adaptable difficulty adjustment would render this attack useless."
2016 block-period adjustment is simple, but it doesn't deal with competing currencies of the same proof of work algorithm. If you have a simple algorithm that can work in this competing SHA256 environment I'm all ears.
"BTC will not have ocsillation if hash power drop it will need 2000 blocks to adjust.

You will be reminded that problem in November.

As you said all altcoin that use this algo died."

That was an arbitrary constant, just like 1MB.

Barrier breached!"
You can easily simulate the game theory aspects offline on your home computer, no need to set up a testnet. Deadalnix has already done that for his proposal. The hard part is to make sure your scenarios are fully realistic.
"The problems with the EDA concern ""adversarial"" behavior.  So debugging is not a matter of analyzing algorithms for ""correctness"".  It's more like proving that there are no effective attacks.  This is (somewhat) akin to proving a crypto algorithm secure.  It is harder than proving a program to be bug free.  (It is not possible to prove that an arbitrary program is bug free, only a limited subset of possible programs can  be proven, and then only if there is a precise definition of correctness.)

Lol, not gonna happen.
The fact exists that there will always be a massive chunk of hash power that exists outside of BCH that could be pointed at any time. Not only is BCH at huge risk for a 51% attack but no matter what you do with EDA it'll be exploitable due to this.
And no miners will mine the new chain as EDAs inflation is the only thing keeping BCH miners around. 
Miners want those coins with hyperinflation, exchanges will list anything as they already listing shitty ICOs with no value, and traders trade them. Before changing EDA with hardfork better to come up with the new name(s), desirable without bitcoin word.
"100% agree with all you said and I'm also just concerned that it gives detractors something easy to criticize because it makes BCH look a bit amateurish. In my view it is 100% superior tech to BTC except for the crazy variance in block times. BCH can win on merit alone over a longer timeframe and I think it has a significant chance of doing so. But this is a like a leak in the bottom of the boat and it needs to be fixed quickly.

Given that BCH does not have a single dev team owning a reference client what is the process necessary to get agreement on a new algorithm and push this forward?

I think if we could address this quickly and perform another successful hard fork it would be super bullish for BCH because it would demonstrate that the coin and its community are functional and serious about long-term viability."
I'm all for that, just worried about the people in this thread that seem to want BCH to go back to the BTC difficulty adjustment algo - which would probably doom BCH imho.

"I think we need to ask why aren't miners mining it when it is less profitable, while there are a lot of miners mining segwit when it is less profitable.

Weird how BTC is not sufferring from the same oscillations though.
Tell that to your devs ðŸ˜…
I also think it will never fully die.  Somebody somewhere will keep mining it and it's already on exchanges.  
To be fair I don't think satoshi really imagined the multi-coin universe we'd be in today. Miners enforcing good rules on the chain really does work if there's only one chain in town because they want to protect the value of their coins, or even if they sell for fiat right away, they want to protect their investment in being able to mine valuable coins. In a world where miners can switch coins willy-nilly with the same hardware, there's way more incentive to mine a coin straight into the ground for a profit, and it complicates the incentive structure significantly.

It's a mistake to trust miners to do anything other than what's best for themselves
On testnet you could even replay hashrate fluctuations as we see on BCC now, just use 1/millionth of the power or something.
Youâ€™re mixing concepts from CS for dummies. Not super relevant here.
"I agree, I just say that so far there were no solid data on how much actual users are affected. Looking at the graph and making decisions based on _that_ is pure speculation.

My wider point I guess is that the effort spent on fixing the EDA and a new hard fork would probably bring better returns if instead it was spent on improving Bitcoin Cash popularity."
"It's starting to seem like that was exactly the plan.

Do you think it's a coincidence that BCH was primarily promoted by miners? I don't. So far BCH has been a gold mine for miners and a money pit for everyone else.

"And my point is, that isn't possible. Any ""fix"" will just open up some other vulnerability."
BTC would be a much safer coin if it had something like the EDA.   If china shuts down their miners BTC will get throttled down to 2 blocks per hour for three weeks.

If you believe bch will be the dominant coin, you can get more bch by mining a more profitable coin and trading it for bch.
It's somewhat subject to the prisoner's dilemma problem. Unless the miners agree to act in concert, a miner which doesn't follow profitability is just throwing away money.
">The miners won't mine a chain that's less profitable.

If segwit2x is listed as BTC then Segwit2x will be most profitable coin.

The segwit1x minority fork will have lost nearly all hash rate support and the difficulty algo will ensure its death (unless HF, or maybe some core dev will sue segwit2x dev somehow hahaa..)

Note: I don't care much about segwit2x and segwit1x but the bitcoin naive difficulty algo will have consequences that was my point."
Coinbase, bitpay shapeshift etc alone have millions of users, you are delusional if you think a bunch of dudes on a censored forum or a tag on their Twitter handle can compete with that.

We do not know if it is arbitrary or not. Maybe Satoshi calculated somehow or had some kind of reasoning why it should take exactly 150 (or so) years to mine all coins.

Except that we have evidence of this scenario happening, and it doesn't play out the way you think.  It's actually comical.  BCC has a ton of hashrate right now (close to 50% of bitcoin), and yet where is the value?  Why hasn't the value ""seemlessly transfered"" over to BCC?

The reality is that depite a huge amount of hash power, the value of BCC *is tanking*.  It's hysterical that you think that hashpower magically means the value will shift to a new chain when we have evidence that proves you wrong.

Look right in front of your own eyes man!  How much more clear can this be?!?"

"> If you just want to tear all the hashrate from Core based on profitability alone

Not possible. The enemy has unlimited fiat to subsidize their miners so they can mine segwit at a loss. This is part of the reason why EDA exists - its not a level playing field"
"Regardless, it proves that ~~your~~ /u/pitchbend's explanation is invalid.  He said that when hashrate moves chains, it ""seemlessly transfers"" the value with it.

I'm saying that /u/pitchbend is spreading FUD.  What he said is objectively false.  Hashrate does not dictate value.  Hashrate *follows* value.

*edit: linked to wrong user*"
"Sure. But at equilibrium, hashrate should be about proportional to price. So targetting 10 minute blocks but accepting longer blocks without difficulty adjustment might have been reasonable. Have a smooth switchover zone rather than a severe one. Then miners might switch more gradually as profitability flips.

If you just want to tear all the hashrate from Core based on profitability alone, you probably want to tweak things a bit so that it stays about 10% more profitable or something like that rather than just make it easy to mine many blocks for almost no effort. I don't think this is likely the best strategy though. I would say that we need to compete on utility rather than bleeding block rewards so enough hashrate to keep the coin alive and functional would be fine until Core coin kills itself.

"I don't think ""fairly slow"" was an option on a network where we are competing for hardware. Miners that are heavily invested aren't likely to mine at a loss for very long."
"Game theory shows that the winning strategy for reiterating prisoner's dilemma is to tit-for-tat (First cooperate, then reciprocate).  This reaches Nash equilibrium because you both know that cooperation is more beneficial mutual strategy than to both cheat. Trying to out cheat the other increases the risk and eventually just leads to both cheating.

It is actually a bit more nuanced though and I don't want to go into too much detail. When you have a population of individuals, the winning strategy of prisoner's dilemma, there are two very successful strategies. The first is to cheat always.  The second strategy is tit-for-tat (Cooperate with other cooperators and cheat with other cheaters).  Which strategy is more successful is dependent on the proportion of the population that is pursuing each strategy.  In a population of mostly tit-for-tat, the cheaters won't do well.  In a population of mostly cheaters, the tit-for-tat won't do well.

The interesting thing is that the prisoner's dillema is very applicable to evolution. Some species evolved to always cheat (loners), and others evolved to tit-for-tat (social groups).  Altruism is believed to have evolved due to the success of tit-for-tat."

"The problem is, the EDA is designed to attract mining at any cost. When the halving happens, this will mean it has to drop the difficulty even more which means blocks will be being found even more quickly than they are in low difficulty periods now.

From my memory price begun increasing during or just before this period.
At the last halving there wasn't another coin competing for the hash power. 
">and multiple iterations.

Correction: infinite iterations.

This is because with a finite number of iterations you should cheat in the last one. But if the participants will all cheat in the last one and there's no changing that, then on the penultimate one you cheat as well.

And so on until you realize you should cheat from the start.

If you know the number is finite but you don't know when it ends I'm not sure what is the best strategy. "
"Source for ""BCC has a ton of hashrate (close to 50%)""?"
[deleted]
Yes, it could do with something like it. But hopefully better implemented. BCC may show the way.
Interestingly, the prisoner's dilemma does stabilize around cooperation when there is open communication and multiple iterations. That is why I expect the miners to cooperate and find a solution in the long-term.
They can be replaced, even if they are the majority of bitcoin miners. There are plenty of altcoins with different proof-of-work to choose from. If people think miners will just liquidate Segwit2x after a month and go back to the Core chain, which exchanges and merchants are going to bother supporting the fork?
Relevant username^^^
Which is like.. 2 hours?
">The bigblock miners would lose all trust from exchanges and merchants

Does that matter though? They have a monopoly, they can't just be replaced.

Also, why would they lose trust? They're only following their own economic interest which is supposed to be how it works, any negative side effects are defects of the system."
Miner profitability is a function of difficulty AND market price. Even if difficulty goes up, long-term confidence in the coin will drive adoption and increase price and increase miner profits if they hold on to their coins.
It would ruin their reputation and likely kill all support for blocksize-increasing hard-forks.
They have to wait at least 100 blocks.
He wasn't referring to EDA, but the default difficulty adjustment in bitcoin instead. 
Again, there is a difference between looking at graphs/block explorers and actually being affected by unstable block times in real life.
Thanks this really helped me understand it :)
But the community isn't singular, and they don't need the support of the entire community, just enough to sell the coins they mine. That is my point. There is already a big part of the community unwilling to use their coin, and they don't care, because enough are. They don't give a shit about what the community wants as long as they can make a profit, and ultimately all of them can make a profit even after alienating everyone by just going back to mining BTC. All these forks are just additional profits they can intermittently milk from those who still trust them.
It's a MASSIVE risk
So die if you do, die if you don't. Either way bch is fucked.

The current EDA dilemma isn't caused by miners gaming the system, its simply them switching chains to what is more profitable, but it causes wild swings because its very difficult for the miners to adjust manually, otherwise there are other factors like price (which is now dropping).

"> You will be reminded that problem in November.

You don't understand miner incentives if you believe this to be true.

The miners won't mine a chain that's less profitable.  The legacy chain will be the most profitable since it's the chain that has all the users and all the value.  If some of the miners do fork off to a 2x chain, they'll come running back when they realize it's more profitable to mine the legacy chain.

RemindMe! 2 months ""Which chain is most profitable to mine?"""
There are other difficulty algorithms that act fast and haven't been gamed.
But the point is, the graph means the vast majority of users ARE affected. If your transactions were timed in such a way that yours were fast, that's fine. But for the other 95% of users who it isn't fine for, that's a huge problem for BCH. The coin depends on the majority's experience, not any one user.
The current EDA is creating a huge bonanza for miners. That was never part of the plan.
If difficulty is too high, we could die from chain death or 51% attacks. If difficulty is too low, we could die from inflation. The best way forward is to improve the difficulty adjustment to avoid the wild oscillations.
For sure. They would do it just for spite.
Original bitcoin difficulty adjustment doesn't have an EDA. 
[deleted]
But you can test the situations those would incentivize given that there are a limited set. 
They do have a say by mining the coin they think has or will have more value. They are who vote, it's clearly in the whitepaper which all of us read before ver investing or becoming involved with btc. 
The are bugs in the EDA as well: for example, the normal difficulty re-target still assumes a constant difficulty for calculations.

I don't fault them, but the problem is that auto switching exacerbates the issue. It causes difficulty to overshoot adjustments for both increasing and decreasing.
"While true, your statement doesn't factor in short term vs long term profits. A miner who believes that BCH will be the dominant coin in the end might mine for less short term profit now so as to improve the long term profitability. 

Regrettably that doesn't appear to be happening, since the hash-power valleys are getting deeper, indicating fewer miners during the least profitable times. "
Or it would take too long to adjust to profitability and it would cause the price to plummet.
They only make money if BCH continues to have value ...i hope they are doing this for the long run, and not to do fast money!!!

It's not alarming for the miners.  They are getting tons of block rewards from mining near empty blocks, selling them off as they earn them.  So ViaBTC and Bitmain have no desire to end the EDA, they are using it as a method to take make money off the people dumb enough to buy BCH.

How true is this, though? There's very little activity on Bitcoin Cash chain right now. For example, I don't even notice any variations in block times. So, some tx might take a bit longer, big deal...

This problem will auto-solve itself when Bitcoin Cash becomes more popular at the expense of the legacy chain. It could be argued that unstable block times make it harder for Bitcoin Cash to become more popular, but without any tangible data it's just a speculation.

I think the reason Satoshi picked that particular algorithm is precisely because any faster-reacting algorithm can be gamed. And the more complex it is, the harder it is to analyse and see the ways it can be gamed.

There is a risk that the fix would actually make things worse if people find a better way to exploit EDA because of it."

"Why do we need an EDA?

Isn't mining profitability independent of block times.

Say all of the sudden 50% of the miners disappear. Block times would double but so would your share of the block reward. So miner profitability is purely based on your efficiency relative to the current difficulty. This is under the assumption that the price remains constant. If the bitcoin price and the difficulty was the same, solo mining would have the same profitability of mining on a pool with 0 fees.

I thought bitcoin cash would do a one off difficulty reduction then adjust the difficulty every 2016 blocks like bitcoin?"
Maybe the simple fix, lowering the difficulty retarget period?
I thought the fork should have put the difficulty down to 0, and made to work its way back up. Would have worked for a time, but since it share POW with bitcoin people gravitate to whatever is most profitable. And if btc is more profitable, then there goes the incentive to mine the other. 
Oh my god! Sell! Sell! Sell!
What is EDA?
"Can we get that active on testnet soonâ„¢?
"
"You really think a whole new diff algo doesn't need months of testing and optimizing? 

Look how EDA worked out."
The suggestion is not to discard it but to replace it with something less drastic.
That can still be gamed.
If you want a simple solution with good adversarial testing, borrow one from an alt-coin with GPU-based pow. Alt-coins have to compete for hash power and their prices fluctuate quite a bit, just like BCH does.
"Sshh don't point out reality to /r/BTC they don't take well too this truth. 

But hey my short's paying off. "
">Downward spiral it seems...

Ironic. The EDA could save others from the death spiral, but not itself. "
That's exactly why OP is proposing a fix
i agree. it seems like it was a mistake to trust the miners to responsibly manage difficulty adjustments, so as not to hurt the coin price. i think we shld remove unnecessary trust from the system, and fix the difficulty adjustment at the protocol level soon. 
Cool, when's it due to be deployed?
No user will admit BCC classic, That makes BCC classic worthless, then miners will leave.
Maybe I'm missing something here, but how are you trying to make core a Boogeyman in this situation when they're developing on a completely different chain? Core has nothing to do with BCH, which I thought was the whole point. The fuckery on the BCH chain is solely the result of the benevolent miners the BCH crowd championed playing games with the adjustment algo for their own short term benefit. This is a big reason why many of us involved in Bitcoin don't really care what miners want, because we operate under the assumption that miners are greedy and will do what is in their best interest, not necessarily what is in the best interest of users.
"> EDA makes it possible for a malicious actor to maintain that minority chain with a trivial amount of hash power

It will not create another valid coin.  Nobody wants hyperinflation Bitcoin Cash, nobody will accept these mined coins. no exchange will list them."
EDAs allow miners to manipulate the block reward. This causes inflation as 12.5 BCH are often generated every 3  minutes when in fact it should only occur every 10 minutes. 
"It's not possible to ""test"" a system that has to respond to strategic moves.  One can best ensure that obvious strategics with bad results can be blocked, not other strategies that some smarter person comes up with.  So don't expect anything to be ""verified solid"" any time soon.

"There alread y is a proposed solution : https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/73bknp/new_difficulty_adjustement_algorithm_of_bch_is/
"
"I don't think that ETH/ETC is especially good at diff adjustment. There are many other algorithms out there.
"
"It needs to increase drastically should hashrate increase drastically. The problem isn't that EDAs are too quick. It's that difficultly only drops quickly but doesn't increase quickly.

It's a very simple code fix to just revert the EDA commit and then change the difficulty readjustment frequency from 2016 blocks to something like 100 blocks. "
"Miners follow profitability. It's possible someone will try to keep ""BCC classic"" going I guess but price would be low."
Emergency Difficulty Adjustment
We need to adjust the block reward so it's approximately constant per unit time.
EDA is working as intended. Let's keep it that way.
its too late miners have premined lot of coins, holding does not help.
I'm not sure we need the EDA fix before the Nov hardfork, but it sure would give BCH a nice push when one sees how increasingly crazy the BTC side is becoming :)
i think it is going to be too late if  the fix is deployed after the November 2X fork, The oscillations in the current EDA seem to be getting bigger and probably are being manipulated by Bitmain!  i hope they know what they are doing, but November is weeks away and BCH needs to be viable by then!
"I **fully** agree.

We are inflating the money supply too quickly with the EDA. The block times are unpredictable, and it's just not an ideal picture.

I found myself becoming a less enthusiastic about Bitcoin Cash because of how the EDA is operating.

I know it can be fixed. And this post is spot on.

Fixing the EDA needs to be made an **emergency priority**, to be done within a few weeks."
"Completely agree, EDA is bananas.

It will be hard to convince miners, though."
"/u/jessquit I agree the EDA needs to go, keep in mind that any hard fork we attempt while Core is a player in crypto will result in 2 chains (though the 2nd may die in the mid term) as EDA makes it possible for a malicious actor to maintain that minority chain with a trivial amount of hash power. 

Also if I'm not mistaken the BCH main chain and BCH minority chain would not have replay protection against each other."
"Genuine question. What is the goal for fixing EDA ? Iâ€™ve heard different answers:

1- Ensuring miners profits are stable
2- Ensuring a fixed block finding time
3- others"
If Segwit2x takes over then why not just let BCH die off? What benifit does it serve at that point as a separate coin if Segwit2x successful increases the Bitcoin block size?
yes, it should be tested very well, then once its verified solid, deployed right away.
"Hi /u/deadalnix,

Has any miner/pool operator shared their opinion/stance on the incoming EDA-fix hardfork? Would you mind sharing?

Apparently users and devs are in, we need to know what miners think too.

"
"What will be interesting to see is once a solution is proposed, how quickly it can be agreed on and implemented.

Will be a good test case for BCC cohesion."
"I second time big time!

This is a major issue now,"
"Ethereum/ETC have a lot faster diff changes. This is what BitcoinCash needs urgently.

Currently, the network incentivizes miners to game the network."
The EDA is just a bit too drastic. It triggers just fine, but the reduction in difficulty is about 2-4x as extreme as it needs to be
"I appreciate your concern.

50+ blocks mined this last hour alone, this is very alarming.
I could't agree more.  The EDA is just bleeding the life out of Bitcoin Cash with cycles of rampant coin creation followed by hour long blocks.

"Really want to keep hodling, but feels like miners are killing the goose. Gatling gunning blocks and selling instantly, with the exception of Jihan's two addresses.

Been opting to take BTC as payment while mining BCH the last 2 EDAs. If we can go sideways for atleast two months or go back to 0.175 and stay there, I'd take BCH and continue to Hodl.

Not sure if this is helping the merchant adoption cause when transactors will be weary of hodling balances for fear of losing buying power."
"http://fork.lol/pow/difficulty

BCH is dying a slow death.  

Security (hash rate) for BTC is rising while it's declining for BCH.

At a low enough hash rate, why would you pay much for BCH?

Keep in mind, the hash rate NEEDS to keep declining in order to attract miners.

Downward spiral it seems..."
What is the issue with changing the difficulty every block?
Jihan & Roger & CSW will never allow an EDA change. Simple as that. Sorry for the bag holders.
Look at the hindsight of Big Blockers. Been warning about the EDA from the start. But only now that its gotten out of control you realise the problem. Same thing is gonna happen with the big blocks, they will become a pita and you will realise crypto is not just butterflies and unicorns. But only IF bitcoin cash blocks get any bigger, this would require users which takes alot of time to get and BCH is not off to a good start. Good luck.
There is no way to fix this, if you go toe to toe with a significantly higher hash rate coin, with the same pow, you're gonna have a bad time.
"It needs to adjust the difficulty upwards slowly when more hash power arrives on BCH.

But remember we are competing against Bitcoin Legacy chain for hash rate. Miners switch when it's more profitable to mine. Every time the EDA kicks in we take a large chunk of hash rate from the legacy chain. Their chain slows down and the mempool blocks up. This has CoreStream very worried that miners are leaving their chain. It's a gradual flippening. More hash rate arrives each time this happens. This is how Bitcoin Cash kills off the legacy coin.

The inflation is only temporary. Remember there's still only 21 million coins ever. All these blocks being mined quickly means we will reach the next block reward halvening more quickly. This means more scarcity and a higher price. At the moment the extra liquidity is good for the coin. This is a currency remember. There needs to be enough of it for people to spend and buy things. Users are still trying to figure out how to retrieve their Bitcoin Cash after the fork. It's pretty complicated. A bunch of it is also locked up in places like Coinbase etc. So there's only so much available right now.

Contrast this with the legacy chain with so many people ""hodling"" their coins. This creates artificial deflation. It's like an ongoing ponzi scheme. Price goes up to 5K. People sell and it tanks to 3700. Then they buy in again at the low point and do it all over again. There's no way a real currency can handle such huge swings. One day you can buy 5 computers with your Bitcoin, next day only 3. People need to use it as a currency for it to grow. Sure hold one or two coins as saving or investment, but spend to get Bitcoin working and growing. The more people that spend and use, the more merchants support it. Then it becomes more widely used and a world currency. Then we fire the banksters and governments with their money printing schemes and inflationary fiat which means money never holds its value and entire generations are enslaved in debt, generation Y and Z can't buy houses or get a university education without huge debt."
Hardfork will be needed to fix EDA, and this will create another coin as EDA designed for minority chain to survive.
Also, the faster blocks are causing depreciation via inflation that is larger than adoption.
But, what if, in the chaos of Segwit/2X vs 1X, BCH ends up being the last Bitcoin standing?
"I think yeah... if it has been tested, deploy it.

I prefer targeted block height hardfork. "
"Have predicted this situation before.
https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/71qzo0/the_eda_is_a_serious_issue/
Only few people care about this that time. Talking about EDA's problems people will troll you as a Core supporter. 10 days later world changed. LOL"
Sorry if stupid question but what does EDA stand for?
I fully agree, what are the alternatives?
"The EDA protects bitcoin cash from sudden drops in hashpower, BTC 1x and 2x don't have that.

I'd say keep the EDA unless it is replaced by something else that will protect against big drops in hashpower - since there is still the risk that China will shut down the miners."
"If we're going to have this conversation here, then some detailed analysis of mining needs to be included. Not just, ""oh, there are oscillations and unpredictable block times"". 

"
"I think an easier solution would be to add an upper limit on the EDA.

Right now it only adjusts down so add a measure to adjust up. If the avg block time of the last 4 blocks is less than 7min increase difficulty 10%, once adjusted wait two blocks before checking is adjustment is needed."
"EDA got added to UAHF at the last minute, with these results

Is it smart to push out another hard fork in a rush, with even more complicated rules?  

Where is the simple solution with good adversarial testing?"
Hit up Blockstream/Core and see if they would program up something that actually works for you guys.
"This is my reply on the post you linked to re: inflation on BCH:
___
It's not that hard to do the math actually.

According to cash.coin.dance there have been 3992 more blocks mined on the Cash chain than the Legacy chain.  At 12.5 BCH/block that's 49900 extra BCHs mined in the last ~60 days.

Or you can go to coinmarketcap.com, it shows BCH 16,653,338 and BTC 16,603,525 for a difference of 49813.  Same story.

49813 coins in 63 days since the fork means 830 bch/day are being mined in addition to the 1800 coins expected.

1800 coins/day (normal expected BTC output) represents 4% inflation.  2630 BCH/day represents 5.84% inflation, which is **46% higher inflation** than the expected 4% inflation.  Burning through the remaining coins 46% faster than expected is **not insignificant.**

I think this is not good.  Moreover the wild swings in block output is not conducive to a good user experience, and probably affect security negatively as well.  It needs to be addressed, sooner not later.

Before someone calls me a concern troll [BCH PLS](https://jessquit.threadless.com/designs/bch-pls/mens/t-shirt?color=royal_blue)"
Sorry about that. So it was /u/pitchbend who was spreading FUD, not you.
"They're not stupid. If they destroy Bitcoin Cash for short-term profits, what good will that do them? They are thinking long-term too. I doubt they are even selling a lot of their Bitcoin Cash.

Edit: Miners like Viabtc that mined Bitcoin Cash initially, lost significant money when it was new."
I think much of the profit comes per block discovery, so slower blocks means less income for miners. Waiting for 2016 blocks to pass at a rate of one block every few hours potentially could paralyse the network - the one caveat being a usable 0-conf.
It is based on research done on altcoin diff algo (cryptonote I believe).
"haha, -22 points. They didn't like hearing that!

edit: now -27"
">Say all of the sudden 50% of the miners disappear. Block times would double but so would your share of the block reward.

Not if the difficulty then drops by 80%. "
"> I don't even notice any variations in block times

What world do you live in?"
"> You really think a whole new diff algo doesn't need months of testing and optimizing?

Yes?

*Anything* would be better than EDA. Let's try:

Set the difficulty based on the average (mean) block time of the last 288 blocks (48 hours worth of blocks at a normal rate).

No more stupid EDA oscillations, going between 40 blocks per hour and 0.4 blocks per hour. Done, easy, sorted. Could implement this tomorrow and the network would be stable within a week."
Bitcoin Cash is about scaling. We canâ€™t have slow transactions, ever. Period.
"The long difficulty adjustment algorithm in Bitcoin is great for making sure that accidental minority forks die quickly and is a great protection mechanism for that.

It's not so great when a fork is deliberately aiming to take hash power.

It's not clear if protection from both these scenarios is possible."
"> I think the reason Satoshi picked that particular algorithm is precisely because any faster-reacting algorithm can be gamed.

The EDA was never part of the original algorithm and its the EDA that is currently being gamed.

Emergency Difficulty Adjustment
In fairness EDA worked exactly as advertised.

Since this sub believes miners control the protocol your reasoning will likely hit a cognitive dissonance barrier in their minds. 
That's the problem. My understanding is that its going to be deployed after the November 2X fork. I think that is too late. The oscillations in the current EDA seem to be getting bigger and bigger.
"The current EDA doesn't trigger often enough to keep the network at a (roughly) stable 10-min blocktime when hash rates fluctuate, though. Adding the ability for it to increase difficulty would be an improvement, but swings in difficulty would still exist, just less severe. I think just replacing it with an algorithm designed to produce a faster, more gradual increase/decrease gives better benefits for the long-term, especially since either would be a hard fork anyways.  


The SHA256 environment now includes quite a bit of miner competition between chains, and it may get worse with more forks. The chain that takes those hash rate swings in stride the most effectively will have the advantage due to a better user experience."
[deleted]
This would diminish trust in miners a fair bit - chasing short term profits rather than following a long term vision.
I just unload all the BCH, free from BTC anyway. Will probably buy it back if BCH drop below 100.00 or 50.00. Frankly, I don't believe BCH will die but rather will behave like BTC drop like rock then slowly rebounce that no one can stop after shaking out some of the big holders.
"So in your view it is overvalued for an indefinite amount of time?

Those bastards the miners... If only the market had a way to adjust the price of something to it's price... Oh wait.

Which price did dumb people bought btc for? We're they dumb two weeks ago too?"
[removed]
"The EDA-gaming is definitely causing some price effects. Personally I am buying the BCH dip. The EDA is speeding up block rewards, but that doesn't effect the total coin issuance. If the miners are dumping, then they're likely selling for below market value. All other signs in the BCH space are bullish.

Edit: FFS, look at these 2x fiascoes going on. BTC is in for a rough ride and I can only say this is also bullish for BCH and alts."
"To be fair, the EDA didn't need months of testing... It was obviously broken from the get go.

But lots of bozos downvoted me in this sub when I said the asymmetrical adjustment would lead to instability and exploitation. "
"The EDA is not designed to maximize miner profits, it is designed to prevent a situation where no blocks get mined and you can't complete transactions.

If BCH went back to the BTC difficulty adjustment algorithm, there might be weeks or even months of no blocks in certain circumstances."
well BTC diff algo is just as broken.
"Exactly. That's why the effort should be focused on migrating people from the legacy chain to Bitcoin Cash instead, i.e. ""there can be only one"".

Then the EDA problem will auto-solve itself."
I don't think anyone on the core side is particularly worried. Perhaps in the beginning but the btc difficulty has averaged itself out so it even kind of takes into account the hash rate temporarilt dropping now and then. I have a new appreciation for the momentum of Satoshis difficulty choice.
The alternative is tarnishing their reputation and destroying all support for big blocks or hard forks. Without any change, Bitcoin Cash cannot survive forever as a minority chain.
I know, what I mean is to see how easily a HF can be arranged with stakeholders.
"> this will create another coin as EDA

It will not create another valid coin.  Nobody wants hyperinflation Bitcoin Cash, nobody will accept these mined coins. no exchange will list them.  This is FUD."
"Amaury mentioned publishing the simulation results of the new algorithm. Does anyone know where they can be found?

*Edit: nvm, found it.*"
Has there ever been any issue with it?
This is probably much more complex than improving the difficulty algorithm.
I think it could be done. Bitcoin's difficult adjustment algorithm is fairly unsophisticated and could be countered with a more sophisticated algorithm and if some compromises were accepted (targeting a 10 minute block time at this stage was both unwise and unneeded).
Couldn't you just run it on a testnet, and feed various input simulations (like slow blocks, fast blocks, quick changes, etc)?
Unfortunately, at the halvening, the current EDA means there would not be more scarcity and a higher price.
It'd be too frequent. Variance would be an issue. 
">It's a gradual flippening. More hash rate arrives each time this happens. This is how Bitcoin Cash kills off the legacy coin.

Ahahahahahah. Oh, wait you're serious? Ahahahahahahahahahahah! "
Yeah the way up seems fine, it's the way down that's rediculous since the difficulty cuts by 80-90% too rapidly and then we get 20+blocks/hr
Deadalnix's proposal does this.
for political purpose.. people will prop up BCH1 because they want to divide BCH in 2 and it will be profitable anyways cuz all the noobs will not understand the EDA issue.
