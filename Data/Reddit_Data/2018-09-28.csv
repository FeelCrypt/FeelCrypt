Censored =/= heavily moderated. They're not the same thing. Which was kind of the main point in this conversation.
"Almost every user here was banned from r\bitcoin for discussing bitcoin, facts about bitcoin, the history of bitcoin, or the fact that the moderators there engage in censorship and not moderation.

*Moderation* would mean the mods uphold the rule, but instead we see thousands of examples of posts and comments remove when no rules were broken if they say something that goes against the newly designed btc coin (you know, the one with full blocks and many other things that were expressly said to not be wanted in bitcoin by Satoshi), and of coruse vice versa.

At best you're a total newb who has never done any research into the facts of this matter."
"> Good point though, thank you.

I replied this to you earlier."
"lol, no alt coins rule on the sidebar doesn't jive with the hundreds of threads on litecoin

I was banned almost 2 years ago for circumventing their automoderator filter by posting the phrase ""0p3n m0derator l0gs"". That is the definition of censorship.

At best you're a woefully ignorant latecomer."

"honestly it sounds like you just drank the koolaid and you've never bothered to look up the facts which prove beyond a doubt how wrong you are. Here is just one example of *censorship* in r\bitcoin that can be proven to be *not moderation* https://medium.com/@johnblocke/a-brief-and-incomplete-history-of-censorship-in-r-bitcoin-c85a290fe43

"
"> And then continued to argue semantics so I reiterated my actual point outside of your argument.

Why..?"

discussion of bitcoin is not allowed in r\bitcoin? Where have you been? https://medium.com/@johnblocke/a-brief-and-incomplete-history-of-censorship-in-r-bitcoin-c85a290fe43
