"Segwit as a core concept restructures transactions to move the ""what's happening?"" data and the ""who authorized that?"" data into two separate piles. That's it. That can be done by any client as part of how transactions they create are structured.

The benefits of having the clear delineation of ""here's where the actions stop and the verification begin"" mean the algorithm for figuring out transaction size can just count the two parts separately (which is the ""block weight"" concept that was added), and it introduced the possibility of a new type of node behavior that's not as light as a light client (it keeps all transactions, not just the ones related to it's addresses), but not as heavy as a full node (after checking the ""who authorized it?"" data to verify it's correct, it only writes the ""action"" data to its local hard drive, saving some space, trusting itself that it only writes valid data into it's own database), in addition to marking it very clear which transactions are distinct (have different ""actions""; which is the ""transaction malleability"" problem). That last one is the one that makes second-layer functionality like Lightning networks able to be done in an easy, trusted manner. So, Segwit itself has no additional fees included in it; it just provides additional hooks/features for other things to utilize it they want.

Since the Segwit-enabled chain now doesn't have ""block size"" but instead ""block weight"", I'd be interested to see if there were options to increase the block weight or the ratio weight different types of transactions get (prioritize old coins moving? Allow the block to be bigger if it's older could?), for a more nuanced capacity increase?";1;0;False;MidnightLightning;dpc7mrz;Bitcoin cash VS Bitcoin, a shockingly accurate representation;https://i.redd.it/pikogpl67rvz.png

"The transactions are essentially the same (other than the very small number that are segwit on BTC) so it's pretty much a wash.

There will be natural pushback on the block size as adoption continues and there will be greater incentives to generate layer-2 solutions (rather than trying to put the cart before the horse as is happening now). Solutions should happen naturally, not be forced or we end up with farces like Solyndra.

Pre-existing blockchain size *is* an issue, I agree and there are some things that could be done to help with that but it seems that anything that doesn't attempt to push things on to layer 2 (a solution which is currently non-existent) sees very little developer interest.";2;0;False;Richy_T;dpbnowp;Bitcoin cash VS Bitcoin, a shockingly accurate representation;https://i.redd.it/pikogpl67rvz.png

"I totally agree that this could be a very big problem. 

I'm just not sure upping the blocksize every time you hit the limit is the way to fix this problem. I hope upping the max blocksize doesn't mean even more spaced is used, because running a full node is already out of reach for normal people. 

Looking at the total block size:
[154.07 GB](https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin%20cash/)
[164.89 GB](https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/)

If you want maximum decentralization, just using more space doesn't seem the best bet. I can't find out if there is a size difference in average transaction size on BTC vs. BCH.

That's true, but you are doing the traditional banking system a big favor with that approach.  You use your credit card.  Then you pay some bitcoin transaction fees to send money to gdax.  Then you pay some exchange fees to convert it to dollars.  You send that money to your checking account and use that money to pay your credit card bill.

"Hi, I'd like a cup of coffee and I'd like to pay in bitcoin.

Have you set up your LN wallet and enabled us as a user in your contract?

Uh, no, I was just driving to work.

OK, go stand over there, make the network and when its set up, come back.

Can I just send the BTC you directly?

Sure.

"If you haven't watched this yet, give it a watch.  These are the devs discussing how it will work.

"Watch the video and listen to some of the designers explain it.  They admit that Bob (the hub guy) needs to be, as they say, ""Really rich.""

Lighting is fast.

You have to set these payments up in advance.

In most cases, you just buy a $20 gift card at the company and when it runs out, you buy another.  The WHOLE idea of a LN is that you can walk in to Joe's Cup oh Joe and buy a coffee in 2 mins.  If you have have to set the wallet and payment up in advance...?  then its actually SLOWER than a regular payment.

Listen to these guys, they're talking bout funds getting held hostage and all sorts of other issues.

Most people can barely use a wallet.  Now they have to set a lock date and have multi-sigs?

KISS 

This is not simple.

But segregation doesn't compact the block or make is smaller.  It does, in theory, enable nodes to discard signatures of older blocks, thus saving disk space, but AFAIK this isn't actually implemented.;1;0;False;roybadami;dpbfj8e;"Jiang Zhuoer, founder of the world's third-largest mining pool: ""To be honest, I do not care about bitcoin now, bitcoin cash is bitcoin.
