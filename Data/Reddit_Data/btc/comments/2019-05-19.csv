"I've followed the user /u/ant-n for some time on this sub and in the old rbitcoin. this guy might be wrong sometimes (because everyone is wrong sometimes) but liar i think not. 

So i went through your post history, and it was easy enough to find the commentary. others can decide for themselves what you are saying:

https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/bownte/bitcoin_cash_is_for_everyone/ens3sr9

But the thing is, anyone who continues to participate in rbitcoin instead of calling out the takeover is, quite simply, **complicit.**

There are innocent users in rbitcoin who legitimately have no idea how much they're being lied to. But you, you know better. You're complicit. Sorry to have to break it to you, but you sold out.

"There is a hardware store on the left, why would it need a bunch of telegraph cables like the ones that we can see leaving the pole to go into that building? Same question for the building across the street, around the middle of the picture; there are cables that seems to go directly to some windows of that building, that has to be telephone.

Also from the article you sent most photos showcase telephone poles. The one photo that shows telegraph wires is quite different and doesn't seems to be used as a distributor of cables on street level.";1;1;False;Tritonio;eo429c5;Blockchain?;bq3k41;https://i.redd.it/7v8dqcdqsyy21.jpg

"By the way, these are telephone cables, not power cables.

-core's solution to this is legislating that there cannot be more than 10,000 telephones, and refusing to adjust that number. If more people need to communciate, then the persons who have phones can take messages for all the other.

-cash's option is to let it grow as it needs to, while seeking out ways to make it work at greater scale. All options for making it grow are on the table. Including taking notes for people that don't have phones.";3;1;False;robbak;eo31jcu;Blockchain?;bq3k41;https://i.redd.it/7v8dqcdqsyy21.jpg

"1) Core is simply 1 implementation. What you refer to as ""core"" is actually just general consensus. You guys enacted an act that was outside of the status quo. You forked off. Core did nothing to stop you. Neither did the rest of Bitcoin.

2) Cash's option is unneccessary considering that the chain is largely disused. On average, Bitcoin's blocks are 30x larger than your blocks. So sure, you have made way for the chain to grow as large as it wants. But it seems that no one is using it.";2;2;False;junseth;eo36wnp;Blockchain?;bq3k41;https://i.redd.it/7v8dqcdqsyy21.jpg
