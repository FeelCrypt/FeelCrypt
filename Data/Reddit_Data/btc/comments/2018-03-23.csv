I spent that entire year doing research into whats-what, and can tell you for a fact that it *was* a discussion. It wasn't a lets-sit-together-and-talk-things-over, coordinated discussion, but definitely a discussion. Medium posts, twitter, Slack, Discord. Lots of posts on reddit to and fro, many heated debates in the comment sections of both /r/bitcoin and /r/btc, and other subs.

The discussion rapidly polarized, with neither side wanting to give way to the other, but there most definitely was a discussion, and even though the discussion was politicized, many good informative and more importantly *factual* posts were made.";1;0;False;SatoshisVisionTM;dw5ftg1;Crypto jocks vs. nerds?...

No, when you create a post you get to decide if comments are free, or if you'd like people to pay to write comments, like if you'd like people two leave their 'two cents'-- but most people set it as free anyway - it's up to you as the content poster to choose the prices. What this does is give a lot of flexibility depending on what content you want to post, like a file, or a youtube video, writing, photography, music, whatever... You can set everything as 0 zero and just earn when people tip or upvote, but maybe you want people to buy an extended/behind-the-scenes video. etc.

"Once any “decentralized” platform goes mainstream the switch gets flipped.

Unless a platform is developed and ran totally anonymously. Otherwise, the powers that be will not allow such thing as an uncontrollable decentralized free community is a threat to control.

We’re lucky to even have cryptocurrency, and you see it’s a constant battle just to hold on to what we have. Luckily bitcoin was developed and released anonymously. Now the only hope to “destroy” the protocol is to gain control from the inside...

Nevertheless, keep trying, don’t ever give up because then, the outcome is certain.
