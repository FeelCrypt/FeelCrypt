"Facilitating the sale to get illegal drug deals that kills people on a daily basis to enrich yourself is definitely morally wrong. 

There are definitely thousands of people who started using drugs because it was so easy to get from Silk Road and a number of them definitely died like it happens to many hard drug users, directly because of his website.

McDonalds and unhealthy food can kill people yet it would be tyrannical to pick and choose what people eat.  Yet you don't see the tyranny of stopping people from taking drugs.  Yes it may not be the healthiest activity but it also like drinking alcohol or smoking cigarettes it is within people's abilities to make bad decisions.  People die from alcohol, people die from cigarettes and people die from junk food yet they are all readily available.  Free will gives people the ability to choose their path and if that means getting things that may be harmful to themselves.  But the silk road took something that was dangerous and made it less dangerous by bringing back reliability and predictability to drug markets.  The drugs were tested and reviewed which pushed for no adulterations to the product.  People were able to know what they were getting and could dose accordingly.  Just how ending prohibition went away with the dangerous bathtub gins the silk road pushed out the more dangerous and unpredictable products.  This and the elimination of turf warfare within this marketplace meant that it could greatly reduce the street violence caused by the street based drug trade.  The Silk road was harm reduction taking something that is harmful and making less harmful and is a strategy for helping people in need.   I have no right to dictate what goes in your body and you the same for me.  If we can get at the point of trying to tyranically controlling people and start to treat addiction as a social - medical problem you can approach a way of solving the problems.  Governments can't stop markets they can only make them more violent, dangerous and underground.  Like it or not the Silk road was a step in that direction and a force for good.  ;1;0;False;redsteakraw;e9vjwrs;A Petition to free Silk Road operator Ross Ulbricht has reached 100k signatures;9x3qp7;https://71republic.com/2018/11/14/petition-free-ross-ulbricht-100k/
