"> You can't give one reason backed up by research why increasingly the blocksize isn't the most prudent straight forward way to upgrade Bitcoin instead of that convoluted mess of a layer 2 called LN.

Dude.  How can you not get this?  I've explained this so many times.  An increased blocksize doesn't increase scale.  It's a stupid, dumbed down way of expanding throughput.  It wastes resources and eventually centralizes the network.  If 1 billion people want to use bitcoin everyday, there is not a blocksize that would be sufficient.  There is no storage that would be sufficient.  There is no ISP that would be sufficient.  You have to think outside of blocksize *eventually*.

LN gives us the ability to scale without wasting all theses resources.  I don't care about storing a record of every coffee purchase happening in Japan every day for the rest of my life on my computer.  Unless you want Bitcoin to be a centralized datebase controlled by 4 major global entities, then we have to have a separate payment layer with settlement on the blockchain.  This still secures every single payment to the blockchain, but allows bitcoin to remain decentralized on nodes all over the world.

A separate payment level is obvious and inevitable.

This isn't an argument, also isn't what I'm saying. 3-5 developers do want it. So do the next 30-50, and a boatload of users after that. If you don't want to use it, you don't have to!

>So you're saying in a decentralized system that people should be forced to do something?

I'm saying sending transactions take up resources, and impose an externality on the system in the form of node resources, and very well distributed nodes are essential to the system (here''s where I'm guessing I lose you in agreement, but those are my views on what makes bitcoin valuable), and shouldn't be grossly underpriced to that burden they impose, hence tx fees.

"> Centralized control and forcing users to use Bitcoin in a specific way that 3-5 developers want is not the right path for Bitcoin. 

You're right that it's not an argument, it's an indisputable fact. If you disagree with that fact you don't belong in the Bitcoin space and you're basically a threat to Bitcoin and attacking it's fundamental values of decentralization.

I doubt 30-50 users genuinely wanted Segwit, that's the sad part - it was forced on an entire community, a silent majority, of tens of thousands. Propaganda, intense auto-block censorship, banning thousands of r/bitcoin users and other astroturfing tactics were used to get Segwit deployed. Without that censorship you would have seen the revolt against Segwit - not the ""large portion of the userbase"". And your bullshit astroturfing twitter NO2x campaign? Paid marketers. Blockstream has literally hired people to say bad stuff about anyone that stands in their way while pumping propaganda into their controlled r/bitcoin form. It's all BS and you know it.

That is not consensus my friend and it never will be. That is how core got Segwit deployed: by force. That breaks every idea that Bitcoin stands for and it makes them liars for on one hand insisting on consensus and disavowing non-consensus development while also pushing through such controversial code with not even 30% miner support. Arguing against that makes you a troll because you know it's true - and that's pathetic and sad. It's even shameful to support Core after the moves they've made.

Let's get down to the point though:

> I'm saying sending transactions take up resources, and impose an externality on the system in the form of node resources, and very well distributed nodes are essential to the system.

Do you actually know how much a full node that handles 8mb transactions per 10 minutes costs? Look into it, you'll be surprised at how stupidly cheap it is and almost any non-dial-up internet connection can handle it.

Secondly, mining decentralization is the only thing that matters. Nodes go on and off all of the time. Only mining nodes are real ""nodes"". Non-mining nodes can number the billions and it doesn't make the system any more decentralized because they are just relaying what miners have created and managing their own inputs and outputs. If you don't understand this then you aren't a programmer and have been misinformed by some other misinformed non-computer scientist.

Oh and the UTXO? It's stored in a local database and has been for years. It's not in memory. SSDs? Super fast now a days while getting larger and faster at an impressive rate. In a few years 1-5TB m.2 SSD drives will be in every laptop. Small form factor, huge capacity, super fast and cheap. 

This entire argument is based on your misunderstanding of computer science, how Bitcoin works and current/future hardware prices and accessibility. You have ZERO actual facts supporting any bullshit you've just said and I'm calling you out on it.";1;1;False;Annapurna317;doid23t;Just so you guys know: Ethereum just had another successful hardfork network upgrade.

">If there were actually mass agreement and confidence in the fork, everyone (like the miners currently signaling) would be snapping up cheap Segwit2x bitcoin futures.

Well we're not just talking about SegWit2x.   We're talking a diversion from Core.  A general movement.  And there is a lot of support.

Bitcoin Cash futures were getting snapped up like wildfire, and its been a few months, and it maintains a $300+ price, even after Xapo dumped millions (?) of coins.  

The diversion from Core may be splintered a bit, but all splinters should be focused on when evaluating whether or not there is any ""support"".

"> I think that you are wrong about this fact, as obviously there is all the noise we're seeing around the issue.

Circular logic.  There's no reason for the noise.  No justification for it.

> The fact that you can't even highlight the counterarguments (even if you don't agree with them or share the values that they are founded on) shows why.

What counterarguments?  2x is not a threat to the ecosystem. Bleeding users to altcoins is a threat to the ecosystem.  End of story.

> BTC has been a rocket, it spawning copycats and competing ideas for implementations of cryptocurrencies

Yes, and that's the problem.  Use your brain.  Why is it that Gold became a store of value?  Why not platinum?  Why not salt?  Why did bronze coins go out of style?  Why did people stop using obsidian as their currency?

The competing copycats aren't just competitors.  They're clones, but they evolve.  They improve.  It doesn't matter that 99.9% of them are complete shit.  What matters is the 0.1% that is functionally better than Bitcoin, that single competitor that can actually beat it and steal its network effects.

> Do you know what Microsoft's ""market share"" of the tech space did during the dot-com boom in the late 90's while MSFT quintupled in price? The same thing.

The reality is that a few CEOs made that agreement.  Without them, there's nothing.  The fact that an irrelevantly small subset of the community is being tricked into supporting it is inconsequential.  There will always be victims to attacks.

"username checks out

As I've already said, blockchains are consensus driven. Miners are free to do whatever they want with the blockchain that, at the end of the day, is just a bunch of files on their computer. If they want to chop the last 10 blocks off those files and run their miner with code that rejects a specific block hash (the ETH/ETC split), then they are completely free to do so.

With the ETH/ETC fork, no one person or group of people made the decision to do so. There was a large consensus between all users in the Ethereum ecosystem, and then the vast majority of miners agreed and ran the forked code.";2;1;False;flygoing;dogqwta;Just so you guys know: Ethereum just had another successful hardfork network upgrade.

One of my favorite usages are DEXs, decentralized exchanges. Basically it's a full crypto-currency exchange that is completely decentralized and everything is done on chain. All of the market/limit orders and matching are done in contract.

Once the scaling issues are solved - probably through sharding and/or plasma - we'll be able to do much more than mainly financial applications. Check out steem.io. It's a decentralized, completely on-chain, social platform that rewards its users for creating quality posts and curating others posts.
