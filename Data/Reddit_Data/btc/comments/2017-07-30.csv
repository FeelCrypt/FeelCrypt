"And Peter Rizun also said another point - which of course you are very artfully failing to mention here:

- Validationless mining with SegWit is _economically more incentivized_ than validationless mining without SegWit.

Why?

Because validationless mining _with_ SegWit lets you include _transactions_ in the block - and get the fees for that block.

But validationless mining _without_ SegWit does _not_ let you include transactions in the block - so you cannot get fees for that block.

This means the _economic incentives_ encouraging validationless mining _with_ SegWit are more powerful than _without_ SegWit.

He proves this - using simple and obvious highschool-level mathamatics - in his video, here:

https://youtu.be/hO176mdSTG0?t=687

Frankly, if you haven't yet published a frame-by-frame response, attempting to address every point raised by Peter Rizun in his devastating video exposing the lower security of SegWit, then you're a miserable failure who is not doing his job as CTO of Blockstream, and as one of the prime people guilty of pushing this abomination of SegWit onto the community.

There are a _lot_ of attacks described in that video _which are only possible with SegWit_.

And just because I haven't taken the time to quote and discuss every one of those attacks here on Reddit does _not_ mean that those attacks don't exist - and does _not_ mean that there aren't attackers out there who are ready and waiting to perform those attacks, once a significant amount of money is using SegWit.

So you are being grossly irresponsible here - and you're not even dealing with the major issues.

Some guy like me, who posts breathlessly on Reddit about attack vectors I heard about that exploit SegWit - _I_ am not the main vulnerability here.

The main risk is that _you_ - with your hubris and your pride, with your millions in fiat funding, with your censorship bubble that isolates you from real feedback - have carelessly allowed such deadly vulnerabilities to creep into your roadmap.

There are now hundreds if not thousands of people who now know about the vulnerabilities which SegWit will introduce into your ledger (but fortunately not into _our_ ledger - Bitcoin Cash - because _we_ are smart enough to _avoid SegWit like the plague that it is).

You're not going to fix any of that by engaging in a Reddit keyboard battle with me - since I'm just some guy that is doing my best to keep up on all these vulnerabilities as they get reported by devs who are in many cases much smarter (and much more psychologically ""balanced"") than you are.

You _think_ you fixed the ""SegWit validationless mining"" attack vector, by posting some irrelevant link, talking about some ""voluntary"" signaling mechanism which you yourself admitted ""MUST NOT be strongly relied upon"" - but [Peter Todd already pointed out (succintly) that your so-called solution is _not_ a solution](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6qdp90/peter_todd_warning_on_segwit_validationless/dkwvyim/), and I also pointed out (long-windedly) the same thing, [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6qdp90/peter_todd_warning_on_segwit_validationless/dkwwc2e/?context=1) and [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6qdp90/peter_todd_warning_on_segwit_validationless/dkwt5yl/?context=1).

So you need to step up your game. The dynamic is different now.

- Before, there was only one Bitcoin chain - the one you lorded over, forcing everyone into believing that your dead-end roadmap was inevitable, and your buggy SegWit was inevitable.

- Those days are about to end as of August 1 - when we will finally have two Bitcoin blockchains: 

   - Bitcoin Cash, which _preserves_ Satoshi's original definition of Bitcoin (""a chain of digital signatures""

   - Bitcoin SegWit, which _destroys_ Satoshi's original definition of Bitcoin - replacing it with Core's dangerously bastardized definition (""Segregating the signature data allows nodes to avoid downloading it in the first place, saving resources."")

From that point on, it's no longer going to be enough for you to write a few hand-waving comments on Reddit, bullshitting naive people into thinking you have any fucking clue what you're talking about.

From that point on, people are going to be able to attack your crippled (1 meg) buggy (SegWit) shit-chain.

And investors who foolishly trusted your handwaving will finally discover just what kind of dev (and person) you really are - when tens of billions of dollars evaporates on the Bitcoin SegWit ledger due to your incompetence and corruption.

At that point in time, the new slogan is going to be:

**Bitcoin SegWit investors jumping out of windows - Bitcoin Cash investors unaffected**

"> if you read the OP carefully you will see segregating the data has other consequences that change the Nash Equilibrium. 

I read it, I even started working on the game theory payoff table as I was initially convinced.

Until 51% turn off validation, the attacker must increase his own orphaning rates to try to coerce validating miners to turn off validation.  After that moment the Nash Equilibrium is completely ruined the first time a counter-attacker punishes the miners who are skipping validation.

> It has to do with the latency of the segregated data and how it permeates though the network.

That doesn't matter when most nodes, particularly merchants and exchanges, will not treat a segwit block as valid without valid witness data.  If an attacker and 51+% of non-validating miners attempted to do this they'd be forking off to form a theft-coin fork which would then have to compete in the marketplace against Bitcoin.  Exchanges would not follow it, and it would have no price.  Since a miner turning off validation is not even comparable to a miner deciding they are going to support a risky theft-coin fork, the non-validating miners would defect almost immediately and turn validation back on.

The attack COULD cause re-orgs on the main chain but only up until a counter-attacker forks all of the non-validating miners off to punish them for skipping validation.

oh no!

There is no way to verify that the data in that header is correct (e.g. the prevhash value), and in fact slush apparently used this to cause f2pool to mine some invalid blocks a while back causing them to stop spymining off them.

> I think you're confusing the fact that the witness data is moved to a different part of the block with it being moved out of the block.

Lol, I never rely on news articles as being a solid source for extremely technical distinctions like this one.

The original block structure doesn't have any places for witness data to be moved to.  What it does have is a place for the merkle root hash of the witness data to be required(coinbase string), which is probably what that article was referencing.  Non-upgraded nodes don't have the ability to receive and discard the witness data, instead they are only sent legacy transactions that function as 100% compatible so long as 51% of miners are applying the new meaning of ""anyone-can-spend"" rather than the old meaning.

Segwit compatibility is negotiated with service bits by peers, and then witness data is sent in a different set of messages.  See here:

"> You seem to say there is no problem because there is currently no efficient P2P message which excludes the witnesses? That is a very strange and risky assumption. Nobody controls the protocol so we can only assume

Quoting from the message you replied to,

**You have completely ignored my point about miners communicating a few thousand byte output bloom filter. Why have you ignored this point? As it shows, signature data has never been necessary to ""claim fees"", directly refuting your conclusion.**

Your ignoring of it is pretty conspicuous now. 

And you're also misunderstanding my point: It's not that compact blocks ""includes"" the witness data, its that it it efficiently transmits blocks without transmitting signature data or witness data at all-- the transactions are transmitted with 6 byte short IDs.  Switching to something else that somehow excluded witness data wouldn't be an advantage, it would be significantly less efficient to send non-witness data instead of short IDs (as I mentioned, about 750KB compared to 30KB).   Communicating a spent output filter would be more efficient, but that applies universally, segwit or not.

"> Except it can't. Validationless mining is an risk for lite clients created by the day one design of Bitcoin, but it isn't changed by segwit (at least not anymore).

Except it _can_. 

As you yourself just went on to admit.

In the very same paragraph.

Where you said:

> Validationless mining ... **isn't changed by segwit**

See what you did there? You just admitted - again - that validationless mining _can_ be exploited by SegWit. (You also tried to ""deflect"" - by saying that there are _other_ ways of doing validationless mining - **but you did not at any point, here or elsewhere, ever _deny_ that SegWit can be exploited to do validationless mining**).

Second of all: Peter Rizun showed in his talk that the ""validationless mining"" which can be done by exploiting SegWit is very _different_ (ie worse) than the kind of validationless mining that can be done by other methods, before SegWit.

Namely, validationless mining previously _could not earn fees_.

But with SegWit, now validationless mining _could_ earn fees.

Maybe you think people were too stupid to notice that ""little detail"" (which, as Peter Rizun also pointed out, will end up having _massive_ economic consequences - just skip forward to his slide with the formulas involving P for probability and Fees - the math is very easy, any high-school student could understand it) - but, don't try to pull a fast one on us like this: We _are_ paying attention, and we _did_ notice that **SegWit validationless mining is more economically incentivized than previous types of validationless mining.**

And finally, there is another level to all this - the level where we do _not_ assume all miners are non-malicious. We need to consider the case of _malicious_ miners as well. In this case, ""Segwit validationless mining"" is actually an attack vector - which could be exploited to corrupt the SegWit Bitcoin ledger.

So far, you have very studiously avoided talking about ""Segwit validationless mining"" in the setting of malicious miners - you have only talked about it in the setting of non-malicious miners. You do not have the right to make this assumption.

And your link, where you say that the problem has been ""solved"" - it's obvious to anyone that the ideas at that link _only apply to the case of non-malicious miners_.

So - once again - you're glossing over an entire chunk of the problem space.

And by now, we've seen you do this time and time again.

The point is: you're toxic. You have some kind of ego problem where you just want to be right all the time - even if it means destroying half of Bitcoin's market cap with your fatally flawed ""roadmap"" - and now even if it means destroying Bitcoin's security model with your fatally flawed SegWit.

I know it can be delicate veering off into these more ""psychological"" areas, but you're a special case - a toxic dev with an immense amount of sway over less-informed members of the Bitcoin community - and you've been abusing their trust in you as a way for your to satisfy these psychological ""issues"" you have - where you have this absolute mania to impress people and maintain this image that you're always ""right"" - when the reality is that you have been _wrong_ about a lot of things (wrong about mathematically proving that Bitcoin would never work, wrong about blocksize, wrong about your roadmap which destroyed half of Bitcoin's share of cryptocurrency market cap - and now wrong about how the ""Segwit validationless mining"" attack vector could destroy Bitcoin's security model).

This is why it's important for people to call you out. You're influential - but you're wrong - about some of the most important issues in Bitcoin: its viability, its blocksize, its scaling roadmap, and now its security model - which no less than three respected devs have conclusively demonstrated would be significantly damaged by your precious, poorly programmed SegWit.

Any self-respecting human being would have bowed out long ago after being exposed as so utterly incompetent and corrupt as you are.

But we know that you are immune to concepts such as decency or a sense of shame.

You only to to be ""right"". Even when you're dead-wrong - to the tune of tens of billions of dollars.

Due to this serious psychological problem that you have - where you literally do not give a fuck if you destroy tens of billions of dollars in investor wealth - you will have a very special place in history.

"BIP144 adds new messages types, but those aren't separate, they're the replacements.  This is how it's backward compatible, so the witness information *that's in the block* is not delivered to peers that would not be able to parse it, instead they will receive a block with random-seeming scriptPubKeys (witness commitments) and no witness data.  But a segwit-understanding client will receive the entire block, which is made up of transactions and witness data.

See [BIP141](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0141.mediawiki):

> Transmission of signature data becomes optional. It is needed only if a peer is trying to validate a transaction instead of just checking its existence. 

There is no ""other block.""  All the witness data is in the block and included in the block header hash so that it cannot be modified without making the block invalid.  It simply doesn't need to be sent to everyone all the time.

> so long as 51% of miners are applying the new meaning of ""anyone-can-spend"" rather than the old meaning.

There is no change in the meaning of anyone-can-spend transactions, it's simply that if you were to construct a transaction using that as an input it would be rejected by the network.

After studying it for a while, I believe the correct description of the problem is this: the witness data moves ""down"" / later in the block, so that miners must download more data before validating and beginning to mine the next block on that one.  Extra every millisecond it takes to download and verify the signatures is another billion (or whatever) hashes in which they might find a valid block.  So they're incentivised to mine on un-validated block headers... for the tiny amount of time it takes to receive and validate the part of the block after the ~~header~~ edit: transactions.

Basically miners can be incentivized to mine without validating all of the data.  Currently it happens without segwit, but there exists a Nash Equilibrium (in game theory), where the incentives make it so it does not get out of hand.  If the % of validationless miners gets too high as it is now, it becomes unprofitable, and easy to attack.  But under a segwit protocol, this greatly changes things.  The incentives are changed, the segwit data being separated from the blockchain enlarges the problem, resulting in a change to the Nash Equilibrium and an unstable and less secure system where miners are encouraged to do validationless mining at higher rates.  Also segregating data from the blockchain compounds and enlarges the consequences of validationless mining making it much more dangerous.;27;6;False;cryptorebel;dkx3hne;"Holy shit!

"And... has the fix been implemented?

Not according to Peter Todd, and Peter Rizun, and Bitcrust dev Tomas van der Wansem.

Not even according to Gregory Maxwell.

Go read the quotes. (I've quoted them enough times, not going to quote them again here.)

There ""is"" a fix in the sense that there is a concept, an understanding, an idea of how a fix _could_ be implemented.

But it has not been implemented yet.

So there _is_ a solution which _could_ solve the ""SegWit validationless mining"" attack vector.

Greg Maxwell implemented something which he says would _disincentivize_ it. He says that a (non-malicious) miner would be incentivized to prefer to use Compact Blocks (which only take up 30kb), rather than SegWit blocks (which take up 750kb).

But what about a _malicious_ miner? That would require a solution which not only disincentives exploiting the ""SegWit validationless mining"" - it would require solution which actually _prevents_ it.

And Greg Maxwell admits that no such solution has been implemented.

---

Of course, there _is_ a simple solution staring everyone in the face.

**Just don't use fucking SegWit at all - because it is shit code which was improperly designed from the beginning.**

Previously, we had to beg and plead with guys like Greg to not destroy our Bitcoin ledger like this.

Now it doesn't matter so much any more. Because there are going to be two separate, forked Bitcoin ledgers now - one using SegWit, and the other not (Bitcoin Cash).

So let Greg continue to fuck up his fork of the Bitcoin ledger - the SegWit fork.

The Bitcoin Cash fork will continue as the one which we _will not_ let Greg fuck up - because Bitcoin Cash will _not_ add SegWit.

"> I agree this is a problem with SeqWit. The question I have, is there a remedy to this problem? Can something be added to SW, or removed, that will avoid this problem?

This is not really a problem with segwit.  If the attacker games this correctly, suffering higher orphan rates himself for doing so and potentially lowering the price of Bitcoin he depends on, he might get 51% of miners skipping validation of witness data.

At that point, if a counter-attacker(trying to reduce his orphan rates/deal with re-org problems) simply releases an actual invalid block instead of turning off his validation, all of the non-validating miners will be forked off and begin bleeding money.

The success of the attack depends on the attacker building up an overwhelming majority of non-validating miners.  Even then segwit coins could only be stolen if the non-validating miners were actually willing to fork off permanently, and if they were willing to do that then we suddenly have theft-coin fork that is competing with bitcoin's chain.  Miners who never wanted to attempt such a risky and potentially disastrous fork would defect back to the main chain (re-enable validation) almost immediately and the fork would be dead.

At most miners could accomplish one re-org and cause SPV wallets to accept invalid transactions, but they'd probably end up losing hundreds of thousands of dollars when they get forked off, along with every other non-validating miner.

That's precisely the possibility that worries me the most.

In fact, Peter Todd also said basically the exact same thing, when he first warned about this vulnerability:

"I think the answer to this is that miners *can* do the same thing today, but that segwit gives them an extra incentive to do it, and potentially gives them a chance to get away with it.

That second half is controversial, though. The economic majority clearly wouldn't let miners hard fork and take *everyone's* coins. I don't think the economic majority would let miners hard fork and take all segwit coins either, but there is at least an argument that people using segwit are knowingly taking this risk so it's somehow less of an unacceptable thing for miners to do. (I hope the economic majority wouldn't buy into this argument, but I can't completely rule it out.)

Also, you have to remember that not *all* wallets know about segwit.

Meanwhile, u/nullc seems to be afraid to attempt to actually respond to the points raised by Peter Rizun in his presentation:

1. SegWit coins have a different definition than bitcoins, which gives them different properties.

2. Unlike with bitcoins, [with SegWit coins] miners can update their UTXO sets _without_ witnessing the previous owners' digital signatures.

3. The previous owners' digital signatures have significantly less value to a miner for SegWit coins than for bitcoins - because miners do no require them [the digital signatures] in order to claim fees [when mining SegWit bitcoins].

4. Although a stable Nash equilibrium exists where all miners witness the previous owners  for bitcoins, one [such a Nash equilibrium] does _not_ exist for SegWit coins.

5. SegWit coins have a weaker security model than bitcoins.

---

In fact, u/nullc (inadvertently?) _confirmed_ everything Peter Rizun said, when he admitted (as quoted above in the OP) that no solution for this has been implemented yet.

So... Greg has admitted that he's been trying - for 18 months! - to deploy SegWit, knowing this whole time that it enables the ""SegWit validationless mining"" attack vector discovered by Peter Todd - **and yet Greg did nothing to attempt to prevent this attack vector** - basically saying that he have a solution in your head, but he can't be bothered to implement it until _after_ disaster strikes.

So... what's Greg's strategy been here this whole time? ""Security through obscurity"" - hoping people wouldn't discover this attack vector?

It's just so sad that Greg has been prepared to jeopardize a ledger holding tens of billions of dollars in investors' coins - apparently because he's such a sleazebag that he'd rather shit-post weasel-words in defense of his corruption and incompetence, rather than openly discussing _and fixing_ the problems which several devs (not only Peter Rizun - but also Peter Todd, and Tomas van der Wamsen of Bitcrust) have exposed in SegWit.

If u/nullc had a shred of honesty and decency, he wouldn't be talking about Peter Rizun's job title or business partners here - which are entirely irrelevant to this SegWit attack vector.

Notice how u/nullc carefully avoids actually talking about _fixing the goddamn attack vector which Peter Todd and Peter Rizun and Tomas van der Wamsen have all confirmed_. Instead, like a typical toxic bully, he tries to deflect - talking about irrelevancies like Peter Rizun's job title and business partners. And then he has the nerve to call _other_ people unprofessional? 

Remember, u/nullc - the CTO of Blockstream - is desperately trying to deflect attention away from a deadly attack vector caused by the crappy code which _he_ has been trying to force on everyone for years now - and he has the _nerve_ to call someone ""unprofessional"" for merely exposing this deadly attack vector in his code. Really?!?

Let's try to stay on-topic here - and try to be ""professional"".

Three major devs have exposed a deadly attack vector which would be enabled by SegWit - enabling miners to add invalid transactions to the chain, without being noticed. 

Are you going to _address the fucking problem u/nullc_ - or are you going to try to deflect and blather this irrelevant nonsense questioning Peter Rizun's job title and business associates.

"Bitcoin is built around the idea that the hash _is_ the id - so the right way to handle multisig transactions which are awaiting approval sigs, would be to label them as ""pre-transactions"", and send them around as a message that is listened to by other signees wallets .. then when approved, that becomes a real, valid, signed transaction with a totally un-malleable hashid.  No crazy workarounds, no breaking the fundamental assumptions of the whole system.  Just admit a partially signed transaction, is _not_ a transaction.

A side issue is the protocol should be flexible enough to handle propagating data of various kinds, not only blocks or transactions. This allows for smoother upgrades, as the protocol is future-flexible [ wont need as many hard-forks to upgrade ] 

There are a vast number of engineering and performance improvements to be built around the essential blockchain ideas .. particularly better data management, so less bandwidth, storage and ram is wasted - and this can be done in a way that doesn't break the fundamental assumptions of the whole system.

"> it absolutely does mean that the security model for segwit coins is strictly weaker than for bitcoins

I liked your at TFOB, but I don't think it showed this. What you showed was that Segwit gives miners an incentive to mine without validating the signatures of segwit transactions (probably more accurately, it lowers the disincentive to not validating those signatures). This is bad because it could cause orphans if a minority of miners are doing it and an invalid block is produced, or could cause a long-term chain split if a majority of miners are doing it and an invalid block is produced.

But that harms all of Bitcoin. It only changes the security model for segwit coins if your wallet isn't validating the blockchain (e.g. SPV wallets).";9;1;False;anthonyjdpa;dkx86ne;"Holy shit!

"> Currently it happens without segwit, but there exists a Nash Equilibrium (in game theory), where the incentives make it so it does not get out of hand. If the % of validationless miners gets too high as it is now, it becomes unprofitable, and easy to attack. But under a segwit protocol, this greatly changes things. The incentives are changed, the segwit data being separated from the blockchain enlarges the problem, resulting in a change to the Nash Equilibrium and an unstable and less secure system where miners are encouraged to do validationless mining at higher rates

This game theory is completely ruined if there is a single counter-attacker who will actively attempt to exploit the validationless miners' own vulnerability.  Doing so will being the counter-attacker's orphan rates back under control instantly and cause the validation-skipping miners to bleed money until they turn validation back on to get back on the main chain.

"> the segwit data being separated from the blockchain enlarges the problem

Tell me what I'm missing here...

Under SegWit, the witness data is moved to the end of the transaction, and it's no longer part of data used to compute the transaction hash, as seen in the diagrams [here](http://learnmeabitcoin.com/faq/segregated-witness) or [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzBAG2Jp4bg#t=1m30s).  But it's still part of the transaction, and still hashed into the Merkle chain.

For a concrete example, you can easily find the witness data 3044..cc01 and 2103..acac in the transaction hex dump in this segnet tx:

[https://blockchainprogramming.azurewebsites.net/checktx](https://blockchainprogramming.azurewebsites.net/checktx)

So when you say ""separated from the blockchain,"" are you talking about when the transactions are delivered from a SegWit-supporting client to a client that doesn't know about SegWit and couldn't understand that information?

"> If someone/anyone submits invalid segwit transactions to validationless miners, and the miners that are validating throw away the resulting invalid blocks, then validationless miners get more orphans. That sets up an incentive to do the validation to avoid one's blocks being orphaned.

This scenario can be avoided by making sure the attacker is always creating valid blocks, but delaying the witness data for increasing periods of time.  Then the attacker's blocks are valid and it is the validating miners who suffer a higher orphan rate.

But even that attack scenario has a simple fix, similar to what you are saying.  All it would take is for a counter-attacker to periodically release a block that looks like the attacker's blocks, but never release its witness data.
