"I don't even see the necessity in responding to the first two points since we'll just have to disagree on a fundamental level rather than going back and forth for eternity with the same arguments.

>The claim has nothing to do with your personal viewership or subscription to either sub. The claim charges a systemic bias towards members of these communities by allowing them to flout rules on vote brigading, posting FUD and spam, etc. Anyone who's read r/cc for the last year and a half at least, or just search 'monero', will see the copious amounts of spammy monero posts. There were even threads a year ago that called out how many monero posts were on the front page.
>That has nothing to do with whether or not you 'visit r/ltc'. You know this, the fact that you seek to hide it means you have a nefarious agenda in your replies. You are subtly responding to strawmen in order to mislead.

If you have a problem with those subs, that has nothing to do with us. It's starting to seem like, to you - every other sub has problems but yours.

I don't ever recall hearing allegations like that nor do I see any proof to substantiate those claims.

>Again, Search for 'Dash' in r/cc. Every Dash post that is postive, good news gets nearly 0 views, almost always 0 comments, and almost always 0 upvotes. Now things seem to be changing a bit, but anyone who has visited the sub over at least the last year and a half will agree that Dash FUD was allowed and actively encouraged.

How is it our fault if a project doesn't get enough upvotes? And as I've said before, we don't allow FUD and we remove it when we see it.

>And the fact that you have as a moderator one of the more prominent members of the xmr community, to whom one of your mods referred as a 'xmr fanboi', is massive red flag and shows strong conflict of interest. Normally, it would be rather strange, but not necessarily untoward for a prominent member of a community to become a moderator of a GENERAL body of such communities. For example, it would be weird for the King of England to be also the King of France, Germany, Spain, Portugal, and the Netherlands at the same time (real life historical examples notwithstanding; those of which, anyway, stand out because of their strangeness).

So we have one mod who was active in the Monero community? So what? We have mods that come from a diverse group of communities.

>However, the xmr community is widely known to be very 'aggressive' with their bias, with their 'marketing' ('SHUM teehee', 'fluffy says, 'don't buy monero'', 'Monero is the only truly private coin', 'monero is the only truly fungible coin', etc.), it is a massive conflict of interest for one of the more prominent members of the xmr community to be a mod there, and to have been there for so long. This is a MASSIVE red flag that indicates that the same force that was able to buy up r/bitcoin, censor it and take it over is the same force that bought of r/cryptocurrency, and the xmr community is aligned with that force by the employment of a prominent member of their community in a position of power where they can influence competing communities through censorship. That's why he felt comfortable threatening to BAN ME for posting the wired article about monero's privacy being broken. 

We hear a variation of this all the time from a few people who try to stir up drama - and they are not true. I've heard people saying we're ""bought off"" by Bitcoin or Walton or Monero or Nano or Req or whatever. All these accusations are baseless, unsubstantiated and completely untrue. It's like me saying r/btc is bought off by Roger Ver.

>I posted a thread here about it.

Can you link the thread? Because I am curious what happened since I've never seen a shadowban config since I've started moderating.

Regardless of your views, I can confirm without a doubt I am not paid for this position nor am I aligned with [insert coin]'s interests. I follow the rules, apply them as fairly and consistently as possible and have no intention to ever break that oath.
