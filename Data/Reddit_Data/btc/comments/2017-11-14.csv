"I believe cryptos are the future and are a totally new paradigm of currency, similar to the switch from a barter system to a money system. But I don't think it will bring as many negatives as you think. 

>total break down of all the supply chains

Which supply chains? Financial ones? Of course, but people will still make things. The greater economy as a whole will continue on. Goods will be produced and transactions will be made, on whatever medium is most convenient. Wall street may go down, but new systems of capital investment, like ICOs, will take its place. And it won't happen simultaneously or instaneously. It will be fast, for sure, but relatively tractable.

>End of total taxation

Cash, as it is, is anonymous and untraceable, that doesn't stop governments from being able to tax people. Sure, there is a black market, but the majority of people still pay taxes. 

I do agree that it is all very scary. I can't be certain of what is going to happen, but I'm not so pessimistic about it. I think it can be the start of a lot of very good things as well. The one thing that scares me the most is the idea of autonomous systems taking control of the economy in even small but appreciable ways, and runaway algorithms leading to unpredictable crises. We like to think that the decentralization of finances because of cryptos can prevent this but I actually think, in some ways, it may make it more susceptible.

"Monero's claim to fame is privacy.  Unlike most blockchains (Ethereum, Litecoin, Bitcoin, etc), the sender address, receiver address, and amount are not visible to the network.  This makes Monero fungible, where any one unit is indistinguishable from any other, like cash.

Main pros:

- Grass-roots open source project just like Bitcoin
- Mandatory privacy enforces strict fungibility across the entire network
- Limited supply of 18.4 million units mined until 2022 when it becomes 0.6 XMR mined per 2-minute block forever.  See [supply emission curve](https://imgur.com/a/De0G2).
- Dynamic block size supports future growth so it should not run into the scaling debate that Bitcoin had
- Strong development team, one of the most active in the cryptocurrency space
- Seeing dark net market adoption; likely a good speculative vehicle
- Features coming soon^tm: more mobile wallets, multisig, kovri to hide your ip, sub-addresses, payment processors
- Community has a weekly [""Skepticism Sunday""](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/76iczg/skepticism_sunday_what_concerns_you_about_monero/?st=j9zoyd6r&sh=0cd09bf1) to address its biggest weaknesses.
- Auditable supply
- No founder's fee
- No trusted setup

This is unlike Zcash, its largest competitor:

- Centralized development under one company
- Founder's fee of 20%
- Trusted setup; we trust the Zcash developers to have destroyed 'toxic waste' at creation else they can create infinite Zcash
- Supply is not auditable, so if anyone creates more Zcash, it will not be known
- Optional privacy; very few transactions are shielded in practice which compromises all fungibility
- Shielded transactions require intense computing power which take minutes to make on modern, non-mobile hardware";2;1;False;loveforyouandme;dpsyvan;Bought my first bitcoin for $6 in 2011.

"He claims he paid it to some company called Slickage Studios run by a couple of college students at the University of Honolulu and that it is all spent now.  If you look into the owner of Slickage Studios he bought an $800,000 luxury condo in 2015.  Just a couple years prior the guy was living in a really dumpy apartment and was a student. The Slickage Studios address has now been changed to the law offices of some real estate attorney and there is no sign that they are ever going to make any attempt to improve the BitcoinTalk forum software.

All this is verifiable if you go look at the Hawaii State Business records database and property sales records on Zillow.

And when you've read that bashing the first thing you want to read is the relevant small blocker defending their side.

I watched the whole thing play out in real time and it's still kind of surreal for me every time I see one of these old posts. Because it's easy to forget the history and start to imagine that r/bitcoin has always been a huge pro-Core circle jerk. But that's not the case at all. In fact, there was a time when it was overwhelmingly supportive of on-chain scaling.  The systematic and *relentless* censorship and debate manipulation were shockingly and disturbingly effective at completely transforming the sub. ;14;1;False;Capt_Roger_Murdock;dptloo5;Saw a post asking Theymos where the donated 6900 BTC is disappear before my very eyes.

"Just a quick word of caution: reading that post now, out of the context of the time, makes it sound more extreme than you might think was necessary. People were calling for everyone to immediately ""upgrade"" to XT without understanding the implications. There was literally a post where someone was asking for technical help on how to get their Bitcoin node to sync faster and someone responded that their node was ""out of date"" and to download Bitcoin XT, even though that obviously wouldn't resolve the problem.

You also couldn't even question the technical details of XT without getting heavily downvoted because you appeared to be getting in the way of ""progress"". People who were being upvoted in support of XT were also generally not adding anything new to the discussion. It was an extremely one-sided environment where good points from the opposition were being drowned out and ignored, and debunked claims from supporters kept being mindlessly repeated.

This post is a good toned down example of that. People keep posting it every few weeks and people who have more insight into the claim get tired of refuting it. Count up real quick how many opposing voices you see in this thread, then count up the number of posts that call for pitchforks without providing any extra details about why pitchforks are needed. Compare that to the number of useful anti-theymos posts like /u/jessquit's below. Once you do that, you should have a slightly better understanding of the context. Just remember, it was that x10.

"I believe you are wrong however I'm not a lawyer (and I assume you aren't either, right?). But theymos did make a promise for something in return for contributions made to the forum. Whether or not that was in the form of a donation or not to me doesn't make much difference. There was clear wording from theymos that if you donated funds in return he would provide a new custom built forum. There was a very specific cause for the funds to be used for which he has to this day failed to do.

**A scam is a scam is a scam**. Whether or not the funds were charitable in nature or more malicious which may be in this case, where it's actually not a donation but the people were scammed out of their money under the guise of ""donations."" If theymos actually had a 501c3 nonprofit maybe he could say it was donations. However, to make matters worse for him, he does not have a charitable tax status so technically no funds were ""donated"" in the eyes of the IRS. Theymos does live in the United States I remind you.

This only matters if it was spent immediately or purposely held for their own gain. It all must be used since that bitcoin was meant to aid the project. Honestly if the donators don't care how they used it then there's no problem here other than him getting blocked for asking a very valid question.

"A lot of people felt like it was, but no one has come up with a smoking gun.  The issue is there was basically zero accountability.  Everyone just had to take Theymos' word for it that he was doing what he said.  Even if you take him at his word that he was paying 100k a month to have forum software developed it seemed fishy because that is a huge amount of money to be paying to a company that is little more than a couple of college students.  They did eventually post some opensource code on Github but it was never used to upgrade bitcointalk.  

So you have this situation where everyone has plausible deniability and all the victims were only defrauded of a smallish amount of money so it isn't worth anyone's time to put a lot of effort into taking these guys down.  But the owner of slickage almost certainly made out on the deal who knows what was in it for Theymos maybe he really was dumb enough to pay that much money and get almost literally nothing in return.

EDIT: Thanks everyone who corrected me on the meaning of censorship. r/btc is not censoring. However, I do maintain that it is impossible to have the opposing view than that of the sub on BTC vs BCH and not get downvotes to oblivion. I also maintain that the war mongering mentality of people here is as bad as the one from people on the other sub.

"Oh okay, I get it then. So this is just another case of people honestly thinking that BTC or BCH can be as common as a VISA payment within just a couple years from now. 

It's crazy how many people are so caught up in which coin is better because it will be better for spending, but in reality, that's really far off and in the moment it's 100% about each coin as a store of value and what would gain people the most fiat $ in the short term if they completed liquidated their position.

People want to say, I have 5BCH, I used $1000 to get that but I basically made $6000 (or whatever - depending on current price) if I sold it all right now. 

people really need to wake up and understand that no one is planning on making this their day-to-day payment system for a long while. Yes, the devs and other people supporting the coin have to tout what's good about their coin as far as future value, but in this very moment, it's all about each coin as a store of value. How are people not getting that? You think someone who can make $50k by moving their position from BTC to BCH this very week (or even vice-versa) really gives a fuck that BCH is the apparent better coin for the future. No, they wanted the $50k dude, the fact that they moved to the ""right"" chain is not of any fucking concern to them. If they cared about the right chain for what coin is going to be the future of payments, then people are saying they would literally sell off BTC even if it was more valuable in the moment, just to be on the right coin - even if it isn't currently worth more to them in financial terms.

What I mean is, you really think someone who say is assumiing BCH will tank to..lets say $500, is going to sell everything they have in BTC and say that would net them a $20,000 loss, just to get BCH just because in many years BCH should be worth way more?

Fuck no dude. They will hold onto or buy more of whatever is making them worth more NOW. They can worry later about what coin is better for payments, and at that time, that coin would be the hot coin, so they would switch anyway. You go where the money is hot, not where the fucking tech is going to be the best for the plan 20 years down the road, jesus christ. Use your heads people. It's about the fucking MONEY.

"You certainly seem to know what you're talking about and I respect your provision of actual examples. I think our difference of opinion is a difference of terminology. That is, there's a difference between algorithmic trading, such as carried out by many hedge funds - like Rennaissance and, as you say Numerai etc, and High Frequency Trading (HFT) that we are talking about here. 

Actual HFT does not incorporate TA because it is about responding incredibly fast to simple market moving information (preferably actual trades placed at other exchanges) and typically does (can not) incorporate any type of complex analysis of that information into the algorithm. Complex algorithms such as Neural Networks or TA simply cannot be made to run within the ~microsecond response time that characterizes HFT. HFT latency can be in the ball park of a microsecond [source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17256040/how-fast-is-state-of-the-art-hft-trading-systems-today) whereas neural networks take in the ballpark of a few milliseconds to run [source](https://github.com/jcjohnson/cnn-benchmarks) - even in feedfowward, non training mode, never mind actual online training - which is to say ANNs are thousands of times slower than HFT latencies require. 

More to the point, in practice, while yes HFT are, a sub class of algorithmic trading, the vast majority of actual HFT applications utilize only very simple algorithms that can be run in thousandths of a millisecond ballpark range, meaning they are about getting data where it needs to be as fast as possible and utilizing very simple trading strategies on that data within a very short time period.";1;0;False;utunga;dpsn39i;Mempool breaks resistance trend, strong support at ~87500.

That's the whole point behind having a block size limit. You can't have someone go off and decide if a tx is spam or not as then like you said censorship becomes an issue. So what is needed is to limit transaction capacity to make it cost prohibitive to spam. This way as a user I must make a decision on my own terms if the tx is worth it for me to pay for or not. This way it addresses the issue of spam while being censorship resistant.

"It's not about increasing speed it's about decreasing back log. Small blocks or big blocks if confirmation times are 10 minutes the speed is just the same, the difference is capacity. If you don't bid your way to the front of the line you are stuck waiting in line so you have to wait a long time to get a confirmation. Well with BTC it costs you $20 to get to the front of the line, with BCH it costs you $0.30. With BTC if you don't pay a premium price you're waiting several hours, with BCH if you don't you might get unlikely and need to wait an extra 10 minutes.

"> Consider the fact that we are fast approaching the 21 million limit. When that happens, miners are going to mine for the free.

The issuance halves every 4 years. It will be about 15 years until the block reward drops below 1 coin (from 1.5625 to 0.78125).

Right now, the BTC block reward is 12.5 coins. Consider that if blocks held 32MB, the transaction fees for a block could be 12.5 coins, with everyone paying just 40 sat/byte. (Or, with a 1MB block, the fees could still be 12.5 coins, if everyone paid 1250 sat/byte. We've had at least one such block already.) Miners have _no problem_ getting paid as the issuance decreases, and they already make a significant percentage from fees today. All they need is either fees or transaction volume to increase appropriately as the issuance goes down. The caps on those two things are, respectively, what a user is willing to pay, and how many transactions can be claimed in a single block.";1;0;False;suchClouds;dptulhx;Reminder: Core developers used to support 8-100MB blocks before they work for the bankers;7cuwyx;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7cuwyx/reminder_core_developers_used_to_support_8100mb/

You are bitching about the fact that Samson Mow never said: ""High fee is good because Bitcoin isn't for poor people.""

Did Samson Mow say ""1MB! 1MB! 1MB! 1MB! 1MB! 1MB! 1MB! 1MB!""?

Did it ever occur to your little brain that if I wrote ""Blockstream Core:"" instead of ""Samson Mow:"", then it was obviously not a direct quote of ""Samson Mow""?

It is necessary because it discourages future dumbfuckness. What kind of blind fuck would post bullshit like:

That said, I fully understand bitcoin transaction to be jumping up. I expect it to be going up 100% over a reasonable amount of time. But when it goes up 50x (not percent but times) over the span of few days, I suspect these are concerted spam.

>The problem with the Core proposed solution is that it is not ""add more capacity to the network"" but rather ""completely circumvent the network by only referencing back to it occasionally, taking your actual business off the network"". When you give someone the opportunity to profit from being a middleman, he will take it. That sounds way too much like middlemen meddling up a system for no reason. There's enough middlemen, payment processors, and people who take a cut along the way without the addition of an entirely new class of them.

Miners are a way the middlemen. Without their blessings we cannot move our crypto. Adding nodes from LN would just add another ""middlemen"". Even BCH is going to need to add this kind of middleman eventually. Remember in early days, spending BTC was almost free. Today BCH feels like this. But come 8 years from now, it won't feel like this with BCH anymore. Consider the fact that we are fast approaching  the 21 million limit. When that happens, miners are going to mine for the free. No more block rewards. So do you think Jihan and people are going to run massive data centers for measly network fees? I don't think so. They will only do so if fee makes it worth while. Transaction volume quaruples when no more block reward are given, and if fee remains affordable like BCH is now, then Jihan would be making only $.04 instead of $.01. Do you think he's gonna continue to mine and  confirm transaction. 

This problem will afflict all cryptos when block rewards are no more. Not just BCH or BTC.

"The problem was certainly pushed back. It became critical around 256kb and was pushed back at least 10x. Last I heard, tests of the fibre network showed some signs of delayed propagation again around 50x. Unfortunately, there are delays and packet losses that routinely occur on the internet that are exacerbated by block size but aren't eliminated with small blocks.

The new paper on even smaller blocks (starts with a 'G') might well give us another 3x, or the block size might no longer be dominating propagation delay. In particular, since blocks are being sent by simply referencing entries in the current mempool, delay in transaction propagation becomes just as limiting as delay in thin block propagation. As the number of transactions per block increases, so does the number of transactions one miner might include in a block that a second miner won't have before he receives the super high priority, directly transmitted (from pool to pool) block/list of pointers.

Anyway, this led to another round of quotes you can find with core devs agreeing to a 2x hard fork before they found a way to kludge a block size increase into their soft fork.

"Indeed, there are other good arguments against using the segwit soft fork approach. There's little question though that bitmain led a lot of mining opposition. Pretending that mining pools and operations don't have a vested interest in keeping their sole supply of mining hardware happy is a bit too simplistic for me.

Please cut the rhetoric about being lied to. I understand that overt asicboost has not been used on the bitcoin blockchain. I understand that jihan claims not to use any asicboost on the blockchain. I also note that antpool has a really remarkable signature of putting out blocks with transactions out of fee order. This is a signature that makes no sense and doesn't show up in other pools to remotely the same extent (i.e. some pools might accelerate transactions by putting them first, but they wouldn't have the scrambled transaction order that antpool routinely pumps out).

That is evidence. It's hardly conclusive, but nobody ever claimed to be that they could prove covert asicboost was being used (that's the whole reason it's called convert) so I disagree that I've been lied to!

Yes, segwit adoption has been far slower than I'd expected. It's been far slower than indicated by that self reported chart.

But now you're claiming that core developers are less credible on the technical details of Bitcoin scaling because a couple of them put together a list of big players, somebody else linked to a public statement from bittrex in a pull request saying they were ready for segwit, and a couple months later bittrex is still using legacy addresses for withdrawals and deposits?

But back to the OP, none of this remotely suggests that the core developers positions were influenced by VC funding. My comments certainly don't prove a negative, but that's my point. We don't have to get super hyperbolic, claiming someone is lying or lied to, or are being corrupted by bankers when they happen to change their position on scaling in response to a critical failure in Bitcoin mining decentralization everybody seems to have forgotten about!";1;1;False;HackerBeeDrone;dpt6hxp;Reminder: Core developers used to support 8-100MB blocks before they work for the bankers;7cuwyx;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7cuwyx/reminder_core_developers_used_to_support_8100mb/
First, 6 dollar fee per transaction is negligible amount if you entered into bitcoin in early days (and you will return something from a miner cause you are in tandem with him, aren’t you?).  Second, you can have different tactics to rise an average fee by fooling bad fee estimation algorithms: slow a blockchain, make a lot of spam transaction, some occasional empty blocks.

"Let’s suppose it is not.

Blockchain is a breakthrough technology, I think both you and I can agreed on that?

Speaking of Bitcoin, we know that once coin-issuance is slowed down (let’s say 19mln of 21mln are mined) mining won’t be subsidized solely by the system itself, instead users of the system should pay miners by means of a transaction fee (let’s call this original vision as this is quite a popular term nowadays).

Here we come to an interning situation: this is such a young brakethrough technology that there is no blockchain in existence that successfully surpassed it’s coin-issuance stage. We never observed such a blockchain.

We can compare this to a situation where the are thousands of startups with a lot of venture capital but none of them showed any profits yet. Everyone just believes that these startups will continue their existence somehow.

The core devs would say that they already raised the transaction limit to over 2x the pre segwit level. That's certainly not helping today, before exchanges and wallets fully implement use of segwit addresses, but it could kick in rather quickly when a large exchange enables it.

I started writing out why I'm frustrated with core developers for failing to embrace segwit 2x (by making it their 2x on their terms, not by simply pulling in code they're not happy with), but that's really beside the point.

The point is that tests seem to show the 2x enabled by segwit is safe, and that moving up to 10x would be unsafe.

Bigger blocks did cause centralization. Developers found a way to reduce block propagation time by referring to the mempool, but nobody thinks this eliminated the problem, it just vastly increased the block size at which miner profit seeking outweighs altruism in keeping the network decentralized.

"2nd layer solutions might be good, might be bad. As they arrive if they are good we will use them, if they are bad we will not. And not only BTC or BCH, every crypto would implement LN if they are any good.

Failing to scale today have nothing to do with that.

I think that LN will actually under deliver (same as segwit) and Core knows that but they must force users into Ln network and that is why they intentionally cripple BitCoin.  They are forcing users on LN for two possible reasons:

1) control (all transactions will go through controlled/censured hubs)
2) profit (Core will find a way to force users through tech they will first develop and monetize)

Both reasons are very bad.

Yeah it's pretty frustrating that Core couldn't just roll out 2mb and heal this divide. But maybe this split is showing that Bitcoin can't be everything to everyone. The present fees are fine for many Bitcoin 'users' as they don't really use it. They just treat it as a store of value or investment (like investing in another scarce resource like property) Personally I think Bitcoin makes a brilliant Store of Value, I never use it as cash or currency except as a party trick, and it doesn't bother me if it never is useful as cash as I have cash already and it works fine. What I don't have is an accessible investment vehicle which I can put any amount into ($10k or $10) and I know I own it and it can't be manipulated or seized and I can take it with me wherever I go.  So I guess Bitcoin is different things to different people which is why you're seeing this divide. ;14;5;False;rain-is-wet;dpsynw0;Reminder: Core developers used to support 8-100MB blocks before they work for the bankers;7cuwyx;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7cuwyx/reminder_core_developers_used_to_support_8100mb/

I doubt this as bitcoin *can* work on chain for everyone if we follow the ideas Satoshi proposed.

What do you mean by this? decentralization comes only from mining nodes, more users = more use = more miners will come onboard in many places around the world = greater decentralization; while full blocks mean only very few people can use bitcoin at all.

Satoshi laid out the full design of bitcoin, where all people could transact P2P in a trustless manner on a decentralized network and some 100,000 miners all around the world each with big data center style buildings would support the network of many small fee transactions

Now look at Bitcoin Cash (BCH)'s mempool:

All transactions in Bitcoin Cash are cleared EVERY BLOCK regardless of how much fee you pay.

You can pay $0.2 fee or $10000 fee, it'll be cleared just the same, the same cannot be said for Bitcoin Core, where high fee tx gets cleared first.

"I don't think bankers care about block-size. The many bankers don't even know about block-size and why that matters or doesn't matter. Bankers are supposedly going to own bitcoin. And bankers are going to trade and make money on trade. Having smaller block size works against them. It's preposterous the same industry that goes the financial crisis because they wanted to maximize their profit is going to work against their best interest by keeping block-size small. Having bigger block-size would benefit bankers. They can trade more and make more. 

Or perhaps you think bankers are going to become miners. And keep the block-size small will increase transaction fee and the bankers-cum-miners are going to get those transaction fee? The same can be said about bitcoin cash. Suppose BCH becomes the defacto and the price goes up to $50000/bitcoin. Not only bankers but more new people are going to come in and flood the market with transactions. And the fee will increase. (BCH doesn't have fixed fee for infinity as far as I know.) What happens when BCH has 32mb block and that too is filled? Well come to the same problem. 

I just picked a random BCH transaction - 9092b0e2dd3875b331ddcef1ac276c380ce951dcebb1498d719f873bfb38690f
It has a fee of 0.001132542819499341. That works out to about USD-1.52  (BCH @ $1350). If BCH is at @ $2700, then the fee is $3. If it's @ $5400, then fee is $6. If it's at $11000, fee is at @12. 

Now I picked a random BTC transaction - 31e14d85b4fcc64022c3156cfcedb9df93f484845d93f5f3e3bde905be300f98
It has fee of 0.003. That works out to about USD-19.5 with BTC @ $6500. If btc was $13.50. The fee would be $4. But we know for a fact that the fee is so high now because of consented effort to spam the mempool of BTC. Had there not been this effort, the fee would have been this much. The evidence of that is this: Between last week and this week, BTC didn't gain 50x adoption. Amazon and Walmart or some other big merchant didn't start accepting BTC. And suddely 50 times more people didn't start doing BTC transaction. If you go through the various exchanges, the daily volume of btc trade didn't jump up 50 fold.

At this point, the argument for bch with the block-size and transaction fee is stupid. It's like Republican party and Obamacare. Since the inception of Obamacare, the Republican party has done anything everything to make it not work. And then complain about it not working and then pass more rules and policies to make it not work. 

Same for BCH and BTC. If you are actively making BTC not work through spam transactions, then you cannot complain about it not working. Because you are making it not work. 

Don't ban me. I'm speaking my mind. I hodl both BTC and BCH. Whichever one wins in the end, I win. My ultimate desire would be for both BCH to continue and BTC to continue and for both to go to the moon. Because together that would mean, I am going to Jupiter. :)

"Nothing can be a store of value for long if has no intrinsic value. The intrinsic value of Bitcoin is that you can use it for payments. Of course it is also good that your funds can't be seized, but plenty of coins offer that, including Bitcoin Cash. So without maintaining its usefulness for everyday payments, Bitcoin is losing a lot of its intrinsic value compared to other coins. If that situation persists (when is the lightning network coming again? and will it even work? who knows?), Bitcoin will not be a good 'store of value' for very long.

The people you are listening to on 'store of value' are not economists. I suggest you completely extricate yourself from these forums, and do some pure research on economics for a while — specifically when it comes to the economics of currencies. Read deeply on the subject without any influence from any kind of bitcoiners: then you can know that you are not getting intentionally biased info. After you believe you know how currencies work economically, come back to these forums and evaluate the arguments in light of your newfound knowledge.

"I do post a lot on /r/bitcoin , and I understand some of the sentiments and views, that said, I do not understand the following:

* If we do 2MB blocks now, does it necessarily mean we HAVE to increase 100 petabyte blocks sometime? Why does this have to be a slippery slope? Apparently, when the 2nd layer solutions come, we'll begin to see empty blocks, and maybe then we can talk about scaling down, but I doubt it, the 2nd layer settles on the blockchain anyway, and sometime down the line, the block chain itself won't be able to support the 2nd layer settlements, as the usage increases.

* For daily use, we may need 2nd layer solutions, as the block chain doesn't scale while still holding the same value and principles. But, it's not as if Bitcoin is clogged up because people are getting in line Starbucks, so we'll have to, at some point, increase the block size, just to be able to catch up with the current method of use, and in future, to be able to settle what goes on in the 2nd layers. Why not do it quickly, and now?

* The assertion that if there weren't spammers, this wouldn't be problem. Hay, is the solution to spam 1MB blocks, and keeping it that way would reduce spam? I guess not. Why not make it 2MB and make spammers bleed more if that's the case, at least honest transactions will more likely go through.

"You won't be banned here for your opinions, regardless of their popularity.

What you are failing to see is that Bitcoin transaction demand is _not_ a constant. The amount of people who want to transact Bitcoin varies _heavily_ each day, and _explodes_ whenever there is significant price movement. The backlogs form themselves as a natural consequence of the network constantly running nearly at maximum capacity. Zero new users and zero spam is required to create these circumstances, and you can trivially verify that they have happened in times of high volume... for all of 2017, long before BCH existed.

It is a similar concept to the average RPM of a car motor being under 2000 for any given drive, but there being times where the motor must hit 3000 or 4000 RPM. The Bitcoin network develops massive backlogs due to natural variance if it operates without sufficient headroom. Headroom has been added twice in the past as needed, and Bitcoin survived just fine, with headroom to make it additional years. Now BCH has done it a third time. Either you create enough space in the ledger for every reasonable transaction, or less and less types of transactions will qualify as reasonable.

The problem with the Core proposed solution is that it is not ""add more capacity to the network"" but rather ""completely circumvent the network by only referencing back to it occasionally, taking your actual business off the network"". When you give someone the opportunity to profit from being a middleman, he will take it. That sounds way too much like middlemen meddling up a system for no reason. There's enough middlemen, payment processors, and people who take a cut along the way without the addition of an entirely new class of them.

"There are 2 separate issues:

1) Currently it's people paying miners $100+ fees hoping they'd get through first.

2) It's also in Blockstream's road map to make Bitcoin unusable with 1MB blocks, then offer patented side channel services and charge people fee for using it.

"My wife is a marketing manager with a lot of experience in major companies, so I'll be getting her input on strategies. I agree that targeted social media advertising is extremely cost effective. This is certainly something we need to look into using. There's a reason all the ICOs are using it.

I've run two of my own companies so I have some knowledge of marketing.

Most importantly though, is this is a community effort. We can pool our resources and pull off something amazing.

>Shit - do what the Bitcoin community never bothered to do: hire someone to make an actual commercial and crowd fund the money necessary to get it on television and other media outlets. If its done well enough, you'd have no problem getting the money to buy ad spots.

"You should get BCH if ""I should be able to have money that is supranational, secure, instant, with low usage costs, and for which no one can say when or where I can spend it"" sounds right to you.

The majority of BTC mining is also in China.

"Priorities.  There is no better marketing than being listed in the fiat -> crypto gateways.  We need Coinbase and Gemini to support deposits and withdrawals.  I will have to reconsider my BCH investment if Coinbase comes out by Jan 1 and only lets you withdraw.

Bitcoin Cash has six months or less to complete these objectives:

1 - Get listed on all major fiat exchange gateways in the States and South Korea.

2 - Get most major merchants to follow OverStock.com's switch to Bitcoin Cash.  If BCH is the blockchain for the users, we need to get these customers right away.  There needs to be a plan with funding to achieve this.

Lower fees *per individual transaction* is not bad for a miner, if the total number of transactions increases enough to compensate.

Scenario 2: $1 fee per transaction and 15,000 transactions in a block = $15k total fees

"The censorship issue is something i raised on /r/bitcoin , it seems like they are loosening it up a little, regardless, yes rampant censorship betrays the trust of the people.

Yes that is true, and that is why there is Bitcoin Cash, a fork for those who think the alternative is settled.

At the same time. I do sympathize with the argument for decentralization . A lot of the big block supporters seem “wreckless” in their pursuit of short term gains for their businesses. I hate Bitpay, they are the representative of everything i dislike about the current system. Paypal has tens of thousands of my money frozen. Bitpay regulates it’s merchants, something that follows Paypal’s path.

Jihan does not seem to care that he is monopolizing Bitcoin’s mining in China or that he can hold the network hostage when he wishes. 

These examples are just a few where I feel, the big blockers are supporting the kinds of views Bitcoin was created to remove. Too big to fail, a few people controlling the entire network. If we follow Jihan’s model we might as well go with the PBOC instead.

Big blockers also do not seem to be concerned that a bunch of huge Bitcoin companies and miners came together for a secret agreement in a room (we already forgot about 2008, bankers lobbying to remove derivative regulations?) to change the code. 

In comparison, the only thing Blockstream has done is lack empathy and ability to compromise. Whatever people say, Blockstream may be impeding progress on Bitcoin, but in my mind they are not short term profit seeking.

Censorship resistance is a key value proposition of Bitcoin, and if we lose this property for short term financial gains then we have just returned to the system we were trying to get away from.

Regarding the blocksize increase, i see no reason why a small increase will cause any problems, other than fix them. This is indeed a failure from core, however as i said, because they support decentralization that itself is a worthy goal in my opinion.

"We need both a currency and a store of value, the question is, is it better to have those things separate? Nobody really knows the answer to this, but people SEEM to be using Bitcoin as a store of value more than a currency. Bitcoin Cash maybe the layer 2, we have been waiting for.

Remember this whole idea that the coin value is linked to it’s use case as a currency has never been proven (we are at the frontier here, so who knows). 

Gold has very little use case for normal people, if we measure by use case. The USD is by far the most USEFUL currency in existence, but the value remains on a flatline, and that is a good thing, a currency should not be volatile like an asset class like stocks.

The world wants both, and if both can exist on one currency that would be ideal indeed, however we have no idea how the economics of the future works.

Well every day that BCH is around is also another day btc is around so I don't see what days around has to do with anything. Btc is backwards compatible with every client released since the beginning, it is the chain the economic majority is following and if the economic majority want a hard fork they will need to implement and begin using that chain immediately at the split point. You can't just fork some new chain and expect every who has invested in btc since the split point to just lose all of their money.

"Discard all the conspiracies, and offer benefit of the doubt to the extreme, that Maxwell, Back, Dashjr, Todd ...  all these guys might just genuinely be following what they really believe is the right path.   Set all that aside and assume good faith.    Even grant them perhaps a ""the congestion we have now and the lost businesses and users is worth it in the end"", and simply take a look at what their plan is.   

The plan is to create these second layer solutions, and sell the technology to corporations who will then allow their customers to have blockchain-derivative tokens which they can move about.   They'll move them within the walled garden of the companies 2nd layer, and probably for some fee be able to move them to other companies walled gardens.   If you're rich enough, you can even move them on-chain to your own wallet.    Even taking my own on-chain bias out, I think this is not a controversial description of their intent.   

So now you've got Venmo, Paypal, Apple/Google Pay, Exchanges selling you some product which moves a token around off the blockchain.   Consumers who've never owned Bitcoin will have an app on their phone that lets them move some money to their friends or pay for a coffee.  They'll be able to move their token to an exchange where they can gamble on the price of assets.   In many ways it really will improve the user experience.

But what these users will not get is financial freedom.   The government will track all of their transactions even more effectively than they do with VISA, and be able to confiscate their money, or blacklist anyone who they deem a threat.   Most people will probably be moving tokens which are tied to fiat, so their currency hegemony will also remain unthreatened.     This is the vision behind the small block, off-chain solutions.   

So while I'm also prone to conspiratorial thoughts, even the non-conspiracy is NOT what I signed up for.   I'm not against such a thing existing, that's fine.   Its better than VISA and Paypal are today.   It'll probably make it a bit easier to on-ramp to freedom based cryptos than it is today (though also will make it easier for them to monitor the onramp.)      The case to be made to convert small blockers is to simply make them see clearly the vision that is driving core.   No need for a boogieman when the actual plan speaks for itself.

"Core has been doing stuff, they've just been ignoring the elephant in the room.  Let me explain...

Open source software is developed by volunteers.  That means people work on problems that interest them.  An open source project also has a lead maintainer, the main person who decides which patches should be accepted and which shouldn't.  That started as Satoshi, then it was Gavin Andresen, then it was Wladimir van der Laan.  

We go back to 2012.  Gavin has stepped down as lead maintainer, he wants to write code, not do the cat-herding that is being a lead maintainer.  Wladimir becomes lead maintainer.  
Gavin points out that scaling is a problem and we should increase the block size.  Other devs point out this will take a hard fork and has potential to cause problems.  Gavin says it's important so we should do it anyway.  One or two other Core devs say 'I oppose this change'.  Wladimir says 'this is a change to consensus rules, and we don't have a consensus, so we can't make the change.  Keep talking among yourselves'.  And thus the can gets kicked down the road.  

Now for the record, I understand Wladimir's thinking here.  He was playing the role of a custodian, not the role of a leader.  That's perfectly valid, it just wasn't helpful here, especially when some of the anti-hardfork people preventing consensus were people with more extreme views like LukeJr who felt the block size limit should be *reduced*.  

Thus things remained the same for the next few years- because there wasn't a complete consensus, Core wouldn't agree to change the consensus rules.  

That's not to say Core did nothing.  For example, libsecp256k1 (try saying that 5 times fast) replaced OpenSSL as the crypto library, which led to a notable speed increase.  However the real problem didn't get any attention because it had no fix without consensus and there would never be consensus because some Core devs felt the block size limit should not be changed yet or should only be changed with years of advance notice.

While if something has an application as in: I need bitcoin transaction to work and work smoothly, my business depend on it. 

For bitcoin to be actually used by the masses it will need: 

- To have a benefit that current payment systems don't have, this can be easy of use, low fees, less control by one party, etc etc

- an easy way to get in too it, the higher the fees the higher the threshold to actually buy small amounts and use it as a way of paying for stuff online

- Zero confirmation need to be always around, yes you risk getting scammed but at least it makes bitcoin usable for small payment. 


Yes I know there are other crypto's that do these things better then bitcoin but bitcoin has a massive network effect and an enormous amount of investment in mining equipment. This all protect the system cause it's valuable. But if it becomes over protective just because a few are worried they will loose value ... then it's like an auto immune disease where the body attacks healty parts of itself trying to ""protect"" itself against stuff that is actually good for the body and not bad.

"Essentially the tradeoffs come between:

1. First mover advantages
2. Costs of running a fullnode
3. Cost of transaction fees.

The whole ""decentralization"" vs ""centralized"" coins is a myth.  I can go into detail if you want (but ask a specific question so I know where you're coming from).

The real key here is the first mover advantage.  Just looking at raw facts, Ethereum is: Faster; More flexible; Cheaper; More reliable; Cheaper to run; Easier and faster to sync; More decentralized in several ways.

The reason Bitcoin is bigger, more likely to be discussed, and worth more is because... Bitcoin is 6 years older than Ethereum.  Bitcoin has the Bitcoin name.  Bitcoin has had more time to get organized and more time to prove itself.

But that's fading.  A 6 year head start on a 50 year timeline is nothing.  A 6 year headstart on an 8 year timeline is huge.

Bitcoin must compete.  It doesn't have to be **better** than Ethereum, it just has to not lose first place.  If Bitcoin loses first place to Ethereum, then it **must** be better.

Now going back to the trade offs...

The cost of running a fullnode and the cost of transaction fees are intricately related as Bitcoin gets bigger and bigger.  Fundamentally transactions are bytes, and bytes cost money.  Unfortunately Core is/has taken this perspective to ridiculous levels.  A fullnode can be run for $3 a month.  I've done it, and there's lots of posts on how to do it for about that much.  The **median** transaction fee 2 days ago was $13 and the average was $19.  The two-week moving average transaction fee is $8 and median is $5.5.  It is now costing normal people twice as much to send a SINGLE transaction as it costs them to run a fullnode for an entire MONTH.

Fortunately, not everyone needs to run a fullnode.  They are not critical.  The network needs a certain minimum number to protect itself against DDOSes and sybil attacks, but we're already well beyond that point.  Beyond that, if you are transacting less than $450,000 of value, you are completely economically protected to transact trustlessly with SPV clients.  SPV clients don't download every transaction and they do scale very well, but they DO validate things and the only attacks on them are well understood and easy to defend against.

Does that answer some of your questions?";1;0;False;JustSomeBadAdvice;dptmtpk;Confessions of a Core Supporter;7csoxe;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7csoxe/confessions_of_a_core_supporter/

"> they are loosening it up a little

The only relevant thing is, the entire camp was completely unable to act against censorship when they benefited from it. Before that happened, I thought Core was a regular dispersed open-source group.

What censors do after today cannot change what has been revealed so far.

> Big blockers also do not seem to be concerned that a bunch of huge Bitcoin companies and miners came together for a secret agreement in a room to change the code. 

I am uneasy even discussing in these terms. What next? I tell you that the CEO/civilian/President from Blockstream did this far earlier than ""big blockers""? Which is incidentally the case? Come on.

Whether you know it or not, people will make deals. We are in the know of the above because publicizing it served a purpose. Let's not become tools.

> These examples are just a few where I feel, the big blockers are supporting the kinds of views Bitcoin was created to remove. Too big to fail, a few people controlling the entire network. If we follow Jihan’s model we might as well go with the PBOC instead.

I don't get this part.

What is Jihan's model and what is Blockstream/Core doing to prevent it? As far as I can tell, they have not done a single thing to prevent chip manufacture monopolization. They have also not integrated any of the proposed solutions to prevent mining pool consolidation.

How is people telling others to not move out from Coinbase and trade on GDAX to avoid fees somehow against big business? As far as I can tell, every decentralized use case, from colored coins to crowd-funded development, is simply removed. All is left is BitPay and Coinbase, the bodies you claim they are fighting against?

I think the vision you support is very healthy, but you need to do the measurements independently instead of relying on what people claim.

"Cause bitcoin core has a bunch of weaknesses that are now being attacked. That' how these systems with so much open information work. They get more resilient by actively being attacked. Because it's all new, nobody knows about weaknesses untill they are revealed by being attacked. Then they can be fixed. But this is way beyond just code. I don't belief Bitcoin has many technical weaknesses but it does have economical and political weaknesses. 


Just think what would happen if the rumor is spreading that bitfinex is in trouble. Let's say a large enough number of people get worried about their bitcoin and start transferring their funds away. Now the mempool becomes full. People redo their transactions with a higher fee (replace by fee), still stuck! Higher fees! Miners switch back to bitcoin cause of the insane high fees. 

These are all weaknesses in the entire ecosystem that powerful players (like Roger Ver) can attack and therefor will attack. 

Bitcoin Core refuses to adapt to any other vision but their own but they don't know what vision is the right one, nobody knows. This is all unknown territory and it's more then just technical code. Bitcoin as code is just dumb code. It's people that make the code come to life by believing in it and running it. So code can't save anything when code is just manipulation of symbols that only human beings give a meaning too. 

And so the political and economical aspects of bitcoin are really important. As important as the technical code. We humans have learned about different political systems and different economical systems and econsystems. Now that old knowledge needs to used and integrated with this new technology that is quite a game changer. 

This is where things went wrong. Bitcoin rapidly became highly political and even religious and cultist in nature. 

I wonder if we will ever see something like bitcoin suicide. Cult leaders when thing go wrong convincing their followers to blow it all up. 

Bitcoin has had great tech leaders but now it needs political and economical leaders. Otherwise it's first place in crypto will be taken over by communities that are less devided and just lag a  bit behind bitcoin, look at what it is doing wrong, fix that and do it right. 

It's nice to be number two just like it's nice to be the second born son. You look at your older brother and learn from what he does wrong and then you don't have to make the same mistakes.

Bitcoin core refuses to learn. It's not teachable. It does not differentiate between making a political compromise and a technical compromise. And that is going to end up being  very costly. 

Ever since WWII we live in a world where consensus is engineered.   Just read some of Noam Chomsky his work. Or watch Adam Curtis ""Century of Self"".

Even the great hero Aaron Swartz wrote that his life changed after learning about how consensus can be engineered. 

And so words like ""centralization"" and ""consensus"" are just words being thrown around without much meaning behind what people are saying. 

There is no such thing as machine consensus. Machines don't care one way or the other. They don't struggle when you try to shut them down. Human consensus is a fickle thing because if you can influence how people think then you can influence what it is they think they want. After that consensus is not consensus  anymore, it has been bypassed and compromised. """"But the people want this!"" That's why democracy has been dead for a long time and most people stopped caring about it after learning that in the current system there vote has no power what so ever.

"One consequence of having prevented scaling while we wait is that all the new people piling money in now have bought into a totally different vision.   They see Bitcoin as a way to get rich and increase their fiat wealth.  They buy in to the ""store of value"" concept, where it doesn't matter if you use on-chain transactions.   Blockchain is just a word, no meaning.

As I'm sure you well remember, the mantra used to be ""Once bitcoin succeeds, you won't care what the price is.   You'll only spend Bitcoin.""     I never hear anyone say that anymore.   I'd be lying if I said I didn't get excited when the fiat value of my crypto rises.   Its still a fiat world, after all.   But for me that price rise represented more than just my net worth in fiat.  It meant the chance of the dream of a Bitcoin future was that much close to a reality.

"Moreso disagreement by a few leads to 'no consensus' leads to lack of acting.  

The analogy I like to use- we're all on a bus that's headed toward a cliff at 60mph.  Half of us say we should turn left, the other half say we should turn right, but we can't overall agree, so the bus driver says 'nope until you guys agree we're just gonna maintain status quo and nothing will change'.  
This of course ignores the fact that if we do nothing a change will happen, namely we will drive off the cliff.  

Jeff Garzik [wrote a great piece back in 2015](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-December/011973.html) about how lack of action causes change.  It includes the semi-famous quote ""Without exaggeration, I have never seen this much disconnect between user

"> perhaps they are not even computer scientists but just look like one?

I believe that many Core developers and their toadies like Theymos genuinely thought that no one would have the audacity or even the skills to actually fork away from them. They are egotistical and haughty people who think they are the best crypto developers in the world. Then, after the fork occurred, the narrative became ""well, BCH will keep trending downward until it's worth $5, free airdropped money"". Wrong again.

They assume actual users of bitcoin will suffer congestion and high fees, just to wait for the promised land of true 2nd-layer solutions. Again, not true - people will just swap their funds into other usable cryptocurrencies  long before then.

I further believe that even if a fully operational Lightning Network + software were delivered tomorrow on the BTC network, few people would actually use it.

What I'm trying to say is that there are many skilled cryptographers and coders in this world, but only few who would be able to understand economic incentives so well as to come up with something like Bitcoin.
Actually some of current Core devs originally mocked the idea and said it couldn't work.

You should always think yourself and try to understand what makes the system work. As an anarchist you should always know to question authority. Often times you lack knowledge in some field and have to trust someone who knows better, but atleast you should understand what should be known.

Mechanics don't design aeroplanes for a reason. They might be most skilled in maintaning one though.

"Great post that I've also been through recently myself. I used to joke about and dump on BCH and me and my friends would laugh as we would short the coin on exchanges. Kinda wish I had just held on to it now but I've increased my position in BCH. Finding out that AXA had ties to block stream was what got me really skeptical. We were supposed to move away from that banks and big finance but instead our developers ended up on their payroll. 

I remember investing in a company a while back that were streaming movies and shows thinking it was going to be the next Netflix but all the while I was using Netflix because the other service just wasn't usable. Over time the company decayed and essentially closed down. I learned that if I'm not going to use it then why would someone else? BTC is starting to feel that way now. With the High fees, the backlog of unconfirmed transactions, the network speed and a scaling solution that it is almost 100% dependant on a tech that we don't even know will work on such a scale and it's not remotely close. 18 months is an estimate but it could be more. Does that mean the only thing we can do with BTC in the next 18+months is to just hold it? I was so confident BTC would hit 10k early next year but now I am not so sure.

"I'm much more a nerd than a capitalist or anarchist, but I still think full blocks are no good.  The protocol is simply not designed for handling constantly full blocks.

One doesn't have to resort to conspiracy theories (though, my favorite conspiracy theory is that there exists some PR consultancy company working on both sides of the schism, actively doing their best to fuel the conflict and split the community).  Let's just say that there exist this ""Maxwell vision"" where the blockchain is thin and slim, with regular payments going over sidechains, lightning or similar.  With all on-chain transactions using the RBF-flag, and with smart wallet software cramming extra transactions into the existing RBF'ed unconfirmed transaction things may work out - it will be a real ""fee market"" like he wants it to be.  I must admit, it does appeal a bit to me in a nerdy way - but even if it technically is a small change (miners could always honor RBF without any changes done to the protocol, and the 1 MB hard limit has been there since the very early days), functionally it's a very big change.

Also, consider what's at stake?  The network effect is very strong, there is *no point* to have cool tech available as long as the network effect is missing.  Consider PGP (GPG), it was very cool tech back in 1991 when it was released, and although it's no longer the bleeding edge tool for encrypting and signing email, it's still the best alternative widely available - and nobody is using it!  We had our golden moment where bitcoin payments were working much more smoothly than credit card payments, we do need bitcoin payments to work better than credit card payments to reach the critical mass adoption.

"This is one of the best posts I've read so far on bitcoin's development, direction and culture. Complemented by some very informative comments by other participants. It's posts and comments like this that make trawling Reddit a productive activity.

I've been involved with computers since the Apple IIe and DOS days. But am very new with cryptos. I'm ashamed to admit that for a few years, I had totally dismissed Bitcoin and cryptos as ""a ponzi scheme"", ""a fad"", ""bound to fail"" and such. Without even doing some basic research first. How wrong I was! And especially in the blockchain technology that is even more impactful than cryptos.

But anyway... I have been rather confused by the very nasty spat involving the bitcoin and BCH people. The Core supporters keep condemning big block, BCH supporters as ""not keeping to Satoshi's vision"" and thereby trying to seize the moral high ground. Talking as if they are the chosen ones. It's like those religious extremists who insist they are the true adherents of Prophet Muhammad or Jesus Christ, and anyone who disagree with them are enemies of God.

I believe that the world will move towards what is better when it comes to cryptos. In the sense that the winning crypto is one that adapts to the world. Not one that demands the world take the initiative. Bitcoin may be the number one right now. But it might later turn into what MySpace is - the Number One social media network...of 2008. 

As I see it, BCH stands a better chance of wider usage worldwide. The Core supporters keep underestimating the expertise of BCH's developers. If interest keeps growing, I'll bet more talented people will get involved in BCH. And with it being more responsive to real world demands, BCH will pull ahead. And be widely acknowledged as ""The Real Bitcoin"". ";1;1;False;cendana287;dpt7ksz;Confessions of a Core Supporter;7csoxe;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7csoxe/confessions_of_a_core_supporter/

"What a pleasant read, thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts, I doubt you would have been able to post thought provoking posts like this on /r/Bitcoin. 
My 2 cents on the matter: 
BTC core chose inaction at a time of uncertainly. However, that does not deprive them of the option of making future changes that will bring BTC up to speed again. 
The market cap for BTC and crypto in general is still relatively small, and thus widely open to manipulation by the likes of Jihan Wu and Roger Ver, who hold large amounts of BTC and have a mining equipment business to run, which I can only assume needs to be kept profitable. Bitmain was selling its S9 models strictly for BCC, a lot of people bought them for around 4-5 BCC a piece, and now got screwed because 2 weeks later those same people pumped the coin to where 1 BCC now buys you 1 Antminer S9. 


A lot of us try to ignore the phenomenal surge that has taken place since summer, whining that BTC is « back under 6k » , while just a few months everyone was amazed it reached 3k. 
Crypto may be worlds apart from Fiat, but the human factor of quickly getting used to abnormal profits and artificially creating circumstances to repeat such scenarios is identical..

"Just a few things though:

1) The core devs never agreed to the NY agreement, but they did fail the HK agreement. The devs were left out of it, after they failed their first agreement.

2) Clearly the core devs hate capitalists, but fear of them is a healthy thing. How do you know these first batch of companies won't become centralized evil they sought to destroy, what if you are looking at Netscape before Chrome, sure Netscape advanced internet browsing immeasurably, but that does not mean the creators should obtain mythical ""supreme leader"" like worship. 

I do think Roger Ver has been unfairly treated, and has been character assasinated.

3) The common argument I see thrown around is that lots of miners love Bitcoin and want a blocksize increase, that is incorrect, a FEW miners own the entire mining network in China, that was never part of the plan. When one guy like Jihan can singlehandedly dictate the consensus, that is wrong. There are thus about 5-7 miners vs the consensus of tens of thousands of users and devs.

**4) This reddit and the Bitcoin Cash side should STOP hanging out and endorsing with Craig Wright (A fraud that stole taxpayers money from Australia), as he is one of the primary reasons core supporters think Bitcoin Cash is backed by illegitimate people.**

5) The argument you are looking at is purely ideological, the core argument is that Bitcoin is a store of value more than it is currency, current prices and mainstream internet suggests so. Core supporters are betting on L2 technologies like Lightning. Whether Bitcoin is a store of value AND a currency, isn't settled. Do you pay people with gold or your house? At some point gold was used as a currency, but then it quickly became a ""store of value"" in history. 

As much as people hate it, but there is at least a POSSIBILITY of Bitcoin being worth so much, because it's hugely illiquid (high fees, slow transaction).

6) Having two versions of Bitcoin is GOOD, you can choose who to align with, this is not a zero sum game in my opinion, besides so much infrastructure is built on the original Bitcoin, it will take time for Bitcoin Cash to catch up. Should L2 for Bitcoin Core fail to materialize, we have a 8mb fix already in action.

7) Blockstream's influence on core code is debatable, but core's teams lack of empathy is a universally agreed problem. The Segwit2x showed their lack of political ability to compromise.";6;2;False;slowsynapse;dpsoct9;Confessions of a Core Supporter;7csoxe;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7csoxe/confessions_of_a_core_supporter/

"I see a ""nerd"" theme in this post - and just want to point out that if you're not a ""nerd"" of the relevant kind yourself, then you can't really identify the ""real nerds"" in an information war.

Greg Maxwell is an interesting case. Clever guy for sure. I myself am not a ""crypto-nerd"", more of a ""sysadmin-nerd"" or ""embedded-dev-nerd"", so there is a lot of overlap. I saw a few comments from gmaxwell that were really condescending - which does not make them wrong, I can be condescending at times when I really feel like it - but they were not 100% factually correct, and that rubbed me the wrong way.

Clearly, Gavin Andresen and Jeff Garzik are also nerds. I'd say Greg Maxwell is a kind of nerd, but in a less pure way, with more ego-driven motivations than purely technical.

There's also a lot of non-technical fanboys on both sides, which always muddies the waters - you can always criticize the other sides fanboys and it's not really a ""strawman"" but it also isn't really countering the best arguments of the other side.

"You're literally the user that I've been trying to stand up for for the past two years of fighting small blockers. Go back and read my comments, or just a random few of them. Even right from the start. It's definitely repetitive, but sometimes you have to repeat yourself to be heard with new users entering every day.

I bought my first coins around 2012-2013. Before creating my account, I was a Reddit lurker for years. I only started to get involved in the conversation when I saw the compromise and cooperation going south on BitcoinCore's team when Gavin was lead developer but stepping down. I knew something was wrong. It just felt bad in my gut what some of these new developers like Greg Maxwell seemed more interested in the prestige of being Bitcoin's top developer than actually fostering Bitcoin's growth. They were fighting against what the original developers like Gavin Andresen, Jeff Garzik and others were proposing as good, sound ideas for scaling. Greg was seeking power and control whereas Gavin was stepping down selflessly to spend time with his family. I just saw two different motives and knew immediately that one was dishonest and immature.

Since I've started I've always been true to my gut. Like you, I believed in Bitcoin even before the 2013 ramp up and Mt. Gox crash. I was buying at $100, $500, $1000, then when the crash happened, I continued to buy and hold. Sometimes you imagine a possible future that others aren't able to see. I've been lucky enough to have been gifted some of that sight and it has been painful watching people trying to destroy Bitcoin, not from outside, but from within it's own development team. 

I've seen BitcoinCore go from a respectable group of veteran developers into an immature, censorship-driven insular group with just one or two people in control. They disseminate messages from the top down and those messages are then filtered throughout r/bitcoin, bitcoin.org, bitcointalk and, all of the sudden now, a bunch of twitter and social media trolls which I assume are paid astroturfing campaigns. This change happened exactly around the time when Blockstream was founded and became involved. Greg Maxwell, Blockstream's CTO has openly admitted to being BitcoinCore's code gatekeeper. New developers, new ideas, are not welcome. The power-hungry seeker got his position of power and now he has an army of social media manipulators working to keep him there. They criticize anyone that goes against what Greg says, no matter who it is or what they've done for Bitcoin in the past. They have no respect for Satoshi's original vision or the hard work that was put in for years before they even knew about Bitcoin.

In many ways I was lucky to be here and see this unfold before the heavy censorship started. Us that have been here witnessed how people were silenced just for speaking their minds. Control got tighter and tighter until literally saying anything at all they disagree with, even if it is within the moderation rules, will get you banned at r/bitcoin. Bitcoin was supposed to be about financial freedom, but for some reason they don't think people should discuss it freely? 

This is an attack. BitcoinCore has been taken over by attackers, trying to destroy the technology that many thought they were responsible for fostering. Along that path, they've blamed everyone and everything except themselves and the deliberately Bitcoin-crippling decisions they've made. At first I thought it was accidental negligence, but then it became so deliberate and anti-common sense that I knew it was being driven by some other force.

That's why we're here. Bitcoin Cash is a branch without Segwit that aims to keep Bitcoin's original vision: peer to peer electronic cash for everyone. Not just the rich, no middle-men bankers and no governmental inflation/control. It's for the people. It is an idea that cannot be stopped.

"> Why did you so quickly renege on the NY agreement once you got what you wanted; segwit. Only dishonest pussies do that kind of thing.

They didn't renege on the agreement because they never signed it! They weren't there, no one asked them for their opinion, and from the beginning they were saying they don't agree to it. They didn't abandon any agreement, they just didn't surrender and agree to something they resisted from the beginning.

- miners: no, let's increase block size
- Core: no, let's activate Segwit

"I agree that having two competing versions is good. Although, you did not mention rampant censorship, denial of service and social attacks, etc. which can help the competition fail regardless of merit. A few points, though.

No matter of how Bitcoin 'behaves', some think it *should be* a currency.  This is a completely separate discussion.  We came in to Bitcoin when it had practically zero value, in order to help solve the world's problems.  Even if I was convinced that it would make me even richer, I don't see it as a reason to abandon that goal.

I used to see the hodlers as an eternal-September-like peculiarity that are not resourceful enough to cause an imbalance, but the current Core groupthink seized it as an opportunity to ossify control and rest is history.

Second, we can't know what Bitcoin's *nature* is, if it is not allowed to be different things.  Currently, there are no technical reasons to limit the block size to 1MB, so what has been done is forcing Bitcoin to become one thing, while at the same time propagandizing some scaling rhetoric (with no scientific basis) that discourages alternative opinions in alternative projects.  Which makes overcoming the barriers even more difficult.

> Do you pay people with gold or your house?

I never did but saw it happen.  Gold is used for commerce much more than what first-worlders think.  It was used even more, but nowadays laws are emerging everywhere against paying off-bank for real estate (or anything with a high value in some places).  Same problem with above.

"Hi Crispyanit,

Be careful as you buy and sell small amounts these days because fees are high. https://bitcoinfees.info

Don't know when you were doing those transactions, but this problem really escalated in last couple of days. Bitcoin to be useful as a currency should be settled in couple minutes and fees should be under $0.20.  Currently fees are $5-$10-$15 and you could be waiting for days for you transaction to settle.

Yes, bitcoin cash is instant. However BCH have much lower brand recognition. I don't know what will happen in future in terms of their value. My best advice for you is to buy both.

The trader dismounted from his camel and drew near, offering his canteen, the fluids jostling inside.

Okay. So where does it end? People keep forking the bitcoin protocol and altering it to make it more favourable for the miners in order to steal market share away from the other chains. Are users just supposed to chase the miners from forked coin to forked coin to whatever chain is most favourable for the miners??? The users have to make a stance at some point and say NO to all these forks eventually. Otherwise it just leads to the miners having full control of how to manipulate the protocol however they want, in order to make things most favourable for them, the small number of big business miners.

">Bitcoin Core with it's whopping 3 transactions a second. Bitcoin Cash with it's whopping 24 transactions a second.

The 8MB limit on BCH is just the current default setting for various clients.  The limit doesn't really matter provided it's kept comfortably above the current market equilibrium block size so as not to act as a binding economic constraint. (This was how the 1-MB limit functioned on the BTC chain for the first six or so years of its existence.)  No one who supports Cash is fetishizing 8-MB as some kind of sacred and ""immutable"" ""consensus rule"" that defines the one true Bitcoin Cash chain.  

>Visa with it's whopping 24,000 transactions a second. Why are we even trying to compete for this market?

You mean the market for money? Because we recognize that an arbitrary limit on transactional capacity is a direct attack on Bitcoin's money property and basic value proposition.  https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6emrtd/three_ways_an_arbitrary_capacity_limit_harms/

>Wouldn't you rather bitcoin stay decentralized? 

Yes, and that's why increasing its capacity to accommodate continued growth is so important.  Failing to do so will force more and more users off the blockchain and onto inherently riskier and more centralized ""off-chain"" solutions.  

>So I would take it to understand, that you would or do not host your own wallet or node. So you're probably going to want someone to do that for you...You know...A trusted 3rd party. 

No. The average user has absolutely ZERO need to run a so-called ""full node.""   An SPV client can allow you to verify that the transactions that you care about have been included in a block with valid PoW and grow increasingly confident that this block has been accepted by the network as a whole as you watch it get buried ever deeper under more blocks with valid PoW while remaining the longest chain. SPV doesn't imply *less* security / confidence in the transactions you care about; it simply takes *a bit more time* to achieve a given level of confidence in a particular transaction of interest. (And that difference is extremely tiny, if not essentially theoretical, given how incredibly unlikely it is that you'll encounter an invalid block with valid PoW.)

The only assumption you make when you rely on SPV security is that the mining majority won't accept ""invalid"" blocks.  But Bitcoin's security model has *always* been explicitly premised on the assumption that the mining majority would be incentivized to be ""honest"" and protect the integrity of the network. Moreover, a malicious hash rate majority doesn't *need* to produce ""invalid"" blocks to defraud users or otherwise completely undermine the network's integrity.";3;0;False;Capt_Roger_Murdock;dpttdov;Fixed - Bitcoin Cash moving money far better.

">LTC moves coins better that bch and BTC . For some reason it's not popular as BTC. Why would bch take over?

I don't see how LTC moves coins any better than BCH. And the answer to your question is the network effect which is (almost) everything when it comes to money. Because Bitcoin Cash preserved the Bitcoin ledger as of the forking point, it has a much wider and healthier distribution than Litecoin. Indeed, the naive view (which I've seen some people advocate) is that Bitcoin Cash has the exact same network effect as BTC. That's obviously overstating things because the network effect isn't solely about coin distribution.  Bitcoin Cash was created as a minority hash rate spinoff that forfeited the standalone ""Bitcoin"" brand and made wallet-breaking changes to its transaction format and difficulty adjustment algorithm.  It has less exchange and ecosystem support, lower name recognition, and a market cap that's still substantially smaller than BTC's, all of which give BTC a strong advantage. The one significant advantage Bitcoin Cash has over BTC is that the former is not currently hobbling itself with an absurdly-inadequate capacity limit.  BCH's network effect advantage over alt-coins like Litecoin, however, is significant (and clearly reflected by the market's current relative valuation of those two coins).  If the Bitcoin main chain does commit suicide through continued mismanagement of scaling, it's much more likely that the market will converge on a ledger-preserving Bitcoin spinoff like BCH as opposed to converging on a true ""alt-coin"" like LTC.";6;0;False;Capt_Roger_Murdock;dptsnt3;Fixed - Bitcoin Cash moving money far better.

Even if we ignore the trading pairs, what about the strong linkage between fiat and BTC? This is going to be important to keep investors there.

What about all the merchants that accept BTC?

So basically, BCH has to find a way to raise this infrastructure through growth of user-base or have a plan for the BTC ticker.

"That's true.

I view it this way: there's 3 groups of miners.

  * hashrate that always mines BTC (probably around 40%)
  * hashrate that always mines BCH (probably around 10%)
  * hashrate that always mines the most profitable coin (probably around 50%) 

That means when price is between 0.1 and 0.6 BTC/BCH, the hashrate will allocate according to this price (between 10% and 60% on BCH). Outside that range, miners mine ""at a loss"" for idealistic reasons.

(I say hashrate to model miners that allocate resources based on price or similar schemes)

Also: I worded my assumption not very well. What I meant to say was that the difficulty adjusting upwards quickly will stop a massive influx of ""too many"" miners (turbo blocks).

That's not *entirely* correct. I think you're missing an important mechanism: miners want to enforce rules in such a way that it helps market price (they are profit-driven). So they *do* look at what ""the people"" want. Now, wether they fall for propaganda and make-belief about public opinion is another matter, but they certainly *do* take ""the market"" into consideration when making decisions about where to put their hashrate.

This doesn't make it ""a democracy"", but it certainly puts some power into the hands of the people, who can definitely ""vote with their wallets"" and influence where hashrate goes.

This can be seen very clearly now (with the new DAA): the price almost ""dictates"" which chain hashrate chooses (within limits), because a lot of miners (driven purely by profit-motive) just switch to the most profitable chain.

"> But I thought hard forks were simple and easy and there are no problems doing them on abbreviated time schedules?

If all the miners agree and the code is tested well enough, that's true. If you have shitty code and differing opinions on the hardforking change suggested, you'll most likely fork the chain. I don't personally think either of those are problematic, though.

> Bitcoin Cash doesn't even have many nodes and clients installed around the world..

Cash has roughly 1800 nodes. Core has 7800. So that's 25%. I think that's a good amount of nodes given that the value of the chain is less than 25% of that of the core chain currently.

Roughly the same goes for hasrate: about 20% currently.

"You've got a brand new product called iPhone. People are loving it so much that they fill up its 1MB of RAM memory with all the app they are using and it makes the device so slow that's it's barely usable.

Solution 1: update the firmware to make it run your app in a remote server in the cloud and you just visualize them in a browser. It works and it's still the original hardware of the iPhone but app are still slow to run when internet connection is slow and doesn't work offline.

Solution 2: sell the exact same version of iPhone but with 8MB of RAM that allow much more app to run making the device as fast as new again.

I don't think you understand. Full nodes that do not mine are just wasting the time of full nodes that do mine. They're spending resources listening to your node waiting for a block that will never come. It extends the distance between mining nodes for no reason. Mining nodes are very interconnected. The distance between two mining nodes is normally just one or two nodes. If it has to go through a bunch of other useless full nodes, you're just slowing down the network ;7;3;False;xModulus;dps870v;I can currently run a BCH node on my Raspberry Pi.

"You just set the memory pool expiry, either by a flag or a config.

You can set it to an hour, 24 hours, or forever.

In most implementations you can also configure a maximum memory pool size, in which case transactions will automatically be dropped once your allocated memory is full - typically on a “first in, first out” basis, but this can again vary by implementation.

Your node will still receive and forward new transactions and validate/propagate new blocks, and as long as it does this there’s not usually any need for non-mining nodes to keep transactions once they’ve been forwarded to your peer nodes, because you know at that stage the transaction will be forwarded on to the mining nodes. It’s good practice to keep as many as you can for at least a reasonable period, though.

All of those affect memory (RAM), but if you want to reduce hard drive usage that’s a little different. To affect storage space usage, you can “prune” the blockchain, and only keep recent transactions. Typically you would do this if your node only needs to ensure the recent blockchain is valid to validate new transactions, eg you don’t need to see the blockchain from 2011 in order to accept a $2 coffee payment in 2017. You can limit this by size or by a time period (specified in either blocks or days/weeks/months/year’s). And as above, specifics will depend on your node implementation (eg which software you’re running)";2;1;False;audigex;dps7k9o;I can currently run a BCH node on my Raspberry Pi.

"No.  That's not how it works.
