"**UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD YOU GIVE US YOUR PRIVATE KEYS**

&nbsp;

Hey guys, I've just launched a tech version of a ""Dead man's switch"" that I think could be useful to the crypto community with a no information free-trial.

My service will let you create messages (with attachments) that will be delivered to your contacts in the event you fail to tell us you're still alive.

&nbsp;

Example messages for protecting your crypto could include:

>1) ""Hey (spouse), I'm dead, the PIN to my hardware wallet in my desk is 387238""

>2) ""Hey Mom, I'm dead, the password to the encrypted Bitcoin Cash wallet on my computer is hunter2""

>3) We offer the ability to cURL your own server (www or .onion) so you can trigger your own thing without us knowing what it is.

Of course this service doesn't have to be used for crypto, you can send any messages you want. We've made this service as trustless as possible.

&nbsp;

We accept Bitcoin Cash (and Monero, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin) natively (running our own nodes) meaning you can be fully anonymous and never have to deal with things like Bitpay payment protocol during checkout. We have a very strict privacy policy you can read in plain english here: [https://absentplan.com/pages/privacy](https://absentplan.com/pages/privacy)

&nbsp;

Use promo code **reddit6** for a 6 month free trial and please provide feedback!

&nbsp;

#Brief list of Features:

- Client side encryption for messages or use your own. (PGP + AES).
- In house cryptocurrency payment processing so you can be anonymous if your situation needs.
- SMS and Email delivery of messages.
- SMS and Email delivery of reminders to check in and tell us you're alive.
- We can monitor your Facebook and Twitter for signs of life if permitted.
- cURL your own server (www or onion) if there are no signs of life (eg: dismount encrypted devices you don't want anyone to see).
- Create contact groups (eg: Family group, Friends group, Work group).
- Strict privacy policies.
- Password re-use prevention for registration.
- Two factor authentication.
- Lock your account and prevent it from being recovered by ""sim swappers"".
- Prevent anyone from viewing your messages even if they gain access to your account (Message lock feature).
- Disposable emails permitted.
- TOR and VPNs permitted.
- Attach files to messages. Encrypt them yourself if you don't trust us.

"Restaurants tend to have high margins and customers come and go based on what is fashionable or cool, so it makes sense.

What about BitPay? They probably operate in the UK? Otherwise, I'm not sure.

Or, you could ask them to use the [Bitcoin Cash Register app](https://www.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-cash-register/) and then manually sell via [local.bitcoin.com](https://local.bitcoin.com). You can pitch this as more of a learning opportunity that you will lend them a hand with.

Here are some steps:

1. visit during a non-rush time, probably between meal times.
2. Only speak with the owner. Don't waste time with employees unless perhaps you find there is an administrator instead of an owner present.
3. Tell them you are with Bitcoin Cash and you'd like to help them get new customers who pay with Bitcoin Cash. Give a 20-second spiel about Bitcoin Cash. It's digital money, the next evolution of money, people are using it (use present tense) to buy things, to send money across borders and it is becoming quite popular. You, Mr merchant, can be among the first pioneers to start learning about and using it in your area.
4. This whole time you have your phone in your hand with the wallet you want them to install open and you show it a little, but you are pushing them hard to get their phone and start installing the wallet. The [Bitcoin.com](https://Bitcoin.com) wallet is nice. ""The wallet is free, no obligation, none of this costs anything.""
5. If they are reaching for their phone or offering a substitute like a tablet or computer, you are good. If they are resisting, you need to protect your posture and be moving towards the door. Don't waste time on merchants who are not taking the actions you suggest. They will only see you as desperate and your value in their eyes will only cascade downwards.

"I see a lot of these fancy numbers and articles popping up, yet they ignore basics of blockchain analysis. You don't bruteforce a CashFusion transaction, you start analyzing what happened prior to CashFusion.

Example? The linked Cashfusion transaction got 118 inputs, in this tx [https://explorer.bitcoin.com/bch/tx/1958120f4061fcc8a8364a5af0328524eb29996dc13a8aeba84118693fff84ab](https://explorer.bitcoin.com/bch/tx/1958120f4061fcc8a8364a5af0328524eb29996dc13a8aeba84118693fff84ab) you can see at least two of them are linked. This already excludes tons of possible results, and I just clicked through three tx to find such a link.

Don't get me wrong, CashFusion is nice, but stop advertising unrealistic high numbers completely ignoring the still public part of the blockchain. This is where they may link your tx.

"I do agree that analysis outside of a transaction can reveal a lot. I do agree that you need to be careful afterwards. 

However the numbers are still astronomical. Even if you figure out that two inputs are linked - you still have to analyze about 2^127 instead of about 2^128 combinations. That's two times less, still nowhere reasonable to analyze. When you're closer to something like 20 or 30 total inputs and outputs (so you need to link about *a hundred inputs and outputs* somehow) - you might finish in reasonable time, but you'll still end up with huge number of plausible combinations (like billions).

Let's be honest about Kim Dot Com.  These ""knowledge bombs"" were rehearsed.  He paid people to write them for him.  He probably paid Tone to debate with him.   The guy pays people to shape his image for him.   Time and time again.   He's also been involved with countless scams and is quick to throw anyone around him under the bus if he thinks he can make a quick buck.

I know Kim from long before his involvement in crypto.  From back when he was running ~~megavideo~~ MegaUpload and cooperating with American authorities so that people who shared files would be thrown in jail.   Though the authorities didn't care that he was essential to them building cases against multiple file sharers and they came for him afterwards.  Just because he suffered the law for file sharing as well, doesn't change that he worked to have dozens of people imprisoned for file sharing before that.  All he got was house arrest in his mansion.  Whoopity doo.

"Gross oversimplification by Kim Dotcom.  The value of money is based on:

&#x200B;

1. Liquidity   (Writing as one point, but there are infinite different types of liquidity depending on what you want to do with your money)
2. Stability
3. Scarcity
4. Privacy
5. Age (How long it's been a store of value)
6. Legality
7. Security
8. Risk
9. Reward
10. Ease of Use

All of which different humans base different priority weights on based on their specific goals, beliefs, values, and needs.

In addition, between many of these factors inevitable trade-offs that occur.  These trade-offs make it objectively impossible to have a currency that is maxed out in all ten points.

Because of this, just as there is not a single social network now, there will not be a single currency in the future.  There will be several dominant currencies based on the most dominant needs and then smaller ones based on more niche needs.

In projecting the future value of a currency relative to it's current value many people make the mistake of asking the question, 'what will most users want in the future, that they haven't figured out they want right now?'.  This question is actually irrelevant in determining the relative future price of an asset class.  The correct question is 'what will most most money want, that it hasn't figured out it wants right now?'.  This is because poor people don't move the price of an asset nearly as much as rich people, unlike social network apps.

The next relevant question to ask, is what do most rich people want to do with MOST of their money?  I would wager that it's keep the money from deflating (store of value).  This is because people who are very rich tend to take risks, but do so in a way that minimizes their downsides.  The VAST majority of money can not take a long enough sequence of risks in order to get very rich without minimizing downsides, this is why I believe this strategy will be embedded into most of the world's money and it is somewhat predictable because of that.";-9;1;False;KeymasterLvl5000;fenjhtc;Kim Dotcom dropping knowledge bombs on BTC maxis;eq1nph;https://streamable.com/9sybc

There is no way this accounts for a factor 100x difference.

And no, the fundraiser revenues don't count, because these funds were paid by the general public, not by Bitcoin.com.

> Saying that the fault is on Roger for his donation amounts is asinine

Roger misrepresents other people's donations as his own and misrepresents in-kind donations as monetary donations. While I do not believe Roger does these misrepresentations with malicious intent, there is every reason to criticise him for making such inaccurate statements.

> Harping on the issue is questionable.

Thanks to this overview, we now understand what Roger was actually trying to say, so we all understand him other better moving forward. Personally, I am posting criticism in this topic so that Roger himself also understands why others consider his statement inaccurate, so that he can avoid making inaccurate statements in the future. Consider this an unsolicited in-kind donation to Roger (which is not the same as funding Roger, nor paying Roger $30).

From a neutral standpoint, Amaury was correct to say he didn't receive the $500k.

This impression leads to the thinking that ABC is ungrateful, having taken $500k and not doing any work, which we now know today that it is not true.

Pointing mistakes or problems is nothing bad and in fact I always valued Bch community for ability to face issues in fairly opened and transparent way.

That's also the reason I believe this community survived constant trolls and (as you nicely put it) useful idiots attacks.

I've said this before many times, Blockstream proposed and influenced technology is just tech to stall and buy time for Blockstream's products. They give just enough scaling ie SegWit which trojan horsing in the ability to build sidechains like Liquid which couldn't exist without SegWit. Then they give us Lightning to say that's how p2p functionality returns on Bitcoin and then say Lightning isn't Bitcoin's scaling solution years later down the line.

Don't believe me? Lightning is forever 18 months away with no solution in sigh for the weighted routing problem and the dozens of problems created by lightning. Instead every few months you get to hear a new set of buzzwords of patches that solve 1 problem on Lightning and create 3 more. 

This month's Lightning's new buzzwords are:

> Payment Mechanism and current routing

> Atomic Multipath Payments

> Beacon routing with Flare

> SpeedMurmurs

> Trampoline

> Ant routing

> Rebalancing channels

Here are all of the patches and future promised patches just for Lightning to work as well as Bitcoin so far: 

#Channel Factories, Submarine Swaps, Eltoo, Neutrino, Rendezvous Routing, Spontaneous Payments AKA Sphinx Send, Splicing, Turbo Chanels, Watchtowers,  Dual Funded Channels, Atomic Multipath Payments, Beacon routing with Flare, Speed Murmurs, Trampoline, Ant routing, Rebalancing channel, Lightning Rod.

We need a Bingo Card for all these patches.

I swear once a week Blockstream associates sit down with a 30 pack and just come up with new buzzwords just to keep the hype alive while they work on their product Liquid. I think they took a page from South Park: https://southpark.cc.com/clips/ivocf2/dense-boner-forest

"Of course.. When BTC was hitting its performance limits and the community was fracturing over segwit - half of them decided the idea to continue Bitcoin with a block size increase to scale with demand to evade fee bloat - the project fork was going to have to involve sacrificing the brand recognition that came with the BTC symbol, global decentralized hash power to properly secure its protocol...

That was always the expected limitation of BCH that the world would have to deal with once forking away

In a cryptocurrency, that means giving up basically everything - all was sacrificed to prominently display how BTC's current development road map involves abandoning its original mission of banking the unbanked... maintaining low fees is the top most priority for growth in niche sectors specially suited for crypto. Protecting utility in order to continue to service those in need with a crypto tailored for problem countries experiencing upheaval over the financial mis-dealings of their national banks and gov is the slack dropped by BTC that people are trying to pick up with BCH... That's the expected result of BTC development refusing to scale on chain with demand, allowing fees to be unreliable, experiencing sporadic rapid bloat

The only people who support BCH probably have to first decide that those fundamentals are worth giving up everything else for, even the price, or at least decide it's worth hedging their bets with, or even just to make a statement that the original mission had value and investing in making the world a better place is always worth it";10;0;False;vitriolic_amalgamati;fen04c7;‚Ä™Adam Back (Blockstream CEO) Describes Why Liquid is Bad‚Ä¨... ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è;eq02pm;https://i.redd.it/wzscsji57cb41.jpg

"Right. Back understands that different solutions will fit different use cases.

It's my opinion that most retail payments, for example, will be scaled through centralized solutions like visa for bitcoin or amazon processing it's own bitcoin payments.

This sub still thinks the best solution for paying for your coffee is broadcasting that transaction around the globe to tens of thousands of computers and using an absurd amount of hashrate and electricity to confirm it. It's absurd.

Why keep block size small?

"Each generation something does change.

- With early TV we had a lot of commercials and you watched shows as their aired.

- Next generation of TV had TIVO to allow watching episodes at one's own demand

- Streaming services are a simplification of that previous step and depending on which streaming services you have you may not have any commercials like Netflix comared to HULU.

It seems the biggest obstacle is the distribution of content across various services and packaging content into one service rather than letting users cherrypick. I think this might be the next focus in the next tier of tv services in this decade.

The other interesting thing to come up this decade is KODI box, which allows users to illegally stream sports without having to sucsribe to any bundle or packages and surprisingly it has a great deal of adoption even among the most tech illiterate people. I'm speaking from experience as many of my friends who can barely use a Macbook are able to use a KodiBox and do so regularly. Now the fire has been lit under these TV services asses so they will be forced to adapt.

"FWIW - He was initially going to run his entire platform on Bitcoin Cash.  

I was present online in the TG channel where the BTC maximalists whom he met regularly with to plan his upcoming ICO, were expressing disgust and outrage at his decision.  

They vowed they would do everything in their power to make sure he changed his tune.  They put a concerted effort into killing it.

When I asked for donations to continue operations we got about 10 dash, worth maybe USD$600. I couldn't even begin to cover the liabilities I had assumed for Dash with that.

When I asked for guidance, I was only asked to wait.

No one stepped up to champion our cause. You claim you were our big defender, but I have no recollection of ""Bitcoinawesome"". Where precisely did you publish your statement of support for us? Where are your comments on our prop at DashCentral?

Most of you guys are spectators. You are not doers. You watch, do nothing and then, not matter what, savagely and unfairly criticize. All for your own entertainment.

I correctly predicted that Dash has lost interest in Latam. The small and few remaining Latam-associated projects have had a very difficult time trying to remain funded.

Dash has abandoned the digital cash vision, and it has done so without a formal governance vote and without you guys falling out of lockstep with DCG.

The votes are clear, Dash wishes to spend its monthly budget on hodling funds in the DIF and on paying salaries for do-nothings at Dash Core Group.

To add insult to injury, I was then hounded by your Dash Force News goons who said I was fired because I produced no value for Dash. Lies, but nobody corrected them because Dash is a groupthink collective.

If you want to parrot the line about me ""working against other teams"", how about you finally present some evidence?

That narrative came out of the scammers at Dash Merchant Venezuela who cut their own throats with multiple and ongoing brazen acts of fraud, and like all fraudsters decided to throw the blame on someone else rather than take responsibility for their own misdeeds.

I don't remember writing a manifesto for Dash, but I did create a vision. Dash Core Group has no coherent vision. DACH wants 15 dash to create one. I gave you one for free. But somewhoe I am the bad guy.

Of course I want funding. I am building value here. I can't do it with my fingernails alone. If someone recognizes the value I see, and if they want to be a part of it, then they we are free to work out a voluntary arrangement.

Dash decided you didn't want my value. I had to accept it and so do you.";-1;0;False;georgedonnelly;fend1gx;Merchant Adoption is Pointless without Regular & Growing Inflows;epr4pa;https://read.cash/@georgedonnelly/merchant-adoption-is-pointless-without-regular-growing-inflows-89c3d89b
"Some advance notice and some appreciation, a little more than a couple bucks in donations, some guidance from Dash insiders, all of this would have been helpful yes. But we got none of it.

They are collecting DAO-generated block rewards in an investment fund based in the Cayman Islands under the control a few insiders. Ostensibly, the plan is they will trade the crypto market so well that they will generate income. This they might use to buy back and burn Dash in order to reduce the total Dash supply.

Simultaneously, they have created a sidechain on which they hope to compete to host dapps.

"You'll always be able to use on chain transactions with BTC too though.  It just wont be worth it to use one if it's for something inexpensive like micropayments or a cup of coffee.   If transaction fees get more expensive because of people competing for block space, that just means BTC is valuable and the block space is in demand.  It isn't a deficiency it's a feature.  Ultimately in 100 years fees need to support the entire mining incentive.  That's not going to happen with $0.01 fees.   

BTC will always have the most security if it has the most value.   It's a self reinforcing feed back loop.

While many people don't care about privacy, most should.

One of the ways you stay private is by not linking addresses. E.g. if I combined change from multiple vendors, then when I sent those combined coins, I leave a footprint that links all previous transactions to me. 

If you are serious about privacy, you should avoid combining coins or at least be conscious of the ramifications if you do. So do this tutorial for each change address.

This applies similarly to relying on a 0-conf trust model for most of the retail transactions in BCH: no Proof-of-Work, merchants have to trust their counterparties and miners that they won't defraud them after the delivery.

So you coming against Blockstream for trying something that also introduces trust in a way (in a federation of nodes) but ON A SIDECHAIN, when you want your trust model to become a standard for transactions that supposedly will be ON CHAIN at some point is quite hypocritical.

I think you need to take few steps back if you want to start judging who will be remembered as not respecting what Satoshi has created, straight from the whitepaper's conclusion:

> We have proposed a system for electronic transactions without relying on trust.

The system in question is Bitcoin and Liquid is a sidechain that is NOT part of Bitcoin. It just rests on confirmations accrued on Bitcoin for their proof of *reserves*.

You clearly are, you've just outlined it.

>  but I don‚Äôt really care for what you think when the math and more importantly, empirical evidence, says otherwise.

They say that double-spends can and do happen under this type of system. Other system like LN where PoW confirmations are accrued in advance do not have this problem and the delivery can actually be done trustlessly after the off-chain transaction (which is instantaneous).

It's not a problem of definition, you just refuse to accept the inherent flaws of not caring about Proof-of-Work because you desperately need instantaneous transactions to work for BCH to stay relevant.

You should know they cannot happen instantaneously on-chain though, your network sees a new block on average every 10 minutes, not every few seconds... but you keep trying to peg square shapes into a round hole.

And for this you've decide that some users **have** to take those risks if they want to do this kind of transactions... Taking risks implies trust/hope which is in direct contradiction with the quote of the whitepaper's conclusion I've provided.

> you are asking me to trust Blockstream and their party of shills and complicit exchanges or watch towers or custodial wallets or LN hubs or whatever the fuck off-chain project they‚Äôve conceived and I‚Äôm saying ‚Äúfuck that‚Äù, and I‚Äôm not trusting them with shit.

I'm not asking you to trust anyone. I'm telling you you shouldn't trust 0-conf transactions and if you have to believe that a transaction exists in any system related to Bitcoin or in Bitcoin itself it better have PoW behind it, on-chain... You're a fool if you're happy with just believing it *will* eventually be on-chain.

On LN transaction have a codified contract on-chain, with enough confirmations to consider it immutable. This is what ensure that the underlying transactions off-chain are trustless. Breach of the contract has consequences. 0-conf on the other hand provides NO guarantee at all.

Liquid is another story and I won't defend them. I don't really like their trust model, but I understand how some institutions and users who operate in more defined legal structures/jurisdictions can have legal obligations and might want to use such a system knowing its limitations. The difference is it happens on the side of Bitcoin, on a sidechain. Bitcoin is a permissionless system and I can't do anything ""against"" it even if I don't like it. Except not using it and outlining that it is way less trustless than Bitcoin.

With the proposition of BCH though, 0-conf would become the de facto standard for most retail commerce which require instant deliveries, then I won't have the choice of not using it if it gets adopted. As a merchant I will have to give this trust to my customers and miner or my competitors will just destroy me. This is forcing everyone who need this kind the transactions into a trust based system.

> On-chain or fuck off.

You just schizophrenically don't have this opinion when it comes to unconfirmed transactions, they are not ""on-chain"" but you have no issue trusting them... so actually by your standard you should proceed with the second option.

> That‚Äôs trustless buddy.
 
It's not and you know it, you just seem to be in it to sell some good ol' 0-conf snake oil in the name of adoption... who cares about ""without trust"" after all, it's not like it's a fundamental value of Bitcoin, it's all about adoption üôÑ";1;0;False;diradder;feoer7e;"Blockstream is attempting to move BTC from Proof of Work (PoW) to a Federation of centralized companies; guess who holds the master keys just in case the Federations cease?

"I believe the difference between Liquid and LTC is that Liquid's sole purpose is to do the atomic lock, it is essentially a sidechain. Calling it LBTC just denotes where the tokens currently are - on the Liquid sidechain.

Does Liquid do anything other than let you move around LBTC?

> if I atomic lock Bitcoin and LTC does that make LTC Layer 2?

If you were to do this and then trade that token around on exchanges, they would need to be labeled correctly to denote they are on LTC so you know what you are buying and what you need to do in order to get real BTC.

I guess the question is why would you want to do that atomic lock, either you want to do something that BTC can't currently do (like storing BTC in an Ethereum smart contract), you want to do what BTC can currently do but cheaper or just for the LULZ to throw up a POC on github.

For the first, I would say that is Layer 2 for sure.

For the second you are still doing something the base chain can't do - move coins around economically, but I would then ask why LTC and not a sidechain that periodically writes proofs to BTC for finalization every few blocks or a proof of authority network or even a database for the ultimate throughput. It comes down to finality and your level of risk. Liquid is trying to get finality and trust to a level exchanges are comfortable enough with so they can trade coins around to each other cheaply without requiring the level of finality BTC provides with its massive hash rate and then I guess they plan to monetize their solution.

Since we are arguing semantics on what constitutes Layer 2, I would still call that Layer 2 because you are trying to do something the base layer cannot do - move coins around economically.";1;1;False;Tjaard09;fen7n46;/r/Bitcoin allows discussion of Blockstream's alt;epjnq8;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/epjnq8/rbitcoin_allows_discussion_of_blockstreams_alt/

Thanks for your input.

This is how I understood it when explained by Amaury Sechet and by re-reading Bitcoin Whitepaper.

how is this even possible?

if TX1 belongs to a chain of unconfirmed txs it will admitted to the mempool only if all its ancestors are already admitted in the mempool, otherwise it will be staged in the orphanpool.

if the above is true there's no way that a node see a 26th tx as 24th and whereas another sees it as 27th. the first two nodes would stage the tx in the orphanpool until all ancestors will came in and then will move it to the mempool and then all nodes will see the tx as 27th.

Am I missing something obvious here?

I've last contributed to Core over 5 years ago and forked their codebase 4 years ago. I've been trying to keep track of what they do and I backport fixes every now and then.

From this experience I feel that Core is going in the wrong direction. Big issues in the codebase are typically made worse over time, making it harder to scale and over time making it harder to remove the bad parts.

So, my own personal conclusion is that its not needed to port all code from Core. In fact, its detrimental to making a world-class scaling client.

> Core does not have efficiency in mind, because their blocks are only 1MB. So porting from Core has high risk of becoming an optimization problem sooner or later.

So the only thing that such a benchmark would prove is what 100% of the devs have been telling you, that CPFP (as implemented in ABC) is expensive on longer chains.

Right, it's substantial! ;)

That would mean the same output would have to be bumped around, on average, more than 25x in 10 minutes.  I honestly don't know what kind of tipping Roger does at his meetups, but it's nothing like what I've seen.

SatoshiDice is a fairly unique use case, and they make a compelling argument about how it would help their particular service.  However, chaining longer and longer unconfirmed transactions together is not without cost and I don't see anyone other than SatoshiDice and Roger (who I assume probably has a financial interest in SatoshiDice) pushing for increasing the limit.  I don't see anyone but them caring to raise it at all.
