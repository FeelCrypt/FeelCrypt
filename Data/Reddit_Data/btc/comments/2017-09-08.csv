"That's stupid tin-foil hat talk. Yes governments can ban cryptocurrency. Will their bans be perfect? No, like every law, there will be some people in violation of it.


But can governments effectively cripple the ability to transfer large amounts of fiat into and out of crypto easily? Definitely. Can they effectively cripple the widespread acceptance of cryptocurrency by well established businesses and institutions, thereby limiting the ability of crypto to ever be used as a currency? Sure. Is a currency you can't readily obtain and can't ever expect to use for any ordinary purchase really appealing as a currency? Nope.

"I do not disagree with the argument that the market will eventually determine the future of all coins, but I wonder if the evolving framework of cryptocurrency in general will not change to accept both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash for different purposes. It seems to me that Bitcoin is evolving into a store of value or a settlement layer and away from a medium of exchange, whereas Bitcoin Cash along with Litecoin and possibly other less recognizable currency coins are designed primarily to be mediums of exchange. 


Bitcoin has become so valuable (expensive) and speculative (based a great deal on its deflationary nature) that most people are unwilling to actually use it out of fear that they will lose future gains. Additionally, these same characteristics make it less acceptable to merchants because the valuation fluctuates so much that setting prices is problematic. In a way, Bitcoin Cash will eventually suffer from these issues regardless of transaction speed and cost because it will also be deflationary. That has yet to become an issue, but it certainly could. 


In the end, both might prove to be a store of value upon which other currencies, systems, and mediums of exchange are based in much the same way as gold was used. In this case, I predict the coins with massive amounts in existence (don't laugh, but things like Doge or Linda) might become the real mediums of exchange because their large numbers in circulation will hamper speculation and therefore fluctuation making them acceptable to both consumers and merchants. In the end, if the market is really to compete with fiat, will not be those of us who are sharing on this sub, but the mothers and fathers and grandparents who are shopping for groceries who will not be interested in anything other than how to predict the price of bread from day to day.  


I am still encouraged by these events, however, because even if some of these coins become settlement layers or stores of value, they will still be more transparent and fair than fiat. Cryptocurrency, in any form, is still more real than the fake paper printed by reserve banks.";5;0;False;Saiyasat;dmqc1r4;Bitcoin Cash is Terrifying;https://medium.com/@jonaldfyookball/bitcoin-cash-is-terrifying-f1a8cc4d536

"That's the great part about the 8mb blocks. Cash mined its first full block during a massive spam transaction attack a few weeks ago. It took hardly any time at all to clear the transaction backlog and return to normal. That same attack on the Bitcoin network would have crippled it (though it would have cost way more to carry out thanks to high fees).

Transactions will remain cheap and fast even if market cap and usage levels for BCC were to match those for BTC tomorrow. Likely well beyond that point, too. Nobody at this point can argue the block size increase did not work as intended.

The only argument left is whether a hard fork block size increase is a viable long-term solution for scaling. If we're pushing for worldwide peer-to-peer electronic cash (i.e. White Paper), 8mb is not enough and we'll have to fork again. And again. Is that healthy? I'm still personally not convinced either way, but there are good arguments for either side.

"So as someone who got interested in cryptocurrency recently (and so far I mostly just have ETH), I didn't actually know that the *forked* version of Bitcoin was staying more true to the original vision of the coin. But based on that information and my (admittedly limited) knowledge of the crypto market, would it be reasonable to expect a ""reversal of fortunes,"" so to speak, between Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Cash? That is, could we expect Bitcoin Cash to see incredible gains and even catch up with/take over Bitcoin Core's position in the market? Bitcoin Core has gotten close to 5000 USD/coin recently. It was under 3k USD hardly a month ago, before the fork. It would seem that, perhaps, having all of the ""elite"" investors and financial institutions backing it is good for the health of the coin and probably makes it much less likely to rapidly or significantly lose value.

"How certain are you about the troll interpretation? Website hijack attempts and posting of manipulated fake repos sound scary to me as a BCH and electron cash user.

Even if it was trolls and not malicious attackers, your reaction seems immature. Critizising the way you handle yourself as a developer/maintainer (no https originally, unsigned binaries, website under fake name, having to ask whether you should take action against people creating fake githubs) or critizising the software you wrote does not in any way attack bitcoin cash as a whole. 

Your actions do however make it hard to trust your software, to be honest. Which is what I took from the posts you percieved to be troll attacks.

I recommend getting a code signing certificate from https://codesigncert.com/ if you are serious about security based development. Yes it costs money (around $60 a year), but you could ask for donations for that or see it as an investment into your portfolio as a security software developer.

Another recommendation is to never take such attacks lightly. Treat them as malicious attacks even if you suspect it could be a harmless troll.

"When I first started in Bitcoin I was primarily attracted by the technology, fast transactions, and low fees. As Bitcoin progressed (digressed?) all three of these items has either stagnated or moved backwards. Bitcoin has become less of a transaction mechanism for the masses and more of a play-toy for the elite few that would rather pay more than less and have slow instead of fast (basically cutting off their noses to spite their faces).

I have switched to Bitcoin Cash and will never wonder about my decision or look back over my shoulder at my decision to switch.

How is segwit/Ln TECHNOLOGY related to some DISCUSSION FORUM ""censorship""?

Listen to yourself!

Btw, this subreddit is also ""censored"" though I prefer term ""moderated"". I've been banned twice (open moglod? I bet you will NOT find anything about these bans from that thing. That's how much ""open modlog"" matters.) Additionally I'm currently restricted to 5 posts a hour. The mods here say it's not suppression and will not remove the restriction (although they've removed it for some others). Now talking about this ""censorship"": What do you think, is 5 posts a hour suppression or not? How about one per day or one per month?

"> Doesn't bigger blocks also make full nodes only affordable only by big players?

No.  The timeline where we fill up 8Mb blocks is a few years, unless adoption, and then value, skyrocket.  The cost of storing the entire blockchain now is dollars, maybe 10's of dollars.

By the time we get to VISA level of transactions, in 20-30 years, the cost to store the entire Blockchain, will be dollars.  By that time, the value of Bitcoin will be so high, that the cost of running a full node, on whatever counts for commodity hardware at that time, will be like a grain of sand in a sandbox.

Using Bitcoin as a settlement layer, is saying we will exclude most everyone so we do not risk excluding everyone.  It is not what Bitcoin is or what is supposed to do.
