"> (...) a mixture of attack and altruism

Or just by accident.

I suppose that if a node A restarts, the mempool is cleared, the server will receive transactions from its peers, and it will rebroadcast those transactions like if they were fresh (transactions does not have any timestamp attached to them) and keep them for two weeks.

So the transaction stays behind in node A even if they are evicted by B, C and D.  Then B restarts, and ask its peers for all transactions in the mempool - and will get the outdated transaction once more from A.

"> But let's put that aside... Ripple is going to accomplish what exactly? 30-60% cost savings for banks vs using SWIFT and save banking customers days in international wires? Woopee... Pretty much every crypto can do that. Fuck, DOGE can do that, with even lower fees and it's a freggin meme coin. Only difference is Doge is not going to get integrated into core banking software platforms.

You answered your own question. ""only difference is doge is not going to get integrated into core banking software platforms"" ...Thats a big difference, its the whole point. Ripple has gained the trust of over 100 banks/FI's with their incredible technology and incredible team backing them. In order to facilitate cross border settlements there needs to be a bridge currency implemented within all of the participating banks software that supports all other currencies. This is what ripple has been doing for the past few years, gaining trust and partnerships. In order for another coin to replace them they would have to pitch and sell their software to all of these banks and replace what ripple has already done to perfection... not happnen bruh.

"**Peter Kropotkin**

Pyotr Alexeevich Kropotkin (; Russian: Пётр Алексе́евич Кропо́ткин; December 9, 1842 – February 8, 1921) was a Russian activist, scientist, and philosopher, who advocated anarchism.

Born into an aristocratic land-owning family, he attended a military school and later served as an officer in Siberia, where he participated in several geological expeditions. He was imprisoned for his activism in 1874 and managed to escape two years later. He spent the next 41 years in exile in Switzerland, France (where he was imprisoned for almost 4 years) and in England.

I am all for BCH (own almost 100), new tech, decentralization, anonymity and privacy. But I dont see how Ripple eliminating waste in the financial/banking industry is a bad thing. Old people wont be able to really use cryptos. I know because I have been spent the past 3 months trying to get my grandpa set up and trading but to no avail... and he WANTS to learn. He even admits that the vast majority of people his age wont be able to crypto without messing something up (losing coins, gets hacked, etc).

Minimum wage laws are a misguided attempt to increase income of the poor. Very misguided. It's price-fixing and price-fixing doesn't work, it just lowers the supply (of jobs in this case).

Hey, you'll never know what it's like to get your network attacked over at bcash because you are owned. It is the leaderless DECENTRALIZED coin that is under attack. No need to attack the centralized bankster backed bcash, it is ALready under THEIR control.

"In fact, I don't regard the EU as ""unelected authorians"". The EU idea was to have an economic union, free movement across borders in hoping this will help ensuring a peaceful coexistence among its member countries. Europe's history is full of wars, and I formly believe mutual understanding of each others cultures and develop stable democracies is way to avoid future wars, and is a future I want.

I think I have plenty of opportunities to address issues (and there may be many) to my local (EU)politicians in my area, and I lived in multiple countires with free media, where I also can speak without fear of repression, and where state media is critical to the ruling government. (!)

EU is a collection of counties which adhere to a shared set of democratic values. No country was forced to join the EU. I sincerely believe e.g. Poland has profited well from EU investments into e.g. infrastructure. 
EU is also appreciating freedom of speech and protecting minorities, helping peaceful coexistence.

EU is not replacing and ruling states, but defining a common set of values (something which is being discussed heavily) which are economically supported in many ways.

Now, regarding your comment, see it from my point of view: why should I as an EU citizen and taxpayer continue support a country which suddenly decides to destroy fundamental principles of democracy (division of power), and where the state media suddenly synchronizes with the ruling party and silences any voice of oposition? This is not part of any EU contract, so I think EU has all right to apply measures here.
If you don't like it, then you may do another Brexit, noone can decide against the will of the people as long as you are in a free country.

Of course, from your point of view it may look like some ""Authority in Brussels"" is trying to ""rule"" your country. I think some people even benefit from spreading this false narrative. Maybe you should check this more thoroughly, in the end it may be based on some ideals people have voted for.

Oh, and old apparatchiks could be replaced by other means than installing an oligarcy, for sure. Especially if these are violating democratic fundaments, I am sure your local (EU-)politicians would like to hear about your thoughts.

And finally, know that I was very anti-EU for many years, but my many visits to Poland made me change my mind.

"Extreme poverty? Seriously? Do you even know what is poverty then?

What about dictatorship? There was a military coup. 5 million (!) syrian refugees came to Turkey during the last few years. The PKK terror organization and others did endless terror attacks in Istanbul and other cities. If the US would suffer from that much terror attacks you can be sure there would be much more than just the police on the street.  Without a strong leader this country would fall apart. 

I have been to Turkey around 6 times during the last few years. Didnt see poverty, but what I saw are extremely frightened people. But not because of their president, but terror attacks and terrorists.

[OECD](http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/countries/turkey/) seems to say otherwise - pretty much everything is below average.

> * Turkey ranks above the average in civic engagement. It ranks below average in income and wealth, health status, social connections, education and skills, jobs and earnings, subjective well-being, environmental quality, work-life balance, housing andpersonal security.  
> * the average household net-adjusted disposable income per capita is lower than the OECD average of USD 30 563 a year.  
> * 51% of people aged 15 to 64 in Turkey have a paid job, belowthe OECD employment average of 67%, and one of the lowest figures in the OECD.  
> * In Turkey, 39% of adults aged 25-64 have completed upper secondary education, much lower than the OECD average of 74% and one of the lowest rates among OECD countries.  
> * In general, Turks are less satisfied with their lives than the OECD average. When asked to rate their general satisfaction with life on a scale from 0 to 10, Turkish people gave it a 5.5 grade on average, much lower than the OECD average of 6.5.

"**Crimes against humanity**

Crimes against humanity are certain acts that are deliberately committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack or individual attack directed against any civilian or an identifiable part of a civilian population. The first prosecution for crimes against humanity took place at the Nuremberg trials. Crimes against humanity have since been prosecuted by other international courts – such as the International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and the International Criminal Court, as well as in domestic prosecutions. The law of crimes against humanity has primarily developed through the evolution of customary international law.

"I hated everything about that video. Especially his ""joke"" at the end. 

However, one cannot disagree with facts. If everything his said is true (which I cannot confirm because I'm not knowledgeable enough on the topics), that would be really, really sad. Like a dream being crushed by the things we wanted to overcome like corporate greed and the interests of banks.

If the LN were really such a danger, I don't think it'd ever be approved. Maybe there's something he's not seeing (or deliberately omitting) like some sort of autonomous decentralized node created through ICOs or some other thing. I'm not an engineer.

It seems shortsighted to think a company would be able singlehandedly outsmart several million people now that we have the internet.

Edit: corporationally/corporatevely crushed -> by the corporate things we hated

These things are all still theoretical and obviously will never be realistically applied exactly as these stupid ideologues think they will.

Instead of discussing how economically this could save the planet and third world people or how this could even be introduced to them, they'd rather just pat off each other's dicks by saying Bitcoin Cash is literally Bitcoin, or why /r/bitcoin sucks even though that's the only goddamn reason anyone is here.

There is no giant conspiracy. Most people still use banks. I transfer Bitcoin into my bank via coinbase on a regular basis.  I pay my taxes. If you think you can cheat the government you have a rude awakening coming

Both are useful. Let me hit you with a little reality: Banks are still useful. They are not all lizardpeople. Bitcoin will not replace banks, it will coexist beside it.

I tend to agree .. the most important thing now is we _use_ BCH day to day, and improve the tooling around it.     

The real revolution comes when it replaces cash and banking.    I had to go to a physical bank branch the other day, and queue up and wait, its so old fashioned and impractical just to move some cash around.  The time before that, after I'd waited 25 mins, the teller wanted to sell me insurance, arghhh!!

Its pretty liberating when you can send a tip across the world, easily .. I never used Bitcoin before the fork, even though I was a believer .. because the fees would always be too high for small sends.. I never wanted to risk anything or experiment.

I've tried a couple wallets with BCH .. some are a bit clunky, some ok, they will improve.  I can move funds around and have been trying smaller fees.. the last one was $10 sent to a relative, and the fee was around 1 cent USD.  

It feels a bit liberating - wont solve all the worlds problems, but I think it will have a new empowering / democratizing effect ... and I always think that more commerce within and between countries makes war less likely.

I'm from 2011 and I can assure you the OP is true and relevant. We're talking about a revolutionary new public good, ie sound money, that central banks have fought for years (gold) because the stakes of power and wealth are so enormous. You have to be an Austrian economic follower and /or previous gold bug to really understand. It also helps to have traded and or studied fiat markets in depth to appreciate the massive manipulation and corruption that exist there and what alot of sophisticated investors are trying to get away from (think of the bans on shorting financial stocks in 2008, bailouts, money printing, no one went to prison, TARP, etc). Blockstream is equivalent to the Fed controlling the money supply, ie, they're trying to control the blocksize supply and thus the price of using money, eerily similar to interest rates (except their strategy is one way crippling to advantage LN /SC's). ;8;0;False;H0dl;ds6f08g;Bitcoin Cash is not just fighting for bigger blocks.

"Sorry to disappoint, but I actually *do* believe that:

> Major change happens slowly. People thought the .com boom changed the rules; but the crash at the end of the last century proved that was not the case. Bitcoin proves that ""Know your customer"" laws are a human rights issue. The average person can possibly console themselves that they are not likely to run into the reporting limits (that are no longer actually hard limits).

> Bitcoin is also not ready for mass adoption. At an minimum, multi-party signatures have to be easy enough to use in a privacy-respecting way (meaning with a new address for every transaction). The network is still limited to about 7 transactions per second as well. If it goes ""big"" as-is: it will replace wire transfers, and not much else.

> It took the industrial revolution about 300-400 years to happen after the invention of the printing press made the dissemination of information cheap and efficient. The governments in power fought the change: inventing copyright law to slow the spread of information. The agricultural revolution probably took a similar amount of time, if not longer. The invention of networked computers will lead to the information revolution if we don't kill ourselves first. I don't expect it to complete in my life-time.  Sadly, many never learn the new technology. The old generations have to die off before truly revolutionary change is accepted.

> Bitcoin is a revolutionary experiment. It is the ""first secure networked application ever created in the history of computers."" (Out-of-context Bruce Schneier quote) Governments and banks will attack it through legal and technical means. It may only have a small niche over the next 50 years. If that happens, it will be OK: because it is just an experiment.

Honestly this is a great business strategy when you think about.

Yes, and it's a bad thing. For optimal security, mining should be more distributed and diverse rather than concentrated in a particular nation-state (especially one with a track record of sporadic hostility to blockchain). Core has a good point in that minimizing (within reason) block size and other constraints on running a full node will help with this. But Core has been a bit extreme, since going up from 1mb to something less than 10mb would still leave plenty of  headroom re: who can run full nodes. But, anyhow, block size is not the main determinant of why there is concentrated mining in China--ASICs, mining pools and path dependence have a lot more to do with that. We need ASIC-proof mining methods (including maybe PoS) if we want to ensure that more miners from more places will always be in the game. But that's just not in the cards for bitcoin. ;1;0;False;le_wraith;ds5h9wg;Purse.io gets it.;7nvllm;https://i.redd.it/i77qen5zmv701.png
