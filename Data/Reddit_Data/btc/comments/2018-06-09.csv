People in here can't see the forest for the trees but I guarantee for a lot of those who read this everything will start to make sense:-

>Well, quite obviously, Bitcoin isn't ""destroyed"". Someone asked me earlier what Bitcoin Cash is, I wrote the following, if you read this you'll understand exactly the intention of a video called ""Why blockstream destroyed Bitcoin"":-

>Bitcoin cash represents a minority of the original Bitcoin community who were determined to scale Bitcoin using big blocks but after years of trying did not gain enough support and so split from the Bitcoin chain.

>The people who actually created and designed the initial split is a very powerful company called Bitmain, hence my name. They are the main producers of ASIC (the computers that mine Bitcoin) in the world and have essentially a total monopoly on the production.

>This in effect makes them the owner of the entire Bitcoin network, i.e if they stop selling to everyone and just use them all for themselves they have total control over the network using their hash power.

>Those who are affiliated with them absolutely love this idea, obviously. The problem is Bitmain became so rich they were just able to buy up the other companies, so obviously, they started to.

>The rest of the community, which is the majority by a long margin right now have been fighting back against this attempt to centralize Bitcoin's control.

>This has spurred Bitmain to actually hide the extent of their hash power by creating new companies and giving them the hash power and then pretending they are independent. Which is not the case.

>This is the bare bones of the situation. HOWEVER, it gets more complicated, because while having bigger blocks helps large miners to gain more control (due to hardware limitations right now), having small blocks gives companies who want second layer systems an entry point and way for them to make money themselves that wouldn't have arisen for a long time otherwise.

>So essentially on both sides you have manipulations, Bitmain and his affiliates alongside other large miners who all want big blocks to give themselves control. Then on the other side Blockstream who wants second layer systems and require through-put limitations to make them viable in the first place.

>So on this basis you have to look at what is logically a better situation:-

>1.) A Chinese company headed by a single man cornering the entire cryptospace for himself and everything that entails for the reputation of a global Bitcoin.


>2.) An artificial cap on blocksize that reduces on chain throughput, changing the original structure of Bitcoin but maintaining all its original use cases/intentions while remaining totally decentralized and unstoppable.

>A dishonest large company has a lot to gain on both sides, but for the normal user decentralized is the most important thing so your money is not just ""disappeared"" one day.

oh but there is, the old 1MB limit is still in place even when since SegWit the calculations are actually done with block weight. Anyone who accidentally produces a block with a base size larger than 1MB would find themselves mining their own chain, split off from the rest of the network

> Fact of the matter is that everyblock can now handle more tx. Edit: and blocks are now larger than before segwit.

and if the actual block size was increased instead of SegWit's workaround, the blocks would contain *more* transactions for the same effective total size of block+signatures. Core, Blockstream and all their apologists like to pretend that they're all about efficiency, but SegWit is LESS EFFICIENT with respect to bandwidth/storage 

also, isn't one of the favorite BTC-maximalist talking points that bigger blocks increase centralization? Then what of SegWit's larger combined blocks/signatures, hmm?

Well, to be honest I haven’t gone into depth on the Lightning Network for reasons being; I find the combination of censoring of opposing ideas/concerns with LN, lack of development for L1, and for profit businesses contributing to L2 quite odd in regards to the original Bitcoin Protocol implementation from 09-14. 

Reading between the lines the companies involved have more economic incentive to extract profit from the Bitcoin Protocol via L2 implementations - in which I don’t believe that is what the original Protocol is about.

In all, I believe in a free world and that Blockstream is entitled to implement what they feel is the best protocol and over time the market will decide.

> Very well fucking said.

The assertion that Blockstream controls the BTC development is proven to be wrong. Check it out yourself:

 Bitcoin is just one example of something that uses a blockchain. Cryptocurrencies are just one example of decentralized technologies. And now that the Internet is big enough and diverse enough, I think we will see different flavors of decentralized technologies and blockchains. I think decentralized networks will be the next huge wave in technology. The blockchain allows our smart devices to speak to each other better and faster. Particullary such blockchains as Credits with fast tps as I know.  They claim about 1 mln TPS and approved 400 000 TPS. ;4;2;False;BleedingUnicorn;e0dbmfa;Why Blockstream Destroyed Bitcoin;https://youtu.be/0BZoKH-hX_o
"Another conspiracy filled, poorly researched video by this guy. I'll go ahead and break down the many lies/conspiracy theories brought up in this video and provide some facts/context in case anyone in this subreddit cares about the actual facts.

""Blockstream has almost complete control over the Bitcoin Core team"" - False. For a detailed breakdown of this, I recommend reading this EXCELLENT thread that shows just how few Blockstream employees actually commit anything to Bitcoin. It's a bit dated (November 2017) but the info is fantastic: https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7ctnog/reminder_many_of_the_bitcoin_core_developers_are/dpsn7pe/ (11 of the 300 BTC devs are blockstream employees, and of the top 10 committers over the past 2 years, only 1 is employed by blockstream. 

""Adam Back created the current Bitcoin scaling problem so Blockstream could profit from it"". Blockstream has way less power than this subreddit likes to believe. See above. Blockstream does for sure have plans to release Liquid, a sidechain that does secure, instant transactions via a sidechain with actual Bitcoins. Sounds like a cool idea. I will point out, there is nothing wrong with capitalism. If there is not economic incentive to build things for Bitcoin, Bitcoin will struggle to ever grow at the pace it would otherwise. It's like the OP - how about you create this video and refuse to take tips or get ad revenue? Of course not, that's absurd. You're creating content that people enjoy, make some money from it.

""Coins from sidechains can have better smart contracts, offer instant transactions, or anonymity features"" Actually, you're dead on here. Sounds fantastic.

""The difference between sidechains and the main chain is the fees on the sidechains go to the developers"". Maybe on Liquid, but not on LN. On LN, the fees (if they aren't zero) go to whoever is processing your transaction for you if you don't have a direct channel with the other person/entity (hubs). These hubs aren't the developers. It can be anyone in the world. I don't really know much about Liquid, so maybe you're right in terms of Liquid, but Liquid isn't trying to sell itself as a decentralized solution to the scaling problem. Liquid is about commerce and arbitrage opportunities (from what I understand) and is meant to be a for-profit centralized solution. Has nothing to do with the scaling problems/solutions.

""Blockstream profits on what Bitcoin can not do"" Catchy line but purely bullshit. First off, as outlined above, Blockstream has essentially no control over the Core team. If you want to believe in fairy tales, fine, go on ahead, but I'm sticking with facts here. There is no proof that Blockstream controls the Core team or really has any real influence over them whatsoever. And I will say again... Blockstream has no way of profiting from LN outside of just running a large hub or leveraging the LN to create other business opportunities. Again, capitalism is not a bad thing. Just because someone does something to make a profit doesn't make them evil.

""Bitcoin can't scale on-chain, has unreliable transaction times, high fees, and has no smart contract capabilities"". How can you trust anyone who lies 4 times in one sentence? Segwit was a blocksize increase, so it did scale on-chain. Bitcoin is as reliable as BCH. They have the EXACT same standard - pay the fee and you get in. Not only that, if you use Segwit, paying 1 sat/byte you are almost guaranteed to get a first block confirm. Same rate as BCH. High fees? Again, both Bitcoin and BCH require a 1 sat/byte minimum and both basically guarantee a first block confirm. Fees have been tiny on Bitcoin for several months now. Why do BCH insist on lying about Bitcoin having high fees? Lastly, Bitcoin does have smart contract capabilities. How do you think LN is possible? Mind-boggling.

""Sidechains are more accurately described as fee harvesting layers"" Yes, sidechains sole purpose is to collect fees. They have no other functionality, let alone provide users the ability to use transfer Bitcoins at a steep discount per transaction.

""Sidechains re-direct fees and decision-making from the miners to the developers"" WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? The main chain will always exist and is absolutely critical to everything sidechains do. Miners still get every fee on the main chain and the main chain will always be the most secure way to do Bitcoin transactions. And again, developers make jack-shit from LN. They can create products and other sidechains that are centralized and provide services for a cost that people can choose whether or not they want to pay to use, but it's not forced on anyone. Liquid is an example.

Lastly, in regards to the $80,000,000 that blockstream raised... Yes, people think building products on top of the Bitcoin protocol has the potential to make investors lots of money in the long run. Institutional money coming in and investing in building things on top of Bitcoin IS NOT A BAD THING. As an example, radio waves were discovered in the 1870s, but it wasn't until 1895 that the radio was first invented. Radio waves are the decentralized main component (Bitcoin) and the Radio is the 2nd layer solution/product that no one could have seen coming in the 1870s when radio waves were first discovered. Thank god people came along and found out a way to not only monetize radio waves, but also improve everyone's lives in the process.

Bottom line, this video is filled with lies and conspiracies just like the other videos. The problem is, it fits into every narrative and conspiracy theory this subreddit has pushed for years so people give this guy money and reddit gold because he's re-affirming every conspiracy they believe in.

It’s plain as day and denying it almost borders on retardation at this point. 

Seriously. 

And side note:  it’s common knowledge that the devs who make the final decision on what does and doesn’t get into the final release, are on BS payroll.  Or were until recently.

"No, what is bad for crypto adoption is Bitcoin Core Dev's throttling Bitcoin so it cannot perform the number of transactions that would make it the force of freedom that it could be in the world, and then hijacking those very same functions it throttled with equivalent products to run off-chain, from which they can profit. That is what is bad for crypro adooption. 

But, mealy-mouthed you, apologist for mediocrity, Squad car troll for Core or at best a member of the intentionally stupid - you can't see that can you? Or won't see that, will you? 

What IS incredibly bad for Bitcoin adoption and crypto in general is people like you who don't understand what the fight is about, or purposefully obfuscate and cast it as just a matter of arbitrary, irrational hate, and who respond like a bad parent saying, ""Stop this nonsense now, go play in separate rooms, each with your own toys or find new ones, there's lots of real enemies out there boys, let the best ones win!"", not recognizing that Bitcoin is the first and last of its species of which there can only be one (as are a number of other not merely copycat crypto currencies out there), and that while Bitcoin Cash is trying to preserve it, Bitcoin Core is pretending to kick its corpse and make replicas.

"BCH is basically a well-marketed, selfish, business proposition built around bitcoin. Because it is being played as a business, it has its efficacies. People who wanted bitcoin to stick to its ideals hate on it for diluting the bitcoin philosophy.

Roger Ver has used the control of bitcoin.com to his advantage with questionable tactics. The promise that BCH is the ""affordable"" bitcoin (due to the price difference) has captured many newbies as followers.
They keep reinventing the narrative while simultaneously using ""bitcoin"" name to prop themselves up. I would say Roger has played his cards well and that will ensure survival of BCH.

Leaving BTC ""completely"" for BCH would be a silly move. BTC is ""The bitcoin"" with the biggest network and most hashing power. It is the foundation of crypto and it'll be here when most others have been washed over. BCH with its 32 MB blocks will head towards bandwidth and storage issues (that are being supposedly solved by the technical conman-incharge CSW aka fake-satoshi). BCH can suffice for now but don't view it as a BTC alternative. There is no other bitcoin. If their was, Roger and Jihan would have let go their BTC bags. They won't cause they know there is no ""alternative"".";-4;2;False;mxj87;e0dlja7;Why Blockstream Destroyed Bitcoin;https://youtu.be/0BZoKH-hX_o

BCH is the alterative *bitcoin* to BTC, but there are also several viable currencies out there that have nothing to do with bitcoin.

"The fees LN nodes make from relaying transactions are so tiny that they don't even cover the electricity cost needed to run the node.
