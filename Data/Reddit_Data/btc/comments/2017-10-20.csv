"Lending doesn't require fractional reserve, no. But it does make it more efficient. If you had a world where all loans were backed by deposits, there would be far fewer loans. The multiplier varies by country but is generally between 10x and 100x of underlying deposits. When you look at the balance sheet it makes a lot more sense, it's all leverage (they're kinda borrowing against themselves to pay the loans). The inflation argument is a bit more nuanced than you make it out to be imo, because the central bank is the sole issuer of fed funds/esf they are the ones pulling the strings and that is magnified through the commercial banks.

You probably already know this but it's interesting to know that the money that banks call their asset isn't actually the same money that we give to them. Their assets are deposits at the fed in the form of 'fed funds' and what you see in your bank account is 'fake money' (fiat) that is backed by the central bank which issues it's own 'fake money' (exchange settlement/fed funds) to banks. The really mind-boggling thing imo isn't the commercial side but just how good the fed has gotten at controlling the money supply to hit their inflation and growth targets.";2;0;False;ooloops;dom7kz0;Since most people seem to have already forgot again what bitcoin was invented for, here is a copy of u/hodlgentlemen's post back then;77bx9m;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/77bx9m/since_most_people_seem_to_have_already_forgot/

A corollary from this: Bitcoin must be made as easy to transact with as possible, to prevent a similar fractional reserve takeover. Fiat defeated gold not because people wanted fiat more, but because gold was inconvenient, creating a demand for people to own them by proxy instead of directly, hence allowing fractional reserve. We must not allow that to happen, hence we must make bitcoin as easy to transact with as possible.;3;1;False;imaginary_username;dom13wi;Since most people seem to have already forgot again what bitcoin was invented for, here is a copy of u/hodlgentlemen's post back then;77bx9m;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/77bx9m/since_most_people_seem_to_have_already_forgot/

"Hypothetically, let's assume gold is convenient.  One person may park his 1.0 gram gold to a bank and say 0.7 gram is for saving which the bank can not lend to others and 0.3 gram is for ""investment"" which he bears some credit risk of being wipeout and gain some interest in return otherwise.  Then I think the economy is ok with some monthly statement from the bank and random due diligence to check the existence of the 0.7 gram gold.

Therefore, I don't think the easy-transact is the cause of fractional reserve takeover.  I think the root cause is people forget what sound money is and fail to distinguish the 0.7 gram of money and the 0.3 gram of money and falsely think this person has 1.0 gram of money; they will still make the same mistake by the convenient gold.";2;0;False;LucSr;don1doi;Since most people seem to have already forgot again what bitcoin was invented for, here is a copy of u/hodlgentlemen's post back then;77bx9m;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/77bx9m/since_most_people_seem_to_have_already_forgot/
"That argument is in favor of lending money; however, lending money does not require fractional reserve, it's a false equivalence. I have some cash in my pocket, I can literally draft up a contract and lend it to you for some interest (and take on the risk of default). And that was the function of banks in the beginning; p2p lending was cumbersome and difficult to research, so people entrusted an agent (banks) to do it more effectively. Banks later realized they have quite a bit of slack to lend out more than what they have when fiat was invented (first at banks, as credit notes), and that's how fractional reserve started. You really don't need fractional reserve to make use of sitting assets. To this day, some still believe banks only lend out the money they deposit...

The ""productivity"" argument is instead better suited as an argument for inflation, which will itself draw a lot hot debate in this sub. Fractional reserve right now is a means to get you inflation, albeit one that puts all the power and gains in the hands of bankers - a severely unjust situation in my view, no matter what your stand on inflation is.

"Yes, I agree, assuming that you have enough RAM memory.  However, even if you have a minimal amount of RAM you can still do verification and even with a slow disk.  You basically create a sequential file of all the UTXO transactions in order of time and then sort this by TXID.  Then go back and read the sorted TXIDs to make sure there are no double spends.  Then make one more pass over the block chain file to verify that all transactions balanced as to satoshis in and out.

Or if you want to verify randomly out of RAM and you can fit 1/N worth of the UTXO set you can do it with N passes to verify the double spends and one more pass to check the totals. (Obviously you can overlap this final pass.)  

There are many other possible ways to do this.  The main difference involved between doing off-line verification and running a node is that a node must verify in real-time and this precludes many optimization tricks.  (This discussion shows that it may be worthwhile to use separate code for initial node bootstrapping from that used to run once on line, as off-line algorithms can be more efficient, given certain hardware limitations.)

Assuming there are sufficient fast seeders for Bittorrent and that there are sufficient fast block sources, then the advantage of running a node while boostrapping comes from overlapping processing vs. network I/O.  Whether this is advantageous or not depends on the relative speed of network vs. local processing.  The maximum benefit of running a node occurs when the time to process is roughly the same as the time to download, giving appoximately a 2X speed up in real time.  If processing is much slower than bandwidth (or the oppposite) then there will be little penalty (ratio of times) for doing the Bittorrent approach.  As an example, if the local public library has a node and keeps a copy of the block chain, you could clone the necessary files at SATA speed and then you could take the disk(s) home and verify them at your leisure.

* Fake satoshi repeated that lie (or sold that lie to Roger, dunno who's crazy idea that was)

* Roger lied to you about his support for BCH, he certainly isn't buying it up now with all his millions

* The idea for big blocks is bad, because it means less and less people will run a full node

* The idea to not remove ASICBOOST is bad

* EDA is a bad idea

* Competing with Bitcoin on same PoW will not work. All altcoins learned that. Namecoin learned it the hard way and was dead for few months.

* You will not learn any of this in this echo-chamber / circle-jerk sub where you censored sub (downvote and then slowdown post rate so one can't reply even)

* You could learn all this all this and many smart technical info from Bitcoin Core, from whom you took their source code (big part on top of Satoshi's code, counting by features, besides SegWit too) or just talking to them instead of closig in own bubble

"Nobody actually reputable have said ""a few months away"", it was only less than two months ago with SW that implementing it on top of Bitcoin actually became feasible. This also meant a huge uptick in the amount of dev ressources that are being put into it.

The point is, there is light at the end of the tunnel, even if the consensus layer of Bitcoin is hard to change. It is still the project with most of the dev talent directed at it. They just launched a desktop app for actual user testing a week ago:

http://blog.lightning.engineering/announcement/2017/10/12/test-blitz.html

Before SW I was worried too that scalability would continue to be at a deadlock. Now with SW, we are (even if it's slow) seeing a gradual throughput increase on-chain and the realistic implementation of LN and much more exciting stuff. 

If you keep buying into the bullshit misinformation about these technologies you will keep missing out on being part of it. If censorship on a subreddit and hatred towards a few devs ends up costing you that, that would be incredibly sad.

Appropriate fee level depends on a few parameters:

* Tx size and 
* SW tx or not
* Confirmation time needed

A great source is:

https://bitcoinfees.21.co/

If you absolutely need to be in the next block you are going to pay for it. For a normal non-SW tx right now (let's say 400 bytes) I'd sent it with ~50 satoshi/byte or so equivilant to ~$1.2 at current prices, to be fairly certain of being included one of the next few blocks.

If I'm sending to an adress I own myself or the adress of a friend or family member I would do ~20-30 satoshi and expect it to clear in a reasonable time frame. I did as low as sub 10 sats/byte on Monday and was included in less than 20 minutes.

It all depends on the mempool, which have been bloated periodically but not been consistently bad since May/June, due to some obvious malicious spam txs (mempool history: https://core.jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#all).

"Correct.

1) Dumb FOMO from people thinking they will get free coins, not realizing that is not the case with the SegWit chains unless emergency measures are in place for the losing chain. 

2) Whales banking on that dumb FOMO and easily manipulating emotional traders

I have to admit I vastly underestimated these forces. I've started to accept it is what it is, regardless of what I think personally of the current state of BTC tech, it is driving 50% of the market and has the best brand recognition. FOMO really could just keep driving BTC upward for years and making fundamentals irrelevant while the crypto market eats the fiat system. As long as you own any of the top 10 strongest coins you'll not be disappointed.  A rising tide raises all boats, for that we should all be thankful to be in this market so early on.

"FOMO is bad because it's generally weak hands who succumb to it. Weak hands who get in for short term profit and who will likely panic sell at a loss when there is a correction.

If you're buying Bitcoin (Cash) at an ATH, make sure your hands are steady enough to hold for at least a year.

I tell everyone that my investment strategy is to sell at FOMO and but the FUD. Easier to say than to do, but probably one of the most valuable rule of thumbs if you want to avoid selling lows and buying highs.

"Ah, the good ole ""fundamentals are different"" argument. I'm old enough to remember 1999 and 2007, there were a metric crapton of people saying the _exact_ same things you did.

Not saying that the fundamentals aren't different; they are. GBTC et. al. now exists to attract a lot more older folks who do not give two shits about the future of money, or central bank shenanigans, or financial freedom. But the peak of any hype always goes way, way over whatever the underlying fundamentals are, as we've seen repeatedly throughout history.

FOMO is legit. I got in out of pure FOMO after being too lazy to get through the hoops needed to buy for 2 years although I believed in BTC since the start but thought the price would increase slowly. I got in at ~600 in the 2013 run. Hodled since then and even bought some more including ETH. If you get in because of FOMO just HODL :);2;0;False;Eirenarch;dona4hd;Bitstamp hits 6000 USD!;77mp95;https://imgur.com/T81V9BR

"In a free market society, things that are technically similiar can have completely different values. The technology and code of BTC and BCH is 99.99% the same. So the market is putting a 1200% premium on something that in GAAP would be labeled ""goodwill"". The market is saying the ""goodwill"" value of BTC is higher than BCH and that gap is widening. So something is fundamentally different in BTC that causes the mass public to put a greater value on it. This is what separates lead from gold. Metals that have similar characteristics, but completely different values.

You can close your eyes, or find out why the public sees more goodwill in BTC.";6;1;False;machinez314;don4t7y;Bitstamp hits 6000 USD!;77mp95;https://imgur.com/T81V9BR
