">How do you know the hard fork is contentious? How do you know it's not contentious **only** because of the censorship and drama created around it?

I suppose if it were released by core, it wouldn't be contentious, as the community would most likely simply accept it. If it's released by creating a new client, then it's by definition contentious, as this indicates that core does not approve of the fork. 

>Likewise, how do you know the fork is not needed? Yes, the price is rising, but how do you know that it wouldn't have been much higher (or lower) had the fork happened, or wouldn't have started rising a year ago instead of being rocked by panics infighting?

I guess I don't know these things, but who cares? It's not possible to know these things. The price is rising now, and fees are also rising, indicating a rising demand. This indicates to me that this is a bad time to make potentially permanently damaging changes to the protocol. 

>I'm sure the 5¢ to 10¢ fees to send a normal transaction aren't helping to convince people to adopt it either.

I don't think this really matters. It's the holders that matter; not the users. The holders are who keep the price from suddenly plunging, and it's this property of bitcoin which makes it a good long-term investment. We must attract long-term holders; not simply users who buy a little bit and then sell everything, or worse, weak hands who don't believe in the long-term success of the protocol and panic sell at the first sign of trouble. These people contribute nothing to the bitcoin price, and indeed may hurt it in the long run. 

User adoption will naturally occur in the next bubble. We don't need to do anything in particular to attract new users. They will come as the legacy financial system eats itself over the next few years/decades. We need to focus on *actual* scaling solutions ASAP. The blocks filling up has finally spurred the community to start coming up with all sorts of cool scaling solutions. Doubling the block size is a temporary solution that in the long run makes the problem even worse, because it *lowers* the cost of spam while providing no incentive to develop real solutions (like the lightning network). It's also a slippery slope, which encourages the community to simply fork in a higher block size every time the blocks fill up. Perhaps the first such fork is perfectly safe. But eventually, after doubling the block size many times, centralization pressures start to build. At that point, long-term holders will start to sell, because bitcoin will have permanently lost its most valuable feature: decentralization. 

I agree that a block size increase will be necessary eventually. But this should be a last resort, once all other methods of scaling have been exhausted. The current centralization in development is not permanently harmful to bitcoin, as it can easily be forked once it's clear that core is harmful to bitcoin. But once long-term holders start selling off because of increasing centralization in full node operation, there's no way to turn back the clock.

"If you want to learn why a contentious hard fork is an attack on bitcoin, read jratcliff63367's post.

I linked it because it was well-written and I didn't feel like typing out the same ideas again. His moderatorship is relevant because it shows he's not some nobody.

You say XT-blacklists are neither here nor there only because its inconvenient for your argument. Fact is, they show what poisonous ideas Mike Hearn had, how he had a totally different vision for bitcoin. His New York Times article proved that. People on this forum are happy to talk about luke-jr's Christianity but for some reason Mike Hearn's views are out of bounds now.

I like how you say the core developers are ""holding bitcoin hostage"" but Mike Hearn declaring himself dictator is absolutely fine. If users are free to run or not run BitcoinXT, then the same applies for Core.

I actually agree with the market solving things when possible. Back in summer 2015 TierNolan, myself and some others talked about creating a futures market for core-bitcoins and XT-bitcoins which would allow a market price between them to be found without a damaging contentious hard fork. Sadly nobody really followed through with the idea: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1157898.0 and the reddit discussion: https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3hqzvs/economic_majority_voting/ I actually did say I would trade XT for core but I wasn't able to find any XT-supporter willing to put their money where their mouth was. I wonder why.

Another point about the market, during the time of XT and Classic we saw that the bitcoin exchange rate dropped whenever it looked like a hard fork might happen: https://i.imgur.com/EVPYLR8.jpg So from my point of view the market has spoken here.

I bet if you asked around here, you'd find lots of support for XT. If not support then at least a vague feeling that it was a good idea, as opposed to an attack on bitcoin.";2;0;False;belcher_;da1p1oo;John Blocke: A (brief and incomplete) history of censorship in /r/Bitcoin;5cue13;https://medium.com/@johnblocke/a-brief-and-incomplete-history-of-censorship-in-r-bitcoin-c85a290fe43#.e4gz25xy9

Yes, it it's clear that r/bitcoin mods are participating in censorship. No, it's not clear that this censorship is bad for bitcoin. A contentious hard fork is clearly not needed right now. The price has been going up since the blocks filled up, as indeed it was doing so long before the blocks were full. Once it's clear that the current core devs are harming bitcoin (which will be clear if the price enters a bear market), then we can easily fork away from r/bitcoin and core. Until then, I don't really see the point. The price is going up, and development on cool features is happening faster than ever.

3. You keep talking about people and documents. You never mention code or software. You clearly have no idea how any of this works on a technical level.

Fact is BitcoinXT was a nasty attack on bitcoin. It would have had blacklists, it would have disconnected tor nodes, it would have installed Mike Hearn as dictator, it would have been the death of a decentralized bitcoin. All you hard forkers pushing it completely failed and it resulted in Mike Hearn leaving to go work for the banks. No wonder the big blocker side is a laughing stock.

Core are proceeding on the basis that the hard fork debate is over, justifying it by referring to the support they have. The issue is they believe their propaganda and deny there is any censorship.

">  it's by definition contentious, as this indicates that core does not approve of the fork.

By definition, Core is a key player? I don't think so. They are a key player by inertia, not by definition. Contention refers to views of the people who *actually* control Bitcoin: the investors, and - provisionally, by proxy - the miners. 

Anyway, I agree it is contentious. Just wanted to clear that up. The idea that the devs have any real say, besides in the very short term and by a kind of temporary threat, is a great misconception. They do have influence, but that is transient and waning the more they stall and beat around the bush with engineering contraptions and vaporware.

Their job is not to shape opinion, but to keep the group free of spam and other obvious abuse. It's pretty revealing to your mindset that you'd automatically think a mod's job is to shape opinion or that it has any bearing on a debate.

With that out of the way, you haven't stated how a contentious hardfork is an attack on Bitcoin, other than by assertion and an appeal to someone else's opinion. I say a contention is a potentially volatile situation, and a hardfork is exactly the way to resolve contention - by putting it to a market test. The alternative is to give undo bias to the status quo (beyond the status-quo bias the market would already grant) or allow devs to attempt to hold Bitcoin hostage by threatening to quit if any single one of their economic parameters are not adopted (keeping in mind they are not economic experts by any stretch). 

XT having blacklists is neither here nor there. It wasn't banned from /r/Bitcoin for that, but for simply breaking consensus with Core. The idea of ""Mike Hearn as dictator"" again shows you have apparently never given a single thought to how the economics of Bitcoin work. The market decides everything. Besides which, any upgrade posted by Mike Hearn to his repo must be approved by every node operator - except maybe if he slips in a soft fork, but that is of course the thing he has always railed against while Core has supported, so it would be pretty incongruous if that is what you meant. 

> All you hard forkers pushing it completely failed and it resulted in Mike Hearn leaving to go work for the banks. No wonder the big blocker side is a laughing stock.

Does this even warrant a serious response? I don't think so, but I might as well finish this out. You fail to understand how Bitcoin works even at the basic level. For example, in the future it will be commonplace for changes to be released over and over in various iterations and then not be adopted for months or even sometimes years, before they *are* finally adopted. How could it really be otherwise, as anyone can release code and rally some support. Not to mention the censorship contributing to XT's failure - the very subject of this whole thread. Not that I support XT, but heck you seem to have such a problem keeping context that I don't think it is worth continuing as you flail around with these partisan tangents.";4;2;False;Noosterdam;da1kmul;John Blocke: A (brief and incomplete) history of censorship in /r/Bitcoin;5cue13;https://medium.com/@johnblocke/a-brief-and-incomplete-history-of-censorship-in-r-bitcoin-c85a290fe43#.e4gz25xy9

Ok please tell me about what gets censored. I will go and post it right away if it doesent break any of the rules. I can prove there is no censorship that way, right? I will post about it for a whole week.

"No. Censorship on r\/bitcoin is enforced by a handful of moderators, not ""majority rule"". There is no majority enforced rule concerning censorship because *the greater half of censored posts are never seen by the majority in the first place*.";5;0;False;chernobyl169;da197eb;John Blocke: A (brief and incomplete) history of censorship in /r/Bitcoin;5cue13;https://medium.com/@johnblocke/a-brief-and-incomplete-history-of-censorship-in-r-bitcoin-c85a290fe43#.e4gz25xy9
