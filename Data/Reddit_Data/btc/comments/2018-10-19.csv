"> If I grow some food on my land I have created some valuable property.

No, you used the means of production (lands) to grow some food. You did not ""create"" property. Generally, the ownership of the production derives from the ownership status of the means of production.

If you don't believe that property rights are violently enforced, try talking to a homeless person. Edit: as far as I can tell, homeless people effectively have *no* property rights. Essentially they have no safe place to store their property. This works the same way for nomadic tribes; they do not ~~value~~ (privately own) anything they can not carry.";1;0;False;phillipsjk;e82b5lr;They make you pay to be able to pay;https://imgur.com/4A02fU4
"> Property has to come from the natural world. 

I don't know what you consider to be part of the natural world and what isn't. 

I also don't know what your point is.

> And property rights are backed by violence.

This is a really weird way to describe property rights. Sure: some people will use violence to protect their property. There are plenty of non-violent ways to protection your property too. Also: most my property requires no violence to protect it. Most people understand the value of proprty rights and have empathy so they wont attempt to personally violate your property rights.

> Property rights do not exist in the absence of government control/dispute resolution.

Wat.

If I grow some food on my land I have created some valuable property. I don't need a government worker to tell me it's mine. Most people around me will understand it's mine. I also don't need a government worker to protect my property from thieves. In most cases, the government worker is the person I need protection from. The government workers I'm referring to are the people that want to forcibly take my property from me.

I've said enough now that you have the opportunity to learn something.

I don't feel like spending any more time discussing this topic with you. I think it's likely I'll just be wasting my time.

"> Where did your stuff come from?

Mostly the market. I peacefully & voluntarily exchanged my property with other people to get their property. In almost all cases, both parties were left better off than before the trade happened. Businesses managed to provide me with many excellent goods and services **despite** the ongoing threats they have to deal with from the state, despite the state coercion against them and and despite the fact they and I are being continually robbed and extorted. Personally I think the predictability of the theft and extortion we face is what makes it survivable. It means we are able to budget for the theft. If I lived somewhere, where I did not know how much I would have to pay the local mob or when they would come knocking, it would be much harder to survive.

> No man is an island. ...

Your point? Who here is claiming a man is an island?

> ... The socialist view is that the world is collectively owned, and privatizing public property is theft.

Property is literally defined by one person/group having more right to a thing than another person/group. You can't have theft without property and you can have property without unbalanced, individual ownership.

Also: considering everyone in r/btc ""collectively own"" the reddit services (something which you say socialists claim), then that means I have as much right to the 'phillipsjk' user account as you do. As such, please hand over the username and password for that account to me so I can rightfully control it. I will be separately contacting the reddit admins for access to the reddit buildings (because apparently I collectively own them too). /s

Also: because ""the world is collectively owned"" and our bodies are part of the world, that means our bodies are collectively owned. This means that rape is no longer a thing; it's just simply one person using a part of collectively owned world property for a while.";1;1;False;hapticpilot;e81w6xj;They make you pay to be able to pay;https://imgur.com/4A02fU4
"Most Socialist have no objection to the personal ownership of some property. It just makes things work better that way.

Where it gets dangerous is when the means of production are privately owned. For example, is many places, it is illegal to capture rain-water because the whole catchment area is privately owned.

Regardless of adoption levels.

But as it turns out, you’re not new.  You’re just  brainwashed by Core to believe that bitcoin must have high fees with any increase in adoption. 

Guess what?  That’s wrong. Put bitcoin cash through the same bullrun BTC just went through and the fees will stay low.

As for this meme, three dollars is offensively more expensive than one penny. That was the point.

And even more aptly stated, to access your own funds in BTC, it’s completely free. You don’t need permission. And you don’t need to ask anybody for it. 

Even if you did however, the transaction fee would be a penny. So the comparison here is three dollars, or free.
