"I have done that blockchain analysis, hence my claim that he's a fraud and not a thief (at least not in the sense of stealing those coins). In addition to claiming to own coins stolen out of MtGox as well as coins clearly controlled by MtGox, several of the other claimed addresses can also be confidently tied to other people rather than to Wright. As far as anyone can tell, Wright himself never historically owned any significant amount of bitcoin, and just runs around pretending to own other people's bitcoin instead. That he included stolen MtGox coins in his list simply reinforces that he had no idea what any of those addresses were, or he would have presumably avoided ""implicating"" himself.

When the news of the lawsuit hit, Wright quickly denied that these coins were the fabled ""Tulip Trust"", so I guess now you're supposed to believe that there's *another* million BTC in a trust somewhere out there that he totally for sure owns (pinky-swear), unrelated to the million BTC in a trust that he was just caught lying about? Uh-huh.

I have a suggestion for you .  You should tell Kim Nilsson of WizSec to do some blockchain analysis on Nchain and Craig Wright.  The reason for this is that documents released in the Kleiman v Wright case indicated Craig may have claimed to hold private keys to Gox addresses.  Kim Nilsson already released an article stating this was proof Craig was a fraud, but it could also be proof Craig is a thief.  I doubt Craig is a thief and I actually think he is Satoshi, but if the documents in the case are legitimate and Craig claimed to own private keys to Gox addresses then the Gox creditors deserve to know why as that is highly suspicious.  His Tulip Trust is supposed to complete in 2020 so Kim Nilsson should just watch and ensure that he can't trace the coins that Craig moves out of the trust back to stolen Gox coins that he has been moving around through wallets owned by his associates for years to cover his theft.  Again, not trying to stir up heat in this community about CSW, I think he is Satoshi, but if he is a thief we need to know so someone should investigate the Bitcoin addresses in the claims in the documents of the Kleiman v Wright.;2;2;False;Imerman2;dwsbu2r;I'm Mark Karpelès, ex-CEO of bankrupt MtGox.

That's a good point, and it's a good thing many/most people can be level headed about something like this and move on in their lives in a healthy way. What I mean is, all it takes is for one or two of those people to become unhinged and try to do something crazy. Statistically the numbers are higher. Its why celebrities have to deal with insane stalkers etc. Most people are reasonable and noninvasive, but statistically there is a higher likelihood for a much much much smaller minority to act out, but in a very extreme potentially dangerous way. ;3;1;False;naorlar;dwta3gj;I'm Mark Karpelès, ex-CEO of bankrupt MtGox.

Your beautiful sentence, that I totally agree with, really states how it is that we can hold a level of Xusd per BTC at all ie. 6000$/4000$ being stronger and ever increasing stronger resistance levels, but my original point was about volatility. 


And by volatility I mean all the people entering in the future, probably being less smart and filtered out quicker than before ( Darwin ), results that whilst the next ATH may be 30k ballpark area, but we're also correcting harder, because the new hands are becoming ever increasingly weaker hands aswell.

"Diminishing huh? So when did we last see a 75% drop in price? Pretty sure that was exactly around the time *the biggest exchange in ecosphere got hacked*. 

It seems to me, if anything, that over time it got even more volatile. What ""real shitty news"" did we receive in Jan-March, that could justify, being up to par with Mtgox 80% volume hack? What did we have that was so concerning? We had Binance FUD, China FUD, SK FUD. That's it. Coinbase wasn't hacked, neither was Bitfiniex, nothing really happened.



And we still dropped 75%. 




I actually believe that people going in the market, are now less and less required to be smart about the tech behind it. I'd argue people in the past were more so in it for the tech, than for pure speculation. This is why, new people, with no idea, buying BTC at 18000$.  



In other words, as adoption grows and tech becomes easier to use, also implies that less techy people get involved, which means a lot of weak hands will enter the deck.

"Bc it is glaringly obvious he is not. He lied about his credentials. He studied theology. He’s a sham. 

More than likely it is Tatsuaki Okamoto or someone who knows him. It isn’t some guy who read the Bible and googled ‘how to crypto.’ It would be someone who had a long history of working in the industry in academia, government, and private industry. I mean all three. IE a university, writing research, and working for the NSA. Like Tatsuaki Okamoto. This sort of knowledge doesn’t just spring up over night. 

“Recently, several “divisible” untraceable off-line electronic cash schemes have been presented [8, 11, 19, 20]. This paper presents the first practical “divisible” untraceable1 off-line cash scheme” 

“we prove the security of the proposed cash scheme under some cryptographic assumptions. Our scheme is the first “practical divisible” untraceable off-line cash scheme whose cryptographic security assumptions are theoretically clarified.” 

“Note that coins divided from the same coin can be linked each other in the proposed scheme, although they are anonymous, i.e., “untraceable” from the customer’s identity. In other words, the unlinkability among divided coins is not satisfied, although the untraceability is satisfied.” 

This is from 1995. Annual International Advances in Cryptology Conference. Tatsuaki Okamoto submitted his paper in conjunction with NTT laboratories. PhD in Applied Math entirely achieved through University of Tokyo. Was working on this and wrote about it since the mid 80s. Also worked with the NSA. 

If it is not him it is someone who knows him very well. He may not know who it is but he likely has a good idea. It may not be him but someone followed his work very close.

"**Gaslighting**

Gaslighting is a form of manipulation that seeks to sow seeds of doubt in a targeted individual or in members of a targeted group, hoping to make them question their own memory, perception, and sanity. Using persistent denial, misdirection, contradiction, and lying, it attempts to destabilize the target and delegitimize the target's belief.

Instances may range from the denial by an abuser that previous abusive incidents ever occurred up to the staging of bizarre events by the abuser with the intention of disorienting the victim. The term owes its origin to the 1938 Patrick Hamilton play Gas Light and its 1940 and 1944 film adaptations.

"> that could justify, being up to par with Mtgox 80% volume hack?

How is the price determined in Bitcoin? The short answer is supply and demand, but on inspection, this is not like any other ""thing"" in history, I'll venture out on a limb and say it is the most supply inelastic thing ever.  

The price comes from speculation on future value. Arguably the value proposition does not change. The price goes up because of investor exuberance FOMO, and it comes back down when that fades. It is most accurately expressed in the [Mania and Blow-off phase in the hype cycle](https://bravenewcoin.com/assets/Uploads/_resampled/ResizedImageWzcyMCw0ODJd/four-stages-chart.jpg) when I entered Bitcoin we could see over 100% price growth in a day this volatility is diminishing as the network of speculators increases. 

While on the surface it may still look as volatile, daily volatility has shrunk and overall but not having looked at a measurement I can only express my opinion that I think the trend is still showing volatility decreasing over the 1, 7, 30, and 200-day moving averages. 

>What did we have that was so concerning?

"To my knowledge those documents with the Gox addresses were never provided by Craig, but instead were leaked to Gizmodo and Wired magazine.  The claim by the Craig Wright team is that Craig was being extorted and those documents were released by a hacker .  Because I have no idea what the truth is regarding who released the documents, and like you said there is no evidence of Craig Wright being a thief, then we need to explain Craig's immense Bitcoin fortune.  How do you explain Craig being bankrupt around 2008-2009 and never working again to now being insanely rich, self-funding much of the BCH infrastructure with his company Nchain that is internally funded?  Either he is pulling an elaborate scheme to say he is Satoshi to gain false respect (which he would be failing at miserably since everyone hates him), or he is telling the truth.  Occam's Razor says that the latter is more likely, since he has already failed at the former.  Therefore the more likely scenario is that Craig is Satoshi.

"Hi Mark

1 During the heydey of Mt Gox you were the most popular bitcoin exchange. A lot of child traffickers who accepted bitcoin via pedophiles using backpage.com would have laundered some of their ill gotten gains on your exchange. Did you help authorities identify and arrest these sick people?

2 It's impossible for a gaijin like you to do millions of dollars worth of business in Japan without regularly paying the Yakuza. How much were these payments worth and did you ever suspect that the stolen coins, which you covered up for months, involved organized crime?

"I expect that your reply to this will be along the lines of 'it was always theirs', but have you considered how your ideal plan (returning the original BTC to creditors), however unlikely it is, is just rewarding people for their own ineptitude?

I'm sure you will agree that holding a large number of coins on an exchange in the first place was a foolish exercise, and if your plans come to fruition you will have made some people very wealthy not just because of the first mistake of leaving the coins sat on Gox, but also by forcing them to 'hodl'. 

If Gox had never happened, the vast majority of your creditors would have traded away, wasted and sold their BTC over the years. You would now be returning BTC to them and instantly making many of them extremely rich, by virtue of their own incompetence. If you buy a winning lottery ticket but are stupid enough to lose it, the lottery aren't going to give you the winnings anyway.

"I had about 40 bitcoins stolen from MtGox in 2012. The transaction was made from an IP address that was not my own.  I am from North America and the IP address that the transaction was made from was in Eastern Europe. 

I had sent an email to support and received an initial reply but no satisfactory follow up was made. At the time I chose not to pursue the matter further given the relatively low value of bitcoin. I was also disappointed in your system that sent me an email saying that a transaction was done from an IP that was not my own but that gave me know recourse and that did not make the site more secure.  A good security system would have blocked the transaction coming form a strange IP address until some sort of confirmation could be made.

I had given up hope of getting my coins back when I heard of the MtGox bankruptcy.  

Now however I wonder if there is a chance of reopening the investigation into my stolen coins and if I can be considered a creditor that is owed money by MtGox.

Thank your lucky fucken stars you’re getting anything ... do you know how this shit normally turns out.

You scream black and blue that you were going to hold but this happening may have stopped a lot of people that would have sold and thus a blessing in disguise. The fact that you couldn’t sell could have also been a factor into why we had such a huge run up in the first place so whinging about not being able to get out at $19k may have never been possible.

* Silk Road opened in March 2011, when I took over MtGox
* The Silk Road operator created a home page with my hosting service (the only one to accept BTC at the time) to advertise silk road, resulting in silk road advertising page hosted on my own servers
* The bitcoin world was very small at the time, meaning MtGox would automatically profit from Silk Road
* Silk Road used multiple MtGox accounts to move bitcoins, resulting in a lot of connected transactions

Mark, don't listen to those few trolls here.  Those who listened to Kim Nillson's talk know that the truth of what happened was far more complex than people realize.  I'm not trying to remove blame from you but shit happens and people who held BTC at the exchange knew the risk.  Unfortunately I was one of them.  My question is this:  How realistic is it that creditors would be paid back fully?  I know the crypto world has expanded to many alt-coins now so you coould make profit from more than just Bitcoin itself, but to we are talking about over half a million BTC you would need to reimburse creditors.
