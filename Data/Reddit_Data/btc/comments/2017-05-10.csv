"> funds less secure

Your wallet is less secure than your safe. Of course.

> as a soft fork it's a squid-like nightmare with tentacles all over the place

Nope. It's a beautiful hack, and it's a soft fork, way better than exposing bitcoin to control by a few powerful people thanks to hard-forking. Do you read code?

> 8mb blocksizes would be safe at current network speed levels 

False, reference: http://fc16.ifca.ai/bitcoin/papers/CDE+16.pdf -- 4MB blocks centralize by taking 10% of the miners out of business

> LN doesn't work without a larger adaptive blocksize

False, it just doesn't scale to 7 billion users (we'll get there, but no urgency)
