"There's a few that I know of. They pretend to be a family member that somehow got stuck in a foreign country and needs money to get back. I don't know how they manage to convince them but the do. 

Sometimes they pretend to be a debt collector or a utility service or the IRS and request that the bill be paid with an ITUNES GIFT CARD. I had a very long conversation with a woman in why she couldn't put 1,200 dollars on iTunes gift cards to pay a bill. 

Sometimes to fake a prize. They convince them to send money by tricking them with a check for a small amount as good faith gesture for the whole amount. But first the scammed needs to send them money for some kind of verification step. Old person sends money, and the first check bounces.

">According to this page, it's a lot higher. Between 14.7 Million wallets and 15.9 Million depending on the time of transaction cannot pay for a single transaction. Today. Not in the future. Link

Interesting to know where I stood at 2016.

>Auctions don't charge more than a couple percent at the worst case. This is not the case with everything but transactions between the top 150,000 wallets. This is a very small pie, especially because a lot of BTC will be lost to the sands of time.

Incorrect. Most auction houses charge a minimum commission amount - this is usually a set fee, or a percentage of the sale if the fee is exceeded. If a piece of art is worth $100, and the auction commission is $250, this would make art not a very good store of value, by your standard.

>And I said that I disagreed, and posited that this is because of the first mover advantage. No one can prove it's your reason or mine.

No I didn't. You did.

>You did nothing to my opinion, this is the stupid attitude I'm talking about. I simply expanded on what I posted earlier.

The thing is, you do understand - see your later points.

>So, do you understand Metcalfe's law, care to weigh in?

That a value of a system/network can be approximately determined by the square of a number of the connected users, similar to how FB is determined in value? What of it?

>So do you understand monetary velocity, care to weigh in?

Difficult to say, as the transaction volume is clearly stunted by the transaction issues Bitcoin is stunting. I fail to see how this has any relation to store of value - as we've already covered, something with no utility (such as art) can still be classed as a store of value (I know you've already covered art later on, but let me tell you now that you are short-sighted in that regard - read on to find out more).

>See number 4. You think you know more than other people and you're simply wrong. This attitude bleeds into what you type, and makes you alienate people who you could learn from. But I guess you already knew that.

When you say something which has no utility has no store of value, then I do know more than you in that regard. Everyone knows something moreso than someone else - just because I know more about store of value than you, doesn't mean I know more than you about everything. I'm sure there are plenty of things you know more about than me. Try not to be so insecure. This is reddit, not a trial.

>The closest competitor to BTC does what it does and more. This is why I'm comparing them, what do you want to compare it to? They're both better stores of value than most things in the world right now, that's why we're here as apposed to r/goldbugs

So now BTC is a store of value?

I don't want to compare BTC to anything. I've mentioned art and gold, purely to illustrate the point to you that a store of value doesn't necessitate utility. You're adamant to bring in BCH for your transparent agenda of boosting BCH over BTC, which I've said time and time again that I'm not very interested in (being a holder of both, and finding the childish antics of /r/btc and /r/bitcoin to be mind numbing).

>Art= You can look at it, you can use it to explain oppression, you can use it to enlighten people, to bring order, to simply add colour to a . You can show beauty. I can keep going, but it's obvious when you go into a building that doesn't and then suddenly does have things on the walls. People wanting 'the best' of these drive up cost and the art world is also a money laundering racket.

By that same vein, BTC represents to many decentralization, anti-establishment, self-control, something ""cool"" to have. It doesn't matter if BTC is truly not any of these things, just as it doesn't matter if the piece of art which one viewed as beautiful, was actually a grotesque symbolism of the artist's pedophilia. It is the notion of value, prescribed by human emotion. This is purely what drives everything in the world.

So by this vein, you can understand how art has just as much utility as BTC, unless you are truly so superficial as to think just because you can see something, it has value - no value in any cryptocurrency then. 

>I'm speaking about the amount of wallets I talked about eariler.

I don't know what you're referring to.

>Please explain how the fees will go down as more people try to transact on it. If you say LN, best case is 50% reduction from the horse's mouth.

I believe you want to go to LN. You're diverting this away from the topic of discussion, which is that you believe a store of value needs utility, which it doesn't.

"The idea with calling it ""Bitcoin Cash"" is to make the intent clear that its community would like to not be considered just another altcoin, but instead a fork vying for the title of Bitcoin. The community backing BCH feels like the core BTC coin has veered off-track from the founding principles of Bitcoin. If BTC dropped to $0 and all hash power transferred to BCH, the community around BCH would want to assume the Bitcoin name.

99.9% of people calling Bitcoin Cash ""bcash"" are not just shortening the name, but are intentionally trying to distance the coin in people's minds from the core concept of Bitcoin. Doing so paves over the long history and scaling debate that gave birth to the fork, and pushes the narrative more in lines of BCH being just one of ~1400 arbitrary cryptocurrencies.

"The idea with calling it ""Bitcoin Cash"" is to make the intent clear that its community would like to not be considered just another altcoin, but instead a fork vying for the title of Bitcoin. The community backing BCH feels like the core BTC coin has veered off-track from the founding principles of Bitcoin. If BTC dropped to $0 and all hash power transferred to BCH, the community around BCH would want to assume the Bitcoin name.

99.9% of people calling Bitcoin Cash ""bcash"" are not just shortening the name, but are intentionally trying to distance the coin in people's minds from the core concept of Bitcoin. Doing so paves over the long history and scaling debate that gave birth to the fork, and pushes the narrative more in lines of BCH being just one of ~1400 arbitrary cryptocurrencies. This is felt to be disrespectful in the BCH community, and so they'd prefer not to have it called ""bcash"".";9;0;False;sabrathos;drxdcrp;Thank to this community's effort, Forbes has corrected Kyle's Torpey's LN article to clarify LTC tx fees is much higher than BCH.
