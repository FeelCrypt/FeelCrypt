Avalanche should allow miners (and other large nodes) to utilize their resources more efficiently by severely dampening huge spikes in workload. It also nearly eliminates any accidental orphan risk from block races, allowing them to add more fees to the block with less risk.

"Hi im_uname.

I'm still not completely convinced it's a consensus rule.  Here's why:

If the mining consortium breaks up 1 month into their 6-month plan, then blocks that do not follow the deposit rule will be/remain valid and not be orphaned.  Therefore, all nodes enforcing this rule is incorrect behavior and we will have a minority split if the consortium fails (if, and only if, all nodes enforce it as a consensus rule--which again: they should *not* do).

Instead, exchanges and high-value transfers should rely on multiple confirmations, not just 1.  Additionally, determining which mining organization receives your double spend is non-trivial, so this double-spend via orphaning does not break merchant 0-conf in a way that is even remotely reliable (or cost effective), in my opinion.

Either you're advocating for a literal democracy, or your arguing for a 1 BCH - 1 Vote (which is proof of stake). Neither represent the governance model of Bitcoin.

People who like BCH for being p2p cash aren't going to sell merely because 12.5% of the block reward is going to devs. People are at least going to wait until something negative comes of the agreement; Until then, this is miner game theory playing out in the free market.


>Things change. Look at how the Segwit2x agreement (predictably) changed before the 2x part was activated. This protocol change risk is far from ""minimal"".

Things were different. Free speech was suppressed, and miners have never experienced their own utter failure before. There was also only one node implementation with any significant power, and it got took over by bad actors.

Things are different because we have multiple node implementations, very experienced miners, and free speech allowed in the main communication channels.

Also with S2X the entire situation was based on UASF, or a power pull from node operators assisted by Bitcoin Core to force protocol change. In this case, the risk isn't what the miners decide in the future, it's making sure all our node implementations don't coordinate an attack with node operators. **If we can trust EITHER the miners or the majority of the node implementations, then we can trust corruption to be mitigated.**

"> the cost will fall on to the miners who donate, rather than be spread across the entire SHA256 hash power.

It's a wierd take. It's not that miners bare the cost, it's holders getting less security for the same pay. 

Sure there's less money for SHA256 miners, as is the case on halvings for example. Some might need to turn off unprofiable miners, and less hashpower will secure the SHA256 coins. But - it doesn't spread, only the coin that went through halving (or a new dev tax) will lose half the hash rate, the others will get the same. 

In the case of halving, holders lose security but also pay just half. In the case of a dev tax, they get less hashrate, but still pay the same.

What's especially anoying is how the miners behind this forced tax pretend to be ""donors"" where in fact they bare almost no cost (this *does* spread) while softforking into the protocol a mandatory payment, out of the block reward, to an hardcoded address of their Hong Kong entity.

Again, the block reward is a a payment holders make to miners in order to buy security. They pay with inflation. If you give them less security for the same payment - it is they that are the donors. Not the miners that just give less hasrate in return, and certainly not the miners signed on this plan, that actually take the money and the influence in buys, without ""donating"" anything.";1;1;False;yo2efxx;ffad0sh;Infrastructure Funding Plan for Bitcoin Cash by Jiang Zhuoer (BTC.TOP);esebco;https://medium.com/@jiangzhuoer/infrastructure-funding-plan-for-bitcoin-cash-131fdcd2412e

>>This means the code will need to be ready soon for testing and deployment.
>>
>>We will work with the various Bitcoin Cash node implementations to include code to implement verification of this miner funding as part of the May 2020 protocol upgrade.

I should have been more specific.  Their orphaning rules will require code, yes, and the logic for determining which chain to build off may exist within the node software, but this isn't code that is run within every full node, and non-modified full nodes will not consider blocks violating this policy as invalid.  So yes technically, miners will need a custom modification to their `getblocktemplate` (which is an BU/ABC command-line function (RPC), not a bitcoin protocol concept), but calling this a protocol change or even a Node change is disingenuous.

To sum it up as an analogy: this is similar to a miner wanting to include the block's transaction count as a part their coinbase (which is hypothetically [allowed by the protocol](https://bitcoinprotocol.cash/protocol/blockchain/block#coinbase-transaction)).  This functionality doesn't exist, but could exist for their consortium, but there is no current mining configuration field that says, ""include tx count in coinbase"", so they'll have to pay a developer (or organization) to include it.

"> We spent a lot of time in the past getting the point across that soft-fork consensus changes are still consensus changes.

Firstly and foremost: I agree that soft forks are consensus changes.

Admittedly, the more I think about this the more torn I become though.  I never considered this a ""soft fork"", but it's also not completely dissimilar.  It's not a traditional soft fork because block and transaction validity is not changed.  What I mean is, consider the P2SH SF from long ago.  Transactions that only provided the script preimage but not the unlocking portions of the script have different validity across the full nodes.  If you fail to provide the rest of the P2SH parameters than nodes will consider the tx invalid, while others (un-upgraded nodes) consider it valid.  In contrast, both blocks would be ""valid"", but one will just get orphaned as long as the consortium holds enough hash power.  Full nodes will be completely unchanged and its just a mining policy. ...but it can still result in orphans, so.. Yeah.  It's grey area in my mind.

">It's everyone's decision

I disagree. Bitcoin isn't supposed to reinvent democracy. And also it clearly isn't meant to enable banks via proof of stake. The killer feature of Bitcoin governance is that capitalist miners are in control, which takes power from banks, governments who are bad with money, and from the tyranny of democracies.

Most people seem in support of this, your actually one of the first critics out of dozens of people commenting on this...

Since this is a temporary change to the coinbase reward with a planned cut-off date, the risks really are minimal. 

It would be wrong for node implementations to coerce miners into a decision like this, but if miners themselves want to do something like this, it's because they think it would be beneficial.

And if I remember correctly, Amaury Sechet (u/deadalnix) has actually voiced potential support for an idea like this, because he seemed to understand the minimal impact on security.

**Ultimately, I think it's the miners responsibility to fund development.** The miners can choose to donate directly, or come to a joint agreement like this, depending on how much they trust each other.

Now, the node implementations could implement this in such a way that it's only activated by the miners who want it - which would mean no consensus change by default.

">Miners work for the market.

Yes and no. That's kind of an elusive statement, but it has some truth value. The miners are incentivized to regard the market, but they definitely don't have to. The relationship between miners and the market isn't a relationship of power, it's a relationship of incentives. This is different from the relationship between miners and developers, which is a relationship of power.

That being said, I think the miners have regarded the market, due to the majority of people seeming to be in enthusiastic agreement, and due to their effort to make this as low-risk as possible.

I trust that the miners have some kind of an idea of what they're doing. And both the miners and the developers could easily phase this out before the end-date of six months if it for any reason becomes necessary (but I don't think six months is long enough for corruption to mold over).

If all the dev groups want to phase this out, the miners would probably become unable to proceed without a lot more expense and risk. If the miners want to phase this out, then it would be trivial to do and hard for node implementations to stop them unless they all coordinate to stay in power. Either way, this seems like a safe strategy to proceed carefully with, as it has more ways it can fall apart than it does to go wrong.";3;0;False;J-Stodd;ff9qrhe;Infrastructure Funding Plan for Bitcoin Cash by Jiang Zhuoer (BTC.TOP);esebco;https://medium.com/@jiangzhuoer/infrastructure-funding-plan-for-bitcoin-cash-131fdcd2412e

"###Highlights:

> **Therefore, various major BCH mining pools (BTC.TOP, Antpool, BTC.com, ViaBTC, Bitcoin.com) are preparing to implement a 6-month short-term donation plan. This plan aims to provide sufficient funds for BCH developers to accelerate the BCH development before the upcoming bull market in 2020–2021/22.**

> **To provide this funding, we intend to direct 12.5% of BCH coinbase rewards to a fund that will support Bitcoin Cash infrastructure.This funding will last for 6 months, and it will provide significant and much needed support to the Bitcoin Cash ecosystem.**

> **It makes the most sense to activate this feature at the same time (and in conjunction with) the May 15th protocol upgrade. This facilitates a consistent rollout among ecosystem participants. This means the code will need to be ready soon for testing and deployment.**

> **We will work with the various Bitcoin Cash node implementations to include code to implement verification of this miner funding as part of the May 2020 protocol upgrade.**

"**I'm against this plan.**

**It wasn't properly publicly debated first.**  
It's a very risky major change to the protocol.  
It seems temporary but could become permanent.  
BU should get 0 USD in (forced) ""donations"". Will they?  
This is bad for BCH.  

""[..], miners will orphan BCH blocks that do not follow the plan.[..]""

This seems like a power move by the miners to increase their influence and control over the BCH protocol. I really hope that I'm wrong about that and that this forced funding will turn out better than how the Blockstream, Bitcoin Foundation, and Nchain funding has turned out.

Infrastructure funding should be voluntary, not a part of the BCH protocol.

This whole situation reminds me of how companies underfunded internal IT departments in 1990-2000 (and many still today) because they just couldn't understand how increasingly important IT had become to their own companies. The companies that understood this and spent a very significant amount of money on ""internal IT costs"" became so profitable and grew so large that they eventually became like Facebook that tries to create its own private currency now.

And why base the company that's going to decide where the ""donated"" money goes, in Hong Kong? Isn't that unnecessarily risky considering that China seems to be in a war with Hong Kong trying to make it just another part of China? China seems much more unfriendly even hostile towards the Bitcoin invention than a sovereign Hong Kong.

"I know that this may be too complicated for BTC fans to understand, but let's try:

+ The mission of Blockstream/Core is to reform bitcoin according to Greg Maxwell's concept

+ Greg says that the network should be permanently congested, because the fees must be very high to sustain the current hashpower as the block reward falls.

+ Greg believes that, once the network is permanently congested, a ""fee market"" will develop.  Namely, there will be a reasonably stable fee x delay function, and each user will be able to control the confirmation delay by paying an appropriate fee.

+ The network started to become congested in 2016, when traffic  hit the max capacity (144 MB/day) at peak demand times.

+ The network was congested most of the time from Feb/2017 to Mar/2018, with average daily traffic very close to the capacity.  Clearly, usage was not increasing because it was just not possible.

+ SegWit was enabled in 2017-08-01, and afforded a small increase in capacity; however, adoption was slow, so the effective capacity basically remained the same during the above period.  (Today, with ~60% adoption, it is ~205 MB/day.)

+ Still, during those 13 months that the network was effectively saturated, there was no sign of Greg's ""fee market"" developing.  In fact, it did not become *permanently* saturated, as Greg expected. 

+  Instead, what happened was exactly what network theory predicted, and Mike Hearn and others had tried in vain to explain to Greg.  Namely, there was a random series of huge backlogs, some lasting several weeks, separated by periods without backlog.  Just before and during the backlogs, there was no ""fee market"" because the fees needed to get through were impossible to predict, and all ""fee estimators"" were *necessarily* broken.  During the periods with no backlogs, there was no ""fee market"" because even the minimum fee would give confirmation in the next block.

+ After Mar/2018, the daily incoming traffic dropped for unknown reasons, at one point to less than 50% of the capacity.  It partially recovered, but by May/2019 it was still 80% of the capacity.  Then it started dropping again,and now it is at about 70%.  

+ Unlike the situation in 2017, the low value of tx/day seen in the last two years is not due to any constraint.  Without congestion, fees are minimal and most transactions are confirmed in the next block.  It is just that the *demand* for BTC service today is only 70% of what it was in 2017, and dropping.

The coming inflation in Lebanon and Argentina for instance, will be good for some, disastrous for others, depending on their capital being in goods or money when it happens.

Slowly, it will turn over to usage. Still, I am a bit disappointed when I, as a part of the introduction to someone, discover that the only thing they are interested in, is to turn it over to local fiat the same day, and spend it.

"> Lindy effect

The problem is that the people who are the best at hoarding wealth are the ones who are actively fighting to stop cryptocurrency from being used as currency.

These people/groups/families control the world's wealth right now, and have already amassed a very big percentage of the major cryptocurrencies.

All these entities have to do is manipulate the price of crypto relative to fiat currencies while pushing ""stable coins"" to make crypto less usable as a currency.

That's what's holding cryptocurrency back. It will take a transfer of wealth from these entities to normal people using crypto as money before it can really take off.

Crypto needs to become a widespread ideological movement.

"So you're working on the assumption that the only businesses processing crypto within Australia are using TravelByBit and/or possibly your company(?). That would leave out businesses doing their own payment processing or using other payment providers would it not?

Also I notice that LivingRoomOfSatoshi (LoS) does quite a bit of payment processing in Australia (albeit not a merchant themselves). The stats there paint a less flattering picture for BCH (and BSV) compared to BTC.

https://www.livingroomofsatoshi.com/graphs/

At the time of writing:

BTC: 62.8%

BCH: 2.8%

BSV: 3.2%

LN: 3.2%

I didn't check volumes compared to those contained in your report, but would wager what goes through LoS is a higher volume than through other payment processors, meaning, alas, that BTC is still king in Australia. (Believe me, I'm not a fan of that, but we can't ignore reality).

I think what could be interesting to watch (and I am starting to do this as of today) is what the emerging trends are. If a trend starts to emerge over some months that's more powerful, IMHO, than absolute values. e.g., I have a suspicion that the BTC trend is tending downwards, and cryptos like BCH and BSV upwards. LN looks to be still born; maybe in 18 months it will pick up.

"> Talking about cherry picking data lol... you chose the one specific data that you believe serves your narrative.

We're talking about usage and what we **can** say about it without introducing a bias by arbitrarily selecting transactions. So it's the whole set of transactions. Not an arbitrarily limited set defined by someone trying to sell you their Point-of-Sale. If you can't see the difference between the two I'm afraid I can't help you.

>  daily BCH $ volume on exchange.

Reported by exchanges which are know for wash-trading to inflate those numbers for obvious marketing reasons.

> BCH $ transfered onchain 

Finally, something verifiable and not from an inherently biased source, [let's take a look](https://i.imgur.com/qfRB4dJ.png).

The value moved this way on BTC is one order of magnitude larger than BCH, and it seems that BCH is trending toward BSV's level lately... which is not up.

The only caveat here is that the cheaper it is to transact on a chain, the cheaper it is to manipulate most metric (moving around the same funds over and over again), so it's not really the best measure of usage for *just* commerce obviously (which is generally what is considered ""adoption"" around here). It still isn't a reason to go to an extreme and like in OP's arbitrary case suddenly only look at brick and mortar shops (and in addition pretend this represent the most relevant kind of usage).

Unfortunately, I think not. The expected number of block intervals (say 10 minutes) to mine a block in Bobtail is equal to S (k+1) / (2 t h) where S is the size of the hash space, t is the target, and h is the expected number of hashes performed (see Lemma 4 [here](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~gbiss/bobtail.pdf)). When h is appropriate for the target (i.e. tuned by the DAA), then S (k+1) / (2 t h) = 1. But let's say hash rate drops to half, h' = h/2, then S (k+1) / (2 t h') = 2. That is to say, cutting the hash rate in half will double the expected block time.;2;0;False;bissias;ff8z4fs;Regarding the recent and ongoing BCH DAA gaming, I have been learning a little bit about Bobtail - and I think it will help with this problem.;es5yvu;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/es5yvu/regarding_the_recent_and_ongoing_bch_daa_gaming_i/
"Yes, it's true that every miner will submit its 8 lowest hashes. But if a miner has, say, 10% of the hash rate, then the probability that the average of his best 8 hashes is below the average of the remaining miners' best 8 is much less that 1/8. It decreases exponentially with k. 

But this is assuming the 10% miner acts in isolation. If he doesn't plan to double-spend, then he will contribute his proofs to the proofs of the other miners. They will assemble a block collaboratively, and the 10% miner will receive a reward for each of his proofs included in the block (which will be 10% of them on average).";1;0;False;bissias;ff8w4k4;Regarding the recent and ongoing BCH DAA gaming, I have been learning a little bit about Bobtail - and I think it will help with this problem.;es5yvu;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/es5yvu/regarding_the_recent_and_ongoing_bch_daa_gaming_i/

"I just wanted to address a few points brought up here.

First, my opinion is that the primary benefit of Bobtail is that it can achieve the same security against double-spend and selfish mining attacks as Bitcoin with just a fraction of the hash rate. The hash rate ratio [will not rise](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~gbiss/greedy_equil.pdf) against BTC until the coin price does. So while it's true that spending on things that tend to improve coin value will eventually increase security, deploying Bobtail would deliver a concrete security improvement immediately.

Second, I'm only aware of one way that Bobtail can directly improve the DAA. That would be to leverage the larger statistical sample (using the PoW in the full set of proofs) to derive a more accurate estimate of current hash rate. I'm curious to hear if that is what the OP has in mind, or if it was something different. 

Third, I agree that deploying Bobtail would be a significant change to the consensus mechanism, but it could be made incrementally. For example, BCH could first deploy weak blocks (no consensus changes), then storm (a small change to the orphaning rules), and finally Bobtail. Other paths are also possible.";4;1;False;bissias;ff8v8vp;Regarding the recent and ongoing BCH DAA gaming, I have been learning a little bit about Bobtail - and I think it will help with this problem.;es5yvu;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/es5yvu/regarding_the_recent_and_ongoing_bch_daa_gaming_i/
"> If BCH had K value of, say, 8 then the miners trying to game the DAA would have to cooperate with 7 other miners, or simulate being 8 miners at once (hence solving the puzzle 8 separate times - which insantely inefficient).

I'm not sure if this is right - I though bobtail worked on the premise that there was no cooperation between miners and that the default is that each miner gets their own average.

Also not that getting an ""average"" that matches the requirement is not the same thing as meeting the requirements K times, as stated above.

All in all though, I'd be much for a change like this, and I think a K value of 4 might be good enough.";3;1;False;JonathanSilverblood;ff8ff0o;Regarding the recent and ongoing BCH DAA gaming, I have been learning a little bit about Bobtail - and I think it will help with this problem.;es5yvu;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/es5yvu/regarding_the_recent_and_ongoing_bch_daa_gaming_i/

So why exactly wouldn't a miner just submit its 8 best solutions?

"Sure. Imagine that you have two miners A and B: A has 10% of the hash rate and B has 90%. When mining for a fixed period of time, say 10 minutes, the expected value of the minimum hash is v/10 and v/90 for miners A and B, respectively, where v is the expected lowest hash value overall. Lemma 2 in the latest [Bobtail draft](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~gbiss/bobtail.pdf) shows that the expected values of the average of the k lowest hashes for A and B are then (k+1)v/20 and (k+1)v/180, respectively. 

So you can see that miner B expects to have a much lower average hash than miner A after the same period of time. Lemma 4 gets into how long it takes for each given a fixed target (sort of the inverse problem).

"Yes, it's a known problem. Miners with lots of hashrate are gaming the difficulty adjustment algorithm. They'll leave BCH mining completely to allow the difficulty to go way down, then they'll suddenly come back online with massive hashpower and mine a bunch of blocks on the easier difficulty. Then they'll leave again... etc. This results in many blocks being suddenly found within a few minutes while other times blocks are not found for hours.

**Edit:** I should point out this problem exists as a consequence of the unexpected need to split from the BTC chain. On Bitcoin BTC the difficulty algo doesn't change for about 2 weeks (about every 2016 blocks). This was set this way precisely to prevent large swings in hashrate significantly affecting the 10 minutes per block target. When BCH split, though, it was necessary to change this because the sudden drop or increase in hashrate could make service unreliable; for example, a ton of hashpower could set the BCH difficulty really high, then vanish where blocks wouldn't be found for 2 weeks... not good, it was an attack vector.";24;3;False;cryptos4pz;ff7pl4p;BCH Blocks being rapidly found?;es3ogx;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/es3ogx/bch_blocks_being_rapidly_found/

"\>  Looking at total hashes/ps is not the best indicator of how secure your pow chain is.

This is wrong, on the upper end of what is physically possible, it comes down to energy expenditure modulated by hardware available. That's SHA-256 and it's no contest.

\> Take for example xmr which currently is asic resistant.

Do you know how many times they've said that before? And in turn, how many times they were wrong? Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and I don't see it happening.

\> renting out cpu cores on aws etc.

But let's give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they actually do accomplish ASIC resistance, now just hiring a botnet for enormously lower money is the way to get maximum ROI, even assuming that the ASIC resistance actually works, which there is very little reason to actually assume given precedent.

ASIC resistance is something that sounds great in theory, but then you actually think about it and analyse how it works in the real world, and the fact it's very likely not possible, and it never turns out that way.

\> The issue with sha256 is that bitcoin already uses it, so bch is at the  mercy of the sha256 stats you claim is bch saving grace.

All the SHA-256 chains are at the mercy of the net total of SHA-256 miners, and BTC more than the other two given it's difficulty adjustment algorithm makes it very possible to outright destroy it permanently. BCH is the only practical long term viable SHA-256 chain presently in existence, the other two will either improve and become viable threats or remain what they are now and fade away over time.

"Hmm.

Could've been a tenth of one cent or less with Bitcoin Cash and probably wouldn't have had to wait as long for the mempool to clear the artificially retarded 1mb block.

Still a very impressive demonstration of the capabilities of crypto in general as the premier contender to traditional banking entities, so congratulations to the mover for timing their BTC transaction when the blocks aren't inundated and fees aren't ludicrously high.  


Edit: To head off the trolls, I understand even a $100 fee to be mined in the next block for a $USD 450 million transfer is negligible, but wouldn't 1/10th of one penny $USD, instantly, be better? =)";2;1;False;bolognapony234;ff7h7x4;$445 million in Bitcoin transferred for just $0.25 - Yahoo Finance;es1wau;https://finance.yahoo.com/news/445-million-bitcoin-transferred-just-100054703.html
Yes, in the given transaction, a fee equal to $0.004 USD is (0.004 / 0.25 =) **62.5 times better** than BTC.  That much lower fee makes bitcoin competitive even against fiat's best captive offerings.

The Edge Wallet can do this pretty easily for you. Just send some BCH into the Edge wallet, and then they have an option which enables you to split your BCH into both BCH and BSV.;2;1;False;scotty321;ff84lu1;Bch/Bsv Split Question.;es1bce;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/es1bce/bchbsv_split_question/
"kraken used to have this flawless system where you sent them BCH and your BSV appeared in the same address.  I did this with a wallet I hadn't touched since the split.  But, for some reason, the last batch of BCH i sent there did not get transferred.  One explanation might be that I was airdropped either some BSV or BCH satoshies or something.  

So realize that this method is also not full proof.

One method I really like, but have not tried myself is to send your wallet some BCH that is already split.  Then transfer the entire amount of BCH to another address - boom you have split your coins!

"Ok, I think it will produce replayable transactions. It not, it will move only the BCH. But there is no problem in the case of trezor, because you can always move them with ElectrumSV afterwards.

In fact, if you don't need to move BCH to coinex, you could just go with Electron Cash (first, move to an address in the same wallet) and ElectrumSV. (I think maybe ElectrumSV makes replayable transactions, not sure, therefore split with Electrion Cash first)

Since it is a hardware wallet, there is no special security precautions, the key will not come over to the PC.

If he sends all his BCH to a new address with Electron cash these coins will be safely beyond the reach of any BSV wallet software because they will be on the BCH only fork. If he then runs ElectrumSV the wallet will see only pre split coins plus any (probably none) on the BSV only fork.  Then move all of these BSV coins to a new wallet, so he can keep all his addresses straight.

"This article contains BSV ""pumping text"" designed to support BSV and suggest BCH is doing poorly:

"" Controversial currencies like Craig Wright’s [Bitcoin S.V. (BSV)](https://cryptobrowser.io/coins/bitcoin-cash-satoshis-vision/) also see enhanced gains, as opposed to [Bitcoin Cash](https://cryptobrowser.io/coins/bitcoincash-bch/)  (BCH). Despite the market correcting itself and Bitcoin Cash almost  losing traction, Bitcoin S.V. started the year with a gigantic leap. BSV  is currently trading at $313.26, and Bitcoin Cash is just 30 dollars  above – trading at $343,05 as of press time. The market cap difference  also shrinks rapidly – the fourth largest crypto in the world, Bitcoin  Cash, leads by only $547 million in terms of market capitalization. BSV  recorded а 200% price increase in a matter of two weeks after U.S.  District Judge Beth Bloom ruled in favor of Wright in the lawsuit  against him by the Kleiman estate. The other major milestone, which  could be one of the forces responsible for the price boost, is the  scheduled for Feb. 4th “Genesis” hard fork. The update would eliminate  the hard cap on block sizes, which could boost transaction volumes.  However, the crypto community believes that the price pump before the  hard fork would have little to no effect, as the price would dump back  after the hard fork.

It is perfect for that.

One of my standard lines:

In general, it is sound money, supposed to counter fiat, be somewhat stable, but it will increase slowly due to increased productivity. So if someone can make a mousetrap more efficiently, the result will be a lower price in the market for that mousetrap, wages steady. The expectation at this time is far higher, and that is for the reason that the money type is not much used, but will be. It is an effect of the initial distibution. It is risky, but the expectation (or the possible outcomes weighed to the probability of each) is positive. The most probable direction is up in value. The risk is mitigated by not going all in.";1;0;False;ErdoganTalk;ff8vpl6;It's Tipping Tuesday! - Toss a Coin to Your BCHer;ervfol;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/ervfol/its_tipping_tuesday_toss_a_coin_to_your_bcher/

I'm not comparing the downvotes - I'm comparing the rate limiting. When you have negative karma in this sub it prevents you from posting beyond a comment or two. So for example if you and I are having a back and forth discussion and you happen to be in favor of bch whereas I am in favor of big blocks on btc, you can continue to debate as much as you like but I will be prevented from offering more than my initial perspective. It's not exactly the same as manual censorship but it has a very similar effect. I can't tell you how many times I've written up a thoughtful response to a comment here just to have it denied and I end up just deleting it and moving on. I can only assume if it's happening to me it must be happening to many around here - I don't think I have particularly controversial opinions overall. The end result though is that an outside observer reading this subreddit will see a bunch of pro-bch posts and very few pro-btc posts and possibly arrive at an inaccurate view of what the actual group consensus is. Ironically this is exactly what happened on r/bitcoin and what led to the creation of r/btc in the first place.

Fortunately in Bitcoin the supply and demand works between nodes and miners, where nodes provide the supply of blockspace that they are willing to validate. The demand from miners is just to mine whatever supply of blocks is most profitable, which is why most miners mine Bitcoin blocks.

Nodes can increase the supply of blockspace but this is difficult and requires consensus, the last time this succeeded was with the SegWit upgrade.

Well, mining IS quite a gamble anyway, that's the price to pay when you enter the game. However, he mines BCH, sells it, buys USDT, so, unless Tether finally collapses - he's protected from any fluctuations of BSV price in the meantime, if the price of BSV falls - even better - he gets more BSV than if he mined it. Then he buys BSV when volume is low. Just the fact of buying for a few millions of USD virtually guarantees that the price goes up. In the meantime FOMO crowd joins and pumps the price even higher. He gets BSV and the current price is much higher than if he had just mined it. Then he does whatever his original plan was, when he decided to be a BSV miner. So one thing to do would be to sell it when the price is at the top...;1;0;False;readcash;ff8dar2;Is that how pump and dump works?;erimqh;https://i.redd.it/7ox2r9acozb41.png

The answer is, you can't because Craig said he wont let criminals and money launders use BSV.

nChain knows where they came from. Besides the recent censor was for large deposits to stop price dumping before Calvin's crew cashed out.
