"I am not confused, but it's good to see that you're doubling down on your position.

> They might offer all those services and all those services will be very useful.

Did I ever say the services would not be useful? No, I did not. Whether they are useful is besides the point. 

> You are missing the point.

No, I am not. You are missing the point of Bitcoin completely. What these services providers, whether I call them banks or you decline to call them banks, are centralized services that take the place of the current banking services. 

> There will be numerous Coinbases offering the same services, that's what capitalism is.

Yes, there will, and they'll be banks also. I'm goign to leave your ""capitalism"" comment alone simply because it's just an attempt to side track what I am saying.

> They can not be banks.

If they offer the same services as a bank, they are a bank. 


> They can not loan out coins that you never gave permission for.

Until such time as they put in their ToS the ability to do such a thing.

>  If you do store your coins in one of Coinbases future services, they could use it to give out loans to people who want to buy a house and pay with Bitcoin Cash.



>  You think we are out to destroy banks, we are not.

Who is this ""we"" shit? It really irks me when individuals, such as yourself, decide what ""we"" are doing or not doing. YOU are not out to destroy banks. YOU do not speak for anyone else but yourself. Stop trying to include others in your ""we"".

The rest of what you've said simply reinforces, at least to me, that Coinbase, and other service providers that are similar to them, will become the new banks. You can call them ""service providers"", I'll call them banks.

You cite these backroom deals as if they're gospel.  I don't care about ""NYA"", coinbase text signaling, ""DCG"", or any other double secret pinky swear nonsense that you're obviously obsessed with.

I'm a developer.  I evaluate code.  I run what makes sense.  Segwit is technically sound.  There is no legitimate criticism to speak of.  It fixes multiple problems with Bitcoin *and has no down side*.  But you won't ever debate me on the technical points.  You'll always bring up conspiracies instead.  Because from a technical point of view, *you have no leg to stand on*.

Meanwhile, BCH is a centrally controlled project with *absolutely no economic support*.  You have less than a tenth of the hashing power of Bitcoin, with a majority coming from 2 people on Earth.  The only developers are no-name amateurs paid by Jihan Wu.  Your only economic backing comes from non-technical pathological liars like Roger Ver.  The entire project is nonsense.

That is how consensus to activate Segwit was gained - its a mistake to ignore it. 

The problem is you are just a developer, not a generalist a business person, an economic or a sociologist all you are is a code technician. You are not qualified, nor do you have the experience necessary to evaluate incentive designs or consensus rule changes for the bitcoin ecosystem.

"Simple maths is not that hard.

Pre NYA, Segwit had 30% support  (that's 70% decline in Core support from the previous updates) 

After the DCG  (the authority) convinced everyone to activate Segwit, it went to 95% 

BU had grown from 0 to 50% in the time it took BS/Core to get 30% Segwit adoption.

We can agree to see different things, but my facts are facts, and they are correct. 

The BCH fork happened for the very reason the DCG got involved. 

Look at who directs the DCG.  BCH didn't happen for the reasons you claim. 

It's water under the bridge, the LN teams can't deliver anyway. I've been involved in enough projects to see it has failed.  You just haven't acknowledged it yet. Ther was a reason Blockstream launched their unfinished code. It was an important milestone, many of there developers are moving on, project well done.

">&gt; But forcing high fees is more harmful.

>this is what you said. I understood it as you meaning someone (Core) 'forcing' high fees. 

Well that the BTC design now, small block are meant to create a fee market and the blockchain is used as a settlement layer.

Which is a radical change from the original design.

>&gt; And why fee market is good?

>&gt; That was my question that you seem to avoid replying.

>the fee market ensures that there are rewards to miners above and beyond the block reward. this is extremely important to prove NOW with respect to the future - as it is the economic incentive PROOF that a fee market can keep the economic game theory in place in the future. 

I mostly agree.

But I fail to see why the market fee should form against a 1MB block limit.

Allowing larger block would have allowed for the same fee revenue with lower individuals fees, allow more use case, more growth and therefore more decentralisation.

(ETH show that if a blockchain have more usefulness peolpe will run more nodes)

>&gt; And do you think high high fees has no harmful effect?

>yes, of course it does. The question is whether the harm is outweighed by the advantages. That is the discussion we should be having. 

That discussion has been forbidden for the mast three years.

The result is a Bitcoin split with BTC going for extremely large fees and BCH returning to the original design.

>&gt; Do you realize that your are arguing for mining centralisation.

>no i am not. don't tell me what i am and am not arguing for. You are interpreting my arguments one way - that may well be different to what i am trying to argue. 

**Your exact word:**

>>**&gt;small miners aren't going to keep the network secure from state impingement as effectively as large miners.**

If it is not arguing for mining centralisation what it is?

>&gt; Take an example,two miner, same equipment, same cost, same profitability but different network fees, one 5$ the other one 0.5$.

>this doesn't make sense. The network fees received are proportional to the network fee it costs to move the reward to an exchange to sell. 

?

Please explain that sentence make no sense to me.

>The rest of your example is not that clear - at all. please try and make it more coherent. 

The transactions fees to get your payout onchain will eat in your profitability.

And because you have to spend to cover your cost or use your rewards, tx fees are paid twice (transactions fee to get your rewards, transactions to use you rewards)

If you are a small miner (with 10% profitability) that collect $100 payout, your profit will be $100 minus $90 (cost) minus $5 (transactions fees to get you rewards onchain).

That leave the miner with $5 dollars.. too bad if he want to use his rewards, transactions fee are $5, he can’t. He made zero profit.

Now if a larger miner collect $1000 payout, his profit will be $1000 minus $900 (cost) minus $5 (tx fees).

*(pool fee included in cost)

This miner will have $95 and he will get another $5 fees if use his payout. 

He got $90, tx fees have eaten %10 of his business profit. He will be mostly unaffected by the transactions fees cost.

On top of that he will likely get an higher share of hash rate due to small miner not being competitive enough to participate.

This is in essence the mining centralisation force at play with high fees.";1;1;False;Ant-n;du0wcc0;To all Core shills saying that BCH hijacked BitCoin brand: BitCoin brand wouldn’t even exist without Jihan, Roger, Gavin and rest of early adopters who are now part of BCH community;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7vvmp6/to_all_core_shills_saying_that_bch_hijacked/
