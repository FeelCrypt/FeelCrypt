"> against allowing for gambling at the protocol level

At least this one point is being twisted by you.  From what I saw, he said that the oracles would have to be regulated, so its not really on the protocol level anyways.  We already have protocol betting like [chainbet protocol](https://github.com/fyookball/ChainBet/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md), and services like satoshidice that are enabled by bigger blocksizes and low fees.  Some protocol change options could be a danger when it comes to regulatory risks. And Calvin Ayre for example has been under [felony charges by federal prosecutors in the US](https://www.forbes.com/sites/nathanvardi/2017/07/14/former-online-gambling-billionaire-calvin-ayre-pleads-guilty-to-misdemeanor-charge/#e94e14053e37), so they are  probably aware of the dangers.  I also don't think its fair to say he wants to guide the direction of BCH, if that were the case maybe he would be dictator or something like that.
