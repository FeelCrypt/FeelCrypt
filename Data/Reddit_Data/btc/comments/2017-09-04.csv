And in about 2 moths I'll switch my Santander one to Nationwide's. Just like last year I switched my Barclays 4% 2 year rate to Santander's 1 year rate.

"Every interest rate is promotional, some are just more open about it than others. Rates are subject to change, no rate is guaranteed.

The simple fact is that you can get a savings account right now that will give you 5% interest for 14 months. It's possible that there will be no alternative in 14 months, but that's entirely academic.

> That's like saying credit cards don't charge interest because you can get a 0% APR intro rate.

No, it's like saying 0% APR intro rates don't exist because they are time limited.

Like I said, I've had 5% interest on my savings account for just under 5 years by switching accounts between banks. Equally I've had 0% interest on my credit card purchases by switching credit card providers regularly.

If you want to make the most of your money, you have to move it. That applies to savings accounts, stocks, funds, bonds etc. You find the best current rate, then move your money when it expires.

I don't see why you're making such a fuss over a time limit on the rate: of course you have to re-evaluate in a year's time: interest rates change, both at an account level, and at a national level. In 3 years time the base rate may be 6% and 5% on your savings would look rather foolish.";1;0;False;audigex;dmjodhb;As 20m more Tether are issued today, I think it's important for people to know that an unbacked Tether could be a big reason for the recent bitcoin price rise.

"Those are introductory promotion rates for balances up to Â£2,500. It reverts back to 1% after a year (which is also quite high for a savings account). It's a loss leader. Also that's for UK customers only which isn't what was being discussed in a thread about USD tethers, but whatever.

I'm assuming what would happen in this case is anyone holding USDT on exchange (or off exchange) is screwed, they've basically been wiped out of their holdings. On these USDT/BTC pairs (or any USDT/Other_Coin pair), all of a sudden there would be absolutely nobody willing to sell their coins for USDT, only bots that are oblivious to the event, and existing sell orders. Anyone lucky enough to place a market order with their now worthless Tethers right before the market is frozen will be fortunate (if this window even exists), anyone who misses this narrow window will be out of luck. If this window exists, it will cause an immediate price surge on these exchanges, and of course immediately after the markets are frozen this is likely to cause some major panic across all other platforms, people will seek refuge in actual fiat, not Tether on the platforms that offer actual fiat pairs. ;1;0;False;lechango;dmja2vg;As 20m more Tether are issued today, I think it's important for people to know that an unbacked Tether could be a big reason for the recent bitcoin price rise.
