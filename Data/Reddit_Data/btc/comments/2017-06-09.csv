Thanks for the warning.  I hope they come to their senses, and I hope you get your coins back.  They are offlimits for me, but really no different than most exchanges.  Obviously there may have been reasons, but most folks should NEVER keep this much bitcoin on an exchange.  Too many things can go terribly wrong.;1;0;False;Sixsignatory;dioums2;OKCoin is robbing me for 97 Bitcoins.;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6g8rd8/okcoin_is_robbing_me_for_97_bitcoins/
