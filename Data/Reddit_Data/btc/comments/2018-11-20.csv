Ok. Well, I think there could exist some 100% benevolent and positive entities, in which case selective censorship might be helpful for everyone. That could be possible. However, since that is basically impossible to guarantee, it is too great of a weapon to hand over to someone who isn't 100% good, that it is best to practice no-censorship than risk that power falling into the wrong hands. Since there is no way to do that, abolish censorship. Makes sense to me. I certainly see your logic but I don't think invoking censorship is bad for its own sake, I think it is bad because of the possible harm from misuse, and thus, not good to have a system that can allow said misuse (assuming there is a non-0 chance of a bad actor having power, which he remarks is certainly not non-0!);1;1;False;whuttheeperson;ea2gjjs;This tweet aged well;9yki64;https://i.redd.it/gh1iqx5wicz11.jpg

"> I think there could exist some 100% benevolent and positive entities, in which case selective censorship might be helpful for everyone.

This is the fundamental error in your reasoning. Politics is a space with thousands of different philosophies and orientations, as well as many different solutions to extremely varied and highly complex problems. Talking about ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"" is a completely reductionist and dangerous way of thinking about governance. It's an iterative process often times with many different equally valid answers to problems, and as such, granting the power of censorship to any entity is not only dangerous, it is also wrong.

What Vitalik is saying is that as long as HE or HIS political faction is in power (I assume he considers himself one of the 'good guys'), he percieves censorship to be great and moral.
