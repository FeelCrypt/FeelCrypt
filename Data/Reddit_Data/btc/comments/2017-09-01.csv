As just some early information, the raw amount of censorship going on is actually a little lower than we expected.  So props to the mods there.

But the types of censorship going on is actually worse than we thought.  When it comes to comments, there appears to be a **lot** more of people being censored for the arguments and facts they are presenting, not for ""trolling"" or being an asshole / bad behavior.

and then you said this:

> I just listened to a podcast with Nick Szabo and he and Naval Ravikant really misrepresented a few things.

Nick invented the blockchain and discussed creating a currency called ""bit gold"" based on it.  Bitcoin is just an implementation of Nick Szabo's vision.  Satoshi had no independent vision.  The only thing that Satoshi added was how to distribute the coins initially (as a subsidy to the miners).  Of course that was probably Nick's idea too, because Nick Szabo is almost certainly Satoshi Nakamoto.

Nice list of questions. Look forward to the answers.

> As I understand it (please correct me if I'm wrong) the best thing about sidechains IS NOT that it will help with scaling, it's that it will help with innovation. Sidechains are being railed here, however another purpose to sidechains is to essentially create a type of ""test"" environment where experiements can take place. I could be totally wrong here though...

It will not help with scaling, but it will reduce, greatly the need for scaling. It intends to move transactions for things like (urgh) buying a coffee onto side chains that then sum up all transactions for the hour/day/week/month into a single transaction on the Bitcoin chain.

And yes, because it is removed from the main chain it doesn't affect it. The main chain does not even know it exists. You could completely break your side chain app and everything associated with it and not affect the integrity of the Bitcoin blockchain itself. 

...as far as I understand.

">The success of BCH seems to be pinned on 2 things. 1) the world ""realizes"" something 2) something goes wrong for Bitcoin core.

Nobody needs to ""realize"" anything, nor does anything (further) need to go wrong with BTC for BCH to succeed. Fast, cheap, reliable transactions are an essential part of bitcoin's (and more generally, cryptocurrency's) long term value proposition. There is no good technical reason to limit transaction throughput artificially ala Core, so it is reasonable to conclude that the product which maintains said value proposition will overtake a competitor which does not. 

This is not a betamax vs. VHS situation. Betamax was *marginally* superior to VHS in terms of video quality, but Bitcoin Cash is *substantially* superior to Bitcoin where it counts: transaction friction. Imagine if VHS required a ""subscription plan"" just to play tapes that you already owned, while betamax did not, thus subverting a core value proposition for the consumer. Betamax would have crushed VHS in that case.    ";3;1;False;KoKansei;dmexqr5;New ad running on /r/Bitcoin;http://i.imgur.com/NKgRRqU.png

"So i'm new to this sub and it's really hard to find any objective information regarding this coin.  It's all rhetoric and hate and conspiracy theory.     Now, I agree with a few things through research I've done on my own.  Here's what I've found:

1. ""Satoshi's vision"" is in fact violated by where bitcoin core is going, YET no one seems to care.   Everyone is mostly treating it as how americans treat the constitution - i.e. Ammendments and such where needed, and it's about the ""Spirit"" of it all.

2.  I just listened to a podcast with Nick Szabo and he and Naval Ravikant really misrepresented a few things.   When asked about block size Nick insisted that people have no business talking about it and should just leave it to the engineers to figure out.   Naval and Nick both misrepresented the block size by saying it isn't needed to increase transactions and the limit to the block size is important to not flood the network as well as to not make it so that eventually the blocks are so big that only a few machines are capable of mining them - they argue it's to maintain decentralization.    This IMO is an outright misrepresentation to people.  And they were laughing and highly dismissive of the idea of bigger blocks.   They they also expressed their annoyance that ""everyone"" had bitcoin and said it should really be for large transactions.   This annoyed me.  They're ""dream"" is that only a select few can use bitcoin?  assholes.   they also talked about how the 10 min blocks were essential to the system in order to give validity to the amount of work done to find a block.   This is horseshit - it's arbitrary and used as consensus solve so that the consensus can then ACCEPT the block using the same criteria.  they also talked about how all those misguided people on the outside talking about how much energy blocks take don't know what they are saying - more horseshit, it's estimated right now that finding and accepting 1 block takes the equivalent power of powering 1 american household for 1.5 days.   This bothered me as I had a lot of respect for both of these people, and they really were misguiding people.   

3.  I do understand that Bitcoin Cash is the ""original vision"" but I guess I would say - so what?   I'm just wondering if people are picking any reason at all to rebel against any sort of removal of decentralization and their idealism is getting in the way of reality.   I don't really want to allign with zealots who though right, aren't willing to accept reality.  That is, at times, what BTC seems like.  

4.  Miners are absolutely controlling all of this and all of BCH schenanigans, and it makes everything very unstable - they all profit we all suffer.  It's hard to get behind something that seems to be entirely controlled by a CENTRALIZED SYSTEM such as...4 chinese entities?   They have yet to show me that they have any loyalty and it seems that everyone on here keeps their fingers crossed hoping.  

5.  The success of BCH seems to be pinned on 2 things.   1) the world ""realizes"" something  2) something goes wrong for Bitcoin core.     I've found in real life these to be really horrible things to base any decision on.   A) - the world will never realize something and you'll realize no one cares but you  B) HOPE IS NOT A PLAN.

6.  The Bitcoin core community is very hard at work pushing their agenda.  I don't like this, but I'm an investor and what I like or dislike doesn't change what is.   I've said it before, there is the possibility that bitcoin cash is the betamax of cryptocurrency.  Superior in nearly every way, and no one really cared because VHS was EVERYWHERE.    I've found people don't give a damn about better, they just want ""good enough"".   I've found IT technical people however hang their hat on the idea that ""its flawed can't they see that??!?""  while the rest of the population shrugs its shoulders and says, yeah...but..who cares cause it's good enough. 

7.  Transaction fees are brought up quite often about why BCH is better.  I never doubted that BCH is better, it is.  my point about transaction fees is and has been, is the delta of fee difference worth a whole new paradigm to people in the world?  Right now, it sure seems like that answer is no.

8.  People are incredibly illogical.   They trust known brands, they trust what their favorite media tells them to trust.   This brings us to the illogic of ""hey if this is so much better even right now, and things cost so much more in bitcoin RIGHT NOW, then...why is the price of bitcoin skyrocketing?  that just doesn't make sense!""     Right.  It doesn't, but the world seldom makes sense.

9.  As I understand it (please correct me if I'm wrong) the best thing about sidechains IS NOT that it will help with scaling, it's that it will help with innovation.   Sidechains are being railed here, however another purpose to sidechains is to essentially create a type of ""test"" environment where experiements can take place.  I could be totally wrong here though...

10.   So why am I here?  because I'm one of the few that made a bad trade and got in when it was over 750 USD and now I've lost some stupid amount of opportunity money and I need it to go back up so I can recoup some of my losses.   

11.  After reading more about Bitcoin cash, I really think it's the ""right"" way.  It's the correct way, but what I think and what this sub thinks is irrelevant to what the market thinks.   I really want to be wrong about this though.   

12.  Bitcoin cash is a horrible name, sure it has ""bitcoin"" in it, but you'll never be able to explain to a non techie that it's ""the real bitcoin"" and right now the name just gives it a cheap copy type feel like it's glomming onto the ""real bitcoin"".   It's also clunkier than just ""bitcoin"".   from a marketing perspective it's a terrible name.  

13.  bitcoin core are horrible people, or more to the point business centric, specifically to the finacial type sector.  but this reminds me a bit of the Linux / windows debate.     Linux would never win, never, not ever.   And regardless of it being ""better"", it's never stopped microsoft from putting out ""good enough"" operating systems year after year, and it's never stopped the majority of people from buying it.   Shitty people OFTEN get ahead in the world, it sucks but it's how it goes.   You think Lyft was talking about how much of a dick Travis was while he was kicking their ass all over the playing field?  YES, THEY WERE.   did it stop travis at all? NOPE.   did people still use travis' service knowing fully well he's a total prick? YES.     Now, travis in the end loses (except for his billions of dollars...) but, no one is flooding back to lyft saying ""I'm sorry lyft we all should have known!!""    The world doesn't function like this, it does not care.   Waiting around for the world to come back is a bit pathetic.   Again, HOPE ISN'T A PLAN.

14.  I may be dismissed as a shill, a troll, whatever - I'm not, but I'm sure it will still be used on me.   What I would love to see is a counterpoint to everything I just brought up.   Someone with some actual strong theories give me more than just religion-of-the-coin spiel.    Again, I state, I've got a lot of money locked up in BCH right now, so I want nothing more than it to succeed!  But I need more than fingers crossed and ""someday they'll realize it"" positions.
