"That makes all the sense right there.  What I don’t understand is, all that hashrate for security on the main chain, but LN nodes are secure too because? How does an underlying chain secure a side chain?   

LN nodes will function as payment routing hubs with hot wallets, and we must maintain a balance for commerce to function. 

Can we add funds to LN nodes? How the f is this supposed to work. It’s really confusing to the average business owner who wants to accept and use bitcoin / bitcoin cash. Inter-community fighting is the ultimate drawback.

you still didn't refute this statement. will you acknowledge that it is correct?

security is proportional to hashrate. if you don't agree - we have a fundamental disagreement about *what blockchain security is*.

this is wishful thinking.

> difficulty adjustment would compensate to make it easier to mine for remaining miners

yeah, which will lower the security of the blockchain and therefore reduce the value of it.

> network has already been proven to handle gigablocks

no it hasn't. generating bunch of large blocks in small low-saturation network is *not* proving that the system is sustainable in the wild, will withstand attacks and/or will not become centralized over time.

> do you think Visa or MC run off Rasperry Pis

bitcoin was created to be different from Visa or MC. it was created with simple goal in mind - participation should not be cost-prohibitive:

> What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party.

""any two willing parties ... without the need for a trusted third party"". if full node can't run on commodity hardware you're forced to trust a third party.

> 1 Sat per standard size 250 Byte transaction

this is not a thing, 1/Sat is *per byte* not per transaction and guess what, if you design your system to target specific fee to make it affordable for poorest segments of the population - spammers will just fill that space with their junk *and ""the unbanked"" will still have to pay higher fee*.

so i ask you again - what is the difference between your supposed ""malformed blocks"" that satoshi was trying to protect bitcoin from and the 250 bytes of transaction data? what is it in those malformed blocks and how do we tell it apart from valid transactions? you *have to* have a clear answer to this if you're holding such strong views about blockchain spam.

> Some people live off less than $1 a day. How is BTC with its $1 - $40 fees going to help poor countries or bank the unbanked?

this is exactly the problem with spammers - they can afford to fill the blockchain, spending way more than ""the unbanked"". if you go for unlimited size blocks - this will lead to unstable and/or centralized network.

the solution is to protect the chain by making economically non-viable uses of it expensive through fees but also provide second layer solutions that can scale up independent of the chain but still retaining the security properties. it's mind boggling that anybody would oppose this just because it's a development from the ""wrong camp"".";1;0;False;keymone;dxojbsx;The Bitcoin community is so far gone...;https://i.redd.it/6ql1ch8o0vs01.jpg

"> nobody is setting transaction fees. 

The wallets set the minimum and standard fees e.g. bitcoin.com wallet does 1 Sat/B. However it's currently up to the individual miners on what minimum fee they will accept to include a transaction in a block. With plenty of block space there's no reason to not include any transactions. Any miner not accepting a transaction loses the fee to any miner who will include it. That's the incentive to include as many as possible. High fees on Segwitcoin kill commerce, microtransactions and a lot of use cases. This is why Bitcoin has been losing considerable market share to altcoins the past few years.

> no, security doesn't stay ""relatively the same"". miners dropping out means hasrate going down means security (cost of attack) going down.

Yes it does because you need to think about why the miners might drop off. In which case a halving might have recently happened and the relative fiat price hasn't risen to a level that is sustainable to maintain profitability yet. Miners can of course rejoin at any time if it does become profitable. If miners drop off the difficulty adjusts downward and the other miners remain profitable. When you talk about ""security"" that's irrelevant because it will remain relatively the same security if any attacking miner can't affordably attack the network. Hash rate leaves due to no profitability, an attacker will find it just as unprofitable to attack at the same time.

> in less than two years reward will be 6BTC. four years from that - 3BTC. before 2030 reward will be 1.5BTC. sure, some of the loss will be offset by price increase, but low rewards are not decades away. asset depreciation is a thing, what do you think is a profitable lifetime of a mining rig?

At each of these halvings there is likely to be a large uptick in fiat price to compensate because there's less coins being mined, hence less inflation and hence less coins available for selling in the market. Even if 95% of the miners left in 10 years time the network would keep running as the difficulty adjustment would compensate to make it easier to mine for remaining miners. They might find with 1 BCH per block and a price of $100,000 per BCH it's still profitable to mine on their cheap solar powered mining rigs. When the block reward completely runs out then the network would rely on transaction fees from millions of transactions per block.

> and this is the critical point. network efficiency, stability and participation cost all depend on how much volume is allowed. block size was limited precisely because the danger of overwhelming the network with spam, what makes you think this danger is behind us?

The network has already been proven to handle gigablocks with nodes just needing a medium sized server. I ask you, do you think Visa or MC run off Rasperry Pis? No they have datacenters full of servers and that's just for one small country. I've worked designing the server/network infrastructure for banks. Core's idea of everything needing to run off a Rasperry Pi is so ridiculous.

Transactions that pay a minimum fee e.g. 1 Sat per standard size 250 Byte transaction are not spam. Forcing users from poor countries to pay more than a cent for a transaction is daylight robbery.

"Not sure why you’re asking that when we’re talking about cash for a wire, not settlement on trades. $1mil in cash being wired to an outside account will have no margin, no charge, nothing.

We aren’t going to use margin on wires because we plan ahead and our clients aren’t calling up saying “we need $1mil immediately.” We talk and plan ahead to have cash liquid when needed. Even clients that are in hedges that need a quarter to settle know it’s not happening.

You specifically said “no way could you do it internationally for less than $100” which is pure bullshit.";3;1;False;Balrogz14;dxnq0ay;The Bitcoin community is so far gone...;https://i.redd.it/6ql1ch8o0vs01.jpg
"Here is another one of my pet peeves .... all this talk about ""blockchains"" 


99% of everybody on the planet using the blockchain buzzword have no idea when a blockchain is a solution and when it's  not. And also when a blockchain can work and why it works. 

For instance, private blockchains are retarded because if you are going to control who has acces to your blockchain or not ... then why use a blockchain at all? Blockchains are only a solution for providing a system that works in a environment where you can't trust the other participants. 

And the main reason why Bitcoin works is not really a technical one but an economic one. Bitcoin was designed to that the incentive to cooperate within the network are of magnitude higher then the incentives to try to break the rules. 

So any blockchain system that does not have these incentives ... well they are not a blockchain! At least not in the way Bitcoin is.

And so to separate blockchain from Bitcoin is deceitful. 

Having a database stored in a distributed way is not a new invention and so you can't call that a blockchain.  Having a timestamp server is not a new invention and so you can't just call any chain of hashes a blockchain.

Satoshi invented a mechanism, and the totality of that mechanism was called Bitcoin. And the data structure we call a blockchain. 


If you take elements away from that mechanism it will stop working. And if you take elements away from that mechanism and create a totally different mechanism that might work ... then you can't call it a blockchain ...... 


Where people go wrong is that they have no idea what Satoshi was trying to solve. And so when people call something that does not solve Satoshi his problems, Bitcoin ... well that's not fair! Go come up with your own name!

BTC is totally incapable of that, LN is a BTC backed offchain solution that can do it, but on-chain solutions like BCH and Nano are simpler, and in Nano's case, cheaper and faster too. The only argument is about storage of every transaction on the baselayer, that is a problem for BCH, and could be a security problem for LN if it fails as it doesn't even have a blockchain in itself...
