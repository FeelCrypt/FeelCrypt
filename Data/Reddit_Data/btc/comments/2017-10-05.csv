Wait, since block values decrease by half every 4 years, and mining difficulty is increasing (and also as more people use Bitcoin) doesn't that mean in a few years, when miners don't earn much from mining, won't they either start charging much higher transaction fees or stop mining? If they're making less and less then what will be their incentive to keep mining in 20 years other than really high transaction fees? ;1;1;False;Zaquarius_Alfonzo;dnyi01b;This community is a nightmare for new users;6t1ttt;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6t1ttt/this_community_is_a_nightmare_for_new_users/
"Transaction speed depends on how many transactions are waiting in line to get through the bottleneck. Unlike a ""fair"" line, you can waive a $5 bill in the air to get bumped to the front. Speeding things up for everyone requires a change in the way the system works, like making the line wider (increasing the block size).

"Miners don't set fees, so that's the nice part. Users tack fees on as an extra ""tip"" to incentivize the miner to include their transaction in the next block solved.

And yes, eventually the reward for a solved block will fall below the cost in electricity it takes to solve the block. By that point, a larger user base and MANY more transactions per block will incentivize miners to keep the network going. At least that's the plan.

Also we have these things called difficulty adjustments that are built into Bitcoin Cash.

Remember that number from the video, the one that had to start with a certain number of zeroes? How many zeroes affects how long it takes to guess and check before finding the right SHA-256 hash.

You're missing the reason Bitcoin's creator installed the 1mb block limit in the first place. When transactions were nearly free, someone could spam tons of bogus transactions and forever clog up the blockchain with gigabytes of trash data. While a similar attack would be extremely expensive under today's fee market, larger blocks will bring down fees and reduce transaction times.

"#Small block

Small-block logic goes that we should scale slow and without hard-fork methods such as block size increases. It favors second-layer technology that accelerates transactions while removing the signature data from each block. If you want to know how important the signature data is to each transaction, or even WHAT that is, watch [this short 25-minute video](https://youtu.be/bBC-nXj3Ng4). And yes, I'm sorry, 25 minutes is short when it comes to Bitcoin =[

The pros of this strategy are largely in the realm of stabilization. Right now the large-block fork of Bitcoin, called Bitcoin Cash, has a block size EIGHT times the size of the BTC chain. Recently they've been mining mostly-empty blocks to the tune of 50 per hour. It's too fast, rewarding miners for processing blocks that contain zero transactions. This is the scaling problem the small-blockers warned us about.

Meanwhile, the BTC chain is chugging along business as usual. Although, that means high confirmation times and ridiculous fees. Imagine if you had to wait 45 minutes for your Visa to clear so you could go home with tonight's six pack, and the vendor got charged $1.64 just to take your payment. That's where Bitcoin is as ""money"" right now.

#big block

The problem with second-layer solutions is the bottleneck at the on-ramp. If we really want Bitcoin to be used worldwide as a currency free from centralized control, we need it to be readily accessible by even those with rudimentary third-world tech. We're talking people who live of seven dollars a day at the bottom line. The rich and poor alike should have equal access to this revolution in how we think about wealth.

But to have everyone using this improved second layer, we have to get them onto the first layer with just one transaction.

Full Segwit theoretical capacity (on-chain) is 3.7 transactions per second, from what I've researched. Anyone feel free to correct my math. At 3.7 transactions a second, we can only get the entire world population on a second layer after 60 years. And that's ONLY assuming we get everyone on the planet on the main blockhain as fast as possible, 3.7 people per second.

The block size HAS to increase to accommodate the world population, to allow for fast confirmation times, and to facilitate cheap transfer rates. How far this philosophy goes as Bitcoin grows has been a hotly-debated subject.";1;1;False;anthson;dnxl4fk;This community is a nightmare for new users;6t1ttt;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6t1ttt/this_community_is_a_nightmare_for_new_users/

"> hard-fork methods (what)

Increasing the block size requires a hard fork, which means the nodes upgrading to the new block size have to fork away from those who stay behind. A hard fork is how we split into Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash several weeks back.

> second-layer technology

Let's say we have four transactions on our main blockchain. A gives B $20. B gives C $20. C gives D $20. D gives F $20. An oversimplified definition of second-layer tech would be a system that takes all five transactions and only runs one – A gives F $20 – on the main blockchain.

> (what is mining, what are blocks, and why are they mostly empty?)

Watch that short video. It's quite entertaining and explains things a lot better and quicker than I can!

> (I'm guessing this is what you mean when you say empty, but what does this mean?)

Again, the video. But basically every miner races to find a ""magic number"" that starts with a certain number of zeros so they can validate a block, which is a group of transactions. If blocks are getting validated quicker than transactions are being requested, miners are getting rewarded for lending the network processing power it doesn't need.

> What are layers, and why do we have to get them on the first in one transaction

The main blockchain IS Bitcoin – a history of transactions going back to the very first. Anything on top of it is a second layer. In order to get to layer two, you have to have a Bitcoin wallet. That's only possible, as I understand it, through the main Blockchain and is limited to 3.7 transactions per second. I'm not super educated in this area, though, so my understanding of the ""why"" may be a bit off.

> Full Segwit theoretical capacity (on-chain)

Segwit is a piece of software that altered the way Bitcoin worked by stripping the signature witness data from each transaction and segregating it. Hence the name segregated witness, or Segwit. Remember how I said the block size was fixed at 1mb, limiting the number of transactions Bitcoin can process? Well Segwit theoretically allows more transactions to fit into 1mb, and it does that by making them smaller through segregating that signature data. This is an on-chain scaling solution proposed by small-blockers, but it requires everyone to be using Segwit wallets in order to function at max capacity.

> 3.7 transactions per second, (is that a lot? What does that mean?)

No, it's not a lot. It causes congestion, which leads to longer confirmation times and higher fees. It Bitcoin's early days, the user base was small enough that this wasn't a problem. Since we mined our first full 1mb block, though, transactions have only been getting slower and fees have climbed from pennies to dollars.

For sure, to date, there's been a great uptake of support for Bitcoin Cash, and that's wonderful, but will take time to convert into user adoption.

"I think perhaps it takes too long to kick in, and when it does, it does too much; but it's only too much when the profitability is close to the other chain. Might work better if it starts correcting much sooner, but does so in a much more gradual manner, while still producing the same total amount of change over the same period of time as the original EDA if conditions don't change. And maybe it would be better if it was based on time instead of block count, and symmetrical instead of just downward.

The chain has too little hashrate proportional to how many miners are attracted when the profitability crosses the parity line, and so the difficulty adjustment corrects more than it should when it brings the chain above the parity line; but the adjustment size is reasonable when the parity line isn't crossed.";1;0;False;TiagoTiagoT;dnx3dnp;I think we need an EDA fix before the Nov hardfork;7474tv;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7474tv/i_think_we_need_an_eda_fix_before_the_nov_hardfork/

"This is what they should have done in regards to ""EDA"": Along with the fork occurring, a one time difficulty decrease should have gone in effect that lowers the difficulty value by a percentage derived from an estimation of hashpower that will appear on the BCH chain. For instance, if it was estimated that 25% of miners will leave BTC and start mining BCH, then the BCH difficulty value should have dropped by 75% with *no other modifications*. No changes to the actual algorithm is needed, just a change to the actual value to correspond to the amount of hashpower they actually have. As long as the estimation is in the right ballpark, it would have been enough to allow the chain to survive.

"They need to make it a html5 game where the player either tries to get more coins over the same amount of time, or crash the chain, by manipulating the ""hashrate""; and collect statistics and stuff to see if anyone figures out a strategy to break the algorithm.

Of course, it needs to include both chains in the simulation, and several price change scenarios.

One possible way of control for both hashrate power and distribution between chains, would be to use the mouse, with the vertical position controlling the total hashrate, and the horizontal position controlling the distribution between chains (with the cursor at the middle of the screen, the hashrate would be distributed 50/50 between the chains).

From a theoretical point of view, if all miners act rationally, can switch chain instantly, and only prioritize short-term profit, there won't be a single block mined on the BCH chain as long as it's more profitable to mine BTC.  That's the reason why the current EDA algorithm adjusts the difficulty even if no blocks are mined.  I think that's a feature it's important to keep.;1;1;False;tobixen;dnxlxee;I think we need an EDA fix before the Nov hardfork;7474tv;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7474tv/i_think_we_need_an_eda_fix_before_the_nov_hardfork/

Miners chase profit so hard that they readily abandon Core. You're making my point. Oscillations are a problem of EDA. Ideology is clearly not required to attract miners, it is required to keep stability under the current algorithm.

Ideology is not required to attract miners. It is temporarily beneficial if an ideological miner dampens the effect of clumsy algorithm.

"Well I agree that's too rapid and frankly I don't think there should be any EDAs and that would lead to Bitcoin Cash just dying off. 

But the objective of Bitcoin Cash it would appear is to not care for what miners think as to weather or not it should exist. As such it needs a means of rapid difficulty reduction to achieve this goal. The only way to the counter act rapid hashrate increase is to make it so difficulty adjusts up just as quickly as it can go down. This way BCH gets to acheive it's objective of never die off regardless of POW and it doesn't get artificially fast block times as a result of difficulty going up as slow as initially intended by Bitcoin.

"I said...

Then you said...

>Then you fundamentally fail to understand why Bitcoin works. The entire point is that everyone is supposed to be greedy. 

Did I not just say we operate under the assumption that miners are greedy? So what am I failing to understand?

The part where we differ is..

>[miners] will act in the best interests of Bitcoin (which is also in the interests of the users). Miner's success is directly correlated to Bitcoin's.

This is false. Miners will act in their own best interests. In your ideal situation their interests align with the users and the network as a whole, but as BCH has shown us, that isn't necessarily true. We have to assume the miners will act in their own best interest, full stop. The question then is, when do their interests depart from being the same as mine and yours? Well, competing chains that can be mined with the same hardware, where one has a difficulty adjustment they can game for profit is one example as we've seen. Clearly their interest haven't aligned with the users of BCH, otherwise this thread wouldn't exist, nor have they aligned with the users of BTC.

So yes, miners are greedy, but relying on their greed to always align with your/Bitcoin's interests is where *you* seem to fundamentally fail to understand those of us who are critical of the idea that miners = bitcoin.";1;0;False;rslax;dnx35cm;I think we need an EDA fix before the Nov hardfork;7474tv;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7474tv/i_think_we_need_an_eda_fix_before_the_nov_hardfork/

"> [M]iners are greedy and will do what is in their best interest, not necessarily what is in the best interest of users.

This is how the game theory behind Bitcoin works. Satoshi Nakomoto realized that miners could not be trusted to act in the best interests of users. That's why he designed a system that relies only on miners acting in their own interest.

The benefit to users is a byproduct of the game theory underlying Bitcoin. There is no assumption anywhere in the original paper that users' ""best"" interests are served, for any reasonable definition of ""best"".
