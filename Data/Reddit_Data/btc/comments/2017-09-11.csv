"> Mods do choose who gets to speak and who doesn't. The way to do that is by defining this ""special people"" and ""special list"" etc.

Nope, they're essentially saying that ""we don't use this feature at all, except is some very special cases"". That means the whitelist is *not* being used as a way to suppress or censor the masses. The ""suppression"" (if that's what you'd call it) is being done, indirectly, by the community in a decentralized way (one person, one vote) and if you end up saying stupid things, reddit will take care of the rest. Mods have nothing to do with this process (apart from telling you that this sub's policy is that no one is being added to reddit's whitelist feature due to being throttled).

> Does it matter if it's childish or not?

It matters to me, but it doesn't matter for deciding whether they're suppressing you or not.

> Well, it's pretty much word-by-word if you replace ""worthy"" to ""prominent"".

It would have been, but the words ""worthy"" and ""prominent"" means to completely different things. Using first word would've made the mods seem childing and patronizing, while using the second word makes them seem like they're just explaining the rules of the sub to you (as they should).

> You have the same abilities as people in the whitelist.

Yes, but that's due to taking responsibility for *my own* actions and choices, not due to the moderators' actions or choices. You seem to have something to learn, there.

> Only way to make you lose those abilities (and not being in the whitelist) is to get your subreddit karma below zero. It's easy: just say stuff that's not in line with the agenda.

Even easier: Trolling and being dogmatic. What's difficult, though, is constructive criticism, which means getting your point across without being a douche.

Based on this conversation I don't think it's unreasonable to assume that you still have *something* to learn in that department.

> Again, I wouldn't mind if they either restricted everyone or unrestricted everyone.

That's what they're doing - at least as far as regular users are concerned. If some devs or whatnot are on a special list, that doesn't really affect the sub overall.

No!

>they're essentially saying that ""we don't use this feature at all, except is some very special cases""

It's an excuse. What if this ""special feature"" was e.g. banning functionality? Then they'd be excused to ban whoever they want for whatever they want because of ""special case"" treatment. I am not saying they shouldn't do whatever they want. I am calling out their lies re: policy & suppression.

>That means the whitelist is not being used as a way to suppress or censor the masses.

It's up to the mods to use it or not use it. Same as with banning functionality. You can use both to suppress speech. I agree it's not suppressing masses, it's only suppressing picked individuals.

>The ""suppression"" (if that's what you'd call it) is being done, indirectly, by the community in a decentralized way (one person, one vote) and if you end up saying stupid things, reddit will take care of the rest. 

That's dream world you're talking about. People do not get downvoted here for saying stupid things. People get downvoted when they go against the r/btc agenda, and by bots (evidenced a long time ago, Google it up.) Go post something positive about Bitcoin Core, Blockstream, r/Bitcoin, Theymos, Bitcointalk etc. You'll be downvoted a ton. That's not how this ""decentralized one person one vote, downvote stupid comments"" thing was meant to work, right? So let's drop that illusion it's even REMOTELY working like it's supposed, especially in this very polarized subreddit where only one side is allowed, other side downvoted & suppressed as a result.

>Mods have nothing to do with this process (apart from telling you that this sub's policy is that no one is being added to reddit's whitelist feature due to being throttled).

They acknowledge it's suppressing. They unsuppress some people but choose to not unsuppress some. It's *their* action, not Reddits. It's *all* about them subreddit mods in this process.

>It would have been, but the words ""worthy"" and ""prominent"" means to completely different things. Using first word would've made the mods seem childing and patronizing, while using the second word makes them seem like they're just explaining the rules of the sub to you (as they should).

These two sentences have the same message after all, no matter if the word used is ""worthy"" or ""prominent"". I don't care about tone changes when we're talking about the content of the message. Btw, they banned me when I said that they're the ones choosing who they find as ""prominent"" (or ""worthy"") so it's 100% up to them to choose who's ""special"" and who's not. Funny thing that when they couldn't respond to that, they banned me.

>Yes, but that's due to taking responsibility for my own actions and choices, not due to the moderators' actions or choices. You seem to have something to learn, there.

When did it become your action/choice to receive downvotes? Do you mean that I should post aligning the agenda to not be suppressed? Lol.

>Even easier: Trolling and being dogmatic. What's difficult, though, is constructive criticism, which means getting your point across without being a douche.

I do not troll. It's known that here in r/btc one gets downvoted when he doesn't speak aligning the agenda. You can read my and many others post history to find this out if it interests you.

You're refusing to understand what I tell you. There's no need to derail this conversation all the time. The point is: Mods do choose who gets to speak and who doesn't. All this ""what is whitelist"" or ""was it worthy or prominent"" is just offtopic in that matter. I think there's not much to discuss when you're dodging my arguments all the time.
