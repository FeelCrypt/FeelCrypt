"OP, for some reason I got -5 or -6 on my comment, I am reposting this so you are made aware of the past CEX.io scams. 

Here was my comment.

cex.io has always scammed

Back when they sold hashing power for mining they released a futures market on hashing ppwer, which completly tanked hashing power price per ghz by over 50% within 12 hours and more than 90% over a few days. So what happened is that EVERYONE who bought hashing power and was cloud mining with CEX got completely f'ed and lost big time. There were people who don't pay attention every day to their cloud mining and they logged in days later to find they lost 90% due to the release of mining futures.

They gave no notice to this happening. People collectively lost hundreds of thousands of bitcoins due to this, CEX was a pretty big mining operation. Fast forward to today and they reopen and rebrand as an exchange and nobody is the wiser apparently.

i lost 40% of 9 btc back then in one day due to their futures bullshit. i got out same day luckily. They basically did it because something with not having the mining power/making their own money back for themselves(because it caused the price per GHZ to crash 90% and everyone sold out of their GHZ back to them). Then they made a killing on the mining futures they released becuase the futures were directly betting against hashing power(kind of like shorting hashing power per ghz price).

Did they ever get prosecuted for that bullshitery? anyone know? As far as I am aware nothing ever happened to them and not many people talked about it for some reason.

To add to that, the CEO admitted they didn't even have mining hardware tnat that it was 3rd party the whole time, AND they admitted they turned of people's mining and didn't turn it back on(you had to manually do it).

https://cointelegraph.com/news/interview-with-cexios-jeffrey-smith-on-why-they-paused-mining-and-the-future-of-the-industry



""Smith tells me that CEX has no hardware of their own, and everything traded on their exchange occurs through third-party hardware companies that have chosen to remain nameless. That isn't so much of a revelation as much as it is a fact that went unnoticed by many. The knowledge likely won’t quiet those who are complaining about a perceived lack of transparency. The website’s cloud mining page says nothing about hardware being held by third parties.

Really, nothing has changed for end users. If you own GHS, you can simply turn it back on and continue using the hashing power as you were before. People may feel as though CEX is looking to profit off those who don't bother to turn their GHS back on, but for the individual who is fearful that CEX is trying to get one up on them, the solution is to simply to turn it back on.""";122;1;False;TruthForce;dss0j3v;Update on my missing USD 34,000 with CEX.io;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7qsndd/update_on_my_missing_usd_34000_with_cexio/

Hard to say especially if you are looking for the same features as Cex.io had alts & margin trading. The only thing that comes close is Kraken but they've been having technical problems on their platform which I'm not sure if they have fixed yet. I personally use Bitstamp cause I think they are the safest being the oldest & most established with yearly audits. But Gemini is good as well I hear with low trading fees. I don't do margin trading so for me Bistamp has been enough.

Late credit card withdrawals

Misteriously dissappearings of my card details from the withdrawal page

11k$ SEPA Transfer Pending for 2 weeks

Misterious declines of already confirmed credit card when trying to re-add it ...

And plenty more. I followed their instructions, got automated copy paste messages, read them, followed the new instructions, didn't work, replyed patiently and eventually a human signed email came with instructions that when followed got my problem solved in 24 hours usually.

How can I get this money out of CEX.IO? They require that I wait another 30 days before resubmitting a verification request, and they haven't even specified what caused my application to be rejected.

I'm presuming I can look to buy crypto, move it to another exchange, and withdraw through that exchange.

no, it's not, that wouldn't make any sense

Malleability is fixed in bitcoin (the real bitcoin) and RBF is not an issue AT ALL. (It's an optional feature, and the transactions is signed as ""non final"", btw, you can't change the reciver address, like is saying in BCH website)

so, it looks like that you have read about RBF in BCH sites, which are clearly lying about RBF

In any case, saying that RBF is an issue clearly show that you DON'T know how it work, nor what it is

>90 percent txs that refuse to use the Segwit BS

Not exactly. They're not refusing, that would be idiot, because they would pay 4x more for a transaction, the segwit on the core wallet was not launched yet, that's why they're not using segwit already";1;1;False;_GCastilho_;dss9764;One advice for Coinbase;https://i.redd.it/xl6efkjgcu901.jpg

Also there does not seem to be a definitive answer on whether and how much induced demand impacts capacity expansions. See [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_demand#Studies) with
>A comparison of congestion data from 1982 to 2011 by the Texas A&M Transportation Institute clearly demonstrated that additional roadways reduced the rate of congestion increase. When increases in road capacity were matched to the increase demand, growth in congestion was found to be much lower.

>On the other hand, one study by Robert Cervero, a professor of City and Regional Planning at the University of California, Berkeley, found that ""over a six- to eight-year period following freeway expansion, around twenty percent of added capacity is 'preserved,' and around eighty percent gets absorbed or depleted. Half of this absorption is due to external factors, like growing population and income. The other half is due to induced-demand effects, mostly higher speeds but also increased building activities. 

So, do you mind explaining to me if there are examples that could be comparable to cryptocurrency or why transportation and vending machines are relevant to the block size discussion?";2;1;False;vonludi;dsr5ovh;"Peer-reviewed Bitcoin study finds ""no sound, quantitative arguments against maximizing block size""";http://hackingdistributed.com/2018/01/15/decentralization-bitcoin-ethereum/

"As compelling as your argument sounds on the surface, the block chain growth rate is asymptotically approaching zero anyway.

* The current block chain size is about 150.000 MB; does that sound about right?
* If the target block time (10 min if I'm not mistaken) is reached, you'd get **one MB** every **ten minutes**, correct?
* So you get six MB every hour, 144MB every day, and ~52.000MB every year.
* Now these are the 35% you mentioned. 

What you seem to ignore or forgot to mention is that next years block chain will start at ~ 200.000MB, still growing at roughly 52.000MB/year.

Not to mention the insanity of arguing supply and demand of the 'ability to move a digital asset'.

edit: I forgot to mention, I think you're right, 2MB blocks would probably fill up, as - I expect - would 4MB blocks. But this way you could get transactions validated faster and cheaper - which was the whole point of BTC in the first place.

Besides that, why do you think that people would rush back to BTC? It had its first-mover advantage and far-reaching merchant implementation and lost it due to being unreliable and - to a large extend - unusable for payments. 
If the implementation for LN sees similar levels as the SegWit implementation I don't see a chance for it solving the congestion issue.

That is totally OK. Block Size increase was never meant to be a silver bullet or even a long term plan. It was always meant to be a short term fix while a long term solution is being developed or as part of a long term solution.

Same as SegWit in that regard. SegWit on its own does not provide much scaling (and can not provide more than that), but it was always advertised as a first step to lightning.

We could have made a Block Size increase while lightning is being developed and given that lightning also might need a Block Size increase anyways to function correctly it would have made sense to do it sooner rather then later.

"Miners can put whatever they want on the block and propagate it, they could basically Spawn coins by sending themselves money that doesn't exist (i.e. making a transaction from an empty wallet). Other miners would discover this and ignore his block, but if a miner controls 51% of the hashpower he can grow the main chain faster than all the other miners and to the chain with his invalid block would become the default one.

Probably impossible, because even if 30 or 20% of the hashpower remains honest they would probably still work on the non-default chain (because they know the other one is invalid), which would cause an split, and  probably imply in lower difficulty, which attracts more miners to the second chain, and since the attack would only last for as long as someone can maintain 51% the blockchain would eventually stabilize. 

However if someone can maintain 51% for a long time he would push the other miners out, because the miners are making a bet, that the faulty chain will eventually fail, and his chain (which he mined more easily) will be chosen, but if that takes a while to happen the miner might just go mine something else, further increasing the power of the attacker. But even then if the community discovers this it's easily verifiable and that chain can be purposefully ignored by most wallets, rendering the attack useless.

"> Bitcoin nodes generally have higher bandwidth allocated to them than Ethereum. ... a much higher percentage of Bitcoin nodes reside in datacenters

The paper seems to use ""nodes"" confusingly to mean ""miners"" (as was the definition while Satoshi was around) or ""non-mining relays"" (the layer of volunteer middlemen that cypherpunks inserted between miners and clients to after he left).

Those non-mining relays should not exist.  They do not contribute anything to the network; on the contrary, they break its (already weak) security guarantees.  They are one of the fatal flaws that, objectively, made bitcoin a failed project already by 2013.  (That particular flaw could be fixed by eliminating those relays; but, while technically easy, it is politically impossible.)

> Both Bitcoin and Ethereum mining are very centralized, with the top four miners in Bitcoin and the top three miners in Ethereum controlling more than 50% of the hash rate.

This is another fatal flaw that made bitcoin a failure; and this one has no known remedy, not even in theory.  Centralization of mining is unavoidable for several economic reasons, independent of details of the protocol.  

But here the paper uses ""miner"" when it should more properly say ""pool"".   For centralization purposes, pools are the main concern; but it is worth distinguishing them from the miners, since the latter may migrate between pools.   (Although, as the authors note, this possibility is often exaggerated by bitcoin fans, and the migration may be in the direction opposite to what they are counting on.)

> Put another way, some hash power is wasted on uncles, which do not help carry out directly useful sequencing work on the chain.

This is not seem correct, since it apparently does not take into account the dependency of hashpower on efficiency and the difficulty adjustments.  While every miner hates to see his block orphaned, because of those compensation mechanisms the orphan rate has no effect on the total revenue of the miners, their profit margins, their total energy expenditure, or the capacity and response time of the network.   

Namely, the throughput and delay are constant because the rate of non-orphan blocks is constant; the market dynamics will tend to keep the profit margin constant, and the energy expenditure will be a fixed fraction of the block revenues, which are constant.";6;1;False;jstolfi;dsr7pfq;"Peer-reviewed Bitcoin study finds ""no sound, quantitative arguments against maximizing block size""";http://hackingdistributed.com/2018/01/15/decentralization-bitcoin-ethereum/

Between 2016 and now, Bitcoin got SegWit, which is an actual block size increase from 1MB to about 1.8MB - 2.0MB (theoretical maximum is just short of about 4.000.000 Bytes). So the update did just what the paper claims to be a reasonable increase considering the median bandwidth increase of nodes, if the levels of decentralization in 2016 are deemed good enough by users of Bitcoin (meaning that one could argue that they are not, or that lesser decentralization would still be ok)

"Take this with a grain of salt, but this represents my current understanding:

The SegWit discount has a technical background. 

Basically, old miners can verify blocks with SegWit transactions, despite not knowing about SegWit at all. When a non-updated Bitcoin node requests the block data, SegWit enabled nodes remove everything the other node wouldn't understand. This is possible because SegWit was designed to allow this, and because it doesn't change any of the previous consensus rules, it just adds new ones for SegWit nodes. It's the reason why SegWit is a soft fork, whereas raising the block size limit would be a hard fork (meaning miners with old node software would reject those blocks). 

A soft fork was the preferred solutions by developers at the time, as there was no consensus on how much to increase the block size, which might have resulted in various forks of Bitcoin, each with a different block size limit or new rule on how to grow the block size naturally. This would have caused big headaches for the security assumptions in PoW cryptocurrencies, especially if they all have the same PoW algorithm. It would have made all of them more insecure.

So why the discount for SegWit? As old nodes don't see SegWit data, but only the parts of the transaction which can be validated by old nodes, a SegWit block is basically up to 1MB (the old limit) + the segregated witness data. The segregated witness data is (roughly speaking) the part that was once added to the ScriptSig, so just the signature and public key. Because of that, certain parts of the transaction (input ids, outputs, etc) will always have to remain in the old block, while the signature and key (which make up a good portion of a transaction, byte wise) are in the new part. This new part is the part that gets the discount. And the only reason why the size of the new part is even limited to 3MB (and not just not counted at all) is to protect the network against artificially inflated blocks that have transactions that do nothing sensible but only try to inflate blocks as much as possible, as all useful transactions have a certain ratio of old part and new part, which seems to cause a maximum of 50% of data ending up in the new part.

Additionally, because SegWit transactions are not vulnerable to a certain type of attack that causes high CPU usage when verifying blocks with certain transactions, this attack vector was not made more potent with this type of block increase, as you can still only add the same amount of non-SegWit (but vulnerable/exploitable) transactions as before.

All said and done, IMO the primary reason was to not create a hard fork and split the community into many shards, thereby making double spends and attacks on the network more likely. At the same time, they could still increase tx/s that way.";1;0;False;bitcoincashthrowx2;dsrtvz7;"Peer-reviewed Bitcoin study finds ""no sound, quantitative arguments against maximizing block size""";http://hackingdistributed.com/2018/01/15/decentralization-bitcoin-ethereum/

"BCH could be one way.

Sending currencies is forbidden, to do so, the person have to create an account in one of the government's banks and when they receive it, it is automatically exchanged in a extremely low rate. Right now the rate would 3345 Bolivars per dollar, while the parallel market price is 182000, this price changes daily.

So a person that have a family in another country that wants to receive from them, they have to contact someone that exchanges that currency to Bolivars, send him the currency, and then he have to send it to the recipient. It's not very safe, but as long the person that does it have good reputation, you are okay.

> The top 20% of earners pay 95% of taxes already. The top 2% pay 50% of all taxes and therefore society has these top earners to thank.

cute numbers. how about this perspective: the bottom 80% has so little wealth they could only contribute 5% of total tax collected. that's related to my next point:

> How much more do you think is fair?

do spend a second about what the above numbers mean: some dude without any savings that has a family to feed is paying a whole month's rent worth of money in taxes while some other dude is paying what is literally a pocket change for him compared to the wealth he has already accumulated.

and maybe the poor chump earned it. maybe they are lazy or not trying or a million more reasons. the real question here is not what is fair to the poor guy and to the rich guy but how to tune the knobs of the system such that the society overall is better off.

how many people do you think turn to crime because they see no other way out? how many people end up at the bottom because their parents couldn't afford better education or paying rent in better location? how much richer would top 2% be if everybody was better educated, more productive and could afford more goods and services? isn't that ultimately the measure you want to optimize for?

so to answer your question:

> How much more do you think is fair?

fairness is not the goal because it's impossible to define. well functioning society is the goal. and to get there we probably need much more - negative income tax or universal basic income. ultimately, for a rational person, personal wealth doesn't matter past certain point.

also if your argument is that the system should be merit-based then your perfect tax-less society would be the worst, as from generation to generation overwhelming majority of wealthiest citizens would get their wealth from inheritance and they have earned none of it.";0;1;False;keymone;dss409w;Today I sold an S9 to a guy, and his story was a gut punch;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7qokg8/today_i_sold_an_s9_to_a_guy_and_his_story_was_a/
"Maybe one day you will start a successful business or earn a lot of money. You will understand this then I guarantee it.

Right now, the ""poor bottom earners"" are not kept down by some greedy capitalists, as many liberals and socialists would say.

My father shutdown his business because they raised minimum wage so high here so quickly.  **He was tired of working 12 hour days to make less than his employees**. 

7 people are now out of work. He was barely making enough profit before, but was solvent and had a happy job for his employees and serving the community.

Now he works a shit job, earning more and have more free time. The others are not fighting for jobs in the marketplace.

Socialist policies like raising minimum wage only create disincentives for the ambitious and hard working folks.

Whatever you say, it is obvious to anyone here that worked hard their whole life or owns a business that you have not been on both sides.

We are immigrants and came with nothing to this country and paid back ALL subsidies and grants when we arrived, unlike the new immigrants that serve as democrat voting cattle and remain stuck on welfare.

We even went bankrupt twice and worked all 2-3 shitty jobs for 15 years to make things happen.

We could have blamed the capitalists and sat on our asses like **most of the other immigrants** that came into the country at the time.

These guys sit at coffee shop sipping on water or 1 coffee and gossip all day.

We fucking went door to door offering our labour and reinvesting in ourselves.

The myth of the greedy capitalist and poor underworked proletariet is bullshit.

I hear half of these peoples stories and I want to smack them for being such complaining losers expecting things handed to them. 

They blame the system and patriarchy amd what have you... yet they waste money on booze, smokes, lottery, shitty reality television, overpriced cars, designer brand shit and the newest iphone to show off to other food stamp collectors.

Me? I'll drive my shitty 15 year old used cars, buy things on bargain and haven't watched TV in 20 damn years.

You cannot tell me that a poor person watching ANY amount of TV is being kept down.... they are willfully wasting their time here on this planet



**reasons for fall of Rome**

6 of the 8 reasons for the fall have to do with:

- mass immigration/migrants
- high taxes, heavy welfare state
- political corruption (need bureaucrats to adminster social programs)
- inflation due to taxes for military spending
- rise of liberalism (fall of traditional values)

"1) you’ve just dumped a ton of anecdata, which while interesting to read and useful experience for you, is unfortunately not at all useful to make big-picture conclusions like you do. I mean you’ve just piled stereotype upon stereotype. Lazy poor people sipping coffee all day and watching tv, yeah right.

And it’s not like you have to convince me than most countries didn’t get social policies perfectly right, the thing we are talking about is if social policies can work in principle and if there can be rational argument to prefer them over extreme libertarian policies.

2) as I said, it is still open question why Rome fell among historians and you find data that supports any political ideology of today, not really worth going into details.

Besides, of those reasons you described I can’t quite see the connection with social policies. Heavy military spending is not a social policy. Neither is having corrupt politicians nor rise of liberalism. It just looks like a wishful thinking of a conservative. Consider your biases when googling for and interpreting information. Confirmation bias is a bitch.

Ok, wait. Are you serious right now?  
I am from Eastern Europe, where wages are much lower than in 1st world countries (Weestern Europe, USA, Canada, NZ, AUS, etc), however still a normal summer bill is like $30 and a normal winter bill is averaging $100 to $200 (because you need to pay for heating during the winter, who the fuck has airconditioner to use in the summer to cool off :D ).  
So you are telling me that in Venezuella a family of 4 that cooks, uses some heating, has lights on, computer on, etc, pays $0.04 (four cents) for a monthly electricity bill?  
  
EDIT:  
I just checked Numbeo, it's my favourite place to check Cost of Living, and they only have on city in Venezuella - [Caracas](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/in/Caracas)  
Accordin to the website (and its firly accurate - I've checked it for a few locations I've lived in, in different countries) some things are ""normal"" price for even a western country and some things are quite cheap.  
For instance cheap is Internet - just $3 a month, Gasoline - $0.01 for a litter (what the fuck, it's over $1 here), monthly electricity and water bills $11 for 85 square metters appartment - this is really cheap still.
Expensivish are: Meal for 2 in a restourant - $38 (not that that's a lot, but compared to the rest), Taxi - $1 per km (when Gasoline is $0.01 wtf).

why you are thinking that you are greedy? besides people who really just buy Cryptos to be more ""powerful"" and ""have more"" we all, buy, sell, HODL because of various reasons.
Some do it because they wanna feed their family, some other people do it because they want to buy a lambo!
I for example do it because i wanna see my family debt free and after that go finally for a trip to japan!
i am at the beginning at my 30, unemployed and hitting the school again (don't know how to translate in english what i am exactly doing), and living on the edge with his money till 2019! Crypto seemed to me the best way to achieve those things before my mother getting too old! (because i want to see her travel too alot when she is retired)

But in the end, we all do it because we wanna achieve things which seems to be impossible to us before!
We are after all still humans with needs and wants! We are seeing an opportunity and we try to grab it, because nobody knows when we will see the next one!

so if you are a god damn multi millionaire who just invest because ""HE CAN"" you should feel like a greedy asshole who does more bad than good to this world.

but if you're just a regulare person who has a dream, no matter what, if its never going to work anymore (and have 24hours for friends and family) or a lanbo (because its a car you always wanted to own), you should not punch yourself in the gut. You just try to do your best.

Or like Terry Crews said:
> “Everybody says they're trying to get their piece of the pie. They don't realize that the world is a kitchen – you can make your own pie.”

and after you're done with baking, you can share it or help people to make their own pie! Ü

"Hola!

Cryptos are misunderstood by most people, but I guess that could be said about most countries. Now with the new government's ""crypto"" people are even more confused. 

Most people see them as ""videogame currency"" which is funny because even the WOW currency is worth more than the Bolivar.

I didn't payed attention to them until a week ago, and I've been a bit obsessed over it since. Currently in Venezuela there's a paper money shortage, to the point that I couldn't even found enough to pay the bus to college today so I had to go by foot.

Paying with a debit card is scary because you risk being clone, my mom's card was cloned last year.


The US dollar is the de facto currency for anything that's expensive,  for example a phone, bike, car, or house. If real dollars arent exchanged then they use Bolivars but keeping the exchange rate. Because not even banks allows you to place all the necessary 0s when they try to make a transaction.

And that's the issue, being forced to use a currency and being penalized if you dare to use something that works better.

While walking I was thinking of BCH could help, and I remembered a video that was posted here today about a BTC example in Uganda, and it's very similar. The video was about a men that received money from the US to pay for his expenses with the advantages that you didn't had to have a bank account. I think cryptos can work for that too, sure. But maybe even more, since people use dollars to pay for stuff here, instead of risking for the papermoney to be confiscated or stolen, you can use BCH.

Can I add something? Capitalism has NOTHING to do with being greedy (or an asshole). This is such a fallacy. Capitalism is about C H O I C E. You can choose what you want! How horrible is that? If a product is so good it compels you to trade your hard earned currency for it then that's an impressive feat, and kudos to the producer for improving a living situation. You can choose to not buy it. The producer can choose to use any profits to feed himself or send 100% to some needy Venezuelans/Haitians/Salvadorans/Pakistanis/... who are not fortunate enough to have such a wise system of governance. It's his choice.

If you're feeling guilty about having excess, then consider reflecting on *why* you have that excess. It's wasn't free. It was a clear gift to posterity from people who set up the system.

My feeling is if people have more control over their own money and it is less curruptible, then that will lead to more commerce, less poverty overall... maybe even less war.

Am interested to hear how cryptos can be used to help in places like VZ.. also I notice DOGE coin is used in places like Pakistan, Cote-d'Ivoire and others.  Very interested to see if it can help these people.

The problem is that efficiency very often means centralisation. Those who are ahead have the advantages they need to stay ahead.

some prices from that site are close, but some are way to off. The taki price is plain out wrong. I can get a taxi to another city around 7 km away, I guess, for about $0.40-50 in total.

But taxis are becoming more expensive every week because the repair parts become more expensive. So they charge more than just the gas price.

"The government finds out about miners in 3 ways:
1. The government owns the country's main internet provider (Cantv). By monitoring internet usage, they can trace the type of internet traffic usually generated by mining operations.
2. The government also owns the country's power providers. They track unusually high demand and inspect in suspicious cases.
3. Snitches. Since mining is ""illegal"", the country's security forces seize any mining rigs they find. The rumour goes the goverment's officials then install these in their own protected farms. There's a big incentive for any connected official to find large-scale mining operations and basically steal the machines.
