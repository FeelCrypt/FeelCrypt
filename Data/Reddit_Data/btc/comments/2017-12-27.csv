I said the two statements were INcompatible, and I said bitcoin has changed. I didn't say his vision was impossible. But first off, nobody knows exactly how Satoshi would have reacted to either the BCH fork or the current-day state of Bitcoin. Would he have supported bigger blocks? There's evidence he would've. Would he support Roger Ver's vision of an unlimited blocksize? I doubt it. There's too many arguments against it from a centralization standpoint which was Satoshi's entire point of creating Bitcoin. But, things like Segwit, Schnorr signatures, Lightning Network... didn't exist back then. Who knows if Satoshi would've supported them as solutions to the scaling problem over bigger blocks.  It's like trying to predict if George Washington would've supported same-sex marriage. If you had asked him in 1776, he likely wouldn't have. If you transported him to today, he might change his point of view after having time to study from a current-day point of view.;1;1;False;chazley;drtbh9v;rBitcoin logic: Cashing out?

I’m now glad to have BCH to follow the vision that got me excited about Bitcoin in the first place.

"> Want to discuss?

Sure, not sure how long I'll be online for. To start, here are a few points that I think we can both agree on:

- Bitcoin's success is due in part to the fact that it is decentralized. Other crypto-based currencies existed before Bitcoin, but they failed because they were centralized.
- Scaling is a real problem that Bitcoin is facing today.
- When it comes to scaling any system, the simple solution isn't always the best one.

Now, the fundamental areas where I think the two subs disagree:

* Solving scaling is an urgent concern.
  * Core supporters are generally of the mindset that preserving fundamentals (i.e. decentralization) is more important than scaling to meet the current demand.
  * BCH supporters feel that with fees at their current level, Bitcoin has become functionally useless, and will be replaced unless it fixes the problem soon.
* Block size increases are a viable means of scaling Bitcoin while preserving sufficient decentralization.
  * Most core supporters acknowledge that 1 MB is too small, especially in the long term, but also recognize that identifying the exact number at which centralization becomes problematic is hard.
  * BCH supporters feel that the amount of decentralization sacrificed by scaling the block size is not enough to undermine decentralization of the entire system.
* Bitcoin's value proposition is, in part, its use as a payment processor.
  * Core supporters feel that this is a ""nice to have"", and that the true value lies in its auditability, immutability, and the ability for people to control their own wealth.
  * BCH supporters feel that this use case is a critical use case, and the only way to accomplish the goal of ""banking the unbaked"" since the fees make the network completely inaccessible to many of the unbanked.
* Satoshi's whitepaper set out a vision for the evolution of Bitcoin.
  * Core supports see the whitepaper as a description of the system as it existed in 2009, along with suggestions as to how it might scale if it grew at a rate similar to Moore's law.
  * Bitcoin Cash supporters see the whitepaper as a vision for scaling Bitcoin.

If you agree with the above points, it should follow that each respective coin has made choices that best serve the priorities of each group.

* BCH has opted to focus on the ""simple"" scaling solution, while acknowledging that it will lead to some degree of centralization. Core has chosen to wait on second- and third-layer scaling solutions to mature before attempting to scale the base layer.
* BCH has chosen to scale immediately to enable payments-related use cases (fix the fee situation). Core has decided to wait until the full effects of Segwit, LN, sidechains are realized.

Now, some of my own arguments in favor of Bitcoin:

- No decentralized cryptocurrencies have solved scaling yet. Ethereum can handle roughly 5x the throughput, but that's not significant in the big picture. As a result, I feel BCH supporters tend to overstate the sense of urgency.
- Decentralization seems easier to lose than to reacquire, and so I think we should avoid making changes which we acknowledge could lead to greater centralization while there are still other options.
- Re: use as a payment processor, I used to think this was critical, but now feel like it is less important than preserving fundamentals. Centralized Bitcoin is inferior to VISA and PayPal.
- As a software engineer, my personal experience has taught me that vertical scaling (i.e. block size increases) sounds easy, but in practice there are always emergent issues which require rearchitecting the system to some degree. 2 MB blocks might work fine without any fundamental changes, but the same isn't yet known for capacities beyond this.
- I feel scaling based on Moore's law is impractical, since Bitcoin's adoption has been happening at a much faster rate than Moore's law. And in any case, Moore's law does not apply equally to the different areas in which Bitcoin needs to scale (processing power, memory capacity, network bandwidth). Furthermore, there's no guarantee that Moore's law will continue indefinitely. We are already nearing the theoretical limits on transistor size, for example.
- Bitcoin still has the majority of developer talent and interest.

And finally, my own arguments in favor of BCH:

- ASICs already make mining inaccessible to most users of the system; requiring more expensive hardware to mine likely isn't going to be a significant barrier to entry beyond this.
- Clearly BCH is better for the payments use case today; if this property, along with improving network effects, enables it to overtake Bitcoin, then it's possible it'll attain majority market share and developer interest could follow.

It's probably clear from this that I personally feel Bitcoin's approach is more viable. However, I continue to hold equal amounts of BTC and BCH because I think there's a good chance I'll be wrong.";65;7;False;farsightxr20;drt4qfu;rBitcoin logic: Cashing out?

"**Tu quoque**

Tu quoque (, also ; Latin for, ""you also"") or the appeal to hypocrisy is an informal logical fallacy that intends to discredit the opponent's argument by asserting the opponent's failure to act consistently in accordance with its conclusion(s).

Tu quoque ""argument"" follows the pattern:

Person A makes claim X.

Person B asserts that A's actions or past claims are inconsistent with the truth of claim X.

Therefore X is false.

An example would be

Peter: ""Based on the arguments I have presented, it is evident that it is morally wrong to use animals for food or clothing.""

Bill: ""But you are wearing a leather jacket and you have a roast beef sandwich in your hand! How can you say that using animals for food and clothing is wrong?""

It is a fallacy because the moral character or past actions of the opponent are generally irrelevant to the logic of the argument.

"Couple of things: the Core narrative has created problems that don't exist and magnified small problems that do exist. Worrying about the viability of a fee market before 2140, for example, when the block reward has continued to keep mining viable throughout many difficulty changes and halvenings. The reason for creating a fee market 120-odd years early is purely to create a financial incentive for the second layer.

Scaling is being worked on, and again isn't the problem that has been shouted about. Processing power is capable of handling Visa scale on current hardware. Storage is already more than keeping pace with adoption and again can handle much more demand than we're currently putting on it. Bandwidth is more of an issue, but it's also increasing so there's no point in not at least keeping up with the hardware. Innovations like Xthin and Graphene are happening outside of Core's purview to make maximum use of that bandwidth.";5;1;False;nolo_me;drtjz0g;rBitcoin logic: Cashing out?

For a crypto currency to be taken seriously as the main currency for the whole planet fees must be as low as possible, especially since there are poorer people who can't afford to pay 50c in fees (and absolutely not 30USD). Congestion must not happen. I feel this is very important to get more people onboard. Even 50c fees are way too much. We need to show the world that it is possible with <1c fees.

> Re: use as a payment processor, I used to think this was critical, but now feel like it is less important than preserving fundamentals. Centralized Bitcoin is inferior to VISA and PayPal.

The only thing that really matters is *miner* decentralization. I don't believe on chain scaling causes any issues here. Non mining nodes are irrelevant.

Which is why there is a 1GB block testnet running for a couple of months already. Issues in the software, like threading issues are actively taken care of. Other bottlenecks will be identified before there is any demand for 1GB blocks.

There is no guarantee that Moore's law will hold up, that is true. But at the same time it is theoretically already possible to scale to 1TB blocks [today](http://blog.vermorel.com/journal/2017/12/17/terabyte-blocks-for-bitcoin-cash.html), after fixing potential software issues. 1GB really shouldn't be too much of an issue, once demand has risen.

> Bitcoin still has the majority of developer talent and interest.

I disagree. Bitcoin Cash has multiple independent development teams (decentralized development, yay) and in these teams highly talented people. Many other developers in the Bitcoin space are porting their BTC functionality to BCH, there really is no reason for BTC [ecosystem] developers to not develop for BCH, as the chains are obviously very compatible. Even more so, Segwit adds a ton of technical debt. Not having it makes the base protocol more robust and easy to work with.

"**Pyramid**

A pyramid (from Greek: πυραμίς pyramis) is a structure whose outer surfaces are triangular and converge to a single point at the top, making the shape roughly a pyramid in the geometric sense. The base of a pyramid can be trilateral, quadrilateral, or any polygon shape. As such, a pyramid has at least three outer triangular surfaces (at least four faces including the base). The square pyramid, with square base and four triangular outer surfaces, is a common version.

"You misunderstand me. I was saying that the idea you need 40 billion to increase the market cap 40 billion is false.

In other words, for BTC's market cap to double, you don't need to put in as much money as its current market cap. Do you get what I'm saying?

Let's say we have an order book like this:

limit buy - 1 btc @ $1
limit buy - 1 btc @ $99

limit sell - 1 btc @ $101
limit sell - 1 btc @ $1000

Our market price meets in the middle - $100. That's roughly what you'd pay to buy one (technically it's $99 for selling, $101 to buy, but ignore that). If you wanted to drive the price up from $100 to $1000, all you have to do is buy that 1 btc @ $ 101. Similarly, to drive the price *down* to $1, all you have to do is sell 1 btc @ $99.

"I saw XRB being mentioned. That's absolutely not a shitcoin, but a top coin. I already have more than 3x'd with it and I have no intention to sell.

XVG, on the other hand, is total vaporware but its market cap is too high for low risk profits. The big gains have already been made, it may dump for good any day now.

The sad reality is that the current state of crypto is built entirely on hype. 99% of the coins listed on CMC are utter shit. Therefore, apart from investing in the few solid projects, you can throw a few bucks on the shitcoins that have ridiculously low market caps and appear to be the most promising. If the website looks good and the project is hypeable I invest. I'm not even kidding. The trick is to sell as soon as the coin approaches your target. Buy low, sell high. That's it. Don't sit on it for too long, otherwise you'll end up bagholding it. 

Of course, you'll get burned every now and then. And most importantly, this only works in a bull market, where everything goes up. So this actually requires a rational portfolio allocation. Never go all in on a shitcoin.

Example: PRL (too late for my tastes now), HAT, BNTY, SCT

You have an unfortunately tenuous grasp of economics and the modern financial system. Banks are not evil, they are companies providing a service - a service that allows the economy to function as it does. They are no better or worse than any company. Are there problems? Sure and cryptos address some of those problems but create a new set of problems altogether. Taking such a moral standpoint is naïve and unproductive. Of course you can support cryptos for moral reasons (although I'd argue crypto won't solve most of the issues you have with the traditional banking system) but you should remember what this system is and what is isn't. If anything crypto is more amoral than banks because everything is automatic. Posts like this are exactly why the mainstream writes off crypto and everyone is crying bubble. It shows unrealistic idealism and a fundamental lack of knowledge about basic economics, which leads to questioning the merits of the actual tech because the supporters are so often completely uncredible that they shouldn't be taken seriously.

"> BANKS KNOW THAT, banks know that a percentage will not be able to pay of the mortgge and in the end they will have a huuuuuuuge chunk of extra scam money instead of insuring the people for these sidecases when they can not pay the mortgage anymore

That's not how banks or mortgages work. Foreclosures are money losers for banks. It's exceedingly rare that they make any money on a foreclosure and it's almost never worth the time and expense of it. 

Risk modeling is the single biggest part of finance and banking. Mitigating losses is why. The better a bank is at reducing delinquencies and defaults, the less they have to hold in reserve to cover delinquencies and defaults. Which makes the bank more efficient and profitable.

"> BANKS KNOW THAT, banks know that a percentage will not be able to pay of the mortgge and in the end they will have a huuuuuuuge chunk of extra scam money 

FYI banks do not make a penny of profit from foreclosures. If it gets to the point that they take possession of a home and sell it, they are only legally permitted to keep/take back money already owed to them. This usually results in a loss on their books, as there is rarely enough equity left to do even this (the owner would probably just sell it themselves if they could have done so to avoid the foreclosure),  but if there is, the bank has to give the borrower the difference.

"Just read through the thread, ripple is a great coin and is implemented well. However it's use-case means it won't be a digital currency (and it's not trying to).

Its to provide a better way to do international banking transactions on a large scale.

This means two things:

 buying into ripple won't really make you money (in fact by design it is suppose to deflate the price by adding additional currency so that the price stays stable).

And

Its much stronger than most cryptos when it comes to keeping its value.


This means that if you want a store of value, ripple is the answer - You are pretty safe that it won't lose much in value.

"First, it'd be nice if you admitted you are wrong about mortgages and foreclosures. It's a fabrication. It shows you don't understand basic fundamentals about the industry.

But let's move on. 

>Its easy, the real people are working on creating real things, they are sweating, they are breaking their body, the banks are just supporting that work leaning back in their chair, they are not actually working...

I'll bet you have never actually worked in a bank. Because finance is just as much of a job as any other. Managing lending portfolios is difficult and requires a lot of knowledge to do well. 

And lending itself is absolutely required for society. Without it, businesses couldn't acquire the capital they need to run the business. People couldn't save to buy a house. It's integral and necessary to life and society since the middle ages. 

>The only work the banks do is to aquire more customers and sell them even more products after initially scamming them with the costs of having a bank account and doing transfers! 

Do you think that it doesn't cost anything to actually run a bank? Because it isn't a scam to charge for a service that's provided. 

Non-interest income is growing as a percentage of banking revenue, that's true. But a large part of that is the low interest rate environment we're in. Borrowers rationally look for the lowest rates, which makes interest income a less than optimal revenue stream. Interest rates also fluctuate, making it more difficult to predict interest income for fixed rates loans. No one really likes fees, but it's part of the business. 

>You can not even choose to have a bank account, you MUST have a bank account in most european countries if you want to work legally at all...

You also must buy food and use transportation.

"XRP is *technically* decentralized because it exists in the same way as other coins.  The validations nodes simply don't produce XRP when they validate.

Also, due to it using a traditional block chain validation network, it allows trustless transactions just like any other crypto.

Well, thanks for sharing your views. As for me, I don’t support the idea of unlimited blocksize, but I think right now and, until a better solution is found, bigger blocks are a better option compared to segwit and lightning network. Specially LN, simply because to me it can lead to centralisation faster than any other current solution due to the high price of the nodes. I know it’s more complicated than that, but right now I feel BCH is a better option. And I’m not even talking about the price. BTC can stay the first in price and I’d still prefer the current speed and low fees of BCH. And of course if BTC finds a way to improve speed and take fees back to the cent level while staying decentralised, I’ll start using it again in a heartbeat.;2;0;False;quirotate;drtepbe;rBitcoin logic: Cashing out?

"I’m not sure you know what a conspiracy theory is if you think my saying the LN will require AML/KYC is one. It is speculation, but it comes from a reasonable interpretation on how LN works and the current laws around money transmission. Again, if you know a rebuttal to this claim, point me to it - I’d be curious to read it. 

Even if LN had millions of hubs (I’m very skeptical as there is currently no network in existence with their proposed topography), no one is going to pay a $20 fee to lock up money for coffee. And the more usage LN on Bitcoin gets, the higher that fee goes since there would be more users on the network instead of HODLers. It doesn’t make sense to think Bitcoin + LN alone will scale to worldwide adoption. Again, if you have a source describing otherwise, send a link. The LN white paper itself describes how limited its capacity will be assuming a 1mb blocksize with 2 transaction _per year_ per user and all Bitcoin transactions being used for LN. And not all block space would be used for LN as currently none is used for it (and none is used for coffee purchases now either!)";2;0;False;themgp;drtcob5;rBitcoin logic: Cashing out?

">  the Core narrative has created problems that don't exist and magnified small problems that do exist.

Do you have other examples of these problems aside from the fee market one?

> Worrying about the viability of a fee market before 2140, for example

2 points that I think we can agree on here:

* A fee market becomes _necessary_ at some point in Bitcoin's future to incentivize mining, since there is a hard cap on coin issuance. This is not necessarily 2140, but instead whenever the block reward is no longer valuable enough to bring in sufficient mining hashrate to protect the network. This is tied to price -- assuming the price stabilizes at some point, then we can expect each halving to result in a ~50% drop in hashrate if there are no fees to offset the difference.
* The _current_ block reward is enough to incentivize this level of mining on its own, without requiring any fees.

So then the point of disagreement is: _when_ we should focus on testing a fee market? It's my opinion that since a) this will represent a **huge** change to Bitcoin's incentive structure, and b) we _don't know_ when the price will top out, it is better to test it earlier since we don't know when the system might start falling apart. We'd probably be fine for 4, probably 8 years too, but what about 12? 16? How is BCH going to deal with halvings once its price tops out?

I think this outlines one of the major differences between core/BCH supporters: core is building their system with a focus on the future, BCH is building their system with a focus on today, and assuming that vertical scaling will be enough for the future. Neither approach is strictly better or worse, and the beauty of Bitcoin is that we get to test both approaches at the same time.

> Processing power is capable of handling Visa scale on current hardware. Storage is already more than keeping pace with adoption and again can handle much more demand than we're currently putting on it. Bandwidth is more of an issue, but it's also increasing so there's no point in not at least keeping up with the hardware. Innovations like Xthin and Graphene are happening outside of Core's purview to make maximum use of that bandwidth.

I've been following the ""gigablock"" tests, and have found the results to be interesting. There is definitely some valuable work being done in the client that could be backported to core too. I hope their future tests will be more pessimistic -- e.g. testing the network under a DDoS attack, which is a bigger concern with centralized nodes.

My other concern with these tests would be that they are not representative of real user traffic (this was admitted during their presentation). It's very hard to run a simulation that mimics organic growth. But I think it's safe to say that the client itself can scale to handle much larger blocks than 2 MB.";1;1;False;farsightxr20;dru30n1;rBitcoin logic: Cashing out?

"Oh trust me, I know this sort of post would be censored on /r/bitcoin, I didn't mean to suggest otherwise. My position that ""/r/btc is a cult"" follows from the sort of posts I consistently see on the front page and in the top-voted comments. Anyone new to the tech is _not_ going to get an unbiased introduction from either sub.

Here are the top 10 posts on /r/btc right now:

* **rBitcoin logic: Cashing out? You should kill yourself instead**
* Let's show Elon Musk how easy it can be to accept Bitcoin Cash!
* **Rick Falkvinge:""Fun fact: I am aware of a truckload of companies currently in the process of converting from Bitcoin Legacy to #Bitcoin Cash. I am aware of zero (0) companies going the other direction.**
* **Chris Pacia to Bashco and Cobra: ""I think it's the other way around. If you guys created your own coin with $50 fees it would trade for $0. You only survive because you executed a hostile takeover of the Bitcoin brand and radically changed it without consensus.""**
* **At Blockstream's annual holiday party**
* Shapeshift: ""Our Bitcoin miner fee is set very high due to Bitcoin network congestion, so please avoid small Bitcoin transactions on ShapeShift for now. Anything under $250 USD is unadvisable, and transactions may be delayed for hours.""
* **Greg Maxwell in Feb 2015 : ""Blocksteam's sidechains will be ready in 1 or 2 months"" .**
* Emin Gün Sirer - For the record: BS sidechains require trust. Despite the lip service to the ""trustless reverse peg"" in the white paper, that peg never materialized. In fact, that paper would never pass peer review, because the claims made in it are not achievable with the tech described in it.
* Let me make a bold prediction: BCHBTC is about to rally hard. 0.5 btc is in sight and will be reached
* **The Rise of Darth Backtrack**

More than 50% of these are basic memes/attacks on BTC/core, lacking any degree of substance. I've _never_ seen an anti-BCH post on the front page.

This is a side-effect of the sub's roots (/r/bitcoin defectors) and moderation that is _too_ loose - content becomes low-effort and any posts requiring more than 5 seconds of attention get buried. Without moderation attempting to keep discussion somewhat objective, most people interested in real discussion leave and memes/attacks are all that remains. This results in a cult-like feel whenever I visit this sub.

See /r/science and /r/OutOfTheLoop as counter-examples; they have strict moderation and (IMO) better content as a result. At the same time, I wouldn't call them at all ""censored"".";17;4;False;farsightxr20;drt5o3b;rBitcoin logic: Cashing out? You should kill yourself instead;https://imgur.com/Fo8rZQi

Not saying that is true but it's possible. And no /r/btc is not a cult, if anything it's a counter movement against a cult or .... a place for excult members to share stories about the cult.

"That's how most people in crypto behave sadly. 

If you publicly say that you cashed out because you already made a lot of money all the people will get automatically jealous which results into toxicity in the end.

Someone recently cashed out a lot of ETH over at their sub and a some people became really toxic in the comments as well and got a lot of up votes to the point he deleted every post he made regarding cashing out. 


Why can't people just be happy for other people...?

I mean of you have to cash out at some point. Either because you want actually to use your gained wealth on things instead of staring at it all the time and get a boner of it. Or you have to cash out because you are losing money.


I mean remember what happened last time everyone was dead sure and heavily invested into something? 

2007: The Real Estate bubble everyone heavily invest into burst.

And before that? 

2000: The Tech bubble everyone was dead sure is going to make them super rich.

Before that?

1990 Japanese Stock bubble bursts everyone with considerable money invested into.

In the end what I want to tell everyone is: Not everybody can get rich. As you can see in the past a few will get super rich and many will lose their savings to pay the profits of the super rich. That's how bubble markets work. Just think about how many people lost the majority of their retirement savings in 2008.

Yes Crypto currencies will likely take over the world at some point. But it would take many years maybe even another century or more till we see this really happening on a larger scale. Maybe it won't happen. Maybe it will be something completely different to Bitcoin or Ethereum. For now it's just gambling and speculation which is fine. But as always said: only put the money you are willing to lose into it. If you don't have any money to spare, find a way to earn it. Don't destroy your future because of greed.";3;0;False;Coinzillaa;drt48h1;rBitcoin logic: Cashing out? You should kill yourself instead;https://imgur.com/Fo8rZQi

"Capital is a pyramid scheme.

Not that it's a bad thing, if you are trying to get as high as possible by stacking things, the pyramid is pretty close to optimal. The devil is in the details.

I see banks and such as like stepped pyramids.

I see btc as the bent pyramid.

And I see bch as finally getting it close to optimal all the way up.

Now we walk in the stones and follow the blueprint and we can build up higher than anyone has ever gone before, making the grand pyramid.

The block at the top just has the best view, strong foundations are just as important as the top blocks because only together do you make a pyramid.

Whatever bitcoin that's used must be good enough that the foundation is rewarded enough to keep using it voluntarily. Top heavy pyramids never last.

It's not a bug it's a feature, capitalism is evolving. There is at least one way to do it right/optimal, everything else eventually collapses under it's own weight.

But all the right ways are also the hard ways.

Cults manipulate and censor in order to control. /r/bitcoin does that. /r/btc does not do that. Does not mean our quality is necessarily higher but by definition we are less an echo chamber because it does not ban people for having the wrong opinion and neither does it remove comments it does not want other people to read. And then there is the fact that trolls and shill from /r/bitcoin come over here and since they are not banned it's an uphill fight for us.  But it's slightly improving. The popularity of /u/tippr is a good thing. Hopefully our obsession with /r/bitcoin (yes I struggle with it too) will go down. Best is to ignore them and forget they ever existed or the best scenario would be for reddit to ban r/bitcoin or somebody to buy it and make it private. And then eventually it can reopen and become like how it was until about 2014 - 2015. Because it was great. I still have some of the bitcoin tips I got back then .... worth 600 CAD now.   It was great because the developers threated everybody equally and took a lot of time explaining things and the dialogue and conversation was amazing. Just look at some of the told topic and threats.

">This means that at this point in time, there will no longer be any financial incentive to mine.

Other than tx fees (which isn't necassarily mining, but, in this case it does the same job of keeping the hash power up). So no, the hash rate won't necassarily crash to 0, and the 51% is not inevitable - *if* tx fees are enough incentive. That is your whole argument, but you forgot the '*if*' portion of it. These are the assumptions I mentioned that you're making, in this case it's that tx fees won't support the network. I agree it certainly doesn't *look* good, but time will ultimately tell how the miners (and their associated hash power) respond, and what the available hardware of these future days may allow (as an example, smart phone mining / tx processing may be possible by this time, and the network hashpower could be much more decentralized - less suspect to a 51%).

I don't think any crypto today is going to last forever though, so the whole arguement is a bit silly when taken to the extremes of eternity. But to make a claim in certainty either way is dishonest. I don't understand the end of time details for BTC/BCH too well, but I do know that SN certainly did not overlook this portion of the design. I remember reading on this before, but am struggling to find the sources. The bottom portion of this has a nice offhand comment about it: http://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/emails/cryptography/16/ . One interesting alternative idea I stumbled upon in my searching for a source was the idea that after block rewards run out, mining to upkeep hashpower and collect tx fees may simply be analagous to gov't / public good - an interesting thought!

At any rate, I do agree that in the future there will be different debates, and I don't think either chain (BCH/BTC) will remain econmically viable while competition is cropping up left and right (even if it's just a BTC redo that's beginning on the genesis block once again).

"> why it is not viable is either not clear to me

You need miners to build the chain. If the hash rate is low, any one person can buy up 51% of the hashpower of the chain, and then they can arbitrarily re-build the chain with certain transactions either cut out or re-ordered, allowing for confirmed double-spend attacks and economic embargos on individuals.  Either one will be disastrous  for the chain, as the chain is no longer decentralized, but literally 100% centralized with one actor controlling the chain.  The ledger has become a centralized bank ledger with some steps added in and no rules to prevent the bank from double-spending and reversing transactions.

So, how does blockchain technology encourage miners? A mix of 2 economic incentives--the coinbase (currently 12.5 coins/block, halves once every 4 years, where new coins are simply brought into existence), and mining fees (where coins are moved from transactors to miners).

The key point here is that the coinbase halves roughly every 4 years. Furthermore, it does this perpetually. Additionally, because of how mathematics works, this means that the total number of coins that will ever be mined into existence is capped. (1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + 1/32 + 1/64 + ..... = 1, so this continual halvening is what causes there to be a finite coin limit.)

However, BCH plans to always continually increase block size so that fees remain perpetually small.  But what does this mean 21 halvenings (84 yrs) into the future? The coinbase will decrease to below 1 satoshi and cease being awarded.  Thus, at this point in time, the *only* economic incentive for miners is tx costs. But BCH's plan is for tx costs to be perpetually negligible.  This means that at this point in time, there will no longer be any financial incentive to mine. This means that the hash rate will crash to near 0. This means that a 51% attack will be inevitable on the system.

This means that you can only have 2 or 3 out of the following for a long-term prospective: A) enough mining power to protect against a 51% attack B) a halvening/fixed coin limit or C) perpetually negligible fees.

As losing A) will crash the coin to 0, that's right out.  So you have to choose either 1 of B or C.  If you choose C, then the only option to keep the chain alive is to HF out the halvening/fixed coin limit.

If you want to get more in-depth, even right now in 2017, the BCH chain's hash power is low enough that a 51% attack is possible.  It only has about 20% of the hash power of BTC, and so if just 2 mining pools colluded, they could form a 51% attack.  Additionally, there are only a few mining pools mining it.  And as long as fees are negligibile, the cost of BCH will have to rise at a rate of at least 2x/4years to keep up the current financial incentives at their current rate. Which may be possible for the next 2, 3, 8, 10 years, but BCH's value can only double 6 times (max 24 yrs) before its market cap surpasses that of all of the money in the world today.  I do not think that will be happening so easily, so I do not see any future for BCH past 24 years as a deflationary currency.

But don't worry, in 3~8 years in the future, a debate will start where people start talking abut how awful deflationary currency is, and why the coinbase must be increased to protect the economic viability of the chain.  There's going to be a huge debate, it's going to end in the miners all engaging in a HF for a new fee with non-halvening coinbase.  There's still negligible tx fees, but now you lose however many percent of your net worth per year in perpetuity to inflation.";2;1;False;vU5Zh3fJNzHrn52YYha;drsy83y;"WSJ: ""[bitcoin core] fees have reached an average cost of about $30 per transaction.

">But it's endgame is centralized currency. Which is opposite of bitcoin. 

This is incorrect Core propaganda. BCH has a different philosophy than BTC. In particular, it believes that increased use of the coin will lead to increased decentralization, as the ecosystem grows and the number of miners and businesses built around BCH increases. 


Bitcoin's philosophy, on the other hand, that decreased use will lead to increased decentralization is verifiably false. High transaction fees force BTC users to stay on exchanges and trust third parties. 

>BCH favours centralization, and if it gained wide use, would limit full nodes to those who can buy server farms. Eliminating the point of BTC.

How many users do you think are running full nodes today, and do you think any currency whose economic model rests on full-nodes validating BTC transactions with zero incentive to do so has a lot of promise? 

>Yes, BTC is currently hindered by TX fees/time. But if you want a centralized currency, that currently works. Go use the USD. Since it is the BCH end game.

That is fact. However, to sell out the entire goal of bitcoin to create something that works now, but sacrifices why it was created is pointless. You end up with Visa 2.0. Not currency 2.0.

Sure, feel free to have BCH head in its own direction, but it isn't the direction BTC was created for. So calling it bitcoin anything is just an attempt to ride coat tails.

Bitcoin was created to fight against centralized banks and fractional reserve banking.  A nod to this is inscribed in the first block. If you turn the blockchain into something that disregards this, it is no longer bitcoin. It would just be another payment processor, rather than a new form of currency that helps free people from central banking.

"I apologise for my tone and manner. Let me respond in a manner that is less trollish since you obviously are not yet another brainwashed IOTA shill. Here are my problems with the coins you named:

LTC - All the baggage of BTC with Segwit, only it has slightly faster blocks. Like BTC it is depending heavily on Lightning being a success, and there's no chance that LN is going to be timely or nearly as good as the Core devs have claimed because they are completely overpromising on what it is and what it can do, just like they did with Segwit. Additionally, and tellingly, the creator of LTC does not believe in LTC enough to keep holding it.

VTC - As I understand it, this is basically LTC but ASIC resistant. I do not see ASIC resistance as a particularly good thing. An ASIC resistant coin means your miners are less invested in the future of your coin, and thus can break consensus rules or 51% attack the coin then move on to the next coin when the value plummets after the attack. Additionally, ASIC-resistance opens up your coin to botnet attack vectors.

IOTA - The most centralized coin on the market. A closed-source coordinator node decides which transactions get added to the DAG. The creators routinely confiscate users coins ""for security"" and you have to contact them to retrieve your coin. The coin's marketing team appears to be massive and they constantly claim partnerships with large companies and when they come under scrutiny they double-talk and double-down on their aggression to convince people who are invested in the coin that they are competent and capable, as opposed to liars and charlatans. They have no path-forward for dropping the coordinator node and there is neither theoretical nor empirical evidence that what IOTA claims their system can do is possible without it. You would be better off investing in a team that runs their own MySQL database for processing Cryptocurrency transactions. That at least would be simpler and more efficient than what IOTA has done to create their centralized token.

ETH - Actually I like ETH too so I don't really have that big a problem with the notion that ETH could replace Bitcoin. I will say though that the main problem with ETH is that it is quite complicated, and by virtue of its complexity is open to more attack vectors than Bitcoin.";2;1;False;Zectro;drsps67;"WSJ: ""[bitcoin core] fees have reached an average cost of about $30 per transaction.

This is true, it does happen.

Parents, or people that are obsessed with children always tell those childfree people to have children, they must and it's their purpose. The same way how r/Bitcoin is, ""SegWit will solve the issue""

Now , Childfree people start to believe that they will have a child only if they want to. Sure, that's fine. But as time goes, they also become turn more toxic. They start calling children ""crotch fruit"" or ""assholes"".

The part about trashing bitcoin BTC is also normal because BCH was a fork to preserve the white paper and scale on chain (and do other stuff re-enabling op codes). So, it is normal talking about the differences, it will always occur.

That being said, there is an HUUUUGE difference between the two crowds. I'm yet to see any BCH supporter go after people/businesses/software supporting BTC to harass/astroturf/troll and trash talk BTC. I simply never saw this happening. So any moderately rational being can see what's going on.

"I hope you are around when I post my article about the 10 predictions that the Digital Currency Group made at the end of 2016 for 2017.  I need to hurry cause I want to have it posted on yours.org  before the end of the year. 

Sneak peak: 


1) Bitcoin as a story of value re-emerges as key theme

Yes, but if Bitcoin can't be used as a currency it will not be able to retain this value, because it's not a shiny shoft metal that does not rust. With other words: its store of value is based upon its properties and if it looses some of these key properties like a good medium of exchange with decent speed, cencorship resistance, a open system where nobody can deny you acces (high fees can deny you accces), etc etc. It Bitcoin can not retain these properties that made it popular in the first place it will not be able to remain a store of value. Temporarily having a very high market price because of shennigans on unregulated crypto exchanges is not a very reliable indication that Bitcoin has gone up in value long term. What would be a good indication of Bitcoin being valuated long term is user adoption, but that has significanly gone done in 2017 with companies like Steam dropping support because of high fluctuation of the price. So another important propery of Bitcoin for it to remain usable as a medium of exchange is price stability. Without price stability Bitcoin becomes more usable as a store of value and less usable as medium of exchange but the medium of exchange is the more important one as Bitcoin's intrinsic value is provable lower then gold and even cash money in the form of coins because those are made out of matter that will always retain at the very least a minimum value. 

2) Bitcoin becomes more accessible to retail and institutional investors via ETF(s) 

Only happened towards the end of 2017, so far on about 10 days of trading a total volume of 4,513 XBT futures of 1 BTC was traded. Gemini itself traded  	39,926 Bitcoin in the last 24 hours and over all exchanges the reported amount of Bitcoin that where traded the last 24 hours was  1,341,986 BTC. Why? most regulated< somewhat regulated < shaddy as fuck. We will see if ""real"" investors dare touch Bitcoin in 2018. Sure the ROI looks insane but so does the risk. So far 2017 was more the year that Bitcoin became more accessible to retail and institutional investors. It was however the year that another bitcoin and other crypto fever gold rush started. When even your mother over facebook starts asking about Bitcoin for the first time in 8 years you know the Fear of Missing Out has hit in full force. 


3) Cross border payments/remittances using Bitcoin will hit $1 billion run rate 

Let's have a look at a 2015 article titled: [""Bitcoin Doesn’t Make Remittances Cheaper""](https://medium.com/cryptonight/bitcoin-doesn-t-make-remittances-cheaper-eb5f437849fe). {cryptonight} writes: 

>Some of the industry has woken up to this already, and although Reddit continues to salivate over crypto-money-transfer, it’s hard to argue with the numbers actually generated by real-world use. 

>Rebit’s model (and the model of several other companies> like it) was to eliminate Bitcoin from the end-user’s perspective. Rebit worked with on-the-ground kiosks that accepted hard cash from migrant workers overseas, and then paid out in hard cash to their beneficiaries in the Philippines. Bitcoin was used invisibly behind the scenes to settle the debt between the kiosk (in Hong Kong, Korea, Canada, etc) and the Rebit offices in the Philippines.


....


>In districts with Filipino migrant populations in Canada, Hong Kong, Singapore, these economics have resulted in a flat fee of US$3–5 and an FX spread between 1–1.5% per remittance transaction.


>As a prime example, to send the equivalent of $10 (about a day’s minimum wage in the Philippines) from one city to another, all the pawnshop networks charge 6-7%. When a Bitcoin company, acting on the behest of its sending customer, wants to transfer $10 from one city to another, it needs to pay that same fee.

>If the beneficiary is lucky enough to have a bank account, the costs become flat fees, but banks have traditionally never been good at moving small amounts. (At the $10 range, their flat fees are 10–20% of the principal amount.)


>All told, the costs of a Bitcoin-powered remittance and that of a transaction powered by Moneygram or any other traditional provider are markedly similar, because the local currency needs to flow through the same physical channels.



Has this changed in 2017? Yes, towards the end of 2017 Bitcoin became significanly more expensive then typical services like Moneygram offers. Not because

According to my research, several crypto exchanges and coins are already controlled by members of the FED and AXA Strategic Ventures. But perhaps the biggest worry is the court order won by IRS to gain access to customer identifying data via the Coinbase Exchange.

"I'd like to find something out that I'm having trouble finding information on - maybe some can help:

1. Who gets the fees for segwit - miners or?

2. There is a lot of discussion about how Blockstream ""owns"" bitcoin - what is meant by this, as the commit logs and such show no such dominance that would indicate ownership.  I'm not ""questioning"" this, i just want to know the facts behind things.  Right now, what I'm seeing doesn't allign with what is being said - someone provide me with some information on this?  For the record I think Blockstream is shady AF but I still like truth.   

3.  Someone provide clear insight into what happened with Gavin Andresen and Mike Hearn and the rest of the ""guardians"" -- how did they fall from grace, and by who's master plan?   I've heard that Gavin was shopping around to businesses bigger blocks without anyone else's consensus?    Again, just trying to find some truth in all the piles on info out there (several articles I've read about this blame quite a bit of this whole thing on Gavin, and I think that's just not accurate...but I don't know what IS accurate)

4.  is it true that segwit is patented by blockstream?

"**Mebibyte**

The mebibyte is a multiple of the unit byte for digital information. The binary prefix mebi means 220, therefore one mebibyte is equal to 1048576bytes = 1024 kibibytes. The unit symbol for the mebibyte is MiB. Technically a megabyte (MB) is a power of ten, while a mebibyte (MiB) is a power of two, appropriate for binary machines.

The unit was established by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) in 1998.

"Litecoin has an enlarged supply that has no guarantees that it will not be enlarged again.  I mean once the parameter has been changed, who is to stop it from being changed again? I am not saying that is a good argument, but it has been thrown against BCH and blocksize so many times, I just want to throw it back.  In this case, increasing blocksize makes sense.  Changing the total number of coins or the rate of inflation, does not.

Charlie Lee is a scammer and LTC was a scam.  Nothing he has done lately has changed my opinion on that.  In fact, I think anyone who believes anything he says, is a fool.

He cannot code, he copied the Core code and did a couple of search and replaces.  He cannot add features without Core doing it for him.  The latest changes were added by a mysterious figure that then went silent.

"* There are plenty of reasons to be sceptical of segwit 
*  BCH has 8mb blocks and up to 32mb without hard forking (not that hard forking is bad anyway)
* LTCs creator doesnt even believe in it enough to hold any of it
* LN can also be added to BCH if it is good
* LTC has a centralised dev team, BCH has atleast 8
* BCH follows the original whitepaper created by satoshi nakamoto
* LTC is against increasing the block size
* 1GB blocks have already been tested and work on BCH
* Fees are cheaper on BCH
* Larger network effect of BCH
* More support behind BCH
* BCH to enable OpCodes next year
* Better fungibility with the likes of Cash Shuffle next year

There are a TON of reasons BCH is better than LTC. Either you dont know any of these things, or you are spreading a false narrative on purpose...but I'll give  you the benefit of the doubt ;)

For LTC, the faster block rate also increases the chances of orphaned blocks.  It's not 10 minutes like the guy said.  It's 2.5 minutes, which also means the inflation rate is 4 times more.

"I appreciate the reaponse. When investing in BTC for the past 4 years i never saw the need or desire to own any LTC. I was 90% BTC. With the strugges of that network im now about 65% BTC (while holding a slightly larger amount of BCH just because i dumped some BTC lately) 

Its unfortunate that its come to a split. Im an independent. Hard to truly determine whats fact and fiction so im just playing all of it now. It would have been much easier if BTC itsef would have got out in front of the scaling issue last year.

"> I understand BCH is much more useful than BTC, but do investors really care?

In 2012: I understand that BTC is more useful than a wire transfer/paypal payment/credit card transfer, but do investors really care?  I would rather put my money in the stock market.

People used BTC to make payments and then realized that it is easy and secure.  Vendors would change their BTC to fiat as soon as they received it.  In time, vendors realized that BTC was growing in value (compared to fiat) and because it was secure (reliable), they held it.  Hodling = less available to trade.  Scarcity drives price.

The same thing is playing out with BCH.  Merchant acceptance is growing at an exponential rate.  As vendors see that it is stable and rising in price, they will hodl it too.  Eventually, everyone who held BTC because it works will wonder why they're hodling up a Ponzi.

Most of the people who argue against this are reacting emotionally because they have a vested interest to do so (hodl BTC).  When you step back and look at it unemotionally you will see that BTC has none of what drove its price in the early years.";1;0;False;Scott_WWS;drt8za2;"Rick Falkvinge:""Fun fact: I am aware of a truckload of companies currently in the process of converting from Bitcoin Legacy to #Bitcoin Cash.

"We're talking reality here. 7 TPS is the theoretical limit, basically it's 1.7 kb/240bytes, but most transactions are bigger than that and, without segwit widely used, average transaction size for BTC and BCH does not differ much. So yes, 7 vs. 56 in theory, half that in practice. 
28 is still a big improvement, or rather, it's an overkill because BTC problem lies with fees that come from overcrowded mempool; as soon as your capacity surpasses the mempool filling rate, fees plummet. Segwit would be enough for this, it's not adopted mostly for political reasons. But in a tx/s pissing contest, there sure are tougher guys than BCH, LTC among them.

"Yeah, it's difficult to get objective information on cryptocurrencies. 

I understand BTC's throughput to be at maximum 7 minimum (2 address) transactions, so doesn't it follow that BCH does 8x7 = 56? Are there specific reasons that invalidate this? 

I'm honestly not well enough informed about the details behind the currencies to compare LTC to BCH, but in general I have nothing against a fork of BTC, considering BTC seems to lack any adaptability in the near future.

"> On a side note. Has the entertainment industry finally give up in their struggle to take thepiratebay.org offline?

Maybe it's just not a priority anymore.  The Pirate Bay is just not much useful nor visited nowadays; few relevant search hits, porn commercials popping up in separate windows, few people visiting it ... it's just a shadow of it's former self (and I do believe we can thank Pirate Bay for forcing through better legal solutions; remember that when Pirate Bay launched, the only legal alternatives for enjoying commercial culture was through sneakernets).

Sharing closed-source software, probably not so relevant as in the past - there is such a plethora of free software that one can manage pretty well without going pirate - like myself, with very few exceptions I believe I've neither pirated software nor paid for software since the mid-90s.  If people really want to commercialize closed-source-software, they usually sell it as an online service rather than selling copies of the product.

For music, I believe most people have gone the legal route as there are good services available; I believe most people that are interested in Music is using Spotify.  Free music is also slowly gaining traction.

For video, NetFlix and Popcorn Time is popular.  One problem with the latter is that it's only usable for watching the more popular titles, if one wants to access some specific (maybe local) title belonging to the ""long tail"", one is often out of luck.  I haven't tried NetFlix.

"**Public domain**

The legal term public domain refers to works whose exclusive intellectual property rights have expired, have been forfeited, have been expressly waived, or are inapplicable. For example, the works of Shakespeare and Beethoven, and most of the early silent films, are all now in the public domain by either being created before copyrights existed or by their copyright term expiring. Examples for works not covered by copyright which are therefore in the public domain, are the formulae of Newtonian physics, cooking recipes, and all software before 1974. Examples for works actively dedicated into public domain by their authors are reference implementations of cryptographic algorithms, NIH's ImageJ, and the CIA's World Factbook.

"First of all this guy is not telling the truth: fees *aren't* $50 a transaction. If you use segwit you'll pay $5 a transaction and have it confirmed within a couple of hours. Cherry picking is what propogandists like to do. Shame.

On top of that, this guy doesn't understand basic economics: there are high fees *precisely* because Bitcoin is such a success. There is demand, and since block space is of limited supply (as are bitcoins, but I didn't see him complaining about the high price) there is only enough room for the highest bidders. So why are people bidding so much for space on the blockchain? Because **they want Bitcoin** and the fees required are negligible compared to the gain of having Bitcoin. I'll leave the drawing conclusions part to any intelligent reader.

But not only that, this guy is just plain disingenuous: High fees really bother you? Instead of playing politics you should be advocating solutions. If people economize on block space usage and not bid so high for room on the blockchain, fees will go down!

Anyone who doesn't think BCH is eventually going to have huge fees is blind. At some point you have to limit the blocksize. Who's gonna determine the blocksize limit? The miners. Who gets to choose which transactions go through? The miners (This is all from Roger's mouth in the Carvalho interview by the way). What transactions are they going to let through? The ones that give them the most profit. In other words, BCH eventually is gonna have a fee market the same way Bitcoin does.

"I'm supplying a highly technical attempt for destroying bitcoin whereas I think MemoryDealers was talking more network or community issues with destroying bitcoin, but here it is anyways:

this is where bitcoin full nodes are hard-coded to find a 'DNS Server' which will then tell them where all the other nodes are https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/1b2460bd5824170ab85757e35f81197199cce9d6/src/chainparams.cpp#L112 However, hackers and ddos'ers can find where ANY websites is hosted, so I guess this vulnerability exists for ALL websites/IP addresses in existence and is not unique to bitcoin, so don't get too scared?

Here's an example of people already discussing this on Reddit, so sorry for opening an old can of worms, but I'm doing this because I'm still not 100% convinced Bitcoin is safe from these nodes being attacked! ugh. https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/4dicny/dns_seeds_servers_hardcoded_in_bitcoin/";1;0;False;thinkocapo;drswjfs;How to destroy Bitcoin;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7m7l72/how_to_destroy_bitcoin/
