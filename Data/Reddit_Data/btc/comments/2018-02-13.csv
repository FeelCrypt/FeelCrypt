"No, SegWit was a soft **fork**, the *soft* part doesn't make it any less of a fork, on the contrary, it makes it worse as it took away the option to vote on it from the users. It was implemented by a slight of hand and deception. There is a reason why SegWit wasn't implemented as a hard fork, they knew they were defrauding the users and it would never get activated if they had any say in it.

In contrast BCH has forked to **preserve the original Bitcoin** and protect it from this deceptive SegWit fork. And since BCH is still the Bitcoin defined in the original white paper as opposed to the SegWit forked version, it is the blockchain that is and should be considered the continuation of the original chain and therefore just simply Bitcoin as it always has been.";2;0;False;mushner;du6u0sm;I just bought 50 Bitcoin (BCH) ATM machines for a bit under half a million dollars.

"> If Bitcoin is defined by the white paper, and is therefore immutable, lest it's identity is changed, then why did Satoshi make it open source code? This invites change.

The definition of Bitcoin as defined in the whitepaper is immutable, not the code - big difference, you can change the code as has been done numerous times and still conform to the whitepaper, this changed with the addition of SegWit and refusal to raise the 1MB limit (which is NOT in the WP) which caused the code to diverge from the definition in the WP and therefore constitutes a de facto fork.

Take SSL, it's a standard and OpenSSL is an implementation of said standard, you can not change the OpenSSL library (which is also open-source) in incompatible ways with the definition of SSL and claim that it's still implementing the SSL standard, that's not how it works clearly.

This is what happened with Bitcoin, Core devs changed the implementation of the Bitcoin WP in incompatible ways and still claim that it's Bitcoin as defined in the WP, it's NOT!

It's silly to immediately assume everyone on the internet is mad at you when there's a huge range of other emotions that could be hidden in someone's internet words. I don't know where you come from but where I am ""twat"" is pretty meaningless as far as insults go. Consider it might be your own anger you see reflected back at you all over the internet. 

As far as James Franco goes: It's not uncommon to see this clip of him thrown in a lot of things. Just like any meme that involves a celebrity; they rarely react. If this was a massive commercial running on Facebook, Youtube, and/or TV this would be a different matter althogether. Roger Ver is not our mascot or king, if he posts a commercial (which he likely didn't make) that action is not refective of an open source software community.

">The definition of Bitcoin as defined in the whitepaper is immutable, not the code - big difference, you can change the code as has been done numerous times and still conform to the whitepaper, this changed with the addition of SegWit and refusal to raise the 1MB limit (which is NOT in the WP) which caused the code to diverge from the definition in the WP and therefore constitutes a de facto fork.

That's incorrect. The whitepaper states that Bitcoin was at its conception - Bitcoin has changed, since the identity of Bitcoin is built on its brand, and the brand is built on consensus.

Let me make this clear. Bitcoin could drop to $1 per BTC, and it would still be Bitcoin. Just because Bitcoin has taken a route which people do not agree with, does not mean its identity has changed.

>Take SSL, it's a standard and OpenSSL is an implementation of said standard, you can not change the OpenSSL library (which is also open-source) in incompatible ways with the definition of SSL and claim that it's still implementing the SSL standard, that's not how it works clearly.

Of course you can.

>This is what happened with Bitcoin, Core devs changed the implementation of the Bitcoin WP in incompatible ways and still claim that it's Bitcoin as defined in the WP, it's NOT! They stole the brand, only BCH implements Bitcoin as defined in the WP from the genesis block, therefore it IS Bitcoin.

"> The whitepaper states that Bitcoin was at its conception

Yes, and the definition hasn't changed, there was not another WP which updated the original, Bitcoin is Bitcoin as defined, if you change it to deviate from it's defining paper, it's no longer Bitcoin.

> Bitcoin has changed, since the identity of Bitcoin is built on its brand

See? This is where the confusion of the Core camp lies, they somehow believe that Bitcoin is defined by its ""brand"" rather than a scientific paper its protocol is described in, that's bonkers. Brand is susceptible to capture (which is exactly what happened), protocol is not. That's why we do not rely on brand.

Bitcoin is a protocol, it's not defined by a brand, not by a single implementation (such as Bitcoin Core) or by any group (such as Core devs), the only valid definition is the whitepaper.

> and the brand is built on consensus.

See? Another delusion of the Core camp, there was *no consensus* for SegWit as evidenced by hashrate signaling and BCH creation afterwards, it was a highly contentious fork - in the presence of contention, status quo protocol gets to retain the Bitcoin description, if you want to deviate from the WP, you're free to fork off, which SegWit has done, so it's no longer Bitcoin. It's a derivative with changed protocol which stole the branding. It's quite simple and obvious really.

> Let me make this clear. Bitcoin could drop to $1 per BTC, and it would still be Bitcoin. Just because **Bitcoin has taken a route which people do not agree with**, does not mean its identity has changed.

I thought you said previously there was consensus for that change? Do you know what *consensus* means? So now there wasn't consensus? You're getting tangled up in your delusions.

> Of course you can.

Of course you can't. Try it and let me know the results!

"No, because you can't just appropriate a ticker symbol because you want to. It's your opinion that the idea ""best represents bitcoin,"" because others don't agree with you and on top of that, BTC ticker was already taken. BTC always has been and always will be Bitcoin. If you want to make bitcoincash work, then do the leg work and prove it. You're riding coattails trying to steal a symbol because BCH lacks he public support and adoption and you know it. 

Oh yeah and to add to all of that it isn't just a ticker symbol when BCH enthusiasts are calling BCH Bitcoin and using the ticker BTC.


And if you read the post I replied to OP said Bitcoin (BCH) and not Bitcoincash (BTC). So we aren't just talking about a ticker. Bitcoin cash is wholesale trying to steal the symbol BTC *and* the name Bitcoin.

">Yes, and the definition hasn't changed, there was not another WP which updated the original, Bitcoin is Bitcoin as defined, if you change it to deviate from it's defining paper, it's no longer Bitcoin.

Bitcoin has changed from its conception - it is allowed to do that. Just as if Facebook suddenly started charging people to use it, and turned itself into porn site, it would still be Facebook - albeit a very very different Facebook.

>See? This is where the confusion of the Core camp lies, they somehow believe that Bitcoin is defined by its ""brand"" rather than a scientific paper its protocol is described in, that's bonkers. Brand is susceptible to capture (which is exactly what happened), protocol is not. That's why we do not rely on brand.

>Bitcoin is a protocol, it's not defined by a brand, not by a single implementation (such as Bitcoin Core) or by any group (such as Core devs), the only valid definition is the whitepaper.

No, you're wrong. Bitcoin has indeed become a brand worth billions of dollars - this is precisely the reason why attempting to ride the coattails of Bitcoin by stating them to be the real Bitcoin is hugely unethical. 

>See? Another delusion of the Core camp, there was no consensus for SegWit as evidenced by hashrate signaling and BCH creation afterwards, it was a highly contentious fork - in the presence of contention, status quo protocol gets to retain the Bitcoin description, if you want to deviate from the WP, you're free to fork off, which SegWit has done, so it's no longer Bitcoin. It's a derivative with changed protocol which stole the branding. It's quite simple and obvious really.

Funny how only a small fraction of the dev team left and started BCH then.

You're under the delusion that a product/brand/network/company needs to follow its origins to remain as itself. 

This is not true. Case and point? People buy Bitcoin even now. It has changed so much since it was conceived - it is allowed to do that. It is understood to be Bitcoin, and it has Bitcoin's history and path that it has chosen.

>I thought you said previously there was consensus for that change? Do you know what consensus means? So now there wasn't consensus? You're getting tangled up in your delusions.

Apologies, I clearly have to spell out every single thing for you to understand. I clearly meant ""Bitcoin has taken a route which some people do not agree with"".

Asinine. 

>Great, since BTC is not what is described in the Bitcoin white paper, it's no longer Bitcoin. QED.

By that logic, if any company changes from its origins, it is no longer that company.

Good to know.

"From a technical perspective what you're saying doesn't make sense. Bitcoin segwit is valid according to the protocol of bitcoin, they are the same chain. Depending on your point of view, these scenario's are possible:  
- Bitcoin ceased to be bitcoin somewhere between 2009 and 2011, and neither of the current chains are bitcoin.  
- Bitcoin is actually a class of things instead of a specific implementation, but then there are 100 'bitcoins'. The accepted terms for something like that is blockchain and cryptocurrency, not 'bitcoin'.  
- The definition of bitcoin is determined by social contract and/or hashpower, thus BTC is bitcoin.  
- The definition of bitcoin changed the exact moment of the bitcoin cash hardfork.  
- The addition of additional softforked data makes bitcoin not-bitcoin. But in that case, bitcoin ceased to be bitcoin years ago and the entire discussion is moot.

Notice that I said 'the definition of bitcoin changed' under bullet point #3. That is to say, the argument that 'segwit forked away' is not a valid explanation for the bitcoin cash = bitcoin narrative. Because if bitcoin segwit 'forked away' from bitcoin, then why not just use bitcoin without segwit? Your old bitcoin clients without segwit still work, miners continue to add blocks, and exchanges continue to list it under 'BTC'.

> if you want to deviate from the WP, you're free to fork off, which SegWit has done, 

Under that argument bitcoin ceased to be bitcoin long ago. I softforked bitcoin in 2015, as did colored coins, and omni layer. Although these are not generally marketed as soft forks, from a technical perspective there is no difference between these and a proper soft fork. If you give me an hour, I can soft fork bitcoin cash. All I need to do is make up a silly rule, tell the miners to follow it (regardless of whether they actually listen or not) and you have a soft fork.


You should probably stop saying that bitcoin is no longer bitcoin because of segwit. If you want to say that bitcoin cash it bitcoin because it's better. Yeah, well that's just like your opinion, man. But at least it's an opinion that works from a technical standpoint and 'segwit bwahaha' and 'muh whitepaper' does not.

"**RAS syndrome**

RAS syndrome (where ""RAS"" stands for ""redundant acronym syndrome"", making the phrase ""RAS syndrome"" humorously self-referential) refers to the use of one or more of the words that make up an acronym or other initialism in conjunction with the abbreviated form, thus in effect repeating one or more words.

Two common examples are ""PIN (or VIN) number"" (the ""N"" in PIN and VIN stands for ""number"") and ""ATM machine"" (the ""M"" in ATM stands for ""machine""). The term RAS syndrome was coined in 2001 by New Scientist.

A person is humorously said to suffer from RAS syndrome when they redundantly use one or more of the words that make up an acronym or initialism with the abbreviation itself.

"Not OP, and really not gonna comment on the technological merits of the BTC v. BCH argument. 

BUT... if someone were to “think critically,” as you so eloquently put it, at this tweet, then they would be drawn to a couple questions. The first being, okay are there Bitcoin (BTC) or Bitcoin Cash (BCH) ATMs being added/bought/etc.? Then your critical thinking skills would bring you to the conclusion that it is BCH support being added to ATMs. Then thinking critically would bring you to the next question? “Okay.. if BCH support is being added, why is he calling it ‘Bitcoin’?” And critical thinking would bring you assume that there is some potential gain on misleading and misdirecting the population. After all, factually speaking, BCH is not “Bitcoin,” so even if you try the “BCH keeps the original vision of bitcoin, therefor it is the true bitcoin,” you are factually wrong. 

Critical thinking brings us to say that there is something disingenuous going on within the BCH camp in an attempt to falsely brand Bitcoin Cash as “Bitcoin.” That’s my gripe with Bitcoin Cash.

There currently no decentralized way for businesses to accept crypto but get paid in dollars. It's still a necessary step on the road to adoption though. Allowing users to spend crypto will grow adoption, transaction volume, and market cap. This will in turn reduce volatility, and eventually merchants will be comfortable getting PAID in crypto, rather than just receiving crypto but getting paid in cash. But while merchants still want fiat a centralized payment processor is the only possible choice because that's how /fiat/ works.;1;0;False;Twoehy;du71pm1;Coinbase Launches PayPal-Like Service for Paying Merchants with BCH, ETH, LTC & BTC;7wnf9c;https://www.trustnodes.com/2018/02/10/coinbase-launches-paypal-like-plugging-ethereum-bitcoin-bitcoin-cash-litecoin/
"Hear hear! I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed but despite that-  to me it's absolutely intuitive that enabling value add services directly on, or interfacing with the bitcoin blockchain is *vastly* superior to the reality in which this innovation is forced to migrate towards an alternate chain.

 Some core devs disagreed, and to this day still seem to uphold their hostile barricading as being the right thing to do despite the fact it's plain as day to see the end result is a drastic dilution in market cap, mind-share and there's no reason to think that isn't going to become increasingly apparent as time goes on. And then they have the gall to disparage vitalik as having been largely swayed to not building on btc by money, which true or not is a bit rich coming from those who seemingly demolished and evicted the properties of those who built on bitcoin as 'not up to code' in order to surreptiously build their shiny blockstream offices instead. 

It really defies all logic. Regardless of what % of things built on top of ethereum are really worth what they're claimed to be worth by the market or not it's obvious opening up avenues for people to build on top of the blockchain foundation and not just restricting it to being a poor currency or an interesting store of value increases the overall utility and opens a whole bunch of new use cases. 

it's quite funny to see recent comments like this from gmaxwell, when not long earlier he'd *totally* denounced the concept of having fiat represented on the blockchain as being a pervese idea

The general hivemind however seems to be waking up to the reality now that '2nd layer' solutions are important, which is a good thing.

I'm curious, obviously you haven't got a crystal ball but given that there seems to be numerous CIP's already merged and various solutions (bips) towards lowering the cost of tx, improving the speed etc-- that are in theory beneficial to counterparty in whatever scope they can be implented what do you think of the future of projects like counterparty? Omni primarily has tether going for it, coinprism is shutting down soon and i hate to see this happen to counterparty too, but beyond donating and trying to raise awareness and integrate I don't know much else to do. 

 do you think it'll fade away into obscurity like, namecoin, primecoin, etc or be able to be revived? I really feel that however great it was that the projected started on a pure and altruistic note- ethereum and blockstream showed that money talks. Can you think of anything that needs to happen/would help keep counterparty moving forward? 

 I noticed there was a recent announcement of a fork, but frankly I feel as if the visions of the announcer isn't aligned with supporting either counterparty, or bitcoin and they're really going after that $5 mill token prize money and trying to essentially get 'grants' from the likes of CSW and Ver.

"Basically, the *existence* of XCP at a time when launching a new altcoin was considered a *heretical act* sunk Counterparty moreso than any other factor.

But hindsight is 20/20, and looking back on it all things considered the XCP ""altcoin"" was in fact a *godsend* for Bitcoin, and its initial proof of burn based distribution method was downright *angelical* compared to the rabidly unethical ICO market which followed in the wake of XCP's virtual destruction.

As a technology, Counterparty is backed by some of the earliest and most ardent Bitcoin supporters in the world; we who take issue with ICOs chiefly for tossing out egalitarian leadership principles in favor of instant megamillion paydays, backed Counterparty. We wanted to see one chain to rule them all, but alas. For all this, Counterparty has received no funding, little to no attention, and a bunch of *completely undeserved* hate.

Greg Maxwell and the usual suspects are directly to blame for the *unthinkable* brand damage Ethereum dished out to Bitcoin; their hubris and greed sunk the Bitcoin ecosystem's marketshare to all-time lows, and it's high time someone proves to the world how Counterparty.io stands to equalize the playing field.";2;1;False;insette;du5tdpo;Vitalik Buterin tried to develop Ethereum on top of Bitcoin, but was stalled because the developers made it hard to build on top of Bitcoin.
