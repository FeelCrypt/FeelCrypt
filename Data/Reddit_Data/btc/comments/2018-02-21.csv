Yes, but the underlying Ethereum network is still reliant upon PoW transaction verification.

"Right, it was for about six years; which is a couple years. I suppose it’s subjective to every person as to what “a couple” means. Crypto has been around for about ten years; additionally, it’s several times smaller in market capitalization, and has a global pool of investors to draw from, whereas the dot.com bubble had mainly US investors and wealthy foreign investors to draw from. 

A significant portion of these companies during the dot.com bubble had no underlying utility; and/or were corrupt. Take WorldCom for example. An accounting scandal is what eventually took them down; in addition to poor product rollouts. 

Crypto has the Blockchain technology, which has had ten years to be scrutinized, chopped up, and reviewed. It’s proven itself to be a valuable technology; and innovators are improving upon it and pushing forward their own superior versions of Blockchain technology every day. 

There are similarities, but there are staunch differences in these two industries as well. Differences that may ensure the survival of one while allowing for the collapse of another. ";-2;5;False;Dustin_Bromain;dul790h;Bitcoin is a bubble...;https://i.redd.it/dvcdsxk1fih01.png

"Let me put it in perspective: the US dollar is the business currency of the world, millions of Americans use it every day as well as some of the largest corporations. Bitcoin (even all crypto combined) doesn't even come close to being as used and widespread as the US dollar however Bitcoin and many other cryptos have a higher value than the dollar. The value of currency is based on how much of the currency is circulated in an economy and demand and supply, however, this alone cannot justify the value of a currency. For fiat, its value can be attributed to a number of factors such as GDP, inflation, unemployment etc. For Bitcoin and other crypto, the value is only there because people see it as an investment opportunity. There is high demand because of returns people have been getting which in turn is causing an uptick in the value, causing people to make more money which increases demand further. It's a positive feedback loop but without any actual use behind it the bubble is bound to burst. The value of Bitcoin has been kept high artificially by a limited supply of coins and an algorithm which determines how hard it is to mine a coin but this value is not backed up by real life usage. 
You say that people trade currencies for profit but their trades are based on real life factors which determines the value of the currency. 
Stocks also have their value backed up by a number of real life factors such as profitability, amount of dividends paid, the quality of the products or services they offer etc. Bitcoin only has the code to keep it from devaluing but there is nothing tangible to back up that maintained value. 
I must end by saying that I do invest in crypto and I've made quite good returns on it so I'm definitely not a crypto hater. Furthermore, this comment is mostly about Bitcoin and I do acknowledge that there are other cryptocurrencies which can outperform Bitcoin in usefulness and take the lead down the line. I also think that blockchain is here to stay and it's an extremely powerful tool. 
All that being said, it is important to realise that there is a bubble there and that it could burst anytime. ";11;0;False;Ced26;dulaag2;Bitcoin is a bubble...;https://i.redd.it/dvcdsxk1fih01.png

"From my perspective, working on one of the small dotCom projects late-1999 to 2001, reality set in; hardware, software and the internet wasn't ready.

There were a lot of lofty goals but the infrastructure wasn't there. A majority of users were not yet connected or still had modems, DSL and cable deployment were in full swing, but data rates were no where near the demanded expectations. There were rumors of Enron rolling out fiber optics in some luxury subdivision in southern California.

That was the last mile, but then there was the server-side first mile. Costs were prohibitive for large ""pipes"" with any amount of volume. We were working on content delivery (pre-Netflix streaming). For a craptastic over-compress VHS (VCD) quality video of less than 600MB would cost nearly $10 in bandwidth. It was cheaper to walk to the video store.

The software wasn't ready. Go back and look at the condition of browsers and Flash plugins. At the time, Amazon was pouring huge bank into infrastructure, not just for themselves, but to solve the on-line hosting problems in general.

Hardward wasn't ready. The 1GHz CPU just broke on the market. 35GB HD was expensive. We built a couple of custom video capture stations, each with a  360GB SCSI 10-disk RAID that cost $7K each. The costs for the required growth quickly outpaced the investment dollars. I remember the company had mission critical equipment on order for months and some arrived only a week before the company shuttered.

I would also mention the litigious atmosphere didn't help. It was a huge land grab for intellectual property. It was more about what you couldn't do than you could do. A lot of cool tech was getting locked up in pending patents. Whichever direction you took your project, you were apt to step on a patent landmine. Likewise, projects had self inflicted wounds, as project managers had unreasonable edicts to develop proprietary implementations, only to loose site of their specific goals.

Then there were the crazy salaries. Weekly we would hear stories of how one company had poached the project lead or other executive from another company. This alone derailed many of the smaller start-ups. ";4;0;False;bitmeister;dum2270;Bitcoin is a bubble...;https://i.redd.it/dvcdsxk1fih01.png

"Sorry, but we are in a bubble right now.  

People seem to believe that calling the current state of crypto a ""bubble"" (which it is), means that you are saying that crypto is worthless, however, this is not true at all.  Speculative bubbles can occur even when the underlying asset class has some value or even potential for great value.

The dotcom bubble is a fantastic corollary.  In the late 1990s and early 2000s, people believed that the internet was going to change the world overnight and that all dotcom companies would be worth billions.  They were right -- the internet has certainly changed the world and many dotcom companies today are worth incredible sums, but their timing was off.  The unfortunate reality, was that the technology was not yet ready to meet the expectations.

Crypto will too change the world, but again, it will not happen overnight.  The technology is not ready to go mainstream, and once people realize this, the prices of crypto will fall spectacularly.  The crash has only just begun, and it is going to be a long painful journey until we reach the bottom.  But do not fear, crypto has a tremendous future.

That's the same things that'll happen when the crypto bubble bursts, only a couple coins with underlying utility will survive and the rest will cause huge losses for their investors.

It's artificially not allowed to die yet: as soon as it dips hard, exchanges go offline ""due to high traffic"", mempool clogs and nobody can even sell. There's also the very unique feature that Bitcoin is not limited to ""investors"" but everyone can enter, thisis also coupled with a ""buy the dip"" religion; as soon as the dumb money realizes their mistakes and gets out, more and dumber money rushes in dreaming of lambos. The more this cycle continues, the more people think of this events as ""corrections"" instead of the unmistakable signs that a giant bubble is forming.

"The dot.com bubble had a massive run up over a timespan of a couple years and then imploded; with the industry never fully recovering. Many companies went out of business, and countless investors lost all of their risked capital. 

Cryptos have been around for a little over ten years now, and have had successive periods of run-ups and corrections. For every historical correction (with the exception of the most recent January correction), investors could have eventually recouped their losses if they had held their investments; even if they had bought at the peak of every run-up. That fact is mostly unparalleled in traditional markets. No one that invested in failed start-ups during the dot.com bubble ever regained their money. 

There have been corrections where Bitcoin lost 90% of its value. If it was going to die, it would have died then. 

Cryptos are only going to continue to grow and prosper as we steadily march into the future. Even if Bitcoin itself dies, other currencies will take its place. Amazon was a fledgling online book seller that barely survived the dot.com bubble; but because of its underlying utility and its ability to be innovative, it survived to become the corporate behemoth that you see today. 

There appears to be an infinite number of ways that crypto currencies can provide utility and return on investments to individual investors, businesses, and governments. As the true potential of crypto currencies is starting to be revealed to the masses, the number of well-funded, innovative ICO’s continues to grow at truly incredible rates. 

And if you don’t believe me, then I encourage you to do your own research and come to your own conclusions. You might just find that it’s an investment worth looking into.

Maybe you're right, but users have now proved to have a stake in decision making by way of 'striking'. A network is no good without users, the mining difficulty will adjust. It would have beeen interesting in the event of a contentious split to see what the market said. The way I remember it, Nick Szabo (the most likely Satoshi) tweeted no2x, and within an hour 2x was called off. Scaling on chain is a minority opinion among experts as far as I'm concerned. Miners got a cautious blocksize increase anyway, as well as a malleability fix.

"Dude, that's not at all what happened. Miners clearly wanted (and IMO STILL want) a much larger block size. You (and probably all Core/X/whatever supporters) seem to be able to explain events in a favorable light for your side no matter what happens. Again, as I said we recently saw the chaos a constricted block size caused when fees spiked over $30 each. There is only relief now because people stopped making all BTC txs except ones they have no choice to make. The truth is people are locked into BTC because it has had YEARS to be woven into systems. Even I myself have been forced to use it when I didn't want to because no other options were yet available from providers I used. But that is changing. Slowly but surely. 

Miners are *heavily* invested in SHA256 equipment. They have no desire to lose on that investment. That means if BTC or BCH or whatever they can mine keeps them profitable that's what they will follow. I has nothing to do with ""humbly excepting 'experts' advice"". It's simply reality: The events of the block size ultimatum played out as no one could predict, but one could reasonably expect. Remember Core first believed the community would quickly adopt SegWit with over 95% support. That was obviously not the case and only a weird renege deal got it activated. Bitcoin Cash also proved Core glaringly wrong on at least two counts: that a HF would be unreasonably dangerous, and mining over a 1-2MB block would likely cause everything to explode. Miners are now just trying to stay profitable and watch/support whatever currency gets most marketshare going forward.

"Maybe you should re-read the whole whitepaper?

Here's a sample:

>7.**Reclaiming Disk Space**

>Once the latest transaction in a coin is buried under enough blocks, the spent transactions before it can be discarded to save disk space. To facilitate this without breaking the block's hash, transactions are hashed in a Merkle Tree [7][2][5], with only the root included in the block's hash. Old blocks can then be compacted by stubbing off branches of the tree. The interior hashes do not need to be stored.

>A block header with no transactions would be about 80 bytes. If we suppose blocks are generated every 10 minutes, 80 bytes * 6 * 24 * 365 = 4.2MB per year. With computer systems typically selling with 2GB of RAM as of 2008, and Moore's Law predicting current growth of 1.2GB per year, storage should not be a problem even if the block headers must be kept in memory.

>7.**Reclaiming Disk Space**

>Once the latest transaction in a coin is buried under enough blocks, the spent transactions before it can be discarded to save disk space. To facilitate this without breaking the block's hash, transactions are hashed in a Merkle Tree [7][2][5], with only the root included in the block's hash. Old blocks can then be compacted by stubbing off branches of the tree. The interior hashes do not need to be stored.

>A block header with no transactions would be about 80 bytes. If we suppose blocks are generated every 10 minutes, 80 bytes * 6 * 24 * 365 = 4.2MB per year. With computer systems typically selling with 2GB of RAM as of 2008, and Moore's Law predicting current growth of 1.2GB per year, storage should not be a problem even if the block headers must be kept in memory.

"> Why would you assume that only Bob will route payments, but not Alice:

Yes, if Alice has more than one payment channel, she can shuffle clearance between those channels, up to their original funding limits, by routing multihop payments, or by making a circular LN payment to herself (out through one channel, in through another).

However, if she saves $2000 of all her LN income every week, the sum of the inbound clearances of all her channels will decrease by $2000 every week.  If the total inbound funding of those channels was $10'000, then the same example above will remain valid -- only that the numbers are her total inbound clearance, instead of just the  Bob->Alice one.

In particlual, if the sum of all her inbound clearances is less than $5000, she cannot receive $5000 through the LN -- no matter how she rebalances the channels or splits the payment into separate payments.";1;1;False;jstolfi;dukjne2;Rick Falkvinge on the Lightning Network: Requirement to have private keys online, routing doesn't work, legal liability for nodes, and reactive mesh security doesn't work;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFZOrtlQXWc

Thanks, that's a useful simplification to think about instead of n channels (esp. assuming multipath payment [AMP] will work).

> In particlual, if the sum of all her inbound clearances is less than $5000, she cannot receive $5000 through the LN -- no matter how she rebalances the channels or splits the payment into separate payments.

Yes, although AMP will relax the current constraint that in order to receive a one-time $5000 payment you'd need at least one channel with at least that inbound clearance.

But I think this is a well communicated constraint and probably the most talked about drawback (that the funds one is about to receive have to be locked up beforehand by the other party).";2;0;False;BitcoinSatellite;duklvlk;Rick Falkvinge on the Lightning Network: Requirement to have private keys online, routing doesn't work, legal liability for nodes, and reactive mesh security doesn't work;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFZOrtlQXWc
