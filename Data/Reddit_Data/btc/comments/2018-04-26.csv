"In the store-of-value scenario, people buy when they expect the value to go up, and the value only goes up if *more* people buy. At some point, nobody else will want to buy and it will crash. That is how a pyramid scheme works and it will have the same result.

In the medium-of-exchange scenario, people are constantly buying or exchanging, and the price is supported by its use. That is how money works. It is sustainable.
