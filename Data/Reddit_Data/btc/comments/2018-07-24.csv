Two things. First legalizing drugs leads to less ODing (see Portugal) as the product becomes more standardized. So when you put people in jail and criminalize drugs you sentence more families to suffer lost loved ones.

Secondly you believe your a victim if your family member does something you don't like and dies from it? Suffering, yes but not the vicim. The dead person is the victim.

I'm just saying that there could be a valid argument in that running a large scale drug market is harming people.

"> does that make it wrong to agree that people who facilitate the millions in illegal drug trafficking should be given harsher sentences? 

Yes it does. Illegality is suppose to be based off a common set of acceptable behavior. If significant portions of your population are engaging in something illegal (that has no victim) that thing likely shouldn't be illegal. 

You shouldn't have gotten life for running a trucking company that sometimes carried liquor in 1927. You shouldn't get life for running a website that sometimes facilitated dime bags sales in 2017.

"Not today's value, but when the complaint was filed in 2013.  Your argument still partially stands because there was huge price growth during that time, but it is likewise argued that SilkRoad drove that price increase.  After it closed, bitcoin collapsed.  

When SR started it went as low as a $1.  When Ross was arrested it was topping $300 and very shortly after went to over 1k.  We can reasonably assume that SR's business increased as time went on and the bulk of the transactions were when bitcoin's pricing was higher as opposed to lower.  I would be interested to know a better estimate of total amounts.

All this said, George Jung trafficked a lot more cocaine than 200M, so maybe you'll see Ross only get 20 years like he did.

The complaint published when Ulbricht was arrested included information the FBI gained from a system image of the Silk Road server collected on 23 July 2013. It noted that, ""From February 6, 2011 to July 23, 2013 there were approximately 1,229,465 transactions completed on the site. The total revenue generated from these sales was 9,519,664 Bitcoins, and the total commissions collected by Silk Road from the sales amounted to 614,305 Bitcoins.

Who are his victims, though?  To put someone in prison for life, I would think that he must have really hurt people.
