I'm in favor of Bitcoin as a currency and also against speculation. It's what causes volatility. The speculation hypes are also the reason why fees explode sometimes. (see bitinfocharts.com) Both is at their own cost.;1;0;False;nymou;dx8vei6;Seems relevant today;https://v.redd.it/j5wp0b9rysd01

">Charging extra fees for specific uses may not be fair and if so they can’t do it. 

But wouldn't you know that according to what the regulation says? If it isn't readily understandable what constitutes a violation it makes for very poor law.

>One of the main tenets of regulation is to treat customers fairly.

Do you have a specific regulation which cites such an arbitrary stipulation?  I think you opened with the argument that it would violate a regulation or license, and then went to ""it wouldn't be fair"" but there has to be more to what you're saying. Ultimately though I don't see it as a good argument countering the idea that you should be free to charge what you want, just as you are free not to engage in such a contract.
