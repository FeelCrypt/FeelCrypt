"The main problem with the fork, for the scalable side, is that blocks under 1Mb would still be considered valid. So if the old chain holds a majority of the hash power, they would keep overriding the new chain with <1Mb blocks.

By adding any simple thing like a salt to the block hash we could render blocks on the different chains incompatible. The blocks from the old chain would be rejected in the new one. And this change could be done without rendering mining equipment obsolete, as the mining algorithm would still be the same.";5;3;False;caveden;czvyfll;"Brian Armstrong on Twitter: ""Coinbase is now running BitcoinClassic!

"Coinbase just doesn't understand. They don't understand that it is impossible that they could ever be as intelligent as Greg Maxwell or LukeJr. These men are pioneers of industry, and now rogue groups want to bastardize and steal their hard work. I mean, they created bitcoin, didn't they?

I mean yes, they have stated that larger blocks will lead to mining centralization and that it will harm Chinese miners due to the Great Firewall™ while claiming mining centralization in China is a problem, but that is neither here nor there. 

If only everyone would just sit back, relax, and let the [professionals](http://thelibertarianrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/potuses-laughing.jpg) handle this most delicate and complex situation of changing one line of code, we will all soon be shown how [gracefully a soft fork integration of non-vaporware Lightning can be.](http://i.imgur.com/xU12HZF.gifv)

"Coinbase, Bitpay and other large companies need to man up. Their business model cannot survive long term if Blockstream prevents a fork from happening.

You do not need to wait for miners. You hold the economic majority, and most holders are on your side. Do the fork, add an extra salt or anything similar to the block hash so that even with a minority of hash power the scalable chain remains alive. And set up a market for coins where people can exchange old for new coins. If Coinbase, Bitpay and Circle alone exchange the entirety of their wallets, that would give a tremendous price advantage to the new coin, what would eventually bring miners in.

Of course that will be chaotic, but we need to divorce from Core. Their vision for Bitcoin is not the same of those who have been onboard for years, and is incompatible with the business models of the major Bitcoin companies.
