That's a secondary exchange.  The USD goes into Kraken and out to your counterparty.  USD is not sent to Tether for depositing.  ;1;1;False;_dredge;dmwjlqk;As 20m more Tether are issued today, I think it's important for people to know that an unbacked Tether could be a big reason for the recent bitcoin price rise.

The market cap of USDT is 340mil. Even if USDT turns out to be a complete scam. Deduct 340mil from BTC market cap of 66billion.
