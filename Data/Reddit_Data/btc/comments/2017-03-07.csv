I guess I don't, fully.  I thought the fees were capped at either ""normal"" or ""priority"", or associated with just the amount being spent at time of transaction.  I was not aware the fees are calculated based on previous number of deposits/amounts to the spending wallet.  Assuming I understood your breakdown.

"I'm not sure you understand how fees work in bitcoin. They are charged per byte in the transaction. If you transaction has a lot of inputs because you are spending from an address which has received lots of small transactions, you will have to pay a lot because the resulting transaction will be large.

So if someone had had a donations address setup for the last 4 years, which has 1,000 1mbtc inputs (1BTC total) because 1,000 people have sent a dollar to it, to spend that the transaction needs to have 1,000 inputs and would be very large, and hence very expensive.

It would be like your gum-ball machine saying 'You cant use 5x 10c coins, you have to use 1x50c coin'.

Hence, before mining 2MB-blocks it's really paramount that we have not only a small majority of the miners behind it, but sufficient support (both among the miners and the rest of the community) that the miners would feel confident in mining 2 MB blocks.

By adding such a fail-safe flag, we'd efficiently be flagging both that we're not 100% confident in BU, and also that we're considering a 1MB-chain as legitimate.

"> if they want to be the dominant fork of BTC, they need at least 50.00000000000000000...1%,

I think one would need ~55% hashing power to be 50% certain that the big-block-chain would survive after first attempt on a chain-split, due to random-walk and an asymmetry.

If a big block is mined, and half of the network does not recognize it as a valid block, the chain is split.  If the small-block-chain ever outgrows the big-block-chain (which is likely to happen during the first few blocks) the big-block-chain will be abandoned by everyone.  This is asymmetric as the smallblockers will never accept the bigblock-chain.

Since 50% probability isn't good enough and since most actors don't want a split causing two competing bitcoins to be around, there won't be any split without at least 75% of the mining power supports bigger blocks.

> The long answer is that they could just as easily fork off right now,

No, with the current BU-logic, it's impossible to fork off a ""bigblock-network"" without having a hashing majority.  As soon as a BU miner observes that the smallblock-chain is longer, it will abandon the bigblock-chain.  There has been talks about modifying the software so that it's possible to do a minority-fork ... but this minority-fork wouldn't be bitcoin, it would be an altcoin, and since there are already hundreds of altcoins to choose between it doesn't make much sense to create yet another altcoin.

"> The Blockstream/SegWit/LN fork will be worth LESS: SegWit uses 4MB storage/bandwidth to provide a one-time bump to 1.7MB blocksize; messy, less-safe as softfork; LN=vaporware. The BU fork will be worth MORE: single clean safe hardfork solving blocksize forever; on-chain; fix malleability separately.

"Adding all the pools that vote for BU and their hasrate the past 7 days should give the BU supporting pools a 38.51% hashrate right now (including 22.5% of slush since 22.5% of the hashrate of slush pool is voting BU).

Will be very interesting to see if and when Core intends to take some action. They have badly lost the initiative by now and will probably have to go to some lengths to regain it. Maybe some hardfork code could to the trick, but then again that would probably upset their base. And since the base is almost all they have left they are probably not inclined to go that route.

"That's a very interesting question, and the answer is complicated, but the short version is, if they want to be the dominant fork of BTC, they need at least 50.00000000000000000...1%, and the more they have beyond that, the better.

The long answer is that they could just as easily fork off right now, but they would be the minority if they did. This isn't ideal, as it would most likely mean a large amount of turbulence and potentially large financial damage to bitcoin as a whole.

It's also not great to try to fork with only a simple majority, as the minority fork could choose to continue operation, which would lead to the tumult previously described.

The ideal situation would be for 100% of miners to agree to BU, before the fork, but realistically, that's never going to happen.

A hard fork was significantly easier in the past, and will be significantly more difficult to activate in the future, as bitcoin grows and becomes more integrated in more peoples' systems and various use cases.

The main reason the HF to BU has been so difficult and slow and contentious has not primarily been from any conspiracy by blockstream (even if such exists) or because of Theymos' censorship (which just produced a Streissand effect anyway).

You and I may not agree with them, but a lot of people genuinely do not think that removing the block size cap is safe (or would produce, for them, unacceptable centralization pressure)...and there is absolutely an inherent coordination problem to getting thousands of independent and decentralized users and nodes and miners and merchants and blockchain services to agree on anything and activate it at high levels of consensus, even if it wasn't a disputed or contentious change being proposed.

"Slush only has about 6.4% of the network hasrate, so I don't see them having that large of an impact. 

It is my understanding that somewhere in the range of 23% of the network (as of yesterday) was signaling for BU support, AntPool and BTC.com collectively have about 20% of the network hashrate, so a total of about 43% of the network is theoretically signaling for BU support. 

If many of the smaller pools were to start signaling BU support in masse, then I would peg the chances of BU 'activating' to be quite high.

A really neat aspect to this is the minority hash chain would have several advantages in this trading. First advantage is the original coin would have 25% or less hashpower therefore it will be easier to transfer the BUforkcoin to an exchange. BU supporters wanting to dump their original btc on exchanges will have to wait for seriously delayed confirmations while the original chain supporters will be able to get quicker confirmations to quickly devastate the price of BUforkcoin. BU miners will lose a lot of money here. ;1;1;False;bitusher;dem6znq;AntPool signals for Bitcoin Unlimited;5xv0at;https://www.blocktrail.com/BTC/block/00000000000000000204cd2c9840023f1434f3dcdd7f471e4b8c8638d14d7006

That is incredibly dependent on the level of consensus reached prior to the fork. If more than 70 or 80% of the hashing power sides with BU, I really don't see the fork driven price drop being very large at all.

It would be best to wait for some reasonable grace period after 75% is achieved. This would give other miners and pools, exchanges, and users the chance to upgrade.
