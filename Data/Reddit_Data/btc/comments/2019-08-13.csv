You don't find it disingenuous for r\bitcoin to say that they only allow Bitcoin discussion, but they regularly allow discussion of non-Bitcoin things?  This particular instance was particularly bad because it was literally posted by a corporate Blockstream account.  This was effectively **a commercial advertisement** on r\bitcoin for a service that has nothing to do with Bitcoin.  I reported it, but the mods chose to ignore the report and allowed it to stay up.
