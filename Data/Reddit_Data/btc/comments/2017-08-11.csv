"I'll try my hand at answers to some of these.

>What are transaction maleability/quadratic hashing, why are small blockers so concerned with the two (and always both brought up side by side)?

Transaction malleability is changing the format of a transaction to give it a different ID.  It really only impacts transactions before they are confirmed (0-conf).  It can be used in several ways to fool people into thinking a transaction did / did not confirm.  Most of bitcoin is based on not trusting 0-conf transactions in any case (and most online retail or exchanges require several confirmations because of that.).

Quadratic hashing is the idea that the time it takes a computer to verify a transaction increase MORE than linearly with the number of transaction signatures.   Computers do this way faster, but using numbers easier to understand.  A normal transaction will have one or two normal inputs that would take 1 or two seconds to verify.  With multisig or with a transaction that has several inputs, this could get exponentially long with current transaction formats.  10 input transactions could take 100 seconds to verify.  As multisig is more popular and as a broader userbase inherently increases transaction complexity, a combination of larger blocks and a very complex transaction could lead to problems with the time it takes to validate a block.  SegWit and other techniques allow for one signature is ~1 second no matter how many of them there are.

"> What's the definition of a second-layer solution, and does Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 141 meet that definition? Or does it fall in a different category?> 

BIP141 (SegWit) isn't a second layer solution, but makes some modifications to bitcoin that enables (or makes it easier for) second layer solutions.  A ""second layer"" is another set of software (maybe running alongside Bitcoin) that handles transactions - generally thought of as higher volume and lower value transactions.  There are several proposals that use different methods for creating a second layer to interact with Bitcoin as a base / validation layer.

First off, I've never really heard anyone describe how much security is enough.  How much incentive do they need?  In any case, the idea is that transaction fees will do this someday before the year 2140 (when we do, in-fact reach the 21 million cap).  The combination of increased value of each bitcoin, increased transactions on the bitcoin network, and a fee / transaction will give miners reason to keep mining.  That's a long time away.

For comparison, in ~2044 the block reward will be down to 0.1 btc/block.  In 27 years, bitcoin value could go up to $437,000/btc (it's 27 years, who knows) to offset the decrease in block reward.

"> What does Segwit actually do? Only info on that I've seen here is ""it make bitcoin bad""

Segwit does a few complicated things that are difficult to explain to newcomers, but I will try to explain them as simply as I can.

It removes the signatures from transactions. Think of bitcoin transacitons as writing a check. Usually we write someones name on a check, but we could write 'cash' instead allowing anyone to spend it. Segwit transactions are checks that are made out to cash with a piece of paper stapled to the check outlining who can spend it. All of the miners have agreed to collude and honor that stapled piece of paper even though the rules of Bitcoin do not recognize that piece of paper having any authority. If that sounds complicated then you understand why many people are against segwit. It is unnecessarily complicated.

So why would anyone want Segwit? That also is complicated. Lets start with some basic terms.

All checks have a check number on them, and Bitcoin isn't any different. Bitcoin transactions have a hash associated which is like it's check number. In Bitcoin, this check number can be changed by anyone, and doing so causes some minor problems. These problems are nothing more then a nuisance for the average user, but it is also preventing people from using a lightning network.

Every time you send a bitcoin transaction it is permanently added to the blockchain. This record must be stored forever and as a result has a cost associated with it. This cost is currently approximately $1 per transaction. The lightning network is a method of bundling many transactions into one so a user can save money. 

So, Segwit removes transaction mallebility which will enable the lightning network which will allow cheaper fees.

Segwit, however, isn't the only solution to transaction malleability.";9;0;False;SharpMud;dlhrees;This community is a nightmare for new users;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6t1ttt/this_community_is_a_nightmare_for_new_users/

2. ""Can we get an acronym master list with short definitions for things?""

2. Wish I could help here but you are probably going to have to do what all of us did, just study until you figure it out. 

3. ""What are transaction maleability/quadratic hashing, why are small blockers so concerned with the two (and always both brought up side by side)?""

3. TM and QH are two minor imperfections in the Bitcoin Network. Solving these issues right now is by no means crucial for the functioning of bitcoin, but L2 won't work without, so that's why they make such a big deal out of it. They need it to push the L2 onto us. 

4. ""Who are these people everyone speaks of?""

4. Jihan Wu is the owner of the biggest mining equipment manufacturer, a big blocker, he gets slandered all the time but there is nothing really bad about him.

5. ""What's the definition of a second-layer solution, and does Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 141 meet that definition""

5. A second layer solution is a network built on TOP of bitcoin. You can transact back and forth on a ledger, but the final balances don't get settled until you perform an on chain transaction. Think of it like a paypal account, based on bitcoin, backed by bitcoin (so they say.)

6.What's the long-term plan for incentivizing miners to mine?

6. Transaction fees. 

7. ""How fucked are we when some guys at MIT build the first mostly-functional quantum computer? Will we have plenty of time to prepare before that day arrives?""

7. Not fucked at all, yes we can make minor changes to prevent this, but it probably won't be necessary for a long time. Bitcoin is extremely cryptographically secure. It is something like a million times the combined computing power of the whole world to crack a BIP38 encryption. 

8. ""Why did Satoshi disappear?""

8. Either he's already dead, or he disappeared for his own safety. Think about what he did. 

9. ""Why is China so involved in cryptocurrency?"" Most mining equipment is made there, they have a lot of cheap hydroelectricity, the government gives subsidies to bitcoin miners (not 100% sure about this though) and think about the chinese culture, bitcoin is good for them. Plus chinese government has restrictions on moving capital which pushes a lot of people to crypto. 

Hope this helps.

"> What does Segwit actually do? Only info on that I've seen here is ""it make bitcoin bad""

In the bitcoin white paper: https://bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf

>>We define an electronic coin as a chain of digital signatures. 

Segwit segregates the transaction signatures from teh transaction moving it outside the bitcoin blockchain, by removing the signature from the bitcoin transaction it makes for approximately 70% more space in a 1MB block. So if every one move to segwit type transactions we'll get an effective 70% increase in transaction capacity. 

There are security problems when removing signatures from bitcoin transactions. https://youtu.be/VoFb3mcxluY and a myriad of other problems if you want to discuss the economics.

"I'm only going to answer a couple right now cause I'm on my phone. 

>* What does Segwit actually do? Only info on that I've seen here is ""it make bitcoin bad""

Transaction malleability means you can't rely on the transaction identifier (txid) because it can be changed. This makes chaining txs together impossible. 

Segwit fixes this bug. That's the main objective. By fixing this bug, we make decentralized networks of bidirectional payment channels capable (lightning network). 

Personally, I believe that the future is in the Lightning Network. It will enable instant transactions and unlimited scale, all backed by the security of the Bitcoin blockchain. This is the only conceivable way we get 7 billion daily bitcoin users.

Segwit also opens up the door for script versioning, which allows future script upgrades, signature aggregation (massive reduction in tx size), and actual privacy at the protocol level. Today, bitcoin's privacy features suck. Segwit is a step towards fixing that.

"> Why did Satoshi disappear?

Etherium, another cryptocurrency, had millions of dollars stolen last year. The developers decided to step in and steal the money back. They did this by changing the code to move the money back to the previous owners. The real problem is not that they did do this, but rather they could. In this instance they took money that was stolen, but they could have just as easily taking money that was legitimately earned. If Satoshi stuck around he would have similar power over the ecosystem of Bitcoin. It is very likely he realized that no man or group should wield that kind of power, and Bitcoin would be better off without him.

"> Who are these people everyone speaks of? I feel like I need a master roster. How can a new person care what Jihan Wu says if they have no idea who he is or why what he says is important?

Bitcoin Core is a group of Developers. The most vocal ones are LukeJr and NullC (Greg Maxwell). Both of them seem to think they own Bitcoin and should be allowed to decide what Bitcoin is and isn't. They have mentioned several times that Bitcoin cannot be changed without their approval. Clearly good developers, but really need a big reality check

Blockstream is a company that pays, either directly or indirectly, many of the Bitcoin Developers. They created Segwit and have been attempting to bully everyone into accepting the changes that they approve and rejecting changes they do not approve. They are actively against any blocksize increase.

Roger Ver, aka Bitcoin Jesus, is an early adopter. He started mining bitcoins early on and is likely a multimillionaire because of this. You do not need to care what he thinks, but he is an expert in the field so you could learn from listening to him. He has been spending his time promoting Bitcoin and is a big block supporter. Blockstream sees Roger as a threat and started a smear campaign against him. You will see some major hate towards him on r/bitcoin.

Jihan Wu is a miner. You should absolutely care what he thinks because he is a voting member of Bitcoin. What that means is his mining machines are voting over which transactions make it into the blockchain, and in what order. He is also voting on what protocol changes are being made. In Bitcoin only miners are given a vote, however, they must still serve the population. They get paid in Bitcoin and acting poorly will cause the price of Bitcoin to fall.

>What does Segwit actually do? Only info on that I've seen here is ""it make bitcoin bad""

Alters incentive structure of bitcoin, changes the way signatures are stored, completely disrespects the white paper, which is what we invested in.

>Can we get an acronym master list with short definitions for things?

Wish I could help here but you are probably going to have to do what all of us did, just study until you figure it out.

>What are transaction maleability/quadratic hashing, why are small blockers so concerned with the two (and always both brought up side by side)?

TM and QH are two minor imperfections in the Bitcoin Network. Solving these issues right now is by no means crucial for the functioning of bitcoin, but L2 won't work without, so that's why they make such a big deal out of it. They need it to push the L2 onto us.

>Who are these people everyone speaks of?

Jihan Wu is the owner of the biggest mining equipment manufacturer, a big blocker, he gets slandered all the time but there is nothing really bad about him.

> What's the definition of a second-layer solution, and does Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 141 meet that definition

A second layer solution is a network built on TOP of bitcoin. You can transact back and forth on a ledger, but the final balances don't get settled until you perform an on chain transaction. Think of it like a paypal account, based on bitcoin, backed by bitcoin (so they say.)

>What's the long-term plan for incentivizing miners to mine?

Transaction fees.

>How fucked are we when some guys at MIT build the first mostly-functional quantum computer? Will we have plenty of time to prepare before that day arrives?

Not fucked at all, yes we can make minor changes to prevent this, but it probably won't be necessary for a long time. Bitcoin is extremely cryptographically secure. It is something like a million times the combined computing power of the whole world to crack a BIP38 encryption.

>Why did Satoshi disappear?

Either he's already dead, or he disappeared for his own safety. Think about what he did.

>Why is China so involved in cryptocurrency?

Most mining equipment is made there, they have a lot of cheap hydroelectricity, the government gives subsidies to bitcoin miners (not 100% sure about this though) and think about the chinese culture, bitcoin is good for them. Plus chinese government has restrictions on moving capital which pushes a lot of people to crypto.";22;3;False;ianpaschal;dlhfbr5;This community is a nightmare for new users;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6t1ttt/this_community_is_a_nightmare_for_new_users/

"u/anthson putting Transaction malleability in perspective:

Fixing malleability is like fixing your cat.

It's the owner that gets to define the problem and it's the cat that gets fixed. (The cat works just fine with it's manhood intact)

Malleable transaction haven't stopped Bitcoin from working. In fact malleable transactions prevent types of applications that move fee paying transactions off the Bitcoin network and onto other networks like the Lightning Network - resulting in less fees to pay for bitcoin security.

___


Malleability is associated with MtGox as being the reason people lost money, hence a bug. it doesn't look like a bug but more like a feature. Why is it something that needs to be fixed?

It's a feature that's preventing moving fee paying transactions off the blockchain, fees being a good thing that secure the blockchain as the subsidy diminishes.

Malleability is a behavior that encourages network participants using the network in other ways to have functions other than money confirm on the blockchain. Its functions should be defined and agreed before it's classified as something needing a fix, it's not a bug it's not harmed bitcoin, if anything it's been a scapegoat used to arguer fraud and that bitcoin is not broken and works for everyone, fix this and we fix fraud (NOT).

"At this time, BIP 141 and Segwit can really be thought of as the same thing.  (Segwit could be implemented in technically better methods, but the bitcoin community [at least everyone following the old chain which is the majority at this time] is in the process of implementing BIP141)

BIP141 has some theoretical / technical risks which could lead to loss of funds.  Bitcoin, as a whole, is not necessarily built around being technically impervious - rather it has incentives to make everyone cooperate because each segment of the system benefits from the system working.  So, some could argue that those risk are very theoretical (a majority of miners have to agree to BIP141 and then go back on their agreement).  We'll see.

BIP141 is largely called ""cancer"" because it's being supported by members of Blockstream.  Conspiracy theory being what it is...


[My personal opinions as a copy from a post on the same subject earlier this week](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6re0j5/why_are_you_people_acting_like_segwit_is_the/dl4cdmv/).  I was irritated at the time if that isn't obvious :)

* It's a solution to a problem I didn't care about.
* It's done with intentionally stupid accounting tricks to mask the real problem of immediate needs for onchain scaling - clouding the issue by trying to force one technical change to satisfy two requirements when it really doesn't.
* It encourages transaction sizes to increase and bloat the blockchain.
* It was implemented in a kludgy soft-fork mechanism  Both technically kludgy as well as politically kludgy by use of UASF.
* There's been discussion that Blockstream could have undisclosed patents around SegWit technology causing unknown complications with use in open source bitcoin software.
* SegWit has been promoted by Theymos and all of the censorship surrounding the venues he controls - why trust something that comes out of these channels?
* There are better alternative solutions to almost everything SegWit does.

"Reddit makes it easy to create new accounts. And that leads to all sorts of problems. It's easy to post meaningless or abusive one-liners and blow off steam, since one's real-life reputation is not affected.

However, Bitcoin does seem to attract a lot of toxic people relative to, say Ethereum, where the conversation tends to be much more level-headed. I'm not exactly sure why this is so. It might be that it's a top-down thing. If the people in charge (which has mostly been the Core developers so far, though that is changing now, thankfully) are toxic, that rubs off on the rest of us. 

By contrast, the people in charge of Ethereum seem to be much more civil, and that no doubt sets the tone for everybody else.

There is another, very important fork to come in November with SegWit2X.  Bitcoin Cash never stood any chance of being called ""Bitcoin"", but SegWit2X will very likely be called Bitcoin.  Unfortunately, Core are trying to prevent that from happening.  We can't just ignore them at this point.

Anyway, I agree with most of the rest, though I don't particularly support Bitcoin Cash as anything other than a fallback in case Core prevails over SegWit2X/BTC1 in November.

"In the tech area we have these discussions all day long. And I think you are partially right. At one specific point we must cover the ""high tech"" because the average joe is overstrained with all the complexity and it's a hurdle for beginners and non-tech people.

BUT (yeah, capslock) - Bitcoin or crypto currencies as whole are still a nerd experiment and we are in an early stage. I know 95% of the people here are not interested in the tech. They are looking for the mass adoption and hoping it will bring them to the moon. So they don't want to hear that Bitcoin or other crypto currencies are not ready for the masses, yet. But in my humble opinion it's the truth. There are tons of problems with these technologies (for example segwit and congestion in the networks, recent hacks of wallets and blockchains,...).

For me, it's too early to recommend investing money here if you are a non-tech or non-financial person. I would not recommend to my parents or my sister to invest their hard earned money here without my advice. It's just too dangerous. That's why I don't have a problem with all these tech jargon or acronyms here (right now).

"We want the common man to be able to trust Bitcoin and to be able to use it.  There is no hope that the common man will ever be able to understand Bitcoin well enough to understand how it works, let alone understand technical arguments associated with potential design tradeoffs.

For the past six months or more, I have recommend all of my ""common"" friends and some who were ""uncommon"" but not exceptionally curious to stay away from Bitcoin because it no longer works reliably and, more recently, was in danger of fragmenting.  Now that the community has fragmented, this recommendation is stronger.  Stay away from it and if you happen to be invested in it (not as a gambler) then don't bother using it of figuring out what coin(s) to use.

There is hope that sometime near the end of the year the situation will be stable and it may become possible to recommend users as to how to pick particular coins.  But even after things have, hopefully, settled down and we end up with one or possibly two working coins, it will still not be possible for the ""common man"" to understand Bitcoin.  But does the common man understand how computers work?  Transistors?  Electricity? Airplanes? Central banking?

One of the main problems with Bitcoin is that people perceive Bitcoin to be undervalued and that not spending any Bitcoin is the smart move. So by not spending there is little reason for merchants to accept Bitcoin as payment. If you go through the set up and become familiar with the Bitcoin process you won't see significant sales. From the perspective of the people that that have Bitcoin they don't want to be the person in the future that massively overspent for a pizza or a coffee. However if the merchants don't adopt them there is really no value in Bitcoin in the future. The current market price is total BS and could go to zero very quickly in many scenarios. I have a good plan for marketing Bitcoin and started the process but to be honest it wouldn't work because the companies involved in Bitcoin are terrible at marketing. If this trend continues then perhaps another cryptocurrency will dominate. ;6;1;False;rebildtv;dlgxkqv;Bitcoin Cash believers, can we stop taking the piss out of Corestream and focus on merchant adoption for BCC?;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6sxszs/bitcoin_cash_believers_can_we_stop_taking_the/

Yeah we need to start building again.  There has been some limited merchant adoption.  Mostly we have to wait though for the market to speak.  Fees and backlogs are going up on segwitcoin. Its only a matter of time before fees are through the roof there and everyone is pissed again like a few months ago.  That is when its Bitcoin Cash time to shine and gain the merchant adoption.  So many merchants have stopped accepting Bitcoin because of high fees, like Rakuten, and Dell and others.;19;1;False;cryptorebel;dlgdexb;Bitcoin Cash believers, can we stop taking the piss out of Corestream and focus on merchant adoption for BCC?;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6sxszs/bitcoin_cash_believers_can_we_stop_taking_the/

"1. copy/paste Bitpay

2. implement ""Bitcoin Cash"" instead of ""Segshit Settlement Coin""

3. approach all the businesses that stopped using Bitcoin/Bitcoin (before Bitpay moves their fat slow ass)

4. approach all the businesses that are STILL using BitPay/Settlement Coin, tell them of the virtues of the real bitcoin (and how its like what they really expected)

5. profit and win

It was referred to as BCC early on, however it slowly became evident that BCC was already take, and BCH became the new ticker.

"It is confusing. [The Bitcoin Cash website](https://www.bitcoincash.org/) says the recommended ticker symbol is BCC or XBC (it used to only say BCC). Problem is, BCC is the ticker symbol for something called BitConnect which has been around for a long time. Because of that another symbol had to be selected by exchanges, and anyone who didn't want to confuse it with BitConnect, so BCH was chosen. 

To make it just a little more confusing, BitConnect isn't listed on the Bittrex exchange, and they do list Bitcoin Cash as BCC there.

As to why BCC was chosen, when it was already being used, I can only conclude it was a mistake.
