"I'm not sure Net Neutrality is a libertarian value. Libertarians do generally believe in free markets, which align with the idea of limited or no government. However, being libertarian mostly has to do with empowerment of the individual, meaning the ability to freely protect one's property (eg 2nd Amendment), privacy (4th Amendment), and be free of (direct) taxes.

On the topic of Net Neutrality, however, I myself as a libertarian haven't adopted a solid position. When Ron Paul did a Reddit Ask Me Anything he took heat after espousing his position as unwavering and unapologetic for the government being *against* Net Neutrality, meaning, establishing no laws on it. As Dr. Paul put it he wanted their ""hands completely off it"". That could appear counter intuitive because libertarian principles favor and empower the little guy, but the idea behind being pro Net Neutrality is ensuring large companies can't gouge the little guy just because they own the ""pipes"" connecting them to the Internet, eg, by saying Netflix must pay a higher rate than Facebook or Google/YouTube's data, based on who they favor or profit from, or even backing their own sub-par offering at lower prices while ensuring the quality businesses carried steep pricing, which the little guy ultimately paid for.

The idea of being pro Net Neutrality is saying the Internet is a public good, and accordingly must remain free from leveraged monopoly or unfair advantage. The Internet arose from the government (public) military network, then private telecoms, such as ones connecting private homes, hooked into that; but their wiring was just typically over the ""last mile"" of data transfer, the part separating houses from more major network hubs. So one must take that into consideration when deciding whether the gov has jurisdiction on the issue. Last, there is a [Commerce Clause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerce_Clause) in the U.S. Constitution, the document libertarians champion, which would appear to have been authored specifically for jurisdiction on Net Neutrality. While the Commerce Clause has been abused many times going far beyond the letter and spirit of what was intended, it's harder to say the issue of Net Neutrality isn't precisely a textbook example of what it was attempting to address.

"Ron Paul is not arguing for it being ordinary income but rather that it should be exempt from all taxes for personal use, just like Gold is in a lot of countries that has similar taxation as the US up to a upper cap.

The reason that capital gains tax makes sense with investing in stocks/funds is that they on average over decades give positive returns. Everyone that dollar cost averages and holds into a diversified stock portfolio over decades can expect to see average long term returns as the economies and markets grow.

The same is not true for Crypto or Gold, for every person that gets a positive return there will be someone that gets the same negative return on the other side when adjusted for inflation. It is a bit worse than that for crypto since the transaction costs and fees from exchanges/conversions and the inflation of the crypto supply (Currently about 4% for Bitcoin).

This means that if there is effective taxation of peoples crypto holdings, automatic updates from places like coinbase and wallets that generate tax reports, the net income for the US government over the long term will be 0% outside of inflation since there will be a lot of tax deductions from capital losses of the less fortunate crypto buyer/sellers.

The only exception to this would be if the US citizens on average timed buying and eventually selling their Bitcoin better than the rest of the world on average, but that is unlikely.

If the goal is to get returns of the crypto wealth then put an upper limit of holdings, for example 250k before it starts to get taxed with capital gains/losses, but even then there will be an equal number of winners and losers in crypto long term.";2;2;False;YouCanWhat;e8qp7mt;Ron Paul Calls for Exempting Cryptocurrencies from Capital Gains Tax;9sls9t;https://blockmanity.com/news/ron-paul-calls-for-exempting-cryptocurrencies-from-capital-gains-tax/

It is not uncommon for countries that has capital gains tax to have exception to gold for personal investment/use.

Gold is not an company or industry that gives divided or have average growth over time, the average inflation adjusted returns on gold is just over 0% over the very long term.

People buying and selling gold funds will pay taxes, but people who collect and exchange gold coins privately will not pay any taxes as long as their holdings is under X tens of thousands of dollars.

The same is true for people who have their own crypto collections. Active traders will pay capital gains taxes just as they do on gold, but those who buy crypto for their own personal use will not.
