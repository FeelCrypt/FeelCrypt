If you believe that Bitcoin (Cash or Legacy) is centralized, please note that it is much easier to take piece of the pie from the centralized miners (just add your own hash rate), than it is for those miners to keep their supermajority (they need to add much more hash power).

The Core development team have been working on off-chain solutions to increase Bitcoin capacity rather than simply increase the blocksize.

But it backfired: Bitcoin became more popular (and valuable) than they expected, much sooner. There is a huge backlog of transactions. Since there is limited block space, people need to increase their transaction fees if they want to be included in one of the next blocks. And since all fee calculations are estimates, if the backlog is temporarily bigger and you don't realize it, even  a calculated fee may be temporarily too low and your transaction may not be verified for hours, even days....

Bitcoin Cash is a fork which, among other things, increased the block size so there is no backlog. Low fees, first confirmation in minutes: just like Bitcoin used to be.";17;3;False;dhork;dsgthcs;Legacy Bitcoin tries to buy a cup of coffee;7pf9et;https://i.redd.it/pzazijg837901.png

My main issue is just how centralized it is and the lack of nodes. There are only 1200 nodes compared to bitcoins 10,000. Of those nodes just 5 groups hold a whopping 80% of them. If any of  three (or the two largest) of these groups decided to collaborate they could bring down the whole network. Last I checked the largest 5 control 54% of bitcoin. This would require all them all on board to bring down btc. There's also a large number of small groups that control a significant amount of nodes.

But the other side of the story is that the pressure created by the unusability of BTC currently is what’s going to encourage users, devs, & exchanges to adopt off-chain scaling solutions more rapidly.

"Incorrect. It takes 15 seconds to broadcast a transaction to nodes. Miners can choose to include or not include any signed transactions they choose. 

Furthermore you can also rebroadcast another transaction with the same money and have a miner pick that one up instead. This would allow you to spend as much bch/btc as you want before the transaction is accepted into the chain, even if the miners aren't colluding with you.

Until the transaction is in the blockchain it isn't permanent (and for a truly secure transaction a few blocks into the blockchain). ";4;1;False;WHY111;dshi4c9;Legacy Bitcoin tries to buy a cup of coffee;7pf9et;https://i.redd.it/pzazijg837901.png
"That only works with Ethereum. The reason is that Ethereum transactions are from accounts to accounts, and Bitcoin/most blockchains are from transaction to transaction. This means that:

under Ethereum

* Receiving 10x 1 ETH at the same address will put 10 ETH on it
* You can then use 10 ETH in a single transaction at the same cost it would be if you moved 1 ETH.
* ie: A dust amount is made only when all funds on an account are nearly gone.

under Bitcoin

* Receiving 10x 1 BTC  at the same address will put 10 BTC (transactions) on it
* You can then use 10 BTC in a single transaction, but to do so means you need to link to all 10 previous transactions, which increases the transaction size.
* ie: every transaction can have their own dust amounts.  You do not want to mine and be paid in BTC.";14;3;False;manly_;dshgib4;Legacy Bitcoin tries to buy a cup of coffee;7pf9et;https://i.redd.it/pzazijg837901.png

If the coffee shop accepts the payment, can he then spend it even if he gets an extra transaction fee? If the next guy can't spend what he receives? The answer is quite worrisome: no. To the best of my understanding, transaction value must be much larger than the transaction fee in order to be useful.

"Transaction fees are important but they will fluctuate with the demand for every blockchain.  You should really have other considerations.

How do transaction fees match up to actual blockchain usage?  With more transactions being transmitted on the network, can any of these coins maintain their lower fees?  6 months ago Ethereum transaction fees were at $0.25.  Now that Ethereum is processing more transactions per day than any other blockchain and has reached its current network limits, it's fees are starting to spike upwards.  How long before Ethereum transactions are $10? I give it 1-2 months.  How about BCH? If it does ever reach block capacity in between hard forks how high do you think it's transaction fees will spike? Tomorrow is way more important than today because today Bitcoin Cash has serviced 40,000 transactions while, Ethereum has serviced 1.2M transactions. We need transactional networks that can process billions or trillions of transactions per day.  Which networks will succeed in making that possible cheaply?

What are the security consideration for each coin?  What is the hash collision rate for each coin's hashing algorithm?  How easy/hard is it to guess a litecoin key vs an ethereum key vs btc or bch? 

What is the hashrate being allocated to the network?  If a POW coin depends on a % of non collusive actors to mine or secure the network?  How hard is it to spin up some servers and overtake the current miners?

I'm just scratching the surface of concerns that anyone putting their money into cryptocurrencies should have.

"I do think that the btc tx fees are too high. I agree that $3 is unreasonable. It is a little bit misleading though, because the value of btc right now is so high it makes the the fees high as well. Take this exact example of my transaction but from January 2017 when the price was ~$1,000, and the transaction magically only cost me 20 cents. I actually did have a transaction from around then and the tx fee was 0.00035, that's like 25 cents in january 2017 . And that transaction took...about 12 minutes. Is that a problematic tx fee or wait time? I'm not sure, I think that's probably pretty fair. If we want to use your example of the family savings of $1500, it takes ~7500 transactions to wipe them out. I think they'll be ok. 

That's the main reason I prefer to make the discussion of tx fees in the relative coin instead of converting to fiat. The *only* reason anything is 'broken' at this point is because btc exploded 15x in a 12mo period, and the tx fees haven't found a way to reduce themselves by a factor of 15 or scale with the valuation swings. If it's creating this big of problems at $15k, how on earth will it be sustainable if btc really moons and it hits something insane like 100k? That's very worrying to me looking long term, and will for sure break the coin if it's not fixed.

What I don't like is how almost every thread now in this subreddit is people making up moronic things about btc and then just chanting about bch.

"There were soft limits miners used for many years until we hit the hard 1Mb limit.  [Here is an article](https://medium.com/@peter_r/on-the-emerging-consensus-regarding-bitcoins-block-size-limit-insights-from-my-visit-with-2348878a16d8) that was published by Peter Rizun, of BU, regarding fully configurable block sizes.  The included graph shows where the soft limits were being hit before miners would increase the limit.

Basically, the miners don't want to create blocks that other miners won't accept and validate.  They are conservative with the scaling.

Bitcoin Cash has the 8Mb limit and we're moving the hard limit to 32Mb in the hardfork scheduled for May 15.  There is much discussion on if a hard limit is even necessary at all.

"> even ISP bandwidth in rural areas couldn’t sustain that. 

Today's couldn't, but why do we need people in rural areas across the world running full nodes in the first place? This is what Bitcoin's creator said about network configuration:

> Long before the network gets anywhere near as large as that, it would be safe for users to use Simplified Payment Verification (section 8) to check for double spending, which only requires having the chain of block headers, or about 12KB per day. Only people trying to create new coins would need to run network nodes. At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to specialists with server farms of specialized hardware. A server farm would
only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with that one node. -- **Satoshi Nakamoto**

EDIT: Also from the same email:

> **The bandwidth might not be as prohibitive as you think.** A typical transaction would be about 400 bytes (ECC is nicely compact). Each transaction has to be broadcast twice, so lets say 1KB per transaction. Visa processed 37 billion transactions in FY2008, or an average of 100 million transactions per day. That many transactions would take 100GB of bandwidth, or the size of 12 DVD or
2 HD quality movies, or about $18 worth of bandwidth at current prices. **If the network were to get that big, it would take several years, and by then, sending 2 HD movies over the Internet would probably not seem like a big deal.**";5;1;False;anthson;dshgldt;Legacy Bitcoin tries to buy a cup of coffee;7pf9et;https://i.redd.it/pzazijg837901.png

"**Infinite monkey theorem**

The infinite monkey theorem states that a monkey hitting keys at random on a typewriter keyboard for an infinite amount of time will almost surely type a given text, such as the complete works of William Shakespeare. In fact the monkey would almost surely type every possible finite text an infinite number of times. However, the probability that monkeys filling the observable universe would type a complete work such as Shakespeare's Hamlet is so tiny that the chance of it occurring during a period of time hundreds of thousands of orders of magnitude longer than the age of the universe is extremely low (but technically not zero).

In this context, ""almost surely"" is a mathematical term with a precise meaning, and the ""monkey"" is not an actual monkey, but a metaphor for an abstract device that produces an endless random sequence of letters and symbols.

Let's face it. In this market we vote with our speculation. And our speculation is what drives this market, since blockchain is all about putting the power back in the hands of the people.

The truth is that most XRP owners are long Bitcoin as well.  Let’s be realistic here.  Most of us judge the success of certain crypto coins by how valuable it is based on USD, KRW, YEN, or other monetary values.  In fact, most of us get excited when the value of Bitcoin in USD terms goes up and the shout of “to the moon” is heard.  So, when the most of the members shout “To the moon” or other memes, you need to realize that you are basing the success of Bitcoin or XRP to USD terms.  USD, by the way, is printed and issued by the Federal Reserve, which is anything but federal, but that topic is another issue.   So, rather than talking about some crypto coin science project of attempting to build a wonderful world where Bitcoin replaces the entire banking system, the reality is we like Bitcoin because it brings us a lot of USD into our pockets.  So, rather than being obtuse and point fingers to certain coins for being “centralized” or less centralized, how about we become honest with ourselves and think about how we can make money through speculating on Bitcoin and other crypto currencies.  Also, if you think those vendors currently accepting Bitcoin are doing it to replace our banking system, my friend, you are beyond delusional.  ;2;0;False;Ny4nae;dsgthwg;Okay, this Ripple shit is ridiculous.

"> So what do you disagree with? The first (8MB is insufficient for mass adoption) or the latter (we cannot keep increasing block size)?

Neither actually; what I disagree with are your premises. Allow me to explain:

> In order to allow 7 billion people (world's population) to make 2 transactions a day, you would need 24GB Blocks. This assumes 250 bytes/tx.

Here, you're making three fatal assumptions:

*  The first one is that bitcoin will ever become a single global payment network seeking to replace all currencies and forms of money transfer. This **may** come to pass, but from a realistic PoV it's highly, highly unlikely. I could go into the reasons for why if you desire, but I hope this notion is pretty self-explanatory.

* The second assumption is that, even if we were to assume that 1) will come true (and again, it's huge-honking *if*), that it will happen within the next 20 years, a time when technology (processing speed, network storage, and bandwidth) could be somewhat cautiously be argued to not necessarily being able to handle 24GB blocks. Bitcoin has grown inmensely in the last 9 years, but even if we assumed a continued exponential adoption rate (something that hasn't held true in the last couple of years); bitcoin would still fall waaaaaaaaay short from getting to the point of ""global financial network substituting every currency"". But 20 years down the road? All bets are fucking off. even 15 years ago nobody could foresee there being cheap, commonly avaiblable gigabit FTTH, and that's exactly the kind of connection I'm writing to you from. Moore's Law might not be an actual ""law"", but it sure as hell has been exceeded in all 3 commonly argued ""blottlenecks"" for bitcoin.

* The third fatal assumption is that, even if 1) and 2) were true (should we attempt to calculate the odds of this happening?) the bitcoin protocol will remain unchanged, and the same bottlenecks we're seeing today will remain so 20 years from now (or whenever assumption 1) is supposed to be achieved). This is also quite absurd, even in the stagnated ""immutable protocol"" legacy bitcoin, as I'm sure you're aware. 

> but that's generally acknowledged to create centralisation in nodes and mining.

This is something else that you're taking for granted, and it also includes the assumption that an ""uncensorable"" network topology must include some significant percentage of bitcoin users as ""full (non-mining) nodes"". This latter assumption is a huge one, and I haven't seen evidence to support it. I know you said you don't like Arguments From Satoshi (authority), but given that he designed the network layout, the very layout we're still using today, I hope you can forgive if I mention that the ""invention"" of ""full (non mining) nodes"" isn't something Satoshi designed. SPV wallets don't truly represent an adversarial increase in risk as compared to ""full (non-mining) nodes"", and a topology of miners (full nodes) - SPV nodes is exactly how the network was designed to run. The first assumption, that that ""it's generally acknowledged that increasing the blocksize increases centralisation"" isn't exactly untrue, but what little evidence we have doesn't really support that notion that it happens in any significant manner at blocksizes below several hundreds of MB, with today's hardware and protocol. But hey, I'm nothing if not open minded, so I'll gladly review evidence if you want to present it to me.

As a more general design philosophy for bitcoin, the real discrepancy between BTC and BCH is this notion of ""finding a natural technological limit for scalability when and **if** it is ever reached"", vs ""let's keep the limit artificially restricted to absurdly-low levels at the expense of literally everything else, and creating post-hoc rationalisations for it that might even be innerly-inconsistent""; and the latter is just a philosophy I can simply never get behind, precisely when we're talking about trying to create a universally accesible, censorship-resistant, peer-to-´peer electronic cash payment network. I just can't. I no longer complain about the BTC Core Devs seeking to do things in such a way because we finally have our fork where we can see our vision realised; so in general terms, and while I might enjoy debating the absurdity of the small-blocker mindset, I just couldn't care less what BTC does anymore. 

But I do think it's important to point out that the small-blocker argument (and to a T what you've laid out in this comment), can be boiled down to a slippery-slope fallacy. 

I do think we may eventually find a natural technological limit to Bitcoin scalability; but given that I don't know where its natural adoption curve will end up, or what market niche it'll end up occupying (I hope right now you agree that both BTC and BCH's value consist of > 99.99999% speculation), I'm not at all of the opinion that we should be artificially cornered into this or that, especially if it means restricting its natural adoption when we're orders of magnitude from reaching even **today's** natural technological scalability limits.";2;1;False;redlightsaber;dsh2pdp;"Blockexplorer.com going to call bch ""bitcoin"" while technologically obsolete btc will be called ""bitcoin legacy""";7pbiga;http://bitcoincash.blockexplorer.com/

"And I do not think you understand how cryptocurrency as a technology and ethos works, or what I'm trying to say.

I also don't think you understand how early adoption works, or how the long tail works, or what I'm trying to tell you and warn you about that a lot of mass of early adopters and, y'know, the people who were into it way before you were have long since cashed out and left BTC and won't touch it with a 50 foot pole.

We're all sitting over here watching it and waiting for the inevitable bottom to fall out, for Tether to collapse and for the bottom to fall out of the rest of the market.

Which means you don't actually know how the market works, either, even though you think you do - when you're really just tunnel-vision focused on speculative and/or increasing value.

That's a fine mindset for a trader, but you might as well be trading soybean futures or silver. That has nothing to do with cryptocurrency as an evolving technology, who is using it and where that value is coming from.

Cash market valuation is only one metric of value. And the trading/spec market is not actually the primary function of any of these cryptocurrencies. People have just turned it into that, and they might as well be trading tulip bulbs if they're not deploying or using the technology in the real world.

Seriously, some folks might as well be trading memes.

And some people care a lot more about actually being able to use a given blockchain or network than they are about what the arbitrary price of the coin in a given fiat if they're using that particular chain as a secure transmission conduit.

Yes, that might sound crazy to you but some people aren't actually interested in cryptocurrencies because they want to get rich, speculate or even hodl. That simplified hodl mentality is for scared, gullible sheep.

Simply ""hodling"" in the cult like way /r/bitcoin has promoted is what people tell you when the want to make money off of your gullibility. This has never not been true in trading, be it forex, commodities or listed blue chip stocks.

Because what some of us really care about is moving some value through the network in exchange for something else. If it's fiat going in and fiat going out at either end as fast as possible, they don't care what the value of the coin itself is.

They just care that the network is secure, fast and a low fee and that what goes in one end comes out the other side in some usable form.

Or that they're able to quickly and securely buy, say, a cup of fucking coffee.

If you think cash market value is the only real measurement or metric of a coin, you really don't understand cryptocurrency or blockchains at all.

This is a very, very simplistic and limited view to hold. It's emotional tunnel vision.

Sources: Involved in and interested in cryptocurrencies since 2009. Interested in cryptography since the early 90s.

I used to play with scripted forex and commodities back in the mid 90s when stale 15 minute old market data could still cost you a few grand USD a month, plus satellite data terminal leasing fees.

The hype around bitcoin and crypto isn't new to me.

So, maybe put aside what you think you know and think about the fact I'm trying to offer you a warning and tell you something:

BTC is in a bubble. BTC is vulnerable to Tether pegging. Most coins are overinflated in value due to hype and fresh blood, but BTC is especially hyped. Right now, most of the major coins follow BTCs USD value lead.

None of this is an indication of a healthy, functional, liquid or diversified market. The market is very, very brittle right now.

And you're and everyone else is a goddamn fool if you don't think that those chickens aren't coming home to roost for BTC and the fools trying to prop it up.

That's exactly the point, you claim one can somehow ""change the consensus rules with a fork"". Such a thing was never part of the definition, this ten year old whitepaper you're so eager to quote.

However, what actually *is* in the whitepaper is the ""most work defines the valid chain"" rule, which bcash completely does away with, since obviously there exists a valid chain, that has much more accumulated difficulty than bcash has.

So obviously your ""we respect the original vision"" thing only applies when it's convenient for you, pretty selective reading you have here.

While I do disagree with you taking issue with the 7 billion figure (it's illustrative that eventually a large block size is required if all transactions are on change - feel free to take a fraction of it) and the rate of adoption  (I don't think mass adoption will take 20 years) you clearly have a researched and considered view.

I'm not against increasing blocks but I do envisage a secure, global, low fee and fast currency with mass adoption. Call me naive but Bitcoin with Lightning is better suited to this than Bitcoin Cash (without segwit).

"> +1 for a very thorough response.

Well, I bothered with it only because you seemed to make at the very least honest points. I'm always up for a give-and-take.  

> Call me naive but Bitcoin with Lightning is better suited to this 

I don't think you're naive; from an obssesive comp-sci's PoV, having to secure and store every single person's transactions in your personal computer seems incredibly wasteful, and I can absolutely see that. But that's the actual desgin of bitcoin, and indeed its earth-shattering innovation. It's the unavoidable solution to the Bizantine General Problem, and something that, I'm sorry, the Lightning Network doesn't provide. Something else the LN doesn't provide: a truly decentralised (which translated to **real** censorship resistance) routing algorithm, which would be the way to achieve the segregated network topology that the original LN protocol promised it would be allowed to do. If you don't know what I'm alluding to, please ask me for more information; I tend to assume well-spoken and calm people are super-well informed about all the intricacies of the different proposals, but unfortunately if /r/bitcoin is your main source of information, you won't find information on those kinds of limitations and underdeliverance of promises that has become the LN.

Plus, don't get me wrong; I'm not **against** L2 solutions such as the LN. The LN provides a very interesting scalability option that's bound to find a certain market usage **on its own merits**: for instance, true microtransactions (and the kinds of yet-nonexistent markets that they could enable) would be the ideal usecase for the LN. But I think ""LN maximalists"" fail to understand a couple of very important points:

* As I said **it is not truly censorship resistant**. Decentralisation is not a binary value, and the LN is no doubt a more decentralised option than, say, a tipping service (such as the one that's very popular for BCH); but it is not truly, completely, permissionless and decentralised, which means it should *never* be lauded as a main-chain alternative to trnsacting in bitcoin. 

* The LN is a clunky protocol that, depite vast improvements in UI from wallets, will forever be bound to its inherent UX limitations: mainly, being ""a separate"" way to transact from ""real"" bitcoin, the fact that you have to ""lock in"" funds, etc...

* On a philosophical level (and also a practical one, but this offends me less), **artificially restricting on-chain transactions to force users onto the LN, is wrong**, misguided, and ultimately, probably also infeasible (in the sense that this ""forced fee market"" is irreducibly unstable, and cannot allow ever for predictable fees, etc, that would offer on-ramps towards LN usage, even if we chose to ignore the previous 2 points.

The only aspect about which I think you could be considered naive, is in ignoring the network effect of the infrastructure already built around bitcoin; and furthermore how businesses left and right are adopting BCH precisely because of this network effect, and how not-a-hassle-at-all it is. This will not hold true for the LN (and it's not holding true for SegWit, even, which require far fewer adaptations).

> than Bitcoin Cash (without segwit).

The funniest part of it all, and something large portions of the community have been **lied to about**, is this notion that LN can't happen without SegWit. Go ahead, ask /u/nullc about it (he never dares to respond to me as of late, and I don't think he can claim I troll or otherwise harass him); a few months ago, when SegWit didn't seem like it was going to be activated (fun fact; it was only activated due to the NY agreement which the Core devs then built a huge massive campaign against fulfilling the second tenet of it) he cheerfully went around reminding everyone that SegWit isn't really necessary for the LN; it merely makes its implementation easier. And it's true. But more than that, what makes the LN implementation easier isn't some magical property of SegWit, it's merely a fix to transaction malleability, which is something the BCH teams are studying of introducing to the protocol in a future upgrade (just not for its own sake). 

> Ultimately the future will prove who is right or wrong.

The thing about ""the future"" as an indication of anything, is that we will never get there, and it will forever remain nebulous. Things are happening as we speak: Bitcoin's Market Dominance is at an All Time Low (and falling), and BCH is quickly gaining ground. Do you not believe trends are already visible?

"How about Bitcoin heads and Bitcoin tails? Because a fork does not create a dominant and subordinate chain, a fork is specific. Bch forked to accept 8mb blocks, BTC forked to implement.ent segregated witness allowing ""replace by fee"" tramsactions and ""anyone can spend"" coins by breaking the chain of signatures. These are both attempts to address scailing. Segwit enables sidechains like the lightning network and intends to pay for the sidechains with mining fees. Bitcoin cash seeks to meet the growing  demand for transactions by increasing the main chain capacity 8x making fees 8x lower, neither of these are the legacy Bitcoin with 1mb blocks and no Segwit. The Bitcoin core fork required wallet providers to make changes and required miners to make changes as well. The exosystem trusted core and ended up pointing their users at the highest fees ever paid in the history of Bitcoin with the total fees in some blocks nearly reaching the block reward itself. Bitcoin Segwit failed and should refactor itself back into bch and redouble everyone's holding on each chain, arriving at a block chain that is Segwit backwards compatible but not forward compatible. The problem is core won't even consider the possibility because they have been bought by blockstream, which has shareholders and profit motives like all Delaware corporations do.

"> In August 2017, Bitcoin forked into two variants. These have taken radically different paths.

> Looking at the situation one quarter later, it is clear to us that the Blockstream fork of bitcoin diverges so radically from the ideas presented in the Bitcoin white paper, that it is an evolutionary dead end. While it may still have high trading value, as a mere collectible of curiosity, the Blockstream fork of bitcoin is not part of building any future financial infrastructure, which is what Block Explorer is about.
A currency of the future has subcent optional usage fees and instant transactions. The Blockstream fork of Bitcoin (""Bitcoin Legacy"") is at $20 usage fees and rising, with no end in sight, and can take days to confirm, despite unfulfilled promises to the contrary on both points when Segwit activated in what can only be described as a community fistfight. We are therefore making the decision to consider the Blockstream fork deprecated, and support it as legacy technology only.

> Rather, we have made the decision to support the only bitcoin fork with a postive utility momentum, which is Bitcoin Cash. We took an early decision to deploy a Bitcoin Cash block explorer and will continue to roll out related services. We are also deploying tools for other cryptocurrencies we find on a positive momentum path, such as ZCash, which have increased privacy value.
We will not add future support for the Blockstream fork of bitcoin (""Bitcoin Legacy""), and will be deprecating it entirely at some future point in time to be determined. Developments have revealed it to be a dead end. At such a time, we will refer to Bitcoin Cash as Bitcoin only, but will make some effort to not break API calls by changing URLs of legacy automated systems.

"Since we're being ""technical"", the whitepaper only refers to the longest *chain* when determining which chain is valid. The bitcoin cash chain is longer.

But if we're looking for serious discussion, and not just 'tit-for-tat' shenanigans...

The intent of the whitepaper is to talk about the longest proof of work from the point of view of a person looking to validate that proof of work. In order to validate a chain, you need to set out some rules as to what is valid and what is invalid. Since the whitepaper *is* clear about how a transaction is authenticated (the signature is in the transaction), it would follow that anyone validating bitcoin (as per the whitepaper) would find that blocks that have segwit transactions are invalid, and therefore the proof of work is actually proof of invalid work. This would mean what is currently known as the Bitcoin Cash blockchain is also the longest valid accumulated work (again, if you're validating against the bitcoin whitepaper).";45;4;False;madmockers;dsglk1c;"Blockexplorer.com going to call bch ""bitcoin"" while technologically obsolete btc will be called ""bitcoin legacy""";7pbiga;http://bitcoincash.blockexplorer.com/

I do however disagree with you that people have to stop looking at the white paper. It is what everyone that matters agrees is the basic rulebook for bitcoin. No one has to follow the rules laid out by Satoshi. But to maintain bitcoin I think it is imperative to change as few of the main tenants as possible. Otherwise why not increase the blocks to 21 billion? Then everyone entering the market now would have a chance to buy full BTC and not a fraction? Why not change to a proof of stake algorithm? Why not do any variety of major changes?  Everyone is welcome to take the bitcoin source and make a new coin with those changes (and many have). But they are not bitcoin and do not share the same chain. The version of bitcoin we will have in 50 years  will probably look very different than today's but we should not throw away the white paper and all the great ideas it contains without some very deep thought.

"True but it's politics and semantics (language is powerful). However even when Bitcoin Cash has majority hashrate I don't want to go back to the Bitcoin name. Why? Because we as a community get to decide if we want to change the name of something that is FOSS. Bitcoin is suppose to be like Cash. That is why the Bitcoin and Cash are now married (let's put a ring on it)  and I don't ever want to see a divorce. Bitcoin Cash is now a name that is becoming known all over the internet because it's so fricking awesome. It's just like Bitcoin in 2011 but with a bigger group of people that have heard about it. At least this is one of the few good things about the market price of all crypto being so high (won't last forever, half of my friends are going to hate the other half). People now listen when I talk about Bitcoin but most people have now idea that Bitcoin is Cash. They just think they are buying stock. If only they knew ... so I make my content and share it here and on yours.org and then I go: Hey somebody send me money over the internet with a 0.6 cent fee and it took 30 seconds before I saw it on my computer screen.  This is the power of participating and then telling people about how awesome participating it. 

So let's stay with the Bitcoin Cash name. Core will become obsolete anyways so we should not worry about them anymore. They are done, you can see they are loosing grip and power. Now if only Reddit would step in and ban all the /r/bitcoin moderators .... and give /r/bitcoin back to the community. But it does not matter to much. /r/btc is growing fast and it's filling up with the right kind of people.

"This video proposes no solution at all.

All it says is ""we don't think mental illness has any scientific basis, nor do we agree any mental illnesses are real""... it also says ""there is no such thing as schizophrenia, they probably just have brain damage"".

So what solution do they propose? When some extreme schizophrenics are physically harming themselves or their young siblings, and some 'big pharma scam' medication is helping at least calm them down, what alternative is proposed? Literally nothing is proposed in this video.

I agree that whatever 'mental illness' is, is certainly in its infancy compared to physical illnesses - this is quite obvious. And I also agree that some medicines are completely unnecessary and being pushed for no other reason than profit-taking.

That's because there is massive profit incentive to keep them illegal and massive industries that have formed around the pretense of them being illegal. For instance, the DEA, a massive bureaucratic institution has to continue to legitimize its own existence, other police bodies make loads of money off of arrests and seizure of property in drug arrests, pharmaceutical companies have competing products for the aforementioned use case, private prisons have to continue to drive profit for their investors which means full cells, the vendors that deal in this economy need bigger contracts think food, bedding, clothing, etc. This is one of the examples of where the US brand of capitalism creates perverse incentive, similar to healthcare. In general, I think I can say the societal goal of a prison system would be generally speaking public safety and hopefully most would say rehabilitation is a main goal. The goal of a private prison is to make profit, which can be done by imprisoning more nonviolent citizens with inane drug laws, lobbying for harsher penalties, etc. Basically things that run counter to the societal goal.  ;23;1;False;KingLeo23;dshcc9o;Let's make MDMA a legal medicine for PTSD.

"I feel you, but we need to be careful. FDA procedures for approving a drug, unlike most bureaucratic procedures, are heavily scientifically based, and properly conducted clinical trials are essential to ascertain the effectiveness and safety of a treatment.

Drugs are easily prone to become popular faith targets, where people will blindly believe they are getting any benefit, while getting none (or getting worse). In Brazil, people would stop cancer treatment, and instead take a drug developed by a rogue chemistry university lab that distributed it for free (the substance is called phosphorylethanolamine).

The situation remained lawless for years, until brought to public attention in mass media, which prompted the university to prohibit the lab from producing and distributing the drug. Then followed a public outcry in favor of the allegedly cure of cancer, and the university was forced to continue the production of the drug by legal injuctions broght by users and even a federal law was enacted allowing the exceptional use of the substance for cancer treatment. That law, for obvious reasons, was extremely ill received by the scientific community which had the supreme court to deem it unconstitutional.

In between the political chaos, proper clinical trials were started, which failed to show any effectiveness of the drug for cancer treatment. The initial (bad) results had the inclusion of new patients suspended in the clinical trials, for ethical reasons (treating cancer patients with sugar pills poses indeed ethical concerns). Study is still ongoing for original patients that haven't died, but all indication shows it will never develop into a useful treatment.";2;1;False;lcvella;dshfk21;Let's make MDMA a legal medicine for PTSD.

"That this subreddit is talking about MDMA is amazing.

I am extremly involved with pharmacology and have been following it for a long time as well have written a few nice theories available [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/7ix66i/phenibut_significantly_increases_bdnf_and_vegf_in/dr2a46d/).

I am thankful that maps exists and it is highly likely that MDMA will become a legitimate medicine around 2020.

Some other extremly promising medicines are ketamine for depression (extremly effective), psilocybin mushrooms or Lysergic Acid Diethylamine (LSD) for depression/anxiety/ptsd, and Iboga for opioid addiction (something I have personally struggled with).

Also, not on maps but from me personally.  Kratom has saved my life from opioid addiction.  It also can treat depression / anxiety / pain problems / ADHD / Drinking or Addiction Problems and on top of that, has some health benefits.  Visit /r/Kratom if you want to learn more about it.

"Well, as others have said, we created r/btc as refugees expelled from r/bitcoin, and this became the home for those wanting on-chain scaling.  As a result, Bitcoin Cash is our coin of choice.

As soon as Bitcoin Cash forked, someone squatted on r/bch, so that wasn't an option.  There is r/bitcoincash, which is also focused on Bitcoin Cash.  For many of us, r/btc has been our home for many years.

The naming and confusion stuff is marketing, and we need to get better at that.  This will happen over time.  I agree that there is a large 'Bitcoin Cash *is* Bitcoin' camp, and while I understand the sentiment, it is not helping matters.

"r/btc was actually created in 2015 in answer to the r/bitcoin mods being corrupt and has been the forum for the rebels and people in the know for years. I've been a rebel since before r/btc and have been here from the very beginning btw. I rage quit at one point and deleted my account, /u/PsyRev, you can find me in reddit archives arguing with the mods on r/bitcoin back in 2014. This goes way back, the takeover began late 2013 with developers who didn't follow the narrative silently getting phased out of the bitcoin core development team.

As for key people. It's really overstated what it's like from our side, guessing you've been hearing we all follow Roger Ver like a cult or something. We don't. Roger is just a regular guy here who's been a known name for his early adoption endevours, and he's promoting bitcoin cash as I would in his shoes. The only reason it appears this is being 'played' by key people is because fake accounts over at r/bitcoin are making fake discussions slandering Roger and trying to make it seem like he's somehow tied to bitcoin cash more than just being one of the most known of people promoting it.

"> The developers of BTC appear to be tainted in some way - there is no competent project team that would ever let the current situation linger as it has with Bitcoin's high fees and slow transfer times. It's extremely suspicious and it appears they are either trying to kill off Bitcoin or ransack users with fees well after the LN network horse comes riding in.

Well the thing is, they actually did do something about it. With segwit, btc has double the capacity, just sitting there, mostly unused by the main transaction producers.

So right now, the btc chain is like a 2 lane road, and Coinbase parked their truck in one of the lanes. So what's the solution? Do you create a new lane? Or do you ask Coinbase to stop being an dick and move their truck? If you do end up creating a new lane, why would Coinbase move their parked truck? What stops them from blocking the new lane with another truck?

That's pretty much what's going on, except it's not just Coinbase. A bunch of other big companies, like blockchain.info, are doing this type of stuff too. And there's no real technical reason for this, it seems to be political mostly. Migrating to segwit is pretty easy tbh. I mean a lot of wallets enabled segwit addresses immediately after it got activated.

I feel like there are some people with really shady motives getting rich off normal people. And to me, it really doesn't seem to the devs. Most of them seem to be legit old school free software and GNU/linux hackers. Do you really think they are that shady compared to other people?

"> You forget that the system is easy to corrupt and ends up like the banking system it is trying to replace.

Completely disagree. It's not easy to corrupt. The system is designed to be fueled by greed. The greed of a miner to maximize his profits. This is a very reliable mechanism. To bribe it you'd have to bribe a huge industry of hard to locate individuals who already earn more than enough money by just being honest participants.

"Two differently traded coins, BTC (Bitcoin) and BCH/BCC (Bitcoin Cash).  The two communities are entirely fractured and there is no hope of reconciliation.  The spirit of what brought Bitcoin alive is completely dead.  

The developers of BTC appear to be tainted in some way - there is no competent project team that would ever let the current situation linger as it has with Bitcoin's high fees and slow transfer times.  It's extremely suspicious and it appears they are either trying to kill off Bitcoin or ransack users with fees well after the LN network horse comes riding in. 

Bitcoin Cash is unfortunately a risky alternative since it is linked to major holders such as Roger Ver who would have no problem dumping his major holding on your head when you decide to buy-in (it's not illegal, after all).  If there is a development roadmap, they don't talk about it too much and instead post pictures like OP's (as amusing as it is) while lamenting the memes on r/Bitcoin. 

Anyway, you get the idea.  If you want the baggage, get into Bitcoin (and variants).  If you're here for a stable store of value or to invest in technology, then there's already viable, secure, cheap replacements in production with proven project teams (not just tech-heads, either). 

P.S. Note the censorship r/btc style. I might not get banned here but there's no love for people who don't tow the BCH line.

Totally and utterly false.  I have seen exact comments of zero concern result in people’s banning.  Many times.  

I was banned for saying that Bitcoin is supposed to be peer to peer cash akin to handing someone a dollar. Instant and “free” with no third party.  

I’ve been in this scene since Bitcoin was $59 and have poured the last 7 years of my life into promoting it.   The moderators all know who I am and I have corresponded with them and Greg Maxwell (shoot - and everyone else you’ve heard of) for years.  

I am banned and never allowed back for saying the above.  

The abuse of power is so egregious at this point that conspiracy theories seem to be the  only rational explanation.  I try not to go there, but I cannot explain it otherwise. ";3;0;False;BitttBurger;dsgtgoq;Meanwhile on /r/bitcoin;7pbz0m;https://i.imgur.com/bNWtaC3.jpg
"i'll be as objective as possible(most of the replies here have been very biased)

/r/bitcoin became very censored and controlled by some mods, so they made /r/btc to escape that. then we had a fork of bitcoin in august 2017 which split it into Bitcoin(BTC) and BitcoinCash(BCH), ones uses offchain transactions as a temporary solution and the other increased the blocksize (BTC has a blocksize of 1mb). BTC dev team think increasing blocksize too much and too fast is a bad idea, and the BCH dev teams think it's fine and doesn't compromise decentralization. BCH has/is being heavily advertised by Roger Ver (mod in this sub) in order to gain control and ""take over"" the name Bitcoin - it's common for /r/bitcoin to use ""Bcash"" and /r/btc to use BitcoinLegacy or names such as cripplecoin/segshit etc.this sub has become home to BCH and if your view differs from liking BCH you will downvoted and called a troll, while at /r/bitcoin you will most likely have your post removed and and possibly banned (i will note, i am frequent in both subs and have yet to be banned from there myself)

First off, he's talked about it on CNBC and he's added the section on bitcoin.com about BCH. Heavy advertising? As for the name.. The objective truth there is that the name is for whatever people consider bitcoin. I definitely consider bitcoin cash the true bitcoin, so to me it's 'bitcoin'. If you want to be objective when talking about the name you have to mention that they're both bitcoin and one may be insignificant in the future.

"No, it was not political at all. And simply posting the definition of political doesn't help your argument either.

 Miners are motivated by one thing: profit. 

They want bigger blocks so they can squeeze more transactions into a block and collect more fees. Plus, bigger blocks = more transactions = higher price for a Bitcoin. 

And since miners usually own lots of BTC, increasing price of a coin increases their net worth. So add that to the increase in fee revenue, and you've got adequate motivation to increase the block size for sure. 

And as the keepers of the blockchain, the people who have invested the most into it's security, they're more than qualified to make that decision. 

The people being ""political"" honestly are the small blockers, who have **not** invested into the security of the chain.

>How B2X be a takeover if it only took Core a few line code change to stay in the game?

Less risky than changing the economic properties of Bitcoin? Less risky than making merchants quit accepting Bitcoin transactions? Less risky than causing a fork of the main chain into BCH? The current set of Core developers unfortunately ignore any non-engineering risks. The developers that spoke to these risks were booted from the project or quit out of frustration - Gavin, Mike Hearn, Jeff Garzik, and I'm sure many lesser known devs. Good luck to such a cryptocoin project.

> items on the hard fork wish list

I think the odds of there being a hard fork of BTC that does not cause a chain split to be very low at this point. There will be a group of people that will try to keep the original chain alive either because they honestly believe ""Bitcoin should never hard fork"" or just to weaken BTC and strengthen a different coin (specifically BCH, but probably also Monero and others). If the Core dev team wanted a future hardfork to possibly make changes other than a blocksize increase, i think they have ruined the chance for that to not cause a chain split. The new hard-forked Core coin would most likely have to give up the ""BTC"" and ""Bitcoin"" monikers. Because of this, I don't think we'll ever see BTC attempt a hard fork. The Core devs kinda messed up if they really did want a future hard fork - a simple 2MB blocksize increase could have been so easy! :)";1;1;False;themgp;dsgcvq7;"Please stop saying ""Increase the block size""";7p7sxc;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7p7sxc/please_stop_saying_increase_the_block_size/

It is true that it is a very complex decision.  Ultimately there can be only one coin with the most hashrate, only one coin with the biggest blocks, and one coin with the smallest blocks.  By definition, no coin can be the best at everything.

There is no value in personalized coins each mined individually with the parameters we choose, but not accepted by anyone else.  Unfortunately this means none of us is going to get the perfect coin.  Only a handful of truly viable coins will emerge and you gotta go with the one you want.

You think I'm telling people what to do.  You could say that.  You could also say the same thing about a person who sees a friend hitting himself in the face with a hammer who says, ""hey, stop hitting yourself in the face with a hammer!""

"Exactly. Anyone who thinks LN ""solves"" scaling is crazy. First and foremost, you have to do two transactions on chain to process through a payment channel. At current blocksize, that means you can only process two or three payment channels a second, or ~100 million a year. That may sound like a lot, but at that pace the only way to give every human a payment channel would be to make one at birth and wait for everyone who doesn't have one to die (as it'd take about 75 years to process the 7.5 billion you need). Realistically, you'll need several channels per person, and you'll want to be able to process at least a billion people's worth of payment channels a year.

Long run, the blocksize will have to increase. Maybe we'll start quadrupling it every four years starting in 2024, ending in 2040 with 256MB blocks and the ability to process around a thousand payment channels a second.";2;0;False;nanite1018;dsfzdj7;"Please stop saying ""Increase the block size""";7p7sxc;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7p7sxc/please_stop_saying_increase_the_block_size/

In fact, LN works better with bigger blocks, cheaper to open and close channels, you just aren't REQUIRED to do it, like with Core's implementation.  If it saves blockspace, great, but it doesn't need to be prioritized over simple on-chain TX.;2;0;False;grateful_dad819;dsg8vop;"Please stop saying ""Increase the block size""";7p7sxc;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7p7sxc/please_stop_saying_increase_the_block_size/

">the same trick can't be applied to break any protocol rule, though,

Yes you can, as long as the old node can’t see the new data you can relax any rules.

Even supply.


>you can't relax the rules without a hard fork, 

Again segwit did.

>you can only work around them if it's technically possible, as in the case w/ SW because it was possible to work around.  not all rules are the same.

It is possible to go work around the 21 millions limit too.

Hide the new supply to old nodes and enforce a soft fork that allow only transactions going to that new data structure.

To old it would appear that onlt transactions going to burn adress get validated.

That new data space can have any consensus rules.. even infinite supply.

Old node would see nothing.

>Just like Bitcoin Cash's propaganda of being the original Bitcoin even though it's not followed by any node that followed BTC before August 1st and it has a minority hashrate and smaller price (which means smaller demand since the supply is very similar).

BCH is a fork to recover Bitcoin original characteristics. 

It is BTC that changes.

"**Insider trading**

Insider trading is the trading of a public company's stock or other securities (such as bonds or stock options) by individuals with access to nonpublic information about the company. In various countries, some kinds of trading based on insider information is illegal. This is because it is seen as unfair to other investors who do not have access to the information, as the investor with insider information could potentially make larger profits than a typical investor could make.

The authors of one study claim that illegal insider trading raises the cost of capital for securities issuers, thus decreasing overall economic growth.

"> The fact that Satoshi Nakamoto has some view of what Bitcoin is and is not

Satoshi invented the original Bitcoin, which no longer exists.  He open sourced his code, and now many projects implement the Bitcoin idea and protocol as described in the white paper.  Some of them incorporate the name Bitcoin, some do not.

> He wrote the white paper. BTC is not what is described as Bitcoin. BCH is.

That is factually incorrect.

> straw man argument

That is not correct either.  You explicitly said that you found it acceptable to cause inconvenience and hassle to new users for the sake of the name.  Pointing out that you said that and then explaining why that's a bad thing is not remotely a straw man argument.

> Straight blockstream propaganda. Blockstream/core tell us that if you raise the block size today, Bitcoin is somehow doomed tomorrow because it can't compete on Visa level transactions today.

The white paper does not mention a block size.  That is a fact.  If you're going to use the white paper to defend your idea of what Bitcoin is, then I'm perfectly free to use it to counter your claims.

Just because something doesn't align with your views does not make it propaganda.  I never said that I agreed with keeping the blocksize small.  All I claimed is that a larger blocksize is not de facto ""more Bitcoin"" than a smaller block size.

> [Lots of Satoshi quotes about bandwidth and nodes]

There's a few points to bring up.  The first and most obvious one is that Satoshi's speculations about the future aren't technical specs and weren't implemented.  The white paper and the source code provide the defition of Bitcoin, and not even Satoshi himself gets to redefine what Bitcoin is.  If Satoshi came out of hiding tomorrow and said Bitcoin  should be more centralized and like Paypal and there should only be 2 nodes, run by governments, guess what... nobody would do that or call his vision Bitcoin.  Because it's no longer his to define.  Like art or any other work, once it's released, it's out of the author's control and hands.  ""Bitcoin"" is whatever the community defines it as.  Nobody, not even Satoshi, and not even you, gets to declare that their vision is the correct vision and Bitcoin is only what they say it is.

Second point: There are valid security concerns relating to blocksize -- all the standard things Core says may be tired and annoying to hear, but they are valid arguments.  It is also valid to claim that the blocksize is part of the scarcity of Bitcoin.  Just because your or I happen to disagree with all those arguments doesn't in itself negate them.  Those visions and views of what Bitcoin is are just as valid as yours.  If you're using the white paper as your definition, as you seem to be, then as I pointed out previously (numerous times), there's nothing that says 1mb blocks can't be Bitcoin.  They certainly have been for the first 8 years.

I forget what my third point was, but the above two will suffice.  The community defines what Bitcoin is, not you and not Satoshi.  And even if we go by the white paper, it doesn't mention any of the stuff you posted.

fixed that for you

He wrote the white paper.
BTC is not what is described as Bitcoin.
BCH is.

that's all there is to it

> When somebody says ""fuck the users, we're doing things this way"",

straw man argument

No one is saying F the users.  You could make a valid case that by selling people BTC when they want to buy what Bitcoin was 3 years ago is misleading new investors.  Actually, that is happening on a huge scale and it happens every day.

> The Bitcoin of the white paper says nothing about block size,

Straight blockstream propaganda.  Blockstream/core tell us that if you raise the block size today, Bitcoin is somehow doomed tomorrow because it can't compete on Visa level transactions today.

""Long before the network gets anywhere near as large as that, it would be safe 
for users to use Simplified Payment Verification (section 8) to check for 
double spending, which only requires having the chain of block headers, or 
about 12KB per day.  **Only people trying to create new coins would need to run 
network nodes.  At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the 
network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to 
specialists with server farms of specialized hardware.  A server farm would 
only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with 
that one node.**

""The bandwidth might not be as prohibitive as you think.  A typical transaction 
would be about 400 bytes (ECC is nicely compact).  Each transaction has to be 
broadcast twice, so lets say 1KB per transaction.  Visa processed 37 billion 
transactions in FY2008, or an average of 100 million transactions per day.  
That many transactions would take 100GB of bandwidth, or the size of 12 DVD or 
2 HD quality movies, or about $18 worth of bandwidth at current prices.

**""If the network were to get that big, it would take several years, and by then, 
sending 2 HD movies over the Internet would probably not seem like a big deal.""**

"Here is the message:

> In August 2017, Bitcoin forked into two variants. These have taken radically different paths.

> Looking at the situation one quarter later, it is clear to us that the Blockstream fork of bitcoin diverges so radically from the ideas presented in the Bitcoin white paper, that it is an evolutionary dead end. While it may still have high trading value, as a mere collectible of curiosity, the Blockstream fork of bitcoin is not part of building any future financial infrastructure, which is what Block Explorer is about.

> A currency of the future has subcent optional usage fees and instant transactions. The Blockstream fork of Bitcoin (""Bitcoin Legacy"") is at $20 usage fees and rising, with no end in sight, and can take days to confirm, despite unfulfilled promises to the contrary on both points when Segwit activated in what can only be described as a community fistfight. We are therefore making the decision to consider the Blockstream fork deprecated, and support it as legacy technology only.

> Rather, we have made the decision to support the only bitcoin fork with a postive utility momentum, which is Bitcoin Cash. We took an early decision to deploy a Bitcoin Cash block explorer and will continue to roll out related services. We are also deploying tools for other cryptocurrencies we find on a positive momentum path, such as ZCash, which have increased privacy value.

> We will not add future support for the Blockstream fork of bitcoin (""Bitcoin Legacy""), and will be deprecating it entirely at some future point in time to be determined. Developments have revealed it to be a dead end. At such a time, we will refer to Bitcoin Cash as Bitcoin only, but will make some effort to not break API calls by changing URLs of legacy automated systems.
