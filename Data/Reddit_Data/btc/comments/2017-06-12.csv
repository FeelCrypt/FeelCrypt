"> Then the mod (very mistakenly) labeled a potential fork of Bitcoin as an alt? Is that correct?

Yes. not rationally though. I was banned for saying Bitcoin XT can't be an altcoin, as it writes valid bitcoin transactions to the blockchain that are considers valid by the bitcoin network. 

Talking about implementations that removed the 1MB limit was banned, only if it was officially on-topic acording to the Core mailing list and IRC was it allowed (excluding cat videos and price speculation) . (rules there also prohibited the discusion of a >1MB fork where moderated on the IRC and even bitcointalk.org aswell.) 

Only implementations that followed the the lead implementation rules set was allowed, the notion of a single official implementation is the very definition of centralized control. Ways to remove the 1MB limit involving old nodes to upgrade was banned. 

I was initially banned for 1 year for criticizing the censorship (after my first two infractions). My first ban was for promoting the idea of increasing the transaction capacity, I was sensitive to the notion one could not discuss XT. I was also banned for down voting a comment by nullc - i clicked on a link from r/btc and the reddit admin banned everyone, reddit wide for down voting nullc. 

>In that case, that Mod is the problem. I don't think they were purposefully being malicious though. 

botoin.org,
Bitcoin IRC
bitcoinwiky,
r/bitcoin,
bitcointalk.org, all censored discussion and projected a vision that was hostile to any implementation other than Core. it looks malicious, its not just r/bitcoin 

>As a side not... why will this sub not let me post any quicker than 4 minutes apart?

reddit had a default setting to prevent toxic trolling, if you are continuously down voted and don't have a positive karma in the sub you are rate limited. that default setting is still active on r/btc.

"Thanks for that, that's pretty messed up!
It's definitely damaged Bitcoin I would say. 

That kind of explains why the 'mood' in this sub is pretty heavy.

To an outsider, you all (initially) look like a bunch of crazy folk!.
 
However, it's only through r/btc that I read about how powerful the competition had become (from alts)!!. 
How are you supposed to defend your lead, if you can't discuss the competition?!!!

Really weird to think that the future of bitcoin has been jeopardised by one or two 'religious' nuts who control various forums.

"It is crazy, lots of social engendering going on, a lot of the trolls here just agitate and radicalize people banned from r/bitcoin. 

I've noticed that whenever a coherent argument materializes a new bunch of people get banned from r/bitcoin come over here and a bunch of agitators hijack the conversation and derail the conversation. 

what makes this place particularly crazy is there is no heavy moderation, it's all user voting (even voting probably) 

it's not moderated to avoid criticism the idea is this is a free space no moderation, so it's abused. the only moderation tool is the default rate limit.

If chain growth resulting from block size growth causes problem across the GFC, then (A) perhaps when miners start getting blocks orphaned by an important exchange the problem will resolve quickly (B) maybe miners will feel a need to geographically decentralize or (C) the network can take the hit *at that time* if that day comes.;1;1;False;jessquit;ditcykx;"Average Bitcoin transaction fee is now above five dollars. 80% of the world population lives on less than $10 a day.

"Its not aboiut small and b blocks , if BTC is unchageble and IN REVERSIBLE that makes it the best as a store of value.
It will not die gold did not die eighter.
this will be virtual gold ,, and a chacn split forget about it , the people resposible have to hide them self for the rest of there lives!
The power of bitcoin is the current status quo :) yes it will be high fees , but if yoiu beed to spend you can use coins like litecoin.
if you need to store you use BTC.
so big blocks will not be needed https://bitcoinfees.21.co/
on chain is not needed because this will come in august,
https://twitter.com/KimDotcom/status/871755323849154561 no need for any encrease of on chain capasaty.
outside sigwit and BU are a ton of creative solutions.
that will make BTC very easy to transfer to faster but less secure coins
so bitcoin will be $100.000 soon.

"If you need to limit bitcoin transaction capacity to make it a reserve currency / asset bitcoin is going to die. 

It's always been that it's not going to change when we remove the transaction limit.
