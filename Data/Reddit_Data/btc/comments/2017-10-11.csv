"This started a bit more than a week ago. I've re-submitted the ad for approval three times, and been rejected three times, each time they send me a form response:

I've also emailed them and opened support tickets and been ignored. Only out of frustration am I posting this here.

They haven't responded at all to support tickets in over a week?  That's extremely poor customer service, especially since you're completely in the right.  These are not advertisements for any type of security, financial assets, or financial advice.  They're advertisements for a subreddit that discusses Bitcoin and related cryptocurrencies.  It's pretty ironic that Reddit accepts Bitcoin as payment for Gold and yet for some reason they don't want there to be ads for subreddits which discuss that.  And, as you point out, Reddit allows plenty of ads which are explicitly asking users to purchase securities.;17;0;False;gotamd;do897sh;Reddit now rejecting all my ads for /r/btc and ignoring my support tickets about it.;75qde1;https://i.imgur.com/aZHXUQz.png

"So support for Bitcoin Cash, despite it not being accepted (i.e. simply sold off, price under 10% of Bitcoin) by the majority of users outside this sub is fine.  Support for 2x is fine, but support for Bitcoin as we know it isn't fine?  That's trolling?  How is the minority support for BCH not trolling by that logic?

In many ways, when both sides cannot agree on something, either propose another solution or accept the status quo.  That's the part of Bitcoin that's so good, if we can't agree on something, then it doesn't get implemented, it's like a safe fallback.

"> they are just that stupid, their service is outsourced to some foreign country guaranteed, and the employees have very little training or reading comprehension.

I've been a moderator of several small communities in the past and always had a reddit admin contact me using perfect English. They were quite helpful in rooting out a few troll spammers who were dodging bans in my sub around a year ago. The service was pretty slow and awful – like 3-month turnaround times on support requests – around 2014. They did a bunch of hiring and beefed up the support system in 2016. Response times are down to 24-48 hours, last I checked.

There are a lot of people split between bitcoin and 2x, labelling bitcoin (current rules) supporters as trolls is just typical of this sub.
