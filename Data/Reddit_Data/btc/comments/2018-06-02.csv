"> The casual user will in no way do all that shit just to use Bitcoin. People like ease of use.

On that we are in complete agreement.  And I fully expect the crypto community to make their tools better and easier over time, regardless of the laws of any particular jurisdiction.  Pirating music and movies was also difficult and slow early on, in addition to being illegal, and yet the illegality of it has not stopped it, but rather the ease of doing it has made it even more prevalent.

It may be annoying to circumvent government regulations *now*, but if the community at large values bypassing those regulations, the software will be developed to make doing just that easier and easier.

Again, this is not a moral judgment, this is simple economics.  If the technology is valuable, then it will find a way to be used.  Either people who need it will take the risk, or people who care about it will make it easier to use.";2;1;False;exmachinalibertas;dzz5yjo;This is governments trying to regulate bitcoin.;https://v.redd.it/ir2g5g3wgz011
You must be aware that reproductive rates are dropping and that for some countries population decline has set in yes? You surely must be aware what that means for a fiat based deficit spending economy that counts on a growing GDP driven by a population growth of the future in order to make the future pay for present expenses...;0;1;False;pyalot;e00d3nf;This is governments trying to regulate bitcoin.;https://v.redd.it/ir2g5g3wgz011

"Here's a question for you. All over the western world governments are enacting wild immigration policies designed to get as many foreigners into the respective countries as possible. Ostensibly they're doing that to combat the decline in native populations on account low reproduction. They're doing that despite knowing that it'll tear the social fabric apart, that it can have all kinds of unintended consquences (such as drastic increase in all kinds of crime), that the wellfare systems cannot handle this amount of immigration and so forth. Naturally they're trying to censor as much of the negative effects as possible to the detriment of their native citizens.

It begs the question, if reproductive rates are the problem, why aren't they trying to figure out why and how to fix it? Is it because:

1. That thought hasn't occurred to them?
2. They know what the problem is, but can't fix it? (how do they know the imported populations won't develop the same problem?)
3. They can fix it, but choose not to and instead import a population?

Which of these possible answers to you find more frightening?";1;1;False;pyalot;e00966r;This is governments trying to regulate bitcoin.;https://v.redd.it/ir2g5g3wgz011

Yeah... thats not kinda true. I was true years ago because no one gave a shit but current in some countries you can get warned and then fined for pirating shit.";1;0;False;ZmSyzjSvOakTclQW;dzzw8ba;This is governments trying to regulate bitcoin.;https://v.redd.it/ir2g5g3wgz011

Since there are only 1500 properties so far, I think it would be nice to have a static map.
