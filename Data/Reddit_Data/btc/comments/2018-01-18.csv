"You are correct.  The best tools will not see the best gains in a speculative market.  I think they will still be safe bets, even if not the biggest returns.  Most people with skin in the game just want to make money from it and while I do enjoy easy returns in what appears to be the best gambling opportunity of my life time (hard to make bad picks in this market!) I would also be stoked if we just changed the world with useful technology innovations even if there was no money to be made and value was stable.

That being said, nothing will be stable in fiat value unless backed by fiat and therefore centralized, so a roller coaster it will be, and value keeps going up on finite things that have lower emission rates than adoption, and we're still in early adoption times, so market will continue to go up inevitably... and if stable value is out of the question, better up than down, so, so be it!  I think the good tech will be more likely to do well over multiple years though, while shitcoins will come and go.

In the event of another actual bear market (like 2014) I expect a lot of subpar alts to lose a lot of market cap to bitcoin and the good alts that have good tech for their use cases (while everything goes down for a while) but I don't know if such a bear market is going to happen any time soon.

2017 was altcoin boom, with a lot of people reliving early Bitcoin gains (or experiencing them for the first time if they missed out on early Bitcoin days)

2018 I'm hoping will be the year that decentralized exchanges really kick off and go mainstream.  Time will tell.  2018 could also just be a continuation of the alt boom.";1;0;False;jjones4coin;dsvlie1;Death of a Scamcoin: r/Bitconnect's front page screenshotted moments before they went private, showing panic, anger, and lots of ill-advised investment claims, several claiming to have lost over $100k;https://imgur.com/a/TLimM

BCH vs BTC my opinion is that I'm not qualified to have an opinion about the security implications of LN or sidechains, that BCH is more practical right now, and that LN may or may not change that.  I also see conflicts of interest on both sides, but cannot know if either side is actually acting based on those interests or if they're just doing what they think is right.  I'm content letting the market decide and seeing how things pan out.  I'm passionate about privacy tech though because some people actually rely on it and I'd hate to see anyone rely on a false sense of security and have it fail them.;1;1;False;jjones4coin;dsvqf78;Death of a Scamcoin: r/Bitconnect's front page screenshotted moments before they went private, showing panic, anger, and lots of ill-advised investment claims, several claiming to have lost over $100k;https://imgur.com/a/TLimM

Look from another perspective in a larger time frame instead. Do you think you can really say xvg is a Ponzi scheme like bitconnect?

"All currency needs to have a central agency to prevent the value of the currency to spike. This is usually done by printing more money to get people to spend money rather than hoarding them. This is kinda difficult with crypto currency.  
Also currency needs some sort of backup in case of hyper inflation. Most countries have a large supply of gold, other currencies etc. In order to buy up large quantities of cash. Again, difficult with crypto currency.  
Since there is a limited supply of it, there will always be spikes, people start hoarding until it's starting to turn. Then everyone tries to liquidise their stock and the value crashes. When the pound was introduced in old England, it had the exact same issues.  
My guess this is just a mix of difficult to regulate and baby issues.

I get what you're saying and my admittedly subjective opinion is that there are a lot of cryptocurrencies created not to innovate but to cash in on growth and I see little reason to believe that Verge is not one of them.  Any crypto that is supposed to be better for a certain use case should have devs telling you why, and the reasons that I see verge promoters citing is that they've done two things that have been done before, while a bunch of others have gone much further.

"**Straw man**

A straw man is a common form of argument and is an informal fallacy based on giving the impression of refuting an opponent's argument, while actually refuting an argument that was not presented by that opponent. One who engages in this fallacy is said to be ""attacking a straw man"".

The typical straw man argument creates the illusion of having completely refuted or defeated an opponent's proposition through the covert replacement of it with a different proposition (i.e., ""stand up a straw man"") and the subsequent refutation of that false argument (""knock down a straw man"") instead of the opponent's proposition.

This technique has been used throughout history in polemical debate, particularly in arguments about highly charged emotional issues where a fiery ""battle"" and the defeat of an ""enemy"" may be more valued than critical thinking or an understanding of both sides of the issue.

The problem you seem to be blind about is that if core had just raised the block limit to 8MB, the system would stack again exactly how we are now in 1-2 years, when it reaches more than 2.5 millions transactions/day, or 30 tps


Then what? Increase the blocksize again? At the cost of fewer and fewer full nodes and a weak centralized network? We believe this is not worth it, cause, if increase the blocksize is the solution to all scalability problems, we will end up with blocks of 10GB every 10 minutes and a complete useless network (for that)

Make whatever argument you like about why BCH is 'superior' to Bitcoin. The fact is, Roger Ver has an army of Twitter shills at his disposal, and he purchased that Twitter account to shill BCH as the *real* Bitcoin. There are also mounting concerns that he is responsible for clogging BTC & ETH networks with empty transactions just to make them seem slower than Bcash.

If it were truly superior, it would stand on its own merits. It hasn't. With incredibly low adoption, it is already slower than two turtles fucking in the snow in a pool of molasses. Not buying it.

In my personal opinion, BCH should also work on off-chain scaling, since stuff like Segwit has several advantages besides just the increase in transaction output.

"I think it is predatory to sell your relatives on crypto. You have to be honest with them about the volatile nature of crypto-currencies at least if you do. I have let my dad and sister know about my holdings. But I do not pitch it to them. Bitcoin at one point earlier today dropped over 50% from the all-time high while i was sleeping. And the alts pretty much all dropped even further down.

My dad is content with just sticking with mutual funds and my sister is content with just sticking to real estate. The volatility of crypto is too crazy for them to handle. My dad can't understand why I'm not even mad that my blockfolio dropped a shit ton in value. I had paper profits, now my paper profits took a hair cut. Basically it. That profit wasn't even real and it doesn't become real until you sell for cash or goods and services. If I sold my stack, I had no way of knowing what the top was anyways. I could have sold my entire stack too early and then have a difficult time buying back low. Day trading in that way is risky. I day trade but only in a very conservative way where the risk of making the wrong move is very low (but still possible). I'm not gonna get mad over money I didn't actually lose. I've cashed out my initial investment a long time ago. I am hodling because the crypto market could have another bull run one day. Just like how it had another bull run after a 2 year dark age.";5;1;False;markdidnothingwrong;dsukcb2;Grandpa gets to learn what HODL means;https://i.redd.it/iksha8i7dna01.jpg

"**Poe's law**

Poe's law is an adage of Internet culture stating that, without a clear indicator of the author's intent, it is impossible to create a parody of extreme views so obviously exaggerated that it cannot be mistaken by some readers or viewers as a sincere expression of the parodied views.

The original statement of the adage, by Nathan Poe, was:



Without a winking smiley or other blatant display of humor, it is utterly impossible to parody a Creationist in such a way that someone won't mistake for the genuine article.

I'm sorry to say, but they've lied to you, you're not special, you're just ""*special*"". Women don't need people being assholes in their name; by being such a spoiled brat, you're hurting the fight for equality, you're a living caricature. Go do research, there is a lot of lies spread by SJWs to make  you do their bidding. SJWs don't fight for justice, they don't fight for equality; they say they do, but if you actually study what they do in practice, they're fighting for increased privilege and for the right to oppress those that don't kiss their ass.

It's a funny thing, you guys at the same time worship victims but also do a hell lot to harm them. You wanna know something? I don't believe you guys really care for victims, you just want to use them as shields and  pretend to be victims yourselves to get special treatment.

In the same regard, you could say that you have to monitor the Bitcoin network to see if a there is a published LN transaction that is not the most recent. If you detect this, you would need to outspend the opposing transaction's fee to ensure your transaction gets in the block instead of theirs. But even if your transaction has a higher fee, there is nothing that ensures that the miner chooses your transaction, just as there is nothing that ensures a miner doesn't choose a higher fee double spend transactions.

Back when I was following things more closely, I didn't realize I wasn't just gonna be learning, but I would need to be teaching people as well; that, together with my lack of organization resulted in me not keeping bookmarks of the thousands of important pieces of information I saw, and I don't have the spare time anymore to browse thru thousands of pages looking for specific links, back then it would take a good part of the day just to keep up with what had been posted since the previous day.

And that same site has the average BCH fee at something like 50 cents. Is that accurate? Technically yes, but it's incredibly misleading. People and businesses overpay transactions fees allllll the time. BCH can you get transactions confirmed for under a cent, so I don't then tell people it costs $.50 to do a BCH transaction.

"If transactions ""fall out"" of the mempool regularly you have to then estimate the future to decide if it's likely that that fee may ""fall out"" and not confirm sometime in the future; allowing the inputs to be replaced by a future fee.

another use case is something like pay per second/minute services like camshows

there are endless scenarios where something like LN makes total sense vs spamming the mainchain (and much much faster and cheaper)

"dude.. 

second layer is great for many use cases like sending money back and forth between entities like exchanges for example. 

WHAT IS NOT OK is to have ONLY layer 2 as a means of transacting. Most people here agree on this. BTC core is fucked because they are making L2 the only way to send pretty much without huge fees. It wont work.

"No. For the following reasons:

[1] Linus Torvalds did not market the distribution to you.
[2] The bug was NOT deliberate and with the intent of causing damage.

However in the case of LN being rushed you have the following:

[1]  The knowledge that LN is not ready.  You have evidence of this via the twitter thread.  Thus you can show *intent*

[2] LN Labs would have committed intent to defraud the public once again have the knowledge that LN is not ready.

The key difference in your strawman and LN is *intent* to market an inferior product that causes harm to the public.

Until a transaction is in a block a double spend is always possible. Someone can broadcast a transaction with a given fee to the network and then send a transaction spending the same outputs to a different address directly to miners so the rest of the network doesn't know about it until the next block is mined. It may not be happening a lot now, but profit maximizing miners can decide to assist double spends in this manner at any moment. ;2;0;False;forwardleft;dsuctew;Elizabeth Stark of Lightning labs calls out Blockstream on letting users tinker with LN that's neither safe nor ready for mainnet.;https://i.redd.it/oxntkr1xema01.png
"For the revocation transaction, you actually have a lot more time to get your transaction confirmed. The contract is set up so that if the other peer pushes an old channel state, he has to wait for the time lock to expire before he can claim the channel funds. But you can access them immediately, and you can use his channel funds to pay for the transaction fees. This will get you confirmed quickly, assuming that your channel was opened with funding greater than N-times the current next block fee.

I guess one thing to note is that if the peer received ""stuff"" in exchange for payment, then the max fee you can set before losing money is equivalent to the (initial channel funding sats - total sats paid by peer in). One way to mitigate this would be to reject payments for stuff if the max fee exceeds some multiple of the next block confirm fee.

As far as the miner not including your revocation transaction, this would be unlikely to me since you'd be putting such a high fee on the transaction. The miners would have to collude, since if one doesn't pick up your tx, then another one should.";1;0;False;0xHUEHUE;dsurkpw;Elizabeth Stark of Lightning labs calls out Blockstream on letting users tinker with LN that's neither safe nor ready for mainnet.;https://i.redd.it/oxntkr1xema01.png
