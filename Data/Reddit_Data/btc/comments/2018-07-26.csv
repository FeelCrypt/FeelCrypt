">Parallel construction obviously being the preferred method of taking out a target while maintaining the veil of secrecy surrounding the very mechanism which was used to make the target known.

Thanks for the upvote. Yes it's truly an Orwellian/Machiavellian environment when government agents are free to absolutely make up stories and lie under oath, merely to prosecute victimless drug crimes. Of course cops have been lying for years when they want to nail somebody, but this is lending high-level legitmacy to this practice.

"> he facilitated the trafficking of literal tons of dangerous drugs.

Much of which would have happened anyway. A bootlegger during Prohibition ""facilitated the trafficking of literal tons of alcohol"", we saw how that all worked out.

> There is no doubt many OD's and deaths that were a direct result of his actions.

First of all, you have zero evidence for this, and basing your bullshit on facts is step 1. Second of all, if drugs were permitted to be traded and simply regulated, then far fewer overdoses would occur. Thirdly... *His* actions? Nobody forced the drug users to overdose on the drugs. You going to blame the Dole Food Company for all the sugarcane they harvest and which ends up in foods causing the overweight epidemic? Or maybe the grocery store ""facilitating in the trafficking of sugar""? How about blaming car manufacturers for every automobile death? After all, there would be no car crashes if cars didn't exist! Personal accountability and responsibility are things. And anyway, the problem is not drugs per se, drug addicts [are just people self-medicating because of some other problem in their lives](https://www.verywellmind.com/the-self-medication-theory-of-addiction-21933).";1;1;False;ABC_AlwaysBeCoding;e332vvn;"Free_Ross on Twitter: ""ALL charges of murder-for-hire vs. Ross are now dropped.

I was referring to the crypto community, not just you. I'm just telling you why he was given life in jail, it's not some government conspiracy, he facilitated the trafficking of literal tons of dangerous drugs.

"You're losing credibility here because except for your comment about 10 year olds buying drugs (a fair criticism, probably rectifiable somehow without resorting to ""do you own a credit card?"" which just passes that buck to them while also eliminating anonymity), all the other things you said were addressed by the data.

Another thing you of course fail to consider is good actors for example needing drugs that are not available to them via regulated channels due to extreme pricing, they could go on an anonymous marketplace and get those needed drugs cheap.

Hint: If the data doesn't agree with your worldview, that usually means your worldview needs adjusting.

The point about the cartels regaining power when a safer and cheaper option went away should have been completely self-evident, but the data supporting that notion [comes straight from what happened with Prohibition](http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=1017&full=1):  The homicide rate increased from 6 per 100,000 in the pre-Prohibition period to nearly 10 per 100,000 in 1933. That trend was reversed by the 1933 repeal of Prohibition. The same is true for many other crimes, as well.

If you fail to realize the lesson, there, that's not my fault, that is just your ignorance.

I personally don't give a shit what internet money drug traffickers use because ""not using fiat currency"" is not the problem: the drug war is, just like the alcohol war was before it. I don't currently even own any crypto, so stop fucking pigeonholing me as ""the crypto community,"" because if you actually had a good argument (such as the age one, above... a legit concern), I'd acknowledge it.";1;1;False;ABC_AlwaysBeCoding;e32qdrc;"Free_Ross on Twitter: ""ALL charges of murder-for-hire vs. Ross are now dropped.

None of what you said changes the fact that drugs are illegal, and dangerous drugs are illegal for good reason. Distributors get punished more than users, so naturally by being a huge distributor he got the boot thrown at him. ;1;0;False;top_kek_top;e334mxx;"Free_Ross on Twitter: ""ALL charges of murder-for-hire vs. Ross are now dropped.
