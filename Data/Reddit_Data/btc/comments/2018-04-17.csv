You may want to get educated on the very basics of Bitcoin, because even though you have people supporting this thinking, the majority of people who have been studying Bitcoin for a few years are just shaking their heads.

Satoshi - 2008-11-08:

“The fact that new coins are produced means the money supply increases by a planned amount, but this does not necessarily result in inflation. If the supply of money increases at the same rate that the number of people using it increases, prices remain stable. If it does not increase as fast as demand, there will be deflation and early holders of money will see its value increase.

I don't use Twitter, I have no knowledge of what that hashtag was used for before this conversation. Let me tell you, saying #metoo doesn't mean what twitter says it means.

Read Roger's post, it's okay I'll wait, done? Great. Let's go through it together, so we are both on the same page as to what the words ""me too"" mean.

> @Falkvinge, the man who had the vision to go all in on bitcoin in 2011 is one of Bitcoin Cash’s biggest supporters today. #MeToo

So Roger is referring to someone else, and then praising them on something they have done, or an attitude they have towards a belief or cause. He also points out that he has similar views/attitude as the person he is praising because he writes ""me too"".

So if I make a tweet RIGHT NOW saying;
> @benandjerries always had such good taste in ice cream, best ideas for flavors ever #metoo

Does this mean I support rape, or does this mean I also believe I have good taste in ice cream.

nice propaganda tactic. what happened was that there were *many more* people supporting segwit and hesitant to do a hard fork. the moment bch crowd decided to fork off - it became an altcoin discussion.

nobody was silenced *because of their opinion on scaling*, people still talk about scaling tradeoffs on r/bitcoin without getting banned. it's the moment when you start promoting a forked coin as a bitcoin that gets you into ban territory.

"despite 40% market dominance?

You realize that it was 100% first? Then 90%. Then 80%. Then 70%. Then 60-50-40% with a brief foray into the 30’s. ";6;1;False;identicalBadger;dxi4w3t;BTC Supporters........;https://i.redd.it/tq1w0blj4fs01.png
"Why is it always somebody who’s only been around for a year that thinks BCH is a joke?

We’ve all been here since 2012 or earlier, and Satoshi‘s right-hand man Gavin Andresen even supports BCH. As does Vitalik Buterin, creator of Ethereum, Coinbase, Gemini soon, and the biggest merchant processing company in the entire bitcoin world. BitPay.

Are they all drinking the Kool-Aid as well? Or do you actually think you know better than every one of them?";20;0;False;BitttBurger;dxi5x7v;BTC Supporters........;https://i.redd.it/tq1w0blj4fs01.png

"Saying there are paid sockpuppets in crypto is about as accurate as right-wingers crying ""paid protestors"" every time they see a dem with a sign. These are INVESTORS with invested money riding on a crypto (BTC, in this case). Just like yall, they claim their invested crypto is better. Please stop with this claim that the other side is ""paid off,"" it undermines the legitimacy of the whole cryptosphere.

Edit: I'm defending crypto and getting downvoted. Wtf is this sub.";7;3;False;almostaverageplayer;dxin8f4;BTC Supporters........;https://i.redd.it/tq1w0blj4fs01.png
"I mean it’s pretty obvious he knew. If you look at every reply in that thread they all knew exactly what he meant and they’re all calling him out on it. 

I think you’re really over exaggerating how much effort I put into disliking him. I don’t hate him “so much”. he’s just a shit person and he annoys me 90% of the time I see him post anything on Reddit so I like to call him out when it comes up. 

Honestly people like you annoy me way more than he does anyways. ";1;1;False;bahkins313;dxijs2c;BTC Supporters........;https://i.redd.it/tq1w0blj4fs01.png
