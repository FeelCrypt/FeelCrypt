"Hi, u/sockpuppet2001, sorry for the delayed response.

Regarding your example, it is not noted as ""[removed]""; this is correctly observed. The reason is not due to CSS ""dishonest fuckery"", however. The reason is due to standard Reddit behavior, where removal of the last comment in a ""comment thread"" does not result in that notification. Otherwise, it shows the standard ""[removed]"" indication, as you see from my earlier screenshot.

Regarding ""mods programmed a bot to hide opinions they didn't want people to hear about"" -- this is not true. The reason is not nefarious, but rather standard r/bitcoin policy to have a moderated subreddit that is useful and desired by its subscribers.

As such, as an example, conspiracy theories about Blockstream are removed, sure, simply because this is a topic that has been exhausted since it was first broached more than 1 year ago. This topic has never had any evidence to back it up, and all manner of nonsense about it (e.g. Blockstream is restricting on-chain capacity so that it profits from LN -- utter nonsense, because a) LN is a public layer 2 network that any entity (individual, company, whatever) can run - not exclusive to Blockstream, b) Blockstream is in favor of segwit (which is on-chain scaling regardless of the cries otherwise -- it's just on-chain scaling in the form of a soft-fork, instead of the typically presented hard-fork), c) etc. (I could go on).

So, while r/btc is happy to allow all kinds of ""spammy"" and noise-filled attacks and conspiracies, this is not the purpose of r/bitcoin. This would not be useful for Bitcoin, and if one wants that kind of ""news"", they can go to r/btc with its selectively-lax policies. r/bitcoin is a source of news and discussion whose goal is to operate in the best interests of Bitcoin (this includes no news that pumps altcoins).

As for r/bitcoin not ""hiding posts for any nobler reason than to manipulate opinion"" -- theymos certainly does dictate the over-arching rules, such as no promotion of clients that lack overwhelming technical consensus, but you should not misinterpret his words. His intention is to do what he think is best for Bitcoin, from his perspective. By the way, his position has moderated quite a bit from the initial positions from a year ago when things became most heated. Obviously he made mistakes (and I spoke about it earlier), but who does not make mistakes? It's time to stop the crucifixion.

Imagine the comparison of theymos vs. Roger Ver. Roger owns r/btc, and he actually has financial interest here, as he profits by promoting his web properties (such as bitcoin.com). In contrast, theymos does not financially profit from r/bitcoin. When you really think about it, theymos is a bit of a saint and far more trustworthy vs. Roger (Roger being a person who is quite involved with Bitcoin business world, and has investments in all kinds of those companies whose interests he claims to look out for -- a primary reason why he wants block size increased a lot btw... so the fee is reduced, so those companies don't have to reduce their profit by paying higher fees. <-- This has always been admitted by Gavin, who only cared to increase block size so the companies he works with can make their business model work better. Normal users who want to use BTC for the purpose it exists for (digital gold that is censorship-resistant and decentralized) don't usually care whether they pay 5 cents or 10 cents or 15 cents. But, when a company must pay fees in high volume, this adds up.

Also, subreddit policy has nothing to do with manipulating opinion... it is certainly moderated, but the purpose is as stated earlier: acting in Bitcoin's best interests. Included in this is not the endless conspiracies and attacks and pumping of altcoins that is implicitly promoted by r/btc mods.

If you want to talk about ""manipulating opinion"", this is actually done by various social media attackers who create new accounts to post and vote on r/bitcoin -- and various examples of actual vote manipulation, which has been aimed at downvoting certain people and upvoting certain others. Mods on r/bitcoin have had to deal with such attempts at manipulation for a long time (this is one of the reasons for the CSS that auto-expands all downvote-buried comments).

P.S. When you referred to me as ""wormtongue"" in a prior comment, that's a bit of an unfortunate characterization. I'm trying to be honest with you here. Believe it or not, you and I are far more likely to be on the ""same side"" here, as far as what we both *ultimately* want for Bitcoin. People like Roger Ver (who invest in numerous altcoins (conflict of interest vs. their BTC investment), as well as companies that act as middlemen -- which were never the point of BTC... BTC serves to disintermediate intermediaries, remember!) are not your white knights. People like you and me, who (caveat: I am assuming this about you) primarily focus on BTC and are normal individuals concerned about BTC remaining a source of freedom for the world, are far more aligned in reality. This false division between us is a result of politics, personal grudges, and perhaps conflicts of interest between others.";1;0;False;eragmus;daqzzk7;With the public spotlight on Reddit censorship, now would be the perfect time to let the rest of Reddit know about the censorship on /r/bitcoin;5eqvhs;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5eqvhs/with_the_public_spotlight_on_reddit_censorship/
