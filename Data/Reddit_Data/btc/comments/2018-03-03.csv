"You mean after a bunch of people took out loans they couldn't afford and fucked over everyone else in 2008. Sure, the banks could've been more scrutinizing in who they handed out loans to, but that wouldn't be an issue if people didn't think they could just take out loans and never pay them off.

Capitalism is a tool that can be controlled by the people with $$$. If you do not support a service with your $$$, the service must change to be something you will support.

"Yeah, using it as a currency in present US Tax Law is essentially infeasible per above. I was putting up with it but after this year of taxes, I'm way less inclined. I really hope regulation comes around.

The Euro is treated as an actual currency, not a commodity/property like cryptocurrency, so completely different set of allowances and rules. And even if it was treated the same, in the worst case scenario what was your gain/loss from the time you got the Euro to the time you used it? Cryptocurrency could double or halve in value easily in a week. The Euro has never doubled or halved in value... Ever?

So the gain/loss would be neglible unless you're dealing with tens of thousands of dollars worth. This is like 2015/2016; I didn't do the legwork on the Shift card because the gains/losses would be close to a wash. If the IRS wanted to ""get"" me on it, it would be weeks of work to, at best, source under $100 of unreported gains (and probably actually a loss instead). 2017 was almost pure gains (Bitcoin went 20x!) so I definitely needed to do it right.";1;0;False;xioustic;dv3tclk;You Can Now Turn Bitcoin Cash Into Dollars With the BitPay Card;https://blog.bitpay.com/bitpay-card-bitcoin-cash/
"I don't think you could pay me enough to do all that fucking work again, lol. All of my accountants told me the legwork I did would have cost weeks of $200+/hr work from them.

I'm an independent software engineer already; I could reverse engineer Shift's app API for a proper export and I could reimplement basis tracking from Bitcoin.tax, but the niche is still small enough I don't think there would be good return on the effort. Maybe if I went to work for Coinbase or Shift.

"Man, this shit has to stop.

If you happened to have a stack of Euro for some reason, and held it for a bit, then spent it all in Europe on some later trip, the IRS wouldn't give two shits about the capital gains, even though technically they should.  I guess to some degree it's hard to argue it should be treated like a currency not an investment when you're selling to use fiat as the currency....";1;1;False;jessquit;dv3lsas;You Can Now Turn Bitcoin Cash Into Dollars With the BitPay Card;https://blog.bitpay.com/bitpay-card-bitcoin-cash/

"> along with telling people you are paying with this with a crypto

yeah for me this is critical to asking ""do you accept Bitcoin Cash"" in the first place.  99% of the time people are going to look at you like you're crazy to be asking the question.  When you can say, ""no problem, I can pay this way instead"" then suddenly you didn't get shut down, you routed around.  It makes the first question a lot easier to get the ""no"" on because it's not a stopper.";1;0;False;jessquit;dv3m2b8;You Can Now Turn Bitcoin Cash Into Dollars With the BitPay Card;https://blog.bitpay.com/bitpay-card-bitcoin-cash/

"Cointracking.info and Bitcoin.tax has you covered there as long as you only ever bought and sold on an exchange (since that means no external basis was established). It gets more complicated if there's more than one exchange but it's doable. Almost every exchange has an export function or API that one of those sites can interact with, so it's much closer to automated.

I suspect most day traders from last year / this year are either not paying taxes properly or at all. A lot of the theory I've heard from altcoin traders that have no tax law experience is to only track when you put in money and when you took it out and pay taxes on the difference, ignoring all interim trades in between regardless of if it's USD->crypto, crypto->crypto, or crypto->USD... That also implies a like-kind set of exchanges between cryptocurrencies which definitely does not hold up to IRS scrutiny... Yeah that's all definitely not going to fly if the IRS starts giving a shit; those are all separate events that must be tracked/reported individually and the basis of each asset tracked accurately.

If you made a ton of money altcoin trading last year it behooves you to get a good accountant, especially if you used a compliant exchange. I'm confident the IRS has a direct feed of data from those guys, either on request or automatic. The reason you don't know is because I don't believe the tax law is clear enough what forms the exchanges should be filing and how for each customer, so it's literally raw data on request.";1;0;False;xioustic;dv3y3eh;You Can Now Turn Bitcoin Cash Into Dollars With the BitPay Card;https://blog.bitpay.com/bitpay-card-bitcoin-cash/
