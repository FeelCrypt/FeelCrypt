That's why I listed those two last, but it is true. Google+ was amazing, but when you already hold the majority no one will want to switch. LTC will have a lot to offer when they move to Casper. But if Lightning Network drops before that, LTC will have nothing to offer before Bitcoin. ETH however will see value increase as we continue to see. Everyone told me it wouldn't break $400, and I'm now sitting happily in my money back as well as the same amount of Etherium. They have some scalability issues to solve as well, but it's better than BTC as the two stand today. XMR will continue to see growth as it is truly the anonymous crypto. I also believe LTC and BCH will continue to see growth despite lack of innovation compared to Bitcoin, as there's already a lot of money in both markets and crypto diversity will keep them alive. ;2;1;False;bhobhomb;drbb6lx;Guess who controls over half a billion Tethers across 3 exchanges—over 73% of USDT currently in circulation.;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7ih0hd/guess_who_controls_over_half_a_billion_tethers/
"The current leading libertarian candidate Austin Peterson calls for a 1% across the board cut in taxes; not a complete abolishment of the tax structure.

You're conflating one or two types of Libertarianism (Anarcho-capitalism/communism or Geo-libertarianism) to the entire Libertarian party.

In fact there are 11 different types of libertarians and only a portion of those would be against ownership taxes.  Minarchists and Classical liberals would strongly support ownership taxes but would want them very small and used for a small number of services.

That's why I'm watching ByteBall -- quite possibly the best platform/ecosystem for real commerce that I've seen. And they also offer anonymous transactions.

Maybe. I don't think BCH or LTC have much to offer in the long rune. They are better, but not 10x better, which they have to be to get people to switch.

"> The attack against SPV nodes in which they can mine invalid blocks allows them more than just double spends. They can rewrite the consensus rules and, for, example, create coins out of thin air.

They can create invalid blocks and trick SPV clients into accepting them. Whether the block pays the SPV wallet with stolen coins, already-spent coins, never-existed coins is immaterial. In all these cases the danger is that the person running an SPV wallet will accept the coins, then later discover they aren't valid and have been defrauded of funds. This is the exact same risk as accepting payment in a valid block that later gets orphaned.

In fact orphaning a chain is a better attack for a coaltion of majority-but-not-totality of hashpower. If they mine invalid blocks, they're out the block reward for each block (which cuts into their attack profits). If they orphan the chain mined by the honest miners they don't incurr this loss (instead they get the side-benefit of harming the honest miners).";1;1;False;christophe_biocca;drbc150;Type of memes that need to be r/bitcoin;https://i.redd.it/ntyz2w7iw2401.png

"What do you mean no use? It’s very useful to transfer high values even with the large fees. If you want to sell or buy something of high value you want to do that on the most secure chain with the biggest hashing power. BTC has 10x more hashing power with virtually no chance for a 51% attack. BCH’s chain can be rolled back by any medium sized miner at any time over and over if they want to. Any relatively small new mining entity could anonymously screw with BCH and nothing can be done about it. 

BTC also has 10x volume, processes 10x number of transactions per day, has 10x number of nodes. It would be crazy not to trust it more.

"Every fork is a contender in theory. Whichever fork has the most work behind it is Bitcoin. Given BTC has 1.54x more work accumulated already, it’s very hard to imagine how BCH can match and ever overtake BTC.

Also, the more time goes by the less likely BCH’s chain will ever be called BTC because of market and psychological reasons. This is especially true if companies like Bitpay and Coinbase introduce BCH under the Cash name. There is no turning back.

I think at this point the chances of ‘flippening’ are below a percent, and within a month or two it will be virtually zero. Whoever is counting on it is a huge risk taker, or delusional.

This doesn’t mean BCH can’t be a successful 3rd or 4th most used alt one day. ETH will be no. 1, LTC no.2 and BCH will compete with Dash, IOTA or others to be no. 3.

BTC in number of on-chain transactions will probably be 5th or 6th. However if counting Rootstock, LN and other off-chain transactions, and in volume, and in value transacted BTC will remain no. 1.

Not quite true. Nicehash sets a threshold of 0.01 BTC to withdraw to an external wallet, so most casual users would need to mine for a couple months before they're able to do that (and they're thus forced to store their BTC with Nicehash until that date). You can withdraw to your Nicehash online wallet for a threshold of 0.001 BTC instead, but then there's like a ~$10 or ~4% fee (whichever is higher) to move it into a real wallet, putting you back at square one.

You would make far more money , with a much gentler profit curve on BTC. BCH mining is also too erratic because of the quick over compensating DAA it has employed.

However, another pool hack is probable, but unlikely. You can just as well withdraw once at the end of the week and tilt the scales in your favor with not as a significant risk.

In the unlikely event that the pool you're mining in gets hacked, worst case scenario is you get set back a week, which in the grand scheme of things isn't that a big of a deal.

"If you insist on daily withdrawals you’re probably correct! But how little should you really trust pools, and how much do you really have to risk when considering less frequent withdrawals? Dozens of mining pools out there, many that have never been hacked after many years... this is a bit of an irrational fear to protect a couple hundred dollars of weekly returns that you would have with less frequent withdrawals.

That being said, at exactly equal profitability, i can see why BTC fees tip advantage to BCH... but that also tips the hashrate to it, reducing its profitability accordingly, canceling out this effect.

"> You can just as well withdraw once at the end of the week and tilt the scales in your favor with not as a significant risk.

Risk = impact x probability.

The impact of losing a week's worth of income (at this frail beginning of my business) means I go out of business. I need to pay rent, electricity, overhead, etc.

The probability is high because it already happened before.

The risk is therefore at the maximum possible value.
