"Since all non-neutral network traffic is [tortious interference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tortious_interference) by definition I don't see how it's possible to be pro free market and opposed to network neutrality (the concept, not any particular regulation called ""network neutrality"").

The ISPs have managed to confuse the issue past the point where most people even know what NN means in the first place.";0;0;False;Forlarren;e8rhgio;Ron Paul Calls for Exempting Cryptocurrencies from Capital Gains Tax;https://blockmanity.com/news/ron-paul-calls-for-exempting-cryptocurrencies-from-capital-gains-tax/
"That is true, there are a few exceptions, like using a foreign currency while in a foreign country or when donating stocks with unrealized capital gains to a charity. There is also technically no need to pay taxes when giving gifts, but the cost basis gets transferred to the recipient.

The taxes in the US are often not symmetrical, realized capital losses on personal use capital like cars are not tax deductible, while capital gains on the same car is taxable.

Crypto is symmetrical so there will on average over time be as much capital gain as loss for crypto users over the very long term (Inflation not counted).

The upside is that people that lose crypto by losing the private keys, hacked accounts, or sending it to the wrong address can get deductions on the cost basis that was lost.

Overall it is a detriment to people actually being able to keep and use crypto freely as they need to keep a record of all their transactions for tax purposes, unlike regular USD transactions which they can just do freely and forget about.";1;0;False;YouCanWhat;e8rqjgy;Ron Paul Calls for Exempting Cryptocurrencies from Capital Gains Tax;https://blockmanity.com/news/ron-paul-calls-for-exempting-cryptocurrencies-from-capital-gains-tax/
"Everyone crypto goes a little further, so does everyone's USD or Gold. Things getting cheaper or better is good, but does not count towards personal capital gains.

If crypto makes various industries boom, then it will be the investors in those industries and related industries that get the capital gains, not the people who have crypto.";1;0;False;YouCanWhat;e8rr7jv;Ron Paul Calls for Exempting Cryptocurrencies from Capital Gains Tax;https://blockmanity.com/news/ron-paul-calls-for-exempting-cryptocurrencies-from-capital-gains-tax/
