"Reading though the document again, its clear its not a contract or even creating a public license, its not structured as such, its basically just a promise not to sue you for infringing., and in that regard is likely worthless too.

>However, there are significant overhead costs that third parties do not want to take-- and in particular, we need assurances that if a patent attacker is going after Blockstream or our users, that the patents will be vigorously enforced against them as expressed in the defensive termination statement; otherwise the whole thing loses much of its value.

I think you're confused here. How would granting a transferable license to a third party cause them any overhead costs for that party, unless you were also trying to shift to them the burden of enforcing the patent (against who?) as a condition of receiving the benefit of it? Thats not necessary for the following reasons.

By granting a transferable license to multiple third parties unconditionally, what you're doing is creating an environment in which any one of those third parties could transfer the patent license to protect any user, from anyone that seeks to profit from the patent or similar patents, whether that is Blockstream with this patent or some kind of patent troll with another similar patent. By making the license as freely available as possible, you prevent patent trolling ipso facto. There is no need for ""vigorous enforcement"", only vigorous distribution of the license itself.

**The value is not in vigorously enforcing the patent, the value is in having the license be freely available to anyone that may have that patent or a similar patent used against them.**";1;1;False;Redpointist1212;dh0izpk;Blockstream having patents in Segwit makes all the weird pieces of the last three years fall perfectly into place;https://falkvinge.net/2017/05/01/blockstream-patents-segwit-makes-pieces-fall-place/

"The licenses are only available under DPL v1.1 (the patent pledge is not a license, and the IPA is only a license for the inventors), which requires that I make a specific request for a license from blockstream, and furthermore, the license is not transferable. While you might say thats easily available, its not exactly freely available either. How many people hold such licenses? You should have a count of them because they would have had to make specific requests to your company for each one.

Given the scenario that there are fully transferable licenses (which there are not currently), how exactly would IBM come after anyone for royalties on the patent? How does NOT giving out transferable licenses help here exactly? 

Edit:You need to realize that part of the reason people want these licenses open is to protect them from BLOCKSTREAM breaking their 'pledge' and using it against them, not just to prevent IBM from trying to patent the same thing, infact having the license transferable does not hurt that cause at all.


Edit2:
>or by bringing them to the table to get them to also open up patents in this space since their ability to enforce them would be limited.

So Blockstream wants to use the threat of their patents as leverage to entice other companies to make their patents more freely available as well. And we're just supposed to be content with the 'pledge' that blockstream wont use that leverage against us specifically. Making the licenses nontransferable helps give you that leverage? And if you gave a fully transferable license to the EFF you would no longer have that leverage? Sounds good for blockstream, not so good for people that dont trust blockstream. 

And it sounds like a borderline offensive use. Purely defensive use is simply patenting the idea so that trolls can't, and then distributing the rights to everyone. When you start talking about leverage for unrelated patents the lines get pretty blurred.

On SegWit, maybe. But as someone else said somewhere in here: How can we be sure that there's not another patent by a third entity on SegWit, that is just a shell company for example?

On the higher layers, there might indeed have been placed enough patent mines by Blockstream to make only them viable to do all the fancy higher layers (the ones that make money).

The document is not a contract, and so a signature would not make sense or have any legal significance. (It's more comparable to a license to the public--there are no signatures on licenses, but they are still enforceable grants of rights.) 

It's published on our website as a statement by the company, in the mass media etc. I linked to RedHat, Tesla, and Google earlier in this thread and, as you can see, none have ""signatures"". It just wouldn't make sense.

We'd like to do that too and planned to from the start (and in fact even my employment contract includes a part on assigning the patents to an external foundation). However, there are significant overhead costs that third parties do not want to take--and in particular, we need assurances that if a patent attacker is going after Blockstream or our users, that the patents will be vigorously enforced against them as expressed in the defensive termination statement; otherwise the whole thing loses much of its value. The best way to do this would be to get many participants in the industry to collaborate, but so far it's been slow going to get other parties to come along. 

In any case this is specifically called out in our FAQ.

Having not completed all the steps causes us to make less use of this program than we might otherwise. And as mentioned there is no patents with segwit.

Even greg maxwell has talked about them,  so who is saying they don't exist? ;3;1;False;BCosbyDidNothinWrong;dh0ipc4;Blockstream having patents in Segwit makes all the weird pieces of the last three years fall perfectly into place;https://falkvinge.net/2017/05/01/blockstream-patents-segwit-makes-pieces-fall-place/
"It appears the scenario might be that Blockstream makes money by keeping the $ being used in the middle east and when you go to the grocery store.

"The only topic I was aware of among those is the last one. Calling nullc a liar because it is ""very unlikely"" he reverse engineered the chip is hardly any proof for lying. He was right and he figured it out somehow, and he never said he operated the (hypothetical) electron microscope himself.

Reading up on the others... even Ver is just complaining about not having gotten an apology, also adam gave good reason for having had the wrong info in the first place and corrected his statement, removing what turned out to be wrong and admitting to it.

Then there is the one where nullc supposedly said First Response wrote this Craig piece, but I read all of the linked info but could not find nullc claiming this. Please tell me where he does, because if he didn't claim that, proofing that they didn't write it is not contradicting him. I stumbled across https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4p2b8k/reminder_of_bitcoin_developer_greg_maxwell_aka/d69teui/ while reading up, and see nullc putting his bitcoin with his mouth. Looks like all those being too sure didn't take the offer on 50:1.

So we are down to adam saying Ver pays ViaBTC. I have very little insight here, might be true (adam claims so), might be a lie (ViaBTC claims so), hard to proof eithe way. Little sticking after so much slinging.
