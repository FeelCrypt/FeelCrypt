More importantly crypto faith is already high and many people are already looking at other crypto for the currency case as opposed to store of value.

Stop straw manning libertarianism as a whole.  There are [11 different types of liberterians](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dx4wWGTttFI) and most are not as radical as everyone parrots.  Also even the most extreme libertarians would opt for a slow transition away from gov control.  Austin Peterson, the lead libertarian candidate, has called for a 1% across the board cut if elected.

"> It reduces people's ability to run full nodes. Full nodes need to download, verify and rebroadcast each block as it is confirmed, so increasing the blocksize increases the data they have to download and upload.

It seems to me that what drives the requirements is total amount of transactions submitted, not block size.  Nodes have to send and receive the transactions anyway, *and* they have to validate them before sending them.  This work is independent of block size; after all, smaller blocksizes simply integrate the transactions out over more blocks.

Furthermore, afaik, there is work in progress to reduce block transmission i/o because nodes generally already have the transaction data.  So again, it seems as though the total number of transactions submitted is what primarily drives the bandwidth, compute, and RAM requirements of full-nodes, not blocksize.

If my analysis is wrong, I'd certainly like to be corrected; I'm trying to look up some hard data about how much work and bandwidth are used by node transaction vs block data, but haven't yet found anything conclusive.";1;1;False;primitive_screwhead;drb7ljf;Type of memes that need to be r/bitcoin;7jzd30;https://i.redd.it/ntyz2w7iw2401.png

"It's not about miner fee nor miner work. There are systemic consequences that Core developers don't like.

It reduces people's ability to run full nodes. Full nodes need to download, verify and rebroadcast each block as it is confirmed, so increasing the blocksize increases the data they have to download and upload. A lot of people already can't run good full nodes because of monthly bandwidth limits.

This has several implications

1- Full nodes are more resistant to a majority miner attack on the network than lightweight SPV wallets (like the one you probably use) because SPV wallets verify and download very little data so they don't know if the blockchain they are following is valid, they just blindly follow whatever blockchain has the most proof of work (miner support). The counterpoint here is that miners have incentives to not hurt the network and it would require a lot of miners to be able to perform such a majority attack, so people dismiss the risk.

2- Full nodes are also necessary for the lightning network to successfully work. If running a full node is very cheap we could have tons of LN routing nodes and that would allow a decentralized effective LN. LN is supposed to allow instant, near-0 fee transactions.

No one can single-handedly update the blocksize on our network. It would require a near unanimous consensus of all users for this to happen without a hard fork (the network splitting into 2 blockchains). 

On the other hand, anyone can update the blocksize by doing a hardfork, which has already happened and is called Bitcoin Cash. If you want to support that hardfork you can move part of your assets there. If a strong majority of users moves to bitcoin cash that will in all practic terms become bitcoin.

"Oh, you mean these guys?

[Digital Currency Group](http://dcg.co/who-we-are/) owns (in part) and directs [Blockstream](http://dcg.co/portfolio/) (go to ""B"" and look 13 down). Guess who runs Digital Currency Group:
 
1. Glenn Hutchins: Former Advisor to President Clinton. Hutchins sits on the board of **The Federal Reserve Bank of New York**, where he was reelected as a Class B director for a three-year term ending December 31, 2018.
 
2. Barry Silbert: CEO of Digital Currency Group, (**funded by Mastercard**) who is also an Ex investment Banker at Houlihan Lokey. This is the guy who thought SW2x was a good idea.
 
3. Lawrence H. Summers: ""Board Advisor""
""**Chief Economist at the World Bank from 1991 to 1993**. In 1993, Summers was appointed **Undersecretary for International Affairs of the United States Department of the Treasury under the Clinton Administration**. In 1995, he was promoted to **Deputy Secretary of the Treasury** under his long-time political mentor Robert Rubin. In 1999, he succeeded Rubin as **Secretary of the Treasury**. While working for the Clinton administration Summers played a leading role in the American response to the 1994 economic crisis in Mexico, the 1997 Asian financial crisis, and the Russian financial crisis. He was also **influential in the American advised privatization of the economies of the post-Soviet states [a massive FUD campaign that caused Russian citizens to sell their shares in public companies - these shares were purchased by Oligarch bankers with ties to Western Banks and most Russian people had their national resources stolen from them]**, and in the **deregulation of the U.S financial system, including the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act**.""
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Summers
 
4. Blythe Masters: ""Former executive at JPMorgan Chase.[1] She is currently the CEO of Digital Asset Holdings,[2] a financial technology firm developing distributed ledger technology for wholesale financial services.[3] Masters is **widely credited as the creator of the credit default swap as a financial instrument**. She is also Chairman of the Governing Board of the Linux Foundation’s open source Hyperledger Project, member of the **International Advisory Board of Santander Group**, and **Advisory Board Member of the US Chamber of Digital Commerce**.""
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blythe_Masters
 
DCG is also an investor in BitGo (See ""How it works""). See also: Money map
BitGo aims to become a ""service"" which prevents double spending. I thought Bitcoin had that built in. Well this service is only useful if transactions aren't being confirmed in the blockchain (rather, confirmed in, say, a side-chain, like Lightning--Blockstream's developing technology). Surprise, surprise. SegWit2x would literally take power out of the hands of the miners and gives it to central bankers and MasterCard. Interesting that after the decision to ""suspend"" (does not mean cancel) SegWit2x, Bitcoin gets held hostage by ridiculous transaction times.
 
edit: also worth watching this video from MasterCard before they invested in DCG. Notice this guy is just reading a damn script, too. Smh. Probably doesn't even know what he's saying.

It also shows that fees continue to rise as well, since new colors bands appear on occasion.

"No, what I am saying is that transactions over $1.00 can be easily handled on chain, and that transactions under $1.00 can be handled with simple protocols involving no complicated smart transactions, just small scale trusted aggregators.  There is to little at risk to justify complex klugery, such as LN for these cases.  Now it may be the case that I've drawn the line too high, and people might want a ""trustless"" system for transactions in a narrow range, e.g. less than $1.00 but more than $0.10.

"A valid test (but only one such sample) would involve two separate purported test users, one who is a merchant who creates an invoice and one who as a consumer who pays the invoice.  Unless you, personally have done both parts of the transaction you know nothing about whether the system worked (for you).  This is equivalent to the early tests many of us made with Bitcoin where we had two wallets and we sent funds from one to the other.

Of course, such tests won't show whether the system works at scale, nor will they show whether the system can be trusted to hold your funds.  But they are the minimal tests needed to see of a system, whether BTC or LN, is even functional.

Were you were to do this with BTC you would discover that your funds would get transferred, even  if the ""merchant"" and the ""consumer"" were not on line simultaneously.  (Again, this is one of the tests I made back in the early days.)  If you were to do this with LN you would discover that the system did not work.  (Here you would have to deliberately ensure that your test consumer and your test merchant were not both on-line simultaneously, otherwise you might get a false ""success"" for an ultimately unviable system.)

Or you could just take many days figuring out the LN white paper and conclude that the system is way too complex to every possibly work in the real world, even if the people designing it happened to be true geniuses.

"> My biggest concern about Bitcoin Cash is this: there are tons of altcoins out there, most of them have some selling points, they can do certain things a lot better than what Bitcoin can. Rather than creating yet another altcoin (it does not have the network effect, it does not have the market cap, it does not have the most proof of work - hence it cannot be something better than an altcoin), why not promote one of the best altcoins as ""Bitcoin 2.0""?

Because it's Bitcoin.  It's the original.  Just because a software+network fork happened, doesn't mean it doesn't still have the same history and original utility that Bitcoin had.  Bitcoin will always be the first, and the only way to save it, if you will, was to fork it.

Me personally, I moved to something else, but I understand why people would want to keep Bitcoin alive.  Hell, I hope Bitcoin Cash takes over and can eventually have the name back.

"What that means is that either side can screw you out of the fees you spent funding the channel and the fees that you pay when your ""honest"" counter-party closes the channel.  Quite apart from opportunity costs and the ""time value of money"" it is clear that opening a channel to a sketchy partner is not going to be risk free.  This is such a significant factor with BTC fees that it precludes any rational person opening a LN channel to an anonymous hub.  As a result, some system of authentication of hubs will be required or will have to evolve.  And any system of authentication is inherently centralized, because there is a central authority that authenticates the players.  And once this has been done, then the next step is government monitoring and regulation.

For this reason, there is no chance a decentralized LN will work to solve any real-world scaling problem.  

The unique aspect of Bitcoin is that it does not require any authentication of the nodes or any of the users.  This, and only this, is what makes Bitcoin decentralized.  This comes at a price which is two fold:  energy has to be burnt to perform proof of work and nodes need to do work to validate all of the transactions.  Any design in which some nodes validate some transactions (LN is just one of many such) will require a way of ensuring that the players are segregated and doing their job, namely validating the transactions they are responsible for validating.  This will inevitably involve a system of authentication, such as a reputation system. Any such system requires a central authority who authenticates the players, otherwise the system will be subject to Sybil attacks.

I've eliminated a lot of arcane technical details which people who understand the difference between Leslie Lamport's solution to the Byzantine General's problem and Satoshi Nakamoto's solution of a related, but harder problem, the anonymous Byzantine General's problem, will appreciate.

"Its all about motive.

What motive does blockstream have to strangle bitcoin?

Profit (side chain efforts) or divide and conquer: banks run Blockstream, banks want control in crypto.  This whole big block vs small block civil war has been orchestrated by the banks.

Is Roger Ver a Bank?  No, but blockstream is owned by one:

Digital Currency Group owns (in part) and directs Blockstream (go to ""B"" and look 13 down). Guess who runs Digital Currency Group:

Glenn Hutchins: Former Advisor to President Clinton. Hutchins sits on the board of The Federal Reserve Bank of New York, where he was reelected as a Class B director for a three-year term ending December 31, 2018.

Barry Silbert: CEO of Digital Currency Group, (funded by Mastercard) who is also an Ex investment Banker at Houlihan Lokey. This is the guy who thought SW2x was a good idea.

Lawrence H. Summers: ""Board Advisor"" ""Chief Economist at the World Bank from 1991 to 1993. In 1993, Summers was appointed Undersecretary for International Affairs of the United States Department of the Treasury under the Clinton Administration. In 1995, he was promoted to Deputy Secretary of the Treasury under his long-time political mentor Robert Rubin. In 1999, he succeeded Rubin as Secretary of the Treasury. While working for the Clinton administration Summers played a leading role in the American response to the 1994 economic crisis in Mexico, the 1997 Asian financial crisis, and the Russian financial crisis. He was also influential in the American advised privatization of the economies of the post-Soviet states [a massive FUD campaign that caused Russian citizens to sell their shares in public companies - these shares were purchased by Oligarch bankers with ties to Western Banks and most Russian people had their national resources stolen from them], and in the deregulation of the U.S financial system, including the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act."" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Summers

Blythe Masters: ""Former executive at JPMorgan Chase.[1] She is currently the CEO of Digital Asset Holdings,[2] a financial technology firm developing distributed ledger technology for wholesale financial services.[3] Masters is widely credited as the creator of the credit default swap as a financial instrument. She is also Chairman of the Governing Board of the Linux Foundation’s open source Hyperledger Project, member of the International Advisory Board of Santander Group, and Advisory Board Member of the US Chamber of Digital Commerce."" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blythe_Masters

DCG is also an investor in BitGo (See ""How it works""). See also: Money map BitGo aims to become a ""service"" which prevents double spending. I thought Bitcoin had that built in. Well this service is only useful if transactions aren't being confirmed in the blockchain (rather, confirmed in, say, a side-chain, like Lightning--Blockstream's developing technology). Surprise, surprise. SegWit2x would literally take power out of the hands of the miners and gives it to central bankers and MasterCard. Interesting that after the decision to ""suspend"" (does not mean cancel) SegWit2x, Bitcoin gets held hostage by ridiculous transaction times.

edit: also worth watching this video from MasterCard before they invested in DCG. Notice this guy is just reading a damn script, too. Smh. Probably doesn't even know what he's saying.

"> No, what I am saying is that transactions over $1.00 can be easily handled on chain, and that transactions under $1.00 can be handled with simple protocols involving no complicated smart transactions, just small scale trusted aggregators. There is to little at risk to justify complex klugery, such as LN for these cases. Now it may be the case that I've drawn the line too high, and people might want a ""trustless"" system for transactions in a narrow range, e.g. less than $1.00 but more than $0.10. Perhaps there is a market for a LN network in this region, but this is hardly significant and certainly no excuse to sabotage on-chain scaling to force people into LN type solutions.

I can't send a transaction today without paying $10-$20 in fees. Good luck arguing a use case for sending $1 for $21.

[Regarding what makes bitcoin decentralized](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin_Facts/comments/7dp5cn/point_2_decentralization_what_is_it_why_we_have/)


>Decentralization is one of Bitcoin's main selling points. But what does it actually mean? Skip to the end for the tl;dr

**What is centralization**    
As we all know from reading everything Satoshi wrote about his design for Bitcoin from satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org, Bitcoin was finalized and born in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. In this event many normal people lost money while banking executives made more and more. 

**Where does centralization come from**       
These banks, much like the bank you probably use today, are centralized. That is, they alone control everything that happens. There is one database which has everyone's funds, if they decide you are a terrorist or something they can stop you from access your money. They can stop you from making transactions. Even if you have done nothing wrong they can stop payment on your transactions without your consent, lock you out of your funds, and monitor everything you do. 


**What  is decentralization**       
By splitting up the 'power' that a bank has we decentralize it. There is no longer any one single entity that can control txs and funds. This way no one is 'in charge' and no one can give themselves bonuses while other people lose money. This decentralization is a founding point of Bitcoin.

**Where does decentralization come from**       
Instead of one company controlling the database of funds like in the centralized model, in Bitcoin's decentralized model there are many people who can all contribute to the database and transaction processing without any one entity having full control. In Bitcoin and other POW based cryptocurrencies this decentralization is achieved by having a number of *mining nodes* who are not affiliated. As long as no group of miners controls more than 51% of the hashpower, bitcoin remains decentralized.

---


**So only mining nodes contribute to decentralization, then what about non-mining nodes**      
Non-mining nodes, full nodes, relay nodes, or storage nodes are often misunderstood to be part of decentralization. This can be easily cleared up by understanding the above information and then understanding that a non-mining node has no *power* if the majority of hashpower were to do something they didn't like. 

**I thought everyone was supposed to run a full node**      
This is another common misunderstanding, in the very beginning Satoshi did intend for everyone to run a node with 4 functions. He is very clear when he explains how this is not the way for the system to function in the future. The plan of bitcoin is that everyone can make trustless peer-to-peer transactions on a decentralized system. Not that everyone would run a home server with the whole blockchain. The business and bitcoin companies that need to have personal and instant validation of their tx can run a full nodes. Random sampling is a tried and trusted method, those unable to host their own relay node would be easily able to verify their transactions with overwhelming mathematically certainty.

**So who wants to run a full node then**     
Anyone who wants to can, it's like the Olympics, 'anyone can compete but few feel the need to'. There is no reason the network should be ground to a halt and made useless so people who can't afford to make a transaction would be able to run a full node on a 20 year old computer over a dial up connection. Bitcoin was meant to scale with technology, not become left behind. 


**What are the 4 functions that all early nodes did**       
When you read the design of Bitcoin which we all invested into, the design on which so much was built, the one at nakamotoinstitute.org, you see Satoshi mention the word 'node' many times. What we today call a full node or non-mining node usually fulfills one of those functions, that of storing the database. Finding other peers for connecting to is done by full nodes and pool operators. Sending and receiving bitcoin, aka a wallet, was also a function every node had. Finally generating coins by putting new transactions into the blockchain was the 4th thing all nodes used to do. Today these 4 actions are largely compartmentalized, as they should be in any good computer science project.

This is Bitcoin, some people are unhappy with the way Bitcoin was designed, well I suppose Bitcoin is simply not for those people and they should maybe find something else to do.


I hope you've all learned something today about how Bitcoin is decentralized, what is means, and how we got there.

tl;dr Banks control all txs and accounts with one database and are centralized, Bitcoin has many miners who perform this actions to make it decentralized. Non-mining nodes don't contribute to decentralization.

"Not only do you have to lock up funds, but the merchant does, too.  Hoping for a payment in this new payment method.  And every hub between you and the merchant have to also lock up funds.

If you want to fund a $25 payment channel to a merchant, you and your LN hub (Hub-A) both commit $25 to open the channel.  If your Hub-A does not already have a relationship with the merchant, Hub-A has to open a $25 payment channel (both sides committing funds) to merchant's hub (Hub-B).  And the merchant must also have committed funds to Hub-B of at least $25.  There can be many additional hubs... but this is the simplest (ha) way LN will work.

*Everyone* has funds tied up that they can't use for other purposes.  There is a time limit on the channel, and even if you need immediate access to your unused funds, it can take at least a day for your hub to agree to close the channel with an on-chain transaction.

And, each hub will charge a fee along your path, since they had to commit funds for your benefit.  Efficiency at it's worst.

When you swipe a card it does not touch VISAs database directly. The only thing different is it takes significant effort to become a payment gateway provider. With lightning network almost anyone with little technical knowledge can run a lightning node and get paid in very small amounts (less than a penny) which adds up to a lot when you allow thousands to millions of transactions to process thru your node.

"The largest 100 mining pools could (if they switched to BCH) could be running Visa scale transaction rates in a few months.  The present software handles perhaps 1000 transactions per second and there are various simple tweaks that can speed this up.  My six year old desktop computer that cost me $600 can already handle 1000 transaction per second.   Of course there is no chance the transaction rates will grow this quickly, so there will be much more time to solve any programming glitches that arrive.  There are multiple teams developing BCH software and if one of them gets mired down in politics they will be simply bypassed.

Bitcoin scaling is a **very** simple problem to solve.  It's actually easier to solve than the scaling that Visa has done, due to the extreme simplicity and robustness of the design.  However, scaling Rube Goldberg designs such as LN are another matter, entirely.

"They whole LN network topology is not stored.  What's in the block chain is a set of historical payment channels.  From this data one can deduce what payments might possibly work in the future, providing nothing changes.  However, there are three types of changes that can happen.  Nodes can decide to shut down (e.g. hubs closing many channels),  nodes can go crash or go on temporary holiday (power failure, DDoS, natural disaster) or nodes can  exhaust the limit of funds in the channel.

The first two problems are typical of Internet routing problems and are very difficult to solve at scale in a distributed fashion.  Ultimately, Internet routing is not distributed, but is controlled by centralized authorities who assign blocks of IP addressess and autonomous system numbers.

The problem with LN is much more difficult, because not only is it subject to changes that make Internet routing difficult, but it also depends on traffic flows. Because funds are committed to channels, this becomes a multi-commodity problem.  This is a much more complicated problem than simply solving the routing problem that the internet solved.  And it should be noted that internet only solved this problem by punting the congestion control problem.  The internet only works because there is a certain amount of excess bandwidth.

And similarly, with the LN network.  The LN network can be made to route if the channels are funded with huge amounts and provide reserve capacity for most transactions.  This may work for microtransactions, but for normal size transactions this will involve tying up huge amounts of value (Bitcoins).  Unfortunately, capital is finite and expensive and not cheap.  There is no Moore's law applying here.  In fact, the entire concept behind LN is flawed.  It is based on the idea of tying up value (Bitcoins) to save transactions (computer cycles and bandwidth).  This has been done without doing the math so see if there is any possibility of a net saving whatsoever.  It is so incredibly cheap to process a Bitcoin transaction that tying up any amount of funds and putting them at risk of being hacked seems like a fool's errand.  If there were a case to be made that my (and u/jstolfi 's) intuition is wrong, then the LN promoters would have come up with hard numbers to show that LN represents a good tradeoff.

"Trying to use a financial system a few times and seeing that you weren't secured is not any kind of indication that the system ""works"".  The essence of financial systems is that they tell some people ""yes"" and other people ""no"" according to how many ""beans"" these people have.  And if there are only a few ""beans"" at play then a skilled hacker who has figured out how to hack the system would sit tight.  He would wait until there were enough beans to ensure his safe retirement, or, at very least, had enough money to buy a Lambo.  

Have you made LN transactions where your life would have changed if they were all gone?  If not, then your experience is irrelevant.

There are so many ways in which the LN would fail this test except for pocket change that it's hardly worth mentioning.  The simplest example is that all of your funds that are tied up in a LN channel have to be in a hot wallet.  So even if all of the Bitcoin and LN software and the very complex LN protocol are perfect you will still be at risk if the computer you are using is not 100% trustworthy.

In other words, LN will work fine with pocket change and provide some scaling benefit if channels are loaded with a few pockets worth of change.  To be used for anything else is highly questionable.  But the amount of money put into channels is critical to the amount of ""scaling"" that LN provides.  Unless many times the typical Bitcoin payment are put into a LN channel the there will be minimal ""scaling"" benefits of LN to Bitcoin.

"A modern 1 core of a CPU processes 100,000 sigops per second (doing ECDSA operations, primarily, the hashing takes minimal effort.)  With a typical Bitcoin transaction being 2 input and 2 outputs, this means that this core can process 50,000 transactions per second.  Other cores can be employed to do database operations and process network communications.  These are not a serious problem.  The net result of all of the above is that a modern computer can process a million Bitcoin transactions for a total cost of about $1 USD.  This means that a Bitcoin network of 10,000 nodes (obviously such a network is distributed) can process a Bitcoin transaction for under $0.01 USD.  These costs scale, that is to say, if there are twice as many transactions each computer will have to cost twice as much.  But it is easy to see that such a system is entirely practical, because the underlying costs are so damned low, and that is with today's technology.

So if the problem is paying for typical human payments, Bitcoin can completely scale.  It was designed to be a ""cash"" system and it works fine for payments where fees of $0.01 are considered relevant.

Transactions where the amount is under $1.00 USD can be handled by very simple systems which aggregate microtransactions and batch them.  It remains to be seen whether the complexity of systems such as LN are needed to remove the counter party risk for these transactions.  In most cases, there are other risks between the parties involved that go way beyond the financial risks, so the entire question of ""riskless"" transactions come into play here.  It is not clear that there will be any need for complex systems such as LN, which if they can be made to work will be only useful for a narrow range of transaction values, all sub one dollar.

I know that there is no leader, but they should have a PR person, a spokesman. All developers can pick and vote for one, and embassasor - I don't know. We should be needing to do research to find out about the status of LN. 99% of the users in coinbase have no idea what LN is all about. People need to know that bcash is centralized. ;0;2;False;richyboycaldo;dr9msm1;I thought Bitcoin Cash was the fraud;7jr9a2;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7jr9a2/i_thought_bitcoin_cash_was_the_fraud/
"> Transactions where the amount is under $1.00 USD can be handled by very simple systems which aggregate microtransactions and batch them. It remains to be seen whether the complexity of systems such as LN are needed to remove the counter party risk for these transactions. In most cases, there are other risks between the parties involved that go way beyond the financial risks, so the entire question of ""riskless"" transactions come into play here. It is not clear that there will be any need for complex systems such as LN, which if they can be made to work will be only useful for a narrow range of transaction values, all sub one dollar.

I saw this post second. So now you're arguing for LN?

LN is not going to work for machines any better than it would work for people in Bitcoin Core.

""why is the whitepaper so important""


People who researched Bitcoin before investing probably meant to invest in what they researched. Changing the fundamental aspects of this investment without their permission or want is unethical. 

The Bitcoin whitepaper is the specification of Bitcoin, a high level overview that should persists as relevant for all of Bitcoin's life. That's what a whitepaper is. If someone wants a system with full blocks, high fees, forced middlemen(LN), or full nodes with power, then what they want is not Bitcoin.

Let us use this simple analogy as a thought experiment to see why people feel the way they do.

*Imagine*

You read about a new steakhouse with very tasty steaks.     
You go to there, read the menu, pick out the best steak and order it.

No Imagine they bring you scrambled eggs instead. No steak. You went to the steak house, you ordered a steak, you were expecting a steak, but they brought you something else.

You complain to the waiter who tells you the cooks are experts with food and they know better than you. The cooks decided scrambled eggs would be better for you without your input or consent. 

The waiter asks why you are upset? He says he doesn't understand.         
You wanted food, they brought you food, why are you upset? The cooks are smarter than you, they know what you want better than you, you should be grateful for their input says the waiter.


This is how most Bitcoin users feel, that what they wanted (bitcoin) is not what they have (legacy bitcoin).

"> this conflict between Bitcoin philosophies is a shit solution

that's an interesting perspective.  I'm curious why you think this, and what you think could be better?

The whole point of a global, permissionless currency is that no actor can control it and confiscate it or dilute your money or censor you.

That means that ""nobody control it.""  Which also means that ""anyone can control it.""  I agree this is a paradox, but it is fundamental.  If you put someone ""in charge"" then that someone can do good or bad things.  If you remove the idea that anyone is ""in charge"" then it means that anyone can try to ""take charge"" but they can't succeed unless enough people choose to go along.

We always knew that one day The Powers That Be would try to ""jam up"" Bitcoin.  And, with only one development team (which many of us said was a mistake) it seemed very easy to jam up Bitcoin: just co-opt the team and then introduce one poison pill after another until the patient dies.  Give the poison an important-sounding name like Segwit and the patient might even eat the poison thinking its the antidote.

In this the 1MB limit turned out to be a terrible design decision - all that was needed to ""jam up"" Bitcoin was to refuse to remove it.  It's like a Tesla with a 1MPH speed limiter on it.  Who could have guessed that it would be possible to convince lots of people that keeping the 1MPH speed limiter was an *absolute necessity?*  That part is a real eye-opener when you look into how they managed that.

But here's the thing: a whole bunch of us refused to take the poison pill - Bitcoin, the original project, is alive and well and back on track after a brief delay and now called ""Bitcoin Cash.""  Everyone who was an early adopter of Bitcoin has an equal stake in Bitcoin Cash and their capital is now once again invested in the original goals of the project that they originally invested in.  

So in hindsight, in many regards, Bitcoin is working as designed.  The mechanisms known to prevent capture-and-command (an evasive hardfork) were used and they worked.  In my view that's bullish as fuck.";1;1;False;jessquit;drapysw;"Why large blocks: because one man's ""coffee purchase transaction"" is another man's monthly income";7jslzs;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7jslzs/why_large_blocks_because_one_mans_coffee_purchase/

"The point that Core supporters often seem to miss is that blocks are only as heavy as the transactions they contain.  What makes the blockchain heavier is **more transactions**.  It does not matter if those transactions are spread out over 1,000 1mb blocks or in one 1gb block.  All small blocks do is artificially slow the rate at which the blockchain's weight increases.  If that rate does not match the rate at which users are attempting to generate new transactions, the only result is the network becoming more expensive for *everybody*.

The obstacle in running a validating non-mining node, then, is not storage or processing power, because the cost of congestion to the network, paid via the fee market, could have been spent on hardware (those who use the network most heavily are also the most likely to have reason to run a validating node).  Rather, the obstacle is *maybe* bandwidth, as that is an infrastructural issue that in some places may not be accessible even with deep, deep pockets.

So OP is exactly right: block size limit is nothing more than an onboarding rate limiter.  In fact, it's worse than that, because increase in demand also raises the floor of minimum transaction value, meaning even those who managed to get onboard may find themselves unable to transact.

It's a shame.  I think the guy is brilliant.  It's beyond me why he hasn't spoken up about the abuses of core.  I saw one of his talks lately and I gather his major argument is that there is no possible way for bitcoin to scale enough.  He foresees a lot of what I consider silly uses for the blockchain.  Like all those micropayments, 5 cents here and 5 cents there for reading articles online.  I don't see it catching on and if it did there's a proper use case for a side chain.  He's talked about an average household having 50 connected devices where even a lightbulb is online using up blockchain resources or being charged incrementally as you go on that uber ride.  I don't envision that there would be a need for or a demand for these kinds of technologies down the road.  I have no interest in ever being so connected.  So in my little world at least Bitcoin does scale now and into the future.

"i didnt want to turn this into a bch vs btc thing and really hate having to take the opposite side of these discussion in this sub reddit. but sw - sw address is cheap and fast. BCH txs are cheap but not necessary fast. you can look at the varying block times of 15-35 minutes for this by view the last 400 blocks in any blockchain explorer ETH tx get stupid slow depending on how many icos or user of cryptokitties happen to be on. (note your tx vs a smart contract are executed differently depending on the contracts minimum gas requirements.) based on the actual contents of the txs of the last 50 blocks on https://etherscan.io/

as far as centralization goes in my opinion block size has nothing to do with it and that participant miners have everything to do with it. i look at how many committed miners there are and their locations and scratch my head at how its not considered centralized based on https://cash.coin.dance/blocks which shows 1/4 mined by roger's companies , 1/4 mined by Jihan Wu infrastructure and a single unidentified miner clearing 54% of all txs.

This is what never made sense to me. Why would that ever take off? Visa/Mastercard already works well. If you end up with another state controlled currency, you didn't solve much.

The promise of cryptos is that there's no central entity that can control it. If bitcoin can't do that, it would simply fail and another coin will take over.

"I hear a lot of folks, especially at r/bitcoin chastizing this or that transaction because someone didn't clip coupons or eat during the business lunch special.

I sent from a Coinomi wallet to an exchange and the suggested tx was $34.  I cut it to $8 and it still took over 4 hours.  Meanwhile, my BCH transaction was good in about 15 minutes and it was free.  It was my 4th FREE BCH transaction in a row.  I don't mean .03 cents free, I mean 0.0 cents nothing free.

More than 90% of BTC's rise in the last 2 months is NEW MONEY.  They new money doesn't know where to clip coupons.  They will pay the $34 fee.
