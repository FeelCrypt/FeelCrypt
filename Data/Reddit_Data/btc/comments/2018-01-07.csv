"They had banking problems since at least for the last 3 years and their last known bank account was shut down in May. Since then, they switched completely to Tethers from USD, but they seem to deliberately confuse their users because their account balances appear in USD on the site, even though it's in USDT. The company that issues Tethers is owned by the same guy who owns Bitfinex and can issue Tethers on a whim. 1 year ago there were $10 million Tethers, today there are $1.5 billion (in Dec alone they issued over $500 million USDT). They claim Tethers are backed by USD 1-to-1 so in theory they have $1.5 billion dollars somewhere, but they refuse to provide any evidence. They don't even say in what jurisdiction the company is registered in. /r/bitfinex is full of people who complain that they can't move their money at all since late October, and customer support seems to be non-existent.

Cashouts have been stopped. They closed account creation and stopped doing business with US customers (presumably because of the SEC is started to look into exchanges since August). They updated the [Tether ToS](https://tether.to/legal/) and now it literally says that their customers have no right to sue them if they scam them, which is completely ridiculous.

Basically everything they've done in the last 6 months just raised ever bigger red flags, the ToS update 3 days ago is the icing on the cake.

If you do not trust the government or the banks you need to fix those entities. Side channeling a vapor currency is not going to accomplish anything. 

As for gold. 

Well commodity currencies inherently limit the growth of an economy the moment scarcity exceeds the economies needs. If more gold can't be found when the economy needs it the economy turns downwards until it finds more gold. 

This leads to merchantilism and gold and silver wars as well as restrictive trade deals where each country has to keep a tight lid on the amount of gold they have in the system. Otherwise their economy runs out and they see negative effects. 

A decentralized crypto currency that supplants government currency results in an economy which is holey dependant on its supply of crypto which it cannot control.

If you don't mind going through an off-chain centralized payment processor then why not use something like BitGold instead?

Gold mining is a lot less centralized than bitcoin mining, and you're not reliant on the continued co-operation of gold miners for it to stay valuable.

At least that legally entitles you to physical gold which would still be useful even if the entire gold market collapsed.

None of them are going to work long term, but raising blocksize works better in the short term than not doing so. Lightning can be made to work for BCH as well as BTC, so it confers no unique advantage to BTC. It's still going to cost more to open a channel in BTC.

No, because each channel only needs two on-chain transactions, the opening and the close.

"The best estimate we have on the network topology of LN are from the LN testnet. [Here](https://medium.com/@murchandamus/a-look-at-an-early-ln-testnet-topology-a874a6ff41d9) is a blogpost where you can see visualization of the LN testnet with commentary. In my opinion this network is not at all becoming the pure ""hub and spoke"" that many have been claiming it would become.

Most importantly, LN will not introduce counterparty risk and it will not affect the decentralization of the base layer.

What sort of impact LN will have on on-chain fees is very hard to tell. Some people claim with certainty that it will solve all problems and others claim it won't have any effect. I think both are ignorant. It's obviously not going to be a ""quick fix"" that alleviates everything from day one but it will (regardless of impact on on-chain fees) create a lot of utility for Bitcoin as it allows cheap, trustless off-chain transactions after opening a channel or two. 

This utility (and usage of the LN) obviously only comes as it is adopted. This could happen depressingly slow (as with SW) or a lot faster. What it has going for it, that SegWit doesn't, is that it doesn't matter what other people do. If 10% uses SW, the effect on the mempool is minimal and thus fees stay high even for the ones using it (although of a bit lower for them). With LN, the users aren't affected in any way by the non-users, incentive for businesses that are doing low-value transactions to adopt it will be huge. Especially early on, as I'm sure there will be many more users wanting to use it than businesses accepting it.

Regardless of your scaling preferences I think you should be excited by these innovations even if you think they have been used as an excuse for doing what you would have preffered (raising the base block size on Bitcoin).";5;3;False;YoungScholar89;dsbkhtf;The idiocracy of r/bitcoin;7opi7w;https://i.imgur.com/I2Rt4fQ.gifv

"Decentralization is one of Bitcoin's main selling points. But what does it actually mean? Skip to the end for the tl;dr

**What is centralization**    
As we all know from reading everything Satoshi wrote about his design for Bitcoin from satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org, Bitcoin was finalized and born in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. In this event many normal people lost money while banking executives made more and more. 

**Where does centralization come from**       
These banks, much like the bank you probably use today, are centralized. That is, they alone control everything that happens. There is one database which has everyone's funds, if they decide you are a terrorist or something they can stop you from access your money. They can stop you from making transactions. Even if you have done nothing wrong they can stop payment on your transactions without your consent, lock you out of your funds, and monitor everything you do. 


**What  is decentralization**       
By splitting up the 'power' that a bank has we decentralize it. There is no longer any one single entity that can control txs and funds. This way no one is 'in charge' and no one can give themselves bonuses while other people lose money. This decentralization is a founding point of Bitcoin.

**Where does decentralization come from**       
Instead of one company controlling the database of funds like in the centralized model, in Bitcoin's decentralized model there are many people who can all contribute to the database and transaction processing without any one entity having full control. In Bitcoin and other POW based cryptocurrencies this decentralization is achieved by having a number of *mining nodes* who are not affiliated. As long as no group of miners controls more than 51% of the hashpower, bitcoin remains decentralized.

---


**So only mining nodes contribute to decentralization, then what about non-mining nodes**      
Non-mining nodes, full nodes, relay nodes, or storage nodes are often misunderstood to be part of decentralization. This can be easily cleared up by understanding the above information and then understanding that a non-mining node has no *power* if the majority of hashpower were to do something they didn't like. 

**I thought everyone was supposed to run a full node**      
This is another common misunderstanding, in the very beginning Satoshi did intend for everyone to run a node with 4 functions. He is very clear when he explains how this is not the way for the system to function in the future. The plan of bitcoin is that everyone can make trustless peer-to-peer transactions on a decentralized system. Not that everyone would run a home server with the whole blockchain. The business and bitcoin companies that need to have personal and instant validation of their tx can run a full nodes. Random sampling is a tried and trusted method, those unable to host their own relay node would be easily able to verify their transactions with overwhelming mathematically certainty.

**So who wants to run a full node then**     
Anyone who wants to can, it's like the Olympics, 'anyone can compete but few feel the need to'. There is no reason the network should be ground to a halt and made useless so people who can't afford to make a transaction would be able to run a full node on a 20 year old computer over a dial up connection. Bitcoin was meant to scale with technology, not become left behind. 


**What are the 4 functions that all early nodes did**       
When you read the design of Bitcoin which we all invested into, the design on which so much was built, the one at nakamotoinstitute.org, you see Satoshi mention the word 'node' many times. What we today call a full node or non-mining node usually fulfills one of those functions, that of storing the database. Finding other peers for connecting to is done by full nodes and pool operators. Sending and receiving bitcoin, aka a wallet, was also a function every node had. Finally generating coins by putting new transactions into the blockchain was the 4th thing all nodes used to do. Today these 4 actions are largely compartmentalized, as they should be in any good computer science project.

---


This is Bitcoin, some people are unhappy with the way Bitcoin was designed, well I suppose Bitcoin is simply not for those people and they should maybe find something else to do.


I hope you've all learned something today about how Bitcoin is decentralized, what is means, and how we got there.

tl;dr Banks control all txs and accounts with one database and are centralized, Bitcoin has many miners who perform this actions to make it decentralized.

I run a full node on a crappy cable connection. I just reduced the number of nodes connectable (bitcoind connects to way too many nodes by default in my opinion (especially for non-mining nodes) and this makes inefficient use of bandwidth and also makes you more vulnerable to certain forms of attack) and I also throttled the connection (using tc.sh) since bitcoin traffic is very bursty which is not good if you are using the connection for other things.;1;0;False;Richy_T;dsbq8k3;The idiocracy of r/bitcoin;7opi7w;https://i.imgur.com/I2Rt4fQ.gifv

"The problem is as I outlined. 

If you can manipulate the scarcity of a currency outside of a perfect algorithm then that means it is a centralized currency held by a private entity. 

And yes. Not everyone who hates banks and governments is an edge lord just like not every atheist is one. 

The key is you can hate government and banking without throwing logic out the window and assuming that any measure that excludes those entities is vastly preferable. 

People forget that banks are private entities who work in a close relation to the government because of the past transgressions of banks and private currencies that cause the government's to have an active compulsion to protect the people from private money changers. 

The government in theory is our most accountable and least private entity we can put in charge of handling money supply for the good of a nation. This is a system that was adopted after numerous countries citizens grew tired of private individuals screwing over the economy of a nation. 

Thousands of years of study, governance, finance etc have lead us to where we are. It is a result of attempting to find the most safe and suitable system for money's we can. Crypto fundamentally rolls back this advancement to before the colonial era because people who don't understand the history or function of government don't like their current government and want to destroy it. 

That's pretty edgelordy.

The way I see it: People have time preferences that do not match what Bitcoin is able to provide. The easiest answer is for individuals to reduce volume of trading by going to a secondary altcoin, which they would do naturally if nothing else changed, and honestly nothing should be changed to a crypto other than security fixes if there wasn't already a plan at the beginning to implement growth adjustments, because when you start tinkering beyond a blueprint you tend to get situations where factions form. 

We have two versions of bitcoin diverging from one another. Bad management of BTC, deviating from the design, is what I believe caused this to happen. BCH developers may be considering taking liberties to correct for issues, but this is the sort of thing you need tons of foresight to deal with succinctly in order to maintain the integrity of the money property of a crypto so that it behaves in a way that one can rely on. If that's not your goal as a developer then you're in it for the wrong reasons.

"There is nothing wrong with that. Supply and demand isn't a very easy concept to understand.

Remember that my main point is to object to misrepresentation and argument from incredulity... the idea that because one cannot understand a thing necessarily makes that thing invalid.

Higher fees incentivize people to mine, which provides a larger supply of transaction processing. Higher fees also discourages people from using the currency, for obvious reasons. Thus, if the fees are too large no one makes any transactions -- if the fees are too small no one confirms any transactions.

The most efficient balance between the two depends on the conditions of the market, but it is a balance of supply and demand.

What would happen if core set the block size *too* small? Transaction fees would rise *too* high, and *too few* people would use the system for it to be sustainable. What would happen if core set the block size *too* large? Transaction fees would fall *too* low, and there would be *too* unprofitable for anyone to mine for the system to be sustainable.

I agree completely... but *some* of these new users will run nodes.  Not many, sure, but some.  And again, it's the absolute numbers that count.  More users doesn't put any additional strain on the network (assuming full blocks), so any additional nodes by new users is a plus.  The question is whether the big jump in hardware resources will kill off enough nodes that *all future new users* won't offset that difference.  And to me, it seems obvious that that will almost certainly not be the case.  Some small percentage of users will, and it will almost certainly be enough to offset those who stopped running them solely because of the increased burden.;1;0;False;exmachinalibertas;dsc1vl8;The idiocracy of r/bitcoin;7opi7w;https://i.imgur.com/I2Rt4fQ.gifv

Yes, similarly the market will decide whether the ability for normal people being able to fully validate the network is important or not. And it is up for the people running nodes to decide what they accept as being Bitcoin.

>Even Satoshi said that himself when talking about the blockchain.

Satoshi said a lot of stuff, you seem to only care about the stuff that compliments your narrative. Regardless, I think Satoshi himself would agree that we should not blindly follow his words regardless of new information. Becoming dogmatic about the whitepaper and constantly reffering to Satoshi as some divine authority is in my opinion not very unscientific and not necesarilly the best long-term approach to scaling the network.

"Its pretty simple. 

Decentralization is a stupid goal for a functional currency. 

Its a goal pursued by edgelords that ""don't trust the government"" the way they ""are to smart to believe in fancy men in the sky"". 

To have a currency you must trust its controller. Your choices are:

* An elected body of officials who are accountable to a society provided that society is diligent enough to actually care. 

* An unelected private for profit entity with the power to manipulate currency. 

* An unelected nonprofit company with power to manipulate currency.

* A computer algorithm which cannot be changed to adjust to market changes or time. 

Two of these options create an open incentive for corruption and manipulation with little to no repurcussions. 

One of them simply cannot prevent itself from stifling the currencies economy unless you think we have solved economics down to the price of tea in 2342.

All of which have been tried and tested and over and over again one prevailed. A centralized, non private currency managed by the government. 

Bitcoin isn't new. It's digital gold. There is a reason we left gold as a currency. In fact there are tons of reasons we did. We've had private currencies and they were gotten rid of in favour of currencies that couldn't be manipulated by private entities for profit. We've had commodity currencies and they create merchantilism, war, and put a hard cap on economic transactions when scarcity becomes an issue. 

Bitcoin is a meme stock in a digital version of a dinosaur currency fueled entirely by high risk speculators and anti bank edgelords.

That being said. The technology has some interesting implications. Crypto can work. And might in the future be how digital currency exists entirely. But not in its current form. ";1;1;False;shadovvvvalker;dsbul7u;The idiocracy of r/bitcoin;7opi7w;https://i.imgur.com/I2Rt4fQ.gifv

1. You have to pay fees for every hop in the network, so the plan is to create Lightning ""hubs"" that everyone connects to. Hubs located in the US and other regulatory countries will need to abide by regulatory law. If the government decides to shut down Bitcoin some day, it will be as easy as forcing a handful of US companies to shut down their hubs. 

2. You need an always online computer with your private keys to maintain a channel. If you want to move your funds into cold storage, or even if you go on vacation for too long, you have to pay more on-chain fees to re-establish the channel. 

3. **No one will use it, even if it's perfect.** Segwit relied on end users upgrading if they wanted a 40% discount on fees. But it's 2018 now and only 8% of active transactions are from Segwit addresses. Miner nodes, which often run the same client and abide by the rules of a handful of mining pools, are easier to upgrade.  >90% of miners were prepared to upgrade to Segwit2x before the FUD campaign brought those numbers down. Even at it's lowest point, 70% of miners were committed to an upgrade. Even developers of Lightning are saying it will take 1–2 years for a significant number of users to actually use LN, and they have no other plans to scale the network in the meantime. 

EDIT: whaddayaknow, the Segwit percentage went down since the last time I checked. Changed 10% to 8%, per http://segwit.party/charts/#";21;1;False;Typo-Kign;dsbqo8a;The idiocracy of r/bitcoin;7opi7w;https://i.imgur.com/I2Rt4fQ.gifv

This is my first time seeing this bot or any like it. This literally changed my entire view of cryptocurrency and I was already optimistic of the premise.

Edit:
Specifically I mean a transaction on command without even any identification of the person. Like... Venmo is great or whatever, but I've not seen it integrate with an online platform this seamlessly.

It changed my view by showing a simple and open integration to multiple platforms. I believed it could be a beautiful thing, but I'd never observed it as such in action.

"There is a schism between Bitcoin users. What was one coin has now diverged into two competing coins. There's Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Cash. You need to spend time reading and observing to inform yourself with those details.

I have a few strong opinions and I am only an authority over my own opinions, but they are not specific investment suggestions which you seem to be searching for.

If you are not willing to maintain your own crypto wallet I find it difficult to ever recommend using crypto at all. You must accept the consequence that operating through an exchange means you could pay high fees or even lose your shirt. That said, utility begs that we have a means to exchange and convert our crypto for fiat or other crypto and there's a need for this because doing direct exchanges with others often times feels like the equivalent of bartering. 

That said the prevalence of crypto in society should mitigate and alleviate the need to use an exchange hub for anything other than major transactions. I don't believe the exchange market has matured enough for crypto (not enough healthy competition) and I think it will be a while before it ever does (because of regulatory pressures). 

Most of the people who are new to Bitcoin and speculating on crypto seem to be going to coinbase, and then public sentiment is being conditioned on those types of experiences.

I think there are better, more informed people to ask about this, so post your question to as many places as possible and evaluate what you're hearing. You need more concrete and detail oriented discussions about this subject. ";10;2;False;PeppermintPig;dsbpqv1;The idiocracy of r/bitcoin;7opi7w;https://i.imgur.com/I2Rt4fQ.gifv

I have nothing against LN, but they crippled the base layer for no good reason. All they have to do right now is raise the blocksize limit from 1 MB to 2MB and the fees will come down. But core developers can't do that because they would have to admin they where wrong. So now soon we will have Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Obsolete or in other words just Bitcoin again.

"this really isn't true, with 10,000,000 more users it's likely well have more nodes (which don't contribute to decentralization) and miners (that do) and if we riase blocks we'll lose *maybe 500* full nodes, so it it worth it to gain 1,000 nodes to lose 500 nodes? Or would you rather just breakj the system?

did you know Satoshi said normal users shouldn't run full nodes?

also read this

Decentralization is one of Bitcoin's main selling points. But what does it actually mean? Skip to the end for the tl;dr

**What is centralization**    
As we all know from reading everything Satoshi wrote about his design for Bitcoin from satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org, Bitcoin was finalized and born in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. In this event many normal people lost money while banking executives made more and more. 

**Where does centralization come from**       
These banks, much like the bank you probably use today, are centralized. That is, they alone control everything that happens. There is one database which has everyone's funds, if they decide you are a terrorist or something they can stop you from access your money. They can stop you from making transactions. Even if you have done nothing wrong they can stop payment on your transactions without your consent, lock you out of your funds, and monitor everything you do. 


**What  is decentralization**       
By splitting up the 'power' that a bank has we decentralize it. There is no longer any one single entity that can control txs and funds. This way no one is 'in charge' and no one can give themselves bonuses while other people lose money. This decentralization is a founding point of Bitcoin.

**Where does decentralization come from**       
Instead of one company controlling the database of funds like in the centralized model, in Bitcoin's decentralized model there are many people who can all contribute to the database and transaction processing without any one entity having full control. In Bitcoin and other POW based cryptocurrencies this decentralization is achieved by having a number of *mining nodes* who are not affiliated. As long as no group of miners controls more than 51% of the hashpower, bitcoin remains decentralized.

---


**So only mining nodes contribute to decentralization, then what about non-mining nodes**      
Non-mining nodes, full nodes, relay nodes, or storage nodes are often misunderstood to be part of decentralization. This can be easily cleared up by understanding the above information and then understanding that a non-mining node has no *power* if the majority of hashpower were to do something they didn't like. 

**I thought everyone was supposed to run a full node**      
This is another common misunderstanding, in the very beginning Satoshi did intend for everyone to run a node with 4 functions. He is very clear when he explains how this is not the way for the system to function in the future. The plan of bitcoin is that everyone can make trustless peer-to-peer transactions on a decentralized system. Not that everyone would run a home server with the whole blockchain. The business and bitcoin companies that need to have personal and instant validation of their tx can run a full nodes. Random sampling is a tried and trusted method, those unable to host their own relay node would be easily able to verify their transactions with overwhelming mathematically certainty.

**So who wants to run a full node then**     
Anyone who wants to can, it's like the Olympics, 'anyone can compete but few feel the need to'. There is no reason the network should be ground to a halt and made useless so people who can't afford to make a transaction would be able to run a full node on a 20 year old computer over a dial up connection. Bitcoin was meant to scale with technology, not become left behind. 


**What are the 4 functions that all early nodes did**       
When you read the design of Bitcoin which we all invested into, the design on which so much was built, the one at nakamotoinstitute.org, you see Satoshi mention the word 'node' many times. What we today call a full node or non-mining node usually fulfills one of those functions, that of storing the database. Finding other peers for connecting to is done by full nodes and pool operators. Sending and receiving bitcoin, aka a wallet, was also a function every node had. Finally generating coins by putting new transactions into the blockchain was the 4th thing all nodes used to do. Today these 4 actions are largely compartmentalized, as they should be in any good computer science project.

---


This is Bitcoin, some people are unhappy with the way Bitcoin was designed, well I suppose Bitcoin is simply not for those people and they should maybe find something else to do.


I hope you've all learned something today about how Bitcoin is decentralized, what is means, and how we got there.

tl;dr Banks control all txs and accounts with one database and are centralized, Bitcoin has many miners who perform this actions to make it decentralized. Non-mining nodes don't contribute to decentralization. ";3;0;False;siir;dsbt9lv;The idiocracy of r/bitcoin;7opi7w;https://i.imgur.com/I2Rt4fQ.gifv
"8MB is not so big, in 2009 building a rig to be a node was way more expensive than today, even with 8MB blocks.

Not to mention that Bitcoin is as decentralized as its miners and not its nodes, and mining requires specialized hardware already the cheapest part of which is the storage.

I would love to see an explanation as to why 8MB blocks increase centralization. But so far I just read people repeating that it does without any backup whatsoever.";3;1;False;Nibodhika;dsbk6om;The idiocracy of r/bitcoin;7opi7w;https://i.imgur.com/I2Rt4fQ.gifv

"What no one seems to point out, is that increasing the blocksize would actually _increase_ 'decentralization', to a point .... so even if 'decentralization' were the single overridingly most important factor in all of this, the argument is _still_ soo weak.

You've two curves interacting - one is what percentage of users a blocksize increase would put running a full node out of reach for (given their hardware), and the other is the overall usage+userbase increase of a blocksize increase and the corresponding expected increase in users running full nodes. 

At the current blocksize, an increase of say 4x would quickly 4x the amount of usage, and correspondingly something around 4x the number of users and thus a big increase in the number of users likely to be running nodes. At the same time, because we're talking pretty low hardware requirements still, it would only reduce the percentage of those able to run a full node by a tiny single digit percentage, leading to a huge overall gain in 'decentralization'. Obviously at some point (of further blocksize increasing() the equation would start to go in the other direction, but that's at a _much_ higher blocksize.

If you connect with many people though, strange things are going to happen. For example, say you want to buy coffee from a shop, and load 10 coffees worth into a channel with said shop.

You also open a channel with your friend Bob, because Bob is new to things.

Carol is also a patron of that coffee shop. And Bob happens to owe Carol for dinner the other day. Luckily, Bob and Carol have a valid path through you and the coffee shop.

So, Bob pays Carol via you paying the coffee shop, and the coffee shop paying Carol.

The next day, you go to buy a coffee from the shop, but find that your channel with the shop does not have enough funds to pay for the coffee... because Bob already spent your channels balance to pay Carol.";3;2;False;laskdfe;dsbhk7b;The idiocracy of r/bitcoin;7opi7w;https://i.imgur.com/I2Rt4fQ.gifv

A block is a list of transactions. When you make a transaction you peg an additional fee on to it that goes to whoever mines the block with that transaction. By paying a larger fee you're more likely to have your block mined first. As bitcoin's userbase grew there was less block space to go around so fees went up so you're block would be more likely to be mined. If bitcoin increased their blocksize there'd be space for more transactions per block, causing fees to dip.

The goal of bypassing banks entirely was grafted into the project by the cypherpunks, who saw in bitcon what they had been seeking for those 25 years: a monetary system for their utopia, an internet-based society shielded from interference by governments (and therefore that did not use banks at all).";3;0;False;jstolfi;dsaxgms;WARNING: Brutal scam.

"Social Security works exactly as designed, it is a pass-through system. It's a generational transfer, not a savings account. This is by design.

This is because society, at large, cannot save. You can't have ""growth"" by having everyone in society take their money and ""invest"" it. The only way for society to be prepared for the needs of tomorrow is to have infrastructure. The way to have infrastructure is to incentivize its development and maintenance by having demand. The way to have demand is to take money from people who would ""save"" it, and put it in the hands of people who will spend it.

Saving is an illusion for individuals. It only works if not too many people try to do it. Society can't ""save"".

"Since all he had to do was press that sweet 'realise' button, and probably why he was on there, why else open a hardware wallet? 

Its gains.

Sure he could have lost them again when the market drops, but he hadn't yet. He lost them a different way.

If you have a winning £50k scratch card in your wallet and someone steals it, you still lost £50k.

You didn't lose £2 just because you haven't taken it to the lotto office and cashed it in yet. You still lost something with £50k value.

What you're saying is... 

You bought £1k of bitcoin and its £1m now - you haven't gained yet. 

You sell the bitcoin for GBP - You haven't gained yet, it's in a bank account, that means it's only insured for £75k.

You take out the £1m in cash - You haven't gained yet, someone could steal that cash, or the value of the cash could change with inflation.

You buy a house with the £1m - You haven't gained yet, the house could burn down, or the housing market could crash.

You die. Leaving an estate of & 1m. - You haven't gained yet, there will be taxes.

Your wife inherits and so no taxes - You haven't gained yet, she might squander it.

She gets kidnapped and £1m is taken. - Oh well you only lost £1k.



What happens if you 'realise' your gains, then put them back into something else. Are they still gains, or are they no longer gains because they're on something else?

If they aren't really gains, then what are the gains on those gains in the new investment? That's some 2nd level non-existence. If I buy a sandwich with the gains on the gains, will I still be hungry because the sandwich never existed?

"Great questions. I think existing precedent in the US would be if you were generating wallets and checking their balance with the intent to take money if they happened to hit on one containing coin, then yes, you are committing a crime. This would be analogous to printing up millions of physical keys and using them to open doors, saying ""hey if I happen to own the key I can take it!""

This is a good point. I have a ledger and actually have no idea.

There is also an associated problem, again that I have read nothing about, in that with insufficient entropy, if enough units were sold, the probability of two users generating the same keys would be appreciable, and you could end up with your coins stolen by chance.

Do you think a Ledger (for example) is much less reliable than an alternative approach? To me, it seems the probability of a hardware weakness (and any single individual ultimately being a victim of it) is pretty low compared with other attacks that can affect *any* system, like falling for scams, having your computer backdoored by a virus, having keys or seeds lost or stolen (physically), perhaps by someone you trusted, etc. I don't have answers to these questions but I would guess, for example, that risk of loss from having a seed back-up physically stolen in some way (however it was generated) is *far* greater than a hardware wallet being compromised. (A slight aside, I could easily imagine a rise in computer theft in future, not for the hardware, but for the possibility of grabbing hardware that contained private keys to crypto wallets.);2;1;False;timmerwb;dsb7cmy;I am the guy that lost £25000 due to Ledger scam (not $34000 life savings);7ojvca;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7ojvca/i_am_the_guy_that_lost_25000_due_to_ledger_scam/

"The seller took control of the buyer's property. It is theft.

Edit: Imagine a roommate sells you a new safe, then gives you a ""free"" spare lock to go with it, and you replace the safe lock with the free lock. Then in the middle of the night the roommate goes up to the safe and takes everything in it. It would be unrealistic to argue in court that because the buyer replaced the lock with a lock someone else knew the combination of, that everything put in the safe was equally his. Also, it was so deceptive that that alone could be enough of a case.

In either case, even if a criminal case cannot be made, sufficient evidence or testimony may exist to win a civil case for all the victims (where the standard to win a lawsuit is lower than in a criminal trial).";2;0;False;AcerbLogic;dsb9i5j;I am the guy that lost £25000 due to Ledger scam (not $34000 life savings);7ojvca;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7ojvca/i_am_the_guy_that_lost_25000_due_to_ledger_scam/
"""little to do"" is an understatement. This attack vector can entirely be avoided by avoiding a third party, which introduces another element of trust.

I have seen retards defend this because of the firmware chip, etc. But what if it's just a fake device that pretends to be authentic. It does not even have to function as a wallet.

At least in the U.S., I don't think establishing theft of crypto-currencies including BTC as a crime will be much of a challenge, since the FBI has already publicly auctioned quite a bit for cash. Moreover, two U.S. federal agents, Shaun Bridges and Carl Mark Force IV, have been charged at least partially for stealing bitcoins during their corrupt Silk Road investigations ([article](https://www.wired.com/2016/02/corrupt-silk-road-investigator-re-arrested-trying-to-flee-the-us/)).

"You are wrong. Lots of fake shit on there unless you are buying from an authorized reseller. The vendor can confirm this.

Amazon is a marketplace. They usually don't actually sell things. They are just offering a platform. I can sell my products on Amazon if I want.

"Two separate issues. One was I had two unconfirmed transactions in the mobile app inside my wallet, next time I open my wallet the transactions have dissapeared. Literally disappeared. Ruled out human error as far as is humanly possible. Generated the first 20,000 addresses from the seed incase it was a gap issue. Nothing. Coins are confirmed in the 2 addresses never to be accessible again. 

Second (40btc) was my fault. After the original issue above I generated a new wallet in the app, didn't make a backup of the seed and used a dummy email address. Accidentally gave out an address from that wallet to someone. Deleted the app without thinking, no record of the wallet identifier. Trying to recover these with supports help but I'm not holding my breath. This originally happened beginning of this year. About £170k at the time. Now around £2m without fork coins.

"Yeah, but what laws did he broke exactly? ""Theft of digital asset""? Are cryptocurrencies even an asset? Also, the seller sold a ledger and he complied with the sale. Did the sale implied a transfer of a private key? Also, can we really determine, legally that knowing 24 words in a certain order in memory represents ownership? 

As you can see this is very complicated as the very concept of ""ownership"" in decentralized world is very complicated as there's no such thing as ownership in the first place. You do not ""own"" anything. There isn't a tie between a physical entity and a value in a database.

Be real, there are legit companies and exchanges scamming us out of crypto investments and people that had their money disappear facing no consequences.

Assuming you can sell it for £125,000 to a legit buyer without being scammed or mislead (i.e. less than the Antiques Roadshow optimistic estimate), some way down the road you will be left with some profit (~50%, after tax and fees), at which time you might find that a similar vase sold at auction in the US for twice what you sold yours because the situation was more favorable.

You might not like Ripple, but at least it has a business model, capable of turning a profit. And yes, that includes XRP. The problem with Reddit is that often the opinions expressed here don't make good business or financial sense. Most of the people who are participating in the great crypto frenzy right now aren't motivated by noble sentiments.

"Haha! Yeaaaaaah of course Ripple is a shitcoin. Keep repeating this to yourself if you want but it won’t make it true. It’s just your silly opinion. Ripple is far from being a shitcoin, it’s one of the few coins out there with real world use case that will be used by major actors, but hey, it’s alright, you’re free to keep your head in the sand if you want!

Not defensive, more like tired of the bullshit you toxic fudsters and trolls regurgitate daily against Ripple. There is so much lies and FUD out there it’s incredible and annoying as hell when you try to stay informed and have to go through all the lies to find some truth. Uninformed people take it for granted and even propagate those lies further. 

It has to stop. Stop the tribalism! You’re part of everything that is wrong in crypto right now. I’m just doing my part to clear some noise. It’s always the same FUD arguments debunked time and time again that comes back, could you at least do some research or be honest enough to stop misleading people? If you are having fun trolling and fudding, I’m having fun bringing back balance and truth to the table. To each their own, I prefer to side by the truth and stay positive instead of keeping myself in lies, toxicity and negativity.

The blockchain technology will be used in a whole lot of other applications than what Bitcoin is after. Get on with it. Stop hating what is different and manipulating others against it just because you can. Grow up. If you want the project you support to succeed just spread the word on how great it is and let the people decide what they prefer. Constructive criticism is always welcome, not lies and baseless FUD.

"Yes we all know there is no mining go on for XRP. But it doesn't matter if the founders of a coin mine themselves at low difficulty for 5 months before release, thereby accumulating a vast store, or if they simply assign themselves 100 billion tokens at the outset (like for XRP). The result is the same, developers or founders of a coin, starting with a huge amount of that coin. And that l think is what people often mean by ""premine"". But yeah maybe ""pre-allocated"" would be better, or coin a catchy term if you have one (see the pun there, lol).

A lot of ICOs actually have this kind of feature, especially utility tokens, except that unlike XRP many coins also go to ICO participants, with some reserved for the founders. I think XRP is pretty unique in that it was 100% pre-allocated. Is there any other coin that has that property?

Don't you think it's possible that some of the core developers have been deceived themselves? I mean I see developers making commits for Bitcoin ABC and for Bitcoin Core.  Except for the liars and the toxic people imho if other core developers just admin that they where wrong they can write code for Bitcoin ABC it's all the same to me. If they do a good job I am even willing to fund them with a bit of Bitcoin Cash (if my income keeps growing).
