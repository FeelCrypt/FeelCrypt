"I looked into the German guidance again. If I understand the situation right, then

1.  cryptos are treated similar to vouchers if you want to buy and sell them (no VAT). The German ruling is based on the ECJ ruling on a case about buying and selling BTC:

>The transactions that Mr Hedqvist intends to carry out are thus limited to the purchase and sale of ‘bitcoin’ virtual currency units in exchange for traditional currencies, such as the Swedish crown, or vice versa. It is not apparent from the order for reference that those transactions would include payments made using ‘bitcoin’.

2. If you use crypto to pay for services/goods, again you don't have to pay VAT on the cryptos you buy for that purpose and apart from the normal VAT, you don't have to pay any taxes on top.

It is important that this is tax guidance, not some groundbreaking ruling that equates private money and legal tender. 

Mildly interesting is that mining is VAT-free according to the letter and also mildly interesting is that it accepts the existence of crypto as some kind of private money that people are free to use. 

>That being said, you would still be taxed if you convert your bitcoin to fiat (as I understand). 

Yes, just not VAT. But capital gains taxes apply (if you sell before 12m) and IMO also income tax, but other German redditors think different. Exchanging BTC for BCH would still be a taxable event, but again capital gains taxes, not VAT. The guidance is only concerned with VAT (which in Germany is a federal tax, unlike the USA).

So, I am not really sure the situation is that different from the USA.";2;0;False;ABoutDeSouffle;dv8gl7u;Germany Recognizes Bitcoin as Legal Tender, Updates Taxes.

"All, as the title states crypto users will not be taxed for using crypto as a means of payment. For example, if you buy a coffee in Germany with bitcoins you won’t be taxed on your purchase like you would in the US/CAD. In the US/CAD, crypto is treated as a commodity, so barter rules apply when you buy “stuff” like coffee. 

So in the US, the fair market value (FMV) of your coffee at the time of purchase is determined, and it is considered that you sold your crypto for that value. So if you had bought the bitcoin for a $1 and spent it on coffee that was worth $10, you would be taxed for the $9 gain. 

NOW - in Germany, that is not the case. You can buy the coffee and because the bitcoin is not a commodity, you don’t have to consider FMV or anything. You’ll still pay sales taxes etc. on that coffee, the same as you would had you paid in cash. You will also STILL pay taxes if you sell your bitcoin for Fiat in Germany. 

Hopefully that clears up a lot of your questions. I’m also basing this all on the article as I’m not German nor am I a tax professional, so take this with a grain of salt.
