">The Lighting Network is unworkable, so what are they aiming for? 

To delay Bitcoin adoption as much as possible. To have two camps fight each other to death. (Cobracoin is a very clear example of this, have both camps talk about him and make spectators thing the only thing we ever do is fight the other camp). They go to /r/bitcoin and attack /r/btc. They go to /r/btc and attack /r/bitcoin. 

Everything to prevent Bitcoin adoption going exponential.  The tactics is one of the oldest in the books. First ""divide and conquer"", then ""divide and rule"".  Combined with ""[pressure from above and below](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPd0Sg42Cvo)"". 

These are proven tactics and work in almost any domain.  Then there is also the blowing up of the market price (Tether). What ever group is attacking the concept of ""Bitcoin"" does not  see a threat in Bitcoin being a hyper investment or a speculative vehicle or simply a form of stock. 

It's the currency and the new money that will shake and undermine the current powers and when money becomes borderless it's the beginning of a wave of globalization  (because trade can now be done worldwide with a borderless currency) and  the blurring of nation states. Mega companies like Google are already kind of blurring this. All of this is the beginning of a one world currency.  However Satoshi was first and introduced a one world currency that nobody controls. (as long as we don't end up with one person having 99% of the coins)  

The only way to fight this is to get locally active, to turn it in to a movement. To show person by person, merchant by merchant the benefits it can have for them to start using crypto. This phase easily might take 20 years and still depends on the internet remaining free and open (a WWIII would probablly destroy the current internet) 

I don't necessarily need to see BCH go global and become the currency of the internet. Any crypto will do. I see every crypto that tries to be currency as Bitcoin. (that's why I don't mind Ethereum at all and don't believe in all the new technology we could put in BCH to make it more like Ethereum, like colored coins and stuff). But in the end by definition only one can become the global currency, not two. 

If Bitcoin adoption would take of at the same time as a big financial crisis ... well every time something like that happens it becomes harder and harder to stop this  technology from changing the internet and eventually changing the answer to the question: ""What is money?"". This also radically changes the way nation states are structured because tax is paid in the currency of the nation. Now a nation state needs to collect tax in the form of a global currency. That changes a lot of dynamics.  How do you fund wars when you can't control how much money you print? 

Big businesses and banks being forced to participate in crypto also have a problem because of the transparent nature of Bitcoin. For a big business to  receive payments on Bitcoin addresses it would be hard for them to avoid taxes since the blockchain is a open document.

Personally I agree, I don't really care what anyone calls it. But you have to realize the history of this term.

If it's just a name and it's silly, why do you think core cares so much? It seems extremely clear to me that they feel the name bitcoin cash is a risk to them. This is why they employ useful idiots and an army of trolls to go around writing bcash everywhere. It's a big part of their plan apparently since they seem to focus on this aspect so heavily.

1. He has an interaction with a rnorthkorea mod outside of rnorthkorea

3. He gets banned

Maybe mod just waited for him to comment anything so he can ban him?

"I think the past US election gave a textbook on how to divide a community. Same principles were applied. People talk more about the macro-level environments of each coin instead of the actual tech. It seems impossible to talk about the advantages of any crypto without someone trying to shit on someone or something in that community.

Now don't get me wrong, the hate for /r/bitcoin *is mostly justified*. Their moderation style is something that I don't agree with, and they clearly have an agenda. However, we don't really need to shit all over Bitcoin as well as /r/bitcoin. You can't take the worst of a community and hold it up as the example of the typical user. It doesn't work that way.

Honestly, in my crypto circle... we literally have no agenda. We can talk about any coin or tech, and the questions are more of a ""interesting... tell me more"", instead of ""shitcoin"" or defensive comments.
