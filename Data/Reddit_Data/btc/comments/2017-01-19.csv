* Jerome: @charlieshrem Why donâ€™t you use Paypal and leave Bitcoin alone?

this how some BS/Core fundamentalists promote bitcoin - they say use pay-pal

it's like just showing interest in bigger blocks is trolling and if you think bitcoin should upgrade to bigger blocks you should forget bitcoin and move to paypal - as that some how solves the problems bitcoin solves.

"u/brg444 it's a little frustrated to see all this attention on the fees. - just extrapolate fee growth in a liner chart and pick the point when most users abandon bitcoin, that's how the fee market ends. 

Now and for the practical future fees are largely irrelevant to scaling bitcoin, it's about increasing the network of users. I agree some mandatory fee is necessary in the case the network is being abused with spam but it need not be greater than $0.005 for fresh transactions to be effective.

Bitcoin has an inflation subsidy given to miners to lubricate cooperation between network participants thus creating and giving the bitcoin network value.

The subsidy comes from the inflation of the money supply paid by all those invested in bitcoin's success, it is a tax that subsidized security and writing of transactions to the blockchain. 

At the moment the cost per transaction is over 96% subsidized. bother sides of this debate are focusing on the fee per transaction as if it's too cheep or too expensive, that's not an issue today or in the practical future, nor is the networks under threat of huge blocks that can only be processed by data-centers.

Looking at manipulating fees now is ludicrous and incredibly shortsighted, especially using fee pressure, created by limited block space, to justify a fee market.

How can any rational person look at <4% of the bitcoin transaction cost and come to a definitive conclusion about what the total fee should be. Whatever method is used it will be wrong given the subsidy is decreasing by 50% every 4 years. An instant 50% increase in cost is sure to disrupt an existing supply and demand equilibrium in a free market no mater how predictable it is due to limited knowledge of every market participants future fee tolerance.

If fees were an order of magnitude cheaper or more expensive they would still be largely irrelevant and most notably distorted by the subsidy. How can a free market determine a value for a service when the service is >96% subsidized.

BS/Core Fundamentalists are being incredibly irresponsible by enforcing a fee market by limiting block size now and big block proponents are being naive complaining about the transaction cost when the fee paid is +-<4% of the subsidized cost.

It's only with economies of scale in transaction volume and a resulting increase in block size that we can maintain the existing level of security as the reward drops.
