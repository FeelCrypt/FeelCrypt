They are straight up criticizing people for discussing interesting stories about products they like, and for recommending inventions that have genuinely enriched their lives.

Is there potentially undercover paid marketing happening in anonymous forums? Sure. That is a tradeoff of anonymous forums, so reader beware.

But even given that reality, a poster's activities can be paid for out of profits and still be considered useful or interesting by the end reader.

I prefer paid marketing efforts to be identified as such, and to know who is doing the typing. But I can't criticize the content on that basis alone.

Roger Ver, for instance, stands to benefit as BCH grows market share. But BCH supporters are correct to point out that this fact does not negate any of his points or observations.

Similarly, people who make a living helping promote a brand may very much raise interesting or worthwhile points in reference to that brand.

> The money is not locked to that channel, it can go on any channel. [It is available for on chain transactions]

Yes it is locked and no, it can't go to any other channel and it is **not available** for on-chain transactions.
The funds are locked up in a 2-by-2 multisig onchain.

It can only be transferred between the two parties (on-chain or via LN) as a direct payment or routed payment for third parties.
The only way that funds can leave that channel is by closing the channel and settling on-chain.

"You do understand that routing payments for third parties can rebalance your channel?

> I don't think LN proponents see the net receiver perspective

Probably because the ""net receiver perspective"" is less restricted if you route payments.

Edit, example:

**Z <-> ... <-> You <-> Merchant <-> ... <-> Y**

You continue to pay to the merchant until your channel is exhausted/unbalanced. You now cannot pay the merchant anymore (unless you happen to have another route to them).

Y now pays to Z and the payment is being routed via the merchant and you.

Your channel with the merchant is thus rebalanced and you can start paying the merchant again.";5;2;False;BitcoinSatellite;dugl9rt;Rick Falkvinge on the Lightning Network: Requirement to have private keys online, routing doesn't work, legal liability for nodes, and reactive mesh security doesn't work;7yfjkn;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFZOrtlQXWc

"I disagree with you for one as a user I don't want to have my wallet online 24/7 because the best security is not being online at all.  My wallet is offline most of the time.  Also I don't leave my phone online 24/7 either.  On chain transactions can still occur even if I'm an offline.  I can obtain my receipts when I choose to come online.

As a merchant, I'm planning to market items accepting Bitcoin Cash, I can choose to use a third party, Bitpay, or directly accept payment via my address.  How I choose to accept payment should not be coersed by LN.  Also I don't want to tie up my funds in a LN node requiring 2 on chain transactions especially incurring BTC's high fees.

2) If LN doesn't solve routing then there is absolutely no need to use LN.   You might as well do your transaction on chain and it is peer-to-peer.  Bitcoin Cash guarantees that your transaction will be in the next block and it fast, reliable and cheap.

3) The correct answer is True. There is a liability therefore your answer is deceptive. The hubs provides a temporary loan by forwarding its money to the recipient.  The hub then clears the loan with the sender funds and charges the sender a fee for the use of its money.  Because the hubs is now in the business of monetary exchange it comes under the purview of banking regulations and legal liability.

3) LN weakens security because LN will open the door to a bank run because there is not enough space on the blockchain for the miners to settle the LN transactions.  Hubs will compete to have their transactions cleared thus raising the price of on chain transaction to such a level that individuals can only afford to do LN transaction and only through a hub large enough that they can afford the on chain fee to have their transaction cleared.

Why then is only one party the custodian? I don't feel like this claim holds up, but of course, that could stem from a misunderstanding.

I am making the assumption that for the most part, one party will be providing an ""open a channel with me"" service. Regardless of who chooses to open and who chooses to accept, there will always be an offer-accept sequence, even between friends.

Since people who use this service need to deposit funds into the opened channel, regulators will regard this as falling under custodian-of-funds regulation.

LN introduces credit.

If a merchant wants to receive money on LN, he must convince a node to lock up money even before he has done a sale.

First, the merchant must guess his turnover. Let's say $5000 USD the next month.

Then he must convince a node to lock up $5000 USD worth of money in a channel to him.

This is almost like a loan. The merchant will have to pay the interest on this frozen capital. Even if he doesn't get a single sale.

"**Must  be online to receive**

True, but it's not a showstopper. Merchants who would tend to lose business during a connection outage probably also wouldn't risk maintaining their own Bitcoin node and would pay a third-party anyway for that service (BitPay, ...).

**Routing is unsolved**

True, but not a showstopper. Routing does not need to be solved in the mathematical sense as long as it is good enough for the LN use case.


**Legal liability for nodes**

False. You don't deposit money with a custodian. The other party does not control your funds, you do. If you want to take your money out, the other party can't prevent it. If regulators want to regulate multisig and smart contracts, then preventing LN won't stop them.
