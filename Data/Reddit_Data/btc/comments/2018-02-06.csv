"Not so, it's a scam. 

Take California. They got the state lottery passed by making a law saying that all proceeds from the lottery would be spent on the schools. Everyone thought this was a great idea.

About $300 million was generated for schools the next year. And all of it went to the schools. So technically they weren't lying.

What actually happened is that the state reduced state funding to schools by $300 million and allowed lottery money to plug the gap. Total school funding did not increase at all, and the legislators got $300m in play money for free to spend on w/e they wanted, and it was all technically legal.

"I don't know if you're memeing or being serious.

With crypto, the players are just other people in the world. Go up, go down, its a 0 sum game. People are buying and selling with no way of enforcing transactions or ensuring that people actually get paid and are secure (I'm looking at you Mt. Gox). In this way, it is the wild fucking west and its gambling.

""But bewilderment, muh block chain."" Yeah, you know how block chain works? Its a global ledger of every transaction ever made and transactions are validated and added to the ledger by validating hashes (reversing them) which can take half an hour. So imagine waiting half an hour at a supermarket register to buy a pack of gum. 

Or in the case of buying and selling crypto, imagine you're trading Litecoin for Bit or cashing out. Now, you submit a transaction. When does the buy or sell order go through? When the exchange is validated or when its initiated? At the end of the day, the ledger only records a transaction between 1 wallet and another on the same coin. How you cash out is an entirely different system NOT enforced by blockchain (but durr we can build more block chains. Yeah fuck not gonna even discuss that.)

With a lottery, the players are the people and the government where the government is giving away the money and the people are buying into the game. At least in this way, the game is regulated and there are multiple safeguards for playing (age restriction, guarentee of payment, spelling out what it means to buy a lottery ticket, and gambling addiction help ) and at the end of the day, the lottery is used as essentially a tax on people who are bad at math and just want an emotional adrenaline kick. At least the money goes to a public cause.

Its the difference between riding a bicycle with training wheels and a motorcycle at a grand prix, both without prior training.

You actually think a majority of the people buying crypto know what the fuck they're doing? No. Absolutely not. If you ask them what the value of any particular crypto is, they couldn't fucking distinguish Eth from Bitcoin. All they know is ""durr it goes up I must buy and watch the investment go up because it goes up.""

And when these idiots spend lose their life savings in the bubble, who's gonna pick up the tab? The government. These idiots spend the rest of their lives on welfare and the government needs to support them. So how about they just fucking not let people ruin their own lives to begin with?";1;0;False;bewilderment_;dtt9at4;"Government: ""Cryptocurrencies are too risky.""

With that being said, I believe btc will rise again due to speculation of course, but I think what all btc holders should really be betting on is the adoption of lightening network for continuing long term growth. I have my own opinions about how that’ll work out, but that’s not really important. 

What’s important, is that LN could make or break bitcoin, IMO. We’ll just have to see if the devs are able to pull it off, adoption and all. If that doesn’t happen, maybe a completely separate coin will beat btc and bch.

If you mean that newer experimetnal technologies have appeared in the ecosystem then I'm sure there is a lot of experiments going on. But for me Bitcoin doesn't start and finish with the technological aspect... for me Bitcoin a genius consensus system leveraged on technology to maintain an equilibrium of incentives. I'm not interested in the change of the technology for the sake of it, but for evolving that system, respecting the spirit behind its inception, its incentives system, the proved POW mechanism, and make them work better without changing them fundamentally, which is the opposite of what Core was perpetrating with the old Bitcoin, poor old Bitcoin.;1;0;False;Itilvte;dttodhv;When you bought in December;7vky4d;https://v.redd.it/0gp95uf9tie01
Ok,my opinion now nothing really to back it up with, Bitcoin Core and Blockstream have squandered their 1st mover advantage by their intransigent and obdurate refusal to promptly address the scaling requirements and instead have proffered complexity and complexity to deal with an issue that should have been dealt with in a common sense manner. Their not so well hidden agendas have destroyed the speed and cost advantage and with it the value of Bitcoin Core. On August 1st 2017 Bitcoin Cash picked up Satoshi's vision and moved forward. Bitcoin Core is a failing experiment and as more people become aware of the limitations and compromises that the core solutions entail the wiser heads will be leaving quietly and making other arrangements. You can fool some of the people some of the time and Bitcoin Core has been counting on that for a while the rest of us who won't be fooled have already moved on. In my opinion, Bitcoin is irrelevant and this is soley because of the Core Devs actions over the last 4 year span. They have destroyed the essential utility of Bitcoin and perhaps that was what they were paid to do.;5;1;False;;dttjoyz;When you bought in December;7vky4d;https://v.redd.it/0gp95uf9tie01

"> Bcash didn't address that, it delayed the inevitable.

If you mean Bitcoin Cash, it does address the scaling theme in the way it was supposed to be since the beginning, the way it works, because there never was a scaling problem.  Bitcoin Cash devs are developing many interesting technologies for making sure of that there wont ever be a scaling problem at all (graphene, subchains, weakblocks, etc.).

Only there is a scaling problem for BTC, because Core made sure of that, by artificially crippling the system and spreading FUD regarding ""centralization concerns"", like if there were no bigger concerns in the centralization of the development by a malicious or incompetent dev team.

> A scam for non techies

That would be BTC, with its censored, non-transparent community where no technical discussions or any kind of criticism is allowed, with all the propaganda and the kool-aid people drink there like if it was milk and honey.

> BTC is actually addressing in production already through LN & Segwit

Bad pre-alpha hyper-complex technology that isn't intended as a scaling system and that wont work as advertised, with many problems of its own, mainly on routing and security, and that fundamentally changes the incentives system and the network topology that Bitcoin had to a much more vulnerable and centralized one.

> Bcash is literally BTC 6+ months ago with 1 integer changed.

If you mean Bitcoin Cash, you are literally lying.

"Infinite growth is possible but human nature makes us look at timescales that are relevant to us.

ADHD Investors want things quickly and if its not happening they get disappointed and move on.  $100k Bitcoin with $5000 transaction fees is useless. I think that Bitcoin is going to get the Coup De Grace from China when they Nationalise all Bitcoin Miners as a strategic asset and force miners to use their Hash Power to secure the Digital Yuan or Digital Renimbi.

I'm not following these stats, LN is still in test phase, just some are using it already in mainnet, but now i had a little time to check the charts, and [this clearly shows](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/transactionfees-transactions-btc.html#1y) in the past year there was no exact correlation between the tx numbers and the fee, the fee's dropped even with constant usage and increased later, there have been over 350k tx's with the highest fee, and dropping usage didn't essentially lowered the fee's. It is partly true less usage will lower fees because of less race condition for confirmations, but a lot of other things will affect it too. For example if often used services overpay the tx, then it will cause high fees, and a lot of services doesn't let the users set the fee, because it is calculated automatically, and sometimes very badly. For example last year in the blockchain.info wallet the default tx fee was a few times more than what was needed, ok there is an option to set it by yourself, but a lot of people didn't know that (later they changed the all fee setting form). So in nutshell, the fees can drop by lower usage, and by other things too, it's not definitely a strict connection.;1;1;False;gecikopter;dtsngnn;As requested, a picture of a dinosaur holding Bitcoin, while mammals are poised to adapt for the future;7v6hhb;https://i.redd.it/72qgbct2x6e01.jpg

2. Make the meteors a green hue (may require altering the sky hue generally), remove the BS ring logo, put the Bitcoin Cash green tilted Bitcoin symbol in the middle and maybe a ring of text around the inside edge of the meteor saying 'low fees', 'reliable confirmations'.

3. Make the squirrels hodl orange BTC (let's face it, these particular ones aren't going to live long)

"> So basically you're saying that BCH is a short term solution correct? It doesn't solve the problem but it reduces it without much effort. 

No, I think BCH is a long-term solution. There is no going back from that fork. BTC shed community and developers and they coalesced around BCH.

We can scale on-chain using BCH for a very long time before we would absolutely need to use secondary layers, that fact is why so many are upset with Core for trying to force everyone onto layer-2 solutions prematurely.
