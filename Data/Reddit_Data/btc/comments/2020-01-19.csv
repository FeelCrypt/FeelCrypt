Not infinitely. There are still a limited amount of total available private keys, but even though it's highly unlikely somebody will generate the same private key as another, there's still a *chance* that it can happen, especially if quantum computing grows in that direction.

"Love the concept. I'm working on a similar thing right now for one of my own projects, but I'm committed to the goal that it will be able to be self-hosted, and will *not* require the merchant to share an xpub key with an external service (for privacy reasons).

However, as I design the API, I keep coming back to the realisation that deploying a self-hosted solution for BCH will never be as quick and easy as integrating a someone-else hosted solution. That makes it hard for a self-hosted solution to match the ease of integration offered by Stripe, PayPal, etc. For that reason, I'm really glad someone is working on an other-person hosted solution. This should be a great thing for more online adoption.

Another inspiration source for me has been the BrainBlocks API for Nano payments. Worth checking out if you haven't seen it.

next block fee is the amount you'd need to pay to have near-certainty that your transaction will be in the next block.  median fee is the median fee being paid.  the next block fee can be much higher than the median because in order to predict with near-certainty you have to take into account the high variability in fees.;4;1;False;jessquit;ff0z6wo;Bitcoin Fees: Bitcoin Cash $0.00 🙂 / Bitcoin Core $1.42 ☹️;eqznmi;https://i.redd.it/9ctlmnd4yrb41.jpg

"Not a CashFusion developer, but was part of the closed alpha and saw a lot of the internal discussion a while ago.

Originally the goal for CashFusion was to serve as the consolidation tool for post-CashShuffle UTXOs. Over time it became much bigger than that, and is now essentially CashShuffle 2.0. So Fusions can both consolidate, or spread out UTXOs. Either in multiple Fusions, or in the same Fusion.

If I recall correctly, due to the staggering number of possible combinations due to the high number of inputs and outputs, you can safely consolidate UTXOs into an address after a few Fusions.

">that kind of hard for them to knowingly ""consent""

Hitler was very explicit in his 25 point plan from 1920. He established in points 4 and 6 that Jews shall not be able to influence “Leadership and laws” in any way. Means even back in 1920 they would know that they wouldn‘t be able to influence public policy in any way.

More clearly, in point 18, he calls for the **death penalty** for ""profiteers, racketeers, \[...\]"".

Also, Hitler published a book, where all Jews could read up on his views. That was public knowledge.

But at least you have to agree that, following your logic, the Jews consented to the Nürnberg Laws (1935)?

>they werent allowed to leave (after 41)

That means they could have left for a whole of 8 years of NSDAP rule. And a lot of them did leave.

>equating the holocaust with taxation

Where did I equate the both?

I‘m just saying, if we apply your logic (“if you don‘t leave you consent”) we get to very awkward conclusions. It‘s an argumentum ad adsurdum.

We both agree that the Jews didn‘t consent to the Holocaust by staying. Staying in the country did not make it not consent. And it doesn‘t make it consent today.

Also, if leaving the country allows me to not pay taxes, which country should I go to? There‘s no way to evade taxation legally on this planet.

you stretched your credibility with that line of argument. a good indicator for this is asking yourself the question: if you were a jew in, say 38, would you think that the state had the right to exterminate you for being jewish? the answer is no, and it should be obvious because, while many fled already, you can be 100% sure all jews would have left the instant a law like that would come into place. you can cite hitlers plans etc, but that does not make it law back then.

> But at least you have to agree that, following your logic, the Jews consented to the Nürnberg Laws (1935)?

you could say that, if it wasnt because the nuremberg laws removed their citizen rights, rights to fair trial.

one could also argue that the nuremberg laws was such a great change to the current status quo that people living there did not consent to when they decided to live there, which is not the case for taxation which has existed for hundreds or thousands of years there (although racist laws were pretty common at the time).

basically you are arguing that you also have an inalienable right not to be taxed, along with your inalienable right to life. do we have an inalienable right not to be taxed?.

"Your line of reasoning regarding the *legality* of the Holocaust and the mass-murder does make sense. I concede that and will have to think about that some more.

>one could also argue that the  nuremberg laws was such a great change to the current status quo that  people living there did not consent to when they decided to live there,  which is not the case for taxation which has existed for hundreds or  thousands of years there (although racist laws were pretty common at the  time).

I find this, however, a very weak argument, and you‘re even weakening it yourself.

~~The~~ My argument is that people that did not leave *after the laws have been enacted* consented  (according to your logic). Not that people consented who were suddenly subject to new laws.

>you can be 100% sure all jews would have left the instant a law like that would come into place

Now this is where our disagreement arises, I think. If Germany actually did what you just described—enact the murder of all Jews in Germany into law, while giving the option to leave—, would it be morally OK for Germany to kill all Jews in Germany?

In my moral framework, no.

How about yours? From the information given, I suspect it would be yes.

>you could say that, if it wasnt because the nuremberg laws removed their citizen rights, rights to fair trial.

Just to clarify, my argument here is that those who stayed did consent, according to your logic.

>do we have an inalienable right not to be taxed

Yes. It‘s called right to private property.

>its not really the country you live in that has the responsibility to make all sorts of other options available to you.

I don‘t understand this sentence.

>in the end, when you take a job you  know beforehand you will taxed. you take the job knowing this. no one is  forcing you to take the job, or forcing you to even be in the country.  it is absolutely up to yourself this question. when you take the job you  consent to pay the taxes you kniw you will have to pay, just like  getting behind the wheel makes you consent to abiding by the rules of  the road.

Now you‘re shifting the argument. Before, it was “you consent by staying in a country”. Now it‘s “you consent by working”. Which one is it?

Also, what about all other taxes? Property taxes, value added taxes, dog taxes, dance taxes, inheritance taxes...

Further, you didn‘t answer my question, you only raised new ones. How can it be consent if it is impossible to avoid the consequences, i.e. I cannot legally *not* pay taxes anywhere on earth?

>as i wrote to another poster: would  it still ve theft if it was a corporation that owned all the land and  you had to pay tax when you worked in their land?

No, it wouldn‘t be theft.

And no, those two scenarios are not comparable.

* A state has jurisdiction, which it aquired non-peacefully.

"> I'm just pointing out that statism isn't outright stupidity

I agree. It's a question of degree. This is, for example, the difference between a libertarian (as I am) and an anarchist (which Roger Ver is). A libertarian believes some *very minimal* government or State can create a better overall environment for a group of people. That's how the U.S. was founded. An anarchist wants zero government. 

Contrast this with someone who desires socialism or communism, which both mean a very big, powerful government or State. A libertarian rejects that ideology as harmful, as I do.

>I'm talking about pragmatism and bringing more people into the fold for BCH. I'll reiterate, they aren't stupid, they're doing what is in their best interests and in their skillsets so that they can correctly evaluate outcomes.

I understand what you mean. In the U.S. political system we have many politicians who are ignorant of many things they have influence over, such as the real reason the Second Amendment was drafted, or which system of economics works best for ordinary people. It's not that they are stupid. As you say, they have differing skills and backgrounds. However, they are often ignorant. Ignorance can be corrected (with education).

"> Does a person located a stone away from the lines of the border makes one less of a human?

Not at all, but it can make them more likely to believe in, and want to support certain ideologies, things shunned by the group they might wish to join. For example, the United States was founded on the idea of freedom and power to ordinary individuals. The idea was all the wealth and power in the society should be kept structured bottom up, not top down as with a king or communist dictator (see N. Korea, China, Venezuela etc). 

So people who want to be in the United States should believe in the values that country represents. However, not all people share this thinking. For example, many do believe there should be a  big, powerful government that manages everything, where rulers decide for themselves regardless to what people on the bottom want (this is why Hong Kong protesters struggled so long, against ruling China). Such people believe the governing system should be communism, or socialism which supports this view. Another example is religious or philosophical views. Again, in the U.S. we uphold freedom in everything, which includes freedom of religion, and freedom for women. In places like Iran that's not the dominant thinking. Women are often mandated to wear full face coverings (burkas), women can be killed by their family for going against marital wishes; rulers in Iran said there were no homosexuals in the country, and ones found could be (and I believe have been) thrown off buildings. Contrast that to the U.S. were we have a homosexual openly running for president.

So borders are important. You can't simply allow an unlimited number of people, who believe all manner of things, to infiltrate and influence the environment and political outcome of your country, or your country can cease looking the way it was meant to look. That's what people don't understand about Donald Trump, and why he prioritizes defending the border  and citizenship system of the U.S. It's not about hating other humans or thinking one type human is ""lower"" than another type. It's about protecting the values of the group that exists in the country already.

Iranians can and have become U.S. citizens. The same with people from South America. But in doing so the proper legal way they swear allegiance to the same values of the existing system. That's exactly how it should be.";3;1;False;cryptos4pz;fez2lou;I hope it will take a while until the BCH community will be as flooded with statists as the BTC community [see comments].

"> It's not smartness. It's differing skillsets and specialization in an enormous society.

No, it's smartness. The bottom line is the more free people are the more they thrive. This has been shown with countless examples. 

Insisting on ideologies which seek to limit the freedom and power of the individual while increasing the power of the state consistently result in a lower standard of living for the majority of individuals, living on the bottom, while people at the top who are often hypocritical about the taboo things others are prohibited from doing (like watching porn, which is illegal in N. Korea), retain the high standards of living, wealth and power.

"> And if there is inflation it should go to the people.

This is what a gold standard provides. Monetary inflation literally means the expansion of the currency supply. So, for example, if gold is used as the currency how is more gold, that currency supply, expanded? It's mined. More gold enters the system as a result of human labor. The increase in yearly gold supply roughly matches the increase in human population (about 1% per year), which makes it perfect to use as currency, since the resulting prices of a system using it will remain stable long term, not moving up or down.

"My understanding of this memo:

Exchanges in Canada are getting around Canadian securities legislation by claiming that assets like Bitcoin are not securities. However, the Canadian regulatory agency is now stating that this is not true, because the exchanges are not actually giving the assets to the users' accounts- they are merely promising to credit the user when they go to withdraw or sell for fiat. None of those transactions are on-chain, and the users do not actually control any of those coins. This is how exchanges like Quadriga and MtGox screwed so many users who ""owned"" a lot of cryptocurrency, but never actually got it once the exchange got hacked/exit scammed/[XYZ reason here].

Therefore, the agency is saying, the exchanges can either give actual credit of these coins to the users for the currencies they are entitled to, as in, on-chain transactions and control of the private keys (unless I'm missing something, correct me if I'm wrong) or they can be subject to securities legislation.

There is no way Bitcoin or most currencies can handle on-chain capacity in a world where even a small percentage of exchange transactions had to happen on-chain.

Edit: And even if they could, it would alter trading completely, because blocktimes take a while to settle, and 0-conf is not safe enough, even on BCH, to be used consistently for large amounts. BTC wouldn't even be in the picture, because the blocksize is so small and LN is such an impractical unfinished clusterfuck.

If cryptocurrency ends up being regulated as securities, how would that affect things? All exchanges that serve Canadian customers would have to change their rules for those customers. More importantly, more countries could, and I think very likely, some would, follow.

Any other insights would be appreciated.

**Edit 2:** Guys, it couldn't be any clearer:

People trading aren't using any keys. They're trading IOUs for a portion of the exchange's wallet(s). Withdrawals come from the exchange's hot wallet.

"threshold signatures are not BSV exclusive. But nChain's patent allows multi parties to have signing authority for your finds and N of M signatories in an application.

eg. when you have deposits on the exchange you have control of the keys the exchange can't touch them, however, when a mutual exchange occurs in a trade a signature is generated that allows funds to move.

The concept sounds too good to be true, so I won't believe it until it's implemented. But if someone has designed the tools to do that all teh power the inventors. they are going to take crypto mainstream and make it secure.

It won't be the first time a patent is awarded to an imposable technology however one has been issued and this law looks like it is designed to make exchanges use it.

Downvoting me does not change the playing field, it's akin to shooting the messenger. 

nChains patents are all free on BSV, however, you don't need them to use bitcoin.

My take on patents as an anarchist is they are immoral, but then again people tend to use any means available to them in war, so why not use your enemy's tools against them. This is a non-violent tool so I'm pro the gorilla warfare that can provoke others to violence in your defence so I guess the adage ""all's fair in love and war"" is still true today. 

I take joy in the irony that the state will be using the law to defend Bitcoin which will ultimately undermine their authority, yes it's poetic justice, the type people who don't look into the distant future tend to down arrow click, and that's OK, if you read this you have an above-average attention span so it probably has value even if you disagree.";-2;1;False;Adrian-X;ff01tn9;"Canada to force exchanges to immediately transfer ""ownership, possession and control"" of crypto assets to users.

It would be safe: Use 2-out-of-3 multisig for the coins. The third keys is held by an independent party contracted by the exchange and the user. Both the exchange and the user can at any point in time request the third key, but once that happens the other party will be notified. Also once that happens the other party isn't able to request the key anymore.

">  If the client has access to the keys and therefore the funds to their crypto then no problem

But that's just it. People **don't** have access to the keys of their coins, on any of the big exchanges. That's not how it works. It's not just fractional reserve ponzi exchanges that will be affected. It will affect all traditional exchanges.

As it stands now, when you deposit cryptocurrency onto an exchange, it goes into a giant wallet of the exchange, one of a select few that they have. No trader has access to the private keys of the coins in their account. When you trade cryptocurrencies, you're not actually trading real cryptocurrency, you're trading an IOU for a portion of the coins in the exchange's wallet. No on-chain transactions happen during trading. If the exchange gets hacked or otherwise loses a portion of the coins in one of their giant wallets, you can be out the money, because the actual currency is gone, and you're just left with an IOU.

So I don't know how an exchange would operate in a way that allowed them to have the same functionality as today, and also allow users to immediately have access to the private keys for every single trade and every single coin they own.

"> The Bitcoin blockchain could grow to a size where it will be unable for the average Joe to host a node. 

Can I let Satoshi explain it for me?

Satoshi: “At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to specialists with server farms of specialized hardware.”   – 2008

Satoshi: “At equilibrium size, many nodes will be server farms with one or two network nodes that feed the rest of the farm over a LAN.” – 2010

Satoshi: “The design supports letting users just be users.  The more burden it is to run a node, the fewer nodes there will be.  Those few nodes will be big server farms.  The rest will be client nodes that only do transactions and don’t generate.” – 2010

https://webonanza.com/2015/10/02/did-satoshi-predict-pooled-mining-big-farms-and-asics/

How can something that goes directly against what Satoshi envisioned claim to be the real Bitcoin? Satoshi (the creator of Bitcoin) never suggested to Joe to run his own node. He suggested exactly the opposite - for Joe to run while it makes sense, then move over and let ""specialized"" ""server farms"" take over.

">So, what exactly do we know now that prevents us from having bigger blocks?

Bigger blocks make validating the concensus rules proportionally more resource intensive. More intense resource requirements would make doing so prohibitively expensive on consumer hardware, leading more and more people to give that up and rely on large central entities to do that validation (and set those rules) for them. With history as a guide, we can predict that if we move far enough in that direction, those entities will make adjustments to the ruleset (or limit my access to it) in a way that benefits them, relative to me, which would destroy most of what makes bitcoin compelling in the first place.

Decentralisation in not an end per se, but the means to the end of censorship resistance. 

How much decentralisation do we need? Just enough to guarantee ccensorship resistance. Any more decentralisation than that is welcome, but not needed (actually useless). 

Not everyone needs to host a node to guarantee this minimum amount of decentralisation.

Will a bigblock chain become too centralised to damage censorship resistance? No. There will always be enough businesses, explorers, academics and hobbyists to alert of something fishy.

 BTC nodes already do that by default (a BTC node will only check recent tx signature data, not the full history)

I would be ok with verifying only the last months worth of blocks and transactions.. who have enough hash power to fake that chain?

However, instead of spending very valuable programming time on 2nd layers, BTC first needs to fix initial sync times if small blockers are completely honest. Ironically, fixing that will also make the block size debate null, they can double or triple it afterwards. On chain UTXO commitments are ignored due to almost ""philosophical"" reasons, as it is claimed that to know that you are on the right chain, according to the people who oppose utxo commitments and checkpointed utxo download and working from there, the only way is to start downloading from the very first block.

A hash to a 10 000 block deep utxo set, with all the pow of 10 000 blocks, is monumentally impossible to fake.

Sure, let business nodes that deal with millions of dollars sync from the beginning just in case, just don't make me download half a terrabyte of data to run a full node for me actually use BTC with a full node. It would be optional, and in the end if SPV is all that bad like they claim, and how running nodes is important, let people run nodes with checkpointed pruned clients.";2;0;False;hesido;feyw1fr;Let's try to steelman BTC's arguments;equbbp;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/equbbp/lets_try_to_steelman_btcs_arguments/

"We already did that, it's why we're not BSV now, it's why we haven't yet changed defaults for the soft cap above 2mb, it's why we acknowledge that the node software needs to be optimised for parallel processing and locking strategies before we increase the limit above where it is now given the actual observed processing capacity of the current node implementations.

The problem with core's arguments was scale, and either the stupidity of the people making them or their cynical exploitation of the stupidity of others in not realising where the actual scale limits of present day technology are. It was never that it really is just magical snap your fingers easy to make everything work at scale with no optimisation whatsoever, or even that at a final limit several orders of magnitude higher than the present ones, a barrier does actually kick in, because as a broadcast blockchain is a shared medium you will always have that limit *somewhere* no matter how optimal the hardware and software are organised to pursue that goal.

It's merely stupid and outright offensive to tell people that limit is approximately equal to a fax machine. It is still unclear if the real reason /u/nullc and co made this argument is because they honestly don't know any better (and fair shrift must be given to this possibility, from what I can tell of the cadre of core zealots, none of them are particularly well versed in massively parallel highly scalable systems, their expertise tends to cluster around cryptography proper instead), or they were actively being exploitative and lying and ignoring widespread and extensive advice from people who did know better for many years instead assuming it was they who were wrong. It is now clear that they weren't wrong at all to anyone who pays the slightest bit of attention to present reality as liquid and lightning collapse in flaming heaps and other chains that increased the block size work just fine, and no personal experience or technical expertise is required to make that observation.

login/creating account works fine, maybe add a question after creating a new account ""Do you want to save your seed?"" and give a file to download which contains the seed + offer to import from file

depositing worked flawlessly, update was fast, nothing to complain about

if i create a token, a message is showed in the top right ""Transaction successful. Click or tap here for more details"" and disappears really fast again, but the form to submit is still there => maybe users didn't get to read the message fast enough and press the submit button again (and create the token twice). My proposal: after creating a token, switch to the portfolio page

It's will either be cheaper, or not. It can't be both. Price is the equilibrium between supply and demand.

Whilst at the same time ignoring the fact that, 1) You cant see private channels, so you don't actually know the overall capacity, 2) cost of a $100 vs $10000 channel is the 'same', so you cant use this metric either to measure size, and finally 3) LNBig is expensive, in some cases charge 8000% more in fees than other nodes, so AGAIN, It's very likely people are routing around LNBig because its CHEAPER.

"Some other huge problems with BTC for people who use it in commerce: it has unreliable uptime / usability.

If mempool fills up for any reason, it can be almost impossible to make transactions despite paying a ton in fees. That also goes for a situation where the user just needs to open or fund a LN channel, so layer 2 is not a solution to small blocks.  This is never going to be feasible as money, either it works close to 100% of the time or people won't trust it.

It's also dangerous to hold your savings in BTC - if there is any problem and a lot of people want to sell, because of small blocks you won't be able to send your BTC to an exchange.

"Excellent point:

When the price of gold rises, it means that any individual amount of physical gold is worth more, which means someone can carry more value now in a smaller physical quantity of gold than before, which means it is actually now cheaper for that person to transport and transact with gold than it was before.

For example, if you have a gold coin worth $1, and the value of that coin rises to $2, you can now carry $1 around in half a coin, or half the weight and physical space it took you when the whole coin was only worth $1. An increase in the price of gold makes using it easier. Nobody wants to carry around a big bag of coins or a bar of gold, but dust or small pieces? No problem.

And since you can carry the same amount of value on your person in a smaller physical quantity of gold, it’s actually easier for you to keep it secure and, indeed, private.

But BTC doesn’t work like this. As demand grows, it becomes more expensive to transact with or to transport from one address to another. If fees rise too high, it means you might need to consolidate coins for them to be practically useable, or move them to exchanges, making your Bitcoin far less secure and private than if you could keep them spread across many addresses in small quantities. In fact, certain smaller quantities of Bitcoin actually become impossible to practically use because the fees involved in transacting are worth more than the amount in Bitcoin with which you want to transact.

So much for BTC as ‘digital gold.’ Gold doesn’t get functionally worse when more people want it, it gets better.

If you want to use a cryptocurrency that works better as digital gold, use big-block Bitcoin.

It costs practically nothing to transport, practically nothing to transact with, practically nothing to divide, and it is much cheaper to secure and keep private because you can keep fractional quantities spread across as many addresses as you want.

And if you think it works now when it has minority market-share, just like gold, it will get even cheaper with economies of scale.";3;0;False;knowbodynows;fex43h7;More on why BTC isn't digital gold;eqrngv;http://breakingsatoshi.com/2020/01/18/more-on-digital-gold/
"Satoshi would appear to disagree.  He constantly compared Bitcoin to gold;

>""In this sense, it's more typical of a precious metal. Instead of the supply changing to keep the value the same, the supply is predetermined and the value changes. As the number of users grows, the value per coin increases. It has the potential for a positive feedback loop; as users increase, the value goes up, which could attract more users to take advantage of the increasing value.""

*~Satoshi Nakamoto (2009)*

>""It's the same situation as gold and gold mining. The marginal cost of gold mining tends to stay near the price of gold. Gold mining is a waste, but that waste is far less than the utility of having gold available as a medium of exchange. I think the case will be the same for Bitcoin. The utility of the exchanges made possible by Bitcoin will far exceed the cost of electricity used. Therefore, not having Bitcoin would be the net waste.""

*~Satoshi Nakamoto (2010)*

And perhaps the most relevant here;

>""As a thought experiment, imagine there was a base metal as scarce as gold but with the following properties: boring grey in colour, not a good conductor of electricity, not particularly strong, but not ductile or easily malleable either, not useful for any practical or ornamental purpose and one special, magical property: can be transported over a communications channel. If it somehow acquired any value at all for whatever reason, then anyone wanting to transfer wealth over a long distance could buy some, transmit it, and have the recipient sell it.""

In the quotes you provided above, notice the references to **utility as a medium of exchange**. 

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) can be both digital cash and digital gold in the long run thanks to its utility as a medium of exchange. 

The BTC fork has limited utility due its limited network capacity. Only a small number of people on the planet can use BTC, and it tends to have high fees and unreliable transactions.

No, because Bitcoin didn’t have any real value when the temporary limit was added, which made attacks extremely cheap. That’s not the case today.

The network currently and has always provided more capacity than the free market demands except for ~8 weeks at the end of 2017. That's 8 weeks out of 11 years of history or just 1.39%.

It was originally posted somewhere else by someone trying to get tips on how to improve the design. The individual claims to be a design student. So, it seems like there are a few possibilities:

1. The person posting it is a scammer, and they are making a scam website.
2. The person posting it is a student, and the fictional business they made for their design project seems legitimate.
3. The person posting it is a student, and the fictional business they made for their design project seems like a scam.

So, the way I see it...

1. If #1 is true, then the community should not help the scammer improve the design of their site. The post should also probably be removed by the mods of that community.
2. If #2 is true, then my instincts are just 100% wrong and I need to go apologize and recalibrate.
3. If #3 is true, then the student needs to make some adjustments to the fictional business and spend a little more time researching before designing.

"Better late than never, one could say.

There are however some problems with that draft.  

1. A protocol spec should tell only what the protocol IS.  It should not say how it is hoped to work, or what what it is hoped to achieve.  For instance, this sentence should not be in the ""Work"" section

> The longest valid chain with the most proof of work is generally considered to be the main chain. 

2. The ""Blockchain Reorganization"" section should say only ""Software that processes the blockchain may occasionally obtain blocks that comprise two or more branches of the blockchain, each branch being a valid blockchain.   To comply with the protocol, the software must accept, as ""the"" blockchain, the branch  with most proof of work, among the valid branches that it knows.""

3. Somewhere it should also say that protocol-compliant software must not accept a block B as fully valid unless it has obtained and validated all the previous blocks of the blockchain up to the parent of B.

4. Also the entire section ""Network-Level Validation Rules"" should not exist.  The ""node rules"" cannot be part of the protocol.  There is no way to verify if a relay node is following them, and no incentives for it to do so.  In fact, users can (actually, should) send transactions directly to miners, and miners can create their own transactions, bypassing the relay nodes.

5. The ""Mining"" section too should not be there, because it does not contain any specs.  

6. Ditto for the ""Peer to Peer Network"" section, because users and miners are not required to use it.  Some of them could set up their own P2P network, or do without it entirely.";2;1;False;jstolfi;fewo2pb;Bitcoin Cash protocol spec;eqjvq1;https://bitcoinprotocol.cash/
"Your point about relaying nodes is amiss.

Mining nodes also relay transactions as part of their functionality.

It is certainly possible to validate that functionality. You do not have to validate other people's software on the network against the spec, you have to validate your own.

Dito for your p2p section.";1;1;False;ILoveBitcoinCash;fexc79e;Bitcoin Cash protocol spec;eqjvq1;https://bitcoinprotocol.cash/
"> Mining nodes also relay transactions as part of their functionality.  It is certainly possible to validate that functionality. 

Suppose that miner A solves and posts a block containing a non-standard transaction, that violates some ""node rule"" R but is otherwise valid.  What should another miner (or user) B do with that block?

If B is supposed to accept the block, then rule R is irrelevant, and there is no way to check whether a relay node is applying it.

If B is supposed to reject that block, then rule R is a block validity rule, and must be part of the block validity rules, not some ""node rules"".

But you don't want to do the latter, because then relaxing rule R would be a hard-fork type of change.

For example, the BTC script language has several opcodes reserved for future expansion.  Currently, the validity rules say that they are no-ops.  Thus, when one of those opcodes is redefined to do something non-trivial, scripts that use it as a no-op should fail.  Then the change in the semantics will be a soft-fork type of change.  That is what happened in SegWit: one of the no-ops was changed to mean ""check the sognature in the extension part of the block"".

But the devs did not want people to be using those no-ops wantonly before they were redefined. So they decided that the *relay nodes* should block those transactions.  But they could not tell *miners* and *users* to reject them, because then chenges like SegWit would become hard forks.

> You do not have to validate other people's software on the network against the spec, you have to validate your own

The purpose of the spec its to say what you should do to get your transactions accepted **by the miners and other users**, and how to recognize ""the"" blockchain that **other nodes** give you when you try to sync it (including what to do when those nodes give you two or more branches of it0.  So it  is about how the software run by **other people** is supposed to behave in order to comply with the protocol.  THEN you will be able to choose or program **your** software, based on your goals and on the assumption that a majority of the miners and users will behave according to the spec.

You don't need to comply with the ""Network-Level Validation Rules"" to get your transactions accepted, because miners and other users cannot reject transactions that violate those rules (see above).   And you don't need to use the P2P network either, and you cannot check whether a transaction in the blockchain used it or not.";1;0;False;jstolfi;fextwx4;Bitcoin Cash protocol spec;eqjvq1;https://bitcoinprotocol.cash/

"To simplify things for everyone involved I suggest that you simply buy a ""Blue Yeti"" microphone to everyone who participates in the developer meetings.

I bought one back in 2010 and it still works extremely well 10 years later. Here's a review of the microphone made by the well known youtuber ""MKBHD"" back in late 2015:

(Start looking at 59 seconds in the video.)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9E006QLHt0Y&feature=youtu.be&t=59

I searched for ""Blue Yeti"" on Amazon and it's still manufactured and sold today. Maybe you or someone can use purse.io to buy each Blue Yeti with BCH and the purse.io discount. It's sent directly from Amazon so I guess it can be sent to almost any country in the world in a few simple clicks.

https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Yeti-USB-Microphone-Blackout/dp/B00N1YPXW2/

It costs about 100 USD at the first link I found on Amazon. Maybe you can find them even cheaper if you search on Amazon for a few minutes.

Whenever you learn that someone is going to participate in the next developer meeting you (or someone) can simply ask them what address they live at, and then buy and send them a Blue Yeti microphone via Amazon and purse.io. 

If they're important enough to be invited to participate in a developer meeting then they're important enough to get a free Blue Yeti so their sound quality becomes excellent. It would be a great first step and any internet bandwidth connection issues could be solved separately on a case by case basis.

I know the Blue Yeti is a physically big microphone but it's compact for it's great sound quality. There's simply no way around it. If you want great sound quality then you have to sacrifice a bit of desk space. It's not as pretty and portable as using e.g. Apple AirPods but it's easily worth it anyway if you're recording audio for a video as you do in your case.";2;0;False;todu;fey325f;#BitcoinCash developers continue to focus on the future.

">UNPREDICTABLE fees are a big problem for the LN. Note that each transaction that is exchanged in a channel payment must include sufficient fee to be processed by the miners when the channel is closed, at some indeterminate future date.

Unpredictable fees are not a ""big problem"", if the fee moves to $5 for a couple of days this isnt a problem, it's an inconvenience. HIGH fees are a ""problem"" but not for the reasons you are arguing about, the problem is the barrier to entry. just as a quick history lesson, when the bitcoin fees where $50, each transaction had an average of $812,000 being moved, and this was across the entire 300k daily transactions. If the fees where going to be $50 and sustained again for any meaningful amount of time, then then cost per coin would be 200k and value moved needs to be closer to $1m per transaction. Given that Bitcoin is ""crippled"" it sounds like both can't happen...

>Week-long confirmation delays are another big problem, because in case of fraudulent closure the punishing transaction may not be confirmed in time.

This is a potential problem if the channels are not managed, you have already indicated that fees are already reserved so providing a channel is not entirely weighted against you for weeks/months before any BIG fee event then this is a none issue. The person committing fraud loses whatever balance they have on their side and the transaction fee which is reserved against the rolling 'actuals'.

I really don't get what you are trying to say here. The usefulness of a payment channel in a high fee envrionment is the ability to continue to make transactions and payments to other individuals within the network WITHOUT needing to touch the high fee base layer, without requiring trust. payment channels are not ""consumed"" like fuel, the balance is simply shifted....

Another analogy for you, What is also unpredictable? - The weather... does that mean because snow is unpredictable that because a place may see snow its somehow undesirable? Or what about flooding... Venice flooded again only a few weeks ago... does that may Venice undesirable and a terrible place to visit/live??   Of course not, when considering where to visit/live you consider ALL factors rather than just a single element. Bitcoin may have more difficulties with fees - which is EXACTLY why people like you reduce all the conversations around Bitcoin down to fees, and exactly why BCH is 'supposed' to be better. Fact is though, people can see through it, just because the fees are less predictable, doesn't make it any less desirable.";-2;1;False;Dugg;fexb6oi;Blockstream's attacks on Lightning and Ethereum has following meaning: Blockstream investors are done with pumping money into BS.

Do a CTRL-F and see how many time Bitcoin comes up in the results... Also see how many times Blockchain comes up.

The context of these results are important. 

We are developing Lightning: an open protocol layer that leverages the power of **blockchains** and smart contracts to make cheap, fast, private transactions available to anyone around the world.

Our implementation, lnd, has been primarily developed for Bitcoin, and we have also integrated Litecoin support.

So if you read whats going on, Lightning is blockchain agnostic, and LND an implimentation of Lightning is for Bitcoin based blockchains Bitcoin/Litecoin.

>And they never admitted that BTC would NOT be suitable for the LN, because of the recurring backlogs and unpredictable fees -- did they?

This has little context. LN is about trading off elements of base layer for faster and more private transaction. Without going into the whole fee debate that goes nowhere around these parts, again look at the tradeoffs.

"> Unpredictable fees are not a ""big problem"", if the fee moves to $5 for a couple of days this isnt a problem, it's an inconvenience.

Satoshi expected that the cost of processing a transaction, and hence the fee, would actually decrease with time.  The miners' fee revenue was supposed to increase thanks to increased traffic, not increased per-transaction fee.

In Greg's redesign of the bitcoin protocol, the fee *per transaction* is supposed to increase as users would need to pay more in order to get into a block.  If Alice sends Bob a transaction with a $0.50 fee, and the minimum fee for confirmation increases from $0.10 to $1.00, Bob would need to use CPFP (and hence lose money) in order to close the channel

In reality, Greg's dream is not going to happen.  Instead, the mempool size and fees will vary chaotically.  If the fee rises to $20 for six weeks (as it happened twice since 2016), the problem above will exist even if Bob demands that Alice include a $5 fee in the LN transactions, for good measure.

But you are right that HIGH fees too will be a problem for the LN, even if they are constant or fully predictable.  Each LN channel requires that the parties pay at least two tx fees.  If the fee is $50 (as predicted/hoped by some BTC gurus), then merely opening an LN channel will cost $100.  How much do you pay to get a credit card, or a bank account?

> I really don't get what you are trying to say here. 

Crypto users who may consider using the LN will have to choose between the BTC version of the LN (the cognac-buring Nescius) or a version based on any other coin, like BCH or ETH (the gasoline-burning Nescius).  You say that the first one is better because the uses can save the $50 fee from most transactions, whereas with the second choice they would only save the $0.50 fee on most transactions...

They implemented a dual-headed strategy; surrender on the produce according to the conditions of the attack chain, but also mint and continue a new chain according to the original specifications of the project with the same intentions going forward, loudly announce this is what you're doing, and announce that your mining of the sabotaged chain is purely for short term profit and that you don't actually accept that it has value.

I don't hold any BTC because I think that blockchain has no long-term potential, but I try remain open to the possibility that I'm wrong and that I have to re-adjust my investment thesis at all times.
