Never really heard that, I'm 4 years, other much much longer than that. I do also keep my brokerage with them so they aren't feeling too used and I only take out the max amount. They literally end up crediting 20-100 bucks every month. Fidelity and StateFarm also have the same deal and the exact same amazing rates (tried them all at the same time).

It’s really all about who the enemy is and what they’re doing. People don’t understand the egregiously sneaky and underhanded means that Jews resorted to in undermining the German nation and culture. 

The propaganda myth that Hitler simply hypnotized a whole nation with baseless lies about Jews is laughable. Would Americans want to expel all Catholics for zero reason?  No. There was a reason.

"Yet another example of Core's lack of understanding of basic economics:

>[Freicoin] is an alt chain with the design goal that holders of the coin will have negative interest rates, as a means to increase the velocity of money by reducing the incentive to save. Fees are taken for holding coins and distributed to miners.

>The design of Freicoin specifies that during the initial money creation period (approximately 3 years), 80% of the generated Freicoins are to be distributed by the Freicoin Foundation via donations and only 20% are awarded to miners. This differs significantly from Bitcoin, in which 100% of issued Bitcoins are awarded to miners.

"Segwit can segregate witness data and people won't need to download it 'if they don't want to verify the chain'. So, if people are not validating their own data then how do they know a bad actor isn't manipulating the blockchain and inserting invalid transactions?

This is a pretty powerful tool for some hackers, much smarter than me, to manipulate to try and pull off some heists.

The whole point of the blockchain is to not need to trust a third party. Why do you think this is worth the minimal improvements in fixing transaction id malleability which is not an issue as long as you don't track transactions simply by their ID (which was shown to be a bad idea in 2014).

But core is connected to Blockstream AXA who are connected to the big banks.

So let's put two and two together.

Big banks want...

Bitcoin to establish Segwit where people 'trust' third parties to validate transactions for them to 'save bandwidth'. 

Bitcoin to be too expensive to spend 'on chain' (settlement layer lol) so you are forced to....use lightning networks run by centralized banks who have absolute control over any transactions that go through it...

Do you think bankers want a decentralized system of money that has a limited number of coins and all transactions can be publicly accounted for? 

Or do you think the miners are just super greedy and they want to get rich off doing exactly what Bitcoin designed them to do? 

Also, whenever anyone had an idea that diverged with Bitcoin's original strategy they were forced to create a new coin. 

But core/AXA decided to abolish the white paper and change Bitcoin into a very very VERY different coin with a VERY different function, and got away with it by censorship and propaganda.

"The Bitcoin whitepaper defines Bitcoin as a chain of digital signatures.

"In September 2015 (yes it's been going on that long), the head moderator of r/bitcoin put a sticky saying he was going to censor all posts that disagree with him on the direction of Bitcoin development. The censorship there is not a secret or conspiracy, he explicitly said it's his policy. He famously said that even if 90% of all users disagreed with him, he'd still do it.

At the time r/bitcoin was the only bitcoin subreddit and arguably the most important communication channel for the community. There was a huge backlash among engaged users and r/btc was eventually born, but most casual or new users have no idea what's going on.

For more than 2 years now r/bitcoin has been a highly censored propaganda machine for one narrow view and is not at all representative of the community at large.

This not only split the community, sowed distrust and bad blood, it also continues to mislead the massive influx of new users who have no idea that r/bitcoin is a propaganda machine and who just take it all at face value.

Part of the reason bitcoin has precipitously lost market share in the cryptocurrency space this year is because of these kinds of bad actors in the bitcoin space.

"Thanks. Personally, I am a Bitcoin guy. I think Bitcoin will be the dominant cryptocurrency for the years to come. What it will be used for doesn't really matter in the short term - it needs to get its hooks in and grab the financial world by its balls for it to succeed as a store of value and global payment mechanism.

Our company www.sci.ph is different, though. We now support only Bitcoin, but will soon support Ether, LTC, XRP, and even allow our BTC holders to access their Bitcoin Cash. Our business aims to be as agnostic as possible. We wont discriminate and will provide services based on demand. We are using cryptocurrencies primarily as a transfer mechanism, so Bitcoin at $200 and Bitcoin at $8000 is the same thing for us. We use it to settle our business transactions, and end users don't even need to understand it.

I actually know some people from the Core team and they are the most competent group of people in the crypt industry hands down. I believe that 18 months is not a long time for this kind of undertaking - you cannot rush this. We have built simple apps for our services and those things take months and months to test, and are still a work in progress. Imagine Bitcoin, where $120B in value relies on your code to be bulletproof? The recent incompetence shown by Segwit2x and the untested nature of the BCash software and development team does not exactly inspire confidence.

Honestly, I'm sick and tired of the lies and misinformation the Core team has spread and the manipulation their trolls believe.

"No it doesn't, it's clogged up, the blocks are full and the fees are far too high and it will get worse.

LN is based on taking transactions off chain, but to make sure your coins aren't stolen you still have to be able to make on-chain transactions. If Bitcoin continues to grow these kind of transactions will get far too expensive for an individual to pay.

For example: Someone steals 10$ from you, you want to get your coins back but the fee is 20$ for an on-chain transaction (That also has to clear in 24 hours or you lose your claim!). You either waste money or you can't do anything but take the loss.

Now imagine if Bitcoin use goes through the roof, LN is still based on the blockchain, so fees may get extremely high, think 100-1000$ per on-chain transaction, which only companies and large LN hubs can afford. We're back to a system similar to current banks.

This whole system is doomed.

For LN to work (Without fucking everyone over) you still need cheap on-chain transactions :-/";4;1;False;Vlyn;dq3hrcs;r/bitcoin 299 days ago;7e8ke5;https://i.imgur.com/QYrtkjZ.jpg

"Ok, so. Im not part of either Bitcoin community but I understand how bitcoins block chain works (though I don't understand the deferred ledger thing that caused the fork)

But it seems to me that bitcoins protocol as it's designed could not support the world's transactions. The blockchain is already large and that is from relatively niche use. If it was used for mainstream transactions and the protocol modified so it had enough bandwidth for said transactions. The blockchain would get fuuuuuck off huge. And it would grow every day.

It would hardly be egalitarian if mining required multi millions in investment to get into it. While I think /r/Bitcoin going full censorship is pathetic and dishonest, I agree with them in that small time transactions just can't really be the future, can it?

One other thing I'd mention is that visa costs an average of 2.10 per transaction, and cash through logistical overhead costs vendors 0.30.

"> It seems to me that people conflate two very different forms of price deflation: debt deflation (less money chasing the same amount of goods) and deflation caused by economic growth (the same amount of money chasing more goods). The latter, by definition, isn't terrible for economies.

You can measure monetary deflation separately from price deflation. I've never seen a case where significant contraction in the supply of money didn't cause a recession. In either case price deflation also seems to be pretty bad for economies (or bad economies lead to price deflation).

The most successful economies in the world tend to have a moderate amount of inflation. Japan is notable as one of the only nations with consistent deflation and their economic growth has been stagnant for nearly 30 years, in fact their GDP per capita is lower than it was 30 years ago.

>By this logic, you don't have any incentive to spend your inflationary currency on anything other than buying the deflationary currency.

How is that the logic?

People already have inflationary currency and access to deflationary assets, we don't have to speculate on what they would do with it. The whole point is that saving and spending are two different things. Money doesn't need to be a good ""store of value"" because money has no value except for helping exchange value. Money under a matress for 20 years is not generating value regardless of whether the money supply is inflating or deflating.

People use money for consumption, not savings. When people want to save they use money to buy things that appreciate like property or stocks.

A currency that people don't want to spend and just hoard isn't a good currency, its a deflationary asset, of which there are already many that have lots of other uses.

There is a strange, unexamined circular logic behind bitcoin proponents that says all the problems with bitcoins adoption as a functional currency because it was never intended to be a currency and its narrow minded to think that's all bitcoin can be. Then when asked to justify why its actually valuable, and why what we're seeing isn't just a spiral of speculators looking to profit from increasing price rises caused by , then it suddenly becomes a currency again, even though all the arguments for why bitcoin isn't a good currency were dismissed with ""well yeah its not meant to be a currency"".

>It seems to me that the idea that Bitcoin should be a currency today is the error. Currency requires currentness. Currentness requires that it be generally accepted. It is way, way too early to expect that. Great (now-4-year-old) comment expanding on this point here

That argument doesn't address the points I'm making about why inflationary currencies displace deflationary ones. It simply asserts that we don't have to worry about bitcoin not being a currency now because it will be a currency in future, and that somehow with enough speculation it will somehow transform into a functional currency, and that all its value is coming from unrealized future value as a currency, not simply speculation on a deflationary asset.

It does no work to prove this, and the 5 supposed ""pre-requisites"" that bitcoin will need to become a useful currency all apply to previous speculative bubbles in deflationary assets that never turned into a currency. Deflationary assets don't turn into currencies just because they hit a certain market cap.

"> You can have inflation of the supply without moving around relative value. For example like with a stock split. If everyones shares are split in two, everyone still owns the same amount of value its just diluted into a larger number of shares.

Theoretically, sure, you could imagine increasing the nominal supply of money in such a way that the newly-created money is distributed to existing holders in exact proportion to their current holdings.  Basically, have everyone take out all the paper currency they have and, at the exact same moment, add a '0' on the end -- so a $1 bill would become a $10, and a $5 would become a $50, etc.  And similarly, everyone's bank account balances would get multiplied by ten. If this plan were announced way in advance such that all contracts could take its effects into account when they were being drafted, then you could have nominal price inflation without affecting anyone's purchasing power.  But that's obviously not how new money is created and distributed in the real world.  https://wiki.mises.org/wiki/Richard_Cantillon#Cantillon_effects

>aside from ignoring the real world evidence that monetary deflation is terrible for economies

It seems to me that people conflate two very different forms of price deflation: debt deflation (less money chasing the same amount of goods) and deflation caused by economic growth (the same amount of money chasing more goods). The latter, by definition, isn't terrible for economies.  

>and the very immediate evidence that deflation is killing bitcoins use as currency

I don't see that at all. It seems to me that the idea that Bitcoin should be a currency today is the error. Currency requires currentness.  Currentness requires that it be generally accepted. It is way, way too early to expect that.  Great (now-4-year-old) comment expanding on this point [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1mb27q/bitcoins_vast_overvaluation_appears_caused_by/cc7i6y8/)

>If you have access to both deflationary and inflationary currency you never have any incentive to spend deflationary currency over the inflationary one.

By this logic, you don't have any incentive to spend your inflationary currency on anything other than buying the deflationary currency.  

>This is why we don't have any deflationary currencies anymore. It's why the entire world got off the gold standard. 

I don't think so. It seems to me that gold's fatal flaw as a currency was its high transactional friction which necessitated reliance on ""second-layer solutions"" aka banking. The gold *standard* failed because the temptation of a central backer to issue more IOUs than they had gold to back it up is always going to prove irresistible, leading inevitably to default.

>All the pro-deflationist arguments still apply to gold but gold will never be a currency again because no one wants to spend it when you can spend other things that don't increase in value.

No, gold will never be a currency again because of its massive transactional inefficiency.

>Currency doesn't need to be a store of value. 

I disagree.  I think that historically currencies could get away with being relatively poor stores of value because they didn't face competition from something like crypto. But that's obviously changed.

"You said supporting Bitcoin Cash ""exclusively"". Do you know what that word means? Here's a definition for you: ""to the exclusion of others; only"". The majority of your site supports both Bitcoin and to a lesser extent Bitcoin Cash. It's a confusing mess. Why are you so hesitant to focus *exclusively* on Bitcoin Cash? When I go on bitcoincash.org, it doesn't present me with Bitcoin Core or information about Bitcoin, it focuses only on Bitcoin Cash because it's a true Bitcoin Cash website. 

Until bitcoin.com exclusively focuses on Bitcoin Cash, then you haven't done shit or honoured your promise. You can't continue to support both.

I appreciate the work you have done for cryptocurrencies in the past but I'm not a fan of your recent politics. Please stop promoting messages based on hate. Please promote the positives of Bitcoin Cash and leave Bitcoin Core out of it. Let time speak for itself.
