If you think about it Cash is a problem for a number of countries. Cash really facilitates anonymity, it facilitate illegal activity, it facilitates tax avoidance...and a range of other things that aren't going to drive efficiency in an economy. Trust is a critical component of any payment system. So if you think about the idea that all of a sudden your having cryptocurrencies being ""manufactured"" if you like on an anonymous computer in an anonymous location, it's completely legitimate to have some concerns about how that might be working. What a regulator wants to do is ensure there is a fully compliant root to the transaction, that they understand who is making the transaction, who the payment is being made to and that they have a suitable record so they can ensure there is credential control over the system. **If it's an anonymous transaction, that sounds like a suspicious transaction.

I don't think that's true at all.

Often exposés serve as a wake-up call for the public, to ""expose"" a problem to the public that needs more attention. 

To wait around till the story ends before writing about it negates the whole purpose of investigative journalism.

A recent example was the piece written by The New York Times on Harvey Weinstein. If they had waited till he was caught to write the article, he'd still be out there and that article would probably never get written.

And an exposé on Blockstream is 100x more relevant to the average American than anything about Harvey Weinstein, considering how many non-investors are now investing in Bitcoin without knowing anything about it.

"Yea.. you admit yourself that it's backwards compatible, but you bury it deep enough that it's confusing yourself: A legacy node would not relay the blocks if it was deemed invalid. A SegWit txs is understood and accepted as a valid txs on the legacy network, period. This is not something for debate, it's a fact. Plenty of legacy nodes out there that attest to that.


You can phrase everything in highly conspiratorial terms, like ""51% attack""... or you can accept that the majority of users wanted SegWit. Those who did not, went their own way. This is again fact - The majority of users wanted SegWit activated. After you accept this fact, which might be difficult, I'm sure you'll argue that we are all brainwashed by Blockstream for wanting off-chain scaling and to keep the blocks as small as possible. Alternatively, you could much more simply accept that you are part of a minority who disagrees. And whether that's because you can truly see things more clearly, it's all still very experimental at this point so perhaps you do, or simply because you like to play contrarian is completely irrelevant. Big blocks are the minority, end of story.

Just like the majority of voters wanted Trump, not my personal preference but I accept it, I think it'd be great if you could just accept what the majority wanted and do your own thing. The good thing about blockchains is that you can fork and go your own way. Not so easy in politics/countries.

"Some generators haven't been updated to specify Bitcoin Cash in the QR code, they still just say ""bitcoin:"".

Can you link me to the QR code you had a problem with? I got a general purpose barcode reader on my phone I can use to see what exactly the code says.";1;1;False;TiagoTiagoT;dqmsq14;Cryptonator just decided to rename Bitcoin Cash to Bcash.
