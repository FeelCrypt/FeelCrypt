"I’m the delusional one? Sure, you could do the same type of off chain tipping with regular bitcoin, the difference is that you could never transfer your tips to your own wallet because of the fees. I mean even if I collected $10 in tips I wouldn’t actually get to spend any of that bitcoin....

I have posted a lot in both the bitcoin and btc subreddit. I have received a lot of tips of bitcoin cash but I never even really seen bitcoin tips happen for anyone, and it’s obvious why...

Tips in regular bitcoin would just be a reminder of how it’s failing as a currency. No one tips “a store of value”";1;1;False;SuperSonic6;drqn3sk;This Guy Is Going Around Reddit Giving People Gifts of BCH Can We Get An Appreciation Post For Him?;7lybxy;https://i.redd.it/awfkoed0ky501.jpg

"I would almost take offense to that, but it is great to be needed, just the same!  Who doesn't want Santa as a hero?  Really?  He can have better gadgets than James Bond (he has an entire workforce of elves, after all, that can make anything).  He can get anywhere in an instant (just like Bitcoin Cash).  And he knows if people are naughty or nice, so it takes the guesswork out of it.

So, personally, I think I would make an incredible hero.  Except when I need a nap.

"Yes, they've killed off so many incredible uses for Bitcoin by creating the fee market and limited space.  Just incredible how they have hurt this space. An effort like this helps to make people aware of Bitcoin Cash, and that it is not the same as Bitcoin.  And that Bitcoin Cash has uses and capabilities most people were not aware of.

If we can make this distinction clearer for normal people (not into crypto), then if Bitcoin eventually crashes, it won't take everyone else down with it.

"I can tell you for certain that it *is* making a difference!  Many people here and in the other forums have heard about Bitcoin Cash, but never thought they would own some.  

Then when they hear the intent of the project is to help those who earn only $2 a day, it brings out the Christmas spirit.  

I've only had a few people indicate they don't like BCH, but they get a tip anyway (until we can get tippr to send lumps of coal).  They can't do this.  We can.  We will continue to be able to.

"Santa had a little Bitcoin that rose in value, and it just seems important right now to get Bitcoin Cash into people's hands.  Everyone has been hearing about Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, and now that they have a little, they have more reason to learn more about it.

Merry Christmas! u/tippr $5";2;2;False;bchsanta;drr0oep;This Guy Is Going Around Reddit Giving People Gifts of BCH Can We Get An Appreciation Post For Him?;7lybxy;https://i.redd.it/awfkoed0ky501.jpg

"It takes much practice to be able to boil it down without getting too technical.  

Santa admires Andreas for his skills at making complex ideas understandable.  Bitcoin Cash also has Roger Ver, who is great at explaining the reasons why Bitcoin Cash has such enthusiasm: We are trying to allow every one of every income level to secure their money.  Both of them are very good at what they do.  Santa is glad they can speak well.

Start with a high level overview to get them using a wallet, sending Bitcoin Cash back and forth to each other.  That is fun and gives them initial skills. 
 When they get a glazed look, just leave it alone for awhile.  They'll approach you with questions when they are ready.  If they don't ask for a week, then invite their questions.  If they went right to the glazed look, don't worry.  Gice them a break and allow yourself to start over.  The concepts often need repeated a few times.  Get them just to what they need, without diving into the details.  It's hard to do!

I love your enthusiasm!  It is exciting to see it returning to Bitcoin in the form of Bitcoin Cash.  Keep up the good work.  

Merry Christmas!";1;0;False;bchsanta;drqyftv;This Guy Is Going Around Reddit Giving People Gifts of BCH Can We Get An Appreciation Post For Him?;7lybxy;https://i.redd.it/awfkoed0ky501.jpg

"This Santa hasn't been able to keep track, as kind people have been tipping me, too!  It has been an absolute blast to be able to make so many people happy.  It's $5, not a huge amount, but enough to be meaningful.  Many tell me this is their first crypto, and they never thought they could/would ever get some.  Now they are interested in Bitcoin Cash and have a reason to learn more.

The goal is to let everyone on the globe, even those earning just $2 each day, control their own money and to be able to transact outside their village.  Several years ago, the mPesa system in Kenya handled 43% of the country's GDP.  Over little flip-phones!  If they can do that in Kenya, Bitcoin Cash is possible, too. There is a service, bitPesa, I believe, that lets people buy mPesa with crypto!

"As someone just starting out in crypto, of course I joined r/bitcoin. I quickly found out that it wasn’t a place for advice or a place to learn from until I saw a post that referenced r/btc.
This subreddit opened my eyes and explained the problems I was seeing with bitcoin and introduced me to other cryptos, in particular bch.
Seeing wonderful people like this trying to create a sense of community with a wonderful altruistic spirit especially at this time of year is a joy to behold. One day I hope to be able to return the favour of all the help and advice that I’ve read and do something similar, rather then just press the orange up arrow.

"**TO ALL:  MERRY CHRISTMAS TO ALL!  IT'S BEEN FUN HEARING FROM SO MANY PEOPLE!**

You've given or received Bitcoin Cash tonight.  You can do with it whatever you like.  If you hold onto it, or tip it to others, or even convert it to fiat or another cryptocurrency... it is yours.  It is a gift from Santa.  

You have the opportunity, even though it is just a small amount, to do something fun with this cryptocurrency.  The r/btc community is very welcoming to those with the curiosity to ask questions.  Sometimes we hear the same questions many times a day, so please try to search for an answer before asking.

You can read the [whitepaper that started the Bitcoin phenomenon](https://bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf). It is only a few pages, and only a small portion of it gets into crazy math stuff, but the rest is very easy to read and it will give you a great understanding of the goals of the Bitcoin Cash project.
  
The goal of Bitcoin Cash is to give everyone on the planet the capability to secure their own funds, and to transact with whomever they want, whenever they want, and wherever they may be.  The technology to let this happen is here.  Now it is up to each of us to urge merchants to accept Bitcoin Cash, to use crypto if the merchant accepts it.

We're tired of credit card breaches.  We're tired of identify fraud.  There is a long list of other features we can get by using cryptocurrencies.  We've got the technology, it is just a matter of letting people learn about the future.

Thanks for coming here to thank/beg/plead.  I am sorry I can't Bitcoin Cash into everyone's hands.  But this has been an incredible start.  This Christmas, on Reddit, I've sent tips to Norway, Austria, Australia, Japan, China, and the tips have ended up in other countries I will never know.  This is a global project for everyone.  

**This technology is an incredible gift.  And Christmas is all about sharing gifts.  Thanks for letting me share my passion with you.  Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!**

P.S.  Some of the payments didn't make it through (Santa forgot to restock) so several tips (about 20) did not get delivered.  I will try to identify these and fix them over the next few days.  Sorry for the inconvenience!";29;7;False;bchsanta;drqh57s;This Guy Is Going Around Reddit Giving People Gifts of BCH Can We Get An Appreciation Post For Him?;7lybxy;https://i.redd.it/awfkoed0ky501.jpg

Whaaaaat that's great, I wish I had the money to join and help out if it's real, but I still haven't even bought any BCH yet because and only because of funds or any time it's has been below 2,3-2,5 on the really high end dips I would have grabbed some. Another example that crypto is finally making some of the right people on this planet well off enough to make other people happy, if only a small number of the actual top top people on this planet financially did this I wonder what the honest difference across the world would really be. I'm blabbering now....just my Highidea.

Also, is there a wallet I can use with desktop or web and android support/syncing? What do you guys recommend?

Good looking out all around by the santa team. Merry Christmas to all.

P.S. you guys have ignited the christmas spirit in me, so I am spending this free time trying to release some not quite finished small open source projects.

"/r/bitcoin use to have a tippr bot called changetip .. .but this was before bitcoin made some people very wealthy. Some of those people then started to aggressively protect their wealth and some other who had worked out but missed out on that wealth joined in. This lead to bitcoin (and crypto in general) becoming an over-9000-lets-all-get-rich-quick meme.  

And Bitcoin only has a real chance of changing the world (not necessarily for the better) if it becomes a money. And for it to become a money, transactions and tips and buying stuff with it and paying for internet services  for it are essential. And so we tip, one tip at a time. There are no shortcuts when it comes to user adoption, unlike getting-rich-quick where you have cheats like Tether and other fraudulent douchebagery going on. (and that will make many many victims in the near  future).

"Do some research.  Search, read, and ask.  The r/btc forum is very helpful and can discuss everything about either the BTC or BCH flavor of Bitcoin, as they share the same history.  Just different ideas on what it should be: a storage unit, or a cash that you can also store.  Having a use is what gives something value.  If you can't enjoy it, then it might as well be an old toy you've grown tired of, but don't want to throw out for sentimental reasons.

"This is about Christmas, but also about spreading awareness of Bitcoin Cash.  People have been hearing about it, and Bitcoin, in the news lately, but they've never seen it or had any experience with it.  A simple tip is an easy introduction.  Once people own even a small amount, they have incentive to learn about it.  This amount is sufficient to tip others or perhaps the value will grow and they could buy items or services over the internet with it.

Search for information, read what you can, and ask questions!  Most of us are interested in Bitcoin Cash because it plans to be a means of exchange even for people who only earn $2 a day and have no access to banks or merchants they can't walk up to.  This changes everything, and it is secure.

"They say the gift is in the giving.  If this helps Bitcoin Cash gain visibility and attracts people from various subreddits, that will grow support and adoption.

Santa is all about giving, so I just thought this was a great way to promote Bitcoin Cash and have fun at the same time!

"Art has no utility.
Gold, in its majoratively invested form, has no utility. 

The market for gold is $6 trillion+, and still operates as an excellent store of value, despite having no practically used utility. 

I'm not saying you're incorrect in that Bitcoin could follow the paths of Tulips, however, it could also not.

This is how you view Bitcoin's future:

- Bitcoin keeps increasing in value.
- Sudden selling.
- People keep selling.
- It doesn't stop.
- Bitcoin dies.

However, this could happen:

- Bitcoin keeps increasing in value.
- Bitcoin acts as a store of value and is only used for very large purchases (houses, cars, etc.).
- Bitcoin experiences dips and highs.
- Bitcoin plateaus at a market cap, above that of gold, since it's much more transactionable than gold.

"See, you're making up your own argument now - probably to gain some face which you lost when you realised you misunderstood how a store of value works (when you thought a store of value needed to have utility).

I'm not talking about BTC vs BCH. I'm not talking about cryptocurrency. I'm not talking about the feud between the two. I'm correcting you on your initial post:

>How does a store of value even work when there is no utility

As discussed, you were wrong. A store of value doesn't need to have any utility, just consensus (look at gold, art, sea shells, etc.). By the way, I happen to agree with you that BCH is more practical to use than BTC. However, that wasn't what we were discussing.

Just chalk it up to your misunderstanding. It's fine - learn and move on. BTC, at the moment, is a good store of value.

"Oh my god.

The author thinks that all altcoins are forks of bitcoin.  [facepalm]";290;8;False;;drqw22v;"WSJ: ""[bitcoin core] fees have reached an average cost of about $30 per transaction. That makes bitcoin virtually unusable for all but very large transactions. The Bitcoin Cash crowd is just trying to offer a solution to that problem.""";7m2gb8;https://www.wsj.com/articles/bitcoin-cash-litecoin-ether-oh-my-whats-with-all-the-bitcoin-clones-1514037600?reflink=e2twmkts
"> But 100 coins offer that..

Well, the market seems to think otherwise. Why do you think that is? Perhaps you're missing something that ""the mindless people in here"" are not?

> 0 coins offer the store of value BTC does.

""Store of value"" is a myth and joke, with the volatility that BTC is experiencing. Have people who bought bitcoin at 16k, 17k, 18k, or 19k experienced this wonderful ""store of value""? No. 

But now you'll say ""what about the people who bought below 13k? To which my answer is ""they saw a great appreciation in their **investment**. Bitcoin has proven to be a great **investment asset**, but as far as financial instruments go, you [(and the people you get your information from)](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7m1got/not_long_ago_btc_dominance_of_the_total_market/drqu2rm/?context=3) need to understand that they're on the other end of the spectrum from ""reliable store of value instruments"". 

BTC is not a SoV. No cryptocurrency is at this stage, in fact. But when on top of that you add such a massive unreliability so as to become increasingly unusable for most the time at this point, you have an instrument that's approaching 100% of pure speculatory value.

The efficient Market Hypothesis is false; such assets inevitably fall down in value to zero in time. And the champaign-corking people in charge of BTC don't seem like they're about to do anything about BTC's status quo anytime soon.

So for christmas I wish for you to think about the inner consistency of the things you're defending.

"Well sure but if the price drops because it's chronically not usable for anything other than speculation by large institutional investors and HODLers, then eventually even the people storing value in it will get burned and they'll withdraw from the market.

EDIT and to expand segwit apparently can only raise the block size once, to 2 MB, punting the problem just a little down the road, and if Lightning Network is deployed its structure will naturally empower well-connected financial players who will then become structurally embedded in the circulation side of the network. They will be middlemen extracting rents from bitcoin users while hollowing bitcoin of its differentiation from the traditional financial markets.

Not only must it be usable as a means of exchange it must be outside the control of traditional state and big financial interests in order to offer something over and above traditional currencies in order to remain valuable.

Ok the meat of my post:

Bitcoin (Legacy) transactions haven't been as cheap as you claim for the typical user, running typical softwares for a loooong time.  Can you roll your own transaction?  Sure. Can you set your own fee? Sure.  Do we see transactions that are basically free in current blocks?  Sure.  

If you need a transaction to happen in under a day, then we are seeing insanely high fees - for the typical person.  What is insanely high - tens of dollars (currently ~50USD).   You can check this yourself: https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-transactionfees.html

Look.  I eat like crap - but I'm thin.  For every person that this statement is true, there are orders of magnitude more where this statement fails.  Hence why we ask everyone to eat healthy...(Please, eat healthy everyone - its good for you; like low fees.)

Lastly (bringing this back to fees) - high fees are a turn off to a lot of people.  Hell even Cobra is questioning the great path forward.  That says a lot.

Perhaps a bit off-topic, but how are we supposed to distribute cryptos to those whom cannot afford to purchase high-end mining equipment, and then an environment to run that equipment in?  It keeps on getting more and more expensive to procure.  If we are to create a new ecosystem from which we separate ourselves from the current banking system, there needs to be alternatives to only supporting one algorithm and perhaps also increasing the total supply.

"""If the network were to get that big, it would take several years, and by then, sending 2 HD movies over the Internet would probably not seem like a big deal."" - Satoshi

As CPU power increased then the network should scale as users used more send to each other transactions while the miners mined new coins at greater hash rates. Using moores law would dictate that the capacity in the future would allow for greater transactions that are here today. So far the network has worked without a bottleneck - which as occurred at the transaction points like coinbase who don't have the proper systems in place. Send btc to btc via peer to peer is quick but the send to cash is the fixed point where the bottleneck occurs on the exchanges. To build a 9 year old system that can outrun the big boys even years later is a major accomplishment by itself. 6 days to mine the first block. That test was extrapolated and based on the bandwidth available became the data point for the calculations we see today. Then Satoshi took into consideration the future of increased CPU and capacity of the data center and realized the network was scalable - up an down - He seemed to know a bit about bandwidth also and the mention of it as a component in the equation lets us see his ""Pure Genius"" in a multitude of areas.

"Good luck trying to fight government regulations with nodes and miners only in known datacenters.  


I can see it now. USA/EU/China (after ""unbanning"" cryptos) - ""Only transfer of crypto-coins between wallets, belonging to users who have had their identity checked and confirmed by official agents/exchanges shall be allowed"". The Committee goes to Jihan and kindly *asks* him to implememt compliant miner software, then US agents knock on Roger's doors and *ask* him to please implement this change all over Bitcoin.com (including the wallet), they then tell the developer ""team"" (is it more than 1 guy already, I don't follow BCH so closely anymore?) to make all the complementary software compliant. The government agencies do a simple traceroute on the existing nodes, check which ones haven't been ""upgraded"" to comply, phone up the datacenter (probably like Hetzner, OVH Joe's datacenter and Wholesale internet will cover 98% of the hosters) and tell them their customers are breaking the law and to shut them down immediately. 

POOF! No more ""pseudonimity"" in Bitcoin cash. You have fast and cheap payments that are written in the blockchain for eternity and each and everyone of them is completely traceable back to you with the press of a government agent's button. Where's the neutrality of the network? Where's the censorship resistance? Nowhere.. But the payments are fast and cheap and that's what it's all about? Right, guys?

"""Leaving it as last resort"" has in this case meant not doing anything to fix the overfilled blocks for years (except a minor raise by SegWit which is not even near enough or well functioning) and thus crippling it as a currency because this raises fees and transaction times by thousands of percent.

That is making the chain less accessible, ie not open but effectively even closed for a lot of people.

If by ""preserving"" you mean not making any changes to the chain at all, then that would be against the white paper and Satoshis own plans to scale. In the beginning there hadn't even been a limit to how full the blocks could get at all, but this was introduced by Satoshi later as a preventive meassure to stop a potential attack. The plan was thus to make sure the blocks still increased in size, but instead by constantly raising the limit either manually or, as Satoshi himself suggested, automatically in good time before the blocks got anywhere near full.";3;0;False;fruitsofknowledge;drq5j53;Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008: Visa processes 100 million transactions per day.

Payment channel was discussed from day one that’s correct.

FWTW large blocker are not against LN.

We think LN will be great but can’t be used as the only scaling device for Bitcoin.

His paper discribe the fundamentals characteristics of Bitcoin.

It is absolutely a reference.

BTC is simply a departure from that, even small blocker agree.

BCH is an attempt to return to fundamentals, is it not a legitimate claim?

I mean, probably. Smart contracts were a very early idea in bitcoin and that's pretty much what LN is - it's hardly a complex and revolutionary idea.

The first example that pops to my head is digital store fronts where you can add x amount of money and buy things, then cash out the money if you wish show - which is the very same logic that is the lighning network based on.

"Why would you think he would want bitcoin to run in massive data centers? Then it isn't decentralized.

It seems a lot of people are losing the point. If it is centralized it loses what gave it its value. The idea was to give a currency to the masses, that was controlled by the masses.

Anyone could easily run their own node and vote on the future of bitcoin. If the blockchain becomes massive, running a full node will be out of reach for anyone without a server farm. And then it becomes a currency for those who had enough money to build the mining farms and nodes. It becomes centralized and then they get to control bitcoins future. Do you think that is what the goal was?

From the whitepaper

""We started with
the   usual   framework   of   coins   made   from   digital   signatures,   which   provides   strong   control   of
ownership,   but   is   incomplete   without   a   way   to   prevent   double-spending.     To   solve   this,   we
proposed a peer-to-peer network using proof-of-work to record a public history of transactions
that   quickly   becomes   computationally   impractical   for   an   attacker   to   change   if   honest   nodes
control a majority of CPU power.""

It says peer to peer, it says it maintains its integrity by honest nodes controlling the majority of the network. They remain honest by remaining decentralized. Once they are centralized, the nodes are no longer honest. Because the owner could force the nodes to accept forged blocks. And then you are left with a centralized currency open to manipulation just like every other fiat.

So if centralization is okay with what you think bitcoin should be, then what the fuck is the purpose of bitcoin? It is just another currency owned and controlled by the rich.

"I think the big issue among bitcoin supporters from the other side is the misleading arguments made by the likes of Roger Ver himself.  

Take for instance this latest find:  https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7lyoum/heard_some_lies_on_a_live_podcast_from_roger_ver/

>Just clicked on a live broadcast with Roger Ver and Jameson Lopp discussing future of crypto, both of whom I didn't know at the time. I went in blind, which is sometime a benefit.

>Long story short: Ver started falsely quoting Andreas, saying that BTC will crash due to lack of 'scaleability,' which is not what was said at all. I happened to listen to the talk Andrea held where he said there will be a shake out incoming, but it will be due to the mass of ponzi schemes and general bullshitters in the scene, impending lawsuits and people who are sold down the river by these fraudsters. Nowhere did Andreas even remotely mention this 'scaleability' malarkey Ver was spouting.

This is what I mean, it's sad there can't be an honest discussion on these two chains.  It seems the only place it's remotely possible currently is on twitter.  I may not agree with this subreddit currently (I'm open minded) but the hypocrisy here I felt needed to be called out.  

Edit:  Lets be honest here, Andreas obviously supports the lightning network, he spoke of it in numerous video's and envisions micro transactions where you can, for example, pay as you watch youtube video's or movies on netflix.  Radical possibilities that currently aren't possible.  I honestly don't think he minds bitcoin cash, I think he believes it will work itself out and he's not in it for the money or to take any sides, but Roger Ver is out of line for even hinting that Andreas believes bitcoin will crash.

Blockstream crippled Bitcoin BTC with high fees, so that people will have to use the Lightning Network (a Blockstream project) for everyday transactions.

Result:  The Bilderberg Group, the Federal Reserve central bank, MasterCard, and traditional banking sector have taken over Bitcoin BTC, crippled it, to turn it into a currency system that they control & profit from.

Analysis:  Bitcoin BTC has been compromised.  Time to switch to another cryptocurrency.

"The point of view of BCH and satoshi is that there's no spam. All transactions are included in the blockchain because that's the economic freedom this is all about. 

(Except for a brief period at the beginning when the network was so frail it needed a 1MB limit just in case someone would want to scare it to shit, so it was in a way like a baby with diapers and pacifier. But the baby is a grown child now. And at least BCH is at last leaving the diapers and the pacifier behind by increasing the blocksize.)

The decision of not increasing the blocksize is what breaks BTC in many ways, making it extremely vulnerable to normal operations. They are choosing to ignore that, and their only justifications are resorting to extreme paranoia, and shift blame, ridiculous. The only doubt is if they are doing it by interest or by incompetence.

*IF* we believe there can be spam and it can be so 'powerful' against bitcoin, then the technology would not be so great of an idea, not so resilient, not so intelligent, it definitely would not be worth so much, it wouldn't be the *honey badger of money*, and in summary it would be fucking broken, like it is.

Satoshi designed the system taking into account situations like this.

A server farm would only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with that one node.

*""The bandwidth might not be as prohibitive as you think. A typical transaction would be about 400 bytes (ECC is nicely compact). Each transaction has to be broadcast twice, so lets say 1KB per transaction. Visa processed 37 billion transactions in FY2008, or an average of 100 million transactions per day.

That many transactions would take 100GB of bandwidth, or the size of 12 DVD or 2 HD quality movies, or about $18 worth of bandwidth at current prices.*

""If the network were to get that big, it would take several years, and by then, sending 2 HD movies over the Internet would probably not seem like a big deal.""

">The point of view of BCH and satoshi is that there's no spam. All transactions are included in the blockchain because that's the economic freedom this is all about.

Sure. And that's a wreckless view. All it takes is one megarich individual that doesn't like Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash or any simple blockchain storage to fill it up with shitty spam transactions. Being blasé about it opens you up to attacks and ends your currency. Bitcoin is under attack simply because far more people use it than Bitcoin Cash, but make no mistake: Bitcoin Cash is vulnerable to the same attack.

>The decision of not increasing the blocksize is what breaks BTC in many ways

When Bitcoin had a huge blocksize it was more vulnerable to spam storage; when Satoshi reduced the blocksize limit, it was still subject to spam attack, but at least it mitigated the damage of storing so much spam.

>we believe there can be spam and it can be so 'powerful' against bitcoin, then the technology would not be so great of an idea

There is spam but luckily it hasn't broken a currency... yet. For Bitcoin is has become slow and expensive. The exact thing could happen to Bitcoin Cash, and Bitcoin Cash would suffer more because it would store more spam per unit time. Basically blindly talking about blocksize doesn't defend against this attack. We need more intelligent solutions.

I'm sick of answering this stupid question over and over again. Spam only becomes effective when blocks are almost full from true economic tx's, like at 995kB today. This is what we have seen in practice. Spam attacks only regularly started July 2015 when blocks started to be full. This is because attackers don't have to pay anything because the spam rolls off the mempool when it's never confirmed thus costing the attacker NOTHING. If instead the limit was removed, the spam WOULD be processed, the attacker would pay a minfee, and eventuality would go bankrupt if they try to sustain the attack. It would be like trying to fill a bottomless well with pennies. Attackers would hate that uncertainty of cost. Miners in the meantime would be enriched from the failed attacks. ;9;0;False;H0dl;drqnbyu;How the Bilderberg Group, the Federal Reserve central bank, and MasterCard took over Bitcoin BTC.;7m046d;https://imgtc.com/i/6vNVjc9.jpg

https://i.redd.it/kx1dn3yffo101.png

And in print:

[Digital Currency Group](http://dcg.co/who-we-are/) owns (in part) and directs [Blockstream](http://dcg.co/portfolio/) (go to ""B"" and look 13 down). Guess who runs Digital Currency Group:
 
1. Glenn Hutchins: Former Advisor to President Clinton. Hutchins sits on the board of **The Federal Reserve Bank of New York**, where he was reelected as a Class B director for a three-year term ending December 31, 2018.
 
2. Barry Silbert: CEO of Digital Currency Group, (**funded by Mastercard**) who is also an Ex investment Banker at Houlihan Lokey. This is the guy who thought SW2x was a good idea.
 
3. Lawrence H. Summers: ""Board Advisor""
""**Chief Economist at the World Bank from 1991 to 1993**. In 1993, Summers was appointed **Undersecretary for International Affairs of the United States Department of the Treasury under the Clinton Administration**. In 1995, he was promoted to **Deputy Secretary of the Treasury** under his long-time political mentor Robert Rubin. In 1999, he succeeded Rubin as **Secretary of the Treasury**. While working for the Clinton administration Summers played a leading role in the American response to the 1994 economic crisis in Mexico, the 1997 Asian financial crisis, and the Russian financial crisis. He was also **influential in the American advised privatization of the economies of the post-Soviet states [a massive FUD campaign that caused Russian citizens to sell their shares in public companies - these shares were purchased by Oligarch bankers with ties to Western Banks and most Russian people had their national resources stolen from them]**, and in the **deregulation of the U.S financial system, including the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act**.""
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Summers
 
4. Blythe Masters: ""Former executive at JPMorgan Chase.[1] She is currently the CEO of Digital Asset Holdings,[2] a financial technology firm developing distributed ledger technology for wholesale financial services.[3] Masters is **widely credited as the creator of the credit default swap as a financial instrument**. She is also Chairman of the Governing Board of the Linux Foundation’s open source Hyperledger Project, member of the **International Advisory Board of Santander Group**, and **Advisory Board Member of the US Chamber of Digital Commerce**.""
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blythe_Masters
 
DCG is also an investor in BitGo (See ""How it works""). See also: Money map
BitGo aims to become a ""service"" which prevents double spending. I thought Bitcoin had that built in. Well this service is only useful if transactions aren't being confirmed in the blockchain (rather, confirmed in, say, a side-chain, like Lightning--Blockstream's developing technology). Surprise, surprise. SegWit2x would literally take power out of the hands of the miners and gives it to central bankers and MasterCard. Interesting that after the decision to ""suspend"" (does not mean cancel) SegWit2x, Bitcoin gets held hostage by ridiculous transaction times.
 
edit: also worth watching this video from MasterCard before they invested in DCG. Notice this guy is just reading a damn script, too. Smh. Probably doesn't even know what he's saying.

"> Xmr is Bytecoin hijacked via bitcointalk.

XMR is a fork of Bytecoin that had a clearer development path, and what do you know? The market preferred it. This is exactly what we're attempting to do with BCH, in fact; what's with your originalist claim?

>  Xmr doesnt scale and praises L2

XMR has dynamic blocksizes and have explicitly stated that while they're open to L2, they won't be depending on them for their scaling roadmap. In the next HF they'll be releasing a huge-ass on-chain scaling improvement to the protocol, in fact.

> Xmr devs are pro core/segshit

I've explicitly read XMR devs condemn the censorship, and speak about ""not wanting Monero to become like Bitcoin Core"". But since this is your claim, I'll put the burden of proof to source **your** claim first.

"Well, it's christmas and I find you as the interested party wanting me to dig these for you a little bit lazy, with all due respect. Anyway, I pretty much have been doing nothing on reddit other than trying to educate the monero community regarding the fee issue. You can easily in <4 minutes find a lot of info lurking my posts.

I am very tired of this subject, and I am certain a fork will happen since the lead developer/merger/public person of monero is extremely close to blockstream, and behaves like blockstream people too.

By the way, he recently said blockstream guys he knows are nice people and only want bitcoin to succeed a few days ago. [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/7k704x/bitcoin_lightning_network_explained_does_this/drcgvbi/) you can take your own conclusions from there if you have been following the debacle of bitcoin core.

In short, as it's christmas and I am tired of this after months fighting to improve monero and only getting attacked, and you downvoted me even, monero is currently the second most expensive coin per average transaction. Naturally, only behind bitcoin core and its artificial problems. This is not a problem to the large part of the community and developers, so they fail to see/ignore the economic issue, like blockstream on bitcoin core. This happens in part due to the monero's average transaction size being very large since confidential transaction range proof (something needed to verify nobody creates coins out of thin air) but the main problem is that users are not able to freely choose their fee. The blocks are 99% of the time far from full! The argument is that if users were able to choose fees, then their transactions would stand out.

Now you wanna know what really does not add up? 1) ring size is freely able to be chosen (above 5), and this makes a transaction stand out much more easily than fee 2) the fee actually CAN BE CHOSEN, so long as pay more than the minimum 3) fluffypony's wallet site mymonero.com actually makes their transaction stand out since **only** they charge 0.02/0.026 fees instead of the low priority 0.0033 and standard 0.012 everyone has to choose. Monero can scale on chain. Monero should be able to embrace any technology that makes it scale better, as long as it does not force users to transact only on sidechains. This is exactly what is happening to bitcoin core and why bitcoincash had to appear. This is exactly what is going to happen to monero.

I find it extremely hypocritical of fluffypony when he says ""he doesn't like things being pushed forcibly to him"" but he's trying to push LN to us. [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/7k704x/bitcoin_lightning_network_explained_does_this/drcgvbi/) notice how on that very same post he says 2x was a stupid idea, so yeah we had to await for LN to fix the issue no matter how many years it is going to take without simply fixing it instantly by doubling the blocksize **while LN isn't available**

The **only** thing that appeared now (ironically proposed by blockstream and other cryptographers I have to be honest) is the bulletproof protocol that will make transaction size reduce by 80%, but you know what? I can bet the transaction fee will not reduce by 80%. Instead they will up the fee per byte to make it up for it. So, even if tx size decreases 82% the fee would for example decrease 30% so that LN (which does not even exist yet) can be kept being pushed on monero.

Now I will be downvoted and attacked after wasting a long time writing all of this, thus the reason I got tired of trying to help. Monero is the best coin and if chooses to walk bitcoin core's path I know it will just eventually be forked anyway.";1;2;False;enceladu;drr3mk4;"The Pirate Bay calls BCH ""BCash"", decides to humiliate BCH users and disallow donations";7m25di;https://thepiratebay.org
