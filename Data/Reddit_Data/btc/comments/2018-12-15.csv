"So, why couldn't he promote LTC, even though he sold it all? Such a dumb attitude. It's not all about pumping the coin you hold. 🙄

Btw, even if he has no LTC, the benefits from LTC becoming successful, because the success of LTC will always be tied to his name and it elevates his reputation, thus he gets more respect and business elsewhere in the ecosystem.";26;2;False;binarygold;ebtkzq6;Tweet of The Year .... 👌;a66z4q;https://i.redd.it/ed5p5fk95a421.jpg

"Fair enough. This sub has its ups and downs. Right now we're picking up the pieces from being attacked by a rouge actor and a bloody fork. Things take time, we only just got some of the tipping bots back online, for example.

And to be fair the whole of crypto is a bloody mess not just bch, compile that with the untimely fork, and trolls/shills trying to further smear BCH while it's weak, it's easy to see why we are here.

But it's temporary, I'm not swayed or fearful in the slightest. BCH still has some of the greatest potential compared to most crypto. The streets are bloody, and I'm buying.";6;2;False;SoulMechanic;ebt56m7;Tweet of The Year .... 👌;a66z4q;https://i.redd.it/ed5p5fk95a421.jpg
