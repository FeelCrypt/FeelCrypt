It's good for Bitcoin (cash) because that is now the only on-chain scaling Bitcoin. Bitcoin Legacy processes around 260ktx/day (and that's all it'll ever do), all cryptospace together processes around 6mtx/day. And it's only going to grow, zero of which is going to go to Bitcoin Legacy.

I'm not a trader, so I'm only interested in sustainable technologies with a clear purpose and strategy for achieving said purpose. I value a slow and steady open development processes with a heavy emphasis on academic research and testing. Monero is by far at the top of this game. The only downside that Monero has, which Bitcoin Cash has is multiple cooperating development teams. I'm uneasy with having only one development team, and only one implementation of the protocol. If Bitcoin Cash can prove to be a reliable source of solid technology, specifically technology for maximizing privacy and fungibility, while doing due diligence in auditing code additions (let's not be like Eth's Parity), then I would probably consider it to be superior to Monero. Until then, Monero it is. ;6;1;False;swinny89;dpjdeiv;segwit2x canceled;https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-segwit2x/2017-November/000685.html

"Well, specifically to your point: 
* Tulips cannot be broken down  
* Tulips are a poor store of wealth, because they rot  
* The rotting also means they are difficult to transport, if not impossible to transport before they lose worth.  
* The government can easily seize the shipment of all tulips.

The value of bitcoin comes from: 
* Bitcoin cannot be seized *easily* by any government. It is, in fact, designed with this scenario in mind. This is just one reason why decentralization is so important.  
* A bitcoin is immutable, it cannot expire, or be faked  
* bitcoin is extremely easy to transport 
* a bitcoin is infinitely divisible. If all but one bitcoin was lost to a paper wallet that got thrown into a fire by accident, a transaction could be generated that destroyed the 1 bitcoin, but created 21 million smaller coins that added up to 1 bitcoin, and the process could continue.

bitcoin's value is *derived* from these properties because of the *fundamental mathematics from which it is built upon*. Because SHA-256 is considered collision free, it allows for the assignment of value to computer processing in a way that does not require trust. I feel like this is a very powerful idea that is just presenting itself to us.

Segwit moves the signatures, it doesn't *remove* them.  It's called ""Segregated Witness"", not ""Eliminated Witness"".

Like, I'm having a hard time even imagining how you think bitcoin would even be functioning today if the signatures were removed.  Bitcoin would be dead.  Everyone's coins would be stolen.  The whole system would no longer work.

"Exactly.

I have an idea how this will continue and it won't be pretty. 

What we will see is just several years of stagnation of the whole crypto space unti:

A.) Lighting Network saves Blockstream's crippled Bitcoin and masses move to using centralized services that legacy banking builds on top of it. (normal users never ever even touch the blockchain as they get outcompeted by these big actors who settle huge sums at time)

B) Some other better performing crypto manages to build the brand recognition that surpasses that of 1MB Bitcoin before Lightning activates. (that could be Monero, BCH or whatever)

Big blockers who rallied against SW2x will slowly realize they were just tools that enabled another victory for Blockstream.

For bitcoin, ""stagnation"" is a feature, not a bug. The inability to change it is what gives people confidence. The confidence that their money won't change at the whim of the latest fashion. That a random developer won't freeze all the funds in their wallets because ""*we has Turing complete scripting language!!!*"". The confidence that even giant business can't take control of bitcoin. That's the kind of confidence that, historically, only gold has had. And it's a difficult confidence to build, but very quick to lose.

"The incentives still work. I'm a big blocker but there is one thing the small blockers have right. Economic nodes trump all. The security of bitcoin is economic, not technical. Mining and hash power properly secure Bitcoin because the COST of electricity can only be spent on one chain or another. The miners only get paid if that chain is considered valid to enough economic nodes who together produce demand for miner effort. If there is sufficient demand, which is impossible to quantify, then there will be exchanges and miners who fulfill it. 

For any upgrade to succeed, whether it's a soft or hard fork, there MUST be **exclusive** support by a strong enough majority of the users themselves that no one sees profit in developing and sinking costs into rejecting it.

Segwit did not have consensus either but because of its construction as a soft fork its opponents had to take action to fulfill the demand for an alternative, and they did. The apparent demand for a non-segwit Bitcoin incentivized a fork to occur. This only occurred once Segwit could no longer be resisted in other ways.

If the dominant economic nodes and by extension their profit motive, based on the market for their services, are such that they cannot support an upgrade exclusively, then there is no consensus regardless of the miner signalling.

There are some videos from talks that explain step by step how this is built, with some Alice sending money to Bob etc. It's super complicated specifically because it had to in order to be trustless.

If you had to trust someone in the network to not take your coins, the whole thing would be pointless. Think about it, in this case why wouldn't we all just use Coinbase accounts instead? Sending Bitcoins via Coinbase requires trust in Coinbase, but it's even faster and simpler than LN, because it's literally just adding/changing some rows in their SQL database.

If you believe in big blocks, very good for you, bet for the big blocks platform and you may win big. If you believe in off-chain scaling, very good for you too and the same applies.

This also brings you the opportunity to hedge your bets holding both in the proportion that is more confortable with your inclination.

"I posted the below  in /r/BitcoinMarkets earlier I figure I may as well post it here. Although I whole heartedly expect to be downvoted by /r/bch for this I'd still like to share my thoughts as someone who did advocate for Segwit2x. 

It's done, it's over with, 2x is dead before it even had a chance to be born and the market has spoken clearly, it's happy with this and that's what matters most. 

It's sad we couldn't of come to agreement over the simplest of changes but we couldn't and no consensus means no change as is the way of Bitcoin and that is what is most important first and foremost. May as well avoid the turmoil in fighting a loosing battle. 

I would of liked to see 2x succeed but I am not sad that it has died. This wasn't about picking a fight, this isn't about ""us vs them"", ""my way or the high way"". This was about putting an option on the table and embracing what Bitcoin is regardless of what constitutes it, embracing consensus not in rejection there of and consensus is blocks at 1 MB in size.

While I'm sad I didn't sell my BT2 futures when I was at an unrealized profit and lost 0.07 BTC on this trade, oh well that's only a small slice of my pie and at least I my investment in an L3+  will pay off and be well worth my wild.

"I’m honestly not even passionate about this bitcoin and bitcoin cash debate.

As a programmer and computer scientist I know that neither coin in its current state will achieve scaling for a global user base. So I truly think there is more of an argument culture going on here just because.

I truly appreciate the idea that increasing the blocksize makes it harder to run a full node for the average global citizen (think someone in Africa or Venezuela on low bandwidth). I also know that BTCs fees and speed are not at all great with the current scaling limits. We need to find a better solution to that handles both of these antagonistic issues.

With all of that said, bitcoin cash gives you what you want. It was also done outside the agreement. Don’t you think that it is possible if that coin didn’t exist then the fork would have happened? I know there is a culture of finger pointing on Reddit but don’t you see how the presence of this coin vastly complicated things?

Also don’t you see how an agreement for a coin who’s reason for value is being owned by no one is somewhat useless?

No one owns BTC man and for bitcoin cash I truly hope there is no central player either.

Edit: it's real, markets already in turmoil.  Interesting times indeed.

**FULL TEXT HERE**

The Segwit2x effort began in May with a simple purpose:  to increase the
blocksize and improve Bitcoin scalability. At the time, the Bitcoin
community was in crisis after nearly 3 years of heavy debate, and consensus
for Segwit seemed like a distant mirage with only 30% support among miners.
Segwit2x found its first success in August, as it broke the deadlock and
quickly led to Segwit’s successful activation. Since that time, the team
shifted its efforts to phase two of the project - a 2MB blocksize increase.

Our goal has always been a smooth upgrade for Bitcoin.  Although we
strongly believe in the need for a larger blocksize, there is something we
believe is even more important: keeping the community together.
Unfortunately, it is clear that we have not built sufficient consensus for
a clean blocksize upgrade at this time. Continuing on the current path
could divide the community and be a setback to Bitcoin’s growth. This was
never the goal of Segwit2x.

As fees rise on the blockchain, we believe it will eventually become
obvious that on-chain capacity increases are necessary. When that happens,
we hope the community will come together and find a solution, possibly with
a blocksize increase. Until then, we are suspending our plans for the
upcoming 2MB upgrade.

We want to thank everyone that contributed constructively to Segwit2x,
whether you were in favor or against. Your efforts are what makes Bitcoin
great. Bitcoin remains the greatest form of money mankind has ever seen,
and we remain dedicated to protecting and fostering its growth worldwide.

All bases are still covered by (pre-Aug1) hodlers:

- If not, it becomes all about Bitcoin Cash. 

- If Bitcoin Cash is vulnerable due to minority hashrate position, miners can still always fork away from Core later (though Segwit remains a lurking concern). 

We have to come to grips with the fact that we can be totally right about Core's utter idiocy and still be very EARLY. That increasingly looks like it may be the case.

Given the terrible state of segwit support in wallets (including bitcoin core's own GUI) its pretty clear that the core strategy is to use segwit to enable offchain technologies, not to use it to directly relieve onchain capacity.

Unfortunately setwit2x and the bitcoin cash fork (and the brief extension block proposal by was it bitpay?) also ended the BU EC+segwit compromise effort which was ongoing at that time.  Its a classic case of divide and conquer.

I hugely underestimated to power of core's propaganda/censorship machine and largely overestimated the backbone of the people signing the NYA. Also I never imagined how many big blockers would side with the devil, i.e. actually support core with all its censorship, propaganda, etc, just because they think Bitcoin Cash would profit. Not sure if they will profit from SW2x downfall, though. What do you think the propaganda machine will attack next? In my opinion today showed that the reasonable people in Bitcoin have ultimately lost.;11;1;False;Haatschii;dpja168;segwit2x canceled;https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-segwit2x/2017-November/000685.html

Now... they have Bitcoin Cash to point their hashrate at and to support. It would be smartest for them to make it a gradual shift so Bitcoin doesn't tank and pull everyone else down.

"Good news for Bitcoin Cash supporters.   
**Why?**   
Because who would BCH rather compete or co-exist with over time; Segwit1x or Segwit2x?   
2x was stronger. 1x is slower and less agile. It doesn't move or adapt well, because Core out-coached themselves and over-developed it. Core saddled its block-spine with controversial tech. Now, BTC can act as a settlement layer and store of value, but can't transact well.^1 Cash can do both. It can both store value (like gold) and exchange it (like cash).  
**Cash's competition is now locked to Core's technology and developers.**    
The fork could have also crashed the markets, and Core, like Gox Mountain, could have taken confidence and the crypto market down with it for a protracted period, which would have debilitated the critical momentum crypto has in its bigger battle against the banks. *If Cash has the better tech*, then a stable market favors it over-time.  Cash can embrace Core's defectors and methodically capture its market share as Core bleeds out and freezes off-chain.  Let them compete in the open market, and if BTC survives, which I suspect it still will, then we won't have two similar coins.  BTC can specialize as a store-of-value.  Yes, many wanted to defeat the Troll Army and save bitcoin from the Core kidnappers on 16 November 2017 at Block 494784, but this could have been a short-term victory for a long-term defeat.   
It's like the **Cold War**. The US and USSR could have nuked each other immediately, and the US may have survived, half-annihilated.  Instead, the US let the USSR spend themselves to death over-time in an arms race they couldn't win, because Communism produced inferior products and sowed dissent.    
**^1** Bitcoin is valuable because it has utility.  It has utility because it does things.  It does two things particularly well; it stores value and transacts it. Core intentionally limited bitcoin's ability to transact value, ostensibly to maintain decentralization and improve security. It did this by restricting the blocksize and developing bitcoin to process transactions off-chain. Blockstream, incidentally, owns patents to some of these sidechains. It openly plans to [profit](https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/923309367260274688) from them, and [reportedly](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6o2744/how_many_bitcoin_developers_are_employed_by/) pays many of Core's developers. Core's developers thus restricted bitcoin's utility as a medium of exchange, which also profits a business that pays them.

"You're confused. 

Miners can choose to impose additional rules at any time. For example, they can:

1. Disallow blocks bigger than 0.5 MB.
2. Disallow transactions involved certain addresses.

This is what is called ""soft fork"". It can be enforced by miners, they do not need consent of users. (E.g if miners only create blocks smaller than 0.5 MB you cannot do anything. You can still accept 1 MB blocks, but they do not come. You cannot force miners to create blocks >0.5 MB.)

On the other hand, if you allow things which were not allowed (e.g. 100 BTC reward, 10 MB blocks), that's a hard fork.

Thus:

1. miners can do soft forks without user consent
2. miners cannot do hard forks without user consent";6;0;False;killerstorm;dpinj7s;"Crypto joke: ""A guy wanted to commit suicide because the prices of his coin dropped"":";https://i.imgur.com/B1WlwOM.jpg

The more segwit txs in a block, the more txs fit in a block.  These blocks only have a few segwit txs.  As more services adopt segwit, these blocks will continually get larger.  We've seen plenty of 1.1mb, 1.2mb and even an 1.6mb block with segwit.

Additionally, the ""txs per block"" metric is pretty meaningless.  I can make one single tx that pays 4 different people, or I can make 4 separate txs that each pay one of those 4 same people.  Why are 4 txs better than 1 in this scenario if they represent the exact same economic activity?

I disagree slightly here. I think that low fees are very important as it lets wider demography access Bitcoin. These people, businesses and their various use cases form the market, which is an important part of keeping Bitcoin decentralized.

If we had wide economy instead of current, narrow one, largely limited to price speculation, then Bitcoin would be less centralized. As it stands it's basically few centralized exchanges (by what they list and omit, what tickers they use, what agreements they sign) and miners who are calling the shots on Bitcoin's future.

Ofcourse someone else might have better ideas. If those ideas are in conflict with Satoshi's vision/Bitcoin whitepaper, maybe that someone should write his own whitepaper and launch his own coin.

"**Straw man**

A straw man is a common form of argument and is an informal fallacy based on giving the impression of refuting an opponent's argument, while refuting an argument that was not presented by that opponent. One who engages in this fallacy is said to be ""attacking a straw man"".

The typical straw man argument creates the illusion of having completely refuted or defeated an opponent's proposition through the covert replacement of it with a different proposition (i.e., ""stand up a straw man"") and the subsequent refutation of that false argument (""knock down a straw man"") instead of the opponent's proposition.

This technique has been used throughout history in polemical debate, particularly in arguments about highly charged emotional issues where a fiery ""battle"" and the defeat of an ""enemy"" may be more valued than critical thinking or an understanding of both sides of the issue.

Well Bitcoin is still an ongoing experiment.

The correct sentence might have been if “you believe the tech characteristics described in the white paper will lead to a long term ,sustainable and secure currency”.

But there is still a level of “belief” lots of unknown ahead.

For example no cryptocurrencies have proven being able to remain secure **and** inflation free.

What is ""2 MB blocks""?

SegWit allows blocks up to 4 MB in size, but most likely in practice they will be limited to 2 MB. E.g. recently 1.6 MB block was mined. So we already have ~2 MB blocks on Core.

NYA agreement is about increasing max weight to 8 MB, so blocks up to 8 MB are possible.
