"Someone asked a question about implementation before LN was done and he answered “Bitcoin Cash”. That was it, he just said two words, not even an explanation as to why it was relevant. Of course he got fucking banned, do you think it would have been A-OK if he had just said “Ripple” instead? At best it was spam, but it definitely wasn’t just “a controversial opinion” that got him banned.

Reminds me of the people who go on T_D, make posts under alts saying horrible things like “I fucking hate n———, I love Trump!”, and then post screen caps to r/politics to make them look bad, ignoring the fact that that horrible shit gets deleted within minutes after being downvotes to oblivion. People believe anything if it’s part of their ridiculous groupthink. 

I see people post here all the time about how even mentioning BCash gets you banned. Maybe you should contribute to actual discussions instead of just screaming “BITCOIN CASH!”in random discussions like an idiot.

"Who said my first language is English or that I recide in America? You are making assumptions. You also assume that somehow I must know your mother tongue is not English, but how could I know, not unless you tell me. 

That aside BCH is still very new and has some VERY major flaws in the way it colludes with a certain bunch of Chinese miners and has direct links with the banisters at SBI Bits. Bitcoin never did that, Bitcoin retains its decentralisation and avoids miner centralisation as much as possible. Bitcoin is neutral, doesn't attack other coins, sure scaling didn't go the way everyone wanted but on-chain scaling is not off the books. Side chains makes Bitcoin very useful for a wide range of utility.  I'm not new to Bitcoin either, but everyone seems to claim they are Bitcoin old-timers so I really don't care how long anyone has been 'into' Bitcoin, people say all kinds of BS on the internet. 

Bitcoin is still just as great as the first time I discovered it, I'm very happy with its progress, slow and steady.  I can see right through all the BS from CSW, Ver and his motley crew of ex-cons and sociopaths and I'm very unimpressed by BCH and its crew so far, it's a bloody disgrace if you ask me.

"WORSE than useless...
As Doug Casey (and many others like Walter Block) [say](https://www.caseyresearch.com/doug-casey-on-controversial-buzzwords-part-i/):

*it’s a completely artificial crime. It’s made up. It was created out of whole cloth about 40 years ago, as I recall. Like most “crimes” today, it’s not wrong in itself; it’s wrong because some legislators passed a law [malum prohibitum].*

*There's nothing wrong, in principle, with money laundering.*

*Money laundering is a non-crime, and shouldn't be treated as a crime.*

*Perhaps you got the money illegally or immorally. And, incidentally, those are two totally different concepts, where there's only an accidental overlap. But that’s a big subject for a whole new conversation.*

*But what’s wrong with redeploying capital that already exists in a perfectly legal or moral way? I would say nothing. Money is fungible. It’s not like artwork—it’s not so easy to trace its provenance.*

*It’s counterproductive to make it illegal to take these so-called ill-gotten gains, and do something correct with them. It's just another Kafka-esque crime that they can arbitrarily use to hang you. At what point does capital created illegally become clean?*
____________
*Malum prohibitum* laws are just something that is declared illegal by a small group of ""authority"".
*Malum in Se* is something that is wrong or evil in and of itself like theft, murder etc...
