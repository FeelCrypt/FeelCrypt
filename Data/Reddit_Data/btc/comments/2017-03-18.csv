If those 10% really insist, they would have block times of 100 minutes and the retarget will take 20 weeks. Since no one can finance that and since any replay attack issue will only be on their side, BlockstreamCore has to create a hard fork with replay prevention for their alt-coin anyway.

"This is very nicely put.  

Speaking for myself- I'd agree that whatever flavor of BTC has overwhelming hashpower majority should be called BTC.  If there is a minority chain that persists for any length of time, it should be called, well, something else.  

I think the ideal end goal would be that there is NOT a minority chain which persists for any significant length of time.  In theory, this is possible to do.  
SegWit in its current form may cause problems but a chain split probably isn't one of them.  
And as for BU- if it gets 75% miner support the rest might come around and upgrade before the first >1MB block, if that happens no minority chain would be created.  Or if a very small percentage of miners refuse to upgrade (say 10% or less) then that minority chain would be so slow until the next difficulty period that it would be essentially useless and probably safe to ignore- at 10% of hash power that's 100 minutes per 1MB block...

That said, if a significant (>10-15%) of hash power insists on maintaining a non-BU chain, work must be done to separate the two and prevent replay attacks as quickly as possible.

"One of the challenges has been getting all of the members of the Bitcoin ecosystem together to help make decisions on the way forward. Superficially, a lot of effort has been made doing exactly this, except that the organizers of those conferences tended to keep excluding the people who wanted larger blocks, so a false sense of consensus ""emerged.""

How can your company be neutral in the debate when your director of engineering is the furthest thing from neutral and one of the most vocal proponent of segwit to the point of being trollish and literally spit on any on-chain scaling attempt. He wasnt even present at the BU presentation.

"Brian I think you should organize this, organize a meeting with the exchanges FFAAAARRRR away from Adam or any Blockstream or Core representative and hash this shit out.  No recordings, no spys, no documents, just a unified front.  What just transpired with a modified document is exactly what you described would happen.

The exchange risk goes both ways.  If the exchanges misrepresent BTC-c as BTC and ultimately BTC-u becomes BTC, you are exposed to misrepresentation.  The ONLY answer I can see is to list BTC-c and BTC-u.  That is purposefully neutral and each exchange could explain the difference with a notice and let things happen.  Only after things are settled down and clear would you redesignate appropriately.

"Thanks for your rather sane thinking. Unfortunately your hands are tied and you cannot give any serious objection to BlockstreamCore - they can ruin your business.

The whole naming problem is caused by Core's twist of reality when they lost the miner support.

">My goal is to have Coinbase be neutral in this debate.

Hahaha Bob... You're so full of crapola. Here's a couple of quotes from you:


[...Activating SegWit can help us get there and it has a number of good features](https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/817258720253988865)


[From learning more about SegWit I think we should activate it. It's prob the best path forward for bitcoin at this point.](https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/817258015619321857)

[Lets come together and move forward as an industry. Activating SegWit can help us get there and it has a number of good features.](https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/817258720253988865)


And from Charlie Lee

[..I can't imagine how we'd support {a non-Segwit} chain](https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/839676935768715264)

And those are just a few I could find in 5 minutes. I've read lots more that show you're not so ""*neutral* in this debate""

You probably didn't notice, but you've lost my business. I'm sure there are others. Sorry, I've moved to Gemini. At least if they *said* they were neutral, it's something I could believe. Now, don't get me wrong. You own the company, and it's your right to state whatever position you want. But please, don't piss on my leg and tell me it's raining

"> I think SegWit, BU or other solutions could all be made to work


Brian, you seem to think you are  like a teacher commenting on two student projects, you are  trying to encourage the students and be fair to both groups, otherwise their feelings may be hurt.

However, this is not about being fair between sides, this is a multi billion dollar live network. It is at least possible, in theory, for a group to present a fundemtally broken idea.  Do you at least accept there is such a thing as a bad idea?  When such an idea is presented, we have a duty should be frank and point that out, in order to protect the system.

"Thank you for your statement. Just curious from your position on the ""inside"" so to speak, do you have any hope that this years-long conflict will be resolved soon?

"Given the current circumstances the letter was neccesary. Bitcoin Unlimited is too unproffesional yet its continuing to gain hashpower. Its too spontaneus and this was a message from exchanges to the miners and bitcoin unlimited to take things more seriously and respect the stability of the ecosystem. I dont expect them to do that tho, its not in their vocabulary.

You also have to understand that people like Peter Rizun will only try to appease you. So when you ask for replay protection, they will say ""oh yes, good idea, we will look into that"" but they will never add it. You have to understand the primary drive behind Bitcoin Unlimited is power. They are not the kind of people who respect others. They just want power over them and will say and do anything to get it. So basically Coinbase is just a pawn to bitcoin unlimited, as is the common user in rbtc, Jihan Wu, Roger Ver etc. That is all.
