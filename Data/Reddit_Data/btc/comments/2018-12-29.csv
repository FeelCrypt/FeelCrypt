"> I apologize for using the definition of fractional reserve that Bitcoiners don't understand.

Don't apologize, we have the same definition of FRB. Just follow through on your example to see the problem. What happens to the $85 lent out? It is deposited again, either the same bank or some other custodial account. Let's say it gets deposited in the same bank. It now looks like the bank has a total deposit liability of $185. And %85 of $185 is $157.25. The bank can now loan up to 157.25. Since it already loaned the 85, the bank can loan the remaining 72.25. The original $100 gets compounded a number of times, but after merely two deposit-loan cycles the bank has already loaned 57.25 more than was deposited.

So how can this be recreated with crypto? You can't circulate 157.25 BTC just because someone deposits 100 BTC. Banks can do it with FRN because they simply make ledger entries on various accounts, noting the amounts are in USD. But you cannot merely note that someone now has 85 BTC in their account. You can, but the system will fail when any of the first depositors withdraw their funds.

The notion of a bitcoin custodial account is rather an oxymoron. A major point of bitcoin is to avoid the pitfalls of a failed custodian, often compounded by the side effects of FRB when there is a run on the bank.

"You're saying this because of a fundamental misunderstanding of what fractional reserve actually means. 

If I deposit $100 into a bank that utilizes fractional reserve banking, and their reserve requirement is 100%, then how much can get lent out? $0. Because every deposit needs to be fully backed.

If I deposit to a bank with a 15% reserve requirement, how much can it go on to lend out? $85, because they need to reserve 15% of my deposit in the form of cash or another instantly liquid asset.

Same could easily be done for crypto, supposing they had a large enough base of customers, and those customers were generally accumulating wealth, rather than spending money as quickly as they make it.

I apologize for using the definition of fractional reserve that Bitcoiners don't understand. But there is nothing magical in the scenario that I'm describing. It's simply the bank creating a reserve equal to the amount of liquidity their customer actually will need on a daily basis, so as to be able to put the rest of the money to work. Doing so creates enough income so that customers are not only not charged for deposits, but get paid interest, have balances up to a certain amount fully insured, and are provided access to cash across the ATM network rather than only being able to use their own banks ATM.";3;1;False;identicalBadger;ecrjh59;So true this is..............
