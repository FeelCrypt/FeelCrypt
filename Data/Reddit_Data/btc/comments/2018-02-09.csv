"> Look at what you are saying: Segwit = Soft fork = Miners change rules that the DCG want and users have no choice because it's a soft fork. 

Users absolutely had a choice.  If there was any significant majority of users who didn't want segwit, they could have kept running pre 0.13 releases, and simply spent one of these (as you call it) ""anyone can spend"" segwit txs.  They would have forced a fork, only needing a small minority hash rate to mine a single block.  Once the chain split, they'd orphan segwit blocks in favor of their non-segwit chain; a user-denied soft fork (UDSF).  The market would then sort it out fairly at the exchanges.  The miners would have switched over to that chain if it truly had the economic majority behind it (merchants, payment processors, exchanges, other economically relevant nodes, etc).

But the reality is that no one cared to even attempt this, because the people who didn't want segwit were the vast minority.  Honestly, if you Bcashers were smarter, this would have been your play.  This would have forced the debate into the marketplace, both claiming to be valid with the original chain.  But you didn't.  You guys made a new altcoin, 100% incompatible with the previous Bitcoin chain, and you got labeled as a altcoin permanently because of that.  I honestly believe you did this because you knew you couldn't win that debate.  Bcash had to be incompatible, because it had no hashrate due to a lack of economic support.  You had to fork off and change the difficulty.  That was the only way your chain had a chance of surviving.  Even with the bribery that then ensued, you still couldn't convince the miners or convince any significant percentage of the Bitcoin economy, to stick with you.

> Approximately 50% of miners had already removed the 1MB transaction limit 

With what, the AD/EB settings?  That's just coinbase text.  There is no proof that they were actually running buggy BU software or that they would actually accept a block larger than 1mb.  In fact, the only pool that was actually running it was Ver's, and that was proven when he comically mined an invalid block and lost thousands of dollars of revenue.

> I happen to be sitting in the same room as CSW when BCH fork date was set

Lol, you're not embarrassed to talk about that publicly? 

> I think you are wrong to conflate centralised planning and resort to ad hominid attacks to justify it.

What central planning have I advocated?  I literally went on a long winded rant about how in consensus systems, everything comes down to a fight in the free market.  All I care about is the economic majority.  We are all free to choose the implementation we run.  But we are financially incentivized to stick with the economic majority.  It's frustrating debating someone when they refuse to even read you argument.

> but when developers release code then it's CSW and Ver who are scammers. 

CSW and Ver are scammers because of their actions, nothing else.  I showed you proof.  Roger Ver is a pathological liar.  I've known people like him in my personal life, and they are toxic.  These people have an illness, and feel the need to lie and contradict themselves routinely.  Being in the public eye makes it worse for him because it's simple to point out so many times he's lied.  Craig is the same.  He's a special kind of fraudster because of his actions of claiming to be Satoshi.  Also, whatever happened to nChain?  I find it funny that you guys called Lightning ""vaporware"", even though multiple implementations were being developed on github, where the entire world was able to see it.  But you all promote nChain even though no one has ever seen a single line of code.

">but if the users won't run it, then their changes are worthless.

Look at what you are saying: Segwit = Soft fork = Miners change rules that the DCG want and users have no choice because it's a soft fork. 

You say ""technical community"" agree on the economic consensus rule changes (something one can easily argue they know little about) and when a corporation puts it into practice you ignore it, say it failed when in fact it was 100% successful.

Approximately 50% of miners had already removed the 1MB transaction limit and were in consensus with 100% of the network up until the DCG NYA. You almost see how it works then you resort to ad hominem attacks in suport of the centralised planning used to activate Segwit:


>The market works it out. Developers release their code, exchanges create their labels, miners can mine on whichever blockchain earns them the most revenue. Consensus is the result of the free market picking which chain is called what, and how much is it worth.

>there's a reason why BCH only existed because it was thought up and funded by Jihan Wu. BCH attracted frauds and liars like Craig Wright and Roger Ver.

I happen to be sitting in the same room as CSW when BCH fork date was set, I don't think he had anything to do with it, but as you say:

> **""The market works it out."" ""Developers release their code,""** ""That's where you guys go wrong""

I dont think I'm wrong I think you are wrong to conflate centralised planning and resort to ad hominid attacks to justify it. Intellectually you understand how it works in bold above but when developers release code then it's CSW and Ver who are scammers.

>small miners aren't going to keep the network secure from state impingement as effectively as large miners. 

It is your point of view and I firmly disagree with.

Do you realize that your are arguing **for** mining centralisation.

>a very large number of small miners distributed across the globe, would be comparable to a relatively small number of large miners distributed across the globe. 

The second one it is what high network fees tend to. (I have no idea you first example refers to, GPU mining maybe?)

High fees network help the big player by killing potential competition as they disproportionately impact smaller operations.

Take an example,two miner, same equipment, same cost, same profitability but different network fees, one 5$ the other one 0.5$.

They both take a payout of $100 and 90% profitability and I ignore pool fees.

* Example 0.5$:

Network fee for the pool payout 0.5$: left = 99.5$

Network fee to payout cost 0.5$: 99.5$-0.5$ = 99$ - cost (90$)  left 9$

This miner got his revenue reduced by 10% by a 0.5$ network fee.

* Example 5$:

network fees for the pool payout 5$: left = 95$

Network fee to payout cost 3$: 95$-5$ = 90$ - cost (90$) left 0$

This miner got his revenue annihilated by a 5$ fee.

The larger the payout the least affected you are, until you are a huge miner and can afford massive payout to absorb the fee cost.

"> But forcing high fees is more harmful.

this is what you said. I understood it as you meaning someone (Core) 'forcing' high fees. 

> And why fee market is good?

> That was my question that you seem to avoid replying.

the fee market ensures that there are rewards to miners above and beyond the block reward. this is extremely important to prove NOW with respect to the future - as it is the economic incentive PROOF that a fee market can keep the economic game theory in place in the future. 

> And do you think high high fees has no harmful effect?

yes, of course it does. The question is whether the harm is outweighed by the advantages. That is the discussion we should be having.

no i am not. don't tell me what i am and am not arguing for. You are interpreting my arguments one way - that may well be different to what i am trying to argue. 

> Take an example,two miner, same equipment, same cost, same profitability but different network fees, one 5$ the other one 0.5$.

this doesn't make sense. The network fees received are proportional to the network fee it costs to move the reward to an exchange to sell.
