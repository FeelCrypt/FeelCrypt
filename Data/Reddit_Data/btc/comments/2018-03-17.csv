"The problem is with XRP, which is optional, volatile, and replaceable.

- **Optional**. Banks don't have to use XRP in order to use Ripple.

- **Volatile**. Since XRP is volatile, it is not desirable as a bridge currency.

- **Replaceable**. There is absolutely nothing stopping Ripple from later rolling out XRP2 (pegged to USD), XRP3 (pegged to Euro), etc.  All it will take is a software update.

Ripple and its founders get to collect billions from a crypto-frenzied crowd by issuing a useless token called XRP.  After they've sold off all the XRPs, you think they'll just give up the gravy train?  Of course not.  They'll just start printing up XRP2, XRP3, etc.  It's free money for them.";1;0;False;normal_rc;dvu5rmv;Ripple is a funding scheme to help the banks fight Bitcoin. XRP is not Ripple.

"When a bank can convert the currency in 4 seconds, then there is no need for a bridge currency.  Just transact in the end currencies directly.  

The only reason there is a need for a bridge currency, is because some 3rd world currencies are illiquid, some even have strict capital controls or are in the middle of a civil war, and it might take days & paperwork to convert.  And in that time, the bank doesn't want to hold a volatile bridge currency which could move the wrong way, and incur losses.  The bridge currency should be as stable as possible.";1;1;False;normal_rc;dvtypzx;Ripple is a funding scheme to help the banks fight Bitcoin. XRP is not Ripple.

I'm bringing back the dead here, but I don't understand why people keep thinking the volatility matters. The banks own the XRP (and volatility) for 4 seconds, not days like the current SWIFT system. There's more volatility in the fluctuation of fiat over several days than there is in ANY crypto over 4 seconds. ;1;1;False;;dvtxlb9;Ripple is a funding scheme to help the banks fight Bitcoin.

The current SWIFT system used by 11,000 banks in 200 countries for the purpose of transacting payment orders locally and internationally takes anywhere from 1-5 business days.

Interesting concept, but how does it play out for defense of your nation if every country has converted to Bitcoin except China. In China they have their own central bank controlled money and can secretly print as much as they want to pay their citizens to do work, mine for raw metals in the country, make machinery, guns, tanks, fighter jets, warships and pay for the army/navy/airforce out of thin air. Essentially they can get everyone to do work for them for nothing. Now China want to invade their Asian neighbouring countries like Japan, Malaysia etc with their well fed and motivated 1 million strong army. How do the other countries defend? They have to expend Bitcoin to pay for their tanks, jets, frigates, troops, missiles, munitions etc and their Bitcoin is a finite resource. Once its spent, it's spent. Maybe the government can raise taxes on its corporations and citizens to fund the war effort but they might still only be able to muster half of what is required for defense. They will still get steamrolled by China who can pay for its army/navy and airforce for nothing.;4;4;False;j73uD41nLcBq9aOf;dvud64p;Central banker...;852rf3;https://i.redd.it/qv0da1u5nam01.jpg
