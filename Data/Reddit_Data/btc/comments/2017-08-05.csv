It's censoring via oligarchy vs censoring via groupthink. I've had a ton of deep discussion threads at /r/Bitcoin about big blocks, BCH, etc. Here you get instantly downvoted to -10 if you are pro-segwit or, in my case, want to *wait a while* for a block size increase.

Maybe it's better for people who prefer a chain without SegWit for whatever reason. Also historically, LTC development has been pretty much non-existent, but it's too early to say anything about Bitcoin Cash development.

Well for once BCC favours the user and User Experience (low prices, faster transactions) is what I believe will ultimately win out. I believe this will happen thanks to decentralisation. The BCC fork demonstrates that there is no monopoly on software. BTC wants Segwit? Fine another alternative will spring up and the market will decide.

">  I don't think it was naive to create a disinflationary currency. It was created with gold as an example

He used the gold mining analogy once in two years, yes.

> also a disinflationary currency

Gold is no longer a currency.  It has become a tool for the gambling game called precious metals speculation, and as such it is too volatile to serve as  a currency of commerce.  It is definitely worse than the dollar and the euro in that regard.

Gold is not really disinflationary either,  because it is continuously being mined, and the production grows as the price rises.  While the total amount of minable gold on the Earth is theoretically finite, the end is so far away that it can be ignored.  

On the other hand, it is true that the mining of gold is not connected to the growth of the economy; which contributes to the volatility of its price.  That is why it had to be abandoned as a backing for national currencies.  

Basing a currency on a ""digital gold"" would be a step backwards over a cliff.  The limited supply leads to speculation and volatility, as we have seen since trading started in mid-2010.  

The fact that the backing ""asset"" is digital removes the only qualities that made it a passable store of value in the past: its intrinsic value and its physical scarcity.   While bitcoin has a limited issuance, the number of cryptocurrencies is unbounded.  One can create infinitely many cryptocurrencies that have the same properties as bitcoin, but distinguished only by name -- like twin siblings.  Imagine how much gould would be worth if anyone could create a new metallic element, just as shiny, colorful, malleable, inoxidable, etc. as  gold...

"Yes, it says right what I said:

>Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments.  While the system works well enough for most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model. Completely non-reversible transactions are not really possible, since financial institutions cannot avoid mediating disputes.  The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions, and there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for nonreversible services.  With the possibility of reversal, the need for trust spreads.  Merchants must be wary of their customers, hassling them for more information than they would otherwise need. A certain percentage of fraud is accepted as unavoidable.  These costs and payment uncertainties can be avoided in person by using physical currency, but no mechanism exists to make payments over a communications channel without a trusted party.

Only coins focused on user experience will succeed.  

Bitcoin and Bitcoin cash are now in a race to see who can make the most customers (users) happy. 

May the best coin win,,,,, but the customer (the user) wins either way.  

We demand cheap, secure, fast honest money,  and if you don't give it to us we will find someone who will.

Under a fractional reserve system, inflation is vital. Without inflation, there is an immediate credit crunch. But it's not the other way around. You can't say we need inflation and therefore the current fractional reserve system is good. Inflation is a hidden taxation that end up in the wrong hands. Therefore we need to devise a system that does not need inflation to exist. Under the gold standard, inflation was non-existent. Under a cryptocurrency system, the same could happen.;2;1;False;hodlgentlemen;dl7t7mm;Just a quick reminder why Bitcoin was invented in the first place. This used to be preaching to the choir.

">Why would I purchase goods in bitcoin, which I know will be worth more tomorrow, when I can purchase the same goods at the same price in my local currency, which I know will be worth less tomorrow?

This is obvious. Because you don't have any cash, because you have all your money in bitcoin. You have all your money in bitcoin because, as you say, it will be worth more tomorrow and the cash will be worth less. 

Why would you exchange something that increases in value? Why do people sell rare coins or paintings? Why would you be holding something that decreases in value (cash) over something that increases? 

Thats why they say its important to diversify and not keep much percentage of your money in one spot, whether its one currency or one whatever. Also bc as you say the inflationary nature of our cash.

Why did the gold backed dollar work? It would've been worth more tomorrow than its worth today.

Its very obvious why one would part ways with soemthing that would be worth more tomorrow. Bc they found something else thats worth more to them. Why do you spend 100$ on a pair of shoes? cause, in that moment, you want the shoes more than you want the money. But those shoes? Do they increase in value faster than the 100 dollars you spent on em? No those shoes depreciate rapidly.

If you have any more questions just ask.

Why would you ever exchange something that increases in value for something that increases more slowly, or even decreases? If we assume this is true, there is no premise for holding cash to begin with. Thats where your argument is flawed. Its like youre suggesting you have an infinite amount of cash and of bitcoin, so you may aswell expend your cash first, since the bitcoin is better. But the thing is you dont have an infinite amount. and so if this is true, youd have most of your money in bitcoin right off the bat. There wouldnt be much cash to part ways with, bc as you say why would you ever want something that increases in value less, over something that increases in value more?

Right heres the problem, in this scenario, where its objective fact that bitcoin goes up in value and cash goes down in value, as each second passes, theres one gapingly obvious question. Why are you holding cash to begin with?

As you say, one might be reluctant to part ways with something deflationary in exchange for something inflationary or simply less deflationary, but by that same token that person must also inevitably be someone who is enticed by the prospect of exchanging something inflationary for something deflationary. So in this theoretical scenario, there is no reason why this person wouldnt already have all of their money in bitcoin (or something else deflationary, but they wouldnt be holding much cash out of any personal desire to. Again, as you say, why would you choose to hold something that will be worth less tomorrow over soemthing that will be worth more tomorrow?";7;2;False;BIG-DATA;dl79tam;Just a quick reminder why Bitcoin was invented in the first place.

"Because you asserting means its true. Please give me the blow by blow on how money is created.

It merely transfers temporary ownership just like the example i gave. You cannot spend it until i repay the loan. A bank expands credit, not money.

Alice deposits $10 into Bank A, they loan out $9 to Bob. The amount of money is still $10. Alice has no cash, but is promised $10 back in the future. Bank A has $1, but is promised $9 in the future. Bob has $9.

* Alice = $10 assets ($10 in paper)
* Bank A = $10 in assets ($1 in cash and $9 in paper) and $10 in liabilities.
* Bob = $9 in cash and $9 in liabilities

"i edited my last comment but il copy what i think is relevant here:

>is the message that despite how it may seem from ""civilian sam"" 's perspective, hes actually better off being paid in tobacco (rather than gold) bc otherwise the businesses get richer and richer? You want to force the business to be paid in tobacco, so it has to pay some fees while converting it to a deflationary asset (investing)? Is that how this is supposed to help sam..? I mean does it? honestly asking, maybe it can. From my perspective i wouldnt think it was enough to really work its way back to sam with any real significance, even if it happens many many times very very often.. but maybe i'm wrong.


right so you soften the effects of the depression, but at what cost? because we all know sam isnt investing his money, lol. Idk. I'm not convinced this is helping us as much as we as a society want to believe. No one wants to believe its as ramshackle as it seems. No one even entertains the thought, and i don't blame you. I myself keep thinking i'm missing something. But at the end of the day no one ever says anything more directly explaining why we need this than what you were able to come up with. Just some vague allusions to how it might theoretically work. ""Oh it helps people in debt because it becomes easier to pay as money becomes easier to come by"" thats one ive heard. No one can actually explain each transaction from the moment it comes off the press to the moment it somehow winds up in sams pocket. I understand its theoretically possible. But in practice? No one has a practical explanation for why this is as logical as its bizarreness suggests that it must be.

Right so you ""force them to do something useful with it"" and they turn around and buy gold? and i guess the fees on that gold are what winds up somewhere down the line going back in to sams pocket? idk.

"> Is it the medium of exchange thing? gold used to be used as a medium of exchange. We actually STOPPED using tobacco as a medium of exchange BECAUSE of inflation. Given the option, why would a society gravitate towards, and go out of their way to, use an inflationary medium over a deflationary medium?

[The Great Depression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression) was a pretty good reason to move away from the gold standard. By controlling the supply of currency, the central bank has a tool to soften these boom-and-bust cycles, like we've seen with Bitcoin a lot.

By having this tool, an added benefit is that they can actually accelerate economic activity through artificially inflating prices. Basically making cash an even shittier asset, forcing its holders to do something useful with it.

You can argue whether one institution should have so much power/responsibility, but providing economic stability is a valid concern with many counter-examples throughout human history.

"You should try to engage as opposed to just posting one-liners. Investopedia isn't always right. You're kind of a stupid tool though.

If that interpretation were true, then countries with no reserve requirements would be in periods of massive hyperinflation. Even the US's reserve requirements only apply to a small fraction of total deposits. I feel like I'm talking to a wall, but banks expand credit, not money. They exchange current dollars for future dollars. Notice in the Invetopedia example, Tom can no longer spend the $1000 he just loaned. He has given up that right in exchange for $1000 plus interest in the future.

Tamny explains it far better on how you need to look at both sides of the ledger:

""In truth, just as there are no sellers without buyers, there are no borrowers without savers; thus rendering the very notion of a money multiplier moot.  $1 million doesn't multiply into $10 million if it changes hands enough times; rather for someone to borrow someone else must be willing to cease using money in the near-term so that they can. That such an absurd bit of witchcraft has so long transfixed so many bright minds is one of life’s great mysteries. So while banks doubtless commit all manner of errors – capitalism is about both failure and success – the fact that they lend out the funds put in their care does not make them counterfeiters.""

"Ultimately, what is the nugget of truth youre trying to show me?

And really what is there to ensure price stability of anything? No ones holding a gun to anyones head insisting they treat USD as valuable. Theres not even a law that says a can of soda cannot be sold for more than one dollar, or more than 100, or even 1,000,000 dollars.

So really is there any protection? And what exactly is it protecting? And who is it for and who is it from? You know. Theres no protection. You cant force people to recognize the value of something or force them to recognize worthlessness of something. Or can you? idk. Maybe you can i actually dont know but yeah i mean at the end of the day.. the only thing keeping this going is momentum. Theres no underlying thing gauranteeing that every shop keeper wont wake up tomorrow and decide to raise the price to 100 for a can of soda.


And honestly do you even hear what youre saying. Do you see what youre proposing. OK so everyone has bitcoin. Now you say everyone stops spending it and starts hoarding it. So when they get hungry waht happens? you know. they spend some money. 

Youre saying the rich hoard more and more btc and become even richer? They are already free to buy what has always essentially been the equivalent of btc, gold.

I may be missing a point. I think you may be overestimating the significance of that point though. I did show why the guy is a bit clumsy in his assessment of the situation. Please though, explicitly tell me the point i missed so at least i dont go any further missing something.

Is it the medium of exchange thing? gold used to be used as a medium of exchange. We actually STOPPED using tobacco as a medium of exchange BECAUSE of inflation. Given the option, why would a society gravitate towards, and go out of their way to, use an inflationary medium over a deflationary medium? 


So ""civilian sam"" has the option of being paid in tobacco or an economically equal amount of gold. So why does he choose tobacco?

I guess maybe he doesnt cause who doesnt want a store of value right so he chooses the gold. But he wants it as a medium foofexchange right so im following... so when his stomach does start to rumble, why would he be better off converting it to tobacco before buying a sandwhich?

edit: or is the message that despite how it may seem from sam's perspective, hes actually better off being paid in the tobacco bc otherwise the businesses get richer and richer? You want to force the business to be paid in tobacco, so it has to pay some fees while converting it to a deflationary asse (investing)? Is that how this is supposed to help sam..? I mean does it? honestly asking, maybe it can. From my perspective i wouldnt think it was enough to really work its way back to sam with any real significance, even if it happens many many times very very often.. but maybe i'm wrong.

But heres the thing thats also all based on the assumption that sam goes out and exchanges his tobacco for deflationary assets too. But we all know that's not what sam does.

The greatest barrier to crypto being used as a regular currency for day to day transactions is price stability.  You have the HODL folks on one side (hodl != exchange), and folks afraid of potentially being stuck on the wrong side of a downswing.  Still, tons of potential once it calms down a bit, and even though use in exchange is limited, it is probably the only important example of someone creating a global alternative currency in recent history.;20;3;False;grandaha;dl7a81p;Just a quick reminder why Bitcoin was invented in the first place.

"Sorry to pour some cold water, but there is no evidence that Satoshi had those intentions.  

He definitely never claimed that bitcoin could replace national currencies.  Although he twice mentioned ""central banks debasing currencies"", at the very beginning (in the announcement to the crypto list and in the introduction to the whitepaper), AFAIK he never mentioned that again in the following two years.  

In fact, he barely discussed the currency and its economic implications.  His focus was the *payment system*.  Inventing a new currency was necessary to keep the payment system decentralized.  I am sure that, if he could have made a decentralized system work with dollars, he would have done so -- it would have made adoption much easier.

He made his new currency non-inflationary (as I would have done myself in his place), but that only confirms that he was a computer guy quite naive about the economics of money (as I was).

On the other hand, he wrote in the whitepaper that traditional payment systems work well for most purposes.

His answer to the ""scaling problem"" was to say that Moore's law would take care of it, because he assumed that traffic would grow more slowly than computing power per dollar -- that is, less than 50% per year.  At that rate, it would take decades to reach Visa levels, and even longer to reach the scale needed to replace national currencies.  And he only wrote that bitcoin *could* scale to Visa size; he never stated that it was *meant* to.

He also mentioned the privacy afforded by banks as an ideal that bitcoin could approach only if used with care.

The headline in the ""genesis"" block had a technical purpose, namely to prove to potential collaborators that the block had been created on that day.  (Otherwise they might suspect that he had been mining a chain in secret for years, and might dump it in the future to cause a total reorg, with double spends and all.)  Thus the ""message"" had to be a headline of a major newspaper of that day.   Arguably /The Times/ was the best choice of newspaper, for a project that aimed to an international user base.  (If one thinks about it, that headline has no relevance to currencies or payment systems.)

Thus, the picture that comes out of his writings is a computer professional interested in the technical problem that had been open for 25 years, with mainstream and naive views of economics.  Not at all an anarcho-libertarian reformer aiming to destroy banks and end the control of money by governments..

"I don't understand why bitcoin is different from cash, in many of these respects.

Can't I deposit bitcoin in a bank? They could choose to accept deposits, couldn't they? They'd accept all the risk around backups, cybersecurity, theft, etc., and perhaps offer me interest. These are the main reasons I put my money in a bank today. I'm not rich, but if I was, I'd certainly want most of my money - fiat or bitcoin - with someone more dependable than myself.

Can't a bank also loan people bitcoins, and charge interest?

With the government's permission, can't a bank continue to lend people more bitcoins than they actually hold in assets? Fractional reserve banking, I think this is called.

(You might be thinking no, they can't lend two people the same bitcoin, because bitcoins are unique. But remember, the same applies for bank notes. They still lend the same money to multiple people, because fiat money is fungible. Bitcoin is similarly fungible, isn't it?)

Is bitcoin really fixing the financial system?

"""What remains is an inflation rate in the 2% range.""


I always thought this was good for society?


If people know prices are always slowly going up, they spend their money. Products will be cheaper now than in a year, while their saving will be the same. It makes sense to spend.


This is good thing. If I'm a business owner of any sort, I need people to spend their money to live. It's how the economy operates. This is why governments try hard to maintain this optimal 2% (not-too-big, not-too-small) inflation rate.


In a situation of deflation, people will know that prices are going down. Why spend their money today, when they can spend it tomorrow and get more bang for their buck?! This leads to less spending. This hurts my business and the economy.


What I don't understand about Bitcoin, is it aims to create this undesirable effect. The value of Bitcoin compared to goods is constantly going up. Why would we ever spend it?

"Excellent points. And because of this, I think this underlines one of the major points that is counter to Bitcoin Core's philosophy as a store of value: do we really need to store a $5 purchase for a cup of coffee on the blockchain?

And the answer is yes. Because Bitcoin is a digital currency to allow free trade, and thus should not be discriminating or favoring any transaction. A transaction is a transaction, no matter how big. When we get into the business of favoring one type of transaction over another simply because of its size or value, then there has to be some group or organization that dictate what is and what isn't a valid transaction to store on the blockchain. Or we have to set standards to what gets put on the blockchain, and those can change radically and invalidate portions of the blockchain. 

The point is, it creates a centralized point of control or failure and that is totally counter to the idea of unmitigated free trade. And this whole issue is taken off the table when all transactions are treated equally.";2;0;False;RedLanceVeritas;dl7jjuc;Just a quick reminder why Bitcoin was invented in the first place.

">When it was tried to launch a private currency backed by precious metals (Liberty dollar), this initiative was shut down because it undermined the U.S. currency system. Apparently, a currency alternative could only thrive if “nobody” launched it and if they was no central point of failure.

Gona argue this one with you.  The problem with the Liberty Reserve product was that  it was deceptive and moderately fraudulent.  A big part of the underlying story was to convince people that his silver rounds were equivalent to (IIRC) originally $10, then $20 or 50, in USD notes.  And a lot of people were drawn in on the prospect of being able to pass his silver at a markup as a scam.

Nobody would have a problem with him if he said ""It's an ounce of silver"" and encouraged participants to price their goods in ounces of silver.  Or if he made his own currency which could float freely against the USD.  ""It's the Happy Silver Dingleberry, backed by an ounce of silver and with its own exchange rate.""  But the whole thing was clearly designed with the hope people would use his coins and notes at par with the USD, rather than at par with their silver value.

The ultimate sin of this scheme was that he started to debase his own psuedocurrency.  The first ones, as I said, were an ounce of silver denominated at $10; later ones were at $20 or more.  It completely undermines the narrative of ""it's a real asset and can't be manipulated to cause inflation.""";2;2;False;Bounty1Berry;dl7je6j;Just a quick reminder why Bitcoin was invented in the first place.

""Attorney for the Western District of North Carolina, Anne M. Tompkins, described the Liberty Dollar as ""a unique form of domestic terrorism"" that is trying ""to undermine the legitimate currency of this country"".[29] The Justice Department press release quotes her as saying: ""While these forms of anti-government activities do not involve violence, they are every bit as insidious and represent a clear and present danger to the economic stability of this country.""[29]""

1. You don't need a bank to transfer bitcoin over a large distance. You can only transfer cash face to face.

2. You can't ""print"" and lend bitcoin out of thin air. That is double spending.

3. Final question: That is similar to the idea of Lightning Network, which will be easier to implement after Segwit activate. The consequences are we get a much better currency than fiat (Segwit or not), banks and goverments have to adapt or risk falling behind. **Virtual currency will move on, with or without their recognization**.

"A note on your first couple of points: 
For the majority of human history, virtual credit has been the norm, and not physical money. Coinage wasn't introduced until the late ancient age, around the time of classical Greece. Before that time, and much later in other parts of the world, people didn't carry gold and silver to the market. They kept tabs of different kinds of credit with each other. This has also been true after the fall of Rome, and all through the middle ages. Coinage and physical money was the exception, not the norm.

"I read Graebers book and what you say is correct.

It's interesting to note that physical money or commodity-backed money tends to be used when there's not a lot of trust. Like when trade exandend beyond the boundaries of some tribe where ""debt record-keeping by everyone remembering"" just wouldn't work so well.

So the less trust there is among economic actors, the more sense commodity-backed money makes. And what is the place actors trust each others the least? Yes, exactly: the internet.

Hence Bitcoin: the trustless money of the internet, where noone trusts anyone else, so everyone needs sound money.

"Close but no cigar. Coinage was introduced at least as early as the Mesopantian epoch, going back to at least 2150 BC during the Akkadian rule; later Hammurabi himself designated a workman's salary to be the equivalent of 10 shekels (coinage) per year.

"I should have qualified that statement. I just mean that the btc rise can't solely​ be from users selling bch to buy back  btc, _and_ likewise users selling their existing btc to buy bch.

The price rise definitely could be attributed to people selling bch and rebuying btc, as long as the dumped bch was bought with fiat, or proceeds from other alt sales. 


Edit:

Meaning if you restrict trading to just users swapping existing btc and bch, it's a closed system and net value would have to remain constant. Net value didn't remain constant, so influence outside the strict swapping of existing pairs had to drive that.

"You're not a bitcoiner if you think there are 2 sides to the scaling debate. There is only one.

The capacity increase is happening if you want it or not, it hasn't happened yet, 2X is just the first HF,  (most useful idiots think it is segwit for some reason)

there is a contingency plan with BitcoinCash, if BS/Core Blocks the capacity increase, or we cant fork from 2MB fast enough (the economic bug being the transaction limit, could kill the main chain very fast.) 

The only solution now is to remove the capacity limit or die. If you can't see it you will learn the hard way. if you think you are smart bet on the winning side, if you have one grain of doubt Hodl both chains and wait it's going to be unbelievable. BS/Core will do more than 1 fork to try prevent what is now inevitable - central planing in action.

It's generally understood that in investing it is prudent to buy low and sell high. Bitcoin Cash currently enjoys being the only alt coin to have actually forked from the block chain, bringing with it all the characteristics of bitcoin with the ability to have larger blocks on-chain. Ether is inflationary and lite coin has segwit, so i don't know why you would choose that as a diversification from bitcoin with segwit.;1;1;False;centripetalwave;dl77f2b;BTC just broke $3000!!!;6rpifz;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6rpifz/btc_just_broke_3000/

The fact is, I have read through the white paper for bitcoin, I have discussed and thought about the complexities of bitcoin with coworkers and on Reddit and I simply want to see the scaling of bitcoin happen.

"They've been trying for almost three years at this point. In fact, what was by the far the most thorough test ever for big blocks in BTC was done by an operator of a small 750kwhr mining farm located in the USA. He forked testnet using his own resources to do so and ran analysis that showed, back in 2015, that 3-4MB blocksizes would have been safe at that time. He never asked for donations, had no corporate backing, and whatever mining power and setup time it took to do this was all out of his own pocket. 

Blockstream has $76million in funding with huge corporate backing and the best they could do is have Luke-jr knowingly lie about the speed at which internet bandwidth is increasing and then write a single page analysis with zero testing about how we should lower the blocksize limit down to 300kb based on his previously stated false projection. Then the co-founders and executives at Blockstream write thousands of posts about how ""unsafe"" bigger blocks will be based on them essentially doing no work in testing or developing them.

Big blockers are completely welcome to work with Blockstream and Core so long as they never even think about bringing up the topic of increasing the blocksize limit until Blockstream says it is allowed.";11;0;False;Bitcoinopoly;dl6xcbi;BTC just broke $3000!!!;6rpifz;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6rpifz/btc_just_broke_3000/

"Not true at all. 

Being a payment system is a feature of bitcoin. It's main feature is that it is the gold standard of cryptocurrency. You can thereafter use your bitcoin to buy a whole lot of other cryptos with various features. There is, even today, a thriving underground black market - as long as things like drugs etc are illegal, bitcoin and other cryptos will have use. It is an easy way to conceal/secure your wealth. The biggest feature bitcoin has is the liquid market - hodlers create this liquid market - which allows bitcoin hodlers to buy more or cash out anytime with ease.

Instant payments with low tx fee is a desirable feature, and most hodlers believe it would be fixed in due course. Even if bitcoin never scales, sidechains will fix this problem and bitcoin would still have extremely strong fundamentals because of the reasons I have stated above.

The more BTC appreciates in price, the more appealing it becomes to diversify into BCH.  The lower BCH goes, the more enticing it becomes to accumulate coins.

BCC won't split the community. BCC was a reaction to the community splitting (or being split maliciously). It's clear as day right now which side was right. You might want to make a new account and play nice on /r/Bitcoin. You should also probably apologize to core if you're still holding any Bitcoin.;6;5;False;Sugar_Daddy_Peter;dl6uc26;BTC just broke $3000!!!;6rpifz;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6rpifz/btc_just_broke_3000/
"It already split the community. Good thing it only split off some of the vocal minority. I just hope they all talked with their wallets as well.

99+% of people who use Bitcoin couldn't care less about the probably less than 1% of people arguing on a few Bitcoin message boards thinking they know better for everyone. So people just look at BCH as free money, dump it and forget about it.";1;1;False;bathrobehero;dl6uqxb;BTC just broke $3000!!!;6rpifz;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6rpifz/btc_just_broke_3000/
"I know that in Bitcoin this is often said; but this is not Bitcoin. This is just one of the hundreds (thousands?) of scam coins out there. I'm not necessarily saying its value will fall to $0; many scam coins have a non-zero exchange rate. But BCash will never be Bitcoin. It never had a chance. We are talking about a project so rushed they couldn't even do their due diligence to make sure BCC was not already taken. 

BCash is just capitalizing on discontent within the community. Some people want Bitcoin to have larger blocks; that's a fine desire; but this Fork is proving that you can't just go and implement what you want on Bitcoin without consensus. 

Just because some people want it; doesn't mean it is feasible to implement. There are plenty of other coins that transmit more data per second; with their own organic communities; their own hashing algorithms.

You can't hijack Bitcoin without consensus; and that is what this Fork is proving.

So go ahead and Buy the Dip yourself; but I think its incredibly reckless of you to suggest that to others. How would you feel if someone invests their last $1000 in BCash only for it to Crash down to $5-$10. 

BCash is insanely risky. It might have a chance of a comeback in a few months when difficulty adjusts if blocksize becomes a politically charged issue again. I wouldn't bet on it though.

"It's a fool's gold. I have no stake in these horses anymore because I sold my coins due to community split and uncertainties, needed the cash anyway. But Bitcoin Cash had no chance and I don't know why /r/btc had such euphoria for it. I see threads of people asking ""WTF"", which is comical to me because correction was coming soon. ""Buy the dip?"" Good luck man. It will always be second best to Bitcoin, just like Eth Classic.

"Nope! The Free Market is perfect and should decide everything in our day to day lives. We don't need any regulation or outside control, just the perfect machinations of capital. 

However, in this case the market is wrong. Let me explain what we need to do:

First we mine BCH as a charity to keep blocks moving, but not too much! We want difficulty to adjust so mining becomes profitable again. At that point free market economics will take over and BCH will moon, destroying Segwit coin on the way... any coin that has TRUE FREEDOM (as in market) will inevitably win. I believe in free market economics so I know this is true.

BRB locking myself in a dark room until BCH has all of BTC's market cap, plus the market cap of every other coin that wasn't FREE enough. I already sold all my BTC for BCH, so all I need to do now is wait, right?";1;1;False;;dl71n92;BTC just broke $3000!!!;6rpifz;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6rpifz/btc_just_broke_3000/
