"The fee estimations don't consider busy and less busy phases.  They just see that 50 sat/B took three weeks to confirm. So they assume 50 is not enough, even though it currently is.  The opposite happened three weeks ago when 100 sat/B used to confirm quickly but suddenly didn't.

The Christmas and New Year holidays were less busy than the week before. It's not that surprising if you think about it.

"> If you move them from a paper wallet to an online wallet you can't use them until you have X number of conf.

From the standpoint of the system, you can create a follow-up transaction even without the first one being confirmed. In that case, all these transactions will likely be included in the same block.

From your description of the problem, by ""online wallet"", you probably mean a custodian that is *not* you. These wallets are not needed (or advised) in order to simply transact. Being able to directly send money from your own personal wallets (:no custodian or third party) is pretty much the reason for Bitcoin. Most such software support sweeping paper wallets.

If a custodian is really what you want (:exchanges, etc.), it is normal for the recipient to wait for 6 confirmations for finalization though. 1-2 hours is not really extreme.

you place too much importance on these non mining nodes.  they are not the emphasis.  true decentralization comes from mass user adoption.  gvts are powerless when every one of their citizens is using BCH.  it certainly can't and won't happen with the economic boondoggle that LN is.

that's stupid.  non mining node counts are not representative of the people.  real people will never run nodes; they just want to use BCH cheaply and efficiently.  that will never happen with BTC and core dev has already admitted they don't want this to happen.  miners are what makes the network secure, not Sybil prone non mining nodes.

"When a transaction happens on Bitcoin, the P2P transaction is broadcast to the network and miners confirm the transaction. When a transaction happens on LN, miners will still need to confirm that transaction, but before miners can confirm the transaction, LN needs to confirm the transaction. In order to open up a channel on LN, you must have X amount of Bitcoin, which at this moment, needs to be at a minimum above the Bitcoin blockchain transaction fee. Sure, there may be 100's or 1000's of transactions being confirmed in that one channel, but it still needs to be above the transaction fee. So if you are not the guy with enough Bitcoin to open and close channels, then you are relying on someone that does have enough Bitcoin to open and close the channels.

"Where do you think the word idiot originates from?

Edit: from Wikipedia

>In 19th- and early 20th-century medicine and psychology, an ""idiot"" was a person with a very profound intellectual disability. In the early 1900s, Dr. Henry H. Goddard proposed a classification system for intellectual disability based on the Binet-Simon concept of mental age. Individuals with the lowest mental age level (less than three years) were identified as idiots; imbeciles had a mental age of three to seven years, and morons had a mental age of seven to ten years.[9] The term ""idiot"" was used to refer to people having an IQ below 30[citation needed][10][11] IQ, or intelligence quotient, was originally determined by dividing a person's mental age, as determined by standardized tests, by their actual age. The concept of mental age has fallen into disfavor, though, and IQ is now determined on the basis of statistical distributions.[12]

It's not a problem for idiots.  It's an opportunity for geniuses to exploit.  The advantage of flat, simple systems such as Bitcoin is that simplicity provides few(er) nooks and crannies in which to hide exploits.

"Yeah because as the blocks fill the fees get giant.  So people could screw with the lightning network.  A hostile actor can close the channel and try to steal funds, and the only way to get your funds back is to broadcast on-chain and pay a huge fee.  These small blockers [advocate for $1000 fees per transaction](https://cointelegraph.com/news/ari-paul-tuur-demeester-look-forward-to-up-to-1k-bitcoin-fees).  So every time a hostile actor messes with you, you have to make a transaction costing $1000.  So this will inevitably lead to centralized hubs, [and LN has been proven to be centralized](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6jqrub/game_over_blockstream_mathematical_proof_that_the/), and [I link some sources showing that in this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7n4pym/this_comment_i_just_made_explains_why_bitcoin/ds0gkvu/).  If your transaction gets stuck you aren't going to be able to recover the funds from the attacker.  It leads to huge security problems.  Governments can use it as an attack vector as well [as Jiang Zhouer says](https://cointelegraph.com/news/chinese-exchange-huobi-asks-bitcoin-core-expert-to-address-scaling-issues):

> LN [Lightning] will nurture monopoly LN processor like Alipay or Wechat Pay. By that time, the government could easily shut down the LN in the name of AML.

"Came here to say this. It's not that they'll need _a_ block size increase it's that any time there is an on-chain backlog everyone using lightning will be at risk of the blockchain failing in its role as ""court"" or ""arbiter"" (her words).

They say they need a fee market to avoid degenerate selfish mining behaviors when the block reward drops, but on-chain fees will establish a floor below which it will literally cost you so much to prevent a lightning counterparty from stealing from you that it will not be worth your while. No one will be able to safely open a lightning channel unless it contains significantly more funds than whatever they anticipate the maximum fee to be during the lifetime of the channel.

"It doesn't though. The original transaction that's been agreed to has a fixed fee. So the malicious actor would have to pay acceleration fees off the blockchain to accelerate their transaction in case of a full mempool.

In response, the person who is attacked can simply pay the going rate for a quick transaction, and they in turn receive BOTH sides of the lightning network channel. In this case the attacker loses both their acceleration fees (generally higher than a simple high fee transaction) and the entire value of their side of the channel.

This does impose some constraints on the channels, namely that they maintain enough value on both sides to make an attack unprofitable, but even if it were to become technically possible, the attacker is still risking far more than the attacked.

It must be done the right way, which is with careful planning and the backing of everyone in the Bitcoin community (or at least the large majority of it). That being said, I think a blocksize increase up to 8mb is completely fine if we get consensus, but this idea of unlimited blocksize that BCH is championing is complete nonsense. Blocksize increases should require meticulous, well thought out discussion and analysis by professionals (not us peasants on a bch subreddit) that the community can get behind.

And just to add about the title, which is absurdly misleading (nowhere does she mention nor imply that a blocksize increase would be needed for this particular scenario) you will have to close a channel, yes.

"Don't bother looking at the most cursory information on the topic.  This is by design. Game Theory, it's how the thing works. 

As usual this place attempts to re-characterise benign information as conspiracy, preaching poor quality ""analysis"" at the choir.

This penalty transaction broadcast is the entire point. Blockchain serves as the ledger under everything that allows people to recover from bad actors without loss.

Won't work without block size increases? You see millions of bad actors throwing away their money? That's a very strange conclusion, not based at all in reality.

That said, if you read the roadmaps you'll see block size increases are part of the scaling plan, all these things are part of the puzzle.

"For a computer scientist, a system is secure if there is a mathematical proof that it cannot fail, or at least a mathematical proof that the probability of failure is less than X% for some very small X.  (That, for example, is what Satoshi proved for the reversal of 6-confirmed transactons.)

For a computer/software engineer, a system is secure if there is empirical data about the components and an empirically validated usage model from which one can conclude that the probability of failure is less than X%, for very small X.  (That, for example, is how engineers can build computers that do billions of complex computations per second, for years nonstop, without a single failure.)

"Add it to the list.

I'm more worried about the collusion-theft vector:

----

Alice has a channel with Bob. They're both funded and the channel is working just fine. Bob pays Charlie a small fee to monitor his channel with Alice and broadcast the punishment transaction if Alice tries to cheat. Bob goes out of town for the night, secure in his knowledge that Charlie is being paid to watch his channel in his absence.

Charlie, unbeknownst to Bob, is actually Alice's old friend and business partner, and also operates a significant mining operation. This is an independent operation that he keeps separate from his monitoring services, but does have the ability to influence the mempool of those miners arbitrarily. Alice provides Charlie with one of her closure transactions, and offers to pay Charlie treble his usual fee to maliciously close the channel.

Charlie takes the money and pushes the theft transaction to his miners, *without notifying the rest of the network or broadcasting the transaction*. The transaction isn't seen publicly - only to his private miners - so his watchdog service is *totally unaware of the theft attempt*. Charlie has overnight (the life of the channel) to attempt to mine that transaction; his success has a financial incentive; and, Bob is powerless to detect or prevent the attack. He wakes up in the morning, comes back into town, and discovers that Alice has closed his channel and Charlie didn't earn his pay - or doesn't, if Charlie's miners were unlucky, *and is none the wiser*.";3;0;False;chernobyl169;ds1dueh;Elizabeth Stark of Lightning Labs admits that a hostile actor can steal funds in LN unless you broadcast a transaction on-chain with a cryptographic proof that recovers the funds.

The LN transactions are time-locked and use smart contracts to determine where the funds are at. Both parties must sign for any further changes: when one party leave the channel, they can only take the funds that have been authorized on both sides of the channel, and must wait until the expiration window closes for the other party to respond. This is what she said...there will be no stealing of funds because both parties would have to sign onto the theft, which then is no longer a theft.

"My read of lightning is that you open a channel with funds in it.   If u disagree with the other side of the channel (like if they try to claim more belongs to them) then u have to broadcast the dispute to the blockchain.   That's fine as long as it's cheap to broadcast.  But if a transaction is expensive the whole thing falls apart because it is expensive to take the dispute ""to court"" bc even if you win u still have to pay several transaction fees to dispute and close one channel and open another.

The situation is not fundamentally different with LN.  (More money tied up means need for fewer transactions.)

Small blocks are centralizing Bitcoin mining in general as well, because they limit adoption which limits the rate at which new miners enter the industry.

No, I don't think that is correct. The issue here is for a single transaction. If you are a node somewhere in the middle of a transaction, the next node in line can decide to not pay you the 10 cents. You have no way to know if its malicious or if they are simply offline. The only way to force them to pay you that 10 cents is to broadcast that specific transaction on the blockchain and close the channel.

Imagine how much face would be lost if they had to ape BCH and increase the raw blocksize because Segwit failed. And remember, Maxwell - whose single email became Core's roadmap - is ""popping the champagne"" (his words) to celebrate the current absurdly high fees. 

You really think he's gonna want to increase blocksize and rain on that champagne party? Also recall that he cofounded a company that employs or contracts with many of the key Core devs and got $100 million in venture capital (aiming for a 10x return, as is typical in the VC world) based solely on a business plan that aims to keep the BTC chain crippled (in its cacacity *and* its opcodes) while offering those same capabilities offchain.

"Exactly, if the fee is 1000 dollars, then it means any channel must contain at least 2000 dollars, for Alic/Bob to have motivation to close the channel (using all the funds from the counterparty to pay for the fee) . That means a channel must be as big as 2000 dollars, totally out of reach of most of the users

In fact, this ""punishing"" mechanism is so ugly thus I doubt it is a result of a flawed design: When a design has fundamental security loophole, people will use many strange patches trying to cover that hole, but they can not totally eliminate the problem from the root, just moved it from one area to another

Traditionally, in a payment channel, both party must agree on a single point of truth (the current balance of each user), and that truth can only be decided by the trusted authority, thus it is always a centralized model

LN is trying to achieve the same single point of truth without relying on a trusted authority, it is like making a perpetual motion machine, I don't think that is achievable theoretically, thus you see they are making all sorts of strange mechanisms similar to those strange designs you see in a perpetual motion machine prototype";20;2;False;vattenj;ds13yx5;Elizabeth Stark of Lightning Labs admits that a hostile actor can steal funds in LN unless you broadcast a transaction on-chain with a cryptographic proof that recovers the funds.
