"He literally wasn't charged for ""conspiracy to murder"" - at least not in the jurisdiction that actually went to trial. He is convicted of the following charges ([directly from his indictment on justice.gov](https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/usao-sdny/legacy/2015/03/25/US%20v.%20Ross%20Ulbricht%20Indictment.pdf)):

 * Narcotics trafficking conspiracy
 * Continuing criminal enterprise
 * Computer hacking conspiracy
 * Money launder conspiracy

He was indeed indicted for murder-for-hire in another jurisdiction, but that indictment never went to trial, so Ross never had a chance to defend those allegations (they likely would not have stuck because everything around the supposed murder-for-hire involved the FBI agents that were later criminally charged for stealing bitcoin and other corrupt activity surrounding the Silk Road investigation. For all we know, it was one of these corrupt agents that called for the supposed hits).

Nonetheless, the judge in Ross's case explicitly used these unproven allegation in the sentencing - something that *should* be unconstitutional. But the Supreme Court is refusing to hear arguments for why using unproven allegations to guide sentencing is wrong.

So, yeah, ""serving double-life for a website"" is a pretty accurate summary of Ross's situation.";10;0;False;timepad;e2duplw;Sign the Petition for Clemency for Ross Ulbricht, Serving Double Life for a Website;8yu0m8;https://www.change.org/p/president-of-the-united-states-clemency-for-ross-ulbricht-serving-double-life-for-a-website
