">  I think I just disagree with your assessment that either Segwit-good, 2x-hardfork-bad is the result of any kind of command and control, centralized anything.

I've watched Bitcoin closely for years. There was a distinct change about three years ago when Greg Maxwell started his power grab in the vacuum that Gavin Andresen left after putting Van Der Laan in change. Greg started Blockstream with Adam Back and they started paying Core developers. Those developers decided to work on Segwit almost exclusively and they pushed it despite the political backlash. This was basically a corporate takeover of Bitcoin as an open source protocol. It's been written about in several medium articles outlining what happened. Maybe you weren't here while this took place and should read back, but don't blame me for setting you straight when you don't know the history here.

> companies, miners, developers, holders, on reddit or otherwise

On reddit? r/bitcoin controlled by one guy with extreme political opinions (pro-Segwit or you get banned). Twitter? Marketing accounts of 55 yr olds that somehow love Segwit after being involved with Bitcoin for two weeks? It was an orchestrated campaign with very little if any real support. If you had been at non-Blockstream controlled conferences you would know that. Shit, even the conferences that Blockstream controlled had less than 50% Segwit support.

And the miners that supported Segwit? They were buddy-buddy with Blockstream and most likely had future plans to sell blockspace at a premium to Blockstream to facilitate an attempted monopoly over on-chain transactions.

> Segwit required 95% miner support to activate, which it clearly, objectively got. How did anyone ""force"" that to happen?

Segwit alone did not have 95% support. The 2x increase had 95% support, Segwit was a rider from small-block supporters. The fact that it activated before the 2x was a good-faith agreement of miners to attempt to end the small-block congestion. Didn't work because it turns out that Segwit was not an immediate blocksize increase as it was sold.

> A large swath of the development community contributing to Bitcoin strongly objecting to a short notice hard fork

Uh, a hard fork has been pushed for for years. May 4th, 2015: http://gavinandresen.ninja/time-to-roll-out-bigger-blocks 
Even before that, in 2013-2014 There was talk about a blocksize increase. Even Adam Back said that Bitcoin should grow via 2-4-8mb in a couple of years (which would happen right about now from the time he said it).

It's simple code that has been extremely well tested. Zcash launched with a 2mb blocksize. Hard forks have happened many times on the Ethereum network and other networks in response to needed upgrades.

> Can an elite few with a lot of power/influence within the bitcoin space force a change through without that consensus? 

An elite few? Like who? Name them. Mining is VERY decentralized. Bitmain sells miners to anyone - go buy one then you'll actually be making Bitcoin more decentralized.

And let's talk about consensus. The bullshit consensus you're talking about is created when maybe 1-3 people on Bitcoin core say, ""okay us three want this in there, let's do whatever we need to do to get in deployed"" Then they kick the dragon's den into gear spreading shit everywhere, attacking people that disagree with them, banning tens of thousands of users from r/bitcoin. That's not consensus my friend. BitcoinCore has not been about consensus after it was taking over in 2013. After Gavin left BitcoinCore could no longer be trusted to find a fair consensus. There is no consensus in core that would go against Blockstream who pays many of their salaries.

Anything is better than 1-3 core devs acting like kings controlling the Bitcoin protocol for their own profit schemes. The NYA brought together miners, business owners and users to say that yes, Bitcoin is totally fucked without larger blocks and yes, there is a small faction of miners (~30%) that want Segwit, ""or else!"". 

I would go so far as to say that 99.5% of all Bitcoin users, enthusiasts, miners (as individuals, not individual hashrate) all wanted larger blocks.

My last questions: Why were larger blocks stalled when they were proven to be safe? Who in their right mind would stall Bitcoin growth when it needs it the most? What might their motives be for doing that? Who pays them? Where is the money coming from (AXA)? Why might AXA want to stall/destroy Bitcoin (legacy banks, threatened)? Follow the money, follow the influence, follow the centralization, follow the censorship and where all of this propaganda is coming from and it will lead you to BitcoinCore, Blockstream, Greg Maxwell, Adam Back and all of the shit they have forcefully taken control of.

Don't forget, Bitcoin is open source. It used to be the case that anyone could develop for Bitcoin and in good faith worthy improvements would be added. That stopped when Gavin stepped down. It used to be a meritocracy and it quickly became filled with greedy devs who demanded ass-kissing in their quest to become Bitcoin's benevolent dictators for life. No longer was Bitcoin truly open source when those guys filled the power vacuum. They've even tried to threaten lawsuits, they've contacted the SEC to beg them to declare them the one-true-bitcoin. Please. Open your eyes.

If anyone else reads this I hope it enlightens them to how threatened Bitcoin has really been over the past three years. The fact that BitcoinCash and Bitcoin2x are succeeding shows that a small greedy group can't make a hostile takeover of Bitcoin. This proves that decentralization is possible in a system like this because the users, businesses and miners demand both decentralization of the network and decentralization of protocol development.";1;0;False;Annapurna317;doiw7uj;Just so you guys know: Ethereum just had another successful hardfork network upgrade.

">Circular logic. There's no reason for the noise. No justification for it.

2x will double all resource requirements for all nodes on the network, in addition to the growth expected through segwit adoption growth, resulting in fewer nodes, particularly in places where there already are very few (can we agree on this?). Fewer nodes is bad, and not worth the additional tx capacity increase. That's one of several justifications; you're free to disagree with it but it's a judgement based on personal values, claiming that opinion doesn't/can't exist is nonsense.

>What matters is the 0.1% that is functionally better than Bitcoin, that single competitor that can actually beat it and steal its network effects.

Innovations, improvements, optimizations are being driven all the time in Bitcoin. Increasing the block size isn't an innovation, it's throwing more resources at the problem. If anything, keeping the block size constrained creates that much *more* drive to innovate and improve (Schnorr, MAST, LN, side chains, etc). All these other coins have scaling challenges too, they're just not running into them (with exception of maybe ethereum) yet because no one uses the others for any significant volume. Furthermore, if there ever really are marked innovations in other cryptos that would improve BTC, there's still nothing to stop their incorporation.

>Because Microsoft was fundamentally better than the competition.

I may not have made my point very well here. Microsoft's ""market share"" in the internet space PLUMMETED, even as it quintupled in market cap, because it was one of a few very early entrants that opened up a space for tons of other companies to experiment and innovate through their own firms. That's not evidence at all that Microsoft somehow missed the opportunity to simultaneously also be every other dot.com company, or that the existence and rise of a new company in the space like Google shows that microsoft failed any more than Ethereum's existence shows BTC as a failure. Google/Microsoft were trying to be very different things, and each succeeded well. There were dozens or hundreds of other little entrants that fizzled out into nothing. This is likely to parallel the crypto space, the assumption that there can be only 1 winner seems strange to me.";1;1;False;Karma9000;doije1k;Just so you guys know: Ethereum just had another successful hardfork network upgrade.

>You're right that it's not an argument, it's an indisputable fact. If you disagree with that fact you don't belong in the Bitcoin space and you're basically a threat to Bitcoin and attacking it's fundamental values of decentralization.

OK, ""'X' is bad"" is also not a fact, it's the definition of an opinion. Similarly, disagreeing is also an opinion; respectfully sharing an opinion of disagreement is not an attack. That being said, I *don't disagree* with centralized control being antithetical to bitcoin and that property being what makes it valuable, I think I just disagree with your assessment that either Segwit-good, 2x-hardfork-bad is the result of any kind of command and control, centralized anything.

>I doubt 30-50 users genuinely wanted Segwit, that's the sad part - it was forced on an entire community, a silent majority, of tens of thousands.

Lauuuuugh. The referendum on Segwit already happened, and aside from the vast variety of sources (companies, miners, developers, holders, on reddit or otherwise) clearly stating support for it, the real test of user support is what the economic majority decides; BCH broke off clearly along no-segwit lines with very little volume and a stagnating market interest, while the segwit enabled chain nearly doubled in value just since august. If you want to argue all that value and volume followed the segwit chain as a result of Theymos kicking people out of some forums, go right ahead, but that's beyond enough evidence for me. Segwit is just plain a solid improvement for bitcoin now that's it's out there I invite you to demonstrate otherwise.

>controversial code with not even 30% miner support. 

Segwit required 95% miner support to activate, which it clearly, objectively got. How did anyone ""force"" that to happen?

>Secondly, mining decentralization is the only thing that matters. Nodes go on and off all of the time. Only mining nodes are real ""nodes"".

The node running in my closet might not matter to anyone but me, but it and the many other like it are also the reason a very small group of people running the relatively small number of mining nodes can't get together and unilaterally decide to change BTC into something users like me don't accept, or even be clear targets from governments or other bodies to do the same thing against their will. My node ""doesn't matter"" because it's not catching anyone cheating, because no one can cheat, because of the broad swath of decentralized nodes like mine.

>SSDs? Super fast now a days while getting larger and faster at an impressive rate.

Believe it or not, not going to argue with you here because I agree! I think a 2x increase now wouldn't in any way be the end of the network, and even the more restricting bandwidth requirements you didn't list could also (barely) handle that increase without too much risk/loss of nodes, decentralization, etc.

But the disagreement isn't limited to the technical merits, it's also about how decisions are made about protocol changes in general. A large swath of the development community contributing to Bitcoin strongly objecting to a short notice hard fork should have set off alarm bells in this proposal, and at least stalled it's progression while consensus was built for doing it (consensus from nearly everyone, not just the handful of people who run the pools that had a large share of the hash rate). But that stalling didn't happen because NYA signers were (understandably) frustrated with the pace of change, and thought they could offer some leadership to drive that agreement through, so now we're testing something else: Can an elite few with a lot of power/influence within the bitcoin space force a change through without that consensus? My money is on ""no"", and that the [economic majority will reject the change](https://www.bitfinex.com/stats) even if only on the ground of ""nowhere close to everyone was on board with this."" But I could be wrong, and if people end up rallying around the bitcoin on the B2X fork and tanking/abandoning the 1MB chain, I would definitely follow along and admit that I was wrong about the situation.";0;1;False;Karma9000;doinhdo;Just so you guys know: Ethereum just had another successful hardfork network upgrade.

"> 2x will double all resource requirements for all nodes on the network,

From $2.00 to $4.00

Or said another way, from <1 average transaction fee to <2 average transaction fees.

> resulting in fewer nodes,

There's no evidence that having more than N fullnodes is helpful ***at all*** to the network.  We don't even know what N is for that matter; As far as I can tell the network would be completely totally secure and safe with only 3000 fullnodes.

Moreover, your claim is wrong to begin with.  Increased transaction volume increases the number of fullnodes on the network.  This is empirically true [over the last year+](http://nodecounter.com/#all_nodes) (click view lifetime), it was found [in a research study](http://snap.stanford.edu/class/cs224w-2014/projects2014/cs224w-27-final.pdf), and it is empirically true for Ethereum which processes more transactions every day than Bitcoin with [2.4x the number of fullnodes](http://flippening.watch).

This would be more clear if those who tried to post the facts of the situation weren't banned from /r/Bitcoin for doing so, or have their posts ""moderated"" to the core dev email list as being ""too political.""

> particularly in places where there already are very few (can we agree on this?)

No, because it doesn't matter how few there are in a given location.  What matters is the geopolitical distribution of fullnodes and miners across the planet.  While mining is concentrating in China, that has nothing to do with the blocksize and everything to do with the economic and logistical issues at play, and the non-chinese miners are sufficient to keep the network running in the event of China going dark completely.  Node distributions have not centralized at all and spread along with the distributions of Bitcoin users.

Bitcoin will be sufficiently protected with as few as 3000 geopolitically distributed fullnodes. I challenge anyone to prove otherwise with math and game theory.

> Fewer nodes is bad, and not worth the additional tx capacity increase. 

False, more nodes does not provide any additional advantages or protections for the network.  Fewer users and lower adoption on the other hand, are devastating to the network.

> you're free to disagree with it but it's a judgement based on personal values

Holding Bitcoin's growth back because of your personal values that are not backed by math, game theory, experimental results, or research is immoral.  It literally threatens millions of peoples' investment for no purpose.

> Innovations, improvements, optimizations are being driven all the time in Bitcoin. 

lol

Bitcoin has not been innovative for several years now.

> Increasing the block size isn't an innovation, it's throwing more resources at the problem.

Yes, a problem caused by too few resources and exacerbated by a poor understanding of how Bitcoin's cost structures and uses actually function in the real world.

Not throwing resources at the problem is the equivalent of an ISP refusing to upgrade their fiber lines and bleeding customers to the competition.

>  If anything, keeping the block size constrained creates that much more drive to innovate and improve (Schnorr, MAST, LN, side chains, etc).

Yes, lets threaten the stability and growth of the entire ecosystem just so that we can punish people for not innovating the way we want!

> All these other coins have scaling challenges too, they're just not running into them (with exception of maybe ethereum) yet because no one uses the others for any significant volume. 

Ethereum has processed more transactions per day than Bitcoin every single day for the last 83 days and counting.  They hardforked yesterday and doubled their transaction capacity, without a single problem or hiccup.

Every other crypto has a solution in place to scale.  There is no scaling ""challenge"".  It is entirely made up because some people are terrified of fullnodes costing $4 per month instead of $2.

> Furthermore, if there ever really are marked innovations in other cryptos that would improve BTC, there's still nothing to stop their incorporation.

Yes there is, Bitcoin is stopping the incorporation of changes in Bitcoin right now, today, right now, what you are doing.  What Bitcoin *can* do means *nothing* if it **refuses to actually do it**.

> There were dozens or hundreds of other little entrants that fizzled out into nothing. This is likely to parallel the crypto space, the assumption that there can be only 1 winner seems strange to me.

Crypto space is a network effect.  You can only pay or be paid Bitcoins to someone else who uses/wants Bitcoins.  You can only add a friendster comment to someone else's profile when they are **on friendster.**  Every single person Bitcoin sends from friendster to Facebook is another dagger pointed at its heart.  Why did Google plus fail to dent Facebook?  Because overcoming a network effect is extremely hard to do.  If Bitcoin simply didn't fuck shit up, it would be very difficult for any altcoin to overtake it.  But sending all your users to the altcoins?  Arranging things so the altcoins are cheaper and easier to use?  Yeah, that might do it.  And until you reach the tipping point, you have no idea how screwed you are.  Once it tips, you can't reverse the trend.  Myspace will never recover from losing 99% of its' users to Facebook.

"> There is no definitive blocksize threshold that just immediately creates ""centralization"" within the network.

well duh.  that's why it's ridiculous to leave it capped at the same 1MB level since 2010.  and even more ridiculous when tech improves every year making your increasing centralization theory not a given.

>Maybe you like a model where bitcoin users have to rely on large centralized entities to interact with the network.

lol, are you kidding me?  with you and your hub and spoke centralization model to connect individual users in LN?  gimme a break.

>But I prefer bitcoin to be decentralized, trustless, and peer to peer.

so will i.  and that means continuing with the model that's brought Bitcoin to where it is today.  onchain scaling which is proven with a track record.  not some Rube Goldberg that exists in your mind.

>What does pruning have to do with bandwidth usage? Are you even aware of what pruning is?

lol, talking with you is talking to an idiot.  you said this:

that's why i brought up pruning in regards to storage.  when you want to stop driveling talking points out of your mouth w/o forgetting what you've said, please let me know.";1;1;False;H0dl;dojirhh;Just so you guys know: Ethereum just had another successful hardfork network upgrade.

"> Tell me at what blocksize that is?

There is no definitive blocksize threshold that just immediately creates ""centralization"" within the network.  It's a sliding scale.  The larger the blocks, the more concentrated nodes and mining becomes.  The larger the blocks, the less number of people can actually validate their own payments.  They'll need to rely on third parties for that.

Maybe you like a model where bitcoin users have to rely on large centralized entities to interact with the network.  But I prefer bitcoin to be decentralized, trustless, and peer to peer.  So I'll fight to keep it that way.
