"Not necessarily.

1) If I understand correctly, they commit to instantly buy the BCH from their business with USD cash from their personal accounts, so there is no capital gain or loss to report on their business taxes. (They are the kind of people who believe in the project and actually want Bitcoin for themselves, so that works nicely for some people.)

2) If you prefer to just cash out into USD right away, using BitPay will let you do that for a 1% fee instantly. Again, no capital gain or loss to report if I understand correctly. You can effectively accept BCH but receive dollars if that's your preference.

3) It's really not hard to use software to track your net gains/losses and cost basis on Bitcoin if you are actively trading in and out of it with USD. This is especially easy if you use something like Coinbase, but there are plenty of third party solutions these days. It's no harder than the tracking your stock trades or rebalances.

"Ah, I am the OP :)

I'm a small business owner and freelancer myself, so my taxes are already fairly complex, so I don't mind. 

But even if I wasn't, everything from answer #3 still applies. It's really just not that hard to automatically track those things these days!

If you're savvy, I imagine you can even intelligently use tax loss harvesting by trading cryptos when they're all down to lower your tax burden, so there are potential pluses there too.

But I'd also imagine that many crypto users aren't going to bother reporting, just like most waiters' tips went largely unreported for most of modern history until pretty recently.

I can understand that. On a moral level, income and capital gains taxes are forceful, unnecessary, corrosive, and shouldn't exist. (But I still pay them anyway as a prudential matter, because for me, the costs of not doing so would be far higher than I'm willing to bear.) 

This all goes doubly so when we're talking about so-called ""gains"" on forms of money, and it's nice to see that some states are already introducing legislation to remove capital gains on gold and silver. The same should be done for cryptocurrencies.

In the meantime, no, I'm no more concerned about it than I am concerned about reporting my stock trades. It's all pretty easily and automatically tracked these days.";1;0;False;fossiltooth;dvjw7l2;Just bought a rack of ribs using Bitcoin Cash.;https://i.redd.it/mw8r0q4bk7l01.jpg
"It could also be subject to a capital loss if you were to make a purchase when cryptos were down, no?

I've heard that cryptos are not subject to wash sale rules, which would mean that using the ""spend and replace"" strategy when cryptos are down could potentially *save* you in taxes by allowing you to declare losses--even if your effective position size in BCH remains the same.

I imagine it might also might be a good strategy to trade out of one type of crypto into another when they're both down, thereby harvesting a tax loss that you can use to offset other passive income. (If so, it could be a great time to switch from BTC to BCH if you're in the red, or otherwise diversify your holdings.)

Ultimately, there should be no capital gains taxes on currencies, whether fiat or crypto or precious metals, so I'm glad to see those laws being proposed. (Ideally, there's be no capital gains or income taxes, period, like for most of American history, but hey, I'll take one small victory at a time.)

In the meantime, tax loss harvesting seems like a potential silver lining.

I'd want to  check with a tax attorney first, but it's worth exploring. Even if you had to wait a 30 day period to avoid wash sale rules, it could be a sensible strategy in a bear market where you expect the trend to be down or flat for a while. But I don't think that waiting period currently applies to cryptos.

"That's u/Ant-n's point, though - since BCH did not exist before August 2017, you were not able to buy coins that are now already more than one year old.

However, I'm wondering how BCH coins which you receive from holding BTC throughout the fork are being taxed. I assume the purchase date relevant to this is the purchase date of the original BTC?";2;1;False;polarito;dvjta1x;Largest delivery service in germany now accepting BCH via bitpay.

"> Then only spend your old coins and keep the young ones to ""mature"", problem solved.

If you're doing fifo (first in, first out) to determine the age of the sold coins, then that works only as long as you don't day-trade too much. If you ""flip"" all your coins within a year due to trading, they will never age to > 1 year. So if your yearly trading volume exceeds your holdings (and that's not very to hard achieve if you're trying to run a profit), you're fucked.";1;0;False;moleccc;dvkdcry;Largest delivery service in germany now accepting BCH via bitpay.

"> However, I'm wondering how BCH coins which you receive from holding BTC throughout the fork are being taxed.

Look at it like a stock split: the date of acquisition is the date of the acquisition of the prefork coin. Price of acquisition is the ""first market price"", about €260 for BCH (incidentally BTC dropped by roughly that amount at fork point).

Technically it would be even more accurate to take the acquisition price of the pre-fork coin and ""distribute"" that to the 2 post-fork coins using the ratio of the market prices at fork time, but I think the first method will be acceptable to the taxman and it's advantageous to have a higher acquisition price for the BTC, of course.";4;0;False;moleccc;dvkd820;Largest delivery service in germany now accepting BCH via bitpay.
