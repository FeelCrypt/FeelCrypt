"What about BCHSV? This argument is dead. 

The market is raping BCH vs BTC. BTC is bitcoin. Sorry guys. You picked the wrong coin. ";2;0;False;Spartacus_Nakamoto;eark0lk;When you have Bitcoin in your mind 24/7;a1fsjl;https://i.redd.it/zhzn6hg5l8121.jpg

"I'll try to provide a diplomatic answer.

The original ""Bitcoin"" has gone through several ""forks"" over the years (where one project splits into two competing versions).  ""Bitcoin Cash"" (ticker symbol BCH) is one such forked version.  What is commonly called ""Bitcoin"" today (ticker symbol BTC) is another competing version.

Many supporters of both versions consider their preferred version to be ""the original Bitcoin"".  The split was controversial, and happened for reasons of differing philosophy.  Be warned, because there is passion on both sides, the arguments can get heated.

The basic philosophical difference is that the BCH camp typically feels that Bitcoin's ""blocks"" should be gradually increased in size so that more and more people can conduct cheap, fast, secure transactions on the block chain itself (because they think the value of Bitcoin is in people's ability to actually use it for transactions).  The BTC camp typically feels that Bitcoin's ""blocks"" should be kept small (usually at a max of 1MB) so that more people can afford the necessary hardware to run a so-called ""full node"" (because they see this as highly important for preserving Bitcoin's decentralisation), and that new ""off chain"" solutions should be invented for doing day-to-day transactions.

Also, a footnote, despite the name of this subreddit, most people chatting in here lean towards the BCH philosophy (including myself).

Hope that helps.";1;2;False;fatalglory;ear11hq;When you have Bitcoin in your mind 24/7;a1fsjl;https://i.redd.it/zhzn6hg5l8121.jpg
