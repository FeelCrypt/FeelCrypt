"> But, this is an argument over semantics. No one “stole” the name from anyone. That is a fact.

No, the person you replied to has it right. Core stole the name, and that is the actual historical fact. Core is the core of Bitcoin because Core says so - not because users agreed, not because miners approved; simply because it has been asserted with dominance and defended with unrestrained technique (sans regard for honesty or common good). Demand for a block size limit increase existed in 2014 - before SegWit had been *conceived*! - and even then, developers that were so bold as to present *proof of concept code* for a capacity improvement were branded as ""dangerous to Bitcoin"". Code that would only allow larger blocks if 75% of the last difficulty adjustment's blocks signaled support for larger blocks was the tipping point for what would later become Core: branded a ""dangerous altcoin fork that threatens Bitcoin"", Bitcoin XT and its developers (having already been expelled from the bitcoin-qt development process for their heresy of supporting a larger capacity limit) were forever branded as Attackers, and joined the ever-increasing ranks of ex-Bitcoin-supporters. Consider a scenario in which Bitcoin XT was adopted by miners enough for such a majority of signaling - at this stage, bitcoin-qt would no longer define Bitcoin, and its development team would no longer control it. Such hostile resistance is predictable with clear hindsight. Still, some changes would help prevent such a situation in the future, and soon bitcoin-qt would become Bitcoin Core - a change in more than name: the development policy of permissionless participation would be the primary victim.

Since then, r\/bitcoin has announced and enforced a strict censorship policy against all development proposals and the dev mailing list is read-only for non-Core participants. The BIP process has been changed from a public review to a private one involving a few specific decision-making individuals. If you don't agree with Core, your idea isn't Bitcoin, period. [This is how it has been since 2015](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3h9cq4/its_time_for_a_break_about_the_recent_mess/). It was *decreed*, not *agreed*, what defines Bitcoin - and those who *were* using Bitcoin were told ""if you don't like it don't use Bitcoin, or make your own fork"".

**So we did.** With the help of many prominent members of the ex-Bitcoin community, Bitcoin Cash became a reality two years after that linked post, and a year of all-out internet war against Bitcoin Cash and its supporters was the reaction. It is eerily like the early attacks on Bitcoin when it began to gain traction - all the same techniques, all the same mockeries, all the same projections. ""Bitcoin Is A Scam"", they used to say. ""Bitcoin is just a way for people smarter than you to steal your money."" On one screen running a DDoS against block-producing nodes, and on the other posting to social media that ""Bitcoin is a pyramid scheme with miners at the top.""

Bitcoin Cash - a scam? Is Roger smarter than you? Does Jihan operate a pyramid scheme? Or is it just that Bitcoin Cash is that same existential threat to global money interests that Bitcoin was in 2013? I cannot decide this for anyone but myself; I can only present evidence to support my argument.

It's destroying their prophets...I mean profits.  I never put anything into BTC from the time I got into crypto because I thought it was one of the shittiest in 2013 with all the alts starting.  Needless to say, I'm glad I didn't.  Wasn't interested in Bitcoin, itself, at the time because of throughput.  Alts had it stomped when they were coming out.
