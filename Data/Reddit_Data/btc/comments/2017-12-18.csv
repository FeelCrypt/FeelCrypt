No.  Ownership of BTC on Jan 1 does *not* mean you are awarded BCH.  The August 1 hard fork date, and specifically ownership of BTC prior to the actual forked block entitle BTC holders to BCH 1:1.  The significance of early January is that Coinbase is expected to release the BCH to which certain account holders were entitled dating back to the August 1 fork.  What we are *hoping* is that Coinbase will add BCH functionality so that account holders can trade it and hold accounts on their site, as they have done already for ETH and LTC.

He should be working hard to implement segwit so that the blocksize could increase instead of working against bitcoin. ;-3;0;False;organicmingle;drfapz0;I'm Roger Ver, CEO of Bitcoin.com and world's first investor in Bitcoin startups.

"> Has anyone reviewed or audited the source code of any BCH wallets? If so, how can we confident that they have? Even if the wallet is open source, how do we know that the executable was compiled from the code on Github? Which wallet is safest for off-line storage?

Let's say you have a private key that controls both BTC and BCH with the same key. In that case you should first move all BTC to a new address with the BTC wallet app that you already trust and after that move has had at least 1 confirmation on the BTC network, you could swipe (better) or import that private key into your BCH wallet that you don't trust as much.

"1) Why do you think is there so much divisiveness between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash supporters, and do you think there is a chance both can coexist?

2) when either Bitcoin supporters claim they care about ""decentralization"" I feel there is an elephant in the room: a minuscule percentage of users own almost all the Bitcoin, making Bitcoin wealth even less evenly distributed than fiat. On top of it, the market being highly speculative, only the wealthy can afford to buy it at the moment given the risk. How do you think Bitcoin adoption can ever become mainstream if only a select handful can afford to own it (or got lucky and have a ridiculous amount)?

I'm from India and I'm excited about any cryptocurrency that offers cheap, premissionless, and fast cross-border transactions because of the strict currency conversion laws here. I'd like to spend my crypto rather than just hold it.

The problem in India is that we end up paying a 5% mark-up when buying into most cryptocurrencies which means that spending it costs us more than a paypal transaction. What do you see as the solution for emerging countries like India to gain equal-price-access to cryptocurrencies, because right now we're being price-gouged by middle-men.

"Hi Roger, thank you for doing this, much appreciated. Got a couple questions, feel free to answer none, some or all of them :)

1. What are your thoughts on the new address format that BCH will be adopting? Do you think this format is sufficient in the longterm for mainstream adoption or can you see us altering it further?

2. Do you have an update on when we can expect to be able to purchase BCH through bitcoin.com(with fiat)? I gather it was delayed due to your liquidity provider taking longer than you initially thought.

3. Do you have information about what (1) the fees will be on the BCH debit card and (2) whether it will instantly convert the balance to fiat upon funding, or if you will be able to hold BCH on it until you actually purchase a good or service?

4. With the re-enabling of op codes in BCH, do you have any example of what possibilities will be opened up? Personally I would like to see BCH focus on being the best form of money and so if it enables any advanced monetary features then I'm all for it.

5. Are you currently planning on implementing Cash-shuffle into the bitcoin cash wallet?

6. What are your thoughts on how we can make 0-conf better and more usable for merchants and consumers alike? Linking to this, do you have an opinion on the purposed idea of 'sub-chains'?

"Roger,

Thanks for all the work you've done for the crypto space, it's people like you that are really giving life to this new technology.

My question is about the fungibility of BCH. This seems to be one of the biggest flaws with BCH as a cash system. The technology is designed around tracking property, and while it doesn't have to be tied to a specific person's identity, the majority of places to buy BCH (and other cryptos) require bank account #'s, phone verification, and picture ID's. 

So, what are the best solutions in the near future for improving BCH's anonymity? Is it possible to have true anonymity on this particular chain? How important do you consider fungibility in the grand scheme of BCH?

"Roger, Thanks for doing this. I've been a long time fan of yours, I'm sorry for all the troll hate you get. Honestly, 99% of trolls can't even spell trolls. 

In the current situation 

* high fees
* Political grid lock 
* how people view the goal (ie. gold)
* What's the real BTC coin....(this is nearly a waste of argument and time I think)


I should first say, you're 100% right the coin was meant as a cash system. However, limit supply among an increasing price makes that quite difficult to understand the value of goods. 

Here my questions, 

1. Would you be ok with making BTC a store of value and not a payment based system?
2.Picking a different coin as a payment system?
3. Would you be ok with, LTC a payment coin as it will be easy to have atomic swaps, low fee's, and even a faster payment process?
 
I think LTC is interesting, as it's not hard to a) convert a payment system over to LTC as it shares a large amount of code b) It doesn't come with the political issues of which is the real BTC. 


Finally, what's the biggest lesson you learned in life?

I use coinpayments.net but their point of sales solution is unacceptable for brick-and-mortar stores because it is extremely slow and I haven't found a different solution.  The bitcoin.com wallet is excellent especially in the area of 0-conf transactions as brick and mortar locations need to detect the full payment in seconds.  The characteristics of a Point Of Sales solution that I am looking for is as follows:
-Enter sales price in USD
-detects 0-conf transaction as fast as possible
-option to open without authentication only to accept payment (so employees could accept payment but not send)

"1)  We all agree that BCH most fits Satoshi‚Äôs definition of Bitcoin.  Bitcoin.com should be promoting mainly the real bitcoin, not the store-of-value Bitcoin.  When do you plan to explain to readers about the difference between BCH and BTC and why Bitcoin.com will be dedicated to the Bitcoin that adheres to Satoshi‚Äôs definition of Bitcoin?

2)  If you do #1, then you should also explain to readers the history of Bitcoin‚Äôs scaling debate, in-fighting and eventual divorce into BCH and BTC (https://medium.com/@curt0/bitcoin-divorce-bitcoin-legacy-vs-bitcoin-cash-explained-31a1f147527d).  Because of this divorce, BTC holders will come to Bitcoin.com to troll and bash on the commenting section.  If newbies understand the history and divorce, then they will understand why trolls are bashing BCH.  Otherwise, they might think that there is legitimate criticism towards BCH.

3)  One of the promises of Bitcoin was to be able use a trust-less currency.  However, users need to trust wallets.

There are news about scam wallets that are stealing coins, such as the mybtgwallet (Bitcoin Gold) and Coinpouch wallets.  They blamed Bitcoingold.org for publishing a link to the scam wallet and for not having audited the wallet beforehand.  Has anyone reviewed or audited the source code of any BCH wallets?

"The following is from Bitcoin core's website itself regarding possible detriments of Segwit in relation to it increasing bitcoin's blocksize:

""Risks due to larger blocks:

*Larger blocks will result in higher resource requirements for full nodes, potentially causing users to shut down their nodes, which would result in higher centralisation. 

The negative impact of larger blocks is limited in a number of ways:

*Pruning support allows users to run full nodes without storing the entire history of the blockchain, which allows users who have constrained storage resources to continue running full nodes, even with a larger block size.""

Is ""pruning"" feasible and if so, assuming its also available for Bitcoin Cash, will this greatly diminish centralization of BCH even as blocks get very large as it scales?

"Question regarding fees on BCH:
Transaction fee is defined as per byte and in satoshis , yes? 

So now with 125 bytes transaction - minimal fee (that is nonzero) is 125 satoshis per tx. 

With the price of BCH say $2000 it is 125/(100 000 000) * 2000 = $0,0025

I mean - if the price of the coin will go up, won't fees go up accordingly.  Only because 1 satoshi / byte is the minimal fee that user can enter into the wallet.

"hello  roger thanks for moving us forward....fielding so many interssting questions with so many interesting replies over the space of 2+ hours....

for the first hour, it was obvious that u had to summon extra brain power to pull out the correct suffix viz ""core"" from your memory cells, when u needed to refer to bitcoin-btc.

i propose that if u start using btc for core , btc will roll off your tongue so much more easily...with no extra brain-power required !!

also it gives the ecosystem  a certain symmetry where we might expect greg, adam or luke sporting  a t-shirt with ""BTC PLZ"" splashed across the front

also on your wallet it would be so much easier for noobs if they see ""bitcoin-bch [cash]"" and ""bitcoin-btc [core]"" instead of bitcoins-cash & core

bear in mind that indoctrinated reddit users and legacy media users never encounter the word bitcoin-core and can be easily confused ......thinking ....what's this!!  maybe it's roger's own altcoin...!

"Roger!

Firstly, you've gotten flack from some of your comments/actions.  I mean, considering your moniker, just ask yourself, WWJD?  Then breathe, and remember, I'm asking myself, WWBJD?  /commafail

And, mainly, have you seriously considered the implications of Bitcoin Cash being a payment competitor for the streaming/web donation space?  Compare BCH fees to Patreon.  Also, this is a space that requires public education, and you're essentially using the streamers as self-interested BCH-amabassadors.  I think we'd need a document that went over the basics of security, usage, and like some sort of mechanism for ""technical support"".

I'm fairly confident I'm not the person to do this.  But, if I don't see my Tesla streamers giving an option to donate in BCH I'm going to cry.  I mean, think of people who stream content that wants to change the world for the better with their wealth and not lambos/hookers/blow.

**Edit:** It appears this is [**the address**](https://i.imgur.com/4urptkf.png) of the private key [**you displayed**](https://i.imgur.com/7McRquK.png) on your stream: 1D2XPosipe9kGLwsd1uXdDy2gGTqojWC5c

I'd like to look at the amount of inputs. You seem to not be aware that lack of signature aggregation (Schnorr) is an issue for both chains.

Are you aware of the solutions that the developers are working on for this?

You've repeatedly offered approved submitter status as a counter to people interviewing/questioning you complaining they can only make 1 post every 10 minutes. I've yet to be given this, and it makes it very difficult for me to engage with members of this community when 10 people can respond to me in that time frame and I can only respond back once, and only after 10 minutes.

So can I have approved submitter status?

Also, you blocked me on Twitter for ""[**spreading lies**](https://i.imgur.com/pgJ20Nv.png)"", but you never clarified what lies I was spreading. You did this after a week of me posting useful information for the community under your tweets, which makes me feel like you only blocked me because you didn't like it.

Can you clarify on the lies, or unblock me on Twitter?

"What are your thoughts on implementing an industry-wide, cogent and sensible marketing strategy for Bitcoin Cash?

- Make 'Bits' the standard denomination for Bitcoin Cash. 1 bit = 100 satoshi's.
- We change the Bitcoin Cash colour to green everywhere.
- bit value used as standard on all exchanges so 1 bit = $0.002.
- Ticker is changed from BCH (created by Core supporters) to CSH.

&nbsp;

This will require a lot of organising behind the scenes but I think it is possible. We have a chance right now while the industry is still young, small and disorganised to implement this. Once we grow, it will never change again.

&nbsp;

This will achieve a number of things:

1. There will no longer be the argument that Bitcoin Cash is 'expensive'. In fact it will seem 'cheap' using the same psychology.
2. People will understand that the smallest unit you can is very small (many people think you can only buy 1 BCH).
3. By using green industry-wide we will have unified branding that represents cash.
4. With CSH our ticker will no longer sound like bitch, and won't have been given to us by core supporters. It will sound like Cash which is what Bitcoin Cash is.";2;1;False;singularity87;drfb0ex;I'm Roger Ver, CEO of Bitcoin.com and world's first investor in Bitcoin startups.

"BCH follows the actual definition of Satoshi's vision closer than BTC, this is correct. With that said, why do you think it has to be such a battle between yourself and the Bitcoin core team and the BCH contingent you are a part of?

i don't expect you to ever admit it, but it's obvious that you're trying to co-opt the Bitcoin brand because you disagree with the core team. It seems to me that the support of BCH is lower than it could be because people don't trust you. This is due to the bitcoin.com wallet suggesting BCH is BTC, contentious hard forks, and your general attitude towards the core team. Would you ever step away from the BCH project if it was apparent that you were hurting it's reputation?

The following is from Bitcoin core's website itself regarding possible detriments of Segwit in relation to it lowering fees:

https://bitcoincore.org/en/2016/10/28/segwit-costs/

""Risks due to lower fees:
The security of the Bitcoin blockchain is provided by hashpower, which is rewarded by both a fixed block reward and by fees from individual transactions. As a result, decreases in fee income have the potential to reduce the hashpower used to mine Bitcoin, which in turn may lower the security of the Bitcoin blockchain.

In so far as the individual transaction fees are determined by market forces and supply and demand, the changes introduced by segwit may risk lowering prices by increasing supply (presuming that demand does not also rise, either because of or at least concurrent with segwit deployment), and lower individual prices may result in lower overall mining revenue (if the price elasticity of demand is in the inelastic range).

In addition, the changes made in segwit may make ‚Äúlayer two‚Äù solutions, such as the Lightning Network, more compelling. If this leads to users treating layer two solutions as a substitute for on-chain transactions, this may significantly decrease demand for on-chain transactions, which would put additional downward pressure on transaction fee levels.

Avoidance
Fees are currently approximately 0.5 BTC per block versus 12.5 BTC per block from the block subsidy, or about 4% of miner income, so the potential impact on miner income and hence network security is likely small in the short term.

In addition, fees have been rising over the past twelve months both in BTC denominated value (from under 0.2 BTC per block a year ago) and in real terms (from under $300 USD per BTC a year ago, to over $600 USD per BTC today), so moderate falls in fee levels will only be equivalent to reverting to fee incomes from up to twelve months ago, which should not be a major impact.""

https://fork.lol/ shows that currently BTC fees are ~19% of miner income as opposed to 4% quoted here. Also it shows the ratio of mining profitability between BTC and BCH is within 10%. 

1. What predicitions would you make long term given Core's concern and this data? 

2. Do you think BCH will substantially gain increasing share of hashing power as fees drop when BTC does implement Lightning Network and/or use of Segwit?

"> Why not hold on to btc until transactions get situated?

Many of us who have examined the technicals of Lightning are not convinced that it will ever be able to do what it has promised.

How long are you willing to wait. In the worst case, BTC has bet *EVERYTHING* on lightning, and if it failed, that could set crypto back years.

Instead, who who doubt Lightning simply forked and kept building on the original bitcoin trajectory. Because it was working and it's still working, and will continue working for a long damn time to come.
