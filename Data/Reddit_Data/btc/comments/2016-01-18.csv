"> perhaps to an extent lacks the maturity to interpret the code

Sorry but honestly, this is such bullshit. The arguments are not about some arcane details of the code that only Jedi masters can understand.

It's about whether you believe enough hobbyists with low bandwidth connections and no budget for a few disks can prevent a government attack on bitcoin. The entire core dev position derives from the claim that even slightly increasing node cost will cause an unacceptable security risk, and that it's worth refusing new customers wanting to use the service in order to protect this. Most people just don't support this view, and in fact find it ludicrous.

I think it derives from a deep distrust of corporations, the fear that if any corporation gets involved the whole thing will get corrupted. My guess is people who have worked in responsible companies have a more balanced view that yes there are some Enrons but mostly corporations are not so mysterious. And furthermore, when put into a competitive ecosystem, like airlines or automobiles or internet search engines or whatever (bitcoin mining! or bitcoin node operation!) that the result is quite robust and stable on the whole. And delivers much value to people.";5;1;False;sandball;cz307sw;Some advice for everybody at this point in time;41ipkd;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/41ipkd/some_advice_for_everybody_at_this_point_in_time/
"Yup, hardforks are an attack vector.  If we fork for 2mb, then what's next?  Who's gonna drive the next so called community consensus to fork to destroy satoshis coins, increase the mining reward or allow better coin tracking?    I've heard tons of bad ideas floated around that could be twisted as a good thing from the myopic masses.

The stupidest thing about forking for 2mb is the risk/reward.   All we get is twice the capacity.  That's it.  We risk the entire network fracturing over a small capacity boost.   We'll probably fill that capacity within 6 months and then what?   Another fork?  The easier these things are, the easier the network can be compromised.  If this fork succeeds without a hitch, then we're proving the attack vector and it is only a matter of time before the 21m coin limit will be lifted.    We all know that  'common knowledge' says deflationary currencies can't work.   

There is a tiny fraction of people who believe deflationary currency is the best feature of bitcoin, just wait until the masses decide they want to change that.";-2;3;False;pizzaface18;cz2tn78;Some advice for everybody at this point in time;41ipkd;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/41ipkd/some_advice_for_everybody_at_this_point_in_time/

"Thanks for the clarification.

I respect what you've accomplished and there is much to like about your post.  I worry though that this latest development in the block size ""debate"" is a mostly an ill informed revolt based on a community that has seen too much censorship (inexcusable) and perhaps to an extent lacks the maturity to interpret the code, the dynamism of this system and the forces at play.

I have seen this same group claim that an opt-in feature meant primarily to be used by programs will ""break instant transactions"" that never were secure in the first place.  I've seen issues similarly propagandized and misrepresented to drive this revolution.

A few days ago Mike Hearn left [blaming the low block size on a majority of miners being behind the great firewall of China and them being at capacity, yet his solution was to dramatically increase the block size and therefore the bandwidth requirements](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/41fn73/mike_hearns_inconsistencies_with_respect_to_block/) and a hard fork.  Despite his defection to work with a group of central bankers, I'm pretty sure you'd agree these are the people this system is meant to disrupt and who would gladly see it's demise, within just a few days the same group of XT supporters are now backing another hard fork only this time with a mere 2x multiplier instead of 8x.  So safer but safer is not necessarily safe.  No acknowledgement that your former leader is now working for the competition?  Imagine the uproar if he simply switched to working on litecoin.

As I understand it though and I don't claim to speak for them, core's philosophy for scale is to ensure the base is solid, like TCP/IP, then to build on top of that.  This seems prudent as ""redefining the protocol"" so to speak poses more risk.  This philosophy respects and appreciates that this is a first of it's kind system and takes nothing for granted.  This seems prudent IMO.

Also, what about continuity?  Who is qualified to continue to develop the code if the core developers don't want to clean up the mess that may result?  Anyone can change a few lines of code, but can they safely maintain very complex code that is constantly being probed for security holes, DDoSed and has it's own very complex game mechanics?  Core has been doing this for many years already and has a proven track record.  Are the ""classic"" developers up to the task?

This seems like a very risky approach.

I also think that even if there is a degree of success, doing a contentious hard fork like this sets a template for future attack.  Scenario: Governments demands black listing and forces known regulated players to comply.  Without a contentious hard fork in history the claim can be made that it may destroy the system and the full economics of all the players can and likely would push back.  If this ""succeeds"" as in doesn't destroy bitcoin, that hand is effectively folded. Governments would quite happily exert their control if the only price to pay was a half collapse of this system and the plausible deniability of their culpability already had precedent. ""It didn't destroy bitcoin before...""

Finally, a failure of bitcoin like this would also make it hard for a future improved version to succeed as it would have to overcome the negative perceptions.  It would be far better for bitcoin to be competed out of existence than for it to fail and then another to emerge.

Are you focusing on the election and not on the aftermath?  I don't want to be right about this, I want to be wrong that ""bitcoin"" whatever it becomes after this ""vote"" will be anti-fragile enough to survive, but I can't help but think that this is a big mistake that will be clear in hindsight.

Edit: compare this to the drumbeat of ""2MB now!"", ""change the constant"": [The scaling announcement bitcoin core should have made](https://medium.com/@ryanshea/the-scaling-announcement-bitcoin-core-should-have-made-146790f755df#.siuth18ip).

"> It's about whether you believe enough hobbyists with low bandwidth connections and no budget for a few disks can prevent a government attack on bitcoin. 

Hobbyists?

From Mike Hearn's now famous ""T[he resolution of the Bitcoin experiment"" post:](https://medium.com/@octskyward/the-resolution-of-the-bitcoin-experiment-dabb30201f7#.b92939ia9)

""The reason the true limit seems to be 700 kilobytes instead of the theoretical 1000 is that sometimes miners produce blocks smaller than allowed and even empty blocks, despite that there are lots of transactions waiting to confirm — this seems to be most frequently caused by interference from the Chinese “Great Firewall” censorship system. More on that in a second.""

""Because the block chain is controlled by Chinese miners, just two of whom control more than 50% of the hash power. At a recent conference over 95% of hashing power was controlled by a handful of guys sitting on a single stage. The miners are not allowing the block chain to grow.""

""And the final reason is that the Chinese internet is so broken by their government’s firewall that moving data across the border barely works at all, with speeds routinely worse than what mobile phones provide.""

""Right now, the Chinese miners are able to — just about — maintain their connection to the global internet""
So, established by Mike: Chinese miners are currently the largest players, at least 50% of the mining power and they have limited bandwidth which is barely able to operate at current capacity. What is his solution?:

""In August 2015 it became clear that due to severe mismanagement, the “Bitcoin Core” project that maintains the program that runs the peer-to-peer network wasn’t going to release a version that raised the block size limit. The reasons for this are complicated and discussed below. But obviously, the community needed the ability to keep adding new users. So some long-term developers (including me) got together and developed the necessary code to raise the limit. That code was called BIP 101 and we released it in a modified version of the software that we branded Bitcoin XT.""

"I for one don't want developers to disappear, and I certainly don't want Classic to be the new incumbent. What I really want is for the developers that work on Bitcoin to realise that they don't get the final say. Instead they treat users as something that they can play with and exploit for their own ends and people are very rightly sick of being treated like they are dumb and have no say. Often the devs response is some kind of my-way-or-the-highway reaction which completely undermines Bitcoin's foundations and the confidence in Bitcoin as a network. Bitcoin isn't built on devs backs, it's built on the users that *use Bitcoin*, Bitcoin could still run with 10 good devs and service 100,000,000 users, but it wouldn't matter how many devs you have if the user base shinks to a couple hundred.

The developers that have positions of influence in Bitcoin development have gone to great effort to gain that influence and it has utterly corrupted their understanding of where they stand in the Bitcoin community. They are not judges or referees that get to make the final call. That's the miners', and the community's job. This is the true definition of a decentralised network that devs like Greg, btcdrak, Adam, et al. harp on about (which is incredibly ironic considering how they are trying so hard to force everyone to stick with Core BTW).

"Great post Rick. 

In the end, [Bitcoin is a representative form of government](https://medium.com/@riprowan/bitcoin-is-government-a7fd3d93e8aa) with each codebase serving as a political platform for its constituency. A Bitcoin hard fork is a ""no confidence"" vote in leadership.

The linked article makes the claim that Bitcoin produces a winner-take-all outcome which makes it a First Past the Post election. However I think you raise an interesting point: if multiple parties create compatible implementations they can form a coalition government (ie if one party accepts 2MB and another has no limit, they can create a coalition government up to 2MB - their code produces an emergent coalition bound by a smart contract to dissolve if the 2MB limit is hit).

Once we start to view the entire process through the lens of representative government then a lot of things become clear, most importantly the vitriol. Partisans always use hyperbole ""if the other guys win the election the whole country is going to collapse"" and yet elections happen all over the world and representative governments seem quite stable overall.  ""If the other guy wins that's it for me, I'm leaving the country!"" but the partisans never leave. Etc. 

I think it's important for us older dudes (like you I've been a programmer for over 30 years) to bring political level-headedness to the discussion. The sky is NOT going to fall if the other party gets elected. In fact elections and change of leadership make the whole system far more robust than a fixed leadership. Change is messy but ~~healthy~~ essential for a healthy system. A Bitcoin that can't hard fork is doomed. 

I look forward to the world post fork. I'm very optimistic that after Bitcoin has demonstrated its ability to fork in the best interests of the economic majority this will be understood as a major victory for Bitcoin - arguably the most important victory to date and a great reason to invest in money that is controlled by the economic majority, not special interests.

"Just one comment. You say that segwit is Core's solution to scaling and that it is probably bad to use this instead of a one-liner to increase the capacity. But remember that segwit is mainly a fix for transaction malleability, which has been a thorn in the eye of bitcoin for far too long. So it should be implemented regardless. If so, it is actually the fork that introduced the most new code: Both should implement segwit sooner or later but classic is proposing a hardforked block limit *in addition* to that.

"> In the end, Bitcoin is a representative form of government with each codebase serving as a political platform for its constituency. A Bitcoin hard fork is a ""no confidence"" vote in leadership.

Yes, an attempt at hardforking is _precisely_ a vote of no confidence. This is not technical, this is entirely social.

> However I think you raise an interesting point: if multiple parties create compatible implementations they can form a coalition government

Isn't this an interesting scenario? Bitcoin Unlimited, for example, has an excellent selling point that it will cooperate with anything and anybody. That idea hadn't even occurred before.

> I think it's important for us older dudes (like you I've been a programmer for over 30 years) to bring political level-headedness to the discussion.

Maybe we're just reacting with a ""yeah, I've seen this play out before, like a hundred or so times"" :D and can keep our cool in a way that people who have Bitcoin as their first project just can't relate to. If that's the case, then as you say, it's almost a responsibility to be the slow and thoughtful speaker in the room.

"First of all, can we please move away from the crazy idea that consensus rules are somehow voted on and determined by the longest chain? Users choose some set of consensus rules (based on what they personally like and the sets of rules others are using) and then follow the transaction history with the most amount of work.


> When proponents of Core's scaling tell me that Option Two here is the better because it's safer, and I try to comprehend that statement, I am either utterly insane or the statement is the equivalent of ""black is white and up is down"".

You missed the third option, that you don't understand the major risk of people losing their money during a hardfork where both sides have a significant amount of hashing power. 

> When I try to understand more and challenge the assertion that option two is safer - on what I must say are very good grounds - I'm told that I should be leaving design to the experts and that I don't understand enough of the complex machine that is bitcoin.

This is in sharp contrast with my personal experience, but might be more true in the current aggressive climate. There has been so much discussion on all of these topics that you should at least be able to understand the arguments of your personal ""the other side"". 

> What I see is instead engineering for the sake of engineering.

Oh come on. Calling a ~5x speedup on signature validation, one of the major bottlenecks of actually scaling bitcoin, engineering for the sake of engineering is borderline insulting.
