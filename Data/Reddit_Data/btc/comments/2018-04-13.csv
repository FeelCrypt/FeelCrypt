"> Perhaps the top priority for the Bitcoin Cash community should be to find a replacement for reddit. It doesn't have to be fully peer to peer or decentralised, but a forum which had a different approach to community moderation might be a help.

A system called Politeia is being built to replace Reddit.

Communication software suitable for serious open governance process must satisfy requirements I covered in detail [here](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/ZcashFoundation/issues/58#issuecomment-368159053), but briefly: protect integrity and authenticity of messages, resist (silent) censorship and prevent spam.

In short, Politeia is Git anchored to blockchain, hence expensive to rewrite, easy to replicate and verify. Moderation has provable censorship. For every post you get a ""censorship token"" that you can use to publicly prove you've been censored. Additional spam protection is done by requiring tiny payment to create account and post.

The design is not fully decentralized, only the critical bits. I find it quite pragmatic, it allows to get something working with minimum P2P challenges and is ""good enough"" to bootstrap governance process that is still a huge improvement over vanilla Reddit. End goal is to decentralize control of project fund and disburse according to holder vote.

Relevant for Bitcoin Cash is that it is coin-agnostic (Decred stuff is plugin). Further, parts can be reused to allow broader application of the concept of versioned and timestamped data.

Current state: storage and anchoring done, paywall in testing, coin voting in development. [Test version](https://test-proposals.decred.org/) is running with CLI and Reddit-looking GUI.

It amazing you literally identify the same issues that motivated btcsuite/Decred developers in 2013-2015.";1;0;False;jet_user;dxajkpq;AMA: Ask Mike Anything;89z483;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/89z483/ama_ask_mike_anything/

"I'd say that because 12 years of indoctrination in government schools persuades many people that businesses and markets are a kind of evil bogeyman that we need to be ""protected"" from.

Even when they start to wake up to the injustices done by governments and their misleading propaganda efforts, that firmly-planted pin takes a while to fall. It is a false ""truth"" that they have been made to recant since they were very small.
