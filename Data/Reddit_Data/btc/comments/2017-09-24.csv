Yes, it uses smart contracts but it seems a bit hacky to sort a problem out regarding fees.

You can never transact more than your direct contact have deposited. The 'network' will grow but with time however but it almost reminds me of Facebook social graph. This does mean the big boys like CoinBase could setup payment channels with massive deposits, which does mean it's centralised more so.

Once you submit the transaction to the blockchain, there's your fee right there. 

Let's not even get started in miners, which basically are required to keep the network up.
We've already seen miners switching between coins to gain maximum profit.

Right? I mean, I get the point but who/what the fuck is this for? Preaching to the choir? What is happening to this sub seems hardly better than what happened to r/bitcoin.

Yeah, Bitcoin is already a bit complex and a lot of us do quite a bit of work explaining it to newbs as it is. Making it even more complex, along with making sending example Bitcoin transactions an embarrassment has not been welcome.;2;0;False;Richy_T;dng1vla;They used to use Bitcoin...;723ys4;https://imgur.com/a/etoB5

Basically Core wants us to be forced to 2nd layer solutions and complicated kludge vaporware that is unusable and does not even exist and won't even work as they try to claim.  We just want to use Bitcoin as it was designed, that is what Bitcoin Cash is for.  /u/tippr tip 0.002 bcc;3;3;False;cryptorebel;dngbbve;They used to use Bitcoin...;723ys4;https://imgur.com/a/etoB5
