So if I want to sell stuff on EBay, I might expect to see a net positive of several thousand dollars or more over a year.

Ah, I see what you mean. There's a way to receive money on a channel where you were the only one to lock funds: you spend part of it first, that part moves to the other side and you can receive it back as payments.

Otherwise, if you want to be able to receive immediately, the other party has to  lock funds as well. Maybe they can collect extra fees for that, or some type of interest, I don't know. But it doesn't seem like a hard problem to solve.

Maybe not, since your fees go down if you're better connected because you have more routing choices.

">Bcash is fully on board with the client server / master slave model 

I think it's appropriate to say decentralization is a scale and most BCH supporters believe there is plenty of room for larger blocks to provide sufficient decentralization.

That's using some generic terms to describe some unmeasured concepts.  Is ""decentralization"" a fixed number of nodes?  Does global location have any impact?  Do mining pools have much impact?  Is it a ratio of nodes / miners to userbase as measured by X?  What makes node count grow or decline - business incentive to run a node, an overall portion of the userbase, relationship to secure alternatives to full nodes (better SPV makes node count decrease?), bootstrap time vs ongoing costs, miners' needs to stay fully connected to the global mining network....

The issue with the current implementation you describe (bip37) is that it doesn’t scale well. Each time an spv client connects to a miner, the entire chain needs to be scanned from their last connection point to present. This is fixed with the above.

This is one area where I might well be missing something... 

My understanding is that when you open a channel to a peer, both you and the peer need to commit as much Bitcoin as you feel will be transacted over the lifetime of the channel. So if I want to sell stuff on EBay, I might expect to see a net positive of several thousand dollars or more over a year. But maybe not. I'm sure that hubs will be more than happy to accommodate buyers, where they can open a channel with little or no contribution on their part. But what business is going to be willing to tie up significant funds in a channel for me, on the off chance that I'll end up receiving a bunch of payments? 

As for the routing comment - I agree that most transaction paths will be quite short, probably 3 to 5 hops or so.  But there are going to be a huge number of nodes, most of which will be small, poorly connected leaf nodes. And even the specific channels between well connected hubs will be somewhat ephemeral. When I want to pay for my alpaca socks, is the solution to finding an adequate (never mind best) route scalable. There are models that might be applicable - TOR's onion routing and/or BGP.  But I haven't seen anyone claim that they have developed an algorithm that when tested in simulation allows the Lightning Network to function at thousands or tens of thousands of times of the current size. And I have heard people with much more network routing experience than myself express doubts. The routing problem is clearly difficult. But it must be solved, as LN depends being able to quickly and efficiently allow transactions to be directed through several unrelated nodes to the destination.

"> Probably with something similar to BGP routing. Occasionally a route will fail because of outdated capacity information but the user will only notice a small delay if a few more routes have to be attempted.

BGP only needs to reconverge when a routers peering status is changed. Summarised IP subnets are shared between neighbours and remain relatively static.

In Lightning Network, peers are learned via other peers and can change at any moment. This is how the LN decentralisation works. Channels are opened and closed between these peers dynamically upon each use. Each channel creation is essentially reconverging the routing table before a transaction can be sent. LN penetration right now is so minuscule, yet transactions are already failing due to routing issues caused by constant, massive reconvergence. 

BGP was designed to be statically connected to its peers without constant neighbour changes and with a relatively static routing table. Sure it receives new routes from those peers constantly, but it is not constantly dropping those peers and routes and looking for new ones. LN is. Without huge changes to the way LN decentralisation works, it can't scale like BGP. It would need to become a centralised layer. 

I'm by no means an LN expert, but I am a senior network engineer that has been working in the DC space for 15 years. LN is a completely different beast to traditional routing protocols that I just can't fathom a solution for; it just can't follow the same fundamentals without centralisation.

I could be wrong here, but I don't believe they even need that.

"The conclusion of the post is completely flawed, /u/MortuusBestia. The complete switch over by hash power is **extremely difficult**, if not outright impossible. Ironically, the reason for this are... fees. Yes, those hated high fees. Here's why.

There are two possibilities for a ""hash migration"". A ""slow"" migration and a ""fast"" migration. In the case of a slow migration, the network will adapt downwards, no problems at all. Just instead of ~2wks, it might be 15-17 days. In the case of a fast migration, though the situation gets more interesting, and we've seen some of that in November last year. What happens is that the txs backlog increases correspondingly fast. And what happens when the txs backlog increases? Fees increase! Which means that the corresponding block reward increases! Hence, miners will not be so keen to switch, especially because the price will never go to $0 immediately. (Unless there's a fundamental protocol flaw discovered, that is.)

Remember when Greg was ""popping champagne""? That's when the fees exceeded the block reward. For one or two blocks, the fees accounted for more than 12.5 BTC. It would happen again. Now assume parity of price - A miner has the option to mine Bitcoin with ~25 BTC reward OR BCH with, say, ~15BCH reward. What will they mine?

&nbsp;

This reason above is one of the fundamental reasons why I support small blocks AND a fee/blockspace market - Network security. Users are, at the end of the day, paying for the network security. Fees are insurance.

Hi there. Bloom commitment filters can help. Spv clients only need to download blocks they have txs in. They don’t need to store the result. Obv 1gb too big for that today, but once 5g is out 1gb will be a breeze. Also, it’s not strictly necessary unless absolute privacy is essential. Otherwise you can just ask the miner to look up your tx which can be indexed just like in chain explorers. And there’s a tonne of tricks to anonymise this process too.

When you use words, you should try to remember that they can have different meanings in different contexts. Fork in the context of a blockchain's consensus rules has a very specific definition. As does fork in the context of git source control, which is similar, but not identical, to fork in the context of other source control tools.

"From my full node, I'm seeing around 65% of nodes I'm connected to are running a version that's ready for the May 15th upgrade.

Comparing this to the Nov 15th upgrade: at the time of the upgrade, I saw that only about 70% of nodes were upgraded. It's funny, because according to the Blockstream/Core narrative, this should have been detrimental to the network. Instead, it wasn't an issue at all for the larger network. The nodes that weren't upgraded simply stopped receiving new blocks. The node operators eventually saw that their node wasn't operating normally, and upgraded it over the coming days. A week after the Nov 15th upgrade, most nodes on the network were upgraded (I still do see some non-upgraded nodes floating around though - I guess some people just forget they're running a full node?).

Bottom line: the network is in great shape for the coming upgrade.
