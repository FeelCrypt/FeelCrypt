Not only does it silence dissent from the other non Blockstream core devs, it encourages them to compromise any principles they may have had for open source development or sound money. We see it everyday on Wall Street where everyone actually knows about the moral hazard of money printing but they go along with it because they just say fuck it, let me get my share. We see it in the companies and altcoins that numerous core devs have established like Bitgo and Green Address that are built to leverage the 75%discount to SW tx's over regular tx's meant to drive users to centralized LN hubs that will siphon tx fees away from miners. ;18;0;False;H0dl;dev5mcx;Bloomberg: Antpool will switch entire pool to Bitcoin Unlimited;5z3hv5;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-03-13/bitcoin-miners-signal-revolt-in-push-to-fix-sluggish-blockchain

"> Now please die fucking troll.

This is very sad, can't you see how you completely prove the entire basis of my point when you retort with this? I've said each time BU supporters can only engage with argument based tactics. You've offered nothing to this discussion......only argued with me, then resorted to insulting and swearing, which is what I said BU supporters do. This is because they have no substance to their stance, it is born from manipulation and they don't realize the facts, they are just helping a small group of millionaires achieve their personal agenda within Bitcoin.

We already covered this, I'll do it again for you:-

1.) I know, we are agreed BU criticize Core but then steal their work to base changes from. They change core principles that give miners more power, yet don't start from previous versions and even directly reference core in their code.

2.) In your first response you said.... ""because core dev dont want to participate that there is no peer review""....you acknowledgd there isn't any real peer review already, did you forget? Even worse of BU when someone points out a mistake in their code they don't even bother to fix it.

3.) On what planet is it not important to be thorough with code that billions of dollars will rely on? I know....BU shill planet.

4.) Considering this point references the mistake you ALREADY acknowledged in point 3, it is a little difficult to then pretend it never happened, considering its written for all to see.

Feel free to insult me some more I will not mind, I'm sure I am annoying to you but please know this is nothing personal against you, its personal against BU who manipulated and misled people like you into supporting them.

"The entire community is against the propaganda you're spreading. It's not censorship, it's organic disagreement with your misinformation.

Segwit can't bring Bitcoin to Visa levels because it doesn't allow for an adaptive blocksize. But you wouldn't know that because you're not a developer. Don't take it from me, take it from your precious Peter Todd: https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/here-s-how-bitcoin-s-lightning-network-could-fail-1467736127/

Core has made 54% of addresses with Bitcoin amounts unspendable due to high fees.

These users will not be able to open or close LN channels to reach those so called visa levels you're talking about. But you're good at ignoring facts so don't worry about it.

Since you don't do much independent research, I'll just paste the relevant parts here:

>“We do have a failure mode which is: Imagine a whole bunch of these [settlements] have to happen at once,” Todd explained. “There’s only so much data that can go through the bitcoin network and if we had a large number of Lightning channels get closed out very rapidly, how are we going to get them all confirmed? At some point, you run out of capacity.”

>In a scenario where a large number of people need to settle their Lightning contracts on the blockchain, the price for doing so could increase substantially as the available space in bitcoin blocks becomes sparse. “At some point some people start losing out because the cost is just higher than what they can afford,” Todd said. “If you have a very large percentage of the network using Lightning, potentially this cost is very high. **Potentially, we could get this mass outbreak of failure**.”

>The way the Lightning Network works, a user must be able to issue a breach remedy transaction in order to keep their counterparty honest. If a user is unable to make the proper transaction on the blockchain in a certain amount of time, their counterparty may be able to take control of bitcoins tied up in the smart contract between the two parties.

...

> Any situation that allows for coins to be stolen obviously needs to be avoided and according to Todd, there are some theoretical solutions available for this problem. For one, **an adaptive block size limit could allow miners to increase capacity in these sorts of failure scenarios**.

Still trust core's scaling roadmap? They don't give a shit about you.

An adaptive blocksize is exactly what BU adds.

"60% is far more than enough.  Any decrease in hash rate now that blocks are full will cause a 1MB coin to slow down block generation.  This will cause it to accept less transactions.  This will cause fees to go up.  This will mean more and more addresses are frozen and unable to be spent.  

With less transactions and less addresses able to even be spent at all  and a parallel chain still going that has plenty of capacity and the same ledger, what will people use?  They want to transact after all.  People will stop using the 1MB chain because they can't.   Larger addresses will be able to pay high transaction fees and buy fiat or buy into the other chain.  There will be no reason to make anything except for larger and larger transactions since any address that dips under the fee minimum will be unspendable.  The larger addresses will gradually be broken up into smaller units and more value will be frozen.

While this happens the price will drop since the way to actually transact will be on the large block chain. This will cause a feedback loop of less mining power, longer block times, less transaction volume, higher fees (at least in the btc value), and more unspendable addresses.  Less transaction capacity will mean less utility, which will mean lower price etc, until the whole chain collapses and grinds to a halt.";1;2;False;__Cyber_Dildonics__;deva73y;Bloomberg: Antpool will switch entire pool to Bitcoin Unlimited;5z3hv5;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-03-13/bitcoin-miners-signal-revolt-in-push-to-fix-sluggish-blockchain

Well the holders do decide a lot. But not exactly *decide* but incentivize miners to decide. That's the subtlety that trips up the Core side.

    Greg,
    
    ... as it's been explained to me (please correct if there are errors here), this is the case against in broad outlines:
    
    * you work for a venture capital funded startup called blockstream
    
    * blockstream is funded in part from money, now with controlling interest, from the Bilderberg ""club""
    
    * blockstream employs a large fraction, probably a majority of the now ""core"" bitcoin developers
    
    * the primary business of blockstream is to build an off-chain payment network called lightning network (LN), which is a for-profit service that will generate private revenue to this company, and thus pay back the VC investors. at 55M post on last round, it's a 0.5->few billion to pay back this debt.
    
    * the only effective way LN systems work is to implement segwit
    
    * increasing block size now to 2, 4 or 8mb (or at all) reduces the need for a separate payment network like LN
    
    * increasing to 2,4 or 8 mb is possible right now (many tests and data show this, I've seen them), but core has not implemented larger blocks primarily because doing so conflicts with blockstream business priorities - it would lessen any need for off-chain, for-profit transaction processing
    
    * moreover, segwit is inordinately complex, trying to solve for a problem we do not have, and will require all future implementations of bitcoin clients to carry with it the overhead of segwit implementations - which only makes sense if you buy into making off chain systems to process transactions

"With BU, your node has whatever cap you set it to. Which might make you end up on a minority chain, but it was and is always like that. For example, if you set it to Luke-Jr's proposed 300kB now, you follow him on his small block user-activated soft-fork minority chain. (I don't know whether it exists)

So what alternative to being able to set your EB/AD/MG with BU do you want?

*Someone telling you what to do?*
