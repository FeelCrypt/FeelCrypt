There is a battle not because someone here invented it, but because there's a semi-functional cryptocurrency at the no. 1 spot. Furthermore, many supporters of this coin (BTC) will not tolerate anyone else using the Bitcoin name and will attack anyone who does it.

Worse than that, I think many of us feel this current state of the #1 coin is either gross incompetence, technical tunnel vision or worse: intentional corruption. 

All this causes a terrible experience for new users, who are naturally inclined to buy the #1 Bitcoin implementation.

Bcash given up decentralization in order to get some ""omg cheaper transaction"", so it becomes money for cheap people.

Bitcoin keeps the principles of decentralization:

* decentralized validation of chain (in case if miners again play the chain the way they already DID with bch with DAA and mined lots of coins ahead of schedule and also made the transactions stuck for up to 10 hours, even if you would pay 10,000 $ - just because 
there were no blocks since everyone was mining Bitcoin instead)

And for cheap instant transactions, we do not give up and use INSECURE 0-conf (while lying it is secure), instead we slowly but surly develop new technology, like Lightning Network with proper Watchtowers and backups, for secure, instant payments at tiny or even zero cost.

* more decentralized mining - smaller block size - no good reason to centralize in one china warehouse

"We need to tell the real story which is that the bitcoin project got derailed by the Bankers and fee sucking interests.

BCH is the real bitcoin; BTC is being slowly designed to be worse eg spv efficiency reduction, replace by fee, scamson mows trolling idiotic comments, 1mb cap etc. ( https://youtu.be/q-sMbf2OzOY molyneux s video.)

I’m just gonna say yeah it’s nice to have all the BCH features and all that, but the narrative is as important or more important the tech. Bitcoin ( as Cash ) was designed to replace the zero innovation of the banking world, who played with other peoples money and got bailed out by taxpayers when they should have bailed in their own resources.

If we just focus on the features well great we're another altcoin project.

BCH is the closest genetic ancestor to SN’s initial project, 

All those years of lies of Adam Back, lies of compromise, S2X , backing out etc.

It’s clear the banking cabal have bought these immoralists out. The stakes are high and people should use both exit - BCH and voice - narrative. 

Or else there will be none to tell the truth except the Politburo of Blockstream.

Imagine if many many people started using BCH for everyday payments (the thing that gave it value in the first place - SR, ABM, alpaca socks, pizza etc.).. it would be so cool.
