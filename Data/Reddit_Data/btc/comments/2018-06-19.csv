">r/cryptocurrency moderation has changed hands over the past seven months. This is clear as day.

How? I started about 4 months ago and the current mods are doing great work and are fair. Some mods are new, although some are not they just switched to a new account. Some of the mods were removed because they weren't active at all, like months of no activity and the two oldest mods are also inactive.

>It is highly suspected that r/bitcoin mods now have control over the r/cryptocurrency subreddit.

That makes no sense to us because we've never even spoken to r/bitcoin mods, we speak to a lot of mods from other communities via Discord and our mod subreddit and I haven't seen any r/bitcoin mods there ever. I'm pretty sure some of the mods were banned in that sub anyway. We're entirely neutral and don't prohibit posts on BCH or BTC. 

Regarding your other points, I have no idea what's going on and I hope it all works out for you because if what you're saying is true then it's unacceptable and Reddit admins should help you.

"Just a clarification, while BCH (Bitcoin Cash or, simply, Bitcoin) and BTC (Bcore Segwit) are technically both ‘forks’, the hard/soft fork dichotomy is Core bullshit to try to frame it as if Bitcoin Cash somehow ‘split off’ from the main chain.

But for blockchain systems, ‘Fork’ is just a synonym for upgrade, with the difference being that Bitcoin Cash is more accurately considered as a proper upgrade of Bitcoin, whereas BTC - ‘soft’ though the fork maybe - INTRODUCES FAR MORE DIFFERENCES.

To go by the mainstream open-source connotations of the terms:

* BCH is what would be considered an upgrade

* BTC is what can be more properly termed as a fork, seeing as how it introduces major changes under the hood and requires code changes for software that needs to take advantage of Segwit.

Furthermore, Segwit is a pretty unsatisfactory hack that fixes issues such as malleability ONLY for coins in Segwit addresses. From a coding standpoint, it is inelegant, crufty and hackish.

No, they'll get removed because we don't want spam and we direct those posts to the meta subreddit.

Yes it is, if a big group of people are posting the same thing, it's spam.

>Multiple people posting they are banned is just as appropriate as multiple people posting about individually different matters.

You can spin it anyway you like, but r/bitcoin started with the exact same reasoning. We've all seen it before.

>Yes it is, if a big group of people are posting the same thing, it's spam.

No, no its not. You're changing the meaning of spam. Remember, you are not a moderator here, heavy handed tactics will not work.

>And we are not the sub for that.

Of course not, you don't want people exposing your corruption, I understand. r/bitcoin had the same motives.

>We can't take someone's claim seriously without all the evidence, a simple screenshot or explanation isn't proof even if I believe them.

I've already provided a method for you to investigate this, and as moderators honestly you would've already seen it, which is how I know you've been biased for a while now. Your job is to be the 'good cop' who talks about 'proper procedures', 'we're not a group for that', etc. to pacify those who get angry at what the 'bad cop' actors do. I.e. censorship, hiding posts, allowing certain posts to get visibility, and hiding certain others, and other 
underhanded techniques mastermined by the trolls who bought your sub.";1;1;False;thethrowaccount21;e0xsjoo;"Former /r/cryptocurrency mod: ""I used to be a mod of r/cryptocurrency until they kicked me out.

">By preventing active and honest discussion about alternative

We aren't prevent honest discussion that follows the rules.

>allowing FUD,

We try our best to curb FUD but it's not always easy since we deal with dozens of cryptos so we have to actively investigate each crypto and work out what's true and what's not. If I don't know, I leave it until we work it out.

>brigading and other soft-shoe censorship tactics.

Funnily enough we're usually the target of brigades and remove posts that are being brigaded as required.

"And those two communities have HEAVY bags and LOTS of SALT due to the failures of their respective projects. [Monero's privacy has never really worked](https://www.wired.com/story/monero-privacy/) since its launch, they can barely afford to fund projects, boasting about hiring 2 math PhDs. I mean, that's nice and good for them, but coins need more than 2 math PhDs. Marketing, development, business development, support for 3rd party integrations, etc. Turns out this all costs money and takes a lot of time. 

LTC has COMPLETELY failed as any sort of payment coin. BOTH of their vaunted payment gateways turned out to be complete DUDs/Scams before launch. They got trolled hard, and honestly it serves them right for basing their investment on a personality cult they created to double down on their bad decisions last time when LTC tanked. The point is, those two communities were deeply wounded by their failures, and are lashing out at more successful projects.";1;1;False;thethrowaccount21;e0xn8wj;"Former /r/cryptocurrency mod: ""I used to be a mod of r/cryptocurrency until they kicked me out.

"That's what the monero community does against Dash. They scream about the 'instamine', when monero's 'original' developers released [a crippled miner](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/4r4fw9/what_is_the_monero_cripple_mine_and_fastmine/) so that they could mine more than everyone else in secret. Vitalik stated he was mining $6k /day after he made his own optimizations.

On r/cryptocurrency, every thread about Dash that is not negative is downvoted to obscurity and has 0 comments, while all the shitposts and FUD have 60-120+ upvotes and loads of repetitive, 'on-message' FUD talking points. Given this information, it is reasonable to assume that there are certain communities that have been taken over as 'attack coins', as a base from which to launch attacks on coins that closest fulfill Satoshi's true vision. Dash and BCH are at the forefront of this list, which makes as to why they're so heavily fudded and censored against.

"Go through that mod's history, they have a long list of copious anti-Dash FUD posts. That person is also a prominent member of the monero community, yet they actively take time to deliberately lie about other, competing projects. That itself is a conflict of interest, making that individual a mod is doubly so. Do you see now? Why truth and honesty are so important? Why its so important to not be taken in by lies and smooth words? 

Coblee really serenaded his community, right before he lubed up. Same with FluffyPony when he P&D'ed his community last year. Guess what?

"Look, all I can tell you is to read the Dash bitcointalk thread. You will see all these monero guys in their true colors. You can read YEARS OF LYING and attempts to censor independent forms of discussion. I talk about Dash a lot because that's who they targetted the most, back then Dash was the only other privacy coin. 

As you can see, they've had to expand their operation a bit these days. But you have to ask yourself how do people like that get into positions of power like this. Nepotism is your answer. Just like Coinbase should be looked at VERY SUSPICIOUSLY because they hired Charlie Lee, then added an asset he was heavily invested in while he was an employee, which he promptly quit being after the coin was added. 

Now you have potentially tens of thousands of STEAMING-SHIT BAG-HOLDERS who didn't know any better. They thought litecoin was going to be on Amazon! They thought segwit and atomic swaps and unicorn blowjobs! It was all nothing. A wolf-of-Wallstreet fugazi. By very afraid of anyone who gets by on Nepotism, because they usually don't have the talent to get by on anything else. Which means they'll do ANYTHING to get what they want.
