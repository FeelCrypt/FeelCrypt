Segwit is not a blocksize increase. It allows user to separate the signature data from a transaction.

"As a lurker, I'm fully aware of r/btc's views of Segwit and the censorship scandal. It's sad that r/bitcoin has been rather biased, but I see a lot of bias in r/btc as well. I try to learn the truth for myself through the arguments of both sides.

Trying to be objective about it and poking around in the code for myself, I have come to the conclusion that a lot, if not all, of the fear of Segwit is really just that-- fear from FUD. The endlessly repeated claim that we only get 1.7x boost in transactions at 4x cost in bandwidth, is a classic example. Only by extreme contortions can you call this true; in the average case, you'll get roughly a 1:1 increase in transactions for the increase in bytes transmitted across the wire and stored in a block. There is a very small overhead but nothing like the claim above. Another unfounded fear is that separating the signatures will cause legal problems down the road. In practice, those signatures will still be available from full archival nodes; and at any rate, these are cryptographic signatures used in the system and were never designed or intended to be compared to legal signatures. This kind of FUD is really tiresome, especially after one sees it debunked and yet repeated breathlessly over and over again.
Yes, there are similar examples of bogus arguments against big blocks. I see the dangers of big blocks as more a matter of degree, though, depending on the size of the increase. A 2X increase should be safe enough, while allowing us to judge whether it does lead us in a more centralized direction, and this is why I support Segwit2X.";1;1;False;scientastics;dkqdt43;If the 2X portion of Segwit2x fails to activate, Bitcoin.com will immediately shift all company resources to supporting Bitcoin Cash exclusively.;6peqwr;https://www.bitcoin.com/public-service-announcement
"I see how you might feel SegWit is not a block size increase because ""Bigger blocks allows more transactions without prejudice. Segwit only allows more Segwit transactions"".

"Thank you for the conversation about it. In this case I think you are underestimating the risk of segwit as a soft fork. Many people like me would have been somewhat ok with it as a hard fork but as it stands it is an unnecessary and large security, economic and I suspect legal risk to bitcoin.

I assert that that support on the big block size is mostly grass roots. The support on the small block and segwit side is mostly manufactured. Assuming that is correct, you can see that people like me believe that ""moderates"" are victims of social engineering of the overton window. We do not support a false compromise when there is still a better option available.

You could at least softfork it out: ""segwit transactions will no longer be accepted after block X. Get your money out before that or it will become unspendable"". With a hardfork, you could also make it anyone-can-spend again.

You'd still have to deal with the trash in the history of the block chain of course, but you might be able to delete most of the validation code (and the witness data) and replace it with a checkpoint (treating the segwit spend transactions as successful anyone-can-spends).";1;0;False;aaaaaaaarrrrrgh;dkqt4c2;If the 2X portion of Segwit2x fails to activate, Bitcoin.com will immediately shift all company resources to supporting Bitcoin Cash exclusively.;6peqwr;https://www.bitcoin.com/public-service-announcement

"I think if Bitcoin Cash gets too small, it's easy to break it irreversible, technically and economically.  

Technically there will be DDoS attacks for sure, and all sorts of 51% stuff if it's too cheap to reach that majority. If the network gets technically unreliable, nobody will use it. And nobody will *start* to use it again, because he alone would have to cope with all the technical shit from nodecount to DDoS protection to stuck transactions or exchanges being out of sync and so on.

Economically, if the price drops too low (let's say around $5) it could be bought out completely by banksters. Hell, even $100mn isn't much in a world where central banks print billions every month. Would you want to use a coin later on when you know some big banks bought 70 or 80% of the supply?
