"You have on the one hand companies that are interested in things like micro-payments, for example. They don't necessarily care about bitcoin the currency, but the thing is existing players (e.g. PayPal) don't have viable offerings at that price point and transaction volume, and regulatory capture ensures that a mountain of red tape prevents newcomers from disrupting that industry. For these companies, bitcoin is simply risk reduction compared with a USDcoin offering.

On the other hand, there are companies that are interested in things like timestamping hashes, or smart contract arbitration. These companies don't necessarily care for bitcoin the currency, but they do want the level of security provided by the bitcoin block chain and understand that security is driven by economic incentives related to the decentralized bitcoin currency.

You don't have a rational argument.  No one is saying that there cannot be off chain scaling.  What so many are saying is that they want on chain scaling to be possible.  If off chain scaling happens as well that is fine - and it may address the business case you have put forward.  Why does on chain scaling preclude off chain?  What is so hard to understand about this?  It is all stalling and delay so that the off chain solution comes along as it is not ready yet and blocks are full.  What right do you have to hijack all the holders of bitcoin who want on chain scaling.  For my own part I am growing increasingly furious at the delaying tactics and devious tactics and I am sure I am not the only one. Ultimately, miners do not have the power, holders do - and if they turn things will get very ugly indeed - particularly if it coincides with the halving. The only thing that is currently holding up the price is China capital crisis and capital controls.
