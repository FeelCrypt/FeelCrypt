"I have been around bitcoin from its inception and have spent like 20 hours reading posts here and on /r/Bitcoin as of late. I am running core and have no idea what client I need to change to in order to be in compliance. I have the UASF client downloaded but could not explain if asked if the UASF client is compatible with the segwit2x HF.

I might be able to figure it out if I spend an hour or two reading the right stuff but just from the news/reddit/podcasts it isn't really clear what to do, so I have taken all of my keys and put them into cold storage and am waiting this all out.

lukejr plan worked. In tree months if miners will still insist on this 2x part, expect luke's uasf2.0, and miners will simply back out under umbrella of some new agreement or other shit like this.

"Forced? I think UASF threat was weak but miners saw this as an opportunity to go for the original HK agreement. This was probably a very bad idea (because they may not get what they want) but we will see how it plays out.

It is really unclear why the miners, in favor of 2x and not really wanting segwit that much, decided to go for segwit2x instead of just letting a uasf split happen and competing for main chain dominance, then implementing hard fork in reasonable time frame with buy in from both users and economic power houses.

It really is about the miners wanting and being willing to compromise. Unlike BSCore who has been clearly shown to never compromise while kicking and screaming like that baby in the OP. Whether it was the best strategic decision remains to be seen. I think that we'll all be surprised to see in 3m the 2mbhf that we've all wanted, not as the best big block increase initiative, but as a proof of concept and a launch to the next level in terms of long term strategic planning for miners and business. ;17;1;False;H0dl;dkkcv30;Miners right now.;6oty7x;http://i.gifntext.com/XONq3rINt7.gif
