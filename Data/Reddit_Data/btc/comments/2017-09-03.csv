"hahahaha. You segwit trolls are so cute with your blatant and desperate lies. :]
Segwit has MAJOR, MAJOR technical shortcomings and huge security flaws due to the separation of TX and signature data. 

What's hilarious is that these shortcomings have been pointed out many different times by many different people and **no segwit supporter has ever produced a reasonable technical rebuttal.**

That's right...you guys can't say WHY he is wrong, you just scream he is wrong as loud as you can and hope people believe you. You claim ""propaganda"" etc. But the problem is you never explain why. 

It is YOU that is lying.

"Great post.   

Imagine if you had $1,000,000 sitting in a savings account for your kid's college in 10 years.  Would you let it sit there and depreciate slowly, or quietly invest it for even a 1% return on the side?   

I'll just borrow it for a while, make money and pay it back.  We'll both have more.  My intentions are pure and the odds good.  Before I know it, I'm fractional reserve banking.  

Going further, imagine that instead of having to use this $1,000,000 to pay for things, you can pay with a fictional token you made up.  It represents the deposited money, one to one, you swear, but you don't have to prove it.  You're never audited, and can issue as many as you want.

Man, so you got a pot of cash that nobody can see, and you can issue new cash to represent it that nobody can verify.  How is that different than the FED?   

Worse, you've been hacked for USD $75,000,000, and are now desperate to repay this.  Not to mention any other normal financial challenges someone has running a business.    

Is this analogy right?

Announcements
New release v2.5.6 - Review the latest features and improvements.
Announcements > USD Withdrawals Update
May 12, 2017
As noted in our prior announcement, US correspondent banks continue to block international wires. USD, however, continues to flow domestically in Taiwan and other channels have been slowly ramping up as evidenced by the price spreads narrowing between Bitfinex and other exchanges. Unfortunately, the solutions available to us at the moment are limited to specific customer profiles in certain jurisdictions, though we are working tirelessly to expand our portfolio of deposit and withdrawal options (including support for other fiat currencies) to meet the needs of our global customer base. If and when a customer qualifies for one of these channels, we will reach out to the customer. There is no need to inquire by means of a support ticket.

We have, however, moved the majority of our funds out of Taiwan and the “one-time” withdrawal solution discussed in the prior announcement is coming online. Unfortunately, due to the cumbersome nature of the settlement procedure, we are processing these requests in descending order of size as we learn how to handle the process more efficiently. For the time being, we will only process requests above $50,000 in size. We believe that by the time we are able to get to the smaller withdrawals, other, less cumbersome withdrawal solutions will become more widely available. If you are interested in this option, please submit a normal withdrawal request and reference in a support ticket with subject “USD settlement request” - we will contact you when we are ready to process that withdrawal.

We are deeply grateful for the patience and forbearance that our customers and shareholders have shown us as we work to restore normal operations. We apologize for the inconvenience and look forward to resolving these problems in the coming weeks.

The ability to purchase BTC/ETH/LTC/whatever with a coin (USDT) that doesn't actually have the value it claims to is very dangerous. Assume 50% of tether is artificially created without trade for actual US Dollar. This would put the true value of tether at 50¢ whereas the market perceives it to be 100¢. Therefore people are actually paying half of what they believe to be paying for crypto. In this assumption, no trades are being made in other denominations, but I hope it's clearer to you now how this could be a huge problem. It's equivalent to the ability to create BTC out of thin air beyond the constraints of the code because some people/exchanges/whoever may not be really paying anything for their crypto while others are paying market value. I liken it to the Federal reserve printing money out of thin air on a whim.;11;2;False;hybridman06;dmi17rc;As 20m more Tether are issued today, I think it's important for people to know that an unbacked Tether could be a big reason for the recent bitcoin price rise.

"Yes I thought that at first. But a USDT isn't a dollar, it's not worth a dollar, can't be redeemed for a dollar. 

When it's worth 0.001USDT per $, the BTC per USDT will skyrocket. But the BTC per $ will plummet. Why? Because now there's only real dollars willing to buy BTC, no more fake dollars willing to pay whatever price.

"Doesn't matter.  If tether goes down,  anything it touched goes down with it. Will they die? Not at all but it will probably be the next mt Gox crash. This shouldn't just be a target to use on BTC but a warning for all cryptos using tether. Tether should be made using blockchain tech so that USD and tether are in full sync and can be tracked to make sure all exchanges are valid and all tethers can be accounted for. If tether is just a placeholder that exchanges put down that we trust isn't being manipulated, then it's not just fiat but worse, digital fiat. Digital fiat is inflation 2.0. All it takes is one corrupt action to bring fraud to the markets. So I'm not sure how tether is managed but if it is based on trust,  then I believe the crypto markets have been compromised. Anyone exploiting tether is basically stealing Bitcoins on exchanges and simultaneously raising prices at will. This issue needs to be brought up pronto and made public now;  Again this only makes sense if tether is based on trust. 

Edit : To clarify,  don't you worry your little head about holding BTC. Even if tether really is being exploited and getting quietly minted to buy Bitcoins for free, there's a chance no crash will come and the people involved get in trouble. Why might there be no crash? Because we *already* buy cryptos with corrupt and inflated money,  So how is tether really any different?

"I agree that tether is dreadful. But don't see how it going pop would take Bitcoin down.

Those trading tether for Bitcoin are doing so with tether treated as 100% USD. And it's a sensible trade once you factor in tethers risk.

But when it collapses it is the people who accepted crappy usdt for valuable Bitcoin who are screwed. The owners of Bitcoin can be glad they've got something that isn't debased.

Note: the argument is exactly the same as it is for buying Bitcoin with any fiat currency that some central authority (government) is busy printing. Get rid of your shit in exchange for something good.

My advice to sellers of Bitcoin is not to accept usdt in exchange in the same way I'd recommend not accepting Venezuelan Bolivars. However if you can get some fool to sell you Bitcoin for your Venezuelan Bolivars... Do it now. Do it fast before more of the value you're holding gets inflated away.

If bitfinex have done this then they're obviously dodgy. But what they've done will leave them solvent, with usdt becoming worthless but that's all.

"Bitfinex claims they have established banking relationships at the institutional level.  They claim that they have solutions in place for large-volume customers, whereby they can easily cash in and out via USD in the traditional banking system.

This is a pretty convenient situation.  It's difficult to verify.  We are to believe that a small group of high volume customers are pumping USD into the system and buying Tether.  Who are these high volume customers?  Does Bitfinex ever offer them the option to sell the Tether back at 1:1?  If not, then how can Tether be anything more than just a ponzi scheme?

Its not about market cap, its about order books, as USDT is literally only good for trading for BTC (you can't redeem it for USD).

"As I see it, usdt has the sixth highest volume of any crypto at 237m$.

"OK, but if Bitfinex is creating fradulent tethers, and buying real BTC on their exchange, that would be found out awfully quickly when customers try to withdraw funds and are told ""Sorry, we can't allow you to withdraw, since your coins were sold to a customer with fraudulent Tethers"". That news would get out pretty damn quickly. And if customers ARE able to withdraw funds, then for all practical purposes, the Tethers ARE backed by real funds. The money to pay those customers is coming from SOMEwhere along the Bitfinex chain, whether they choose to pay it out on the Bitfinex side, or the Tether side.

The difference to the customer is nil.";6;1;False;BTCrob;dmhp8vy;As 20m more Tether are issued today, I think it's important for people to know that an unbacked Tether could be a big reason for the recent bitcoin price rise.
