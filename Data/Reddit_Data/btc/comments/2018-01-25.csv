"The computation time is very explicitly bounded by the block gas limit. I don't really get your argument there, perhaps you should elaborate.

Fast block times provide more granular finality measure, users can basically decide for themselves which blocks are deep enough to be considered final. In case of transactions with low double-spend risk, you can achieve higher speed of operations, but if you want bitcoin-like assurances, you can wait for the block to be buried by 100 blocks, only cost is higher amount of uncles.

edit: To elaborate on my response to your vague argument. For mining nodes, I can see some overhead in constructing new blocks, but that's completely negligible in comparison with computation spent on actual mining.

With crypto things are succeeding or failing every month and being weeded out. Multiple crashes ie 30-40% pullbacks or more happen all the time. Its a very condensed timeline and very positive vs previous bubbles in other assets.

"If you can't afford to lose that five percent then you need to be careful about betting it on anything as volatile and poorly understood blockchain and crypto and crypto as an asset class.  Maybe it will blow up and well all get rich, maybe it will have long term gains comparable to the regular market.  Maybe some new dark swan blockchain(s) will outcompete the current options to such a degree that current HODLers will lose earning potential compared to investing in other asset classes.

The safe bet if your old or you already have a lot of saving is to diversify.  If your unrealized lifetime earnings potential is high then it makes sense to take a bigger risk.  You have less of your life and value creating potential to lose, relatively speaking.

And Ethereum can't in practice even handle cryptokitties. I can't evaluate whether any of the various sharding ideas could because they haven't even chosen and implemented one but I can say for sure that it doesn't work the way it is, that should be obvious. 

Ethereum blocks are way too close together. It's difficult to choose just the right distance but Ethereum clearly chose way too close together. If they were further apart you could turn up the gas limit way more without breaking it, so it still wouldn't scale to everything but it would scale to a lot more.

"IDK what the point of this conversation is. Do you think you're right on the edge of convincing me or some observer that big blocks don't work and that comment's going to do it. You know about the gigablock testnet right? I saw they're hiring someone to make a block explorer for in, that's gonna be cool! Are you looking forward to seeing on that block explorer, that one of the many BCH dev teams is hiring someone to make, how gigabyte blocks totally *don't* work? Do you really expect there to only be a few nodes because the blocks are so big? How much you wanna bet? 

*Just for the very first test* weeks after deciding to try it out they *already* used multiple providers to put nodes on every continent, *just to see what happens*. So you think once it's the actual network used by everyone (remember, it *has* to be used by *everyone* for *everything* for us to *need* this capacity) there will still only be as many nodes as this *little test*? Why? You think there will be so few nodes left in the *whole world* that they'll be somehow seized or monopolized? Why? Why wouldn't there be zillions of nodes, because, again, *everyone's using it for everything* so it's *kinda important* so *lots of people care for lots of reasons*. 

You can't have it both ways. If it's small enough and unimportant enough that no one cares to invest anything more substantial than a Raspberry Pi to watch what's happening, it doesn't need big blocks anyway. If it's important enough to society to fill big blocks every ten minutes then it's very important to lots of people and investing actual resources in a full node is fine. 

You understand you're allowed to work with other people to maintain a full node, right? You don't have to have one in your basement. You can work with *anyone you trust in the whole world*. If you don't trust any human enough to consolidate the money, you and a thousand other people could even trust a *DAO* to consolidate the money. The only scenario where you need to worry about full nodes being too expensive for you as an individual is if you *literally do not trust another human being on Earth nor any other system you can imagine*.

"No you can't solve your problem by just forking off to smaller blocks, if you have a petabyte worth of legacy transactions to deal with. If you're asking why is it problematic to have only couple of full nodes, you could be also asking why not just use a centralised database.

What's your problem, it's not going to have as many full nodes as you wish it had? You wish you could have a full node on it but you can't afford one? Well, there's a lot of things we all wish we could afford?? What do you specifically think is going to happen bad to the too-few full nodes? I really can't imagine what scenario you're imagining. If something bad happened, with the full nodes, if it really went terribly wrong somehow....... then you could fork? So? Why would that not be enough of a remedy for you? You can always fork off to smaller blocks at any time. The only reason you wouldn't is because it's completely unnecessary. If it were in fact necessary and lots of people agreed it was, you could do it whenever you wanted.

"I'm young, my future earnings potential is much higher than my net worth, so I can afford to lose 5%.  That's why I'm invested in 20% crypto and 80% growth oriented stock heavy index funds and a new business that is not yet profitable but obviously I'm hoping it will be in the next year or two.

I could lose it all and it would be terrible but I have 30-40 more years to prepare for retirement.

The whole concept of the ICO is very stock-like, I mean, except for the no actual stake in the issuer or voting rights, and yes, no P/E, which is not the positive you think it is, since earnings are good, and support the price of actual stocks. And a Hard Fork looks a lot like a stock spinoff, in how you just get a new coin, because you owned an old coin on a certain date. I know stocks, as you do, but this is actually much more like the tulip bulb mania, which was way before our time. Here you have a digital asset, which might formerly have been something like WoW gold or Magic The Gathering digital cards, which had real value and moved up, but not moonshot like (MTGOX was actually set up to trade Digital Magic cards, before moving to the new digital hotness), and now we have crypto coins are worth the price of a new car, quite similar in max value to what tulip bulbs went to at the height of their mania. I really don't see the need for a different digital coin for every thing in the real world, and considering how many companies are dropping Bitcoin support, its not clear if we even will get the dollar replacement we could actually use. And many new tokens are pure Wild West, with billions issued and no real caps, in many cases, but Ripple comes to mind for a particularly vast initial pot, insta-Billionaring its creators. Take my Kodak, please, I mean, look at me, I have a TOKEN !!!1!, so pathetic.

But this is rational. This guy did his homework. On TV? Wow, that is awesome. How far we have come indeed.

Next step: Don't speculate, participate. Or maybe 20% speculate 80% participate.

If nobody uses Bitcoin as a currency it will eventually fail and go to zero.

So use Bitcoin and make it flow. Money needs to flow, coins need to roll. 

Everybody knows this except some crazy radicals that we don't want to talk about anymore.

"I'll be damned ... mainstream media's actually getting a little better at reporting crypto. There are obviously still huge blunders and biases and whatever, but little by little, it seems to be seeping in. 

That's incidentally one of the interesting things about the regulation going on now ... I'm not pro-regulation by any means, but there's a silver-lining to this regulation push, I think. In order to regulate something, you have to try to understanding it. I know there will be bad-faith attempts, and some will try and fail, but ... I think a lot of people, when they get over their initial biases and start to learn more about what's actually going on, are going to begin to appreciate the quality projects in this space (despite the trend towards cynicism lately, there are some) and ... some might even have their own ""lightbulb"" moments, moving from skeptic to evangelist.

The hype may not be full on internet bubble level, and Wall Street may have missed this, but it is damn well a massive price bubble in the crypto world, and most of the gainz have already been 'pre-mined' at these price points. A $ 10,000 coin is just not going to 100x again, its just not possible in a world of these big numbers, crypto to 10 TRILLION USD ? Where is all that fiat going to come from ? I think the mainstream investors will realize that they missed the big move, and won't ever go all in on crypto, its just too far from most people's comfort zone. Also, some scamcoins may be failing, but everything that has a decent algorithm and a dog on its coin is still going up when Bitcoin goes up, regardless of the fundamentals. This is very similar to the internet bubble, how all the not 100% scamcoins move similarly. Also the internet was just getting started in 1995, you can't look at the Bitcoin chart and say its just getting started, this horse has been running for a long time now.;1;1;False;triplewitching2;dt7n9ds;"CNBC - ""That's what the crypto kids called 'getting rekt'""";7snliz;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7h6oWYYius&feature=youtu.be

A: The standard deposit insurance amount is $250,000 per depositor, per FDIC-insured bank, per ownership category. For a basic category-by-category overview of FDIC deposit insurance coverage, you can use the Account Categories tool.

The ""Your Insured Deposits"" brochure also includes more comprehensive information and examples of deposit insurance coverage for various ownership categories. You can also access the FDIC's Electronic Deposit Insurance Estimator (EDIE) to get details about your specific situation.

Not sure what you are implying here about being stupid. The law clearly states the U.S. Federal government is a Corporation and it does not have authority over american citizens at all, unless of course those citizens wish to be public officials by one of the many traps that are set for them to become so.

> “Scam money”

Yep, the Federal Government went bankrupt and in order to continue to function, they needed to adopt private credit instead, but not just within the federal government as intended, but across the whole country. Its a scam because its a matter of national emergency and they aren't telling anyone about. Just letting people continue to think there is no problem and they can keep printing and it just magically gets created without any consequences. Yep, its a scam, brother.

> but if one bank is using it they all are.

Exactly! If one bank uses ""scam money"" and another bank uses ""scam money"" then guess what? They are accessories to the scam. Now, if a bank does not use ""scam money"", then are they also guilty of the scam? Of course not. A real bank (traditional bank) holds assets and private property for a fee. That particular institution protects your assets and does not own the assets, but you do. Banks these days and for the better part of the 20th century onward, do not protect your assets, but their own! So, in that sense they are not banks, but scammers fraudulently operating as private enterprice, when in fact they are government agencies (federal instrumentalities).

"Anyway there's good protection mechanisms for higher amounts of money. Hypothetically, let's say you have $2 million in cash. Lets assume the first $250,000 would be in a regular bank account protected by the FDIC (for the sake of simplicity, I'm ignoring other loopholes to squeeze a little more thru the FDIC). You have $1,750,000 unprotected by the FDIC. You use the remaining money to buy securities thru a brokerage which is insured by the SIPC by $500,000. So you have now $1,250,000 uninsured. Guess what, you invested all the $1,750,000 in a brokerage with SIPC insurance and also with Lloyd's of London insurance making your entire money protected from insolvency of a Bank or Brokerage (Again, protected from firm insolvency but not loss of value by bad investments). Here is an example of what I'm talking from Charles Schwab:

""Account Protection
Customer Securities
Customer securities—such as stocks and bonds that are fully paid for or excess margin securities—are segregated from broker-dealer securities in compliance with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Customer Protection Rule. This is a legal requirement for all U.S. broker-dealers. In the unlikely event of insolvency of a broker-dealer, these segregated assets are not available to general creditors and are protected against creditors' claims. There are reporting and auditing requirements in place by government regulators to help ensure all broker-dealers comply with this rule.

Additional brokerage insurance is provided to Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. accounts through underwriters in London.

"Money only has purchasing power by 2 ways (that I know of):

1) It is forced upon its users so that they value the money based on tangible assets and historical prices.

2) The users naturally find ways to trade money so that they can purchase tangible assets.

Neither way guarantees purchasing power with some or any of the money you previously or could possible trade in the future.

The reason why the government has what we consider ""stable supply"" is because they enforce the regulations of how much supply can circulate at any time *and* they enforce the usage of the that currency so they know how much supply should be in circulation at any time.

If the people decide they don't want to use the governments fraudulent scam money anymore, then the government is powerless to enforce it. They enforce it now by introducing fear into the masses by way of a few examples and loudly shout those examples as deterrents whenever somebody gets the notion that what they are doing is illegal.

The other way, by users naturally occurring usage, is only as good as the users of that money deem fit to use. Such decentralized, unregulated uses can never be regulated because then they would fall under 1) and stop being natural.

Your doubt is well founded. There is no framework setup by the government to dictate what should happen when the debt of the Federal Government can no longer be increased. This can happen many ways, and I'm not going to get into all of that unless you show me your more curious and prudent.

> You don't have the right to remove your land from the US

Remove my land from the US? I don't understand. I have the right to my land as it resides in the US because I am the owner. If I remove my land from the US, then my land is no longer recognized as being owned by me.

>, and the government has the right to take control of any property via eminent domain (though they have to pay you ""fairly"" for it).

That isn't actually correct. Government has the recognized right to demand eminent domain with just cause and pay you handsomely for it. In this sense, they do not own or have the right to take any property. Everything the government does must be justified. Because of that limitation, they do not own the land, otherwise they could just do whatever they wanted with it and not pay you at all.

> They also sort of own your money,

Government doesn't own ""your"" money. The people own lawful money, the government regulated private enterprise to create private money for use in and outside of the federal government. 

> in the sense that you can't do whatever you want with the physical bills.

Government doesn't create any limitations on the physical bills, the private corporation does. Government enforces those private laws because it has an interest in keeping those bills in circulation for itself to function.

> Defacing them is illegal

Defacing a bill is illegal if that bill is a private credit note from the Federal Reserve Banks corporation, because that is their property and the condition for them loaning the federal government is that the federal government prosecute anyone that destroys their property. Otherwise they would actually have to bring a lawsuit to the courthouse and there would be a named party. They don't want to be named, because then people would know who the scammers are, so they've done a little trickery here to make you think the government is the one that is enforcing the law, but their hands are just tied in the manner.

Additionally, defacing any property that you own is 100% legal all of the time. You could, for example, own a bill printed by the U.S. Treasury before the Federal Reserve Private corporate monopoly scam. And defacing that bill would not be illegal.

"Rights exist as positive or negative rights. Libertarians tend to believe in negative rights, that you should have freedom *from* others interfering with you. Lefties tend to think you should have positive rights, rights to healthcare, housing, a job etc. This second class of rights have issues in that they tend to trample on the rights, particularly the negative rights of others.

In a libertarian view, the banks have a right to do business with who they choose. You have no right to be banked by a private institution. In this situation, it is complicated by the fact that the banks would quite likely be happy to do business with anyone who they can make money from but they are being interfered with by the government, either directly via legislation or by threats, real or implied. This is an infringement of the rights of both the banks and those seeking to do business with them (free association).

So I think it is important that we be clear about which rights are being infringed here and by who.

"(f) PAYMENT OF INSURED DEPOSITS.-- (1) IN GENERAL.--In case of the liquidation of, or other closing or winding up of the affairs of, any insured depository institution, payment of the insured deposits in such institution shall be **made by the Corporation as soon as possible** , subject to the provisions of subsection (g), either by cash or by making available to each depositor a transferred deposit in a new insured depository institution in the same community or in another insured depository institution in an amount equal to the insured deposit of such depositor. 

That only says “as soon as possible” and sets absolutely no time limit or maximum. Taken to the extreme, it might be impossible for the FDIC to ever make depositors whole again, and this is one of dozens of such “outs” that exist in the document. Remember, this act was written in 1933 when money was gold, times were uncertain, and government lawyers were exceedingly careful to avoid locking the government into any possible financial black holes. 

And the FDIC Act is very clear to spell out that the only insurance funds available to depositors are those that exist within the fund itself: 

(f)(1)(A) all payments made pursuant to this section on account of a closed Bank Insurance Fund member shall be made only from the Bank Insurance Fund 

IF THEY ARE OUT OF MONEY ITS NOT POSSIBLE.  All it will take is an act of Congress. The FDIC is a fig leaf a Legal Fiction.

They would probably just print enought to cover the balances and say ""good luck buying bread with 1 000 000 SEK now""

> any nation treasury holds 1:1 fairly accuired reserves 

Most governments (actual governments, not corporate monopoly organzations that call themselves governements) have specific provisions in their charters for issuing money and backing that money with tangible assets. Its just more profitable to the wrong thing then the right thing.

> What will happen when a country issues 4 trillion SEK and its GDP is 5 trillion?

Thats not necessarily a problem. Corporations that loan out the printed reserves just need to ensure that the collateral they are using for those notes are tangible and under their control. If they loose control of the real property they have guaranteed as payment or if the property becomes scorched earth, then the fallout is no more money can be printed under that system. This has far reaching consequences with respect to being able to import/export out of the country. It essentially amounts to complete chaos and society as a whole is brought back to the primitive age of being fiscally responsible. In other words, people would have to work hard again, and those that didn't, wouldn't eat. On the other hand, if the corporation wishes to print upto and over its GDP it can do that and function quite normally depending on a few factors. Look into Japan on how their banks loan directly from the government via buying corporate bonds. They currently have 200% of GDP ad debt (FIAT outstanding) and are functioning quite well.

"> Can't believe people on a crypto forum are demanding the government force banks to serve people they don't want to.

Please point where me, at least, said such thing. What I find amazing is how people cannot fucking READ, this happens often here. People read far more than what is literally written.

I opened this thread for a discussion about it, not to ask for regulations, not to say there isn't some stupid law allowing banksters to steal us, but to fucking discuss it.

Those rights there are being hurt in my view, and that's it.

> So all the other countries invested in the USD are just holding a sham

No, not necessarily at least. Federal Reserve Notes are printed for use (originally intended) by the US Federal Corporation for all affairs public and private outside of the country. They are notes that the federal government uses as a credit line to interact with entities outside the several states and the citizens of those states who are not public officials. The federal government (corporation) gets to do with whatever it pleases with those notes. At least, the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 clearly states that to be the case.

So, its not a sham for any foreign entity to hold/use/or otherwise transact with federal reserve notes. Those foreign entities are doing exactly what those notes were originally printed for!!

> no other country’s economist are smart enough to figure out the American sham dollar 

Wait, what? Other countries get to use/spend/interact with the US Federal Corporation by way of the federal reserve note banking policies. Any country that accepts those notes are investing the future potential of that corporation. I don't see any problem with this. Other countries may have to invest in those dollars in order to also be granted security and privileges with regards to accessing the economic benefits that they are protecting. This seems to all make sense for a foreign nation/state/king/prince/island of people to do. What doesn't make sense, in any slight recognition of the terms i'm presenting here, is for natural American citizens to interact with the foreign state (federal corporation) in any way during the natural course of most of their lives. Unless you have a specific reason for interstate commerce or conducting illegal activities that would require a license, then you have no use for federal reserve notes at all. The scam isn't that the notes exist and are being used, the scam is that people think they are using lawful, public money when in fact they are using bad debt from a private corporation that only wishes to usurp their property, labor, and equity for their own nefarious gains. The scam is where actual people who consider themselves government know very well that this economy is propped up by an impossible money scam and they aren't telling the american people because then the Federal Reserve Banks corporation would stop buying up bonds (as collateral), and the gravy train would come to a halt and those officals would actually have to be fiscally responsible and accountable for their actions. 

You honestly think politicians, judges, and any other public officials that recognizes this scam is going to relinquish their pensions and salaries while accepting more liabilities to ""do the right thing"" and possibly go to jail/ostracized from society? 

> are smart enough to figure out the American sham dollar but you are

I'm not smart enough to really convince people of anything, so I've found anyways. But I do a lot of research and I read a lot of opinions by supreme court judges, and one thing is for sure, if people did 1% of the work I've done to understand all of this, we wouldn't be in this predicament right now.

"Thats incorrect sir. Banks are federal instrumentalities and as such have been delegated certain tasks normally handled by the government. For all purposes they operate under, they are in fact government. 

What this means is that they are only obligated to provide the services that the government would employ. Meaning, they can deny any service that the government would not also need.

Another note on your sentence:

> they don’t have to grant you rights 

The government only grants rights where those rights are not found naturally in by the beholder of those rights. Meaning, any right the government creates they have unlimited capacity to regulate that right. In essence, a right is not something that can be regulated, so in practice the government can only grant privileges to the access of their own creations. Since the government has completely delegated the creation on money supply to the federal government and they have completely delegated that responsibility to the Federal Reserve Board and they have completely delegated that responsibility to the Federal Reserve Banks corporation, then all money that is regulated by the banks are privileges to to the citizen by way of the private -> public bridge that government has fraudulently created for itself. What this means is that a Citizen no longer gets to enjoy public, lawful money and so they have to demand it under remedy of the laws that were created that govern international commerce. If a citizen does this, then they pull themselves out of the binding clauses of the privileges they would normally have and utilize the rights they already had.

"> government doesn’t need to lend people mortgages or money at all, 

Correct.


> If banks didn’t do this, they would fail.

Correct, there would be no need.


> Banks provide necessary services for people

Incorrect. They (current banks, not traditional banks) provide services for people that want to spend more than they have. Not necessarily a bad thing, but thats what they do.

> government insures and protects those people through regulations and laws.

Incorrect. The government insures and protects their money through regulations and laws. Where their money is necessary for them to function and provide for the general welfare of the people.

> Banks interact with the government in a unique way

By being contracting with government, banks are government. Banks receive notes from the federal reserve banks corporation through bonds issued by the federal government. Everything except for the private corporation (the fed) is regulated. The Federal Reserve Board has also delegated their responsibility to the Federal Reserve Banks corporation as well.

> The Fed is the government

Incorrect. The current ""Federal Government"" is a private corporation and not de jur government. Federal government exists as a private enterprise to regulate interstate commerce, but the what is called ""Federal Government"" has had to fufil those duties for sometime.

> banks are not

Sort of not. All banks are governement agencies employed by the federal government which is a private organization. The fact that Congress has delegated all of its responsibilities and duties to the private organization makes them publicly accountable. All publicly accountable agencies, organs, officials, entities are government because they are regulated by its authority. 

There are banks that exist that do not touch the scam money monopoly and as such are not considered federal reserve private banks, but private banks. Those banks are not publicly accountable and no regulations of government are required for them to function as are required for all banks that operate in that way.

"The only conditions that can limit the free use of speech (that I know of) are:

1) Creating injury to another. (starting a riot in your example), but telling people to do bad things is immoral, but not necessary illegal

2) Obstructing justice or attempting to manipulate/bribe officials or jury members.

3) Producing content that would be covered under commerce laws. I.e. you cannot reproduce content (speech) while making commercial profits when there are exist restrictions in place to doing so.

"Any number of criteria. 

In the US for example, Reg E requires financial institutions to recover funds lost for a customer due to fraud from an EFT. There is room for abuse. All you have to do is allege fraud, and it is up to the business (Coinbase, etc) to prove you were the one who authorized the transaction. If it can’t be proven or is not proven sufficiently, you will be reimbursed. If the bank can not recover funds from the business, they still have to reimburse you which results in a loss for the bank. It’s completely within the banks right to block transactions to a business that has a high rate of fraud chargebacks, to both lower loss exposure for them (the bank) as a business entity and protect the consumer. 

Do I think that’s what’s going on? Honestly, maybe. I think it’s a reasonable guess. 

However, I think it’s more likely that risk officers do not understand crypto. 

I also think the most likely scenario is that Coinbase was not processing transfers as a cash advance (until supposedly the other day, Visa now codes them as cash advances.) This is regulated, too. And a very big deal for AML compliance. 

I completely agree: It is bullshit that banks are blocking the transactions. But I believe this collective circlejerk about “it’s my money, it’s my right, it’s a conspiracy and banks are trying to kill crypto” is completely off base, misinformed, and the absolute wrong way to go about correcting the issue.
