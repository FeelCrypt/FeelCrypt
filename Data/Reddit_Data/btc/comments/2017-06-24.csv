My paper analyzes the real bitcoin network and measures the effect there.  Its the mining pool software. If it requests a new block from Satoshi clients and the block cannot be provided (because bitcoind is still DLing the prev block or txns), then the pool SW provides an empty block so the hash power does not sit idle.;1;1;False;thezerg1;djbrkyf;Bitcoin is no longer just annoying, but now literally unusable.

"Its how the network works.  Its an unavoidable result of block and txn propagation over a worldwide network whose max speed physically can't exceed about 1/3 light in a vacuum.

Look at block sizes before BU existed or read my paper on the subject. ";1;1;False;thezerg1;djbr5n4;Bitcoin is no longer just annoying, but now literally unusable. Blockstream has utterly ruined a great innovation and a fork cannot come fast enough.;http://i.imgur.com/jCBX5q5.png

Okay, well thanks for the info, then.  It is interesting to know that if motivated miners want to prevent excessive block size growth, they at least have the theoretical means to do so.;1;0;False;benjamindees;djc7bbj;Bitcoin is no longer just annoying, but now literally unusable.

"Is magnetism an unintentional side effect or an actual feature?  Does intentionality matter?

I'm not sure what cgminer does, but it doesn't really matter anymore.  EC is something else, it doesn't change block size.  You can change the maximum mined block in BU using bitcoin-cli, so you could produce smaller blocks if lots of larger blocks are being created by other miners or vice-versa.  I don't think that that needs to be adjusted automatically,  but if you do you can always write a simple python or shell script to do it.

I hope I've piqued your and other reader's interest about this aspect of the bitcoin network but at this point it'll be more efficient for you to do some googling...";1;1;False;thezerg1;djc6tg5;Bitcoin is no longer just annoying, but now literally unusable.

That's fine.  I believe you, in theory.  I'm just wondering what software actually works to limit the blocksize in that way.  Which mining software makes the actual decision to mine empty blocks when the ideal blocksize is exceeded?  Do any of them actually do that?;1;1;False;benjamindees;djbrd5t;Bitcoin is no longer just annoying, but now literally unusable.

Is that how BU works?  It mines empty blocks?;1;1;False;benjamindees;djbnbd4;Bitcoin is no longer just annoying, but now literally unusable. Blockstream has utterly ruined a great innovation and a fork cannot come fast enough.;http://i.imgur.com/jCBX5q5.png
Okay, but that seems like more of an unintentional side-effect than an actual feature.  What if I want to solo mine?  Does cgminer, for instance, work the same way?  Does BU refuse to provide blocks when the configured (EC) rate has been exceeded?  Can this feature be added to BU?  Has that been discussed?;1;1;False;benjamindees;djbrsvy;Bitcoin is no longer just annoying, but now literally unusable.
