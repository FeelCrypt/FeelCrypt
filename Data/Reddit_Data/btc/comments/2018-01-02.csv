"> No Ripple will be created beyond what is already created.

That is a baseless claim to which there is no evidence to support. Bitcoin has a 21 million unit hard cap in the code, it is not possible for there to be greater than 21 million bitcoins and if there are, it is not Bitcoin. 

XRP has no such property. They can be created out of thin air for zero cost, that is how the existing supply of 100 billion XRP was created, of which the banks own the majority of.

Anyone trading real, decentralized, blockchain based currencies with a limited supply for the worthless XRP tokens that have no cost to create and can be issued at will, is a victim. This is highway robbery. 

Most of the people buying XRP are noobs that don't understand these facts. No real cryptocurrency/blockchain enthusiasts support XRP. (Remember, XRP has no blockchain.)

> This is not a fiat currency.

And the sky is not blue. 

With respect, get your head out of your ass.

The tokens are created out of thin air, by a centralized issuing entity. 38 billion were made available to the public but 62 billion are held on reserves by banks. 

As well, there is nothing fundamentally limiting their ability to create more. No blockchain to track issuance. No proof of work is being performed to back the transactions. There is no cost to create the tokens since it does not require proof of work. 

**They literally just change numbers on a computer.** 

And suckers are paying upwards of $2 per unit for the tokens. Go figure. 

If you can't see that is the exact same thing as fiat just disguised as a cryptocurrency then you need to do more research into the differences between the two. 

However, the information I have presented to you thus far is more than enough for you to begin to understand the difference.

"Every single thing I said is true and you can independently verify any of it yourself. So no need to point a finger at it and scream ""wrong"" without backing your claims. 

Seems to me you are invested in XRP but you don't know the first thing about it. You don't like these truths because they go against what you probably thought when you bought into XRP. 

Well, continuing to lie to yourself will only hurt you in the long run. 

And by the way you've got to be utterly clueless if you don't know most of the XRP are held by institutions. You might as well try arguing that the state of California does not exist on a map.

"1) It would be perfectly economical to move 1BTC and any other amount on chain with bigger blocks. As far as profitability goes: Even a subcent fee will be enough for miners with world adoption. With giga or terra blocks this subcent-fee adds up to a significant amount.

2) LN has the purpose to handle small value transactions. 1 BTC is not a small value transaction.

3) you would still have to broadcast your 1BTC Transmission back to the chain so you would still make an on-chain transaction as the receiving end of that money.

"Because in ether there's not an artificially low supply cap so it can't settle on something predictable. And they did have some wild fees the first couple adjustments as the network got used to the periodic gas limit increases.

When supply is artificially low, your action of deciding a fee and the future actions of fees need to be predicted in order to reliably choose a fee price. There's an actually game theory bit that someone went into details before too but I can't seem to find it at the moment.

TLDR, it works well with others because the supply of transaction space isn't artificially limited, that limit forces you to predict the unpredictable future to be efficient.";2;0;False;chalbersma;ds2kr52;"I signed a 1.27 USD fee transaction 3 weeks ago.

Entirely expected, as there is less activity over the holiday season.  Also, people stop transacting when they see how expensive and unreliable it is - the norm over the last year has been that there usually are periods with idle capacity over the weekends, where transactions with very low fee gets confirmed.  /u/jstolfi has even  predicted that there will always be periods with idle capacity as the capacity limit is actively killing demand, personally I'm not so sure as rational actors will always throw in low-fee-transactions with RBF enabled in order to consolidate their wallets and do other low-priority transactions.;3;0;False;tobixen;ds2mnwl;"I signed a 1.27 USD fee transaction 3 weeks ago.

"I'd say that the Bitcoin system does not handle ""full blocks"" very well.  As I see it, this was a theoretical problem before 2016-03, and for us it continues being a theoretical problem after 2017-08, but what happens if the network gets really spammed by lots of transactions with really low transaction fee?

I tend to believe the solution is a network-wise consensus on what a minimum transaction fee should be.  Currently, in the BCH ecosystem, this seems to be 1 satoshi / byte, and currently I can hardly imagine that anyone would want to afford spamming the BCH blockchain so much that legitimate transactions (defined as those paying more than 1 satoshi / byte) get stuck for weeks.";1;1;False;tobixen;ds2wscy;"I signed a 1.27 USD fee transaction 3 weeks ago.

The mempool timeout should never have been increased beyond three days. In fact it ought to be even smaller, perhaps only one hour. That way a payment will fail quickly, so it can be sent again. You should not have to wait two weeks before retrying your send.

"Thatâ€™s grand.  Faulting me for not backing claims but donâ€™t do it yourself.   Your link really didnâ€™t prove anything.  Your also sidestepping the significant institutional and government ownership of bitcoin. 

Iâ€™m invested in multiple coins. XRP is one of them.   There is money to be made backing the decentralized plays and the corporate plays, of which Ripple is obviously ahead of the group on. 

Right now 55 billion of the xrp is out of circulation and in escrow.  So they are not held by anyone at this time.  

The coin is meant for interbank cross boarder currency transfers. Of course banks will carry a large portion of it.  I want them to.  I hope to see more than the 100 banks already signed on.  

The coin has a lot more in store than an alternative to swift, but your probably too close minded to consider it because your an idealist. You probably donâ€™t have a clue what I am talking about. 

So all the FUD you want to spout is fine but your not as savvy as you may believe.   You come across as something of a know it all prick frankly.  And you donâ€™t really know much about Ripple other than the same old tired talking points. 

My point still stands. Ripple has faster and cheaper transactions than most popular PoW coins , you have yet to acknowledge it.   

So feel free to set up a remindme and come back in two years to tell me how wrong I am

">One thing I've observed to be a problem is ""ghost transactions"", transactions that are visible at some nodes but not all. If the wallet believes the transaction is gone, it may be difficult to do RBF or CPFP. ....

Yes! I've encountered such transactions more then once when using the Electrum wallet for BTC and wanting to increase the fee on a stuck transaction. Some Electrum servers don't see the transaction, so it won't appear in the history. Configuring Electrum to use a different server will make the transaction appear again in the history, allowing it to be rebroadcast with a higher fee.

Problems like this clearly indicate that the Bitcoin Core system is badly broken.

Did you calculate the value of the BCH at the time of the transaction? Based on the the trading range on January 1st, it looks like it was valued at $56 or $57, which, on the one hand, isn't bad considering you are turning an asset into cold hard cash. But it's also about 12-14% profit for them. Again, I don't have a feel for how much profit is reasonable for providing such an exchange, but I wouldn't say there was no fee.;4;3;False;rich_fucker;ds36243;More adoption.

"> Both bitcoin and bitcoin cash have conflicting transactions all the time. The nodes don't reject them. They accept both and the miners pick whichever pays more.

No, without RBF nodes only accept 1 tx with input x and y. If you would send another tx using input x and y it would get rejected by the node. So unless you are extremely fast (2 seconds) in getting your double-spend tx included in the node's mempool it wouldn't work. 0-Conf is not flawed, but the whole double spend etc stuff is just not worth it for the amount of money vendors would accept with 0-conf.

"I wouldn't do any of this. I'm not a criminal. I can tell you with certainty though that people will absolutely do it for any amount of money. 

Can you point to the code on github where they changed the conflicting transaction behavior? BCH is a fork of bitcoin and as of yet I've heard no news on changing this behavior. And again, in any event, this does not protect against 0-conf double spends. It makes it marginally more difficult, but is in no way an assurance for merchants.

"> When using exchanges my buy/sell orders are obviously off-chain. But deposits and withdrawals are not. Day traders and people running arbitrage between exchanges pull money in and out of the exchanges multiple times a day. So that whole quite substantial chunk of the transaction load could be reduced with just a very minimal adoption of a relatively basic LN

LN only works for small payments, most traders that are pulling money to an from the exchange will be moving large amounts of funds in the order of a few bitcoin ( or you would be better leaving those coins on the exchange ). If an exchange wanted to facilitate large LN network transactions they would need to fund a channel with most of their cold storage bitcoin. This would present additional security risks, you are trusting no malware will have access to your hot lighting network node.

Alot exchange transactions are also one directional eg fiat in bitcoin out or the other way around. Lightning network will never work for these transactions. 

If i was moving 10 BTC, i from an exchange I am happy to pay high bitcoin fees for fast onchain transactions wouldn't care about 20-50 dollar fee's. I wouldn't be happy locking up 20 BTC in a channel so I can send this. Also i believe the maximum LN transaction  is 0.1 BTC

LN basically is for multiple small transactions, otherwise you would have to keep funding your channel for every transaction you would be better off using basic bitcoin transactions 

Typical use case is, you open a channel for 0.5 btc then use this channel to pay for games, VPN subscription and what ever small purchases you make in a year.  Sadly block stream has eliminated 100% of theses use cases, they wont magically appear again once its economically viable.

I didn't say that. I said Roger Ver thinks unlimited blocksize is acceptable.

"Well said

The root of the scaling challenge is that on blockchain, every mining node need to participate in the verification of each TX, thus TXs need to propagate to all of them, which in turn increase the bandwidth and processing requirement, depends on how many nodes each node connects to 



LN is trying to make TX data between A and B only propagate between themselves, thus rest of the nodes do not need to know about their TX, and saving bandwidth



As a result, TXs that are not sent to the rest of the network can not be verified by major hash power, thus become insecure. So LN decided to take the deposit (channel opening) TX and sent it to the network and secured by blockchain, but let the subsequent spending TX rely on P2P communications. And if some of the spending TX went wrong, you either refund the full deposit by sending a punishing TX or accept the loss because the fee is too high to send such a punishing TX



So it is compromising the in-channel transaction security in exchange for less TXs broadcasted on chain. But is this compromising really worth it? Why don't simply increase the bandwidth and hardware capacity of mining nodes and still maintain full security with all on-chain transactions? That seems to be a much more robust one-approach-to-rule-them-all solution";3;0;False;vattenj;ds22knb;Elizabeth Stark of Lightning Labs admits that a hostile actor can steal funds in LN unless you broadcast a transaction on-chain with a cryptographic proof that recovers the funds.

"Let me rephrase that. Will correct the paragraph above.

When a transaction happens on LN, it is not confirmed by the Blockchain. It is first confirmed by the LN, and then the channel where the transaction happened will need to be closed before the sum of the aggregate of transactions can be confirmed on the Blockchain. So before the value of a LN transaction can be confirmed on the Blockchain, miners will still need to confirm it.

TLDR:

Transactions confirmed by the LN but not by miners are not confirmed in the Blockchain. Doing this is fine, but users should be aware that there can be all sorts of ""funny"" accounting happening on their channel that may or may not destroy the value of their side because it has NOT yet been confirmed into the Blockchain.

"The market will choose BCH if they want bigger blocksize.  They won't bother begging BlockStream/Bilderberg Core for it.  They have already proven they won't even do a measly 2MB increase and will risk a split and collapse of the entire network.  Bitcoin Core will never raise blocksize without a nasty split, and why split again? We already have the big block split, its BCH.

[Forkius Maximus also breaks this down](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7ndkvm/elizabeth_stark_of_lightning_labs_admits_that_a/ds134be/):

> Perhaps more to the point, LN wouldn't work (even in principle) with full blocks. Yet Core is deadset on full blocks. That means LN cannot be a solution for any Core supporter.

> Anyone who thinks BTC can solve its massive fee problems without forking away from Core is dreaming, and anyone who wakes up from this dream will realize the fork away from Core has already happened: it's called Bitcoin Cash.
