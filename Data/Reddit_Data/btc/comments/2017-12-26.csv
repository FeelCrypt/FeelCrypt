Lol. Dude you have no idea what you are talking about. Why would anyone care about creating volume off chain? That isn’t even real volume... Also I transfer my tips to my own wallet. Why wouldn’t I? Haha. Why would I just send them around to other people to create volume. Why should I give a fuck about volume? I just like being tipped in something I can actually use.;1;0;False;SuperSonic6;drrxx0m;This Guy Is Going Around Reddit Giving People Gifts of BCH Can We Get An Appreciation Post For Him?;7lybxy;https://i.redd.it/awfkoed0ky501.jpg
"I have received a lot of tips of bitcoin cash but I never even really seen bitcoin tips happen for anyone, and it’s obvious why...

...because Bitcoin doesn't need to create fake volume. Also, your noob is showing.


the difference is that you could never transfer your tips to your own wallet because of the fees. I mean even if I collected $10 in tips I wouldn’t actually get to spend any of that bitcoin....

No one it transferring it to their own wallets, they're just tipping it backwards and forwards to create fake volume.

Kinda funny how the offchain tipper is essentially tabs, and functions kinda like LN.


Notice how my comments have not been voted down, despite them being anti bcash in the bcash forum... That's because what I'm saying is factually correct.

"But bch and classic bitcoin implemention has already solved the problem, it requires a very minimal amount of work to increase blocksize and get consensus. Bitcoin core has kept the platform artificially limited by not increasing block sizes for arbitrary reasons and then shoehorns their own proprietary solution into it, which still doesn't solve the problem.

"$150 gets you a hard drive which covers full 8MB blocks, the current size of Bitcoin Cash.

Cheap, huh? Because storage follows Moore's law.

Now what happens if/when Bitcoin scales to become the global cash payment system, on chain?

Well that means 7 billion people making ~50 transaction a day.

That's the entire global population participating in Bitcoin Cash.

That will incentivize ten of thousands of entities to run nodes so they can capitalize on that economic activity. Who cares if you can't run a node on your Raspberry Pi? That was **never** the intent should Bitcoin (Cash) become this wildly successful.

So let's compare the two scenarios.

Bitcoin (Cash) scales to allow everyone on Earth to make transactions. Yet ""only"" >100,000 nodes will exist.

Bitcoin doesn't scale, practically no one is able to make a transaction, but hey, you can spend your electricity to verify rich people's transactions. Woo hoo.

"**Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Ether, Oh My! What’s With All the Bitcoin Clones?**

*An explainer on what exactly are ‘altcoins,’ why they exist and what makes them different*

Bitcoin’s wild ride has gotten a huge amount of attention. But over the past two weeks, some of its crypto cousins, like litecoin and Bitcoin Cash, have muscled their way into the spotlight.

On Tuesday, for instance, bitcoin-services company Coinbase announced it would list and support Bitcoin Cash, which is an alternative version of bitcoin that launched on Aug. 1. The news sent prices of bitcoin down and Bitcoin Cash skyrocketing.

Plenty of people are confused enough about bitcoin. Alternatives to bitcoin, or “altcoins,” muddy the waters further. Here are answers to some basic questions about them.

**Altcoins? What are altcoins?**

Altcoin is a nickname given to currencies that are a variation on bitcoin. The way bitcoin itself was created encourages this. When bitcoin’s anonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto released bitcoin in 2009, he or she did it as an open-source software project. That means that, unlike say the code for Microsoft Windows, anybody could take the program, reconfigure it and launch their own version. Litecoin was the first to do this, in 2011.

**Are there many of these altcoins?**

Yep. A research website called coinmarketcap.com recently listed 1,374 altcoins. Most are marginal at best. About 300 of them, with names like PinkDog, MagicCoin and BitSoar, have no measurable market. But there are a handful that have a legitimate shot at becoming viable online currencies.

**Which ones seem viable?**

Ethereum, also known as ether, is probably the most popular. As of Friday, it had a $60 billion market value, second only to bitcoin, and has attracted a sizable community of developers and entrepreneurs. Ripple and litecoin are also popular. And Bitcoin Cash grew far bigger this week; it rose 60% in one day, and its market value stood at about $40 billion, after Coinbase said it would list the coin.

**How do these other coins compare in size and performance to bitcoin?**

All of them are smaller than bitcoin. Some have larger circulating supplies—there are 38 billion ripple tokens, for example—and some have had larger gains this year on a percentage basis. Ethereum’s up 7,600% this year, and ripple has risen about 15,000%. Bitcoin is up about 1,200%.

**Why do people even want altcoins if they have bitcoin?**

It is a bet on the future. For all the success of bitcoin, there is no guarantee it will remain the dominant cryptocurrency. Everything in this market is highly speculative.

**Who created these other currencies?**

Some have known creators, some don’t. Charlie Lee created litecoin. Vitalik Buterin created ethereum. In the case of Bitcoin Cash, it was a group of developers and businesses who weren’t satisfied with the existing configuration of bitcoin. Prominent and early supporters included Roger Ver, an early bitcoin investor nicknamed “Bitcoin Jesus,” and Jihan Wu, the co-founder of a big Chinese mining company called Bitmain. A developer named Amaury Sechet wrote the initial code that allowed the fork.

**Fork?**

A fork is a term for a new version of a software program. Bitcoin is really nothing more than software, a program that allows two people to make an exchange of value. Because nobody owns that software, anybody can “fork” it, can create their own version of it. Bitcoin Cash and all these other altcoins are really just versions of the bitcoin program.

**How is Bitcoin Cash Different from bitcoin?**

In most respects, it is similar to bitcoin. It works the same way, and it has the exact same transaction history as the original bitcoin, up to Aug. 1, 2017. Its primary difference is that it is designed to allow more transactions to pass through, on a per-second basis, than bitcoin, which leads to lower user fees. And, of course, because it is a different market, Bitcoin Cash’s price moves independent of bitcoin itself.

**Why do I care?**

Some people have looked at Bitcoin Cash as a virtual dividend for bitcoin holders. Some see it as an easy arbitrage play. Others see Bitcoin Cash in a pitched philosophical battle against bitcoin. Indeed, its existence is the result of a fight within the bitcoin industry that at times has been more like a religious war. It has grown only more partisan and bitter as bitcoin has become more valuable.

**Do we need another version of bitcoin?**

Well, cryptocurrency is the epitome of an open market. Anybody can come along and offer a product. Bitcoin’s backers created this opening for Bitcoin Cash by not allowing any changes in the underlying code that would have allowed more transactions to fit through the network.

They have their reasons for that. But as bitcoin has grown in popularity, the result has been a situation where transactions get stuck in a bottleneck. If you want to get your transaction processed fast, you need to attach a voluntary fee.

Those “voluntary” fees have reached an average cost of about $30 per transaction. That makes bitcoin virtually unusable for all but very large transactions. The Bitcoin Cash crowd is just trying to offer a solution to that problem.

**Are there other differences among the different altcoins?**

Ethereum is a platform for hosting apps, a decentralized operating system. Ripple is designed for interbank payments. Even more than the design itself, though, the big difference is in the communities around each asset. Bitcoin has a community that has been growing over nine years. It has experienced developers, and virtually every business in the industry recognizes it. Bitcoin Cash, among others, doesn’t have that yet. For altcoins, expanding the base of developers and supporters is almost as important as the code.

Ethereum and litecoin have their own groups of developers and supporters, working to build and expand their own networks.

**I just got into bitcoin. Do the altcoins affect me?**

The existence of these other coins doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with bitcoin, and you can buy and sell any of them independently. On the other hand, while there is a competition among these coins, at times they move in tandem, like stocks on a day when the whole market is way up.

**How important was the Coinbase move with Bitcoin Cash?**

Coinbase has emerged as the biggest bitcoin exchange, and it has become a company that is closest to the mainstream. Its app has become one of the most downloaded, and it has one of the largest user bases in the industry. So what it does carries weight.

**Does Coinbase support any other altcoins?**

Coinbase allows trading of bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, litecoin and ethereum.

**What happens now?**

The price and market value of Bitcoin Cash, ethereum, litecoin and others will probably get the most attention. But what matters much more to their future is adoption.

Will people and businesses frustrated by bitcoin’s high fees migrate to these other currencies? Will software developers start working on them, and will businesses use and build apps for them or one particular altcoin?

Meanwhile, bitcoin will always be the original, and still has the largest “network effect” around it, but in tech, being first or best doesn’t always tell you who succeeds. Anyone remember Betamax or Netscape?

"Lightening Network isn't even a remote threat to Bitcoin Cash. Even if LN were here now:

Bitcoin Cash 0-conf transactions are actually faster than a LN transaction.

Bitcoin Cash 0-conf transactions are not limited by the smallest intermediate channel size.

Bitcoin Cash transactions do not require a prepaid bond.

Bitcoin Cash transactions do not require a timelocked bond transaction fee to be estimated months in advance.

Bitcoin Cash 0-conf transactions are completely unaffected by network congestion.

Bitcoin Cash 0-conf transactions provides a natural surge capability. 

Bitcoin Cash transactions do not need to use a completely different system if the payment is too large.

"Every time somebody complains about high fees, the Core/Blockstream trolls come out in full swing, armed with some transactions **that still require high fees** but not so high as the one the complaint is about.

So if somebody thinks that $30 is too high, these trolls will point to an isolated example of a fee as low as $4.00 and claim that that is not high.

There are two big flaws in their trolling strategy. First, occasional lower fees mean nothing. Second, anything more than around $0.05 for a typical non-complex transaction is too high.

Look at the way Bitcoin used to be, when fees were in the $0.00–$0.06 range. Were it not for the tiny blocks that the Core/Blockstream trolls claim to worship, fees would still be in that range.

"Hi Pine  🍍, 
Hope you went through my comment which I emailed to you regarding screening some African based charities which are worth recommending and are definitely doing what they say they are doing in their communities ... As a social empowerment advocate for the past 8 years in Africa, I have personally witnessed so many so called charities and fraudsters take advantage of the misfortune and desperate state of innocent lives to detour and mismanage funds without providing sustainable solutions to the intended beneficiaries they claim to support.

There is need for thorough screening because informed giving is effective giving. Reason why I will like in my humble person, for you to strongly consider these organizations for the Pineapple Fund, which are putting in the work to create real differences in the lives of their benefactors even with insufficient funds.

Areas include ;

1. Digital philanthropy and education as well as promote learning equality for children in low resource localities

"Fuck tax deductions and armies of accountants. There is no law of the universe that says there is only one shitty way to fund projects and cooperate.

I'm not an economist and just in the planning stage. But the idea is an economy based on consent, not coercion. We should look at other ways to share resources and organize labor. Some aspects would be a lot like crowdfunding, as a citizen you would have control of where a small chunk of public money ends up, split amongst projects. This mechanism should be balanced with some fixed budget items and other controls to stay predictible. This economy needs long term contracts with consistent funding.

When society is radically fucked I look for solutions outside the framework. Like a restart if and when a collapse or political revolution starts. I want to be ready and talking about a more humane common sense world.

Pretty much. But let’s examine your proposals...


> People should be able to direct their tax money straight to programs and public investments that they choose. 


No, in general, average people cannot properly allocate money. We need better trained politicians. 


> We need a basic income (not welfare that goes away when you work) so automation is a blessing not a threat. Basic income keeps the economy more predictable, and money flows, therefore it is more efficient. 


This would possibly be nice. 



> A consumer economy needs consumers with disposable income.


Should we all consume more though? Wouldn’t that be a problem for the limits of growth? 


We’re rapidly liquidating the planet’s resources already, and your policies are 

1. to let people directly vote on tax law (how this would even work, who knows? Who makes the proposals people vote on? What makes you think average people are any good at all with allocating money? Have you seen their credit card bills?), 

2. and to encourage faster resource burn by incentivizing and allowing for rapidly increasing consumption. 

What, are you an accelerationist? Unless you’re an acceerationist*, this is a bad idea. 

*Accelerationists believe we’re all fucked so we might as well consume as fast as possible in order to bring on the inevitable collapse as fast as possible such that less people are affected by it when it comes.

This is **pure speculation** but I suspect Adam Back and other core developers have been compromised by intelligence operations, they could be direct agents of CIA and MI6 either voluntarily for money and prestige or under duress or blackmail, for example Back was basically a disgruntled nobody who Satoshi had read his papers long ago and mentioned him, and then something happened well after Bitcoin had already been a huge success that had him suddenly involved and creating this company. Gavin was invited to discuss with CIA very early on, the Satoshi disappeared, he likely rebuffed any attempt to co-opt him, but we can all imagine how that would have been a much different conversation with Mr Back can't we? Do people really think only Gavin was approached? No it's just he has integrity and his ego under control and so he was transparent with it, others would have had their ego stroked and their childish fantasies played to. 

Oh course this will be hard to prove. What we need is a Wikileaks style release of some emails or some evidence. Perhaps we need a bounty for that?

"Also Peter Todd wrote this gem back in 2013. It’s eerily similar to some of the things Core has done/promoted in more recent times. 

> If I were the US Government and had co-opted the ""core"" Bitcoin dev team, you know what I'd do? I'd encourage ground-up alternate implementations knowing damn well that the kind of people dumb enough to work on them expecting to create a viable competitor anytime soon aren't going to succeed. Every time anyone tried mining with one, I'd use my knowledge of all the ways they are incompatible to fork them, making it clear they can't be trusted for mining. Then I'd go a step further and ""for the good of Bitcoin"" create a process by which regular soft-forks and hard-forks happened so that Bitcoin can be ""improved"" in various ways, maybe every six months. Of course, I'd involve those alternate implementations in some IETF-like standards process for show, but all I would have to do to keep them marginalized and the majority of hashing power using the approved official implementation is slip the odd consensus bug into their code; remember how it was recently leaked that the NSA spends $250 million a year on efforts to insert flaws into encryption standards and commercial products. With changes every six months the alts will never keep up. Having accomplished political control, the next step is pushing the development of the Bitcoin core protocol in ways that further my goals, such as scalability solutions that at best allow for auditing, rather waiting until protocols are developed, tested, and accepted by the community that support fully decentralized mining.

If you’ve noticed since the Bitcoin Cash fork a plethora of new forks which have mostly been airdrops and some just plain scams have popped up. This has all been orchestrated to try to fear people until thinking forks in general are bad to try to discredit Bitcoin Cash. 

As we also already know they created this soft fork process to also try to discredit hard forks and introduce buggy code like SegWit making it difficult for any forks to maintain (thankfully Bitcoin Cash devs had the foresight to fork before SegWit was activated). 

There is also a lot of code creep that has been cleaned up in Cash, for example RBF which is a disaster in combination with the new 14-day mempool eviction policy. 

Lastly regarding scalability, we have Lightning (Coming Soonish) which has delayed scaling for ages in the hopes of a working system which will undoubtedly morph into a hub and spoke network that is perfect for auditing centralized players.

">previously they were evicted after maybe one day,

The previous policy was 3 days, now it's 14 days. You can read the logic here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9312 

>3 days (the old time) was already not sufficiently short to protect against an attack that could fill the mempool with high fee rate txs that were somehow not attractive or possible to mine. A longer expiry time will reduce network traffic by less rerelay of low fee txs and will allow transactions to take advantage of weekly cycles in tx volume. By keeping the txs in the mempool, future revisions of fee estimation will be able to provide lower estimates for transactions which are low priority and can wait days or a week to be included in a block.

Very peculiar logic if you ask me. Why would they say transactions with high fees are an attack? Ok, if the transaction is ""not attractive"" (whatever that means) or not possible to mine, the miner would just discard those transactions. The high fees all of a sudden would make the miner mine them? What? In addition, by creating extremely long wait times in the mempool guess what they are doing - yes! - creating an artificially super induced high fee rate market! Doh.

Gregory Maxwell on February 28, 2017 at 03:00 said:

Wow. Another remarkably dishonest article from the authors of Bitcoin Unlimited. (http://archive.is/5cim0 Archive link)

> because only some coins can

Making your transactions non-malleable is a thing you always opt-into because some forms of mallability are an intentional and useful feature. With a segwit using wallet you get non-malleability by default, you can choose to not have it by using things like sighash flags. Obviously if you don’t use a segwit wallet you don’t get the segwit benefit. There is no fungiblity interaction here– any coin can be sent to a segwit wallet and any coins in a segwit wallet can be sent to any other wallet, so that claim is simply untrue.

> SegWit absolutely fails to solve anything related to quadratic hashing.

Again, a complete untruth. Segwit makes transaction hashing strictly linear in the size of the transaction. There is no quadratic component at all, and the hashing CPU time for all transactions with multiple inputs is significantly reduced. Because segwit is backward compatible it doesn’t change older transactions (and couldn’t, without risking confiscating funds) but that is okay because segwit doesn’t increase the capacity for older transactions.

> It adds a new attack vector,

Dishonest miners being able to make malicious blocks that bloat the system isn’t a new attack, but segwit makes the attack better by reducing the much more serious UTXO (https://segwit.org/why-a-discount-factor-of-4-why-not-2-or-8-bbcebe91721e#.qofkg369f bloat attack vector).

I think this point is especially dishonest coming from a BU developer, given that their whole security model is based on a strong assumption that the aggregate behavior of miners is honest. It’s like a guy who sells houses without doorlocks on the basis that people are honest complaining that someone was lowering their security replacing their deadbolt with a combination fingerprint scanner + key lock where the key was somewhat easier to copy.

> LN strongly incentivize centralization

The description given there actually argues the opposite. The funds in channels are required based on the number of channels. Lightning designs today are setup to only build channels as a product of payments you’re already making. Using lightning in a “hub like” way requires extra transactions that you never would have made normally. The big advance of lightning over the prior payment channels proposals is specifically that it doesn’t need hubs.

Recently BU’s “chief scientist” was making exactly the opposite argument based on the same facts: He argued that lightning did not improve scalablity because there would need to be as many channels as users and so when users went up the channel count would go up.

> full blocks equals stealing

This isn’t true– blocks are _always_ effectively full and any system where they aren’t is either irrelevant or subject to censorship. Bitcoin’s incentives depend on full blocks (https://medium.com/@bergealex4/bitcoin-is-unstable-without-the-block-size-size-limit-70db07070a5), as well.. Lightning works fine in the presence of full blocks, and moreover lightning is largely orthogonal to segwit.

> Schnorr cannot deliver any extra capacity

This is simply untrue. Our construction for schnorr aggregation on top of segwit yields over 24% additional capacity in the limit with two outputs and infinitely many inputs, this number is nearly achieved with realistic numbers of inputs like 10 (which achieves a 24.6% capacity increase).

So we have each and every point raised in this blog post are untrue, many absurdly so.

Finally, the untrue claims in this blog post are being plastered all over rBTC but due to actions (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1802320.0) by that subreddit’s moderators I am unable to post a counterargument– not just on rbtc– but anywhere on Reddit. Yet they happily scream about far less limiting actions a censorship.

"But would that not open precedent for more forks in the future? I mean there are now 21 million bitcoin cores and 21 million bitcoin cash. It can't be a good thing that this limited coin supply now has doubled. I still see the fork as a long consensus fight ... and I hope only one of the two survies. If Bitcoin Core gets fixed ... it it's them I am fine with it. But for that to happen they need to loose their political control. Vinay Gupta said it best: 

Bitcoin has political problems rather than technical problems and as long as they are unwilling to admin that, they are stuck.

I think we ARE willing to admit it. And so the solution for now is better politics. Better community building. Better creation of markets. Etc etc. Let Bitcoin Cash focus on user adoption.

But next to that there is another thing that is making every get stuck. The high volatility of prices because of fraud on the crypto exchanges. With this type of volatility no crypto is usable as a currency.

So for 2018 I hope two things. 

- That the fraud on the exchanges get's exposed and that the market corrects back to a more realistic price .. and hopefully another 4 years of a slow rise in price. The 4 years from Mtgox till now where a waste because the project stalled for almost 4 years. After the next MtGox (believe me it's coming) we have the opportunity to keep the price somewhat stable. 

- Leave Bitcoin Core behind for them to become obsolete and loose their political power. 



So we will have to:

1) Spread enough crypto around so there will be an inflow of people that want to use crypto as currency instead of a get rich quick scheme

2) Focus on websites like yours.org and initiative like the brave browser. Crytpo can help end the reign of ads on the internet. Direct funding. Direct contact between content creator and consumer without the ad cmpanies and banks and the other 1000 guys in between. 


3) Hire people over the internet and pay them in crypto so you start getting a real economy going.


This is kind of a quick shit post but you get the general idea.

Crypto is in slavery to fiat. The fiat price is what makes things do forward or backward. The only way to end this is there to be an economy of people getting paid in crypto and buying what they need with crypto.  This will be a very long process and crypto and fiat will have to co-exist for a long time.

But here are no shortcuts here... if we don't focus on building an economy like this nothing will ever happen with crypto because it just won't become money.

"I'll address each point

1. It's not unusable. You pay and your transaction goes through. You can debate about the amount of fees being paid (and they are absurd) but you cannot say it's unusable.

2. Yes, there are solutions coming. LN is currently on testnet and is fully functional there. Feel free to go test it out yourself.

3. It's already delivered on testnet. When your objective is to get things RIGHT rather than get them out ASAP, it can take a long time. Bitcoin wants to change the world forever - not in the next 6, 12, or 18 months. 

4. I agree r/bitcoin is way too censored. Even though I think BCH is a poorly thought out solution to the scaling problem and Bitcoin is way better positioned to fix the scaling problem (therefore I'm a huge bitcoin supporter), you can still have plenty of discussion about fees over there.

This is not really true. If you'll have a look at the github repo for bitcoin you'll see that the devs are working hard even through christmas, and that one of the biggest things they are working to have in the upcoming 0.16.0 release is built-in SegWit address creation in the Core client, SegWit being the thing that has been promised (and included a long time ago, but not with a Graphic User Interface in the core client). I know SegWit is controversial for many people, but it doesn't really change anything except the structure of the transaction, and interestingly increases the block size, although in a bit of a different way compared to a hard fork.

Here is a link for the included issues that will make up the 0.16.0 release, along with the current development status:

"It's a very interesting post that [one by Peter Todd](https://web.archive.org/web/20140511085627/https://bitcoinfoundation.org/forum/index.php?/topic/483-bitcoin-dark-wallet/page__st__20#entry5410).  I want to give my two cents. 


>He's right, but the way he's right is not at all the way you probably think he's right: Bitcoin mining can and almost certainly will be regulated, and by regulating mining you regulate all use of the Bitcoin protocol.

>The first problem is ASICs, specifically the huge gulf in performance per unit cost between commodity hardware, or even hardware possible to create on a small scale with FPGAs, and ASICs. The nature of IC manufacturing is such that a very small number of companies, about two to three, can afford the immense capital costs required to operate top-of-the-line chip fabrication facilities. Put another way, the entire world's economy is unable to support a diverse IC manufacturing industry at the current level of technological sophistication.

And this why many people say that one of Bitcoin's mistakes was either it's choice of algorithm for mining or proof of work altogether. The problem is that when proof of work first became alive nobody knew if it was going to work either. In code yes, in human beings: only time can tell. And so there are lots of alternative now, I especially like Proof of Stake. However there is no simple way of telling if they can work like how proof of work has done it's job for the last 8 - 9 years. And maybe proof of work only works for like 20 years or so. How would we know? This is what makes crypto so bloody mysterious and interesting. We are all blind man trying to get a hold of a future that can't be seen or tasted yet ... and this is what ironically makes me the same as even the richest miner. His power can end really quickly and I don't have any. And we both don't know shit. 






>Control those chip fabs and you control mining. It would be extremely easy for the US government to tell Intel and TSMC that from now on any wafers they process capable of doing Bitcoin mining must include additional circuits that let the US government control how, and by whom, they are used. This is a problem in general with computing, but controlling the manufacture of a special-purpose ASIC is far easier and simpler, both technologically and politically, than controlling the availability of general purpose computing hardware. Fortunately it is possible to create proof-of-work algorithms where custom ASICs have less of an advantage over general purpose hardware, but Bitcoin itself isn't going to change the algorithm.


My two cents here is that it's way easier for any goverment to attack the weakest links, those will always be human beings rather then going after the hardware manufacterrs. The first you can do kind of covert and all the tools are known to work very well. Disinformation, propaganda, censorship, etc etc.  Crypto just is not posing a threat yet for any government to drop paratroopers at chip manufacturers. And we still don't know who Satoshi is. It might be a goverment that saw crypto as something inevitable to come and wanted to make sure that they would be in a position to swap old power for new power. Satoshi otherwise is one hell of damned discipline/principled person not having moved a single coin. 


>The second problem is bandwidth: the Bitcoin protocol has atrocious scalability in that to mine blocks you must keep up with the bandwidth used by all transactions. The current 1MB blocksize is small enough to make this not a major problem yet, but if you increase that (with a hardfork!) at some point you will have increased it to the level where you can no longer mine anonymously and then regulating miners directly becomes possible. Unfortunately while technological improvements have made non-anonymous bandwidth more plentiful, for anonymous bandwidth - or even just censorship resistant bandwidth - the options are much more limited. Jurisdiction hopping is an option, but even for the likes of The Pirate Bay it's proved to be a huge pain in the ass, and they only had the relatively small media industry as their enemy rather than the much larger banking industry. (and government in general) It does appear that you could make a crypto-currency with better core scalability - as opposed to the well understood and already-used ways to fairly securely transfer funds off-chain - but no-one's quite yet figured out yet how to upgrade Bitcoin itself with those improvements.


I do think that this might eventually become a problem but not right now. Just look at the massive amount of bandwith that filesharing and pornography is responsible for. However having the banking industry as your enemy is not something fun. Those have the power to take out whole countries!  But even they can't take down the entire internet, they are to much depended on that internet already. If p2p filesharing can find a away. If Chinese people are able to find a way around the Great Chinese Firewall then crypto will find a way to. However it does give an advantage to miners with better access to bandwith. Ironically most miners are in china where bandwith is way lower then in the west, precisely because of this Great Chinese Firewall.  But Bitcoin can work any network! If enough money is at stake what is to stop a mining company from using something like Satellite internet? High latency but the bandwith both in up and download can be quite high especially if you have an entire satellite for yourself. So all though it's very possible that the banking industry would put pressure on internet provides to block bitcoin traffic ... it's would be a very very tough fight. It's way easier again to again the people. To prevent good community building, to prevent crypto from becoming a money in the first place. All these super grand scheme attacks are not something to be worried about now. They all depend on a future where crypto goes global as a form of money. That does not happen automatically and nobody know if it's going to happen. Changing the mindset of what people believe is money and what is good money and what is better money ... that's the battle that first need to be fought. 


I think that the most viable way for crypto to succeed is to find a way to co-exist with the current fiat system. To offer something to goverment and citizens that can be an addition to the fiat system without being to much a threat.

That's why it needs to become the money of the internet first ... long before it tries to become the money of internet.

The money of the internet is a threat to paypal and visa but the internet of money is a threat to the entire current fiat system and the people that have the power there.  

**Conclusion: Crypto needs to go covert and infiltrate banking and the current fiat system or at least offer something to them so they want to partner up without seeing it as threat or takeover. How: I have no clue. But the powers that are won't allow a threat to grow and become a bigger threat. So the only way is for crypto to be an invisible threat that they don't see as one.**  If the current fiat system has pilars where crypto can take over those pilars ... so that some of the support of the fiat system will be carried by crypto. Then the fiat system can't destroy crypto without crippling itself. Similar to the internet. No power can take it down without becoming seriously crippled themselves. 

So the REAL REAL QUESTION IS: How does crypto become so important so that the powers that are become to depended on it to take it down? Can crypto tempt the bankers for them to become even  more rich? Can crypto offer the least powerful bankers a future where they become the most powerful bankers? There must be something!!!!

Also, Monero already had an aggressive spam attack in 2014, which was used to also exploit a treehash bug, and we had to raise fees as a result. The current fee algorithm is based on those learnings.

">Here's a core dev sticking it to fluffy for being an asshole about on-chain scaling 

Sticking it? He just said bulletproof will reduce transaction size, and proceed to agree with fluffy in his next sentence. You can see how fluffy even +1000'd his comments. By the way, smooth is one of the people who says there is nothing wrong with current fees. He already name called me several times and believes people are paying high fees to skew the average transaction fee. Lol.

> but here's a second one where you didn't

that's not a developer. I didn't say the entire community was ok with the unnecessary high fees, though most of the community and most of the developers are

> another dev categorically rejects all the bullshit that's going on with Bitcoin Core

ok, that's a developer standing against bitcoin core, it was good to read that

Like you and I already said, I think the major breakpoint will come with the bulletproof fork. It will reduce transaction size for single output transactions by 82%. Therefore, the fee should be reduced by 82%. There are only 3 outcomes to this: developers keep the fee per byte, and the fee drops 82%, developers increase the fee per byte decreasing bulletproofs benefits, developers decrease the fee per byte, improving even further the transaction fee decrease by bulletproof. this would naturally be the best outcome as even with bulletproof we will still have expensive transaction.

Cost is one very important aspect of moneyness. I'd very much like to see monero triumph with a perfect fungibility and $10+ transaction fee. Sorry, no way in hell that will happen. I'll not be expecting 2 and half years of stalling and lies like blockstream did to bitcoin core. I will fork monero myself if it comes to that, and I will not care if nobody follows it and is priced at $0.0001, at least I will have done my part. An year has already passed. Time is of the essence in crypto. Monero is not an PnD altcoin and I truly believe it's got to make a dent in mankind. It is what bitcoin was supposed to be, and is turning into what bitcoin core has become.

Before bulletproof appeared in november, all the developers I talked to expressed no concern with the growing fee. I am very much concerned that if BP didn't come out they would still be very finely holding the same thought.

Right because that's going to be super easy! Good thing people who do this kind of thing always leave easy breadcrumbs to follow! I'm so glad you showed me the error of my ways. Its not like its possible to have, idk private chat groups like Dragon's den or anything to coordinate such behavior. Thank god for you Monero geniuses!!

>Gaslighting? Do you even know what that word means?

Yes I do, and yes, that is what it means. 

>Gaslighting is a form of manipulation that seeks to sow seeds of doubt in a targeted individual or in members of a targeted group, hoping to make them question their own memory, perception, and sanity. **Using persistent denial, misdirection, contradiction, and lying**, it attempts to destabilize the target and **delegitimize the target's belief.**

Your entire previous post is a noble attempt at it. 

>And in that vain, it's best that I stop responding.

"> Well, it's christmas and I find you as the interested party wanting me to dig these for you a little bit lazy, with all due respect

I don't see how you can call me lazy ""with all due respect""; but I'm difficult to offend anyways, so let's carry on.

> You can easily in <4 minutes find a lot of info lurking my posts.

No, no I couldn't, but now I realise exactly why: because you say some of the same thigns you've posted here (thanks for that BTW).

And I didn't downvote you. Please check your paranoia at the door.

Here's my issue with your **certainty about an imminent fork away from mainstream monero**: you've spent a lot of time describing how toxic Spagni is. The funny part is that I'm [the biggest critic of Spagni](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7k94q6/the_lead_developer_of_monero_wont_answer_my/drcor6l/?context=3) (and I [won't make you look through my history to corroborate it](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7k0468/fyi_many_altcoin_subreddits_are_also_heavily/draojfl/?context=3)), and I don't agree with your conclusion. 

I'm not seeing at all how the other devs are [on onboard with a permanent fixed high fees situation](https://getmonero.org/2017/12/11/A-note-on-fees.html), at least not all of them. And this makes your whole other hypothesis regarding the desire to scale ""using mainly L2"" crumble. [Here's a core dev sticking it to fluffy for being an asshole about on-chain scaling](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/7dnfdh/what_are_the_current_plans_for_longterm_scaling/dpzk2z0/?context=3) (a discussion you yourself participated in, [but here's a second one where you didn't](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/7k704x/bitcoin_lightning_network_explained_does_this/drcii2m/?context=3)), and one you might have missed where [another dev categorically rejects all the bullshit that's going on with Bitcoin Core](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/74slqm/xmr_scaling_debate_s/do10g8w/?context=3).

So I understand your concerns, and on a hypothetical level I share them, but I've seen no evidence to reach the conclusion that you have. So that you treat the subject as a done deal is quite jarring to people like me, who actually keep a feeler out constantly in the Monero community.

/u/fluffyponyza is not the owner of Monero, he isn't a god. If he decides to go full retard and pull a Maxwell/Dashjr, I fully expect the rest of the devs will stop him with whatever means necessary. But you're right in one thing: the proof will be in the pudding, and what fee calculation algorithm ends up being chosen after the bullet rangeproofs are implemented will be a good signal for the health of the project.

It absolutely does. Unless you're able to connect this behaviour with the dev team (or their condoning of it), I don't know what you expect of anything. This is some next level of insanity. This is like judging football teams' gaming dexterity for the vandalism their hooligan fans cause during the games.

Wait, how is it 'idiotic' to blame your community when two members of it participated in this event? And its not like its a one-off, the Monero community has had no problem with shady tactics like this before and since that incident.
Lying about DNM adoption, lying about monero's privacy (claiming its the #1 privacy coin when its the only coin to have its privacy broken for 80% of its existence), etc. So pointing that out, and showing how its been ongoing since basically the start of your community is a very pertinent thing to do.

Well, this is a good outcome, I suppose. With bulletproofs the fee should come down 82%, leaving as it is. Naturally, I believe cutting it even further would be better, even if just a little bit, but I was really worried on the opposite happening (fee per byte increasing). None of them happening, and Monero benefiting from bulletproofs alone would be good already.

I really want monero to succeed, and what happened to bitcoin is in my opinion traumatic. I will wait and see how things roll, helping as/if I can in any way besides donating. I will leave this scaling/fee debate alone until the fork.

"Stop this dumbass wars. Bitcoin is bitcoin. It's the first, the biggest and mostly the entry point for all other cryptocurrencies. It's the only one that had to deal with massive scaling. The rest are just punkass newbs next to it.
But there were some decisions that were not best for its functionality. Bitcoin is a slow mammoth, it doesn't do things fast, but its making sure to do them right. 
Bitcoin cash made changes that were rash and superficial, but they work. For now. They will not work in the future. But they do work now. Bitcoin cash is way more usable now. Long term, probably it will lose a point to its existence. On top of that, bitcoin cash has the bitcoin name. Without it, it's nothing. It would fail, it wouldnt even get of the ground, because we already have many cryptocurrencies that are technologically superior and have existed for a longer time.
So whatever, use bitcoin cash, it works well in this moment of time, but don't bullshit yourself it's got some special power to take on a behemoth like bitcoin. It just has the name.

Suppose for the sake of argument this dogma is true. Does it make more sense to cripple BTC while searching for a Visa scaling solution or does it make more sense to fix BTC's current problems with the quick blockscaling fix and then search for a better solution with the time that buys. [Here's a great analogy](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7m26vv/the_pirate_bay_gets_it/drr5ta9/) by u/ChadMcChadiusDuChad posting on r/Bitcoin.

> Doesn't matter if its fine for now, it doesn't even have the fraction of TX of Bitcoin...Bcash will have the same mempool problem if it ever reach some adoption.

Demonstrably untrue with math. With 1 MB blocks BTC can support 7 TPS on its finest day. With BCH's 8MB blocks it can support 8x that. So it will take 8 times the amount of transactions that BTC is currently seeing before BCH hits its ceiling, and the code allows scaling to 32MB blocks without a hardfork, so BCH can do 32x the number of transactions that BTC can do.";7;1;False;Zectro;drrptaa;BTC is treating BCH the same way financial institutions used to treat BTC;7m3sqf;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7m3sqf/btc_is_treating_bch_the_same_way_financial/

"I've been following this issue enough to see that Bitcoin has fallen away from its original design, and that is not something that builds confidence. I am not a fan of any fork activity beyond crucial security and maintenance of a standard or development on a predesignated blueprint. These things have happened and now we get to evaluate the aftermath. 

I think there are several types of criticisms about centralization that should be considered:

• One is the premise that Bitcoin Core is somehow more legitimate than Bitcoin Cash.

• Another supposes that Bitcoin Cash development is bad because it is alleged to be a centralized or insulated effort.

• A third would be that Bitcoin Core or Bitcoin Cash are gaming the system to create advantages that certain users or types of users will prosper from at the expense of others.

To the first point, I do not accept that Bitcoin Core is more legitimate than Bitcoin Cash. There are several actions by the Bitcoin Core development that warranted branching away.

While speed of transaction verification is an issue, it is not an issue that I believe warrants any sort of modification to the client. One should be permitted to submit transactions without any fees whatsoever as long as they recognize that they will not have priority and may take longer. This is not a problem that should be solved by modifying the client. It is however a problem that can be solved by participating in an exchange.

The second issue folds back into the first issue, as you are not obliged to patronize any one fork over another. If anything, I hold a higher opinion of people who demonstrate a sense of stewardship in maintaining the integrity of their coin/branch. You ought to provide evidence to support your concerns.

To the third issue I invite everyone to present their concerns about changes that demonstrate bias.

I do in fact have concerns about Bitcoin Cash deviating from the design, but I have more concerns with Bitcoin Core doing the same. The lesser of two evils at the moment is Bitcoin Cash, IMO. My opinion can certainly change.";4;0;False;PeppermintPig;drroefh;BTC is treating BCH the same way financial institutions used to treat BTC;7m3sqf;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7m3sqf/btc_is_treating_bch_the_same_way_financial/
