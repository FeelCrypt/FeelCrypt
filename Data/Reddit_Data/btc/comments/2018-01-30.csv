To help foster a full transparency approach on the editing of this section, I am sending the revised section to you for further comment.

 

8.1.2      Bitcoin Cash (BCH)

In 2017, Bitcoin users adopted an improvement proposal for Segregated Witness (known as SegWit, where transactions are split into two segments: transactional data, and signature data) through a soft fork. SegWit made it possible to store transactional data in a more compact form while maintaining backwards compatibility.  However, a group of users had different opinions on how Bitcoin should evolve – and developed a hard fork of the Bitcoin blockchain titled Bitcoin Cash. Rather than implementing the SegWit changes, the developers of Bitcoin Cash decided to simply increase the blocksize. When the hard fork occurred, people had access to the same amount of coins on Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash.";5;0;False;mynt;dtg0mjo;"/r/bitcoin is censoring the NIST report that says ""Bitcoin Cash is the original blockchain"" and Bitcoin Core is not.

"Very interesting questions. For the first, I think that SW is a good idea and is a necessary first step for the Lightening Network. Larger blocks sizes do work (as in BCH) for the time being however I believe that they are not a long term solution otherwise there would be no objections to implementing them. The problem with scaling is that as soon as you ramp up adoption of BCH to that of BTC you will soon have the same issues as Bitcoin. Bch is a near empty highway at the moment. That is an unvarnished truth. The LN is not an instant fix, frustrating as that is, but the community is prepared to wait for a better solution.

As for Coinbase ""bullying""...  That is an interesting phrase in the light of Coinbase 's behaviour. Bitcoin is still the largest single crypto market (although dropping) and SW is not technically difficult to implement - plenty of exchanges and wallets have done so as a matter of course. It seems passing strange that Coinbase has ignored its biggest and most profitable market to accommodate a cryptocurrency that is fourth down the line. Naturally Bitcoin owners are lobbying Coinbase to ramp up SW adoption or they will take their money to an exchange that will. Bitcoin owners are not completely stupid.

I see the BCH community lobbying everyone and their dog to accommodate their crypto or use it as trading pairs. I don't see this as ""bullying"". I see it as an excellent community response in promoting their brand. Few do this better then BCH.  Being assertive is not bullying.

I could go on, but I suspect that you already know the basic arguments on both sides. My personal opinion is that there is room for both coins and eventually neither coin will end up dominating in the future. No doubt something else will be superior to the Bitcoin code so these little battles will appear quaint to the historians of crypto one day.

"rbitcoin is not bitcoin but money is a social network of acceptance that you need to trust will exist in the future. 

Further, people follow trust in people and look for leaders. Therefore the fixation of core supporters (see? I can generalize too) on Ver thinking that bitcoin cash = Ver  and thinking that attacking Ver's image will have any impact.

Further, theymos (whoever that is) controls multiple channels that were the standard channels for the community years back with rbitcoin being only one. That has an impact. Similarly, it is also why core trolls love to attack @bitcoin twitter.
 
rbitcoin is not rtheymos, not some ""random dude's private forum"" that bitcoiners just happened to fancy as much as r/casualchat. 

rbitcoin is tricking the community and the general public into thinking that the bitcoin that they have gotten to know for the past 9 years is the 1mb-forever segwit branch. 3 years back Bitcoin was going to take over the World, that's what people got to hear that bitcoin was. Now its going to take over some ETFs?

"Listen man.  I don't want to be rude, but you're still missing it.  None of the forks you've been listing are hard forks.  Again, ask yourself, what consensus rule did they break?  If the answer is ""none"", then it's a soft fork.

> The block 3 version upgrade made the OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY op code valid. So prior to the fork, transactions with that op code were not valid and after it they are. 

That opcode wasn't created.  It was re-purposed.  Before CLTV was activated, that opcode was available, but it was meaningless.  [It was previously called OP_NOP2](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script#Locktime)

Again, when CLTV activated, it didn't break any previous consensus rule, it only made a new rule.  Non-upgraded nodes would process the opcode, but not be able to enforce it, meaning it wouldn't choke on it.  Hard forks break rules, soft forks just add new rules while being backwards compatible.

CLTV, just like the block versioning scheme, didn't break any existing rules.

You keep listing soft forks, claiming they are hard forks.  Bitcoin Cash was a hard fork because it broke the rule that said blocks must be under 1mb.  None of these forks you have listed broke an existing rule.  I apologize if I'm not explaining it properly, but I don't know how else to explain it.

"> Changing the block size and the difficulty adjustment also changed these rules but were also backwards compatible (like Segwit) with the original chain otherwise people who had bitcoins before the August 1st would no longer have their bitcoins on the new chain.

A soft fork restricts the definition of what is a ""valid block"" under consensus rules. Thus, any block that is valid under the new consensus rules was also valid under the old rules, so an unupgraded client can validate those blocks with no issue. Now, an upgraded client wouldn't want to mine, because they may form a block that didn't fit the restricted definition of validity of the new rules that it isn't aware of, but it can still valdiate and forward blocks, and run a node. In the case of Segwit, it uses some clever tricks to remain compatible with the old consensus rules, including repurposing an opcode, moving data, and putting the signature merkle root in the coinbase transation, which had previously un-purposed space. 

A hard fork is an upgrade that expands the definition of a valid block so that the new rules allow some kind of block that wasn't allowed under the old rules. In the case of BCH, that meant both including blocks up to 8mb, which would not have been valid before the fork, and including blocks with a much lower difficulty under certain conditions, which also would not have been accepted before the fork.

So, old client running unupgraded software stayed on the Bitcoin chain, while Bitcoin Cash forked off. It has nothing to do with the transaction histories, that is maintained in any case. 

Terms like these are very well defined in the Bitcoin space and it is helpful to understand their definition before engaging in a discussion about the technology.

"LOL the title of the section in question is just ""8.1.2 Bitcoin Cash (BCC).""

I don't have a problem with that.

How is this nit picking? Segwit being a hard fork is very much wrong. Bitcoin Cash is an incompatible fork of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is backwards compatible with the pre-Segwit Bitcoin. Someone running an unpgraded client before either fork would still be on Bitcoin today. That is the truth, and it was the opposite of what was presented in the NIST paragraph. 

I'm not on any side here, I just want people to have accurate information so they can form their own opinions.

That is NOT CENSORSHIP and saying it is in this post just makes me believe that the rest of this subreddit's claims of censorship in r/bitcoin are bullshit too.

You may want to reread AA's book as you are failing to understand my point that the BCH blockchain is backward's compatible with all blocks and transactions on the main chain prior to the August 1st fork.  Can someone running v0.9 Core software view transactions and blocks on the BCH chain after Block 478558, of course not.

Segwit is hard fork masquerading as a soft fork.  At least, BCH is an opt-in upgrade to the to Bitcoin.  Users have a choice to upgrade their software or not.  With the Segwit fork, users only choice is to opt-out of the segwit chain or eventually upgrade their software to be able to handle segwit transactions.  Try sending a bc1 (bech32 P2WPKH) Segwit transaction to an older v0.8 or v0.9 client wallet.  It cannot accept the transaction.  So if these and other segwit transactions become the norm, users will be forced to upgrade their clients (doesn't that sound like a hard fork?) when doing business with counter-parties using segwit addresses.

"I'm certain I know what I'm talking about, and I've explained it pretty well.  It's not rocket science.

Segwit didn't break any Bitcoin consensus rules.  It remains fully compatible.  A node from pre-August 2017 will sync up and follow the segwit chain with no issues.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin Cash broke two consensus rules, the blocksize limit, and the difficulty adjustment algorithm.  For these reasons, pre-August 2017 nodes will never follow the Bitcoin Cash chain.  It's incompatible.  You have to download a Bitcoin Cash client that has those changes incorporated.

You can prove this to yourself by loading up an old version of Bitcoin.  Here is a link to the [Bitcoin client from October 2015](https://bitcoin.org/bin/bitcoin-core-0.11.1/).  This was years before segwit was coded, and years before the Bitcoin Cash fork.  Load it up and let it sync.  When it's done syncing, get the block height.  You'll see that it synced up perfectly with the segwit enabled bitcoin blockchain.  That's because segwit is the original chain.

I read somewhere dodo's were Delicious.   Instead of cloning humans we need to clone dodo's.;2;1;False;business2690;dthabpb;U.S. Regulators to Subpoena Crypto Exchange Bitfinex, Tether;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-30/crypto-exchange-bitfinex-tether-said-to-get-subpoenaed-by-cftc
Dodos had an unusual diet involving stones. Dodo birds’ diet included seeds, nuts, bulbs, roots, and fallen fruit. In addition, they would also feed on palm fruit, shell fish and crabs. This is a very similar diet to the modern crowned pigeon. Dodo birds used gizzard stones to aid their digestion.One of the more interesting dodo bird facts is that these birds lived in almost complete isolation. Scientists discovered that the dodo only ever lived on the island of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean. They were so isolated that their population didn’t even spread to the neighboring islands off the eastern coast of Africa. The simple reason for this is that the dodo was flightless and was therefore unable to reach any other island or land mass.One of the more intriguing dodo bird facts involves just how they became extinct. They lived on the island of Mauritius where there was an abundance of food and almost no predators. What, then, caused their extinction? In a word: people. Dodos were unfortunately not frightened of people, which made them very easy prey for human hunters. Sailors who arrived on the island of Mauritius from the year 1598 started hunting dodos, and initiated mass killings, to the point where these birds were extinct by 1681. Although people believed the dodo to be stupid because it readily approached men who were armed with clubs, these birds had no natural enemies and so had no experience with predators. They were simply curious, not stupid.In addition to being killed by people, the dodo was also affected by exposure to new animals. The sailors who arrived on Mauritius introduced new species to the island. They brought with them their domesticated animals, which preyed on the dodos, ate their eggs, and destroyed their natural habitat, leading to their extinction. These animals included dogs, pigs, cats and rats. Due to their isolation, the dodo birds simply had no natural defenses and became extinct only 175 years after they were discovered.Unlike most other birds that build their nests in trees, dodos used to build their nests on the ground. This was largely because they couldn’t fly, and their nests didn’t need to be protected in trees because the dodo had no natural predators on Mauritius.There are many mysteries surrounding various dodo bird facts, including the fact that they were flightless birds. However, scientists believe that they do now have some of the answers. One of the reasons that the dodo became flightless was probably because there were virtually no potential predators in its natural habitat on the island of Mauritius. In addition, there was an abundance of food for these birds, so they really had no reason to fly. This is what is known as secondary flightlessness. The adaptation for flight is only maintained when it is absolutely necessary, because it requires such a great expenditure of energy for a bird. This was simply not required in the Mauritian environment, and so the adaptation was lost.Don’t let the rather strange appearance of the dodo fool you. One of the more bizarre dodo bird facts is that these birds could actually run quite fast. Although there is a lack of scientific evidence from the time when dodos were alive, modern scientists have managed to deduce this fact based on the dodo bird’s skeletal structure and the size of its legs.The dodo was alive before the invention of the camera so for a long time, it was hard for us to know exactly what this bird looked like. To complicate matters, very few skeletal remains were found. Therefore, for centuries our understanding of the appearance of dodos was based on anecdotal evidence and amateur sketches. It was only in 2007 that a complete skeleton of a dodo bird was found, which could confirm many of the dodo bird facts. However, exact facts about the dodo’s plumage, girth and coloring are still in question.Although there is some anecdotal evidence and a few skeletons to furnish us with many dodo bird facts, there are some things that have never been reported. There is no information whatsoever about the dodo’s mating habits, behaviors, or life expectancy. In that regard, the life cycle of a dodo seems deemed to remain an intriguing mystery forever.Scientists and the general population during the Victorian era were intrigued by newly emerging dodo bird facts. Lewis Carroll, the famous author, included these quirky birds in his children’s classic Alice in Wonderland. Contrary to popular characterizations, the dodos in this book are depicted as being quite solemn and wise.The fact that the dodo bird is immortalized in the saying As dead as a dodo is a telling dodo bird fact that is relevant to all environmentalists today. The saying refers to all traces of something being completed wiped out, just as the dodo was on the island of Mauritius. This bird has come to represent conservationism and movements against eco-terrorism. The utter destruction of this interesting creature was entirely due to the direct and indirect causes introduced by people, who then failed to intervene and preserve this unique species.If you are lucky enough to visit the island of Mauritius, you will see dodos everywhere. Not live ones, of course, but replicas and images wherever you look. A little-known dodo bird fact is the extent to which these birds are present in Mauritius’ tourism industry. The image of the dodo has been transformed into just about every possible version that could pass as a tempting curio for the tourists visiting this island paradise. So, in addition to sugar and rum, the dodo is a significant contributor to the Mauritian tourism economy.Subfossil remains show the dodo was about 1 metre (3 ft 3 in) tall and may have weighed 10.6–17.5 kg (23–39 lb) in the wild. The dodo's appearance in life is evidenced only by drawings, paintings, and written accounts from the 17th century.Dodos did not have any natural predators.;28;7;False;AnimalFactsBot;dth8hlt;U.S. Regulators to Subpoena Crypto Exchange Bitfinex, Tether;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-30/crypto-exchange-bitfinex-tether-said-to-get-subpoenaed-by-cftc

As the likelihood of a complete Tether shutdown increases, the confidence should decrease and we should see the price of Tether drop.  If the market were rational, alts would be increasing in value as people flee from Tether into them.;31;9;False;Dabauhs;dth6uig;U.S. Regulators to Subpoena Crypto Exchange Bitfinex, Tether;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-30/crypto-exchange-bitfinex-tether-said-to-get-subpoenaed-by-cftc
"I see this as a win-win situation in the long run. Either Tether is backed and confidence is restored or Tether is found to be hoax and it will be taken down and clear the path for legitimate trading pairs.

I've been [temporarily] using Tether on some exchanges to trade some of the obscure scammy bitcoin forks like ""Super Bitcoin"" (SBTC) into BCH. There is no trading pair for those two coins, you must go from SBTC to Tether, and then from Tether to BCH.

Why not go from SBTC directly to BTC you ask? Because I'm only trading 1 or 2 of these sh*tcoins at a time, and they're worth only ~ $50, so I'd get only 0.01 BTC or something.
