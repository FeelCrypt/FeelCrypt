"Bringing up a dead cat bounce for a scam coin has zero relevance to anything here at all. Youre reaching  to make a point. I dont even think you know what a dead cat bounce is, actually. If BTC had a dead cat bounce - i would want to be out of it when the stop loss was reached. The whole point of whaf constitues a dead cat bounce is that dumbasses don't realize the asset is going to die.

And no i have zero fear that bitcoin could hit 1000 on a real exchange with sufficient volume. Bitcoin, not some small cap altcoin like bcash. Again, gemini is a legal trust. If their trading engine fucked up they are actually legally liable. 

You do not seem to realize that what happened here was a 999 limit order, nothing to do with a stop loss. I get it, i called someone a noob, so you want to do a ""no u"" - but you come off silly to anyone that understands the topic.";0;1;False;;dvxs13d;Some poor bastard just sold their BTC for $999 instead of $9999.;859rmi;https://i.redd.it/otfdqez8ygm01.jpg

"OK, your right. So keep all of your BTC on an exchange with a stop loss of $999. Seems safe and smart for a scenario that even according to you probably won't happen. 
Bitconnect bounced from $15 to $70, over 300% bounce
ZCL did over 150%
And if there really was a reason for BTC to crash to 0, do you really think your order would be filled? If BTC goes to 0 guess what, nobody is buying it.
