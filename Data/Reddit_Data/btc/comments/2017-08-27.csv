and for bidir chan (you can both spend money, and as well earn money, all without touching the chain at all) limit is either also infinite, or:  number of times the direction changes must be <= blocks in the set channel lifetime, e.g.: around 3000 direction changes (so e.g. 3000 txes in worst case) for 30 day long channel.";1;2;False;metalzip;dm6avug;No Neo I'm trying to tell you ...;6w60ij;https://i.redd.it/iiwc9y3ok3iz.jpg

Hashcash was not even invented by Adam Back, but two academic researchers Dwork and Naor. Adam just created an implementation of it about 5 years later to use with email that ultimately went nowhere, so his claims to have ""invented"" hashcash are 100% a lie too. Bitcoin was unleashed about 12 years after Adam's version of Hashcash.
