"The B in BCH stands for Bitcoin just like the B in BTC stands for Bitcoin. Satoshi came up with a system where scaling would not be an issue as long as the law of moore would keep up when it comes to disk storage and as long as the price of bandwith keeps going down. 

He wrote under point 7 ""Reclaiming Disk Space"" in his white paper called ""A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System""

>Once the latest transaction in a coin is buried under enough blocks, the spent transactions before it can be discarded to save disk space. To facilitate this without breaking the block's hash, transactions are hashed in a Merkle Tree [7][2][5], with only the root included in the block's hash. Old blocks can then be compacted by stubbing off branches of the tree. The interior hashes do not need to be stored.


>A block header with no transactions would be about 80 bytes. If we suppose blocks are generated every 10 minutes, 80 bytes * 6 * 24 * 365 = 4.2MB per year. With computer systems typically selling with 2GB of RAM as of 2008, and Moore's Law predicting current growth of 1.2GB per year, storage should not be a problem even if the block headers must be kept in memory.

So that covers disk space.  Bitcoin can grow without outgrowing the growth in disk space. 

Then bandwith. Satoshi writes: 

>
The bandwidth might not be as prohibitive as you think. A typical transaction would be about 400 bytes (ECC is nicely compact). Each transaction has to be 
broadcast twice, so lets say 1KB per transaction. Visa processed 37 billion transactions in FY2008, or an average of 100 million transactions per day. 
That many transactions would take 100GB of bandwidth, or the size of 12 DVD or 2 HD quality movies, or about $18 worth of bandwidth at current prices.

>If the network were to get that big, it would take several years, and by then, 
sending 2 HD movies over the Internet would probably not seem like a big deal. 


So Satoshi designed a system that looked at disk storage and bandwidth and those would never cause a problem in scaling, otherwise he would have designed the system differently.

"HOOOOOOOLLLY COW.

I was about to say, isn't this the exact problem that the Blockchain itself was implemented to deal with? We can't trust people to accurately record the state of their own wallet (as attached to their private key, you can obviously mess around with the wallet as much as you like if the key isn't compromised) so we distribute the state to the whole network. ""Address 123 has 3 btc"" as confirmed by every full node in the network.

In 'first layer' Bitcoin, if someone sends an invalid transaction it gets rejected by the consensus. The only way to overcome the consensus is to carry out a 51% attack (i.e. *become* the consensus). Spamming won't work if the network is robust enough.

Lightning Network adds in a penalty to those who attempt invalid transactions *in place of the PoW requirement* and likewise does not have a ledger to reference. It is vulnerable to a spam attack so it needs some method of enforcement, hence the penalty.

Which means it has no practical way (at this point) of identifying a 'true' attackers vs. someone who, as here, is just using an out-of-date version of their channel state or, perhaps, states that were corrupted by someone other than the user, intentionally, since they can't check a tamper-proof ledger to recall the state.

So basically they get Type I errors (false positives) and apply the penalty to innocent parties.

Which is REALLLLLLLLLY BAD IF YOU WANT PEOPLE TO ENTRUST THE SYSTEM WITH LARGE AMOUNTS OF CURRENCY.

It'd be a bit like if your Bank dinged you $500 every time an *apparently* fraudulent transaction appeared on your account, whether it was actually fraudulent or not. Oh, and had an absolute policy against reversing said charge.

*****

I may have misunderstood something, but either way it starts to confirm my long-held suspicions that the LN is an increasingly complex solution that is going to create a lot of additional problems before it is perfected (if ever).

And the unwillingness to raise the block limit in the meantime is going to look more and more unreasonable. ";34;3;False;Faceh;dwbfxah;Comedy gold over at r/bitcoin;https://i.imgur.com/btTEoOA.png

I think most would agree (even core guys) that bitcoin's block size should be adaptable (via algorithmus or via soft fork). As far as I get it the fixed max block size came originally from some temporary anti-spam measure; the only way to get rid off it was then a hard-fork, which many opposed against. BCH has done the hard-fork already, BTC will do it sooneror later, too.

"> First: There's more than 10 times the transactions on BTC chain than BCH chain. Transaction volume has gone down on both, so I don't see it being directly related to high fees.

At the moment, the blocks aren't full -- and when blocks aren't full the limit is irrelevant.  However, you only need look back to the time (scant months ago) when blocks _were_ full to see that it was a serious problem.  And it is that time that has scared off merchants.  Bitcoin was booming, had huge media presence and yet they couldn't take orders or their new-Bitcoin-using customers were being asked for large percentage fees for small item purchases.  Do you not accept that that will have had an effect on adoption?

> And making more effective use of the block space you have is a far more important task to work on.

We'll have to agree to disagree then, because my feeling is that Bitcoin is getting slowly strangled by prioritising technical navel gazing over user adoption.  If you've ever talked to anyone who's _not_ already one of the enlightened, it's a hard enough sell as it is.  Bitcoin is a dirty word -- the mainstream media mostly hate it and have filled their heads with ""it's only for drug dealers/paedophiles"", ""it's imaginary"", ""it's a scam"", and ""you get arrested for using it"".  The _only_ positive it's got going for it right now (ignoring the gamble of increased value of an investment) is that its transactions are fast and cheap.  When those are not true, exactly what is the selling proposition?  That lightning network will make it good next year, as long as you understand this complicated intermediate layer _and_ Bitcoin?  You'll forgive me if I don't see how to argue for that.

Making more effective use of block space is _absolutely_ a worthwhile goal; but doing that while not simultaneously taking a technically cheap improvement (1MB blocks are embarrassingly small, and the idea that increasing that x10 would be anything other than a negligible cost increase is sophistry) feels awfully like sabotage.  When the average web page is twice the size of the _maximum_ Bitcoin block -- something is very wrong.  You make it sound like the work on LN would have to stop in order for the block limit to be raised.  If BCH only did one thing it's that it demonstrated that raising the limit is possible fairly easily (and what's more, that work is portable back to BTC if it were wanted).";10;1;False;kingofthejaffacakes;dwau8k6;"""We've tested Bitcoin Cash vs Lightning Network and...

"First: There's more than 10 times the transactions on BTC chain than BCH chain. Transaction volume has gone down on both, so I don't see it being directly related to high fees.

The technical limits are not that arbitrary. The *costs* of running a full node should be kept low - because economic activity *should* preferably be backed by independent nodes. Letting the miners do the validation of the TXes themselves, all centralized in fewer and bigger mining pools are a slippery slope to ""paypal 2.0"". Now, if paypal were backed by a blockchain, it'd probably be better than the paypal than we have now, but it'd be *far from* a non-censorable global currency.

Imposing limits now are a good idea, because it *is* already a significant cost to run a  full node. But I agree: I am not *that* fundamental ""small-blocker"". I haven't done the full calculations for what a small block size would mean to the economics, but I also believe that it's better to err on the safe side. And making more effective use of the block space you have is a *far* more important task to work on.

You simply shift that burden to the merchants and let THEM cash out and every person that does that, reduces that blocksize needed in your citations hypothetical scenario.... I don't see the validity of that scenario in your link. That's not how it will work in real life. People will load channels, and leave them loaded. Thos in third world countries that have a couple bucks a week or month, are not going to want to pay anything to get the Bitcoin when they can simply send a LN transaction worth 3 cents to their village store to get their water or food or supplies. The merchants may even be able to use LN with their vendors, keeping THEM from having to pay to switch to BTC.

Also, not saying we don't need to go to maybe 4 or maybe 8 MB blocks someday. But we sure as hell won't need them for YEARS possibly because of Lightning.

"This post is very misleading. 

Do I need to open new payment channels for every new party I want to transact with?

No, the Lightning Network is (thus its name), constructed as a network. Meaning although Alice might not yet have an open payment channel with Dave, Alice is indirectly connected with Dave via Bob, or even using multiple steps in between. With the Lightning Network, users are able to transact with anyone who is connected to their network of payment channels through multiple hops. In theory, everyone should be connected to everyone else through the network via only few nodes. People are also incentivised running these connecting nodes through (small) fees that are paid out every time a transaction uses one of their connections. Early results from the testnet implementation of the Lightning Network confirm that a sufficiently decentralized network indeed can be created.

The architecture of the Lightning network is still trustless (because it is based on smart contracts) and will always make sure that the funds will reach their destination through intermediaries, or issue a refund if there is no indirect path to the destination possible.

LTC or ETH are also trying out lightning network. I wonder why..";19;4;False;kwillnz;dwaiw9r;"""We've tested Bitcoin Cash vs Lightning Network and... LN feels so unnecessary and over-complicated.

"If there's only five people using BTC because it adoption stopped (and momentum is hard to get back for new products) it won't matter that it's capable of serving seven billion people...

Do you not agree that there are practical aspects to getting the world to adopt a new form of money over and above either side's technical arguments?  All those people who were advocates of Bitcoin within merchants now look like idiots, and when they say ""we should implement LN"" will have no social capital to burn precisely because Bitcoin's failure to scale _now_ let them down.

That block sizes can't be increased forever is not an argument that they shouldn't be increased a little bit.  There is a lot of grey between the black and white of 1MB or 10000GB.  And in fact, if you want to avoid creating perverse incentives, it's better that block sizes are allowed to increase with economics as the limiting factor rather than arbitrary centrally-imposed technical limits.

It's the exact analogous situation to that of a central bank deciding interest rates and what the money supply should be -- it's simply not possible for any centralised party to have enough information to know the ""right"" value.  Free-markets are better at managing resource scarcity through the price mechanism.  Capital controls, and supply side limiting _always_ fail relative to simply letting the market find its own level.

In Bitcoin-land that means that you should (in the end) be able to buy more block space for your transaction by increasing the fee.  That's only possible if block sizes aren't limited arbitrarily but are limited by what miners will accept and what they want in exchange.  Further: that only really becomes relevant when we're well into the adoption curve, and we're well into the supply curve -- neither of which have happened yet, so why on Earth would imposing limits now be a good idea?";16;5;False;kingofthejaffacakes;dwasy1l;"""We've tested Bitcoin Cash vs Lightning Network and...
