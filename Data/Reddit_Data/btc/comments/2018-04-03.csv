"> The other forks also eliminate themselves in other ways by changing the PoW, adding pre-mines, not trying to be a currency just a SOV

And I suppose you're going to be the judge of what coins can be considered bitcoin of course? Why not take the simple approach and look at each time a fork happens which of the two ends up being bitcoin? I can tell you why you wont: because that would make it too clear that bcash is not bitcoin, so instead you, as I said, have to make all these mental hoops to get the outcome you like - and the more mental hoops (and now conspiracies lol) you add the more people just laugh at you because it becomes increasingly ridiculous, to the point where it starts to look like a scam. I know you don't see it like this, and thats fine, but whenever you wonder why someone might not like bcash as much as you, this is most likely the reason. You don't have to respond to this, I know *what you opinion is already*.

> or segregating the signatures so it's no longer a blockchain (of signatures).

What a crock of shit. Sorry for my harsh words, but you've been seriously misled if you think bitcoin is no longer a blockchain, or doesnt have a chain of electronic signatures.

> I think it's just you that thinks it's a scam. A bunch of exchanges, merchants, services, users and otherwise do not think it's a scam.

The currency works (like hundreds of other alts), theres no question about it, and thats not what makes it a scam. It becomes a scam when people try to assert that its the real bitcoin. It doesn't matter if you succeed in convincing people of this, but the mere fact that this is whats happening makes it a scam. Kind of like if I wanted to buy gold from you, and you told me that silver was the real gold. Sure, silver is still silver and it has the properties it has, but *selling it as gold* is a scam.";0;1;False;slashfromgunsnroses;dwqprzk;"r/Cryptocurrency usually automatically downvotes any pro-BCH thread into oblivion.

The point of SegShit is to segregate the signatures so after they've been verified by a node they can easily be discarded and no longer take up space on their disk. Right?

OK so tell me if there is 100% adoption of SegShit and all the miners and non-mining nodes remove all their signatures on disk after verifying, how does a new node *securely* bootstrap itself from the network without any signatures to verify?";1;1;False;n9jd34x04l151ho4;dwqu7w9;"r/Cryptocurrency usually automatically downvotes any pro-BCH thread into oblivion.

You've been seriously misinformed. The point of segwit is to 1. fix malleability, 2. increase blocksize, 3. create incentives to spend and consolidate utxo's (and probably a couple of other things I forget).

This is achieved by redefining block structure so witness data can be segregated from tx data in a block, however *all signature data is still there in every block thats mined*.

What you are describing is called pruning. You have *always* been able to run a pruned node (a node can do whatever it wants with its data). Just run bitcoin core with -prune and it strips signature data from blocks (also before segwit). It has nothing to do with making this easier, as this has always been the case. Segwit has nothing to do with removing signatures.";1;0;False;slashfromgunsnroses;dwqwd9w;"r/Cryptocurrency usually automatically downvotes any pro-BCH thread into oblivion.
