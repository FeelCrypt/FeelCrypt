"> All forks of Bitcoin are claiming to be the real Bitcoin.

I don't think thats true, and you can continue to assert bcash is the real Bitcoin, but in the end it still comes back to this: the reason pro-BCH threads are downvoted on r/cryptocurrency, as this thread is about, is because *most people* do not see it this way. Most people don't believe that there are many bitcoin.

> here's 3 or more to choose from now.

Actually there many more: http://list.wiki/Bitcoin_Hard_Forks - of worthy mention is Bitcoin Clashic, which is the true bcash (you didn't kill off the original bcash because of the EDA).

Basically, all these forks had to either change PoW or change the difficulty algo to survive. Thats because all these forks have in common that they simply don't have enough support behind them to have ever had a chance to become bitcoin. At every hard fork event two chains result - one is bitcoin, the other is not. I know you dont feel too good about this, but in the end, what you are saying is that there are X bitcoin chains and Y total bitcoins in circulation. That is completely absurd, and this is what most people recognize, and this is why people see bcash as a scam (when it tries to assert itself as Bitcoin).

The only valid contender to being bitcoin was 2x - its sold itself as an upgrade, and not a different project (bcash even chose another name for itself).

"Anything that would not have attempted to loot or poach the Bitcoin name.  It was a terrible marketing strategy as it instantly created and incentivized ill-will amongst a huge number of crypto users.  Whether you believe the ""but it's more aligned with the original whitepaper"" argument or not, it doesn't matter.  The strategy to steal away the Bitcoin brand instantly created a direct effort to marginalize Bcash.  BCash is not a derogatory description of the Bitcoin Cash name.  Had it been adopted and embraced, and thereby disarmed this stupid narrative, it could have led to this chain's success.  Branding it as BCash would not have created such a large anti user base.   If it had been marketed as BCash and focus was spent on emphasizing the positive aspects of the chain, it would have run into much less resistance.  Later there might have been the potential to be able to adopt the Bitcoin name at a later date.  By the point BCash might have created sufficient user support however, adopting the Bitcoin brand likely would not have been necessary since by that point.   BCash would have been standing on its own merits.  There is no denying tha this project has been driven by Roger Ver and he has been able to drive the projects narrative.  His disdain for supporters of the original Bitcoin chain and some of its developers has blinded him from taking the proper strategy which might have lead to BCash's success.

In december I would agree with you, but with segwit and batching the fees went down to under 10 sat/byte, which I think is a decent fee if you look at the average transaction value. 

>The people using threats, subterfuge, and censorship to proclaim ""1MB4ever!"" have painted themselves into a corner. The have eliminated the ""long tail"" from the system.

This. Its arrogant to think that your opinion is more important than the **majority**. Lets not have the blockdebate again, we had it and bigger blocks lost. I am sorry to point it out, but there is nothing which shows that the majortiy wants bigger blocks. There is less development in BCH, less mining (security) and the price is less than 10% than the real Bitcoin. You guys tried to make a case for it, and you lost it mostly because of your aggressive aproach. 

I tried to tell you guys that most people were not against bigger blocks in the beginning, most were indifferent But the people I personally know just really dislike the approach BCH took, its a maliciousness approach in most peoples mind and people like Roger Ver, fake satoshi and this pedophile from Island are not people I want to follow. They all have a history of being very selfish, egocentric people who have no problem with criminal behavior in their past. 

I am just the messenger here and tell you what a lot of people think, dont hate me for it, I try to stay decent, I am not calling it btrash or bcash because I understand that just triggers people and wont lead to any healthy discussion.

"> This. Its arrogant to think that your opinion is more important than the **majority**. 

I think you missed my point: the **majority** are physically unable to use BTC. There is simply not enough capacity. Fees went down: not because of batching or segwit, but because people are leaving the system in droves.

You're getting off topic.  I never said that the BCash project wasn't a worthwhile investment amongst the people that believe in it.  I never said they were scammers and I never said it couldn't be successful.  I implied that it won't be successful as long as Bcash supporters stick to the narrative that Bcash is Bitcoin.  It's not.  Bitcoin is Bitcoin meaning the chain that includes segwit to fix transaction malleability and uses the development of 2nd layer solutions to solve scalability.  This is accepted by 99.99% of the crypto-community and more so outside of it.  Focusing so much effort on the name has prevented acceptance of BCash from becoming viable.  ;1;1;False;ddbbccoopper;dwonwkj;"r/Cryptocurrency usually automatically downvotes any pro-BCH thread into oblivion.

"You do it again: You make up your own storyline which fits your narrative.

Let me be superclear: The Majority of cryptoinvestors/developers/miners/traders/hodlers/space/industry/regulators choose btc over bch. With your capacity you want to start the blockdebate again, stop it, you lost. 8 mb blocks are not enough to service the whole world and lightning as it is now also not. Both is a solution to get to the next level of adoption, but the Majority of the space has choosen the btc path.
