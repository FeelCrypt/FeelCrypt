"You need to re-read section 4, I think.

>	The majority decision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested in it.

I think that’s pretty clear. 

I think you’re taking things like this in section 5:

>	Nodes always consider the longest chain to be the correct one and will keep working on extending it.

And taking it out of context with the rest of the paper.

Regardless, you’re free to do as you wish, that’s the beauty of cryptocurrency.  No one is going to force you to use BTC. 

The paper doesn’t really cover minority forks, expecting them to resolve as miners converge on the chain with the greatest PoW. I don’t think Satoshi considered the need to state that a minority fork with minority hashrate and different rules isn’t Bitcoin, it’s not exactly an economically rational action in the long term to diverge from the money that everyone else is using if you don’t have direct control over the monetary policy.  Think about that for a while and you might find some possibilities of the reasoning for certain entities to support BCH, just a thought...";2;0;False;Username96957364;dykoubv;"Am I the only one that doesn't mind Bitcoin Cash being called ""Bitcoin Cash"" instead of just ""Bitcoin"" (for now)?";https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8h7l37/am_i_the_only_one_that_doesnt_mind_bitcoin_cash/
"I agree that nothing should be etched in stone. But at the same time you can not reference one part of the WP and then ignore the other when it no longer fits your definition.  So either we can use the WP as ""Gospel"" and use the quote given or we can make up our own definitions. In the case of the later we have to accept that other people will see it differently as there is no longer a text book definition of what is and isn't. That then comes to the realm of what ""feels"" right which as we all know is not scientific. Which is why I choose the middle ground of everything is bitcoin that starts from the genesis block and in my opinion BCH is the ""better"" bitcoin. I disagree when bch supporters say bch is the REAL bitcoin. But at the same time think btc supporters do not have a leg to stand on when they say bch isnt bitcoin. 

If BTC somehow managed to reach ""community consensus"" and fork to 1 min blocks I would wonder what all the bullshit about the size increase was.. but to your point if it then overtook as the longest chain I would say that yes it is indeed the dominant chain. But I would not change my stance that there is more than one flavor of bitcoin. We have different opinions on I think there is a dominant chain and you think there can be only chain called bitcoin. I do not think we can find a compromise there.

"Thank you for the straightforward and explanation of your definition of what you consider to be bitcoin.  Satoshi's "" longest proof-of-work chain"" definition has been somewhat muddled given the start of bch had the mad swings in miner activity giving it the ""longest"" chain while btc maintains the most ""proof of work"". As you said miners will mine whatever makes the most money which is how bitcoin was designed to work. Which in my opinion makes which metric you look at a mater of interpretation. Which is why in my opinion until one coin is able to claim both metrics neither will be the ""dominant"" chain. That being said as long as anyone is mining any fork they are also a version of bitcoin. We will have to just disagree about the definition. There is no longer 1 bitcoin. There is also no longer 1 dominant chain. BTC is unarguably the leader in POW. BCH has the longest chain though I am sure you will disagree with the validity of it. One will eventually claim both. I agree with you that at the end the chain with the most activity will win. I see more potential for that on the BCH chain but only time will tell. Once again I thank you for taking the time to write your clear personal definition.

"Bitcoin is the chain with the most PoW that started with Satoshi’s genesis block. That’s Bitcoin.  Currently BTC has almost 3x the cumulative PoW of BCH and that chasm is rapidly growing by the day.  See fork.lol for some stats if you’re curious to see a comparison between the two chains. 

If Bitcoin Cash or Bitcoin Pizza overtakes that in a decisive fashion, it’s now Bitcoin.  I suspect that’s unlikely.   But there’s only one chain that is Bitcoin.  If I fork and create my own coin, it’s not Bitcoin either.

That’s why I thought UASF was stupid(SegWit2x got us SegWit, not UASF, we should have done both at the same time cause we got burned on the minimal blocksize increase), it’s why I think all the bitcoin.com drama labeling BCH as Bitcoin is stupid, and it’s why I think forks with obvious lack of majority support like Bitcoin Pizza or Bitcoin Cash are stupid.

Right now hashpower is just following the price and bouncing back and forth between BCH/BTC based on whatever is most profitable. At the end of the day the chain with the most economic activity is going to win, because it will get the most security. I suspect that LN is going to hand that activity to BTC, and BCH will die a centralized death if it ever sees any real volume since it will be expensive to run a node at 32MB blocks in the near future. A centralized blockchain is just a really inefficient database and no longer interesting. If BCH never gets the economic volume, it will just die due to lack of transaction fees to incentivize miners as the reward keeps halving. 

Either way, I’m fairly sure that BCH is fucked in the long run.

I do think that we will eventually have 32MB and larger blocks on Bitcoin(I’d guess in the next 10 years), but that needs to be balanced with advancements in bandwidth, since that’s the true limitation, not disk space as so many useful idiots like to ramble on about around here.

"I didn’t say longest, I said most PoW.  With BCH’s current difficulty adjustment algorithm that’s not possible. The only reason that it got longer to start with is because the first DAA was poorly implemented and was abused by miners for profit. I hardly consider that a reason to leave the definition of Bitcoin up in the air. 

Waiting for the other chain to get longer is pointless, it will never happen. Even if BCH becomes completely worthless all it will take is a single CPU miner to keep extending it, BTC will never catch up in block count. That’s an incredibly poor metric to use, but to each their own, I suppose. 

I hope you kept some BTC...

Question, if BTC forked to a 1 min block time would you abandon BCH since BTC chain would quickly become longer?  If not, then your reasoning for leaving the definition ambiguous is definitely and obviously flawed, since you’re willing to leave it ambiguous based on an implementation detail of BCH, but not of BTC. 

And if so...well...all I can say is lol.

"At this point I kind of feel like I’m arguing with a literal bible interpreter.  The white paper is an excellent reference, but treating it as scripture is dangerous, IMO. You really don’t see why using longest chain as a metric is fallacious when the only reason it’s longer in the first place is due to BCH’s poor initial DAA implementation?

I do appreciate your civility, however. Oftentimes when debating BCH supporters it quickly devolves into non-productiveness.  See the person earlier asking me how much I paid for my vote manipulation bot as an example lol

"I know. You said most POW. While you may disagree with the ""longest"" being a valid/good metric it is what is said in the white paper. Several times it says ""longest proof-of-work chain"". Which is why I argue that one chain needs both to claim the dominant mantle. One can choose to ignore it or include it. But Satoshi could not have foreseen all possible bumps in the bitcoin road. I am sure if he knew what was about to happen a few years later he would have made most of his definitions and a clearer road map leaving things less up to interpretation. While I feel that BCH has the better chance of seeing global adoption I know that it is not up to me and that there are many possible outcomes. All it would really take is for one major government to officially recognize BTC as a valid currency and the entire market would probably swing in that direction despite my personal feelings. For that reason I have not sold all my BTC though I did sell some and bought BCH with it.
