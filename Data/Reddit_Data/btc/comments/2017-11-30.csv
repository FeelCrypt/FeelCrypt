"The same way they can refuse a dollar bill that the customer throws in their face, just send it back later. 

This will happen what, once per customer, before they learn to pay attention? Probably less than that because lots of people will know already.

This is an old post, but how can they *not* accept RBF transactions? Like, I the customer sends one they are going to get it either way. So the customer has to pay another transaction fee to send non-RBF, and the store would have to pay a transaction fee to send it back once it’s confirmed. Is that wrong? ;1;1;False;;dqjr3rr;Man buys coffee with Bitcoin in 2017;https://v.redd.it/tomvg4fqupzz
Unfortunately the merchant doesn’t have control over what wallets the customer uses or what features it has. Also,  if the business were to send it back later they’d have to eat the transaction fee or take it out of the customers portion and make them pay it twice which isn’t really ideal either. I just wish RFBs were fully reversible by the receiver.;1;0;False;;dqkkj15;Man buys coffee with Bitcoin in 2017;https://v.redd.it/tomvg4fqupzz

"**Samson Option**

The Samson Option is the name that some military analysts and authors have given to Israel's deterrence strategy of massive retaliation with nuclear weapons as a ""last resort"" against a country whose military has destroyed much of Israel. Commentators also have employed the term to refer to situations where non-nuclear, non-Israeli actors, have threatened conventional weapons retaliation, such as Yasser Arafat and Hezbollah.

The name is a reference to the biblical Israelite judge Samson who pushed apart the pillars of a Philistine temple, bringing down the roof and killing himself and thousands of Philistines who had captured him, crying out ""Let me die with the Philistines!"" (Judges 16:30).

An 8x increase in trade volume is nothing compared to a ddos attack. I think they need stronger systems in place. Don't get me wrong, I greatly appreciate what these exchanges are offering everyone.

"I'll need to learn more about the low-computing power currencies, as my assumption has been that less power has been needed because the problems are easier to solve (less secure) and less transactions. Regarding the centralization concerns: there are only 21,000,000 Bitcoin. Yes, they can be divided infinitely, but there is a maximum. To run the network, it will always require part of that maximum in fees. As time passes, the fees increase in size, and the transactions will decrease in size. So, as time passes, the cost of the transaction becomes are larger percentage of the transaction, eventually making it unuseful. This, in the long-term, will not function. So eventually the cap will need to be released, or the network will become useless.

The flip side is that while miners may be centralized (arguable), anyone can build, buy, and / or deploy new miners. The code does not stop this. So, in a free market, we will see more miners set up camp. Even if the sole purpose is to defend the network.

Only good thing is that they don't have big banker support. I like Crypto because it doesn't ""money multiply"". You have to show proof of work. Once the interest rate loving crowd comes in, we will see money multiplication measures in Crypto as well and that's precisely what I'm against. While granted that this is still better than the Central Banks deciding the values, ita still going to be dangerous in the end.

If only Burst coin didn't have all this shade, otherwise I really like the proof of capacity algorithm which users can run in their excess storage space.

This may be true. But then you are saying that the ""bag holders"" are the people left holding cryptocurrency. They are betting that cryptocurrency will not succeed. We are just now re-entering a time when merchant adoption can grow again, so I feel that those holding crypto will be much better off than in 2014. While it seems that this could be a pump and dump, I also feel that this may be the tipping point we've been seeking. Two forms of Bitcoin, both developing the tools to replace fiat. Each approaching from a different direction. Bitcoin Segwit is top down, working with banks. Bitcoin Cash is bottom up, starting with the general population.

"I completely agree, and thanks for the explanation. I totally can see both sides of the argument. Personally, the reason I lean towards smaller blocks is based on my distrust of the current financial system, and fear of the lengths that they're prepared to goto in order to maintain their level of control over the global financial systems. What happens if nodes become so big, only groups with enough resources (for example, financial institutions) become the sole operators of the worlds nodes? Isn't that exactly what we are trying to get away from?

But we don't.  This is a LIE sold by Blockstream as an excuse to limit scaling.

Satoshi said:

""Long before the network gets anywhere near as large as that, it would be safe 
for users to use Simplified Payment Verification (section 8) to check for 
double spending, which only requires having the chain of block headers, or 
about 12KB per day.  **Only people trying to create new coins would need to run 
network nodes.  At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the 
network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to 
specialists with server farms of specialized hardware.**  A server farm would 
only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with 
that one node.""

"Don't be dismayed, this is actually, IMO, a great conversation.

> Define ""secure"" to me. You probably can't give me a clear metric of what makes something secure. 

I have no interest in playing the shift the burden game. I am fully aware that many of the terms we have to use are nebulous.

> I could tell you a network with 10k nodes is decentralized. I could tell you a network with 100 nodes is decentralized.

You could, but you're not. That's the problem. You want to be able to use the buzzword but provide no metric on how it is applied.

I am asking YOU, specifically you, how you define the term centralization. If you cannot define it, even to yourself, how do you use it when in a discussion with others?

> The point is that the number isn't what matters.

It does when someone asks you how you, specifically you, define the term. 

> You're basically asking me ""how many cancer cells is few enough"". My answer isn't gonna be a number, it's ""as low as we can get it"". Does that mean cancer is a buzzword with no definition?

I'm not going to respond to this, and I think you know why.

I am asking you, specifically you, to define what centralization means to you. Did you think I was asking you to define it for everyone?

I completely understand that the terms ""centralization"" and ""decentralization"" are nebulous. I am fully aware that one person might deem node count, *and only node count*, to be the determining factor in whether or not Bitcoin, whatever flavor, is centralized or decentralized. 

My problem is/was that you use the buzzword as though it has authority even when you, it seems, have not realized how you define the term. While you said:

> There is no upper or lower limit. Things are either more or less centralized.

Then where's the middle? If you cannot define where the middle is, where the thing being discussed is in equilibrium, then you cannot even discuss whether the thing is more or less.

> Core wants to have less points, so it wants more centralization. 

Ok, I can see how one could come to this conclusion, I actually agree, but maybe not from the same data. 

Core purports to want everyone to be able to run a node. That's all well and good but if everyone cannot afford to use the network that the node is supporting then what is the use of running the node?

> I'd rather have as little of that as possible.

As little centralization as possible? We come right back to the problem where centralization is never defined, but using the term is acceptable to support any/every position.

> I don't want a set number, I want as little as possible.

Well, since no one has ever define what that ""set number"" is, we're very unlikely to ever have it, wouldn't you agree.

I probably came off as a complete ass, sorry. I was not trying to anger you, much. Just enough to make you think about what the term means to you. The term, centralization/decentralization has always pissed me off because the term is used to support every position, even polar opposite positions.

"It's very simple. (Simple to the point that if you don't understand it, you really shouldn't be buying Bitcoin or being a fanboi even because it's fundamental to how Bitcoin works at all.)

Miners put your transactions in blocks. Each transaction pays them a fee to get in the block. It costs money to do this. First they need to buy the computer, then they need to pay for the electricity to run it. Right now, they get some Bitcoin for doing this even if the block is empty. Eventually they will only get the transaction fees.

If the transaction fee you are paying is less than the cost of the electricity to put your transaction in the block, the only reason they would put it in the block is out of the goodness of their own heart. In doing so, they are literally giving you money for free. Don't count on them being that generous.

They have to generate the block, do the proof of work, and then announce the block before anyone else in order to get paid. With blocks that are only a few megabytes, they can do that pretty quick. But if the blocks were terabytes, they wouldn't be able to transmit them and prove they did it first before someone with a small block could, so it's risky to make huge blocks. The fees better be enough to compensate them for that risk.

If there were no blocksize limit, and the miners could make them as large as they wanted, they still wouldn't make multiterabyte blocks because they risk not getting paid at all. At some point they are going to stop making it bigger. And since they want the most money for that block, they are going to take the transactions that are paying the highest fees.

So if you spam the blockchain with massive amounts of low or zero transaction fee transactions, the miners aren't obligated to run them at all. They will take the ones worth it and the rest of the spam can fuck off. It will timeout and be ejected from the mempool eventually. The spam really doesn't matter that much. If it gets too bad, even the nodes will just start ignoring it.

The blocksize limit is really just a stopgap so that the miners don't have to reconfigure immediately. The miners can just take all the transactions above a certain lower baseline knowing that in the worst case they will mine a few max sized blocks full of crap fees before the have to get off their butts and raise the minimum. If it weren't there they might mine some really big blocks before they get around to reconfiguring.

"I understand your point but I don't think you're seeing mine. Centralization (to me) isn't something that can be defined with a set value. One might see a network with 10 nodes and assume it's decentralized whereas another might not be satisfied with 100 nodes. The number itself is actually entirely subjective and pointless to debate, which is why I've not given you a number or even cared to think about one.

But what you can define is the centralization itself. Imagine a slider. On one side is centralization, where there is only one ""node"". On the other side is decentralization, which extends infinitely (for the purpose of our argument, technically there are limits to decentralization like the number of computers on earth). I could tell you that the network is decentralized when it reaches this far on the slider (let's say 10k nodes, whatever), but then again someone else might think this still isn't decentralized enough.

My solution to this problem is just to ask for things to be as decentralized as possible. Not a set value, not a number of nodes, but just the act of choosing the choice that will lead to more decentralization every time. So I can't give you the exact, numerical definition you are looking for because decentralization is a concept, a value, a mantra to be followed, not something that can actually be measured. It can only be compared. A choice will lead to more or less centralization. A network has more or less centralization than another. And so on.

Just because you have a shitty connection doesn't mean Bitcoin cannot scale.

If you're using a shitty ISP on a shitty plan then you shouldn't be running full nodes. I don't see people in Korea and Sweden having problems.

**The only thing that matters in the Bitcoin network is the ring of interconnected super mining nodes that ensure your new transactions will reach 99% hash power within 3 seconds.**

Beyond that, full nodes is only useful to provide basic connection points, Validation base on historic transactions has to be done by the mining nodes again anyway, so what's the point checking it 10000 times, basic transaction validation doesn't require full copy of the blockchain, a thin node can provide that protection.

Scaling retards keep saying you need full nodes for protection, you don't, because if full node has the final deciding power then any billionaire can pay Amazon $50mil to run 5mil full nodes to take over the network.

"> Satoshi didn't envision the mining centralisation we have now.

This is a misunderstanding.  Satoshi himself said that miners would be ""big server farms"" and included an entire paragraph of the white paper to explaining that the mining incentive should even be sufficient to compel a 51% miner to mine honestly.  He clearly saw mining becoming a big industrial business highly centralized in a number of big players.  The key is merely to have enough big players in a variety of jurisdictions so that everyone keeps everyone else honest, which is still quite easy to maintain.

"Let me start with: I'm in favor of large blocks.  I think we can go to 32MB blocks with no problem, and that it probably will be fine to keep scaling up to significantly larger sizes - my guess at where there are concerns is closer to the gigabyte scale.

However, I'm not sure that is going to be sufficient.  It really depends on where we'll find utility for cryptocurrencies.  E.g, the completed transaction volume for NASDAQ seems to be in the order of 10,000 transactions/second, 
while the [actual traffic peaks at >2M tps in volatile periods](http://ir.nasdaq.com/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=768861) (numbers are a bit unclear, but it seems that a very large number of messages don't result in trades).

And this doesn't assume we want to scale to do microtransactions, which is where I believe the real promise for cryptocurrencies is: The ability to give computers limited amount of trust and transact based on that trust.  Cryptocurrencies aren't a great replacement for credit cards and banks due to the risk shifting; but they allow risk management in different ways, which opens new ways of doing things.

And if another cryptocurrency can do microtransactions much better and scale up to the real volume for serious financial transactions (probably about 100k transactions/sec at the moment) then bitcoin/bch may be left behind.  And in honor of the real inventions here (Satoshi did a quantum leap), I'd be sad to see that happen.

There it is folks.
Miners - y'know, the ones currently getting paid $150K every ten minutes - have both the incentives and the means to maintain the blockchain, without which the goose that lays their digital-gold eggs will die.

Satoshi didn't envision the mining centralisation we have now. He thought there would be a decentralised network of miners around the world, which is what the technology needs in order to remain censorship and crackdown resistant. With the way mining is centralised in Chinese ASIC farms, it is imperative that we maintain decentralisation of non-mining nodes. Otherwise, if China decides to block all bitcoin traffic, suddenly the entire system dies.

"I feel like you are missing what makes bitcoin so great: **social mobility**. 

The less people that mine, the less adoption there is going to be. Plain and simple. Its all about passive income. I want everything in my house mining bitcoin: my AC in summer, my heater in the winter, my refrigerator, my PC's, *everything*. Good bye job, now we can work on things we have always wanted too instead of begging to our bosses.  Even homeless people should be allowed to find an old smartphone and hook it up and mine and make a few bucks for themselves.

We have already reached the point where mining is centralized, and this happened years ago; but this is ok because right now because PoW is something that cannot be monopolized (due to the power and computations needed). But true adoption won't come until *everyone* can mine and use it for social mobility, and unless power becomes basically free, that will never happen with PoW. And even then it would take so long to mine something it would be pointless. Once the current price discovery ends, whether btc is 100k or $1,000,000 the hype will die down considerably, and if the only people who can make coins are high end miners, what is the point of getting into it for the average person? Or at least take enough time to care about it enough to switch his family or community over to using BTC instead of fiat.  

So no, big blocks are not the answer, because the answer isn't with bitcoin at all. It is just a stepping stone to something ***much much better***. Its all a band-aid, because PoW is only available to lucky and very small % of the population of the Earth, how is replacing the current 1% establishment with another 1% establishment (miners) any better than what we have now? it isn't.  

Being my own bank is nice, but being free from wage slavery is the true key, that is the true vision. People act like Satoshi is the founding fathers of America + Jesus rolled into one. Everything in computer science is built upon everything that came before it. Bitcoin and Satoshi is just a step, not the final form.

Scaling is a problem if you intent to use the blockchain between planets or solar systems.  Bandwidth is limited between planets.  Each planet would have its own sidechain for high bandwidth transactions and the 1mb (or smaller) blocks for transmission between planets.

"Bitcoin is only trustless and Peer to Peer if you run a full node which validates all the network rules. Without that the businesses which you are connecting to can change the rules without your permission and without your knowledge. Further those businesses, especially large miners, are going to be necessarily very visible and easy targets for State pressure and co-opting. Non-mining nodes aren't the only factor when it comes to decentralization, but arguing they aren't one at all is crazy to me. 

If Bitcoin keeps growing in its adoption and success eventually every single theoretical threat model is going to be tested against it. A system that relies on a handful of known miners and businesses is susceptible, it's only a marginal improvement over the centralized providers of past alternative currencies that have been easily taken down. A mesh network of lightweight, anonymous, and more easily concealable nodes is much more robust.

Storage isn't actually the bottleneck, it's bandwidth and processing power.

Yep, you're right, it's super cheap to run a node today, and it would be super cheap even to run an 8MB node, or a 16MB node. The problem is, if you have a listening node that serves SPV nodes or other nodes, bandwidth costs increase dramatically. 


There is a magic number (I'm not sure what, but some people have done the analysis before), where you need X full nodes for every XXX SPV nodes. 

Forgetting about centralisation questions entirely, you need a minimum number of full nodes that can **serve** all the SPV nodes that everyone should be using.

We also stil don't have fraud proofs on SPV nodes, which kinda sucks.

They also have the incentive to change it and make it as profitable as possible, it needs to scale *while* staying distributed, otherwise nodes get very concentrated and the incentive for those controlling them is to just make Bitcoin into a bank, where they modify the rules to maximize profit.

"Definitely, even the guy was shocked by one guy who was pumping out a decent hashrate back then.

He's human after all. 

What remains fundamentally important is that these unforeseen advancements don't break much of the core functionality of how the system works. Despite how some have viewed that ""1 cpu, 1 vote"" has been skewed since the existence of Asic's, anyone who is interested in taking part and ""voting"" can pull together the required resources in order to do so (This includes common individuals paying for cloud mining etc), plus the availability of high performance asic's that could be purchased and can be used by those interested to exert their own power.

Just like real life, what affects your ability to make changes to the world or a situation is the amount of power/money you have and the idea itself still exists regardless if asic's ever existed or not, as your conventional individual still wouldn't be able to compete with major Gpu mining farms as shown with cpu/gpu minable only crypto. 

Ultimately, the whole survival and continuation of bitcoin was also unforeseen by Satoshi as he put his bet that Moore's Law would remain true in the times to come in which it fortunately did.
Lastly, in addition to that was his doubts on what would happen to bitcoin when Wikileaks adopted it as their donation method after being blocked by Visa/Mastercard/Paypal etc and the mainstream media reported it as a sort of ""rouge/illegal money"".

"Great, I feel like my understanding of Lightning Network has progressed a lot from this thread.  I'm still not totally sold on it, for some reasons I'll get to in a moment, but it does seem like most of the threats I conceived of aren't actually possible.  I appreciate the time you've taken, and if you have any suggested further reading for me, other than the white paper, I'd love to check it out.  As you say, there's a lot to learn and I'm doing my best to sponge it up.  A few more thoughts:

>If the only links in the network are the one `A`⇆`B`⇆`C` you described, then no.

Okay, then I think I mostly understand how it works.  It seems like LN as a scaling solution is going to be somewhat dependent on liquidity providers, since insufficient liquidity will either require potentially convoluted re-routes or re-establishing channels.  What I don't quite understand is how closings work in a highly-interconnected network.  In the star topology you mentioned earlier, where `A` is a central node connecting `B` through `E`, imagine it connects to another star where `E` is the central node, with `F` through `J` as the points.  Say `B` is connected to `C` through `A`, and connected to `G` through `A` and `E`.  Can `B` close with `C` without also closing its channel to `A`?  If not, it seems like in a highly interconnected graph, channel closings could potentially cascade in a domino effect, potentially causing surges on the blockchain and also inconveniencing everyone who now has to re-open channels excluding the closed-out parties.

Another question: since liquidity providers are valuable (if not essential), what incentivizes them?  Do nodes charge fees for passing transactions through?  What mitigates the risk of centralization?  It seems like there's incentive among users to connect to nodes with more connections, and more connections requires more liquidity.  Likewise, aren't transaction speeds subject to connecting nodes being online?  The conventional wisdom in crypto is ""don't keep your funds in a hot wallet, they're more vulnerable!"", so unless that's just nonsense, running a highly-liquid Lightning node entails some extra amount of risk, so it seems like there must be some incentive if we expect enough liquidity providers to keep the system running efficiently.  I'm wondering what the incentive is and how it impacts other incentives within the ecosystem, like mining rewards and transaction fees.

>There's definitely different opportunities for failure here than with an on-chain transaction.

My take-away from this paragraph is that implementation is going to be the biggest factor in Lightning's success; it's a complex system, and mitigating that complexity through a well-designed interface will make a huge difference in the amount of risk exposure that users face.  As a late(ish) adopter, I'm lucky to have entered the crypto space with several user-friendly options--Coinbase, Exodus wallet, Ledger Nano S, etc.--but early adopters had to surmount significant obstacles.  One of my friends bought some Bitcoin many years ago, when Mt.Gox was just getting started, by mailing cash to someone he'd never met.  The community has come a long way since then, and if Lightning is really going to solve the current scaling issues during the rush of neophytes that will only intensify during 2018, it'll have to be close to fool-proof.  All theoretical issues aside, if the Core devs (et al) can bring something as complex as Lighting Network to the mainstream in a secure and user-friendly way, that will be an incredible achievement.  I'm tempted to make some kind of ""I'll eat my own dick"" wager that it won't happen, but TBH I really want to be wrong.  I hope Lightning turns out to be a raging user-friendly success.  But as I try to walk some friends and family through crypto basics NOW, without all the complexities Lightning may add, I'm skeptical that the devs can implement it in a way that doesn't over-expose the noobs to risk.  Say what you will about on-chain scaling, but at least it generally doesn't introduce any new user-facing complexities.";1;1;False;;dqjo8y0;"""Bitcoin.com wallet now displays ""Bitcoin Cash"" and ""Bitcoin Core"" balances.

"> Well, thank you for clearing up some of my misconceptions about Lightning Network. I've only been into crypto for a couple months, so your patience is appreciated! 

No problem! It gives me a chance to double-check my knowledge too, to make sure I can re-reference what I learned previously!

>`A` wants to send more funds [to `C`] than what `B` committed to the channel it opened with `C`; is it possible for `A`'s funds to go through?

If the only links in the network are the one `A`⇆`B`⇆`C` you described, then no. In that situation `A` would likely

 1. Look for another link in the network; possibly a `A`⇆`Z`⇆`C` exists, or a `A`⇆`W`⇆`X`⇆`Y`⇆`C` that can be used.
 2. Inform `B` their balance is low. If `B` is trying to set themselves up as a ""liquidity provider"" or ""hub"" in the network, they may notice on their own when one of their links is getting low, and would settle the `B/C` channel and start a new one. But if not, it's unlikely `A` would reach out to ask for that, since that would be tedious.
 3. `A` creates a new link to `C`. If they're intending to have some long-running transactions with `C`, this would be worthwhile.
 4. Make a standard transaction to `C`. If this is a one-off transaction they'll likely never repeat, this isn't a bad option, but it would probably be the last choice if one of the other, more economical options didn't work.

> It sounds like ""rebalancing"" allows parties to change their balance on the channel without broadcasting a new opening transaction to the blockchain.

""Rebalancing"" is the term they use for what I was calling ""updating the state of the channel""; note the wiki says it's a ""process between Alice and Bob when they adjust their balances **within the channel**""; it's not bringing in funds from outside the channel once the channel's open, it's only changing the split of who gets what from the funds that are already in the channel.

> if I opened a channel to, say, Netflix, I wouldn't open it with a balance large enough to cover every payment I will ever make to them

Very true; services like Netflix are monthly subscriptions, where most people pay monthly, since pre-paying for a year's worth of access they don't have on-hand all at once. Paying for Netflix monthly with a payment channel wouldn't make much sense. But think of what that monthly payment already represents: You pay at the beginning of the month to pre-pay for a month's worth of daily access. If at some point in the month you want to cancel your subscription, Netflix would probably refund you the fraction of the month you didn't use. But that means you **trust** Netflix to do that refund if you choose to drop the service. If you have some terrible user experience and want to ragequit, you still have to make a phone call and be somewhat civil on the line to hopefully get a reimbursement. If instead Netflix transitioned to a payment channel method, where at the beginning of the month you put in your monthly payment amount, and then *every day* you do a state-change (or ""rebalance"") so a little more of the funds get allocated to Netflix, and then finally at the end of the month close it out, you've got effectively the same payment reconciliation rate (you don't have to put down a year's worth of payments ahead of time, and Netflix doesn't have to wait a year to get paid), but there's the added benefit that at any time *either party* could close the contract without additional trust needed.

> It still seems like there's more opportunities for failure here than with normal on-chain transactions.

There's definitely *different* opportunities for failure here than with an on-chain transaction. But think back to when you first got into Bitcoin and got told a ton of new vocabulary terms like ""hashing function"", ""merkle tree"", ""proof of work"", ""ECDSA"", etc. With an on-chain transaction, if a script is malformed, or a node is under a sibyl attack, or someone posts their private key instead of a public key, those are all opportunities for failure. There is a learning curve with on-chain transactions, but you've progressed to the point where you labeled them ""normal"". Lightning Networks are a new idea, and another learning curve to tackle, definitely.

>>Actually, I believe to a core client, it's not technically valid. So yes, the miner is propagating a block with an invalid transaction in it.

>Right, but again, this requires Core clients to make up the majority of the network, doesn't it?

Yes, it requires the majority of the nodes in the Bitcoin peer-to-peer network to agree that Segregated Witness transactions are to be treated a certain way. Segregated Witness was added in [core v0.13.1](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/segregated-witness-officially-introduced-with-release-of-bitcoin-core-1477611260/), so anything higher than that would meet that requirement. Taking a look at https://bitnodes.earn.com/nodes/ right now, I see them reporting of the 11,319 nodes in their view, at least 8,100 are running versions of Core v0.13.1 or higher. That's about 71.5%, which is well above a majority. And at least 1,000 of the nodes in its list are running Bitcoin Cash versions, which would never participate in the Bitcoin Core side of the blockchain, so it could be considered more like 78% of the network is supporting Segregated Witness transactions and addresses.";1;1;False;MidnightLightning;dqj522e;"""Bitcoin.com wallet now displays ""Bitcoin Cash"" and ""Bitcoin Core"" balances.
