Snake confirmed.

You really tried to slither your way out of that one. Not buying. Clearly your implication is that I am trying to move the goal posts and you are not. Maybe try re-arranging your words some more until you find a sentence that could convince someone with an IQ of 80 that you're telling the truth.

> Its actual a simple concept and doesnt require this dancing youre doing to try and create a narrative around what defines bitcoin and what doesnt. Look, you seem to be on the side that wants to take over Bitcoin as BCH and thats fine, I dont actually care either way but your team lost. You now picked up an olympian level of mental gymnastics to try and explain it to yourself and I dont really care.

Ignoring for a moment how nonsensical your comment is; you appear to be describing your own actions not mine. I'm the one giving clear definitions and citing my claims.

Rather than being upfront you're doing these strange, [round-about dances](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/9dlmsf/this_sub_is_under_major_attack/e5ikalq/) providing strange alternative explanations for reality.

Unlike you, I don't have to hide my real agenda. I can be open and upfront about everything I think and I know that many intelligent and good people will appreciate my words.

I think you know that your true motivations may be repulsive to intelligent and good people, so you will always have to slither, wriggle and deceive if you want even the slightest chance at being accepted by them. That sounds stressful way of being. Maybe if you're naturally snake-like it isn't though.

> Thats what this was about. I now see your concept of bitcoin is skewed enough that you cant do that due to the required square dancing to see your view. So like I said, nevermind. Thanks Anyways. Dont be mad I wont drink the kool-aid, we should still be friends, k?

The thing about being a deceptive, manipulative snake is that you will invariably start to become disconnected from reality and lose your grounding. Your true inner feelings will be betrayed when you talk about others. For example:

* When you talk about me or other Bitcoin (BCH) supporters drinking the ""kool-aid"", all I think is: hmm, this guy probably feels like he's part of a cult. 
* When you say ""we should still be friends"" I think, this guy probably doesn't have any real close relationships due to his manipulative and unappealing nature. 
* When I read ""your concept of bitcoin is skewed"", I think: this guy probably doesn't understand Bitcoin very well. He probably doesn't have a clear and coherent view of Bitcoin in his mind.

Because the assumption that anyone who posts ""fuck bcash"" is a troll and will always be a troll is wrong.

People can have an honest change of heart. There is so much FUD around in the crypto space, and the channels of communication so censored, that it's no wonder that people come here spewing ""fuck bcash"". One of the big gripes is how censored /r/bitcoin is right? It shouldn't be any surprise that the propaganda machine is churning out people posting ""fuck bcash"",

"I'll break this down really fast for you.  These are just my opinions.  Others might disagree.

1.  one of the greatest risks banks face is that any sufficiently-permissioned employee can steal at will.  vetting employees and monitoring them, and maintaining complex multi-layered security is hard!

2. lightning would allow a bank to create accounts for its customers that employees can't steal from

3. this greatly would reduce the cost of the insurance that banks have to maintain, as well as saving the insurance companies a lot of money in payouts.

4. AXA is a primary shareholder in Blockstream.  AXA is the world's largest provider of banking insurance.

5. Lightning, as a technology, might be able to enable a decentralized routing platform.  However, capital, in the form of wealth, is far from ""evenly distributed.""  it is a based fact that in **all** economies, the top 1% or less of wealth holders, hold the vast amount of wealth.  To move significant funds on a Lightning network requires that there be interconnected channels all of which are highly liquid - ie, have lots of wealth locked up in them.  You and I can't play that game.  Banks can play that game.

6. Lightning is cross-currency compatible.  That means that any currency can be used in a Lightning network.  Not just BTC.  But even a currency that resembles Tether - digital USD - where a group of people control the supply.  Which means that the liquidity in the channels could come from fiat.

You can connect the dots I'm sure.

I advise you to read with an open mind.  I and a lot of others here are early supporters of the Bitcoin project because we believed that a stateless form of money that couldn't be manipulated by a powerful few would be a net boon to humanity, not because we wanted Lambos.  We also realized early on that the project had the potential to disrupt very powerful entities.  We also realized early on that a centralized development team would be easy to corrupt.

The answer everyone gave each other back then was, ""if that happens, we can just fork the coin.""  Little did we understand how that would actually play out in real life.

">""we're"". Do you mean ""you're""?

No. I said we're because it is we are. We, as in the participants of the conversation. We as in you wanted me to go down a rabbit hole that requires us (see: we) to move the goalposts and im not interested.

&#x200B;

Its actual a simple concept and doesnt require this dancing youre doing to try and create a narrative around what defines bitcoin and what doesnt. Look, you seem to be on the side that wants to take over Bitcoin as BCH and thats fine, I dont actually care either way but your team lost. You now picked up an olympian level of mental gymnastics to try and explain it to yourself and I dont really care.

>Do you want me to hold your hand more?

Thats what this was about. I now see your concept of bitcoin is skewed enough that you cant do that due to the required square dancing to see your view. So like I said, nevermind. Thanks Anyways. Dont be mad I wont drink the kool-aid, we should still be friends, k?

&#x200B;

EDIT - 

&#x200B;

As a note, not related to the basis of this conversation but bitcoin in general,  I really enjoy the archaic and antiquated thinking behind a technology. As if knowing computers, the thought that things might evolve to suit the use is lost to this community. How its constantly called an experiment, almost beta in its way of finding bugs and changing to the environment to fix what sounded good but ended up not being useful.

&#x200B;

It reminds me of that time when God said we should stone people to death for mixing fabrics. Or that time that mining pools were not considered in the original implementation but no one takes issue with that. 

&#x200B;

I enjoy the ""satoshi's vision"" and the C++ code tidbit but the reality is, the very nature of a decentralized platform dictates that the consensus of the community, not the code behind it, is what drives the true Bitcoin. So as you guys continue to immortalize his self admitted experiment in beta early work and hang on his every word and punctuation, you might find that it turns into a bit of fantasy like LoTR or perhaps even a cult like religion similar to the bible.

Here are Satoshi's precise words:

Line 1 of the [white paper](https://www.bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf) is:

> Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System

On the first sentence of the conclusion on page 8 of the [white paper](https://www.bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf), Satoshi says:

> We have proposed a system for electronic transactions without relying on trust.

"> downvote individual comments

This is the mistake.  I used to agree with this, until I started to understand the problem better.  This allows trolls to farm karma by posting divisive yet upvotable comments, usually in the form of ""concern posts"" about individuals (not ideas) -- like posts CSW being a fraud or whatnot -- and then reuse this karma to post blatant attacks in the sub.

1. When you spot these blatant attacks ""bcash btrash scamcoin"" etc then you should tag these people in RES with an unmistakable tag.  That way when they post something later that you happen to agree with, you'll know **not** to feed them karma

2. You should think critically about posts that are upvoted but divisive, particularly attacks on unpopular people.  Before blindly clicking upvote, see if the person you're upvoting is most likely a shill or disruptor.  Remember that disruptors play on emotional topics to farm karma.

**Don't feed the trolls**

Then uses that karma to turn around and post ""bcash btrash your shitcoin is going to zero bagholder"" in another thread.

Personally, that's why I have been here more than r/bitcoin the last few weeks, keeping my eye on those pushing a narrative who's only value seems to be marketing it as something it isn't via an authority figure's ownership of a prominent website and frequent mass media news show appearances.

\>We just proved we can scale 20x past BTC. So now the gloves are really off.

Judging by the market's complete lack of interest in the results of the stress test I suggest you put on headgear ;-)

What makes you think these ""attacks"" are from outside your own community? A lot of the new accounts seem to have read about BCH recently and decided in a short space of time that CSW is a visionary or claim to be very knowledgeable (considering their brief account times, seems unlikely) as to why ABC is the way to go.  Perhaps it is the actions of the handful of millionaires and billionaires currently vying for control of BCH, have you though of that? They have millions on the line and are arguing over control of it. When you take a minority of users and fork off under the lead of a few men who have been pushing conflict for years and buddying up to people like CSW to try and gain credibility, what else do you expect?

"Perhaps this is a reasonable word shortening method, but you should know that the word ""bcash"" was specifically created by the Bitcoin Core cult as a term to distance and disassociate Bitcoin Cash from ""Bitcoin"". They don't want people to see any association of BCH with Bitcoin.

Going by Satoshi's description of Bitcoin, the BTC chain is no longer Bitcoin. However, the Bitcoin Core cult know that the word ""Bitcoin"" carries value with it, so they want to change BTC into something not-Bitcoin but still keep the ""Bitcoin"" name in order to misappropriate value from it.

BCH is Bitcoin

Bcash is a stupid made up word by a cult.

BTC is best referred to as Bitcoin Core. This is because Bitcoin Core is the organisation that centrally plans the BTC chain.";6;2;False;hapticpilot;e5ithj1;This sub is under major attack;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/9dlmsf/this_sub_is_under_major_attack/
"""bcash"" is the psyop and always has been and you're either complicit or a hypocrite because the shorthand is BCH.

Why do you think BCH is Bitcoin rather than BTC? Would you please recommend an article discussing the differences between developers and development goals? (I'm new.);2;0;False;eo6x;e5juxbt;This sub is under major attack;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/9dlmsf/this_sub_is_under_major_attack/
"I noticed that. In the link he gave, he was the 'blamed' user for the change that throttle transaction transmission.

*What a wonderful little coincidence that his improvement to the Bitcoin Core code base just so happened to further limit the ability of the Bitcoin full node software to handle more on-chain transactions.*

*Sometimes it seems like his actual goal is to the limit the adoption of Bitcoin.*

*But no. It couldn't be. It must just be coincidence. I'm sure he really does have good intentions and his alternative design for Bitcoin with 2nd layer scaling, really is better than Satoshi's design and really will bring us a wonderful decentralised world of cheap, permissionless money for everyone... in just 18 months*

You BCash people are insane. r/btc mods remove posts too. The hypocrisy is hysterical. Your shitcoin is failing hysterical and you people bitch and moan. BCash is centralized and defeats the entire purpose of bitcoin.
