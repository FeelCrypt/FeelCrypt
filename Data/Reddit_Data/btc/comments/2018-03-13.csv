Bitcoin Cash is an adoption route. The idea is not to hinder consumer adoption.

It is pretty much the most important measure against centralization and the most crucial ideological goal.

If LN is satisfactory and competitive, people would start preferring that over on-chain transactions. Presumably on Bitcoin Cash.
