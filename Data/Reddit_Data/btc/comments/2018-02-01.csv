"Ok everyone, gather round.  

See how the troll falsely stated that the picture was fake?  An easily debunked lie, because trolls are not smart.  If they were, they’d stop leading such sad lives trolling internet strangers.

Now, look closely at the trolls reaction once called out.  Did they prove their point?  Provide evidence?

Nope!  They use terms like Bcash and bring up more, completely unrelated, false statements with, again, zero evidence to back it up.

Now, I risk this troll changing his tactics by telling you what they usually do next, and that’s insults, name calling, basically trying to get you riled up enough to be as toxic as they are so they can infect our community with their childish behavior.

Just remember, trolls are sad people to be pitied. After all, if they had reasonable sources for their claims, and presented them without immaturity, they wouldn’t be trolls.  They’d be normally functioning human beings.

"> There is an observation that by expanding mere capacity, that capacity is used and you're left with about as much capacity as you had before.


I don't disagree that the extra capacity will be expanded into, the mistake is thinking you are not much better off.


by expanding capacity we allow more users to use the network, this scales the usefulness of the network quadratically See [Metcalfe's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe%27s_law).  this seems to be held up by real world data at current low blocksizes from Peter R's  [data](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=400235.msg5882283#msg5882283) on bitcointalk. 


> The LN solves for this observation. 


no it doesn't it's problematic on a tiny network never mind working at scale, your pinning your hopes on  something that is unclear whether it will work out. see routing problems, constant hot wallets, stateless vs statefull tx's, node exhaustion etc


> What we need is more efficient transactions so that when the capacity is used up, we've already exhausted every other attempt at fitting more transaction data in.


that would bee nice, but you cannot know you have exhausted every other possible way to shrink tx size, in reality it is a tradeoff, increasing the network effect is by far the best bang for the buck at the present time.

"**Metcalfe's law**

Metcalfe's law states that the value of a telecommunications network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system (n2). First formulated in this form by George Gilder in 1993, and attributed to Robert Metcalfe in regard to Ethernet, Metcalfe's law was originally presented, c. 1980, not in terms of users, but rather of ""compatible communicating devices"" (for example, fax machines, telephones, etc.). Only later with the globalization of the Internet did this law carry over to users and networks as its original intent was to describe Ethernet purchases and connections.

"Sadly, crypto is confusing. And we do have a duty to demystify it. But people do have a right to at least have a chance of learning about the differing versions of Bitcoin, and their pros and cons (something banned in /r/bitcoin). I think perhaps you underestimate people’s abilities to grasp there are two versions (even more in fact) of Bitcoin. Or perhaps you just secretly wish BCH didn’t exist. I seriously doubt the 3 letter path to this sub, is causing some kind chaos in the space. I know of several new users to the space who loosely understand there are two versions, and that they are scaling in differing ways with differing trade offs. They tend to buy bitcoin because they “want the more expensive one”, and “isn’t that other one a scam?” but when they learn of current limitations some have also bought Cash. The general pulse at the moment seems to be people’s disbelief in the sustainability of “digital gold”, and a gut instinct that it needs to be usable as cash to survive. This sub provides an alternative to the digital gold narrative.

I think if this sub post dated the creation of bch you would have a more compelling argument, but it’s not. It’s a bitcoin sub with differing moderation policies to /r/bitcoin. It allows free and open discussion about many coins, and bch just happens to get a lot of coverage.";2;1;False;heffer2k;dtkugm9;Bitcoin Cash - Life's a BCH!;7uhy0o;https://i.redd.it/4nzysvukzkd01.jpg

">Why not? Because there's practical limits to bandwidth, especially when we consider people who more urgently need crypto in less developed countries like Venezuela. Common sense should prevail on that one.

The whole concept behind Bitcoin is that everyone is selfish. As soon as the protocol requires people to not act in their own self interest, we may as well go back to fiat.

People in less developed countries don't need to verify blocks to send and receive Bitcoin.

>Also, Tipprbot working on an exponentially less used network isn't a good proof of concept. If we actually want BCH to become a practical currency saying ""no durr increase block size"" is not pragmatic as the trade volume vs other currencies right now is dismal.

    <Bitcoin Core transaction rate> / <Bitcoin cash transaction rate>

Not an exponential expression.

Since you havent actually provided any evidence of these assertions, I'll just turn this around on you: ""no durr don't increase the block size"".  
My argument is now just as logical as yours.

>There's a reason scalability and computer science use Big O and why calculus focuses on the derivative for rate of growth vs the base number.  Scalability implies more than just throwing a few MBs. If you're making this argument as a primary one, it's basically showing a lack of common sense and knowledge about algorithms and big data. If this is the common sentiment for BCH investors that's not good because it implies there is no consideration for practical concerns with adoption (and they're not gonna be adequately emphasized by the community).

Strawman. Big O describes computational complexity / performance, not storage, which still remains at O(1) to store a transaction. Is this the Core latest talking point? Really gotta try harder.

I'll let you know when the size of TV shows stop growing exponentially as resolution increases. I guess this is the end of times for entertainment. Or maybe I could point to the exponential increase in available storage, or bandwidth or any of the other Moore's law lookalikes. I think we'll be fine.

"/u/vbuterin this is an outright lie; which you are presumably making to wave away your motivations for a premine now valued in billions of dollars.

If it were true, you'd be able to point to specifically public communication where you attempted any such thing.  You cannot because you simply didn't do it-- not that it would have made any sense in any case.

You can run your little scam however you like, but if you tell lies like this you will get called out.

"I recommend not reading sensationalist headlines and clicking through to my actual words:

> “The very earliest versions of ETH protocol were a counterparty-style metacoin on top of primecoin. Not Bitcoin because the OP_RETURN wars were happening at the time and given what certain core developers were saying at the time, I was scared that protocol rules would change under me (eg. by banning certain ways to encode data in txs) to make it harder, and I did not want to build on a base protocol whose development team would be at war with me,” said Buterin.

It is true that I never actually attempted to make ethereum a meta-protocol on top of bitcoin, unless you count my few weeks working on the Mastercoin protocol and back in October as part of the ""making ethereum"" process. The OP_RETURN drama pre-emptively pushed me toward building ethereum on Primecoin instead of Bitcoin. The primecoin plan was scrapped because we ended up getting more attention and resources than we expected, and so we could build our own base layer and add upgrades like ASIC-resistant PoW and state trees.

And by the way, the ""I made a separate blockchain so I could have a premine"" bit is itself very much fake news. I don't remember whether or not Mastercoin had a premine, or the distribution was 100% sold to initial buyers, but Mastercoin is a separate currency despite being on top of Bitcoin, so it's totally possible to make a Mastercoin-like thing with a premine.";1212;24;False;vbuterin;dtli9fg;Vitalik Buterin tried to develop Ethereum on top of Bitcoin, but was stalled because the developers made it hard to build on top of Bitcoin.
