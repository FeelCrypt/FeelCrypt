"Why is bitcoin the real bitcoin? Who gets to decide which part after a fork is the real deal and the other not?  
I believe most of the people who say ""bitcoin is bitcoin"" and ""bitcoin cash is obviously not bitcoin"" define what bitcoin is based mainly on which client the exchanges and mining pools where running when the fork happened.
Had the exchanges and mining pools favored the other side, which one would be bitcoin?  
All I'm saying is that BOTH are Bitcoin, and we can argue all day long about which one has more merit than the other, but saying that one is bitcoin and another isn't because someone else dictated it defeats the whole premise of decentralization, trustlessness and ""validating for yourself""..

He has become awakened, realized that Bitcoin Cash is the real Bitcoin, and that Bitcoin Legacy only has a veneer and a facade of being Bitcoin.  Bitcoin Legacy is an imposter coin, and is only held up by propaganda, censorship, and mindless sheep, or ignorant people.  Probably the reason you even hold alts instead of Bitcoin is because of BlockStream Core's policy of high fees and unreliable transactions, the Bitcoin dominance index went from like 90% to like 35% or something crazy.  This was all because of Core's incompetence.  If we were allowed to do on-chain scaling, we would have everything focused on Bitcoin and you would probably hold Bitcoins instead of speculating on alts.;9;1;False;cryptorebel;dw0eq0k;I’m here to eat shit and admit I was wrong, other new people take my warning;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/85uo6j/im_here_to_eat_shit_and_admit_i_was_wrong_other/

">I was one of the people who didn’t think the troll problem was actually that bad until I started posting pro-BCH things.

On r-bitcoin that's an almost insta-ban, and for good reason. The amount of attacks from BCH towards Bitcoin have been many and extremely vicious. (If you're wondering about examples, I'll just mention Roger going on air with the harshest words towards Bitcoin. Disagreeing with the scaling approach is one thing, shitting on what made you rich is a different story altogether.)  The reaction is normal. 

BCH has a special place on r-bitcoin: Promote BCH in any sense, shape or form, and you get a ban. (It's not as strict with the the other alts.) it's only normal.

&nbsp;

>And wow, do people really come after you for it in most subs it’s terrifying.

Leave r-bitcoin aside. If everyone outside this sub is telling you BCH is questionable, doesn't that make you think? Why does EVERYONE outside of this sub think poorly of BCH? You've got two options

* One, everyone outside this sub is an idiot,

* Two, there's something to it.

If you talk to the Scientology people, everyone is out there to get them. And David Miscavige is the true hero that is carrying the torch, bringing the true light to the masses.


I understand that the ""us vs THEM"" thing is very seductive, it makes you believe you're part of something bigger. It's David vs Goliath. You're gonna win, you're better than everyone else. Unquestionably seductive. But you really need to question *yourself*, not the tech, for choosing one of the above options vs the other.

"You should reach your own conclusions, based on the merits of logic and reasoning. For me it's simple, I want my preferred crypto to be as good as Cash. So I'm doing what I can get to get retail adoption in my area. If people have other views and goals it's fine. I've been in countries where the USD is used just as much as the local currency. That's what I wish for BCH.

The price and investment qualities don't matter much to me if I can't go to a brewery and buy some beer. That's when magic internet money becomes more real money to me.

I also believe that you can't build an economy if the poor are excluded. It needs to be all inclusive. I don't see crypto as a get rich quick scheme, but as another option for people to earn money and value. It's a ponzi if the only game is to get more people in and it's a game of hot potato. It's not a ponzi if you forget about exiting and focus on digging in and staying in it forever.

I feel like all this will reflect in the price eventually, but as I said. The price of BCH doesn't matter to me, I just want to buy beer locally with it.

https://tipPLS.me my project. I want to show people how to earn an honest living with BCH, that is all. If that draws scammer accusations, I welcome them wholeheartedly because they are fools. I'm just trying to show normal people another option that hurts no one, except indirectly to those invested in the other solution. Those invested in the other side are free to use my tactics, but they won't. I've given probably 200 people in my local community their first ever crypto. And I just started. I don't know what will happen, but maybe they will demand the breweries to accept it and I have my victory.

The BCH community is an organic one, and moves in strange directions, myself included, but generally in the same direction of making it as good as Cash. I'm comfortable with my efforts of making it cash because I know others are doing the same.

This is a general guideline to the community's actions.  It's why trolls don't really faze us. We're about bringing people in, not keeping people out. The ""bcash bcash bcash"" trolls are the only ones trying to keep people away. I'm having a ton of fun giving people their first bitcoin and maybe even getting a chance to educate them and learn from them.

"It's different for everyone.

For me, the breaking point was the realization I had spent hundreds of dollars in fees to move BTC last fall (when the mempool was clogged). This created a conflict because the original vision that I bought into was outlined in the original Bitcoin whitepaper. It's hard to have financial sovereignty when it's extremely costly to move your funds (this also excludes the poor from this new technology). I also didn't believe Lightning to be the answer based on my research.

For others, it's a technical decision (getting to the scaling debate). Others it's philosophical and idealogical (getting to the original vision set forth in the whitepaper). Some will hold equal amounts BTC and BCH to hedge. Some live off of Bitcoin and pay for things with it. Some of us still hope for the best with Lightning but have a large amount of skepticism. Others hate the idea. 

It's important you ask the questions that are important to you, do your own research, think for yourself, and come to your own conclusion.

"But here's the thing: The rivalry, or deep fundamental disagreement, predates the split in the communities and the projects, it is actually the reason for the split.  
If we did not disagree, it would still be a single project, so asking the split communities to not believe that their vision is the best choice is kind of nonsensical.  
And how do you justify that ""Both aren't Bitcoin""? Let's take another open source fork example: When popcorntime forked, weren't both versions ""popcorntime""? If you understand how open source project forks work, please explain why should one side keep the name (and who decides which side that is?) and the other be expected to change, or else be accused of being scammy?

"It was a little rude... these things get easily heated. I'll give it a shot, let me know how I go. 

I'd start by flipping the question: what makes BTC ""the real bitcoin"" and not BCH? None of the current devs were there at the start, and many of those who jumped on board early have thrown their support behind BCH. Like BTC, BCH is a complete chain of transactions and signatures (from the fork) all the way back to the genesis block. But, unlike BCH, BTC has made it crystal clear that it is no longer committed to many of the ideas that Satoshi presented in the white paper and elaborated in the early emails and forum posts. On this, I think a nuanced picture of the events that led to the fork, and how the big blockers were shut out of development and ""blocked"" at every point possible from influencing the development of the project complicate matters.

But anyway, who awards these names? Is BTC ""the real bitcoin"" simply because it has the ticker? Because it has greater market value? Because the GitHub is the same? And, what would you say if the market cap was reversed? Or if all the current devs of Bitcoin BTC were replaced by a new bunch who took the project in a completely different direction, whilst the old ones, seeking to preserve the current vision, forked their own chain to preserve it? Which would you call Bitcoin then? 

In the end, I do think it is all a bit arbitrary. As long as we get secure, deflationary, peer-to-peer electronic cash, I'm happy. I just think that BCH has a much better chance of achieving it, and it's interesting that they're doing it by sticking pretty closely to what Satoshi suggested.";5;0;False;CatatonicAdenosine;dw0ju0m;I’m here to eat shit and admit I was wrong, other new people take my warning;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/85uo6j/im_here_to_eat_shit_and_admit_i_was_wrong_other/

You really think BCH will win? BCH is not Bitcoin, as much as influential people like Roger Ver assert that it is. You think out of all the various cryptocurrencies, that BCH will somehow rise to the top over all the others, including Bitcoin? Why? So far, nothing in the marketplace has shown any evidence of that, other than a few pumps. At what point do you think BCH is going to breakout and displace Bitcoin? Why even try and call BCH Bitcoin? What will you say in a year or two when the ratio of value is even more uneven than it already is? At what point do you call it quits? Also, why do you think /r/Bitcoin represents BTC when /r/BTC represents BCH?

"Welcome home friend, this is why we shouldn't ban trolls.  We need to encourage trolls as much as possible.  That is how we wake people up.  Not only that, but imagine the number of lurkers reading who saw the same discussions as OP and were awakened or swayed.  Even if you get in a troll fight with someone, often times they will go away rethinking things, even if they don't admit it up front because of ego or whatever.

 At the end of the day its like two breeding grounds.  Here in Bitcoin Cash Land we have the people who were able to see and envision things, people who are able to admit when they are wrong or mislead, people who are capable of critical thinking, people willing to go against the crowd even in the face of political attacks, and character assassination.  Bitcoin Cash is breeding a strong community of Liberty minded capitalists, intent on bringing economic freedom world wide.  Then on the Core side you have a bunch of brainwashed, domesticated sheep, who bow to censorship and propaganda, bow down to political pressure, and peer pressure, bow down to authoritarianism and blockstream, only know how to parrot narratives and attack Roger Ver and Jihan.
