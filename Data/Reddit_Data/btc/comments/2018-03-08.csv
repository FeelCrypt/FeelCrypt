These people are closing the door used by Trump so that others cannot do what Trump did, especially since mid term elections are just around the corner.

"That's true up to a point, but youtube has created the expecation of non-censorship, but has now changed this.  Those that have contributed to and built on and for the platform are now being censored.  The time spent has destroyed the trust and could possibly result in lawsuits for breach of contract (implied).

It is very similar to what Theymos did.  The expectation (implied contract) was one of non-censorship, but instead turned into a system of control.  

To claim that this is fair game ignores the fact that if the rules (implied contract) indicates that they were not going to be politically bias.  If youtube and theymos indicated up front that the the TOS will be used to remove content of a political nature, and people still posted and got content removed, then, yes that would be fair game.

If we are to apply ""fair game"" to all web sites, then over time social media sites will continually be bought out and subverted because the TOS and implied contracts mean nothing.  There's nothing to stop deep pockets from buying out or threatening/subverting key individuals and then having the content they don't like removed.

Trump is really irrelevant (in this context). Whichever way you slice it and whoever benefited, there was definitely non-grassroots manipulation of the internet during the last cycle and it's only going to get worse (not just for politics). Everyone interested in free, balanced expression should come together and see if we can work together to find a way to lessen the voices of these influences, preferably in a way that doesn't result in echo chambers (though if you want that, that's fine). You hate Hillary? Fine. You hate Trump? Fine too. let's find a way to make your voice mean something.

2.

Relevant passage:

> Ich vertrete weiterhin den Standpunkt, dass es sich bei Bitcoins nicht um Geld im rechtlichen Sinne, sondern schlicht um Waren handelt (im Detail dazu hier). Vor diesem Hintergrund erkenne ich unter Umständen für Einnahmen eine Steuerpflicht auch für Privatpersonen: Voraussetzung ist aber, dass zwischen An- und Verkauf weniger als 1 Jahr liegt. Hintergrund ist, dass es sich bei Bitcoins nach aktueller Einschätzung wohl um „sonstige Wirtschaftsgüter“ i.S.d. §23 I Nr.2 EStG handeln wird. Einnahmen aus Veräußerung sind als sonstiges Einkommen zu versteuern (§22 Nr.2 EStG), wenn „der Zeitraum zwischen Anschaffung und Veräußerung nicht mehr als ein Jahr beträgt“.
