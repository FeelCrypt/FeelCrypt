"[Yes](https://www.amazon.com/Antminer-~4-73TH-25W-Bitcoin-Miner/dp/B014OGCP6W), you can buy mining hardware for less than that.  Whether the hardware would be *profitable* is a different question.  The one I linked to draws 1.25 kW, and if you are paying retail for electricity, it may not be.

Many people these days mine other cryptocurrencies (altcoins = alternative coins), which can often be done with standard graphics cards.  If you already have a suitable one, you can skip the hardware cost, but you still have to pay whatever the cost of running it is.  If you want one of the flavors of bitcoin in the end, the altcoin can be traded on an exchange.

My knowledge of mining is out of date, since I stopped in 2013, when my graphics card was no longer competitive.

"> This is a tragedy of the commons. Even if it's best to be stable for the group. For the individual it's best to mine what's most profitable right now.

The majority of mining power talk to each other (witness the New York Agreement).  Thus they *de facto* form a cartel which can work in their common interest.  If they were completely disconnected, then what you claim might happen.

Historically, the tragedy of the commons, as in overgrazing common land, didn't happen that often.  The commons was shared land in a village, and the villagers knew each other and whose sheep or cattle were being grazed there.  They had agreements about how many and how long the livestock could graze, and violators could be punished.

It happens more commonly today with, for example, western ranchers overgrazing federal land.  The BLM staff are not as local and don't count the herds, so you can get away with it more easily.  Environmental pollution is also harder to track to the source, so people get away with it.";6;2;False;danielravennest;dlvqwt8;Block 479808 has been mined! Difficulty now 7 % of BTC!

Because most businesses don't need to spend your $2 immediately and since the money is guaranteed anyway why not allow you the convenience of low fees and instant purchases?

Keyword: _immediately_ 

Yes, eventually they'll need the money but why not let you use the channel for a month before closing it? It improves customer satisfaction with no added cost. 

>I thought routing wasn't solved yet. Can you link to any new info about LN routing?

I'm honestly not sure, but I think the issue is with dynamic routing like internet packets. Simply routing through a hub is simple enough. 

>So testnet means very little to me since you can't test economic behavior on testnet.

What economic behavior do you need to test for something like this? You either open the channel directly with the business or with a hub that takes a fee for allowing you to connect to multiple businesses without creating new channels for each one. 

More complicated use cases might be possible but these two are simple enough that I can't understand what economic issues you think might happen.

"> Simply routing through a hub

A hub would have to lock up huge amounts of if its own money. Where are they going to get that money?

> What economic behavior do you need to test for something like this?

Let's say I want to send $2 to the coffee merchant using LN through the hub. If this is the first time the coffee merchant receives money through LN the hub would have to open a channel to them. The hub can't use my $2 in that channel because those are still locked up in my channel. So they would have to pay those $2 themselves. But it only makes sense to open a payment channel if you can use it many times, so It should probably contain at least $100-$1000. So now, because of my $2 payment, the hub is required to lock up $100 of its own money in a payment channel for the coffee merchant. This just doesn't make economic sense to me.

In addition, the hub would need to constantly create new transactions automatically, so all the private keys need to be in a hot wallet exposed to the internet.

"> A hub would have to lock up huge amounts of if its own money. Where are they going to get that money?

The same way every other business gets investment, I'd guess? The exchanges could probably open some hubs, BitPay a few others as well.

They would only have to lock up an amount equivalent to their throughput plus a healthy margin for usage spikes.

>  The hub can't use my $2 in that channel because those are still locked up in my channel. So they would have to pay those $2 themselves.

Yes

> So now, because of my $2 payment, the hub is required to lock up $100 of its own money in a payment channel for the coffee merchant.

But those $100 aren't locked up just for you, they can serve any of their other customers. So really they only have to lock up an amount similar to the transaction throughput they see.

> In addition, the hub would need to constantly create new transactions automatically, so all the private keys need to be in a hot wallet exposed to the internet.

"> Yes! Competent exchanges keep 95-99% of the coins they manage in cold storage.

Yes, but it's the exact same idea, a hub can also keep most of their buffer in cold storage when the usage is low and bring it out when needed. Over time this can get more efficient as they learn the usage patterns of their users.

> If the fees are too high, the whole thing becomes pointless. See how you can't test this on testnet?

Fair point, but I don't think the risk is as high as you think to warrant very high fees. But you're right, we'll need to wait to know for sure.

There's already an android LN wallet for the Bitcoin testnet and it's great for coffee purchases and such, it's instantaneous (~1sec) and completely secure!

It's called eclair wallet, PM me your address if you want some testnet Bitcoin's, you can then try LN transactions at the demo site 'starblocks'. 

It currently only allows payment via LN, not receiving, because for receiving to be secure you need to have the wallet periodically monitor the blockchain.

Next difficulty adjustment it will skyrocket and it will be more profitable to mine btc, everyone switches back and then BCC has s slow network for the next cycle.

"More revenue is not the same as more profit. An example with fake numbers:

Let's say for $2,000 you can either mine 1 BTC or 10 BCC.

Let's say 1 BTC is $4,000 and 1 BCC is $1,000.

So for the cost of mining 1 BTC you can mine 2.5 BTC worth of BCC.

That's 150% more. But for the profit you need to subtract the cost.

Mining BTC you would have $4,000 - $2,000 = $2,000 profit.

And mining BCC you would have $10,000 - $2,000 = $8,000 profit.

"**Bloom filter: Algorithm description**

An empty Bloom filter is a bit array of m bits, all set to 0. There must also be k different hash functions defined, each of which maps or hashes some set element to one of the m array positions, generating a uniform random distribution. Typically, k is a constant, much smaller than m, which is proportional to the number of elements to be added; the precise choice of k and the constant of proportionality of m are determined by the intended false positive rate of the filter. To add an element, feed it to each of the k hash functions to get k array positions.

"It's generally considered bad form to ask someone's thoughts about an article without linking to it. Are you talking about [this article](https://www.coindesk.com/spv-support-billion-bitcoin-users-sizing-scaling-claim/) on scaling SPV to a billion users? That article is based on the premise that you need to read the block from disk once for every SPV client that wants to filter the block for transactions matching his addresses, which concludes that bandwidth is the critical property rather than storage. That assumption is false in several ways.

For one thing, you can cache part of the blockchain in RAM. Different nodes could advertise different parts of the blockchain that they have stored in RAM, and SPV nodes could connect to multiple servers and get their filtered blocks from them in parallel. It would even be possible to have a front-end node that receives requests from SPV wallets and then dispatches them to a cluster of back-end servers based on which block they depend upon.

Secondly, you can index the blockchain by address upon download, so that when an SPV wallet queries you for transactions matching a certain address or addresses, you can just read your address:transaction map database instead of the blockchain. This is the approach currently taken by the Bitpay/Copay wallet server and Electrum, IIRC.

Thirdly, you can serve multiple SPV wallets with the same disk read. Ultimately, the SPV block filtering process is checking an address's hash against a bloom filter. For this process, you take an address, hash it in [a special way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter#Algorithm_description) to produce a bitstring that is mostly zeros, then AND it against a bloom filter that is also a bitstring that is mostly zeros. If all of the ones from the transaction's bloom hash match the ones in the bloom filter, then the transaction is a match and you send it to the client. Almost all of the work there is in reading the transaction from disk, extracting the addresses, and computing the bloom hash of the transaction; very little computation is done in the bitwise AND against the bloom filter. It would make a lot of sense to compare against several different bloom filters at the same time. A full node could do batch processing of SPV requests, and could process around 100 bloom filters or more on a single block with a single CPU core in the same time as it takes to do 1 bloom filter, or 10,000+ bloom filters on a single block with a single GPU in the same amount of time.

So no, it doesn't require sophisticated hard drive management. It just requires not being dumb about your algorithm, and making a few straightforward optimizations as you scale the system to 1 billion users.";2;1;False;jtoomim;dlw3il0;First 8MB block mined, with nearly 40,000 transactions;6u1jqt;https://blockchair.com/bitcoin-cash/block/479469

"SSDs are overkill for storing the actual blocks. SSDs are useful for storing the UTXO database, but that's about 1/20th the size of the full blockchain. But whatever.

SSDs currently cost around $300 per TB, or $0.30 per GB. Repeating the calc with $0.30/GB gives around 0.3 cents per transaction for storage costs, so his 1 cent per transaction figure is still accurate within rounding error.

Given that you can get a 3 TB HDD for $60 nowadays, you could also argue that $0.02/GB is more accurate. Ultimately, pruning means that the calculation is inherently inaccurate, as only the storage costs for the UTXO database matter.

> My question being 5 cents per GB holds up today for what size blocks? 2MB? 8MB?

Price per GB is independent of block size. (More accurately, price per GB asymptotes at the stated figures as block size increases. If you're only using 1 byte of storage, that byte will be very expensive due to the lack of economies of scale. However, even with 1 MB blocks, we have a blockchain of around 200 GB, which is enough to get close to that asymptote.)";2;1;False;jtoomim;dlvbzcn;First 8MB block mined, with nearly 40,000 transactions;6u1jqt;https://blockchair.com/bitcoin-cash/block/479469
