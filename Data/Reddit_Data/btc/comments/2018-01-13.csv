I bought some (many thousands) a few years ago and then basically learned about them right away and then sold for what I bought in for.  I kinda wish I didn't sell them because I paid essentially nothing and coulda made quite a bit off it, but I sold out of principle.  I'll never own them again even if there is a chance they will go up.  There are plenty of coins that aren't doing stuff like they are and still have a lot of upward potential. ;2;0;False;liquidify;dslgmou;An appeal to the thief that stole my cryptocurrency;7poga6;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7poga6/an_appeal_to_the_thief_that_stole_my/

"You're right, math must be hard for you.

Please, as an exercise, calculate how many more transactions can go in an 8mb block than can in a 1mb block with segwit. Then increase your calculations to see how many go in a 32mb block (which is the limit coded into BCH, 8mb is a soft limit easily removed). Then calculate how much later fees will rise on those larger block sizes, using an average of the rise of fees from BTC on their 1mb block ,extrapolated out to 8 then 32mb.

Your solution, if correct, will show that your statement that BCH fees will moon before currency is false.

Bitcoin Core was the original Bitcoin node client, designed by Satoshi to be the reference client.

In mid-2010, Satoshi had handed control of the git repository over to Gavin Andresen.

"BTC supporter, here, who still thinks BTC can work. As mentioned in a comment above, BCH provides a simple solution to a complex problem. This, to me, signals one of three situations:

* The BCH team are geniuses who have discovered and implemented an elegant solution
* The BCH team are morons who don't understand the problem, or
* The BCH team are scam artists trying to profit off convincing morons who don't understand the problem that they are geniuses who have discovered and implemented an elegant solution.

Unfortunately, based on my own observations, the most favorable of those options does not seem, to me, to be the most likely.

*However,* I'm more than willing to extend the benefit of doubt toward BCH, the team, and supporters. My experiences are subjective and biased. I could be wrong. It's very possible that there's some brilliance to BCH that I'm missing, perhaps buried under the horrendous signal-to-noise ratio.

You're very reasonable. For me, Bitcoin success is betting on the success of Lighting Network. In order for LN to be success, beside putting the money up to be spent, everybody requires to run a hub (or at least has someone to manage the money for them). This gonna be harder than requires everyone to run a SPV node. In the best case scenario, it could takes 2-3 years for LN to have enough hubs to see to good side of it. It's possibly too late at that time. And LN is open-source, everybody can copy it to their coins.;3;0;False;xd1gital;dsm187e;Half of the posts on the front page are bitcoin bashing posts.

"BTC is shedding its network advantage. The network advantage is built and sustained by it being a transactable currency. You can't afford to use it like that for anything but large value transactions now. You build a community for a currency by showing how useful and cool it can be. BTC users used to transfer small amounts of cash such as $1 worth of BTC to their friends to get them interested in using the technology. Now BTC users are priced right out of that and BCH users are not. That's why BCH is better positioned to form a network.

">When I got into Bitcoin, I also looked into BCH but all I saw were people bashing Bitcoin, the community felt angry and hateful, almost fearful that if they didn't bash Bitcoin enough BCH will fail. Doesn't look good to new investors. Just look at the front 2 pages of r/btc, 95% of the posts are bashing Bitcoin.

It goes both ways. I see at least as many people polemically talking about ""BCash"" and how it's a scam run by Roger Ver and Jihan Wu as I see people bashing Core and Blockstream. Both subs are constantly bashing each other. 

But it should be said that one of the best narratives for why BCH is a good blockchain is that BCH's model for how the blockchain should work has been tried and tested for 7 years and has worked great. BTC's radically divergent model with full blocks, slow fees and high transaction times as a feature by contrast has worked absolutely abysmally and has led to a terrible useer-experience. I think if you were a company that makes roads, and your main competition considered it a point of pride that they designed and built 1 lane highways to be used in some of the most highly trafficked parts of the country, it's just a missed opportunity not to point out that unlike them you make highways with enough lanes to prevent congestion.

>Then I really researched BCH and the Coinbase fiasco, the constant manipulation and deceptive tactics used by BCH to confuse new users, wanting to change the name of BCH to Bitcoin, etc. This isn't a good marketing tactic in any business.

I cannot for the life of me imagine how the ""BCH and Coinbase fiasco"" is a black mark on BCH. What's the narrative there?

"> Doesn't look good to new investors.

This is key. Many of us do not think of bitcoin as an investment first with its utility being a side effect. Many of us came to bitcoin because of its utility thinking its increase in value would be a happy side effect. Obviously investor money has come in faster than merchant adoption and that has hampered its utility and its value. Long ago when I discovered reddit and the bitcoin sub I read all the talk about the evil chinese miners trying to corner the market and I worried about 51% attacks and all the other FUD that I read there. But then suddenly Gavin and Mike were pushed out.. the people most responsible for bitcoins success IMO and that gave me great pause. But it was ok because core was just one team and having multiple teams and clients was what bitcoin was all about. But then the sub started to talk about how other clients were evil and other teams were trying to destroy bitcoin and I was very confused. I made a post in the bitcoin sub asking some honest questions about bitcoin XT and it was deleted. You are only allowed to talk about the core team (and approved) work. That was not the bitcoin I signed up. Only then like many refugees did I find r/btc. People here are more bashing the core team than they are bashing bitcoin itself. That is the whole crux of this situation. We LOVE bitcoin. We love it for so many different reasons than moon lambos (not implying that is all you care about). We fell in love with the promise of a world changing financial system free of banks and governments and paypal fees. We saw a small group of people take that dream and strangle it and a lot of us do not understand how such a thing could happen. 

I can not stress enough that I think you should change your perspective of ""r/btc is bashing bitcoin"" to ""r/btc is distraught over the changes and direction the core team has taken bitcoin"".

"I only hold bch now, but I was into writing bots for a while and I liked having crypto pairs instead of Fiat pairs. I'll give my perspective on why this trading pair is significant.

Various coins tend to stay within certain ratios with one another. For instance, if ltc was averaging .01 with BTC, then it was good to buy ltc with btc when the ratio got down to something like .006. Once the ratio moves the other direction to something like .02 it was a good time to trade back, buying BTC with ltc. After every trade back to BTC you are holding more BTC than before. 

If instead I had traded for dollars, both BTC and ltc could go up in price together, which they often did, and I would have lost money by sitting on the sidelines.

I have stopped trading after bch came out. Imagine missing the jump from $300 to $2500 because you traded for ltc or btc. I won't risk that type of loss.

But tons of bots still trade like that, so I see the bch/btc pair as significant even though I personally would not trade on it.";1;0;False;0x760xa9;dsm1uns;Coinbase/GDAX opening BCH/BTC pairs on Wednesday;7pxzl2;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7pxzl2/coinbasegdax_opening_bchbtc_pairs_on_wednesday/

"Firstly, your ""way more"" here measures quantity, but not quality: there's a giant difference between 1 refactoring commit and 1 commit that completely changes how Bitcoin works (for example SegWits'), only the second one shapes Bitcoin's governance.

Secondly, your ""objective data"" it's straight up misleading; Chaincode was made from ex Blockstream devs and what you label as ""MIT"" it's actually made of only 3 people all non-academics: 1 person is former Bitcoin lead developer (role entrusted by Satoshi Nakamoto himself) and was kicked out by Blockstream for the cardinal sin of opposing small blocks, 1 person is Wladimir known for being perfectly aligned with every Blockstream's decision, last person is Cory Fields who mostly does refactoring and code optimizations without being involved in Bitcoin politics. The university only funds development and doesn't have any actual researcher involved in active development.

Thirdly, it doesn't matter how many different people contribute if there's a single entity that can freely choose those individuals. Blockstream kicked out of Core every single developer not agreeing with them, there's no debate, no alternative solutions; all decisions are made in Blockstream company, then astroturfed and forced on others: that's centralized (and the worst kind of centralized I add: totalitarianism) development.
