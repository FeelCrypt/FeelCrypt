">It's not that I'm so sure, it's that I've not seen any reliable source to suggest otherwise. 

This is because there is no certainty here, we have to wait to see what the regulators do and say.  So far I've seen one lawyer who likes to tweet on this matter and that appears to be sufficient comfort for the LN believers.  Anyone telling you with certainty what the regulatory status of LN before any regulator has articulated that is SPECULATING.  Of course regulators are not ready to give such a determination because LN is still being built, with a number of things to be resolved before it can be regarded as a real beta.

"I can't find a single commit by Mike in the repo... did he go by an alias or something? 

EDIT: Found some commits, he has very few. I didn't count them but I'm pretty sure it's smaller than 10. Did he ever have write access? I seriously doubt it. If he didn't, then how can he be pushed out? I know he created BitcoinJ, but I assume he was the maintainer so...

As for Gavin, he doesn't have write access anymore yeah. Looking at the repo, he didn't contribute too much in 2013. He stepped down as maintainer in 2014. He offered the role of maintainer to Wladimir van der Laan. The new maintainer is not part of blockstream, and he was pretty much already the maintainer, looking at the commit history.

Here's the announcement from Gavin:

- https://web.archive.org/web/20140407201636/https://bitcoinfoundation.org/blog/?p=677

Wladimir was the one that revoked Gavin's write privileges to the repo, when Gavin said CSW was satoshi, as far as I can tell.

I find it especially suspicious that most people here shit on blockstream but just love Gavin. He straight up said he was going to
the CIA to talk about bitcoin. And then Satoshi is gone.

"> Well, quite obviously, Bitcoin isn't ""destroyed"". 

Bitcoin being an idea and a network identified by PoW nodes, it's obvious that it can't ever be fully ""destroyed"". If the network state is ruined, it can be resurrected. In any case the idea always lives on.

But what you have currently are two visions for Bitcoin that are being vaguely represented by the two competing branches of the chain before the split. These two forks can compete forever if necessary. 

What defines Bitcoin is a whitepaper and who identifies Bitcoin is ultimately the individual as a member of a community. Today we have two (or more) communities making up the original Bitcoin community and because of the systems nature of competing branches, only the final outcome will in hindsight tell us which was ""the real"" Bitcoin. 

Until then, one can be refereed to as Bitcoin Cash and the other Bitcoin or Bitcoin ""Core"" in cases where we want to differentiate.

It's a complicated situation, but at least admitting that is better than thinking it's as easy as the largest community or the largest pool of hashpower being evidence of the ""real"" Bitcoin.

If Bitcoin ""Core"" is ever attacked and corrupted by hashpower, only it's state of network would be temporarily confused. No one in their right mind would bow down to the majority hash at that point. Rather they would do as Satoshi suggested and change the PoW algorithm, so that the network could continue from the last trusted state under the same name.";3;0;False;fruitsofknowledge;e0fepgd;Why Blockstream Destroyed Bitcoin;8po00a;https://youtu.be/0BZoKH-hX_o
"Let's be clear; You can always ""scale"" in any direction as long as you redefine what you are trying to achieve and I think Lightning Network can do just that. But it won't scale _as Bitcoin_. Only in name. 

The Hal Finney plan of ""scaling"" with second layer banks works fine as a temporary replacement, when you still retain the main chain in a usable state. (I'm personally very enthusiastic about testing various second layers) But the quality of the network interconnectivity can't compare, so neither does the quality of holding balance on it or ultimately sending and receiving transactions.

The solution to perceived ""centralization"" in network nodes / miners (that Satoshi strictly disagreed is the case with the current situation or will be the case) is not to to move away from the main chain, but to keep improving the protocol itself.";1;0;False;fruitsofknowledge;e0fduu7;Why Blockstream Destroyed Bitcoin;8po00a;https://youtu.be/0BZoKH-hX_o
