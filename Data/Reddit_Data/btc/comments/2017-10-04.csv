In order for users to be attracted to the network it needs to fulfill use-cases and provide a good user experience. Both of those are a hard sell to users/services when they experience erratic transaction times.  


I've even advocated for BTC to adopt a new difficulty adjustment as it is a pure upgrade.

"The problems with the EDA concern ""adversarial"" behavior.  So debugging is not a matter of analyzing algorithms for ""correctness"".  It's more like proving that there are no effective attacks.  This is (somewhat) akin to proving a crypto algorithm secure.  It is harder than proving a program to be bug free.  (It is not possible to prove that an arbitrary program is bug free, only a limited subset of possible programs can  be proven, and then only if there is a precise definition of correctness.)

The reality is that depite a huge amount of hash power, the value of BCC *is tanking*.  It's hysterical that you think that hashpower magically means the value will shift to a new chain when we have evidence that proves you wrong.

"Sure. But at equilibrium, hashrate should be about proportional to price. So targetting 10 minute blocks but accepting longer blocks without difficulty adjustment might have been reasonable. Have a smooth switchover zone rather than a severe one. Then miners might switch more gradually as profitability flips.

If you just want to tear all the hashrate from Core based on profitability alone, you probably want to tweak things a bit so that it stays about 10% more profitable or something like that rather than just make it easy to mine many blocks for almost no effort. I don't think this is likely the best strategy though. I would say that we need to compete on utility rather than bleeding block rewards so enough hashrate to keep the coin alive and functional would be fine until Core coin kills itself.

"Game theory shows that the winning strategy for reiterating prisoner's dilemma is to tit-for-tat (First cooperate, then reciprocate).  This reaches Nash equilibrium because you both know that cooperation is more beneficial mutual strategy than to both cheat. Trying to out cheat the other increases the risk and eventually just leads to both cheating.

It is actually a bit more nuanced though and I don't want to go into too much detail. When you have a population of individuals, the winning strategy of prisoner's dilemma, there are two very successful strategies. The first is to cheat always.  The second strategy is tit-for-tat (Cooperate with other cooperators and cheat with other cheaters).  Which strategy is more successful is dependent on the proportion of the population that is pursuing each strategy.  In a population of mostly tit-for-tat, the cheaters won't do well.  In a population of mostly cheaters, the tit-for-tat won't do well.

"The thing about new EDA, is that original Bitcoin EDA works well since its the only coin with the same hash function.  However, having multiple coins with same hash function opens up what you are describing ""game theory"" was for miners to game the system.

The current EDA dilemma isn't caused by miners gaming the system, its simply them switching chains to what is more profitable, but it causes wild swings because its very difficult for the miners to adjust manually, otherwise there are other factors like price (which is now dropping).

But from the overview of his algorithm, it seems pretty solid.

"> RIght now we're chasing users and capital away with unpredictable block times and misaligned incentives.

How true is this, though? There's very little activity on Bitcoin Cash chain right now. For example, I don't even notice any variations in block times. So, some tx might take a bit longer, big deal...

This problem will auto-solve itself when Bitcoin Cash becomes more popular at the expense of the legacy chain. It could be argued that unstable block times make it harder for Bitcoin Cash to become more popular, but without any tangible data it's just a speculation.

I think the reason Satoshi picked that particular algorithm is precisely because any faster-reacting algorithm can be gamed. And the more complex it is, the harder it is to analyse and see the ways it can be gamed.

Isn't mining profitability independent of block times.

So miner profitability is purely based on your efficiency relative to the current difficulty. This is under the assumption that the price remains constant.

"It needs to adjust the difficulty upwards slowly when more hash power arrives on BCH.

But remember we are competing against Bitcoin Legacy chain for hash rate. Miners switch when it's more profitable to mine. Every time the EDA kicks in we take a large chunk of hash rate from the legacy chain. Their chain slows down and the mempool blocks up. This has CoreStream very worried that miners are leaving their chain. It's a gradual flippening. More hash rate arrives each time this happens. This is how Bitcoin Cash kills off the legacy coin.

The inflation is only temporary. Remember there's still only 21 million coins ever. All these blocks being mined quickly means we will reach the next block reward halvening more quickly. This means more scarcity and a higher price. At the moment the extra liquidity is good for the coin. This is a currency remember. There needs to be enough of it for people to spend and buy things. Users are still trying to figure out how to retrieve their Bitcoin Cash after the fork. It's pretty complicated. A bunch of it is also locked up in places like Coinbase etc. So there's only so much available right now.

Contrast this with the legacy chain with so many people ""hodling"" their coins. This creates artificial deflation. It's like an ongoing ponzi scheme. Price goes up to 5K. People sell and it tanks to 3700. Then they buy in again at the low point and do it all over again. There's no way a real currency can handle such huge swings. One day you can buy 5 computers with your Bitcoin, next day only 3. People need to use it as a currency for it to grow. Sure hold one or two coins as saving or investment, but spend to get Bitcoin working and growing. The more people that spend and use, the more merchants support it. Then it becomes more widely used and a world currency. Then we fire the banksters and governments with their money printing schemes and inflationary fiat which means money never holds its value and entire generations are enslaved in debt, generation Y and Z can't buy houses or get a university education without huge debt.";2;3;False;BgdAz6e9wtFl1Co3;dnw6emq;I think we need an EDA fix before the Nov hardfork;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7474tv/i_think_we_need_an_eda_fix_before_the_nov_hardfork/

"This is my reply on the post you linked to re: inflation on BCH:
___
It's not that hard to do the math actually.

According to cash.coin.dance there have been 3992 more blocks mined on the Cash chain than the Legacy chain.  At 12.5 BCH/block that's 49900 extra BCHs mined in the last ~60 days.

Or you can go to coinmarketcap.com, it shows BCH 16,653,338 and BTC 16,603,525 for a difference of 49813.  Same story.

49813 coins in 63 days since the fork means 830 bch/day are being mined in addition to the 1800 coins expected.

1800 coins/day (normal expected BTC output) represents 4% inflation.  2630 BCH/day represents 5.84% inflation, which is **46% higher inflation** than the expected 4% inflation.  Burning through the remaining coins 46% faster than expected is **not insignificant.**

I think this is not good.  Moreover the wild swings in block output is not conducive to a good user experience, and probably affect security negatively as well.  It needs to be addressed, sooner not later.

I don't think anyone on the core side is particularly worried. Perhaps in the beginning but the btc difficulty has averaged itself out so it even kind of takes into account the hash rate temporarilt dropping now and then.

I think it could be done. Bitcoin's difficult adjustment algorithm is fairly unsophisticated and could be countered with a more sophisticated algorithm and if some compromises were accepted (targeting a 10 minute block time at this stage was both unwise and unneeded).;2;1;False;Richy_T;dnwcc2i;I think we need an EDA fix before the Nov hardfork;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7474tv/i_think_we_need_an_eda_fix_before_the_nov_hardfork/
