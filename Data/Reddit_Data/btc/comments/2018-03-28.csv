"Does it work? Yeah, let's assume it does (there are still a few hurdles)

Is it practical to do everything on the public ledger? Not really. There are a handful of uses that benefit greatly by moving off-chain and only settling on occasion to the blockchain. (Such as a pay-per-minute smart contract that signs a small value transfer hundreds of times per day)

I look forward to the day when multiple approaches can be combined for the ultimate currency. (Bigblocks, LN, sidechains, ethereum-style contracts, blended pow/pos, etcetera).

"My second paragraph is about keeping safe from fraud, not performing transactions.

LN is an instant micropaymet system, it's designed so that you can purchase cheap services and goods instantly and securely. Your client opens channels to nodes with good uptime and good, cheap connections and fees.

Running an LN node doesn't make you centralized. I can run one from my home internet connection and a low powered computer easily.
Centralization is a spectrum, not a binary. LNs are slightly more centralized than regular bitcoin but very much less centralized than exchanges, web wallets, bitcoin payment services or any type of fiat payment processor.
