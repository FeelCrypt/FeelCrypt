"Yah my main goal with that was to point out that there were ways to explain how Tether worked other than OMG Conspiracy / Fractional Reserve etc... I'm not affiliated with Tether or a sycophant of Bitfinex in any way.

The audit news is troubling though it was known about for a while before just today. It's true that Tether supply did blow up towards the end of the year but that also corresponded with many more large exchanges accepting Tether. If you look at the Tether rich list now its littered with exchanges that were not there even 3 months ago. 

I have to say that the audit getting canceled really does not look good and combined with the CFTC subpoena things definitely don't look good so we will see how that plays out. The thing that lingers in the back of my mind is that the owner of Bitfinex are making soooooo much money running that exchange I don't see why they would risk blowing it all up by going fractional reserve with Tether, really for no reason. 

One very interesting development that just happened within the hour is that Bitfinex sent 200M Tether BACK to the Treasury wallet as you can see here http://omniexplorer.info/lookupadd.aspx?address=1NTMakcgVwQpMdGxRQnFKyb3G1FAJysSfz . This is the first time this really has ever happened. Its effectively a ""reduction in supply"", but it wont actually become official until that Tether gets burned. Regardless I see this as them sending a signal that Tether can actually work the way it was intended to work i.e. people can cash out.

I've often spent around 10 cents for litecoin or more (sometimes less).. and 1 cent (or under 1 cent) for BCH.  It depends on inputs/outputs and current price of course, but I use both, ideally the cheapest at any given time.  BCH is always cheaper for me as far as I've been able to tell, 0-1 sat/byte is hard to beat (even on a good sized transaction, that's less than half a cent right now.)  On ETH I'm around 2 cents (still beating litecoin) at a gas price of 2 gwei.
