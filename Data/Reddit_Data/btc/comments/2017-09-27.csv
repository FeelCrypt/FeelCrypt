"Experts Conclude TweetStream's SegTxt™© Technology Is Decentralized And Superior, And It's Got Electrolytes!

John Smith and Bob Jones, both total experts in the field, have completed their highly technical research into Twitter's current character limits.  They discovered that you won't like the very bad people who want to increase the character limit.  

""They're clearly trying to take over decentralized Twitter,"" says John Smith, the new CTO of Brickdream, Inc, the open source decentralized team of developers that invented Bitfoil, the future successor to Bitcoin.  ""These people who want to raise the character limit are racists,"" he continues.  ""As a developer I read code all day.  Also, as stated above, I am a total expert - put your camera on these papers that prove it.  Bob and I have evaluated the proposal to increase character limit veryh carefully.  We discovered the racists' code to be homophobic as well, and also anti-semitic, and, well, that's where we draw the line.  We cannot allow such an increased character limit in our society and have decided to get on our knees in protest of the Twitter dictatorship.""

TweetStream's SegTxt™© Technology on the other hand, is designed for the Electrolyte Network.  Electrolytes cannot possibly be racist or homophobic.  Most importantly, they can't be anti-semitic either.  Bob Jones has published a great deal of research pertaining to Electrolytes.  ""Only the Electrolyte Network will allow Twitter to scale in a decentralized fashion.  And only we've got it,"" Jones concludes in his groundbreaking research report, titled It's Got Electrolytes, Brought To You By Carl's Jr.
