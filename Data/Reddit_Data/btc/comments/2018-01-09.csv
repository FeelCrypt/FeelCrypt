"Extremely late reply, but I took you up on that offer to see what /rbitcoin has to say. I am posting this reply here in case anyone stumbles upon it. If anyone finds this then do our own research and I'm sure you will come to a reasonable conclusion. Below is a dm I sent to this user - a recollection of the things I've learned since a month ago:

>You probably don't remember, but we had a little conversation here:

>https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7eil12/evidence_that_the_mods_of_rbitcoin_may_have_been/dq7vyqe/

>I'm not sure the exact place our conversation ended but it sparked in me a journey to learn more about the underworkings of Bitcoin. As a result, I have come to the conclusion that both BitcoinCore and BitcoinCash have a place here. I no longer feel that Core is intentionally hurting Bitcoin but rather that their dreams are harder to realize than previously thought. Seeing how we have so many centralized/premined currencies actually doing well I see the danger of a future with establishment taking control of Crypto. As a result I see the usefulness and requirement of Core's need to stay decentralized AND scale well. I know we have offchain ideas which may be monetized but i leaves the ability to stay decentralized and possible scaling improvements down the road.

>I also think that Cash is being led by people who truly believed in a p2p, fast, (insert all other adjectives of crypto), currency for the masses. Core just didn't work out and had to split.

>Maybe I'm just looking at the best possible scenario without human greed and stuff but it makes sense to me.

>I am still learning more about Bitcoin but seeing as how we have other incredible ideas among us in the form of potential altcoins I am not sure if I will ever feel like I have done enough research. I only started looking up Iota last night, and the idea behind Tangle (as opposed to Blockchain) is mind blowing.

>Anyways, it's getting long now. Just wanted to thank you for not dismissing me back then and having a legit conversation despite differences in belief.

Here's the line that started this whole line of discussion:

>Just saying ""but lightning"" **whilst letting bitcoin become unusable** is not adapting to anything.

""letting bitcoin become unusable"" is not the same thing as bitcoin already being completely unusable, although you could just ignore that's what I said and focus on the times I called it unusable as a shorthand because its quicker than writing out ""becoming unusable"" every time. After all what I actually mean is less important to the discussion than what you say I mean.

You can also continue to pretend that usability is binary and that either bitcoin is useful or useless and you can't describe a 40% reduction in the number of top 500 US retailers accepting bitcoin related payments as bitcoin becoming less useful.

I'm not sure what you'll get out of that but you're clearly getting something out of it so do continue.

>You understand that your own source disproves your assertion that it is “useless” as a payment method with merchants, right?

0 of those places actually accept bitcoin.

They accept a service like Bitpay that transfers fiat, not bitcoin.

>Anything which is being used is by definition not useless, even if used only once.

I already acknowledged bitcoin is useful for speculation, I don't know why you keep pretending that I'm not specifically talking about use of currency, and like there's no difference between the two concepts. There's just ""usefulness"" and its impossible to be any more specific than that.

>Trades made on exchanges do not get confirmed on the blockchain.

How do you think people buy/sell bitcoins and get them transferred to a wallet/address?

Every exchange just has every possible amount of bitcoin sitting in a wallet and hands you the keys to them? How did the right amount of bitcoin get into the wallet in the first place without a blockchain transaction?

It's all off chain? What would even be the point of using the blockchain is you can securely transfer millions in bitcoin without transferring on blockchain? That just means you're paying higher fees. High fees and times have decreased the number of merchants accepting bitcoin, but not the number of people using them to buy goods and services? That's why daily transactions are still going up?

$20 fee and 12 hour wait would be crippling for actual purchases of goods and services. It's only viable if you're buying/selling thousands of dollars of bitcoin in which case its only a small percentage and you don't mind if it takes a couple days to confirm.


>Literally every single one of the 358,520 transactions in the last 24 hours were transfers from one bitcoin wallet to another bitcoin wallet

">Not being accepted by merchants does not equal not being used at all. You wouldn't say that gold is useless because merchants don't accept it. 

It's useless as a currency. Try going into a store with a gold coin or certificate and buy something with it. It doesn't matter how much you talk about ""but its a great store of value! why would you want dollars that just go down in value?"", no one wants to spend gold coins which means no one is interested in accepting them. The majority of demand for gold comes from the jewelry and electronics industry. The idea its valuable just because its a ""store of value"" is a myth. Platinum is far rarer than gold, but its less valuable because far less people want platinum jewelry than gold jewelry so the fact its rarer doesn't mean shit. 

The fact that billions of dollars of gold are traded every day does not make it a useful currency. How much gold is traded is completely separate from how useful it is as a currency.

>Can you show us these metrics?

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-12/bitcoin-acceptance-among-retailers-is-low-and-getting-lower

In 2014, 5 out of the top 500 US retailers accepted a form of bitcoin payment (none actually accepted bitcoin, they accepted things like BitPay which transfer fiat, not bitcoin, but lets ignore that for now), today its 3 out of the top 500 retailers.

You can google black markets yourself and see how few are still using bitcoin and how many have switched to other cryptocurrencies.

>Not being accepted by merchants does not equal not being used at all.

How do you think increased transactions are a result of more people using bitcoin to buy goods and services if the number of merchants accepting bitcoin for goods and services is decreasing? Do you think more and more people are just shopping at fewer and fewer stores? If there's such demand for buying things with bitcoin why is the number of merchants accepting it decreasing instead of increasing? Do they just hate making money?

>You wouldn't say that cheeseburgers are useless because merchants don't accept it

I'd say they're useless as a currency, because no one wants to accept a cheeseburger as currency. If you want to talk about how useful it is as food, that's a separate discussion.

>A currency settles debts. Period. That's what it is.

You can settle debts in things other than currency. If you have no money, debt collectors will accept goods and assets instead.

You've already identified what currency use looks like (buying an apple with a dogecoin), I don't know why you keep trying to define it as something that is not specific to currency. You can burn money, does that mean anything you can burn is also money?

Yeah, I know the history, but what parts are you claiming to be an attack?

I sort of agree that the censorship by Theymos on r/bitcoin can be considered an attack. But even if it's done with malice (I don't think it is, I think he's just very biased with his moderation and considers lots of stuff to be trolling) it's quite a minor attack, there are plenty of alternative places to discuss not controlled by him (such as r/btc). 

But Blockstream hiring people to work on a FOSS project isn't an attack. I mean, what would the attack even be if anyone can fork the code? If people don't use alternative clients (and we're talking about the Core client, which isn't used by non-technical users) that's their decision
And you can't force people to work on what you want. If Bitcoin can't survive that, it has no hope.

Both false.

LN introduces significant counterparty risk not present in onchain Bitcoin.  I've explained this elsewhere in this thread.  It also will significantly reduce fees from the base layer.

"Well yeah its great that we have competition and freedom.  But some of these ledgers were not meant to be money.  For example ETH's goal was never really to be money, but instead I think they are trying to achieve a ""world computer"", and ETH is just kind of like the fuel.  They have not even decided the inflation schedule on ETH from my understanding.  A few central entities might hold a lot of influence on how to create more ETH, and it could slip into oligarchy, similar to our legacy banking system.  With Bitcoin its a lot harder, since the ledger and code caps the coins at 21 million.  Even if there were inflationary forks down the line, it would be decided by the free market in a decentralized way without central planners, which is a lot more healthy.

Some economists have criticized crypto as being not a sound money, since anyone can create their own out of thin air, then we have thousands of currencies.  But having the power of one super ledger, and one widely used global money has huge advantages, and I think the market will coalesce mostly on one major currency which will account for like 90% of all market cap.

"Bitcoin Legacy is not a store of value because it lacks utility.  You could argue it has a very tiny amount of utility with the giant fees and slow confirms.  The network effect and Metaclfe's Law and the fact that a lot of people were using Bitcoin Legacy helps give it added utility. The more people on a network to connect to, the more valuable it is. But As I linked Falkvinge's post, this is short lived with $30 fees.

You switched to ETH, which seems not a bad idea compared to segwitcoins.  But I would challenge you to consider Metcalfe's Law and the power of one ledger and the network effect.

Its also why [I was able to even predict BCH before is existed](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/68jja0/dont_forget_money_and_bitcoin_are_just_a_ledger/dgyysp0/).

So sure Bitcoin Legacy will always have some tiny amount of utility.  Kind of like the restaurant is always crowded so nobody goes there anymore.  But if the network effect on the ledger is to continue and go world wide, we will need a fork of the ledger, and that fork is Bitcoin Cash.  BCH is becoming solidified as the only Bitcoin Ledger option more and more everyday.  Even if Core tried raising blocksize now I don't think it can stop the BCH momentum.";1;1;False;cryptorebel;dsfkrz7;If it’s inaccessible to the poor it’s neither radical nor revolutionary.;7owwoi;https://i.redd.it/sztrnwf9os801.jpg

"Well thanks for arguing the point at least. I agree you can't have a store of wealth without utility but that's circular reasoning, bitcoin can't be a store of wealth because it has no utility and it has no utility because it's not a currency and not a store of wealth. You didn't actually prove the point that bitcoin has no utility that is still in contention. 

Mises regression theorem is just a way to prove why people exchange their goods and services for money instead of buying things directly with theirs goods and services. Why is there a middle man ? The theorem concerns itself with MARGINAL utility, the extra utility we get from money compared to the stuff we exchange for it (work for most people). 

It's more useful to me to work for money than try to trade my work for each thing I need, food, shelter, etc. That's all it says. I don't know where in there you found a justification for Bitcoin not having utility. If the people currently holding Bitcoin didn't consider it useful to them they would sell it, thus the argument is void. 

As for the argument that BTC isn't for poor people therefore it's shooting itself in the foot: totally 100% agree. 30$ fees are non sustainable. I personally divested from bitcoin and moved into Ethereum for this reason and several others (turing completeness, many ICO's paying into the mining, etc). 

But to say that because bitcoin has wild swings it's not a store of value is just wrong. If people use it as a store of value, this guy looking down on them because of the swings is too big for him to stomach doesn't mean it's not a store of value. In fact, he compares to a Picasso, which is definitely a store of value for every rich person on this planet.

"Exactly, I don't get those people who keep asking and suggesting raising the blocksize on BTC. It has been made perfectly clear that this is not something BTC wants to do. **If you have a different opinion then BTC is not a coin for you, it's that simple!**

It's like people buying XRP and then demanding they get rid of all the banks using it - this is the entire premise of the coin, don't be stupid!

And small blocks + SW + LN is an entire premise of BTC (as it has become), if you believe in that vision hold it, if you do not, sell it! Simple.

If you favor bigger blocks, use BCH instead of BTC, the visions have clearly separated - make up your mind and hold the one you believe in.";164;13;False;mushner;dsf4dgn;"Please stop saying ""Increase the block size""";7p7sxc;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7p7sxc/please_stop_saying_increase_the_block_size/

"I'm not ""telling him to have certain opinion.""  That's an unfair mischaracterization.

The problem is that every goddamn day my friend (who I really want to like) is just going on and on about this fucking problem he has with Pepsi not tasting more like Coke, and frankly, I get tired of him ranting endlessly about this ""problem"" of his, when he *could* just STFU and drink Cokes instead.  Apparently it's some huge hang up for him to be associated with the ""coke"" brand because he's just fixated on this ""Pepsi"" mantra.
 
So I'm not telling him what opinion to have, I'm explaining why his complaining isn't likely to get him anywhere since Pepsi drinkers actually LOVE Pepsi, and I'm suggesting that he quit complaining all the time and just drink a cola that tastes like what he keeps saying he wants.

"Should primary developers be prohibited from working for money? Do they have to work for donations, have unrelated side jobs or be independently wealthy for them to be acceptable to you?

Side chains certainly won't ""die immediately"" with a hard fork. The tippr bot works just fine (better even) on BCH's hard forked blockchain!

Hard forks are easy for new coins. They are virtually guaranteed to be progressively harder as economic actors increasingly using the blockchain have competing interests.

Blockstream still has a hard fork on their roadmap, but two important things happened around three years ago. First, the rate of orphaned blocks increased significantly around 250MB per block, causing miners to collapse toward the largest, most profitable pool, i think even driving them briefly over 51% hash rate until they self capped well below that level.

Thin blocks reduced this problem, but they have only increased the size at which it has an economic impact -- at some point, transaction propagation (not block propagation) will be a bottleneck even if blocks are compressed to nothing.

Second, core developers working on segwit to eliminate transaction malleability realized they could do it in a way that would increase block capacity by around 2x.

That was the point that they stopped advocating for a separate block size increase. They had designed a soft fork upgrade that they considered less risky than a hard fork that would need to come before many of the items on the hard fork wish list would be ready.

That's not to say it's impossible that core developers paid by blockstream are working against what they see as the best path forward, instead prioritizing blockstream profits. It's just disingenuous to claim that's the only possible explanation for why things have developed the way they have.";3;3;False;HackerBeeDrone;dsfnm2b;"Please stop saying ""Increase the block size""";7p7sxc;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7p7sxc/please_stop_saying_increase_the_block_size/

In a decentralized system, this value should be set by the participants (miners). Not dictated by a central party or written in the code. Every ten minutes a miner should be able to adjust the blocksize. If they want to deliver more blocksize to the market, then go ahead. If they want to deliver Less, then they can do that too. Users can offer money to be included and to incentivize miners to add their transactions.

We can add examples from the open source world that are similar to what's going on here. The most obvious example is OpenOffice / LibreOffice.

So all open source developers migrated to LO, and it's currently the side that came successful (I'm not sure if OpenOffice is in active development anymore).

For me I realized:

1. The soft fork approach is a coercive and thus unacceptable way to impose contentious change

2. Once it's added it makes future onchain scaling even more politically difficult than it is now (since the max permitted block is ~2X the max expected block)

3. The soft fork approach made Segwit code much harder to work with, fewer people know how to safely code for it, worsening the developer centralization problem

4. There was some limited concern that Segwit degrades the security model (more ""wart"" than ""cancer"" but still)

5. It didn't seem as if it would provide any significant block-size relief, even if it did work as otherwise expected

Then, one day Pepsi got bought by some coprophiles (look it up) who thought that the best way to improve my favorite drink was to add shit to it. Like, literal feces. In a soft drink. It was awful. They called it ""seg-shit"" and *they* said it was the best thing ever. 

Evidently Pepsi wasn't for actually *drinking* more, it was a ""store of value."" The latest theory is that aluminum cans with shit in them are collectible or something (don't ask me, as far as I'm concerned it didn't make any sense).

Whenever anyone pointed out that human feces do not constitute a taste explosion, and maybe should be removed were banned from all Pepsi forums.

Then a group of people got together and called themselves ""Better Pepsi"" and said ""hey, let's try taking out the shit."" 

It's true that if you want to enjoy a beverage without the turds you can now buy a Better Pepsi.

However, For years we were all extolling the virtues of Pepsi, and there's a long web history of all the amazing reasons we really should be drinking Pepsi. People say, ""Hey weren't you really into Pepsi? You told me all about how awesome it is, but when I went to try it, it well, it tasted like shit! What's up with that?"" 

Additionally, squadrons of Financial gurus that have never enjoyed a soft drink (they stick with Perrier and Scotch) discuss the financials of Pepsi regularly without actually seeming to realize or acknowledge that Pepsi's products are made entirely from raw sewage. 

These assholes have made liars out of early adopters, and on top of that they give a long string of reasons why the shit is a *good thing*. Then they get their giant propaganda department to call Better Pepsi ""B.Pee."" and laugh like drunken hyenas about it.

So no, even though I'm now drinking Better Pepsi and enjoying the taste of a soft drink without shit in it, I'm still a bit angry about this.

Given the circumstances, I think that suggesting that maybe -- just maybe -- we shouldn't include shit in soft drinks is not unreasonable.

TLDR; If your company took a great product that I once loved and made it shit, I have every right to criticize that decision even if I have now found a better replacement.

[Further note, in case anyone here suffers from a clinical disorder making them immune to sarcasm and metaphor: Pepsi is an analaogy for Blockstream here. I actually like Pepsi and drink Pepsi regularly. To the best of my knowledge, their products do not include any feces.]

Yes but the current mission of Bitcoin Core (BTC) is to become a settlement layer for L2 transaction layers in which ""any person"" can individually validate the entire chain. Core has been super consistent for years now that this is the strategy and that last bit (that ""anyone"" can validate the chain) has been hammered home again and again.

You have to understand the mission before you can design strategies for improvement.

Since the mission of Bitcoin Core (BTC) is to be ""as easy for anyone to validate as possible"" then things like ""increasing the block size"" and ""lowering the block generation time"" and ""sharding"" are *not* ""improvements"" but *degradations*.

"The Core chain represents the total victory of the Core team over anyone who asked them to do anything or make any compromise that wasn't part of the road-map they envisioned. The failure of Segwit2x was the last of the efforts over a period of 3 years by the Bitcoin community, its users and the businesses that help form its ecosystem, to convince the Core team to make one small compromise, one tiny little compromise by supplying slightly bigger blocks to buy time for layer 2 and Segwit adoption. This was thrown out the window. And here we are.

So I'm not exactly worried that Core is going to wake up and raise the blocksize. They've proven over 3 years that they can do whatever they want with impunity, and what they want and what their users want is misaligned. I am worried though that users who don't know their history don't understand what they're buying when they are buying BTC. when they are buying BTC.

I don't think we have to be afraid for Core raising the blocksize limit. However when people keep asking for that everybody will know something is wrong. I am just trying to get as many people to switch camps. Because eventually enough people will be forced to switch anyway and the congestion on the core chain will go away.

"Yes the fun think about Bitcoin use to be that any developer, even those without money, could have an idea and build on top of Bitcoin. Anything build on top of Bitcoin can be layer 2, when not everything is done on chain. Tippr is  layer 2. Yours is layer 1. Both should always be possible and should be affordable for anybody. Otherwise Bitcoin will start discriminating based upon how much money somebody has. 

Now don't forget that WE  don't have to be maximalists. How many people can dogecoin, Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash together serve before all three of them have a problem and need to ramp it up? Well, the demand needs to come firsts .... it's pointless to say

""hur hur hur, A doest not work because B years from now it's going to have scaling problem so let's stick with C"" 

(but C works even worse then A)

Yeah well, let's just try  .... there will be enough smart people to think a little bit ahead. 

But the base layer that people are going to build upon needs to stay open. I have been asking Core to raise the blocksize for a while know, knowing very well they will never do that because they have to admit defeat first ... which I don't think is humanly possible.
So what is the danger? That bad actors again will try to infiltrate the crypto communities and try to make us all fight each other. 

There for there is not better weapon for us right now to build strong communities where enough people trust each other and where certain handles build up enough reputation that there will aways be enough trust to trust them over bad actors that will come. 
Let's not make the same mistake again, decent politics and leadership is going to be needed. The code and math can work without it but communities simply can not.  People are the weakest link and will always be the cheapest to attack. We have seen how a character assassination on Gavin was attempted. I would not be surprised if Craig Wright is a bad actor. I also trust Eric Voorhees over Roger Ver but Roger is kind of doing an okay job. Then there are the moderators here that are doing a splendid job with standing attack after attack from the bad actors. But those attacks are only going to become worse.  Already I think there is a lot of goodwill between the three big crypto communities, dogecoin, Bitcoin Cash and Ethereum. (it's also nice to have something like shapeshift now)

Let's all put in an afford and hopefully the community is now stronger then 4 years ago and we will be able to move forwards toward more adaptation and a ecosystem with a healthy growth. We will always be fighting from behind because we want crypto to be open and accessible to as many people for as long as possible.

"That's a perfectly reasonable reply, and because that's your position, I doubt you're clamoring for an increase in block size so much as watching how the two strategies play out.

If you're hedging, then you *want* each coin to pursue a *different* strategy.

That didn’t happen. Jeff Garzik proposed increasing the limit in 2010 and published a code snippet that would let nodes do so.

"I would say that Cobra’s apparent change is a perfect comparative example of why this @bitcoin account looks so ridiculously suspect. 

Cobra didn’t just flip over one day and start chanting “BitcoinCash, BitcoinCash, rah rah rah!”. He gradually noted that the sky-rocketing fees were clearly a problem, and that block-size scaling might not be such a bad idea after all. 

By contrast the @bitcoin account has no story arc. No gradual realisation or softening of attitudes. The owner apparently just “woke up” with a sudden overwhelming need to push the “BCH is Bitcoin” narrative a dozen times a day.";3;1;False;tophernator;dsfmh83;"@Bitcoin: ""The ownership of this account has not changed hands.

With twitter names of Brands and such the company can go to twitter and ask them to transfer the name into their control.

"No, it's not really front running.  Front running is a term that goes back to the days of pre-electronic trading where the order books were actual physical things and it was really possible to put your orders in first if you worked at an exchange.   

That's pretty much what frontrunning is -- getting your order in because you have knowledge of some big order that will happen in the future.

And yes, while frontrunning is very serious...

I don't see what happened at coinbase as frontrunning, even.  It's technically possible to do frontrunning on an e-exchange but these days it matters far less.

And let's not forget coinbase is trading commodities (BCH, BTC, ETC, LTC) -- for which the rule are less strict than securities.  Although not unheard of, in general insider trading rules aren't applied to commodities markets.  In fact I think only 1 person ever has been sanctioned for commodity insider trading. 

https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2015/12/04/the-first-insider-trader-in-commodities/

I dunno.  To me this speaks of some ignorant people being ignorant, really.  I'm surprised that the Coinbase CEO took the bait.

I do think in general it's a good policy for Coinbase internally to limit or prohibit its employees trading activities, perhaps.  That's their choice.

But if they do or do not -- even if it feels really unfair -- cryptos are commodities and coinbase is a commodities exchange.

"Whether or not insider trading is stupid is a different question altogether (with interesting arguments on both sides)...

What they did isn't insider trading.  I'm really really surprised the Coinbase CEO doesn't know this.

Now, his own internal policy on trading can be whatever the fuck he wants it to be, fair enough.

But keep your shit in-house.  Yell at your employees or discipline them.  Don't go crying to the press ""insider trading!"" when it isn't.

Makes no sense to me.  Brian Armstrong is a fuckwit sometimes, as much as I love his company.

"""Bitcoin Cash implementation spills Picasso’s painting supplies.

The ‘Picasso’ bot appears to be extremely aggressive in how it trades, this aggressiveness was fully exposed with Coinbase adding Bitcoin Cash to their exchange.

This bot, within minutes, drove the price of Bitcoin Cash to 200+% higher than the rest of the market, due to the order books being practically empty, only stopping with another giant ask wall (which also could have been the Picasso bot).


$20 bucks says the buy orders and sell orders belong to the same person.
I believe that the reason we saw Bitcoin Cash start out trading like this, several hundred percent higher than the rest of the market, is because the tape painting bot was unleashed on this trading pair too early.

With empty orderbooks, within minutes it drove the price to as high as $9,500. It was so bad that Coinbase had to suspend trading, interestingly, they also suspended trading on December 7th, 2017 when this bot went wild as well, driving Bitcoin prices thousands of dollars ahead of the rest of the market.

Notice how there is a buy order for 95 Bitcoin Cash at $8500. No human being would have entered this order on GDAX. This was a tape painting bot specifically designed to inflate prices.

Coinbase should investigate the account which placed these buy orders, because in my opinion they were not bona-fide orders made by a trader but by a bot trying to manipulate prices, which is a violation of Coinbases Term’s of Service.


This bot has also caused them an extraordinary amount of PR damage and accusations of possible insider trading.""

"The thing that I don't get is coinbase employees buying BCH does not fit the definition of insider trading.  

Insider trading would be if the coinbase employees bought/sold COINBASE stock, not BCH, which is a third party commodity (as defined by US law).  US law treats cryptos as commodities and/or property, not securities.  Why doesn't the coinbase CEO get this before being an alarmist?

I get that he has to chastise his own employess for violating their own internal policy -- but what the employees did is not illegal.  He should have kept his shit in-house and not announced to the world that Coinbase employees were doing insider trading (they weren't as far as the rest of the world outside of coinbase is concerned).

It makes no sense to me that they would cry ""insider trading"" thus throwing some shade on all cryptos.  We already suffer from a slight image problem with the mainstream -- this did not help.

"False, everybody could have placed sell orders of their BCH, credited to them after the fork, way before the market opened.

Liquidity was shit because no one wanted to sell their BCH.

Those 3 minutes didn't reflect, obviously, but because bots elsewhere didn't have the time to synchronize with that API since it went down with the frozen price but zero volume. Every time something like this happens the price crashes.

Maybe you also think that it was the conspirators and picasso bots that drove the price to the moon in bithumb and bittrex and elsewhere after segwit2x cancellation.

Insider trading is a misnomer. It is more akin to front running which is equally prohibited. At its core employees had price sensitive information that was not public and thus should not be allowed to trade on that market. ;11;2;False;guibs;dsf9xzg;GDAX: Bitcoin Cash Launch Retrospective -- trades were halted after 3 minutes because THE STASH DRIED OUT DUE TO AN AVALANCHE OF BUY ORDERS;7p7evu;https://blog.gdax.com/bitcoin-cash-launch-retrospective-79c2eb7d9175

"What I find most entertaining is the very people crying insider trading are largely those that also screamed that BCH would crash the moment trading opened.  Can't have it both ways, buddy.
