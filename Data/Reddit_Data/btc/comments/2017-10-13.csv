"Yup, so Xthin is at most a 2x reduction in _total_ bandwidth used, which doesn't sound too fancy; but its main advantage is massive, couple-orders-of-magnitudes reduction in _burst_ bandwidth required to ensure the network doesn't fall apart.

Yes. But before xthin, nodes would see most transactions twice. Once when they are broadcast to the world, and once when they are included in a block.

Sigh. Why only 2MB ? Segwit2x would allow block sizes that are larger than 2MB (it’s possible to get very close to 8MB) . Scaling on chain is dumb anyway. N tx is still N tx .
