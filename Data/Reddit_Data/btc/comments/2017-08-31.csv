It doesn't seem you have a real argument against what big blockers say, other than the already debunked small blocker bullshit that anyone who has been around before Blockstream knows is absolute garbage.

"If you really think that SegWit wasn't contentious in the slightest, I'm not sure we can even have a conversation as we're not even on the same planet.  I'm glad that it activated, as I think that it was the best path forward(I also support a 2MB base block size increase, however), but to pretend that it was ""universally acclaimed"" and that no dissent was present is just plain dishonest, no other way to say it. 

UASF was basically pointless, to be frank I don't think that many people gave a shit that 4-5% of nodes were going to fork themselves from the network, I certainly didn't.  NYA is what got SegWit activated, not that.  Once again, if you can't see that basic fact, I'm not sure we can have a productive conversation, much in the same way that I can't have a productive conversation with a rabid anti-vaxxer or a flat-earther. We're just too far away to even have much in the way of common ground to stand on. 

Now back to the point of this whole interaction...I'm well aware of the difference between a hard and soft fork(thanks for your condescension, however) you just don't seem to realize(or want to admit, perhaps) that the subreddit rule that you appear to be referencing as justification for deleting my comment doesn't say anything at all about a type of fork.

And that's how I know you are *truly* inhabiting a different reality from mine :) 

>Second, I am obviously not saying that no person that supports big blocks ever said anything untrue

Oh, my bad. So *some* big blockers lie *sometimes*? Cool. So how do I know the difference between when they're lying and when they're telling the truth? 

>I mean the big block narrative, the vision of decentralized peer to peer cash and scaling Bitcoin on chain to reach everyone in the world, liberating billions of people. Big blockers say blocks should be bigger and can scale on chain. What about this belief is false?

It's not that it's *false*, it's that increasing the size of the blocks increases bitcoin's attack surface, making it more likely that some unforeseen attack vector will be exploited. It's *possible* that doubling the block size will not kill bitcoin. But it's a slippery slope that leads to more and more block size increases, causing an ever-growing attack surface, making bitcoin more and more fragile, and increasing the chance of a catastrophic failure.

"Yeah but both sides DON'T use propaganda. Only one side does and then they try to claim the other side does too, to help their cause. The truth is this debate is not technical, but political. One faction wants to scale Bitcoin as is was originally designed, the other faction is trying to crush that, for personal gain. 

The truth though, is that big blockers just tell the truth about what Bitcoin really is and what it is supposed to be. Explaining to people that there is an original design for this thing the differs from the direction the corporation Blockstream is taking it in is not propaganda at all. 

What propaganda Is though, is using fake, made up narratives to persuade people to think or feel one way or another. Few examples of this:

- Small blockers mislead newer users into believing everyone needs to run a node, when in fact, if you read the white paper, you will see the way Bitcoin is designed, is NOT for everyone to run a node. Users who are just transacting should use SPV. Only miners and businesses need nodes. 

- The way they push the narrative that miners are evil and users need to ""take back their power"" from miners. lmao. Oh and the asicboost thing, which has not been proven. 

- The way they lie and say Bitcoin can't scale on chain (even though we have had 3 consecutive block size increases in the past) and that's why we need to choke on chain scaling and push all business onto their centralized L2, there THEY make the fees. 

So you can see small blockers are constantly using lies and propaganda to push the narrative that miners are bad, bitcoin can't scale on chain and increasing the block size is bad. All three of those things are lies. 

So that is what I'm talking about. Small blockers lie about fundamental things to pass an agenda. Big blockers do not. Big blockers simply tell the truth. Having the truth on your side really helps.

"Let's see. I invested in Baidu in 2009 right after the market crashed and the stock split 10:1 about two years later. I was able, for the first time in my life, to pay for a brand-new car with all cash right then and there... bought and paid for off the showroom floor with the gains from that one stock, and still had plenty left over. The last quarter earnings it went up $22/share. That's a lot for common stock. 

Then I discovered BTC in 2011. I'll let you extrapolate on that and how ""broke"" I would be since I'm a HODL'r (I hate that term lol). 

I sold the remainder of my stock in FB, TSLA, and NFLX to reallocate my funds into crypto investments. I bought into these stocks very early on, in their first or second years of existence.

"That is a critical piece of infrastructure. It's a start, but not enough - not on its own. Not with the network over-capacity right now. Most merchants don't accept BTC directly, which sucks, but it is what it is. Without BitPay and Coinbase enabling support for their merchants to get paid via LN, I expect a majority of bitcoin users will view LN as a gimmick with no real world utility. If LN is to be a scaling solution, I really don't understand why LN devs have not been working with payment processors to accelerate adoption of LN. ""Accelerate"" isn't even the right word - ""create"" would be much more apt. For that matter, DNMs should have been reached out to ages ago (even before BitPay/Coinbase) because in cryptodom DNMs are analogous to [porn sites of the early internet](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2002/mar/03/internetnews.observerfocus). As it stands, LN as a real scaling solution is years away (assuming it will even work as advertised. I know LN has been on testnet for ages, but I can't seem to find any evidence that it was properly stress tested. Has any group of people attempted to push LN to 100k tx/sec or more on testnet? If they haven't, why the fuck not? How can LN be a scaling solution that is promised to scale to millions of tx/sec if that kind of scalability has never been demonstrated in practice? If there were documented test runs on testnet of LN with functional real decentralized routing and that kind of scale of transactions per second, instead of calling LN vaporware I would be busy doing my part rallying the community to build out in infrastructure and make it a reality.
