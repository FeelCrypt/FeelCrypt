">  Not my typical MO.

No problem.  I get carried away in /r/btc too.

The answer to most of your questions is that we can't really enforce any of those things.   Everyone is free to pool together as much as they want.  It's up to the community to throw a fit if miners become too centralized.  

CPU mining can only happen if we fork the miners, but at some point an ASIC will be developed.  It's senseless to fight it.   Using simple algorithms accelerates the inevitable process.  The goal is to get to the commoditized mining hardware stage and redecentralize to what you were describing.  21.co is on the right trajectory, just a little early.   I think the mining landscape will be dramatically different in another 3 years.

In the meantime, we'll continue on the path of least resistance... and activate the segwit softfork.

It's not binary.  There's a ton of overlap in every startup, which then grows to become worth a billion $$$. ";1;1;False;llortoftrolls;ddlufxy;"Cofounder and CEO of Yours, Ryan X.

Is there anything Core can offer?  Like what if they just simply offered 3 MB instead of 2? obviously I'm just throwing this out there with nothing rational to back it. But you get the general idea.  Something small but significant. There's got to be something that doesn't create any additional risk, months of additional work, or cause any additional security concerns. There's got to be something.;1;0;False;BitttBurger;ddlun7l;"Cofounder and CEO of Yours, Ryan X. Charles on Twitter: ""I have to come out of the closet about something. I read r/btc, not r/bitcoin.

"Fair enough. Is there any scenario whereby we could break up pools? Or break up of these mining Farms? It seems like, and this is where I defer to not knowing enough, the code could change in a way such that X person can't contribute more than X hashing power to the network. 

A limit of some sort.

Obviously this suggestion has absolutely zero knowledge backing it and I'm not ashamed to admit that. 

I'm just tossing out a concept. 

There's got to be some way that mining could be brought back to the CPUs. Or some sort of equivalent, where everything is broken up instead of centralized. 

This literally is the foundation of all our problems.

There wouldn't be a single person on this planet bitching about what core wants to do if 500,000 individual miners were voting with their CPUs right? Every problem we have stems from this. There's got to be some way to address it. 

Thoughts?

PS:  ""intelligence"" has absolutely no correlation with career choice. If one guy chooses to be a programmer, someone equally as intelligent as he could've chosen to be a CEO with no ability to code.

The CEO is an idiot when it comes to coding.  The programmer is an idiot when it comes to business. But they're both equally smart.
