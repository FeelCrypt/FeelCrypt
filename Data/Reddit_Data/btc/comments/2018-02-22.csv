You cant. A crucial aspect of PoW is that the work being done is pointless. If it was not pointless, it would significantly reduce the cost for a 51% attack as one could use the hardware for other useful things and thus it would retain value.

Very grown-up response. Have a penny to go buy a sweet.

The majority *do* choose the way for BTC. This is demonstrated by transaction count, output, market cap, hashrate, and every other metric you could possibly use to determine decentralised selection of a crypto.

You do kind of have to argue that it's Bitcoin, because it isn't. It's Bitcoin Cash. If it's Bitcoin, why is it called Bitcoin Cash? You're somehow letting this very basic concept fly straight over your head. If it was Bitcoin, the world would call it Bitcoin.

Feel free to give Satoshi a call and ask for his opinion on scaling. While you're at it, call Carl Benz and ask whether he thinks modern cars are an improvement on his design or not.

If Ferrari took their Ferrari, took out one of the front wheels and centralised (ouch for BCH, almost too relevant there) the other, removed all electronics, took off the roof, removed the suspension and all the other mod cons and called it a ""Car Vehicle"".. well, there you've got the perfect analogy of what Ver's done in comparison to Bitcoin.

I've only just recently figured out that this has existed on blockchair for awhile now. You can query many different things on the bottom. Also there's a permalink box so you can link the exact view with all the columns.

For example, here's all the BTC blocks with over 5K inputs and 7K outputs:

https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/blocks?q=input_count(5000..),output_count(7000..)#f=id,time,guessed_miner,transaction_count,input_count,output_count,input_total,output_total,fee_total,fee_total_usd,fee_per_kb,fee_per_kb_usd,size

Which is mostly just the flood test from mid-January.

Go back and look at when the mempool was at it's peak, many blocks were only getting a few hundred transactions due to dust consolidation. Regardless though, the fact is, nobody REALLY knows why the transaction size has spiked for a 2-3 month period of time, outside of speculation. BCH has the same problem on a much larger scale - go compare the average transaction size of a bitcoin transaction to a BCH transaction. BCH fits in way less transactions per 1mb block and the transaction sizes are huge.

"> you were saying we need a fee market NOW.

Said no one ever. The point was to not go down a route that's unsustainable (because we need a fee market *eventually*).

At the time (FUD and misinformation campaigns aside), SegWit offered a superior alternative to a hard forking blocksize increase with much upside and no downside except a small increase in network bandwidth. Miners and service providers didn't seem to care much about the additional capacity. Many mining pools / much hashrate didn't signal support and service providers didn't adopt it once it was activated. This wasn't because SegWit was bad. (We know it works, it just has to be utilized.)

Presumably, some influential miners were worried about what SegWit would do to their income. Certain secretive mining optimizations that may or may not have provided a competitive advantage to some miners were incompatible with the changes. Additionally, Layer 2 applications enabled by SegWit could bring down fees dramatically. So some miners campaigned against it.

Businesses prefered to forward any scaling costs to the network users. SegWit required them to adapt and improve their processes, while a simple blocksize would've have been free for them to the detriment of the network as a whole. So some businesses campaigned against it.

Some of that transaction volume that now seems to be missing was a coordinated spam attack. There's plenty evidence pointing in that direction (some interesting @LaurentMT tweets come to mind). Another portion can be accounted for by acknowledging that some businesses have adopted batching of transactions where one transaction pays several people at once. Yet another factor is that we're in the aftermath of a bubble, where less excitement and use is to be expected.

And of course, $30 fees have had their effect too. But it isn't core's job to support and accomodate ridiculously inefficient usage of the bitcoin network. Users should blame the companies that wastefully use a precious resource and vote with their feet when this results in higher fees for them.";-3;1;False;supermari0;dunhzz2;BTC mempool just cleared out for the first time in 3 months!;7zd2tv;https://i.redd.it/hfc3lhwhuph01.png

"here's something i just messaged cobra;

question, if we take away the name ""Bitcoin"" away from BTC and BCH, what do you have left? literally, technically or economically, your call.

i think you missed a lesson from ""satoshi"", in that ""what is in a name?"" its just an illusion, a name only carries the power of authority. If it is your wish to bow to authority, to bow to a name, then so be it, but try not to lie to yourself. What is in the name ""Bitcoin"" that is left for you now? Where there was adoption there is nothing, where there was vigour and community spirit, there is just hate, jealousy and bitterness, where there was a thriving force for world change and for something *better*, there is just an echo of what you once had. While *we* strive forward .... what do you fight for now? A name? ... is that all you are worth?

-----------------------------------------
>Daily transactions? 24 hour volume?

you seem unsure? which is it, what do you measure growth by?

(btw, 24 hr volume is distorted by traders going back and forth, with 20-30k i can easily trade 500k in a day, and as others have been pointing out, daily transactions are dying on BTC)


---------------------------------------------

Roger, myself, and all of us, we are not fighting for a ""name"", that is all the BTC lot are hanging onto, we are fighting for a technology/economic model that we all fell in love with, for philosophical and societal reasons, for wanting to change the political global climate, to help put an end to endless wars and the devasting boom-bust cycles, to bring a tool to the world that will help 99% of the world to enrich *themselves*, or maybe simply because of technological interest because ""permissionless"" (not what BTC has become). Some people have 1 or 2 reasons, some have many, Roger is not different in that (stop trying to put him on a pedestal).

"> So, assuming he doesn't want inflation, that talk ist just a long winded admission of defeat?

No, not at all.

His background is science. He states the assumptions that went into his research. This is just how you do this properly. Really, ask anyone who does or ever did this for a living. Ask someone who's outside the BTC sphere. They'll confirm.

And if you want to show that something holds, you look for extra conditions you might want to introduce to show that this something holds *under these extra conditions*.

And that is what he did. It is a *partial result*. But an important one. 

You might be a paid troll and so I might waste my time here. But I remember your nick coming up repeatedly during the blocksize debate, so let me assume you are not.

So, if you would have an ounce of honesty left and are indeed looking for answers, you would stop and think now about what I just said, instead of trying to be derisive.

Think about it. Maybe just for a moment at least. Also, I don't even know where you want to drive with this. I lost my anger since the 2X failure. We simply parted ways then. If you do not like what Peter R. showed, if you think he's all for perpetual inflation, even though I have shown you that he is and was not, well then by all means stick with BTC.

I object. BU is not at all *his* pet project. He's certainly a very important, prominent and productive member, but there's a lot more folks involved, myself included.

"What percentage of those December transactions do you think were 'spam' ones? A huge amount of money was earned from fees during the peak so if the spam transactions were a big fraction, this would have cost a lot.

Understanding the interaction with fees and the blocksize limit is a bit complex. It depends how the non-spam userbase responds to increased fees:

* Do they see the big fees and decide to put off making their transaction?
* Do they just *need* to make the transaction right now, and so they proceed as normal, paying big fees?

We can make an analogy of users as a fluid -- compressible or incompressible. The fixed block size is like a fixed-volume chamber, and transaction fees are like 'pressure'.

If users reduce their footprint in response to high fees, that is analogous to a compressible gas --- if you cram more and more users into a fixed volume, the fees rise gradually since each responds by taking up less block space. I think this is what small blockers picture when they think of the fee market.

However my worry is that actually users follow the incompressible case: when they need to transact, they need to transact. They cannot just reduce their footprint. It is extremely dangerous to force incompressible fluids into a fixed volume, since once full, the pressure rises *extremely rapidly* from each small new addition.

If the users are rigid, then no spam was needed to cause that spike in fees. There were simply a bit too many users and so the system ruptured. It's possible someone could have done a small spam attack to push the system over the edge, however, it likely was not even necessary.";1;0;False;markblundeberg;dunxbma;BTC mempool just cleared out for the first time in 3 months!;7zd2tv;https://i.redd.it/hfc3lhwhuph01.png

"> A network is no good without users

That's exactly right!!!!! That's why you should support larger blocks! Geezus. Don't you see it? You can't see what has been happening? Look. I'm getting tired of this back and forth. I'm not really trying to convince you to support BCH because I know that's futile. People set in their ways are set in their ways. Fine. As you say, each camp got what it wanted, to try their own version of the right way forward. The market will do the rest. I'm cool with that. I just hate for people to have the wrong opinion/information on something if I see it and think I can show them something of benefit. So, this is the last point I'll make (besides saying, no, Nick Szabo is def not Satoshi - and also 2X was a solution ultimately nobody wanted/needed as it was a hedge, something between Maxwell and Gavin, the smallest increase v. an unlimited size, but that's not good enough as the two camps really needed to consolidate as they have between tiny blocks(Core) and huge blocks(BCH) - so that's the factual likely logic why Garzik, Voorhees etc called it off which makes sense, plus the fact Garzik has ALWAYS said he didn't want to be a lead Bitcoin Dev (you were around long enough that you should know that..) ) and the last point is LOOK at how much marketshare BTC is losing to alts! Bitcoin was once 95% of the market! Altcoins were a joke! Okay, so some altcoins might have offered cool experimental things of value like anonymity features etc, and Bitcoin dropped a bit and hovered right above 50% of marketshare. That remained for the longest time. Then as the scalability debate worsened and no block size increase occurred what happened? We saw Bitcoin's marketshare PLUMMET even quicker. I think at one point BTC was in danger of going below 30%. Now it has bounced back a bit, but is still in the 30% range because things take time as I said above, but even you shouldn't be able to ignore the fact that 50 is a lower number than 95 and 30 is lower number than 50...?
