"I continue to present that line of reasoning because you fail to answer my questions and engage in the logic you present. I am just extending your reasons for wanting to rename Bitcoin to Bitcoin OG.

But if we follow your logic and give Bitcoin a postfix like OG, then every minority fork that claims its what it forked from we will end up with absurd names like Bitcoin OG Amazing coin, then next week Bitcoin OG Amazing Wonderful, for what essentially is Bitcoin.;1;1;False;Trentw;e1jaop7;"Am I the only one that doesn't mind Bitcoin Cash being called ""Bitcoin Cash"" instead of just ""Bitcoin"" (for now)?";8h7l37;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8h7l37/am_i_the_only_one_that_doesnt_mind_bitcoin_cash/
"I have never argued that BTC can't have bitcoin in their name... I just think it should have an addition to help distinguish it. Bitcoin OG. Whatever you like. But you don't think so.

"Under your naming convention, Bitcoin Cash forks from Bitcoin, therefore Bitcoin now renames itself to Bitcoin Amazing; this shows that both Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Amazing are children of Bitcoin. Following so far?

Now Bitcoin Amazing becomes a thing in itself, just like Bitcoin did. Now along comes another group who want to fork Bitcoin Amazing, so they create minority fork Bitcoin Amazing Cash, and claim that it is just a type of Bitcoin Amazing and that no coin should have the term Bitcoin Amazing as all forks of Bitcoin Amazing are really Bitcoin Amazing. Follow so far?

Therefore the majority fork of Bitcoin Amazing needs to rename itself to Bitcoin Amazing Wonderful to avoid any confusion between itself and Bitcoin Amazing Cash. Follow so far?

Now Bitcoin Amazing Wonderful becomes a thing in itself, just like Bitcoin Amazing did. Now along comes another group who want to fork Bitcoin Amazing Wonderful, so they create minority fork Bitcoin Amazing Wonderful Cash, and claim that it is just a type of Bitcoin Amazing Wonderful and that no coin should have the term Bitcoin Amazing Wonderful as all forks of Bitcoin Amazing Wonderful are really Bitcoin Amazing Wonderful...

"The Linux example is not totally off at all! Bitcoin naming is not controversial?  Bitcoin has many components as well. Development teams. The White Paper. Different ideas on scaling. IS a fork and alt coin? What the actual purpose of bitcoin is. Is it a store of value primarily or is it a currency to replace fiat for the world? What have we been dating for the last month if not naming? As I said they are not apples to apples. But the number of parallels is staggering. For you to say it is totally off makes me wonder what we are even discussing anymore.

 I do not care what any fork names itself. Any fork can name themselves bitcoin amazing cash prime extra. Or just Prime coin or whatever they want. There is no rule about having to keep bitcoin in the name (or any other part of it) if the forkers so desire. At the same time I do not think that any chain that goes back to genesis should be denied bitcoin from their name. 

Roger can say whatever he wants. That does not make it true. He has said variations of ""Bitcoin Cash is the real bitcoin"" and ""Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Core are both bitcoin"" and ""Bitcoin Cash is more true to the white paper"" etc. I agree with the last two. But as I have stated many times I do not think Bitcoin Cash is the one and only Bitcoin and that I think that any coin that goes back to genesis are all bitcoin. Including bitcoin gold and bitcoin private and bitcoin pizza. I have been saying the same thing over and over. BTC and BCH are both bitcoin. So is BTG and Pizza even if they are imo garbage. A fork today of Bitcoin Cash would also imo be bitcoin. It could be named Bitcoin Cash II. It could be named Bitcoin Roots. It could be named Cool Coin. I dont care. We disagree what bitcoin is and that BTC chain needs a unique name. 

I do not think BCH gets special treatment. We disagree on the most basic level what bitcoin is. That's fine. The whole point of this has been trying to find a unique name for the BTC chain that you think is better than saying ""bitcoin core"". You think it is not necessary. We disagree and can not find common ground to work from.

"So you follow up until my second point. So who decides when Bitcoin needs to rename itself? Why does Bitcoin Cash get the special treatment of being Bitcoin, but Bitcoin Amazing Cash is not Bitcoin Amazing?

You see its arbitrary right, anyone can come along claim a thing to be another, just like Roger Ver did, so could Billy Bob claim that Bitcoin Amazing Cash is Bitcoin Amazing.

(The Linux example is also totally off, since day one its been controversial on what its called, mainly due to the fact an operating system is the combination of many components. The controversy even has its own wiki page!)";1;1;False;Trentw;e1j7616;"Am I the only one that doesn't mind Bitcoin Cash being called ""Bitcoin Cash"" instead of just ""Bitcoin"" (for now)?";8h7l37;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8h7l37/am_i_the_only_one_that_doesnt_mind_bitcoin_cash/
"Not my naming convention, this is your imagination and I do not follow your ""logic"" at all. I also reject your whole premise that every fork needs to retain the name of the thing that came before it. I have not once in this thread advocated for that and yet you keep pushing that point. Again we are not agreeing on the starting point so we can not agree on anything that comes after it. 

I think it is just simply more like Linux. In my opinion the Genesis Block is like the bitcoin ""kernel"" and any chain that comes off it has its own name. There are hundreds of variants of Linux with a variety of names. Some using ""Linux"" in the name and others do not. But they are all based on the same basic ""Linux"" root. Any distro has its own unique name which can append whatever they want to it or not. But no distro is called only ""Linux"". You and I do not agree on what makes bitcoin. So I am sure you will disagree with this as well. I am also aware that Linux and bitcoin are not apples to apples. But seeing as bitcoin is an entirely new beast there is no apples to apples comparison.

That is not my line of reasoning. We disagree on what is and what is not bitcoin. I have never said any chain must retain the name of even the genesis block it comes from. I have never said any chain is disqualified from using the name of the chain it has forked from but should have a unique name. BTC is no longer the only Bitcoin chain in existence. I don't think it can claim exclusive use of the bitcoin name. Some will use Cripple Coin or Core Coin or some other derogatory name. I was attempting to find a name that is not offensive to people in the BTC camp. You continue to assert I said things I never said. I think it would be better if the BTC chain had a unique fork name. You do not. What else is there to discuss? ;1;1;False;cheaplightning;e1jbl52;"Am I the only one that doesn't mind Bitcoin Cash being called ""Bitcoin Cash"" instead of just ""Bitcoin"" (for now)?";8h7l37;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8h7l37/am_i_the_only_one_that_doesnt_mind_bitcoin_cash/
">At the same time I do not think that any chain that goes back to the genesis block should be denied Bitcoin from their name.

""At the same time I do not think that any chain that goes back to the Bitcoin Amazing genesis block should be denied Bitcoin Amazing from their name"". See, it goes both ways.

Linux is inappropriate example because 1. Its name was contriversal from the start unlike Bitcoin, and 2. The Bitcoin Core software stands on its own and doesnt need bolt on software for it to work.
