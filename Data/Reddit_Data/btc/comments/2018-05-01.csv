"> Lol how's that bitcoin cash over taking bitcoin coming along? 

Slowly. Coinbase, BitPay now with BCH, but overall demand for txs in crypto dropped, as of today BTC from usability perspective doesn't look as horrible as it was Dec, 22nd, I even wouldn't be surprised if Steam brought BTC back as a payment method. Who knows how long it will take for the Flip to occur? Would a new overload be needed to crack a camel's back?

Both BCH's and BTC's market shares are in decline, so there's a chance that something better than Bitcoin will come to light, but so far I doubt it. Immutability is a huge deal

> But pointing that out is simply an appeal to popularity.

What wouldn't be appeal to popularity? If 100 people share a water resource, and 1 of those people wants to dispose of deadly poison in it, and 99 people objected, would that also also fall under your definition of this logical fallacy? 

Also, just calling things fallacies isn't an argument in itself, and you don't have to look far to call out something as a fallacy. For example, nearly any phrase that follows the words ""Well sure, obviously most people"", which are words you wrote, is almost certainly Appeal to Common Sense, which is under the umbrella of Appeal to Popularity / Tradition. The thing is, I know what you were saying with your ""obviously most people"" sentence and me pointing it out just now is a needless digression dressed up to look like an argument.

>  It doesn't negate the flawed logic of your previous ""you can just leave"" argument. 

Thousands of people do it each year. You have the option to reject the terms of the social contract completely. If nobody did it or it were essentially impossible to do, then you'd have a point, but the fact that it's a mechanism used by people every year means that it's not some hypothetical argument that can be flippantly discarded.

That link you posted was fine, but it's built around a contrived example that presupposes that the transition from ""unofficial dealer of vandals"" to ""professional dealer of vandals"" is always going to involve the threat of violence. What if, instead, the group met and discussed what to do and hired someone to do it? Then we are in the same territory as places that pick their own sheriff. And certainly people can disagree with who is picked, but as long as there is agreement to the rules before the vote and the vote is carried out fairly and transparently, then how is that authority derived from coercion? Certainly some people might say ""if I don't get my way on everything, then that is coercion."" But we don't live in an infinite world. Scarcity prevents outcomes where everyone has everything they want at all times. Unless you have a way of obviating scarcity, any system is going to reflect that scarcity exists.

"> Because you buy from merchants

Soooo...you want me to care if a merchant is charged 3% interchange? 😂 Again, I ask why I should care. The price is the same whether I pay with cryptocurrency or with USD so why would I PURPOSEFULLY PAY MORE than if I used USD just so I can save Best Buy that 3% interchange fees? I don't care about Best Buy's profit margin lmao you are hilarious. 

> Before processing fees got huge on BTC.

Lol this is hilarious. No it was when Bitcoin was crazy high in value. Why not offer a 5% discount when you are betting that Bitcoin will be worth more tomorrow? You're hilarious dude. 

Also, you still haven't directly admitted the truth: cryptocurrency users pay more for their stuff than USD users. C'mon man it's not weakness to admit the truth, just say it: ""users of cryptocurrency pay more for their items than users of USD"". See, you can even copy and paste the response. It's the truth right? Do you have an aversion to telling the truth?

Let me further illustrate how you guys get screwed on everything: I'll bet you have some bills you need to pay (mortgage/rent, cell phone etc). Show me a completely, 100% free bill payment system for cryptocurrency. You won't be able to find one because they don't exist. The ones that do exist charge anywhere from 2-3% fee with a maximum payment amount (usually around $500).

My bill payment system with my bank? Completely, 100% free to use. You pay 2% more for paying your bills in cryptocurrency. :) Thought I'd remind you of that.

How can a bank offer all these vital services for absolutely no cost to me? Interchange fees. That 3% extra on a game at Best Buy goes into my bank's pocket so they can pay their bill payment processor, so they can pay to give me free cashier's checks and so they can provide me a free checking and savings account. With cryptocurrency, that 3% is not there so they stick the consumer with the cost rather than the businesses. I pay an extra 0.60 on a $20 transaction (which you also pay btw) and I get all kinds of services for free. :)

"> A fiat currency is one that has no intrinsic value 

There is no such thing as intrinsic value, value is in the mind of the valuer. So that is your first basic economic mistake in reasoning about this. Dispense with thinking in terms of intrinsic value.

The only thing that is intrinsic to a thing is the quality of that thing, and human beings then place value on those qualities. But this placing of value is extrinsic, it must be placed in a social context. 

E.g.: oil has all the same qualities that it's always had since time immemorial. But it used to be considered just a nuisance back in the pre-modern times. It was sticky and black and sometimes caught fire, and was generally useless and the Arabs didn't know what to do with it.

Then one day someone invents the internal combustion engine which requires refining large amounts of oil into gasoline. The qualities of that oil did not change, but the value we place on its qualities did. Value was not intrinsic to oil, value can fluctuate wildly. Oil value is currently dropping as solar and wind gain momentum.

> A fiat currency is one that has no intrinsic value and is agreed upon to represent value.

The thing about fiat is that it does not, in itself, have the qualities of a good money. A strip of paper is not a great money. It's not better than gold and silver, necessarily. That is, many people would go back to using gold and silver if not for legal tender laws. Fiat then is inherently a function of state power. Fiat cannot exist unless there is a political power forcing it on the people. That aspect is missing from your definition.

Fiat is that which can only exist in association with a political power and its exercising of force, whereas other forms of free-market money do not require the use of force for them to be used as money.

The reason fiat requires force is because there is an issuing entity for fiat. Whereas, there is no issuing entity for gold, silver, or crypto, no one controls these.

Fiat requires an issuing entity because it's much cheaper to create dollar bills than the face value they are meant to represent. So without force, there would be widespread counterfeiting.

By contrast, you cannot counterfiet gold, silver, or crypto. Thus no such force is required.

I could go on.

> There is no requirement to be issued by a controlling entity or requirement to have no limit on issuance.

There is such a requirement, because of the factors I just mentioned. The controlling and issuing entities are able to print more money to enrich themselves without doing any work. If everyone were allowed to do the same the fiat currency would quickly hyperinflate and be worthless. Fiat without political force cannot survive.

> 
> 
> 
> BTW, no limit on issuance is a good thing.

This is completely false and you need to read up on your Austrian economics. A deflationary currency with a limit on issuance is strongly desirable.

"> Can you explain how Bitcoin is meant to destroy a currency that is backed by a government, complete with laws, mints, etc all working toward making more? 

Pretty easy, actually. It's already happened in many places that ditched one currency because the gov had completely mismanaged it, the people rejected that currency completely and began using other currencies.

A prime example is Honduras, where the government currency is still, to this day, completely rejected by the people. You seem to think governments are somehow all powerful, they aren't. People can ignore laws when they are untenable and the gov can't do anything, because they can't jail everyone. 

Honduras hyper-inflated their currency and abused the people with it so much that they just said fuck you guys and began using the US dollar, which was at that time a far safer and far more stable currency.

The gov did everything it could since then to get its own currency back in play, but hasn't been able to. For like over two decades now.

Honduras even created their own cryptocurrency to try to lure people back in, much as Venezuela has done, but that too has failed.

Speaking of Venezuela, the same has happened there, where dollars and crypto have taken over as the preferred currency, and no one wants Bolivars which lose value too fast.

Fiat in general loses value over time, and crypto tends to gain value over time. Long term, that implies complete replacement of fiat with crypto, just a matter of time. If you don't see that, too bad for you. Maybe your children will use crypto long after you've refused to do so, much as granny never used a computer.

> We still make pennies and that costs us an absurd amount more than they're worth, but we still make them. But you say that everyone will just magically dump fiat one day. How?

You do realize that gold and silver was once that every-day currency, for a helluva lot longer than fiat has been around, yet fiat completely replaced gold and silver, right? You have a historical model of how something gets replaced over time sitting right in front of you yet you're sitting here pretending it's somehow impossible or unthinkable.

It's pretty simple, the competing currency gets used in more and more transactions because it has advantages compared to the other currency, and soon it's doing more transactions than the other, which quickly doesn't get used anymore. Done. This can be quick or fast, but it does and has happened historically.

USD is very stable and Bitcoin poses no threat to it and very few people want to use Bitcoin because it's harder to use and the value fluctuates so badly it's utterly stupid to pay in bitcoin rather than HODL and make more.

"> Correction: how do you suggest Bitcoin will replace USD? 

Historically, all fiat eventually hyperinflates or goes badly in some way, because humans are in control of them and humans are fallible.

So really, all crypto has to do is wait for the USD to screw up in one way or another, and people will switch of their own accord. Even if that takes 100 years. Historically-speaking, the US as a world reserve currency is about at the age where most of the others were dethroned from that position. China is angling to make the yuan the next world reserve currency, but it's likely they'd be happy simply to dethrone the dollar even if the yuan doesn't become it.

At one point it was the British pound, how did they lose it? Well, there as social upheaval via war and the US came out of top. Similar things could happen to the US one day, who knows.

> I don't care what Venezuela is doing because the corruption of their government is driving the people there to every alternate currency, even USD. 

You have to recognize though that what is driving people away from the Bolivar is the exact same thing that is happening to the US dollar, the difference is only one of degree.

> 
> 
> 
> 
> In a first world country however, there is zero threat to fiat. 

Not necessarily. The US dollar actually has a unique weakness, the fact that it's a reserve currency means central banks all over the world must hold lots of dollars to defend their own currencies from speculative attacks.

If they all decide to dump the dollar, the dollar would die overnight. This isn't very likely because they'd all lose a lot of money doing that, but cascades of this sort can happen. 

There was a bank report awhile back with a central banker saying they might have to start holding reserves of bitcoin to defend against speculative attacks using cryptocurrencies. That could, long term, result in interesting problems.

If everyone tries to sell the dollar and buy crypto, that creates a similar situation to a run on the bank.

> USD is very stable 

Inflation is actually pretty high, though hidden. It's not so bad that people won't hold dollars, but people will not save in dollars.

> and Bitcoin poses no threat to it and very few people want to use Bitcoin because it's harder to use and the value fluctuates so badly it's utterly stupid to pay in bitcoin rather than HODL and make more. This is why no major companies (WalMart, Amazon, 99% of all brick and mortar stores, etc) accept Bitcoin.

Okay, keep thinking that way, but these things can change very quickly. Overstock.com took bitcoin for a time, Microsoft took bitcoin, Steam took bitcoin. They only walked back on that when transaction fees became stupid, which was 100% avoidable, but the Core devs foolishly didn't avoid it causing the community to fork and create BCH where that can't happen ever again, or at least that is the intent and expectation.

"> So really, all crypto has to do is wait for the USD to screw up in one way or another, and people will switch of their own accord. Even if that takes 100 years.

So call me in 100 years when something changes because you just admitted that no one will want bitcoin until USD is dead.

> Inflation is actually pretty high, though hidden.

Lmao you don't understand what ""stable currency"" means. A ""stable currency"" is one that changes in value very slowly. The rate of inflation is approximately 3% a year. That's very stable. Bitcoin changes price 1000% in a single year, that is *not* stable, just FYI. USD goes down 3% due to inflation, bitcoin climbs and falls 50% in a single month. Rapid inflation and deflation of 1000% in 1 year is very bad.

> It's not so bad that people won't hold dollars, but people will not save in dollars.

HAHAHAHA you think people don't save USD for reasons. WTF man.

> Steam took bitcoin

And then they stopped for lack of interest. Walmart doesn't accept it, nor do 99% of all brick and mortar store merchants. So you proudly declare that 3 merchants accept bitcoin and 20,000 do not. Who cares about 1% of merchants?

> They only walked back on that when transaction fees became stupid, which was 100% avoidable

Except this [wasn't the only reason](https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/1464096684955433613) why Steam stopped supporting bitcoin:

> As of today, Steam will no longer support Bitcoin as a payment method on our platform due to high fees *and volatility in the value of Bitcoin.*

Also:

> Historically, the value of Bitcoin has been volatile, but the degree of volatility has become extreme in the last few months, losing as much as 25% in value over a period of days. This creates a problem for customers trying to purchase games with Bitcoin. When checking out on Steam, a customer will transfer x amount of Bitcoin for the cost of the game, plus y amount of Bitcoin to cover the transaction fee charged by the Bitcoin network. The value of Bitcoin is only guaranteed for a certain period of time so if the transaction doesn’t complete within that window of time, then the amount of Bitcoin needed to cover the transaction can change. The amount it can change has been increasing recently to a point where it can be significantly different.

Epic takedown of why Bitcoin is such a shit currency.

Let me explain: if you are Steam and someone buys a game on it for $20 in bitcoin, then bitcoin falls in value by 50% (as an example), then you just made $10 instead of $20. If someone buys a game on it for $20 and then bitcoin rises in value by 50%, then you just made $30 instead of $20. ""Oh that second one sounds amazing though, you can make free money!"" you are saying to yourself right now, but when bitcoin rises in value, what do you think that does to usage of bitcoin? Why would you use a currency that is currently rising in value when you could just use the USD in your bank account instead to make the same purchase? When bitcoin price rises, transactions fall because people make more money by not selling.

> If you create a word whose meaning is obvious, then it has done the job of a word, to communicate a concept. 

Ok, so what is a bitcoinization (another made up word)? By it's base roots, it comes up to ""bitcoin"" and ""-ization"". The ""-ization"" part means ""Action, process, or result of doing or making"". So, bitcoinization is not ""the replacement of USD with bitcoin"", it is ""the action of bitcoin"" (purchasing something with bitcoin?), ""the process of bitcoin"" (how bitcoin works?) or ""the result of making bitcoin"" (is ""paying with bitcoin"" bitcoinization?). Which one is it? It could also be interpreted to mean that there is a ""hyper-bitcoin"" and the ""-ization"" part could mean ""replacing regular bitcoin with hyper bitcoin"". The idea of words is to communicate the meaning of a sentence in as few words as possible. Someone who doesn't know anything about bitcoin is not going to understand what ""hyperbitcoinization"" means. You could cut down on confusion and simply say ""rapid adoption of bitcoin"", which communicates the same phrase without any chance of confusion by using two made up words in a seven-syllable word.

Further examples: ""rationalization"" is ""the action of rationalizing"". ""Hospitalization"" is ""the action of hospitalizing"". Hyperbitcoinization is ""the extremely rapid action of bitcoin/bitcoining"". Wait, what?

This is why when Zimbabwe started rapidly adopting the USD instead of the Zimbabwe dollar, they didn't call it ""hyperusdollarization"" and instead used the much simpler phrase ""rapidly adopted USD"". Don't make up a word when there already exists a phrase that can explain it easier and simpler.

Uh, what is a ""transaction fee""? Because I've never encountered one in my life. When the sandwich is $6 I pay $6 USD. Wtf are you talking about? I've never once in my life paid extra for a transaction. Cryptocurrency users pay those fees all the time though, so if you want to stop paying extra for your stuff, come over to fiat!

Also, a question for you: what kind of discount does Overstock.com or Microsoft.com give you for paying in bitcoin? I know the answer, I just want to hear it from you so you can admit it since we're talking about fees. =) Also, while you're at it, how much bitcoin would I pay for a $60 game? I know the answer again, I just want to show you why bitcoin is a terrible currency compared to USD because for a $60 game, I pay $60. For any website in the world, I pay whatever the USD price tag says. For bitcoiners, they pay an additional fee on top of the USD price, so....yeah. If you don't want to pay extra for your stuff, you can use USD like everyone else does.

"A hardfork is when you change the consensus rules. This means that people that don't update their software to the new rules won't be able to still connect to the network of the people that have updated their software. 

So if there are Bitcoin Cash miners after may 15th that have no updated their mining software ... they will get errors and if they don't want to lose money they will update so they can mine again.

Users that don't mine use Simple Payment Verificication and don't need to do anything. Businesses that run full nodes but don't mine will also have to update or they will be stuck on the network still on old rules. That network will quickly become smaller and smaller forcing everybody to also update. If only 50 or 60% of the miners choose to do the update there might be some problems for a while but I think the support for the update is over 80% so it probablly won't be a problem at all.



This is the theory. In practise the miners can also say: oh yeah, uh no we won't do the update. But we already know that miners want to do the update so it's all good.

Since fork, none of the chain deserves to be called simply bitcoin. 

Bitcoin cash is bitcoin and bitcoin core is bitcoin, but we have to make it clear which one we talk about. I prefer bitcoin cash and bitcoin core.

Bitcoin core supporters fought vigorously against bitcoin cash right to be bitcoin, so they labeled it bcash. 

I was more generous and called bitcoin on btc chain - bitcoin core.

In fact, I have done it before Roger Ver you mention so often, and making this so needed  distinction resulted in me being ban in r/bitcoin .

"> Bitcoin core is bitcoin on btc chain and is not referring to just a client.

> Bitcoin cash is bitcoin on bch chain and it has more than ABC client.

Just like Bitcoin has more than the core client.

> You can fight against bitcoin cash as much as you want.

I do not want at all. All I am doing is getting things into perspective. Roger calling Bitcoin ""Bitcoin core"" and calling Bitcoin Cash ""Bitcoin"" is such a ridiculous step, that takes all credibility away from him in the overall Bitcoin community. That was too obvious of course, so he corrected it again. But also calling Bitcoin ""Bitcoin Core"", as he is still doing, is ridiculous, and I made this remark to point out why, by drawing the analogy to bitcoin ABC for Bitcoin Cash.

so Roger is the one attacking Bitcoin, not I am attacking Bitcoin Cash. you should know that. I am only critizising wrong and manipulative information. If Bitcoin Cash does its thing, I  am perfectly happy with it and I have no reason at all to ""fight"" it. On the contrary, it is good to have a playground for the camp that thinks on chain scaling is the way to go, and they shall do so with Bitcoin Cash and stop blocking Bitcoin's evolution (as they did wehn segwit was blocked), so it is good that Bitcoin Cash exists.

Again, to be very clear: I absolutely ENDORSE Bitcoin Cash's existence! But I despise the attempts to discredit Bitcoin, as it happens to be the case from some the Bitcoin Cash supporters, unfortunately.

> You can spread fud and misinformation, but you can't stop us.

From what I said above, you'll understand that you directed this statement to the wrong person. Not applicable to me.

But I can tell you: YOU can spread FUD and misinformation about Bitcoin (as you just did by adopting Roger's narrative as your own), but you cannot stop Bitcoin.

Note that I am saying ""cannot stop **Bitcoin**"" and not ""cannot stop **us**"", as you can see. This is because I do not identify myself with Bitcoin (or any coin). You must have a strong self-identification with Bitcoin Cash and a strong opposition against Bitcoin, otherwise you wouldn't have written ""us"".
