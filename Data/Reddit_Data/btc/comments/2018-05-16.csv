"""It is always possible to put the money into money markets, state bonds, low cost funds and large company stocks for long term returns""

-Again, missed the point. A savings account/all that security of a savings account USED to return well beyond 3%+, and then '08 hit. So, we have been conditioned to believe that 'savings account = unavoidable losses to inflation,' when that is really a recent change in lets say the last 50 years of 'modern banking.' Not making a judgement on it, but you are NOW paying that 2% fee. 

-Comparing money market/muni bonds/large cap equities to a savings account as investment alternatives is beyond apples to oranges, it's like apples to cars. Entirely different returns/risk for different savings goals. Again, my point is, strictly for savings, you could get 3%+ for all the stability of a savings account, now you can't. 

-Money market  return well sub 2%, so same issue of not beating inflation. Munis beat 2%, but don't belong in the discussion with short term savings due to limitations on access to principle, plus high IR/price risk as far as a short term savings vehicle. Large company stocks don't even belong in this conversation bc those, or any equities, shouldn't be used for anything short of a 10 year + saving goal. Again, apples : cars. 
Low cost funds apply to any sort of investment, so not applicable. 

Not sure where you are getting those money market rates:

"It is always possible to put the money into money markets, state bonds, low cost funds and large company stocks for long term returns, they are all insured under the same general rules, it is money that is not instantly available but it is still your money.

Everything above an emergency fund and living expenses/rent for some months is not necessary for the bank account that is used for day-to-day use, and the cost of low interest is as you say the price people are willing to pay for peace of mind.

Even 6 month money markets caps out at about 2% interest per year, so a 5000$ emergency fund in a near 0% interest account costs 75$ a year in lost interest (after taxes), a low price to pay for the convenience, peace of mind and lack of fees for daily use.";1;1;False;redcatredcatred;dz1s8gp;1 For whoever questions the utility of Bitcoin, here's banking summarized accurately;https://i.redd.it/xa71uovqkuw01.jpg

That's not very coherent. Sorry, enjoy your ambiguity.;1;2;False;Trentw;dz1l9uq;"Am I the only one that doesn't mind Bitcoin Cash being called ""Bitcoin Cash"" instead of just ""Bitcoin"" (for now)?";https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8h7l37/am_i_the_only_one_that_doesnt_mind_bitcoin_cash/
"But it is what you are talking about and it is at the very heart of the debate here. I agree with you that while the ticker symbols for BTC and BCH are what they are that this sub is named wrong. However when it was started it was before there was only one version of bitcoin which was often shortened to BTC.  You disagree that Bitcoin Cash is also bitcoin and therefore is not deserving of Bitcoin.com and @Bitcoin. But there is more than one fork of Bitcoin now. If it shares the genesis block it is a fork of bitcoin. As I have stated elsewhere the name Bitcoin Core has only been labeled as such due to it being developed by the core team. Where as I would be happy to start calling it ""Bitcoin Segwit"" or ""Bitcoin Lightning"" or ""Bitcoin SL"" if it made BTC supporters happy. People in the core camp will not accept anything other than just straight ""Bitcoin"" I assume. You say ""What mess have you guys got yourself into? "" It takes two to tango. Everything done on this ""side"" has been as a direct reaction to what many of us believe to be poor/wrong/inappropriate actions from that ""side"".

Not really what I was talking about, but feel free to run the standard bitcoin cash line on me. I was commenting on how inappropriate and ambiguous the name bitcoin core is for Bitcoin, as for one there is already something called Bitcoin Core.;1;1;False;Trentw;dz1hk5e;"Am I the only one that doesn't mind Bitcoin Cash being called ""Bitcoin Cash"" instead of just ""Bitcoin"" (for now)?";https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8h7l37/am_i_the_only_one_that_doesnt_mind_bitcoin_cash/
