"The oldest popular contract is the standard multisig wallet in Mist, which has m-of-n transactions and a daily spending limit for any single address. A recent variation puts a delay on spends by single keys; the bigger the spend, the longer the delay, so other keys have more time to cancel. Lots of people use these to secure their funds.

I would say Kickstarter-style fundraising and token sales are valid uses too; they're prominent right now because we're still in a fairly early phase of Ethereum's history. All that's working extremely well.

There are several gambling contracts in production...similar to SatoshiDice except with fancier games and good UI, and without necessarily having to trust the operator to provide fair randomness.

Lots more is coming this year, but that's what's available right now, off the top of my head.

What they do (where doing mostly refers to their immune systems response) is detect a pest that could be a nuisance and let their white blood cells inhibit the pest while their bone marrow figures out an antibody. I.e. they attack the intruder and and keep attacking till they find a way to kill it, and it's all an unconscious response to any challenge no matter how slight.

What they have been doing to Bitcoin was trying to find a central point to attack, and not finding any. Then trying to legislate it out of existence, but this was only a half-hearted immune response because it's basically pointless.

"Your characterization of bitcoin being money and ethereum being a dev platform is approximately right. Unfortunately, it's also irrelevant.

Ethereum is also money, and in an attempt not to draw the ire of the establishment, Ethereum tries very very hard to downplay that aspect. It is however not fooling anybody, Ethereum is still a cryptocurrency.

Cryptocurrencies challenge a status quo, and that status quo is fiat currency. Our world is built from top to bottom on fiat currency. It's been moderately popular in the past, but the last 100 years was the age of fiat currency. Fiat currency is attractive to those in power because it's debt based (so it allows endless rent-seeking) and it can be used by state actors to finance their deficit spending as well as assert dominance over each other.

We are however in the end-stages of the age of fiat, as we have been living under a strange regime of negative interest rates (you get punished for saving up), ballooning personal debt and a sequence of boom&busts the last one or two decades. This isn't brought on per-se by the age of fiat (though it could be argued it's a natural consequence of a debt based system). But it is certainly brought on by the prevailing economic doctrine, that is Keynesianism (altough todays Keynesians take Keynesianism to extremes that would make Keynes rotate in his grave, but I digress). In an ironic twist of fate, Kynes formulated his doctrine as a response to the cycles of booms&busts that where perceived to be brought on by using a deflationary currency (they where in fact brought on by irresponsible bankers, deficit spending and irresponsible lending).

At its core the entire fiat/keynesianism/debt construct is designed to consolidate power in the hands of the few while maintaining the illusion of democracy and comfortable living for the many.

And that is what cryptocurrencies essentially challenge. They challenge 100 years of economic doctrine, state power over money and all the power that got consolidated by these mechanisms in the last 100 years. That's what everybody, Bitcoin, Etherum etc. is up against.

The competition that Bitcoin has with Etherum in this context simply doesn't matter. It doesn't even register on the radar.

What has been done to Bitcoin hasn not been done to it by Ethereum. But something was done to Bitcoin, I mean, we are in pretty serious deep shit. By all indications, it was done to Bitcoin by itself, but that makes very little logical sense. So you have to ask: Who was doing the doing, and who expects to benefit from it? And the answer isn't ""Etherum"". And if it isn't ""Ethereum"" then the conclusion is that Ethereum only exists relatively unmolested because those doing the doing (of destroying Bitcoin) simply don't (yet) care about Ethereum. And now you know why I'm worried about Ethereum when Bitcoin goes bust. Because those doing the destroying of Bitcoin haven't gone anywhere, they're still there, still challenged, and now fresh out of a focus of their attention.";15;3;False;pyalot;dfh0x9v;I am stepping down as a moderator of r/btc and exiting the bitcoin community and entering the Ethereum community.;61sim7;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/61sim7/i_am_stepping_down_as_a_moderator_of_rbtc_and/

1 hash = 1 vote is the only voting mechanism Bitcoin has ever had. There is no 'Economic Majority and Censored Reddit Sub Upvote Algorithm' inherent to Bitcoins design. Bitcoin cannot detect what Core supporters and it appears you are claiming it can detect. Bitcoin was designed to overcome issues like this through Nakamoto Consensus... which is miners using their votes. The devs who usurped the Core name three years ago have been doing a really great job at convincing a portion of the community that somehow immeasurable and easily manipulated things like 'users and economic majority' somehow have an impact on Bitcoins consensus system... they don't.

Bitcoin Unlimited removes the poisonous dictators... increases the blocksize... and provides decentralized development to ensure no new dictators arrive. Multiple teams can work on seperate but compatible clients... teams will actually rise and fall and it would be encouraged. The current Core devs... who have only really been in charge for about four years and aren't the original team whatsoever want to be Bitcoin kings forever... brainwashing the public with insane anti bitcoin ideas like users and economic majority someone are what attain consesnsus. Nakamoto consensus is about one thing... miners supporting code... 1 hash = 1 vote. That is all it has ever been yet they spew propoganda and make it seem like freaking reddit upvotes and other immeasurable things somehow impact hte network. The clearly feel entitled to their dictator power position and don't want to let go. The massive mismanagement of the code and community has caused this situation. The miners have always adjusted their blocksize... they just happened to finally hit the 1mb limit this last year and now the system is clogged. The limit should be removed and transactions allowed to flow freely and market forces do their work.

"LOL

ETH is growing in all areas and does everything Bitcoin can do but faster and better. Ethereum transaction times are 14 seconds and Bitcoins are 10 minute + and many times to 1 hour!

For investors who look to get a good risk reward, ETH is the one not Bitcoin. Again, ETH can do everything what BTC can do, which is not much! PLUS it has smartcontract functionality which is huge, it will change the world. Bitcoin is old and to expensive, when the network effects starts to die out the new better blockchain will take over, and it's already happening! A mass exodus is starting and ETH price keeps gaining and BTC will stop going up. All the money that went into Bitcoin is now flowing into ETH. And Once Bitcoiners find out about ETH it will be of to the races, BTC will fall like a knife.

Good points from a Bitcoin perspective... but the world doesn't seem to care since the business support and new fiat coming in is quite big. The ETH community really doesn't care since the majority voted for the DAO fork. Part of Vitalik's pitch for the whole thing was 'hey, we are different, we aren't Bitcoin and don't play by those exact rules' and the community agreed like 95%. So ETH isn't playing by Bitcoins rules, it is making its own and finding success anyway... which I think is cool. I don't think Bitcoin will go away either... I don't want it too...

"Bitcoin is fighting for survival in the same way a weed seedling is fighting for survival when the Gardener casually plucks it out while tending his plants. The gardener is hardly fighting the weed at that point, it doesn't require much effort or even thought to do it. It's simply a reflexive action and part of the routine of maintaining your garden. The gardener doesn't wait to pluck out the weed until it's grown into an infestation of a plot requiring to deep plow over that plot. Why ignore upkeep and later having a lot of trouble if you can avoid it with a bit of maintenance. Right now cryptocurrencies are a hardly noticable nuisance to the establishment and it hardly costs any effort or cost to keep them in check.

You must not forget that Bitcoin is tiny, and Ethereum is even tinier, it's hardly even grown into a seedling yet, so it's far far below the notice of the gardener.

"Excellent summary. I think the difference is that Bitcoin, being currency first and maybe a platform for other things... at some point, has a different relationship to the fiat world than does Ethereum.

Bitcoin depends on the fiat economy for its value and existence. If (when) the fiat economy fails, bitcoins have no value because the world that makes things and provides services can't run on Bitcoin's computing power because that power is dedicated to hashing nonces.

The legacy economy actually *can* transition to Ethereum, and if the platform is successful then it most certainly will, just like it transitioned to the Internet over the past couple of decades.

So the value of Eth can be compared to the value of Bitcoin or fiat legacy currencies, but the more important value of Eth over time will be as a measure of the value which is actually produced on the network.";2;0;False;BadLibertarian;dfh61te;I am stepping down as a moderator of r/btc and exiting the bitcoin community and entering the Ethereum community.;61sim7;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/61sim7/i_am_stepping_down_as_a_moderator_of_rbtc_and/

"Thanks for this great post.  
I'm out of bitcoin myself for these exact same reasons.
One thing that I find sad is that almost everyone on the crypto subreddits is pumping something.  If you listen to this guy, it's Ethereum, if you listen to another it's BU, another is Segwit, another is Monero or even Dash.

This makes a very bad space for innovation, since no one seems to be able to develop and wait/participate and everyone is in there for their quick buck or long term holdings that would mimic the early adopters in bitcoin gains. The gains made back then at sub 3$ are not possible to repeat. Simple as that. We get scams, morons, pumpers and other sorts of behaviour, comparable to the end of the 90s tech bubble.

There's too much greed and too little real innovation. Getting the bitcoin network to as 5$ for a transaction of 500$ and let the user wait for 2-8 hours is a shame, and the people who let this happen are the same ones telling you they have the magic solution. Like a virus making, anti-virus company. Innovation in payments will be made.
  
Performant network <> freedom/anonymity <> affordable price for participation (tx) <> payment solution  <> store of value  <> decentralisation <> security 
  
Are all factors that are all influencing each other.  But we will never have all of it.

"What you want out of a cryptocurrency, citing actions such as the Ethereum hard fork to stop the as-written execution of the DAO script and the central leadership of a founder, is the antithesis of a network whose primary property is trust. That's not a statement of ideology, but of computer science. Non-authoritative trust as a network property doesn't yet exist as an absolute state, and Bitcoin is overwhelmingly the closest we have graduated towards that state.

We want mutually incompatible things out of Bitcoin. I'm sorry you're unable to see the value in a trust network like Bitcoin. I'm however glad that there are services that do provide the feature set you are looking for which you can migrate to. There is no other blockchain displaying the properties of trust via decentralized security model the way Bitcoin is currently - I don't have the option to just pick another horse at this time the way you do to follow my desired protocol properties.

You're concluding that Bitcoin losing the fight against Ethereum is like MySpace losing the fight against Facebook. This is not the case. Bitcoin would be losing the fight against the status quo and the establishment. And after the establishment is done with Bitcoin, Ethereum is next. All your good intentions, well setup governance, holding hands and singing kumbaya will not save you from coming under the same attack that Bitcoin is under, and it will shred Ethereum to pieces much quicker.

What you're actually looking at is like what would have happened if both MySpace and Facebook where fighting for their survival if the traditional media had a lobby back then that was strong enough to get anti-social-network laws passed, and facebook celebrated taking out MySpace which was the only thing keeping the lobby mob off their backs.

Yes I see that Bitcoin is apparently tearing itself apart from the inside. But when something like that happens, do you just go ""oh okay, whatever."" or do you ask ""why?"". Because if you don't ask ""why?"" how can you be sure Ethereum won't do that to itself? You can't, you don't know the reason, you haven't even started reasoning about the reason, yet you simply assume that a slightly different flavor protects you from everything. How naive are you really?

Why is bitcoin tearing itself apart, because apparently, for motives we can only deduce, people in power have chosen to run it into the ground. How did those people get into power? They slowly accumulated and consolidated it with the help of some Banks and the financial elite. Why would companies apparently invest money into something only to intentionally run their investment into the ground? Well why indeed, that seems fairly not greedy and not rational.

Exactly, sticking your heels in the ground screaming hardforks are dangerous and repeating it is a self-fulfilling prophecy.    
The only reason a hardfork is even contentious in the first place is because Core made sure they were. If core just did as satoshi suggested in 2010, there would be no problem, and bitcoin would still have at least 85% market share. (probably even 90%+)     
    
> They have petrified the bitcoin community and convinced them that any kind of hard fork for any reason that does not come from them is dangerous. They have done this to hold onto the power they should not even have in the first place. They have become the self appointed kings of bitcoin. They have achieved this by threatening to burn down the network instead of making a compromise, and by attacking anyone who threatens to take this power away from them.       
     
They are the de-facto dictators of bitcoin, and everyone here in /r/btc knows it. And somehow they are still able to convince a large group of people that roger ver/jihan wu are the enemies. I am stunned that their propaganda is so effective.

"This is *exactly* why cryptocurrency will *never* be a sustainably stable form of currency unless a major economic state power adopts it. (Which will never happen because that means loss of control over printing.)

**The notion that cryptocurrency is a limited resource is a myth**.

Any given implementation may, in fact, be limited, but the fact that there are mathematically *unlimited* numbers of possible algorithms and protocols to establish such a currency means that **cryptocurrency is fiat, not intrinsic.**

As one reaches its prime, the miners will migrate to the ""next big thing"" in order to validate reasonable returns, and as that bubble blows up, the users will migrate and invest. And when that reaches the prime, the miners will move on and the cycle will continue.

Without forceful adoption by a strong nation state, *no* cryptocurrency can be sustained indefinitely. This is, unfortunately, not much more than a de facto pyramid scheme, unbeknownst to even the pioneers. It requires no ill intent to undermine any given cryptocurrency as the bubbles blow up and pop, time and again. But they *will* each fail as everyone moves on to the next big thing.

"I've already moved into ETH and related projects as well, I think you are absolutely right.

Even at 75% there is no guarantee that miners will figure this out. That isn't an activation threshold, just a target optimal for a hard fork. Actually getting miners to do it successfully, to decide what size to increase blocks to amongst them, will be nearly impossible. As you say, Core devs and supporters will double up on clouding everything, which means we are still probably months and months from an end if at all. It seems like miners are more divided on this than ever after what I just read here today.

EThs approach is quite novel, moving to PoS soon to eliminate this from happening there, *ever*, but still has some PoW properties in the way it calculates network resource usage to execute a contract. 

Meanwhile, I see demos like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6-rf68taTs) from months ago actually showing what Ethereum can do with some imagination. No use cases?

I can completely understand where you're coming from.

However, things have changed drastically, as there is real competition now. I firmly believe that Ethereum's market cap will surpass Bitcoin's cap this year - which won't mean that 1 ETH will be worth more than 1 BTC because there are simply more ETH in circulation, but I think we will get to that point in time as well.

Bitcoin's do or die period is nearing its end, companies and whales are making the switch bit by bit. I also believe that there will be no resolution to this scaling debate, ever.

First, sorry to see you go. If you honestly believe what you wrote here then no one can blame you for not sticking around. If you think that bitcoin's failure is a foregone conclusion (or at least close enough to a 100% probability event), then it is no one's place to make you stick around.

That said, your scenarios seem awfully detailed and drawn out for a system that is as complex as bitcoin, with many assumptions scattered here and there. I'm not saying you're not entitled to a few assumptions when trying to predict the future, but if you include too many, they add up exponentially until the probability of your forecast coming true drops down to pretty much negligible territory.

I'm not saying that we shouldn't think about the future, but maybe it's more useful to discuss the future in more general terms without making too many assumptions.

Since some people might be curious, as an example here is a list of questionable assumptions included in Scenario 1:

For all we know, EC getting 75% of the hashrate might result in significant user attrition over at /r/bitcoin as people realize ""holy shit /r/btc was right."" Sure you might have a few hardcore holdouts, but I don't think there will necessarily be enough of them to precipitate the scenario you describe regarding the price. For every pissed of bitcoin baron in the Core camp, you will also have people with deep pockets who understand EC who will support the price with buying activity. In fact I personally hope that there is a dump of fresh bitcoin by core holdouts so that there is a final and definitive wealth transfer from bad actors to good actors.

>After the fork happens the price could go down to literally any level.

Again, how do you know? Even in the worst case scenario of a holdout minority chain, in this scenario the EC miners have a supermajority and they can disrupt the competing chain, forcing a PoW change. Of course, a PoW change will mean that the minoity chain no longer has any of the massive hashing power of the majority bitcoin network, which also leaves them open to attack. At the same time. Neutral investors will absolutely punish the price of the minority chain if their security is poor, which it will be.

>While this is happening, the Ethereum market cap is going to overtake bitcoin even if the Ethereum price does not increase (which it will).

Possible, but how can you be sure? There's no denying that Ethereum and all the other alts are looking a bit bubbly these days. How can you be sure that Ethereum will be within striking distance of bitcoin?     

Anyway, good luck with your future endeavors. I sincerely hope we see you here again some time in the future.

"> The move to full Market Governance is always a rocky one

This is probably the best part of what I've read about Bitcoin in a while - some true insight into the nature of the entire 2-3 years of discussion. /u/ForkiusMaximus, I do generally read and value your comments about Bitcoin governance.

I had some other counterpoints of varying importance I thought of discussing, but I'll really highlight this:

-The current situation is an (another?) example of the weakness of PoW.  All of the discussion about centralization and, more recently, of Developers vs. Miners highlights the conceptual error of PoW.  ASICs, economy of scale, lack of incentive for non-mining nodes, free / cheap electricity in geographical regions - all of those things indicate that PoW will fail.  It's a topic that has been discussed and worried about for some time.  Is PoW an ideal like communism - it works on paper but is simply screwed up when you get enough people involved? 

Other comments in short -Community around Bitcoin is almost self-destructive even near the ATH in price.  -Quite a few other altcoins (more than Ethereum) are implementing solutions to Bitcoin's problems and aren't carrying its baggage.  [Smart contracts, their own versions of LN, governance within the network, node incentives, obscured / truly anonymous transactions, various versions of PoS or other decentralizing techniques, blockchain sharding / merge mining, mimblewimble, no blocksize limit :-) ]   -From a transaction perspective, there is little reason for me to hold Bitcoin instead of buy-and-use.  From an investment perspective, it's about risk vs. reward potential.  -Along the lines of your inflammatory comment, ""Greg Maxwell""";12;2;False;Venij;dfha1zx;I am stepping down as a moderator of r/btc and exiting the bitcoin community and entering the Ethereum community.;61sim7;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/61sim7/i_am_stepping_down_as_a_moderator_of_rbtc_and/

"I  can see where you are coming from with most of this, but I feel it is coming from a place of denial more than critical analysis.

This tech is rewriting the social contract as to what ""sound money"" even is to us. It isn't ""sound money"" to me when 10 or so people can hold my money and the network it depends on hostage out of hostility or ignorance. A relatively small amount of capital is all it took to turn Bitcoin on it's head, and that is unacceptable and definitely not ""anti-fragile"". Any millionaire or VC can build a mining farm and buy a vote and pay off any dev it wants to. A system like that is already what we have in use today full of lobbyist pricks and special interests. 

I don't believe the  Core devs did this more than Bitcoin's flawed design did, it is just a byproduct of the root issue. The second ASICs came on to the scene and millionaire backers shoved out normal users from voting, nothing Satoshi even considered, was the beginning of the end as a gross distortion to what the project was originally about: a truly peer to peer cash system where all real users had a say as miners doing some work for the network.  Ethereum does this way better than Bitcoin ever did or could have. It is ok to admit that maybe Bitcoin isn't the best way to do what Satoshi was after, just the first attempt to do so as the first working example of a merkle blockchain, there was no way to know how it would turn out as an experiment.  We know it now, and Bitcoin has serious deficiencies that its consensus mechanisms failed to address. Even if a HF happens soon, this same fundamental problem will continue to bite the project going forward. A simple scaling increase was too much to ask for 3 years, what about bigger changes later? 

The investors did largely approve that rollback on the basis of Ethereum still being in beta essentially, and the minority miners who disagreed were allowed to go off on their own, exactly as blockchains are designed to work, so I don't see what the problem is. 

I don't know if Ethereum is it, but I know Bitcoin is definitely not it at this point. I had to overcome a lot of nostalgia to decide it was time to invest my time and energy elsewhere. I will never touch BTC again as long as Blockstream is involved in any way, that much is certain. I do hope you won't dismiss Ethereum without taking a serious look.

"Why I invest in Dash?

Ethereum is great. It's a programmable block chain with lots of level 2 projects, Raiden, Augur, StorJ, etc... I hold some Ethereum, but Dash is my biggest position nowadays.

I feel that Dash is much simpler to use and more focused to be Money.

1. Instant transactions (InstantSend). About 2 seconds in Dash vs 17 sec in Ethereum is very important for retail brick-n-mortar shops. Compared to 10 min in Bitcoin on it's best-day.

2. Dash Masternode Voting - governance mechanism, similar to shareholder voting in traditional corporations.

3. Incentivized Masternodes. - even if our block chain will grow huge, it's incentivized to buy new hardware to keep up with demand.

4. Dash network can pay it's own expenses right of the block chain and even sponsor an advertisement campaign from it's block chain rewards. Bitcoin and Ethereum never had anything like it. Put it simply, the economic model of Dash is superior. For example we will vote with our Masternodes for Charlie Shrem's Dash Mastercard, and he will get paid by the Dash network for his start-up business.
https://www.dashcentral.org/p/DASHPAYCARD-DEBIT-CARD

4. Dash is a drop-in replacement for Bitcoin, while Ethereum has a learning curve. It means that it's easier to adopt for merchants, that already accepts Bitcoin. Dash wallets are simpler to use.

5. I think Ethereum could become the Linux of crypto-currencies. Scalable, programmable, powerful and open, but hard to use. Especially if you want some advanced features. Very few people can take advantage of the Linux system, as compared to Windows. Same here: very few people will have the technical skills to take advantage of Ethereum's programmability, while Dash stays much simpler for day-to-day use.

6. Biggest reason by far: Bitcoin is broken. My transactions take between 3 hours up to 26 hours to confirm, when a year ago I used to confirm in 10 minutes . Bitcoin used to provide me a service, but now it provides me a dis-service. I have sold most of my Bitcoins for Dash.

Disclaimer: I own both Dash and Ethereum, but proportionally much more capital in Dash. I used to hold lots of Bitcoin until 2017.

"You're right in a fashion, but sadly uninformed. For Bitcoin, this is an epic fight for survival in the same way that for a bacteria it's an epic fight for survival to be attacked by the immune system. For the body, it's hardly any calories worth mentioning spent and not even an elevated temperature.

Society is a self-perpetuating pattern, and that pattern is carefully cultivated like a garden by those gaining the most of it (and that's not the plants and insects living in it). A gardner casually plucks out any weed seedling that sprouts as a matter of habitual upkeep, it's not a fight for the gardener at that point, but it is, for the seedling. But for the Gardner it's a lot better than having to uproot and deep plow a plot once a weed infestation has taken root.

Why spend a lot of effort fighting something if you can pluck it out before it has set in roots?

That's how the establishment works, and it's how it patterns society to work. Most are unwitting cells in the great body that is society, and you act on the rules and conventions set forth by its carefully bred genetic code. Cryptocurrencies challange that, and no matter how small the challenge, there will be an immune response, and that immune response will be proportional, meaning that at every stage, it's a fight for survival. Your body doesn't ignore a microbe it doesn't like just because it's not worth killing by itself. It attacks that microbe because it can't allow it to multiply and do real harm.

It's a mystery to me how you people don't realize that. How you're conditioned to ridicule the very real attack on Bitcoin as a coincidence. How you seem to be abjectly blind that Bitcoin is indeed being attacked, and that it's in the process of dying because of that attack, and that the other microbes should be getting quite nervous around at that point...

How do you think your negotiating position in Ethereum is when Bitcoin gets wiped out this way?

""Ethereum you have to implement address registering of all users and all users have to hand over their private keys so we can do KYC and AML"". 

* Bitcoin is dead: ""oh mkay (._.), please don't Bitcoin us.""
* Bitcoin is still alive: ""Screw you, Bitcoin is still around and kicking after you tried to kill it, we're not afraid of you.""

"This looks like a good contrarian indicator.

The nature of Bitcoin's binary bet is that the next stage of success involves at least an order of magnitude more investment than all that came before. Even if half the current investors dumped BTC after a fork to bigger blocks, there are 10x as many investors waiting to jump in. 

Besides, in fork trading most of those eager to dump will be keeping their small block BTC, allowing us big blockers to dump the small block BTC on them at a premium. We actually make *more* money in this process, by forking. So this is indeed just another case of someone calling Bitcoin dead because of not understanding.

Ethereum has its Gavin now, but is he going to be able to resist what happened to Bitcoin's Gavin? And if he does, it's even more hazardous. The move to full [Market Governance](https://bitcoindebates.miraheze.org/wiki/Market_Governance_FAQ) is always a rocky one, but Bitcoin is furthest along by far.

Most realistically, I just did my monthly googling to find out if the dark markets - one of the only places in crypto where real brass-tacks commerce happens - are complaining about high fees, backlogs, and switching to altcoins. Result? 

- very few complaints about high fees

- quite a few ""why no confirmation yet"" posts but universally answered with ""just bump the fee"" and then ""thanks guys, that solved it"" 

- negligible use of any altcoins by vendors or buyers - despite much-hyped incorporation of a few of them in by the markets

Clearly the network effect is much stronger than 50-cent or even dollar fees for these guys, and although the situation is getting very worrying it is exactly now that the miners are mobilizing. That makes it odd timing to leave. 

Your mention of all these devs tinkering in Ethereum makes me think you really haven't understood. Sound money is THE use case. It blows everything else out of the water, and it *already works.* The blocksize cap is the only thing standing in Bitcoin's way for the next couple orders of magnitude in adoption and price, and it is about to fall. Smart contracts and DAOs are neat but we shouldn't so easily forget that Bitcoin is a historic invention and just throwing random spaghetti at the wall a hundred times isn't going to automatically work to create another revolution. 

Devs gotta dev is what got Bitcoin into this mess; I don't think it's going to help Ethereum, especially with investors who approve of ledger edits and after seeing how incresibly much harder smart contracts were than they all thought, having been busted out of that utopian daze, they still doubled the price from where it was when ill-fated TheDAO drove it all the way up to $20+. 

Finally, and this is inflammatory but I have to mention it, when I spent some time on the Ethereum subreddits last summer I found the average level of intelligence and economic understanding to be far lower than in the Bitcoin subs, as well as a fetish for pie-in-the-sky schemes with little critical examination (I know I know, bitcoiners love their LN vapor mesh network fantasies, but I'm talking even worse than that). Not that there aren't very smart people in Ethereum, but the average is very worrying - these investors are not going to be strong hands.
