"I think 80% is usually a good threshold.  It really depends on the people in the group though and how many loud voices (and personalities) there are drowning out others.

The one thing that has troubled me about some of the people who have rage quit core and caused so much damage in this space afterwards, is that often they are soooo technically adept and so used to being the commander-in-chief from corporate environments like Google etc. that when you put them in a situation where they have no more power than anyone else they often get frustrated.  They can see why they are technically right, but because they have to spend so much time explaining it to others (and often the most technically adept are the least adept socially) they often end up giving an ultimatum of ""my way or the high way"".  

The reason it's important that we spend all that time to reach consensus though is so that no one man or woman can become that commander-in-chief and drown out the quieter ones.  Similar to how Jury's have to reach wide consensus in court cases in that respect since the stake - a man or woman's freedom - is often so high.  The stakes with bitcoin are *quite literally* that high when we think of all the lives (and assets) it is securing in places like Venezuela this very moment.

Finally, the other key to all this is the diversity operating to consensus creates (some 200+ devs have contributed to core).  When everyone feels they have a voice and can come in and contribute (and leave) at any time, you don't then have to worry about the commander-in-chief getting bored, having a bad day or suffering from burnout since new energy is constantly coming in to replenish the group as a whole, who are then able to pick up the slack and push good ideas everyone has agreed on forward, together.";5;0;False;smeggletoot;dlztxva;On /r/bitcoin right now.;http://i.imgur.com/CvbE7oH.png

We must come to understand that because of the success and hard work of core bitcoin itself succeeded which took that r/bitcoin community from 20,000 people when I first joined to somewhere near 300k today.  

However, the mod count hasn't gone up in line with that growth.  Many new people joining don't actually know much about the technology (bitcoin is just the new cool thing everyone is talking about) yet somehow feel they have an expert opinion that the people who built this should listen to.

It is so strange to me that LN supporters will not just admit that major downfall of LN. Everything has drawbacks and nothing is perfect. But you guys always try to come up with some excuse or deflection...

**But facts are facts...LN requires the sender, receiver and every channel/hub in between to be ONLINE.** 

LN does not innovate, IMO it goes back in time back to the dial up days where everyone had to be online and if you answered the phone the internet wouldn't work lmao. That is LN's idea of a peer to peer payment system. It is utterly hilarious that some bullshit corporation expects us to use that when we have cheap and feasible on chain transactions with Bitcoin Cash. 

Bitcoin Cash = cheap, fast, reliable payments to anywhere in the world with no middle man, no governing authority. Please explain to me how anyone would see LN, which requires you to be online to receive the payment, as a better system?

https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/48755/in-lightning-network-what-are-the-proposals-for-solutions-to-transfers-to-offli

So you can see that LN is absolutely, hilariously pathetic in terms of usability.

Also, because of the way LN is setup, it can not be decentralized. Which makes sense, if you consider that no hub can relay a transaction that is greater in value than the value of the hub itself. In other words, you need to have atleast as much money as you're relaying, locked up. 

Because you are required to hold at least the amount of funds you are relaying, only large hubs can relay large payments. Large hubs are like banks. This produces centralization. Here is a mathematical proof:

https://medium.com/@jonaldfyookball/mathematical-proof-that-the-lightning-network-cannot-be-a-decentralized-bitcoin-scaling-solution-1b8147650800

So, LN is extremely centralized by default because of the requirement of holding funds to relay them and it is outdated and redundant because of the requirement that the receiver of a payment must be online to receive the payment. 

So the corporation that is spending millions of dollars to derail the decentralized peer to peer cash aspect of Bitcoin and desperately attempting to get people to instead use the extremely shitty, redundant and outdated LN, is in for an extremely rude awakening when people just refuse to use that garbage system and instead switch to a more practical method of transferring value.

So they asked those who wanted to talk about market and price if they could form their own group.

So r/bitcoinmarkets was born.  People don't come over from bitcoin markets into r/bitcoin telling the mods they're stupid for making that rule, they've found a nice home of their own where everyone shares an interest in markets.

Yes, I know it is hard to believe that anyone would come up with such a shitty system and expect people to use it. IMO They are in for a rude awakening.

Likewise, another issue with such a system that a user brought up is that he can not add funds to cold wallets on LN. 

Sometimes users generate a pair of keys once on a safe offline machine, and use that for cold storage. Normally you can add funds to a cold wallet by simply sending a transaction to the public key. You do not need to be online or logged into anything to do this. You do not expose the keys this way, until it is time to spend.

With LN though, this doesn't work, because that is ""offline"" and won't receive the funds.

So needless to say the user was pretty upset that he won't be able to do that, I bet you he will just come to Bitcoin Cash. ";1;1;False;poorbrokebastard;dm0vgo9;On /r/bitcoin right now.;http://i.imgur.com/CvbE7oH.png

not about economics, most developers are clueless as to how the quantity of money theory impacts the value and how limiting transaction capacity laterally guarantees centralization of the network with growth.

"Yeah I love all the crazy alts, has been fun watching mad ones like MoonCoin do well and who can forget Doge? Much Wow! Such Unexpected Success! :)

In terms of being wealthy, well I worked very very hard in the early days of the internet and was lucky enough to be in the right place at the right time to found a number of startups that did very well, so getting rich with bitcoin wasn't something that held any allure, was more about solving all the very big social problems I'd been fixated on since 2010 (I basically thought the world was gonna' come to an end if good people didn't do something, so threw myself into social activism and never really left).

Any money I made from bitcoin I either used to cover basic expenses, put in non-profits I liked, or help fund friends' dream projects like record albums and the like.  Hearing your friends album play on the radio and seeing their Mum cry at the launch and knowing you played a small part in it (and bitcoin funded it) is worth more than having a bunch of money in an exchange...

The bits I have left over I wanna' put into a new internet startup in this space, which is super exciting since I've been away from coding / designing for so long and have really missed building stuff in cyberspace.

I live a very modest lifestyle and try not to stay in one place too long, although there's a place in the UK that's always where I call home...  I think the world is so big and amazing that it's a travesty some people never really get to see much of it or are afraid of the unknown...  I'm most comfortable when I can just pack everything into a rucksack and travel with my laptop.  Have managed to see 60 or more countries living that way and loved every bit of it.  You realise everyone is the same and 99.9% of humans are just incredible and beautiful once you do away with all the nonsense that artificially separates us.

It's funny, we get all worked up about money and forget, you can basically live like a King in India and Asia on the tiniest of western incomes and live an amazing life but also realise that being a King isn't that big a deal.  Cliched as it may sound, I think this wealth thing is all about what you carry in your heart.

4. You may wanna' lose WU altogether and, rather than creating a negative campaign picking on BTC, consider instead highlighting the two different use cases (store of value vs. fast micropayments).

Fortunately, bitcoin doesn't rely on reddit any more than the internet relies on W3C forums.

I think of BCH and BTC as I do RedHat and Debian - they are both trying different things with Linux and have different visions/ideas as to where it can go, and they both share good ideas and minds from the wider Linux community.  If they were fighting all the time then Linux itself would suffer as devs who are agnostic would be less likely to wanna' contribute, and as a result both RedHat and Debian would be weakened.   

As a developer about to finally start building stuff people really love using with all this I'm as excited about exploring BCH as I am LN.

> You guys censor and manipulate the narrative by deleting comments and quotes from Satoshi

I'm not ""you guys"", I'm not a mod over there and don't even use the downvote option on *anything* (though up-vote plenty).

Satoshi was the first to admit ""my word is not gospel"".  No-one's should be, and that's why 'Satoshi' recognised the importance of consensus.  Whilst I don't necessarily agree with deleting comments that don't fit the narrative, the very best way to influence that consensus is to take part in IRC meets, the dev mailing lists and submit your own [improvement proposals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bitcoin_Improvement_Proposals).  

For me the reddits aren't the best place for these things - they are for discussing and curating ideas and creating an approachable and welcoming environment for outsiders to embrace (in both camps).  

That's why r/bitcoin worked so well back in the days I did that original WU graphic - devs stuck to arguing about tech stuff behind the scenes whilst everyone on reddit got on with doing fun stuff that would help strengthen the community.

> Corporate L2 solutions

Like it or not we exist in a world run by corporations, which are really just a bunch of people working together toward a common purpose.  Some of those groups play nicer than others.  Bitpay / Bitmain / ViaBTC / Shapeshift are also corporations run by people with a vision.  Sticking the word 'corporation' in front of their ideas doesn't make those ideas evil.

As a techie, I am confident that Lightning is being run by a good bunch of people who are as excited as the rest of us about bitcoin and its tremendous capacity to change the way we measure and distribute economic energy.  I'm confident because it's been designed in such a way that they can't control the protocol level code any more than bitpay can.

The different visions from BCH and BTC are good.  It keeps everyone on our toes and ensures bad actors in this space never get to exert their authority over the wider aspirations of bitcoin - the idea.

">  It's polarized the debate

Precisely. The size debate is ultimately mostly a distraction.

The real reason for the censorship has nothing to do with block sizes, and everything to do with maintaining control of Bitcoin in a few hands. The only reason they need to resort to those harmful tactics is because they don't believe in their own abilities, and therefore have to try to artificially slant community opinions to maintain their leadership.  

All the polarization generated is by design. Pick your tribe. Pick a side. You can be with the super-smart highly effective Bitcoin Core team, or you can be with the loosely organized rag tag group of malcontents that can't even agree on one single vision for Bitcoin.

Several Core members have gone on the record saying they would ""lose interest"" in contributing to Bitcoin is they stopped having such a dominant position. And yet that's exactly what needs to happen.  
Bitcoin Core needs to become one minority player amongst many others, and discussions around how Bitcoin can evolve need to become open again. If that means losing some Core developers to get there, it's a worthwhile sacrifice.

"I think you're not looking at the bigger picture and how Bcash can actually be used as a tremendous support class under BTC.  

As a coder, I am going to strip away all the politics and look at what I've got to work with in the bright future ahead.  Right now we have two 'bitcoins' running near identical codebases  that in the future will be able to talk to each other via atomic swaps.  They both have significant investor and hashpower support and people involved have been in bitcoin since the beginning.  This is not an insignificant achievement.  

So in a years time when everything settles down, we actually have an even *stronger* bitcoin here that ethereum and other new kids on the block are going to find harder to disrupt (I also see ethereum working with LN at some juncture and all three cryptos doing amazing things together).

That makes things interesting because it allows for doing dual or triple blockchain redundancy checks on super sensitive things (such as the sale of a house).  Now when people feel safe their data can never be lost with one blockchain going down and you capture even 1% of the real estate and property market, guess what begins to happen?

At the moment all this mud throwing nonsense is highly unproductive, but whatever happens on the social network sides of this, at the end of the day it will be the code and the products built with this technology that people actually want to use that does the *real* talking.  

In that sense, just as people have no clue (or interest) in what the VISA network does behind the scenes (or intra company politics) as long as their debit card works, similarly, people will have very little interest in how Bcash / BTC / Ethereum works as long as they can rely on the LN app that enables them to secure their house sale across all three networks.

Exciting times :)

"> you weren't hostile to bch

Bcash is no more derogatory or threatening to BTC than monero or dash.  It's a group that have a different vision for bitcoin.  If we agree that hostility and dirty politics is something we don't want then we shouldn't engage in it ourselves, even if we have a different philosophy.  So I choose not to be hostile to either group and instead encourage the good people in both to stick to facts and positive, proactive action.  

We didn't make all this progress against WU and incumbents (who are now believing in this technology) by being hostile to them.  My original image wasn't hostile to WU; it merely stated facts.  Similarly, bitcoin wouldn't have gotten to where it got to had we focused any of our energy on the nonsense coming out of r/buttcoin.

If you truly want to help BTC then focus your energy on keeping that group as positive and upbeat as possible and accept that open source projects get forked and it doesn't matter what you or I would have preferred to happen because no-one has ultimate authority over the destiny of open source code.

Best we can all do is lay down arms, support and help guide good people who share our vision, and just get on with actually doing the work that will help that vision become reality.

In the end, the future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams, not those who fight against others who don't.

"Hahaha, smeggletoot here, original creator.

Yes, it's certainly a lot more slick looking than the original idea I built upon [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2mwnjk/western_union_vs_bitcoin/) (which was done in Paint I believe) :)

Still, even my first attempt at a re-work needed tweaks before the community deemed it professional enough to go out.  I would say the same of this first BCash attempt *if* you *really* want to help BCash succeed and present it in a professional light.  Which is a must if you want investors and companies to take BCH as seriously as they took the original bitcoin ad (since we worked very hard to get everything looking perfect).

With that in mind, [here's a small photoshop / branding critique](https://imgur.com/a/y3Wvp) 

1. The purple rectangles highlight the areas where your pixel alignment is a little out of place.
2. I have underlined text on the right as not sure what anti-aliasing you have used?  The font is Ubuntu which you can grab from google fonts.
3. Not sure about the lime green and hard black on cash, has Jihan or others provided any branding guidelines similar to the original bitcointalk bitcoin brand discussion that was had back in the day?
4. You may wanna' lose WU altogether and, rather than creating a negative campaign picking on BTC, consider instead highlighting the two different use cases (store of value vs. fast micropayments).  You would then more likely get both BTC (who have largest share of voice at the moment) and BCH groups giving it more oxygen on social media.
