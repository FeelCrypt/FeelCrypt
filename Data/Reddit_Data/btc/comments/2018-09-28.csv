"Almost every user here was banned from r\bitcoin for discussing bitcoin, facts about bitcoin, the history of bitcoin, or the fact that the moderators there engage in censorship and not moderation.

*Moderation* would mean the mods uphold the rule, but instead we see thousands of examples of posts and comments remove when no rules were broken if they say something that goes against the newly designed btc coin (you know, the one with full blocks and many other things that were expressly said to not be wanted in bitcoin by Satoshi), and of coruse vice versa.

At best you're a total newb who has never done any research into the facts of this matter.";2;1;False;utopiawesome;e6rrkx3;r/bitcoin mods in a nutshell ...;9jakgv;https://i.redd.it/myunj7k7aqo11.png

"lol, no alt coins rule on the sidebar doesn't jive with the hundreds of threads on litecoin

I was banned almost 2 years ago for circumventing their automoderator filter by posting the phrase ""0p3n m0derator l0gs"". That is the definition of censorship.
