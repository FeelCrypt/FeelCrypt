However, if he had responded with the evidence shortly after my request, I certainly would have been convinced it wasn't Greg, even if I couldn't definitively prove it.

Sure, but 8MB (which is a soft limit that can go up to 32 before needing another hard fork) isn't creating congestion. The point of pointing out that 1MB was arbitrary was that it was becoming a problem, and could (should) be changed. It's not like satoshi did some calculations 7 years ago and decided 1MB would be the optimal limit for the rest of Bitcoin's future.

"With so called ""zero confirmation transactions"".

Bitcoin Cash removed RBF (replace-by-fee) which was a functionality introduced in Bitcoin later on due to congestion. RBF allows you to replace a transaction you just broadcasted with another transaction with an increased fee.

Since Bitcoin Cash removed RBF, the first transaction seen by nodes is valid and any transaction trying to spend the same coins, is to be ignored.

This allows for merchants to accept a payment as soon as they see the tx broadcasted through the network (a few seconds). The merchant can kind of trust you to not double spend (e.g. move the same coins in a second tx to an address you control) because to do that you'd have to be in control of most of the nodes in the network and you'd need to be fast with this.

The chance of a double spend attack against the merchant is for tx lower than e.g. 10k USD is lower than the chance of a fraudulent charge back with a credit card.

Yeah I already did my research on Dash and by all accounts the instamine appeared to be a premeditated premine. Only people investing right now are relying on the greater fool theory. It's a bad investment. The founder still has 256,000 coins that he says he will give away 80% of for development projects but who can be sure. I don't know, he should put them in a foundation. That's still not discounting the other 1.7 million premined/instamined coins that are held by other people. The coin distribution schedule is **fucked**. It favoured very early adopters.

">It assumes that if you buy a car, that means one less car for everyone else in the world, so by not redeeming your cash for a car you are somehow loaning the value of that car (or anything else you could buy) to the world until you decide to claim it. Except cars aren't fixed resources, they're produced.
>Buying a car doesn't reduce the availability of cars, it increases it, because for every one car you buy, the manufacturer makes enough money to build 2 or 3 new cars. They can also use that money to improve their factories, which makes cars even cheaper (meaning people have even more money to buy other goods and services that generate yet more wealth).

I totally get where you're going with this. And I agree that certainly the cumulative effect of lots of similarly-situated kids experiencing a change in preferences and deciding to forego their purchase of a car would have the effect of signalling to car makers to cut back on current production.  But that just means that all of the real resources (e.g., raw materials and labor) that would have been used to manufacture those cars now remain immediately available to be used by others for either some other consumption or investment.  So I still see a ""loan"" that justifies compensation.

Also consider that if the kid had bought the car and loaned it out for the year for rental income, that also would have reduced the demand for the manufacture of new cars (the effect you describe) because the person borrowing the car would no longer need to buy one, but in that case the kid would have experienced an increase in real purchasing power.

>There is no way for it to generate value doing nothing, because there's no difference between burying money in a vault for a trillion years and just burning it.

What about this hypothetical?  An alien spaceship comes to earth and the aliens announce that they have technology that would allow us to instantly cure all human disease. And they're willing to give us this technology for some enormous amount of money representing, let's say, 10% of the global money supply. I think most people would see that as one hell of a deal. So Earth agrees. And just so we can try to avoid thinking about any redistributive effects, let's imagine that the funds can be collected from all of the world's population in perfect proportion to an individual's money holdings (so e.g., if you had $100,000 in cash and accounts, you'd contribute $10,000).

Scenario one: the aliens disappear with the cash and never return. In that case, they'd obviously have given humanity a *huge* gift. *Nominally* we'd all have less money but not in real terms, not in terms of purchasing power because everything would now be proportionally cheaper.  And we'd all get to enjoy our lives disease free and with the knowledge that all of our loved ones could now do the same. And all of the resources that currently go into the medical industry would now be freed up to produce other things of value. It would be an unimaginably massive economic boom for humanity.  

Scenario two: the aliens don't disappear and instead start spending that huge sum of money on, let's say, domestic house cats, for which they apparently have an insatiable demand. (Maybe the aliens are [Melmacians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALF_(TV_series)).) And so for maybe the next 50 years until the aliens' funds run out (for simplicity let's assume that the aliens don't engage in any further trade during this time), a significant chunk of the global economy will be devoted to breeding cats. Now we still came out ahead in this deal (that's why we agreed to it) but we're not AS well off as we were in the first scenario. Because all of the real resources that are now being devoted to breeding these hundreds of millions of house cats to ship into space on a one-way trip are no longer available to produce goods and services to satisfy human desires.

Scenario three: the aliens disappear for 50 years and *then* show back up and start spending money buying up crazy numbers of cats.  Assuming they were paid with a fixed-supply money that's increased in purchasing power, they'll probably be able to buy a lot more cats.  But that makes sense because we got to enjoy 50 years' worth of the compounded benefits of their ""loan."" As a result, humanity should now be much, much wealthier than we would have been if the aliens had never shown up.";1;1;False;Capt_Roger_Murdock;dqa8ra3;When I joined Bitcoin people were giving *discounts* for using bitcoin for purchases because the fees were less than credit card processors.

This is just kicking the can further down the road. It's still operating on a zero-sum theory of wealth.

Everything a car is made out of is also produced by people. Buying steel to make a truck doesn't make steel less available, it leads to more iron ore being mined and smelted. Trucks can also do things that make steel even more available (like transport ore). What reduces supply of steel is a reduction in demand that means people aren't willing to pay for more ore to be mined and smelted.

Even when all materials on earth have been mined, you will still be able to increase supply by recycling waste materials and mining the rest of the solar system and universe. this also ignores the vast majority of value of a car doesn't come from raw materials, but from combining them in a useful way. 

Even if some forms of wealth were zero sum, it would not make wealth zero sum so long as there were forms of wealth that weren't. We can continually increase wealth without increasing the amount of raw materials (e.g. computers today use far less material than computers 50 years ago they're just built better).

>Also consider that if the kid had bought the car and loaned it out for the year for rental income, that also would have reduced the demand for the manufacture of new cars (the effect you describe) because the person borrowing the car would no longer need to buy one, but in that case the kid would have experienced an increase in real purchasing power.

If the kid bought the car then the car company would still have the money to build more cars and so it would be cheaper for the next guy to buy a car. The kid buying a car and trying to rent it would not force anyone to rent a car who wanted to buy one. Only someone who wanted to rent a car anyway would rent a car instead of buying it. The rental market is not separate from the buying market. Even if there was only one person in the world who owned cars and rented them to everyone else, they would still have to buy cars to meet demand. 

Renting cars can actually generate wealth because there are times when it will be very inefficient to buy a whole car when you only need it for a short time. Rentals allow a greater amount of value from the same amount of resources (i.e. wealth generation). 12 guys who each need a car for 1 month are making much more efficient use of resources if they rent 1 car rather than buy 12 separate cars that then don't see much use. The money they save on not buying a whole car can be used to buy other goods and services, which generates more wealth.

This hypothetical does not show wealth being generated from doing nothing with money. 

The scenario would be no different if the aliens just showed up and asked us to burn 10% of the money supply in exchange for this technology. The wealth has already been generated and is being gifted in either case.

It's not really a good hypothetical because there is nothing stopping us from just printing all the money back again. you'd have to say ""the aliens wouldn't give us the technology unless we agreed not to increase the money supply"", so then you're not really asking whether deflation has any benefits, but whether some super valuable technology is worth the economic damage that sharp deflation would cause.

The only value being generated by money is in the scenario where the only way we get this fantastic wealth generating technology is by trading it.

>Now we still came out ahead in this deal (that's why we agreed to it) but we're not AS well off as we were in the first scenario. Because all of the real resources that are now being devoted to breeding these hundreds of millions of house cats to ship into space on a one-way trip are no longer available to produce goods and services to satisfy human desires.

We're not as well off in a situation where we're gifted great wealth than when we have to pay for it. That's a given. That would be the case whether we were required to pay money or sacrifice half the worlds population or launch all the worlds gold into the sun.

We're only worse off in comparison to a hypothetical where we're gifted wealth. If the aliens added all this extra wealth to the economy then that is in addition to the existing wealth, its not coming at the expense of other parts of the economy. There's no overall loss because any wealth that got dedicated to cat breeding is additional to all the wealth the new tech generates.

>Scenario three: the aliens disappear for 50 years and then show back up and start spending money buying up crazy numbers of cats. Assuming they were paid with a fixed-supply money that's increased in purchasing power, they'll probably be able to buy a lot more cats. But that makes sense because we got to enjoy 50 years' worth of the compounded benefits of their ""loan.""

And if we had printed quadrillions of that money and they came back, then it would be worthless by the time they came back. Would that somehow prove that what they had given us with worthless?

The intuition that money is ""deserve"" tokens and so that any increase in the value of tokens must mean you have done something to ""deserve"" it is a faulty assumption that's going to lead to all kinds of faulty conclusions even if your logic is correct.

In this case its leads to the idea that not taking up resources is somehow a form of generating wealth. Which is not the case, otherwise killing yourself is a tremendous act of wealth generation since you're freeing up all the resources you would use in your life.

The supply and demand for money is separate from wealth generation. Double the amount of money or half it and you have not changed the amount of wealth in the world, you have only changed the relative value of each unit of money, which creates no value in itself except for how it encourages value generating behavior. Hoarding a token that only has use to facilitate trade does not generate any value, it only results in zero-sum transfers.

If aliens came and took every single dollar in the world, we would not lose any wealth except for the very small amount of wealth in the form of paper. We could print all that money back again and be no worse off than before. Money != wealth.

"I agree with you on matters of principle, Bitcoin Segwit is a fork away from the original Satoshi Nakamoto Bitcoin; it should have been a stand-alone experiment (Bitcoin Segwit - BTS maybe) as it deliberately reassigns incentives and changes the game-theory rules at play. 

However, I won’t demonize the word “fork” and I’m absolutely ok with using it. While I believe there will eventually be one ecosystem and the network effect will allow for only one currency to prevail, and undoubtedly it’s Satoshi’s Bitcoin (Bitcoin Cash); competition is a good thing. 

Competition will allow to solve those edge use cases where bitcoin won’t compete (e.g., paranoid and extreme transaction privacy). Forks will allow for new and imaginative solutions to problems we didn’t even consider yet. But each fork should be a stand-alone fork with very honest and transparent playbooks (no pre-mining bullshit) and not and try to hijack the original Bitcoin design like BTC/Core/AXA/Banks tried to do. 

Forking is ok, it’s healthy, and Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Core forked from each other as to prevent the Segwit poison pill from being swallowed by Satoshi’s Bitcoin.

"A lot can be gleaned about the inner workings of Core based on what topics are allowed or disallowed on /r/bitcoin. The censorship there is so thorough that nothing even slips through the cracks... If you see something on /r/bitcoin, it's because someone wanted you to see it, or at the very least decided it was ok for you to see it.

/r/bitcoin disallows all talk about coins with actual scalability solutions (like ETH or BCH) but allows talking about coins with the segwit cancer (LTC, VTC) and their infinite new number of forks (Bitcoin Gold, Bitcoin Diamond, Bitcoin Clashic, Bitcoin CashPlus, Bitcoin Extreme).

What this tells me is that Bitcoin Core [used here to mean the wider apparatus, not just the developers] doesn't actually believe that hard forks or big blocks are dangerous, in the end all it comes down to is whether they are in control or not.

- open source ahead of fork time?

- reviewed by fork time?

- at least _some_ accountable devs or real people willing to support it?

- no outright stupid technical claims?

- no false attribution / dressing yourself with false endorsements?

">If your plan is to do nothing and allow the welfare system to collapse under its own weight then congratulations - you've just doomed the native populations to die like the Boers

Yes, that is the plan and I think it will happen sooner than many people even here think. The government's grip on the hearts and minds of its subjects is faltering and their financial position is increasingly tenuous.

However, collapse doesn't have to be that disorderly. As long as there is something waiting in the wings to take over when the legacy system crumbles the West will do just fine.

"**Rumspringa**

Rumspringa (Pennsylvania German pronunciation: [rəmˈsprɪŋə], Pennsylvania Dutch: [rʊmˈʃprɪŋə]), also spelled Rumschpringe or Rumshpringa, is a term for a rite of passage during adolescence, translated in English as ""jumping/hopping around"", used in some Amish and Mennonite communities. The Amish, a subsect of the Anabaptist Christian movement, intentionally segregate themselves from other communities as a part of their faith. For Amish youth, the Rumspringa normally begins around the age of 14 to 16 and ends when a youth chooses baptism within the Amish church, or instead leaves the community. For Wenger Mennonites, Rumspringa occurs between ages 16 and 21.

Of course all the subsidies need to end and the government needs to shrink. It's not possible to do this however without increasing border controls first.

The people who come in for subsidies vote for more subsidies. That's why governments stole from taxpayers to import them in the first place. Until you cut off the flow of new voters for welfare, it's not going to be possible to end it.

"> but state-enforced immigration restrictions

This is the worst kind of strawman argument.

We are not living in a generally free society where the government just decided to add some immigration restrictions.

Governments are taxing their subjects and using that money to pay for the mass importation of a hostile population. Then they use anti-discrimination laws to force their subjects to interact with this populating under pain of fines and jail. The new population is de facto immune to being held accountable for violations of civil and criminal law, yet especially in Europe the full force of law is brought down on anyone who speaks out about what is happening.

In any other time in history this would be called an invasion and would represent a great opportunity for libertarians and anarchists to actually exercise all their theories of non-state defense.

Nope. Bitcoin Cash has bigger blocks and is committed to scaling on chain. If BCH has the same amount of transactions as BTC it wouldn't blink and LTC would suffer the same issues as BTC. If blocks become full before another solution is found (say that LN works) then BCH will just increase the block size further. In addition BCH has more people who own it because it is a Bitcoin fork. Finally BCH has FAR greater market cap which means it is more useful for people who want to move great sums of money than Litecoin (although admittedly these people wouldn't care about fees and can use BTC instead);2;0;False;Eirenarch;dq9ylqa;Jeffrey A Tucker: “I'm thinking that the critics of BCH are not looking good.

If they were actually serious about their alleged principles, they would have recognized the movement as a growing market demand for a restoration of covenant communities - a form of social organization that allows people to choose their neighbors freely and does not violate the non-aggression principle.

They could have gotten out in front of that social movement and shown everyone how libertarian principles could peacefully give them what they looked for and the would have won over the next two generations of the youth to their movement.

Instead of doing this, however, they succumbed to social pressure and demands from the think tank donors and started slandering and shaming people for having preferences.

We’re real and we’re trying to help you. I hope your alt coin goes up and up and stays there. More value in cryptocurrency is a great thing. But Bitcoin Cash is a corporate, centralized alt coin. It’s not the real thing. I’m not saying it’s not useful or valuable, it’s just not Bitcoin. It’s philosophically different and it’s not why a lot of us are here.  ;-22;4;False;iamnosent;dq9pd9x;Jeffrey A Tucker: “I'm thinking that the critics of BCH are not looking good.

My guess is that Bitcoin will rocket up and BCH will not tank, but just lose some value due to the increase in Bitcoin. When BCH forked I sold all of mine at .14 with no plans on buying back. Once I saw how well BCH started doing I bought back in and will hold both.

"This is a fantastic question that I'm unsure of. 

I do know that Litecoin has 4x the number of coins as BTC. My research also shows that the director of engineering of Coinbase.com created LTC. I wonder if there's other articles that give better backstories on the origins.

Thanks for your response. But BCH is a relatively new coin and LTC is old. It seems more like “BTC is too slow and costly let’s fork it and make it better instead of use LTC.”  I guess I’m not well versed enough to understand why BCH is so much better than an existing coin that seems innovative and fast to me when I’ve used it. I understand it doesn’t have the same load as BTC so can’t be exactly compared. ;2;3;False;isit2amalready;dq9pb8s;Jeffrey A Tucker: “I'm thinking that the critics of BCH are not looking good.
