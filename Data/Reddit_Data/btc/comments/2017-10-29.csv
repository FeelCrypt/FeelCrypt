False, SegWit the bullshit ""Scaling solution"" Blockstream Core have been misleading everyone for over a year, usage fell 50% within a week and the mempool is still clogged, fee is still high, confirmation is still slow.

So technically they fucking failed, this make Blockstream Core ""experts"" at failing.

Blockstream Core are also economic retards, killing Bitcoin's network effect with 1MB so it can scale in the far future? Give me a fucking break.

Don't tell bullshit like ""2MB is just kicking the can down the road"" while merchants are quitting using Bitcoin because of the high fee due to 1MB.

**Bitcoin is an economic invention, stop talking like an economic retard.**

We have the hardware and bandwidth to handle 8MB, this is proven by Bitcoin Cash, there's no excuse to kill Bitcoin's immediate growth with sticking with 1MB. If you don't understand this, then you don't understand economics, in which case you should just shut the fuck up instead of regurgitating Core's bullshit like a dumb fuck typewriter monkey.

Just stfu and switch to 2MB and keep working on future scaling.

People are already working on 1G blocks. If scaling is too difficult for Blockstream Core, then they should just fuck off and let better people handle scaling.

Even the Blockstream idiots agreed going to 8MB-100MB was the obvious path forward, before they got pwned by bankers.

"> Core will raise max blocksize when needed

It was needed two years ago.

>but then we might start seeing lots of new services pop up that are basically spam or not important.

This is central planning of what should be left to the market, the antithesis of bitcoin.

The real point here is miners did control the maximum blocksize they would mint. That control was taken away by blockstream central planning. 

The entire purported reason of restricting the blocksize was to protect miners from being outpaced and thus centralized, yet they had the tools all along to set the blocksize at what they wanted and the economic incentive to buy faster internet/hardware.

Then the argument shifted that high node running requirements would damage decentralization, claiming non-mining nodes would be harmed beyond their charitable will to operate. This is incorrect for two reasons, one is that non-mining full nodes perform a tertiary role in merely fact-checking the miners, not the primary role of being the network. The other reason is that businesses in the cryptospace that aren't miners will run full nodes for their own self-interested reasons and be a sufficient voice against miners.

"GREAT link.  That's something that seems often forgotten- now that we pretty much all agree full blocks make for a shitty Bitcoin experience (because we know from experience that Bitcoin sucks when blocks are full), everybody's forgotten that many Core devs were (a year or so ago) constantly saying full blocks are the way things should be *all the time*.  

In hindsight it should have seemed obvious that having an inelastic supply with elastic demand will mean huge fluctuations in price as demand goes up and down past the supply point.  With all respect for Core devs, I think some of them fancy themselves economists but without much understanding of economics.

"I would argue these discussions have been ongoing for close to 3 years now. Core has already discussed and backed up their stance on the matter with studies or facts by experts in the area. It’s been debated and afaik they have chosen the most technically correct path to move forward. The problem is the issues get brought up again and again and again. This creates a never ending argument and stagnation. After years of this they needed to fight back... This is why I believed the censorship began (to reduce noise). It’s hard to tell if this has been effective or not. They did get segwit pushed but it’s not s done deal yet given x2 is a huge threat (gives garzik control of codebase). Either way what’s done is done. I don’t believe in censorship but they are trying to build something here and let’s be real malicious actors such as Jihan are opposing them with propaganda and hash power. Core is planning for final solution / long term and miners are interested in keeping their control and short term profits. Then we have Ver who probably feels entitled to his opinion because he’s been around longer than probably anyone but isn’t being realistic with only supporting on chain transactions. it doesn’t matter what anyone says, keeping track of every single transaction in the ledger makes zero sense and micro payments over the internet has enormous potential. Core will raise max blocksize when needed but is paving the way for how bitcoin will be used in a way. For example we could easily raise the limit and lower fees but then we might start seeing lots of new services pop up that are basically spam or not important. They only want real money transactions on the chain. These other services can however be built on the second layer and will be much more efficient. All we are really waiting for is the development to happen. After then I think we will see bitcoin stock go way up as people understand how much utility second layer has. So if everyone stopped trying to change bitcoin and let development continue we would be that much closer to unlocking the next big thing for blockchain. 

Yes this is unproven at this point but in theory it can work. Also most experts in this field agree and are currently working on it. Compare this to the other side, big blockers... it doesn’t even scale unless you get up to massive block sizes and low fees. Given that you will still need to wait for confirmations which will never work for everyday purchases. All these transactions will then be recorded on the blockchain forever which makes the system more and more inefficient the further you get down the road. Add in bigger blocks = less decentralization and it really doesn’t sound like a good idea at all.

Proven facts:

1) Blockstream Core control the commit access to the default Bitcoin client, they're directly responsible for keeping blocks at 1MB, that's why Core will be fired in November.

2) Economic majority and hash power majority is overwhelmingly supporting 2MB, Core is the only relevant party insisting on sticking to 1MB, that is why Core has to be fired in November for Bitcoin to move forward.

3) Bitcoin's market share dropped from 90% to below 50% after block size reaches 1MB and fee began to rise, so Core is directly responsible for giving rise to alt-coins.

Again, prove me wrong or shut the fuck up.

Wtf is wrong with you. That guy is just regurgitating the Blockstream Core script, and clearly lacks basic economic and technical background to see the obvious bullshit, or he's just paid to act dumb.

How the fuck do you justify killing Bitcoin's immediate growth with sticking to 1MB? When the blocks are already full? What the fuck is wrong with 2MB?

This is Blockstream Core's argument: ""We can't scale to 1billion users by keep increasing the blocksize, so we have to stick to 1MB and make merchants quit using Bitcoin now!!!!!!""

Bullshit is bullshit, stop sugar coating it.

How should it have been handled? There is no perfect solution but yes I agree core does have lots of control and we are kind of trusting them but it’s open source after all and devs typically do follow the best code commited. Btw segwit was supposed to get implemented long ago but miners had been blocking it. Who blocked what first. Miners e segwit or core with x2... theres not 1 party to blame. This whole situation is a mess but for some reason core gets all the blame. You don’t see core using millions of dollars to fork and solely mine an unprofitable coin / spread propaganda to hurt the opposing side. Core hasn’t decided to create an altcoin. Like I said before, this is a giant witch hunt against core and for some reason all the other actors get a pass.. something to think about before you go and endorse China coin and Jihan. ;2;1;False;Halperwire;dp2e7lg;Block the Stream: a censorship-driven, artificial network constraint to drive demand for LN;https://i.imgur.com/8nUPVvV.jpg

"I completely agree about 8MB and the point about it just being another, slightly bigger dam. I'm actually not against off-chain solutions, and the pragmatist in me says that they'll be needed in the long run.

However, Blockstream's approach of negating discussion around immediate scaling needs, or describing everything different as an 'attack' is not a constructive way to getting there. The reality is that Bitcoin's failure to meet scaling requirements creates forks and altcoins, because the technical community responds to that market demand, and provides. Their position of opposition to those developments, and their influence in the Western social media, has significantly brought down the quality of discussion in the Bitcoin community.

"> Segwit makes signature data cheaper. That means the network is subsidizing Segwit transactions. Since the data still needs to be stored and transmitted it should cost the same as other transactions.

Again, this was the only backwards-compatible way of increasing capacity. Hardforks should be avoided if possible. Why is it bloat though? It encodes transaction data, the only thing different is the accounting.
