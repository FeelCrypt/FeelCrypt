"Well it is a systemic problem: the system. I has a hard limit that would have made it obsolete 15 years ago if it was the primary mean of electronic payment used by then. BCH is just pushing the limit further, it would have been obsolete 14 years ago. If you raise the limit to a few GBs it may handle the scale we need, but it's gonna be obsolete soon. 

I pulled these numbers out of my ass but the point is that bitcoin has never been and will not be in its current form able to handle even a fraction of human needs for electronic payments, and bitcoin cash helps so little, it would be able to handle a bigger fraction of these, but still a ridiculously small one.

"I clearly don't know what I'm talking about. Despite a CS degree and a few months diving into the tech I still have lots of dark spots in my understanding, I cannot deny that. 

That being said, I still grasp a few things and am able to do some basic logical reasoning. I clearly oversimplified by using the term infinity. What I meant is we need the network to be able to handle a number of transactions significantly higher than our need, if we want to keep transactions on chain and hope to see bitcoin democratized while remaining decentralized. 

I find 2 transactions a month per human is ridiculously low compared to what we do in practice. If that's the future of bitcoin I highly doubt that bitcoin will hold any kind of privileged place in the space of electronic payments. We're talking about a GB block size that our hardware currently can't handle (a mid range hardware cannot upload GBs in a matter of seconds in 99% of the world), for a transaction rate far to low for our need.

I understand that we need to explore all possibilities in this space. I see BCH as a good thing that happened to bitcoin core - a possible future being explored and tested out. A quick and temporary improvement in the wait for a long term solution.

I don't see how this could be a long term solution tho. Why are people so confident that this is the perfect system that should only be tweaked but not structurally improved, whereas its reaching its limits while still being underused compared to traditional electronic means of payment by at least 10 thousands folds?

"I can't agree. Internet saw new usages develop as the network scaled up. There was no alternative to the internet. Transferring information was going from pain to ease. 

Bitcoin already has its uses, but can't handle the scale by orders of magnitude. There is plenty of alternatives to bitcoin (with some huge players in the field already, thinking about visa, PayPal, western union, and plenty of smaller ones such as the altcoins). If bitcoin scalability isn't fixed some other tech will take its place as primary mean of transfer of value. It just won't scale in its current state, and if it doesn't, people will use something that does. 

People won't go from ease to pain when. It comes to the transfer of value. People won't wait for hardware to become orders of magnitudes cheaper and more powerful just to do what they can already do today very easily. If you think they will, I would be curious to know what makes you think that.

"Here are some thoughts, since you ask. _(And for this first part, a disclaimer: I am not a lawyer; these are just my thoughts)._

When a company creates software, they are merely _authors_ of a copyrighted work, and there is a right to **free speech.**

But when that company issues units of a _""convertible virtual currency""_ FINCEN might say that the company meets the definition of a _""virtual currency administrator.""_ And if the company then sells those units, FINCEN might say the company is therefore also a _money transmitter_ – and if the company is not licensed to do that (in all 50 states) then they may be an **unlicensed money transmitter,** especially if the company is not identifying the purchasers of those units and verifying that they really are not US persons.

This gives FINCEN an opening for enforcement, and it then becomes a **legal remedy** for the company in question to form a _compliance department,_ to show a _good faith effort,_ and to build KYC/AML features into their product itself (such as the ability to _""freeze funds from afar""_ etc). Again, this could not initially be enforced against mere free speech, but rather, the camel's head enters the tent by targeting the issuance and sale of tokens.

In this way, the sale of tokens becomes the _""Wide gate and broad path that leads to destruction, and many walk it.""_

Note that this issue is entirely separate from any potential SEC issues, CFTC issues, IRS issues, etc. But I think it's the most important one, and Ripple may be a good example of what can happen.

-----------

Some other Ripple-related thoughts for your perusal:

-- I do not personally hold any XRP.

-- I have always been a fan of Ryan Fugger's original concept, and always felt it was important, since it represents a mechanism allowing money to change form along trust paths formed **friend-to-friend,** and also because it allows people (in theory) to enter and exit the network entirely through their friends (versus having to use some regulated 3rd party business). I still think future solutions are coming that exploit this _""friends and family""_ concept.

-- I am friendly with Arthur Britto (co-founder of Ripple) and was in conversations with him before the company was founded. I wish them the best of luck and am happy for their continued success. (Good on them).

This whole sector is so new, and has so much room yet to grow, and there is so much to be done, and so much that has not yet even happened – it's still so early! Everyone should be friendly with each other and realize that ultimately what's coming will be driven by fundamental properties of the new technology and of human nature. **Natural market forces.** That is a compass for how things will go.

PROOF OF WORK IS **KEY**

-- The appearance of the Bitcoin blockchain was like fire from the gods. **Prometheus.** An historic invention, solving a problem previously considered unsolvable, and making many new applications possible, which will impact society profoundly as they are rolled out in coming years.  **Proof of work** is the lynchpin that makes it possible.

-- Proof-of-work is important because it allows anyone from the public to process transactions, even anonymously, _without_ compromising the integrity of the ledger. Without proof-of-work, this would not be possible; you would need some kind of more centralized control over who gets to be a validator, and who does not. When the Stellar ledger forked, we saw IMO what can go wrong in a _""distributed ledger""_ that lacks proof-of-work. This I fear is the biggest problem with Ripple today, though it may not be a problem for them anyway, depending on their **business plans.**

-- I myself have even created a ""distributed ledger"" system (unreleased) that eschews proof-of-work, purely for the exercise of doing it. My conclusion was that it _is_ possible to create a distributed ledger without PoW that ""works"" in the conventional sense (in normal operation) but it is _not secure._ The problems that arise are not in the normal functioning of the system, _per se,_ but rather, in dealing with the various **attacks.** It's when you try to solve the attacks that you find the solution always pointing back to **proof-of-work.**

-- When I went through this exercise, I ended up with a system based on 2-parts: the initial signed transaction request, followed by the confirmation. I was able to prototype it quickly by using Open-Transactions as a financial crypto library. In between the request and the confirmation, I ended up using a series of **iterative rounds** for the validators so that they would validate any transactions that passed through a series of rounds. The first round required 50% of surrounding validators to approve, followed by 60%, then 70%, then 80%. _(I didn't originally plan to use iterative rounds, BTW, but working through the exercise eventually led me in that direction)._ I realized at that point that the project was becoming more and more similar to what Ripple had built. I even started checking their wiki to see how they had addressed various problems I was working through. I eventually dropped the project, but it was a very useful thought exercise for me. It was what finally made me realize the true importance of **proof-of-work.**

-- Bitcoin works IMO (and I originally got this from Daniel Krawisz) due to the **Handicap Principle,** which is seen over and over again in Nature. I view proof-of-work as almost a physical limit. (Sort of like the **speed of light).** Not exactly, of course, but you get the idea. The ""costliness"" of Bitcoin _is_ what secures it.  And it's not even that costly, really, for the security and ""open public operation"" gained in return. Implemented correctly, mining fees are extremely low in comparison to the legacy payment alternatives that Bitcoin is disrupting. The competition of miners, and the mechanism of difficulty adjustments, work together to ensure that in the long term, fees will end up as low as theoretically possible, not much above electricity, and just enough to keep the miners in business. (If following Satoshi's vision).

Bitcoin really is a phenomenal invention, even more than most yet realize. Many think Bitcoin has problems like the _""51% attack""_ or the _""wasted electricity""_ but that thinking merely betrays a lack of understanding about what's really amazing about Bitcoin, and what a _solution_ it really is.

But that's okay, and is to be expected. Financial cryptography is extremely difficult to understand, and even many financial cryptographers (and goldbugs, and economists) missed the boat on Bitcoin entirely. It will only be through its ongoing operation into the future, and various forks, and continued disruption in society, and what ends up working in the real world, that eyes will finally be opened more fully to the implications of this technology.";3;0;False;fellowtraveler;drzf4ht;Okay, this Ripple shit is ridiculous.

"> I highly doubt people are going to go to the store and scroll through a list

Well, actually they will  - not going ""through the list"", it seems like an exaggeration - but paying with their cryptocurrency of choice, if it will be more benefitting for them than paying with the credit card.

Examples could be:
a) privacy (unanimous payment)
b) economic stability (especially in the countries with high inflation rate)
c) convenience (if i received a cryptopayment from abroad i can straight away use and transaction can take seconds/minutes, depending on the blockchain/coin)

And so on. Besides micropayments (""for coffee""), there is also cross-border payments market.

And besides payments there is also miriad of different uses for the crypto - starting from smart contracts and ending with solar power trading.

Spot on dude. In the end, it's a big world out there and there's room for many crypto projects.

"> A blockchain is a database, and nothing more.

What? Nothing more? I am not sure you're trolling or just havent understood what bitcoin is. Read the friggin white paper now. Please. It's six pages FFS.  A blockchain qcgieves trustless distributed consensus through proof of work. That is a huge deal. A game changer. It's the opposite of 'nothing more'.

> There's nothing wrong with running a private SQL database.

Of course not. But it is what it is. And whomever owns it cab do whatever with it. You have to trust that one entity. If you don't understand why this undermines the whole point of a strong and secure currency, I'm afraind its no use explaining it anyway.

> Well what about an improved private database secured with cryptography. It may not be immutable, but one could combine the trust in the company with the trust in cryptography to have a reason to use that private database over a standard SQL database. SQL databases don't have cryptographic integrity.

It's not secured with cryptography because whomever owns it also owns the checksums, hashes or whatever pseudo-security you're talking about. Integrety can be easily achieved without cryptography and proper relational database systems have been doing it for 40 years.

A blockchain is just a data structure which enables the possibility of securing data immutability through rewards for proofs of work. If you remove proof of work,  iy becomes useless.  If you want to chrck the integrety of a blob just use a checksum like it has been done for decades.";0;2;False;observerc;drzr4sp;Okay, this Ripple shit is ridiculous.

What makes Bitcoin decentralized?

Decentralization is one of Bitcoin's main selling points. But what does it actually mean? Skip to the end for the tl;dr

**What is centralization**    
As we all know from reading everything Satoshi wrote about his design for Bitcoin from satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org, Bitcoin was finalized and born in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. In this event many normal people lost money while banking executives made more and more. 

**Where does centralization come from**       
These banks, much like the bank you probably use today, are centralized. That is, they alone control everything that happens. There is one database which has everyone's funds, if they decide you are a terrorist or something they can stop you from access your money. They can stop you from making transactions. Even if you have done nothing wrong they can stop payment on your transactions without your consent, lock you out of your funds, and monitor everything you do. 


**What  is decentralization**       
By splitting up the 'power' that a bank has we decentralize it. There is no longer any one single entity that can control txs and funds. This way no one is 'in charge' and no one can give themselves bonuses while other people lose money. This decentralization is a founding point of Bitcoin.

**Where does decentralization come from**       
Instead of one company controlling the database of funds like in the centralized model, in Bitcoin's decentralized model there are many people who can all contribute to the database and transaction processing without any one entity having full control. In Bitcoin and other POW based cryptocurrencies this decentralization is achieved by having a number of *mining nodes* who are not affiliated. As long as no group of miners controls more than 51% of the hashpower, bitcoin remains decentralized.

---


**So only mining nodes contribute to decentralization, then what about non-mining nodes**      
Non-mining nodes, full nodes, relay nodes, or storage nodes are often misunderstood to be part of decentralization. This can be easily cleared up by understanding the above information and then understanding that a non-mining node has no *power* if the majority of hashpower were to do something they didn't like. 

**I thought everyone was supposed to run a full node**      
This is another common misunderstanding, in the very beginning Satoshi did intend for everyone to run a node with 4 functions. He is very clear when he explains how this is not the way for the system to function in the future. The plan of bitcoin is that everyone can make trustless peer-to-peer transactions on a decentralized system. Not that everyone would run a home server with the whole blockchain. The business and bitcoin companies that need to have personal and instant validation of their tx can run a full nodes. Random sampling is a tried and trusted method, those unable to host their own relay node would be easily able to verify their transactions with overwhelming mathematically certainty.

**So who wants to run a full node then**     
Anyone who wants to can, it's like the Olympics, 'anyone can compete but few feel the need to'. There is no reason the network should be ground to a halt and made useless so people who can't afford to make a transaction would be able to run a full node on a 20 year old computer over a dial up connection. Bitcoin was meant to scale with technology, not become left behind. 


**What are the 4 functions that all early nodes did**       
When you read the design of Bitcoin which we all invested into, the design on which so much was built, the one at nakamotoinstitute.org, you see Satoshi mention the word 'node' many times. What we today call a full node or non-mining node usually fulfills one of those functions, that of storing the database. Finding other peers for connecting to is done by full nodes and pool operators. Sending and receiving bitcoin, aka a wallet, was also a function every node had. Finally generating coins by putting new transactions into the blockchain was the 4th thing all nodes used to do. Today these 4 actions are largely compartmentalized, as they should be in any good computer science project.

---


This is Bitcoin, some people are unhappy with the way Bitcoin was designed, well I suppose Bitcoin is simply not for those people and they should maybe find something else to do.


I hope you've all learned something today about how Bitcoin is decentralized, what is means, and how we got there.

tl;dr Banks control all txs and accounts with one database and are centralized, Bitcoin has many miners who perform this actions to make it decentralized. Non-mining nodes don't contribute to decentralization. ";1;0;False;siir;ds06gg5;Bitcoin: this is fine!;https://imgur.com/a/cFWFw

As for why they are still begging for it today, it is because it is way late getting here because of greed and power plays.  We should have been here two years ago and we would have been if it wasn't for the greed and power plays.

It's not about adding anything to BCH, LN is it's own software using Bitcoin's existing smart contracts. If people want to use LN on BCH then BCH either needs to add segwit or someone needs to write a version of LN software that doesn't use segwit. You can not take existing LN software and use it on BCH out of the box, it won't work.

"Mmn, that is a complication.  They may have developed this already, IDK, but my guess is that it'd narrow it down to an appropriately small size of potential routes and then basically do a traceroute along each of them to find viable and optimal paths.  If ""privacy"" includes the potential transmitter not knowing the balance to be *sent*, that sounds next to impossible, but if it's just not having to disclose how much is in the channel, and they could just return a confirmation as to whether or not they can route it, I think that would work.

"LN is not a scaling solution.  Lightning Network has major problems.  For one it has been [proven to be centralized](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6jqrub/game_over_blockstream_mathematical_proof_that_the/). As [Jiang Zhouer says](https://cointelegraph.com/news/chinese-exchange-huobi-asks-bitcoin-core-expert-to-address-scaling-issues):

> “LN [Lightning] will nurture monopoly LN processor like Alipay or Wechat Pay. By that time, the government could easily shut down the LN in the name of AML. Then the LN transaction will be transferred to the 1M mainnet, the 100x transaction demand will jam the network and soon the network will be paralyzed as well.”

The narrative about malleability and the need for LN was also a [complete false narrative and Bitfury created Lightning Network without segwit or malleability fix](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6qgngo/here_is_proof_that_segwit_is_not_needed_for/).

"**Quantum teleportation**

Quantum teleportation is a process by which quantum information (e.g. the exact state of an atom or photon) can be transmitted (exactly, in principle) from one location to another, with the help of classical communication and previously shared quantum entanglement between the sending and receiving location. Because it depends on classical communication, which can proceed no faster than the speed of light, it cannot currently be used for faster-than-light transport or communication of classical bits. While it has proven possible to teleport one or more qubits of information between two (entangled) atoms, this has not yet been achieved between molecules or anything larger.

Segwit was activated back in August 2017

If it was wanted - why is r/bitcoin still begging people to adopt it now - near Jan 2018 (almost 5 months from when it was activated).

Doesn't this imply that not everyone wanted it?

Also, if you're correct and it wasn't snuck in, then why wasn't a hard fork done? Could it be that the developers knew that there was no support for it at that time, as evident by people still begging for it now?

>As to the voters, what is preventing me from selecting my second self (sybil) as the representative that monitors my blocks? 

Again, representatives don't monitor the blocks of individual people, they are called upon to vote to choose a transaction whenever _any_ node detects a double spend. Nodes are following every transaction they see.

It's not a case of being PoS, it's a consequence of not having any sort of mining or staking. There's no process of distributing the coins over time that makes sense for Raiblocks design. 

>The voting system does look interesting though, choosing a representative to monitor your own blocks, but it seems there could be some security concerns still in this regarding double spending.

The representatives don't monitor your blocks, they are called upon to vote whenever any node detects a double spend, so that they can decide what transaction to keep.

Also what is way worse is the amount of uneconomically spendable coins and pricing everybody except the wealthy out of being a Bitcoin user.";38;2;False;theantnest;drzku5j;Charlie Shrem on Bitcoin Last Year;https://i.redd.it/9hwtywe8m5701.jpg

"Charlie was very pro-onchain scaling in early 2017, and during this time he became very active in the Dash community (which also embraces onchain scaling - remember, this was before the BCH Fork). He made a proposal to the Dash Budget System for a Dash-branded debit card, it passed, and he receive the funds.

Shortly after it passed (very shortly!), he changed his tune and became a vocal Core apologist. He stopped communicating with the Dash community, his debit card project fizzled, and he basically became persona non grata there.

Any wallet app with qr code reader and bch support will do. I just mentioned Coinomi as a recommendation Specially for merchants.

About the fees:

* Network fees are needed every time you send crypto coins as payment to the network miners who processes your transactions.

* Fees can be set by the customer (i.e. 5k SATs, 10k SATs, etc.)

* For microtransactions, its ok for customers to set fees to zero. Network miners will not mind it. ;-)

* Merchants don't care about fees, they just want to get paid. ;-)";1;0;False;BitcoinKantot;drz5znu;True winning is not about the coin price.
