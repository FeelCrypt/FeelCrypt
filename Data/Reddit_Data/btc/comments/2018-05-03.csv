Agreed. Bitcoin Cash is far better in terms of being progressive technologically. But it's the image that the Bitcoin Cash community presents that is so toxic. Roger Ver is a poor representative for the project, and the attempt to hijack the Bitcoin name is counterproductive. If Bitcoin cash is so great, then allow the people to come.

"**Blind men and an elephant**

The parable of the blind men and an elephant originated in the ancient Indian subcontinent, from where it has been widely diffused. It is a story of a group of blind men, who have never come across an elephant before and who learn and conceptualize what the elephant is like by touching it. Each blind man feels a different part of the elephant body, but only one part, such as the side or the tusk. They then describe the elephant based on their partial experience and their descriptions are in complete disagreement on what an elephant is.

No, that is not what I'm saying.

I'm saying that you should find your place, your movement and your meaning.
Attempting to ""be"" Bitcoin is not going to succeed. And it's making a lot of people angry at you, which is most likely contra-productive.

Basically, your slogan should be ""Bitcoin cash is _not_ Bitcoin"", because ""Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin"" has already angered a lot of people, and you'll just continue to disenfranchise yourself with the greater crypto community and economy.  
Do you understand what the OP is about?

This is why I asked you if you had any idea how forks work in a free market.  Because again, your comment indicates you don't.  

This isn't something we're just ""choosing to do"".  Its a fork.  The entire purpose of a fork is to redirect the original project down another path, when the existing path is not agreeable to a large % of people.  

So ""taking the name"" is a default premise.  Its not a choice.  And nobody cares if ""its making people angry"".   *It made us angry that Blockstream came in and crippled Bitcoin so they could profit off its transaction volumes.   That's why we forked.  And on a moral level Im pretty fucking solid in the assessment that this was a corrupt, inappropriate thing for them to do.*

But this isn't some random alt coin trying to copycat.   ***This is Bitcoin, going another direction***.   Will it get the name eventually?   The market will decide.  Not you.  Not me.  Not Roger.   And there won't be a damn thing any of us can do about it.

At this point, given your assumptions and stated criteria, I can see why you draw the conclusions you do. Yet, your statement above is self-evidently incorrect: Given the existence of the BCH chain, this sub, many developers, this thread, and users like myself, it seems obvious that consensus is *still* forming.

I don't know how things will play out. But it is possible for the BCH chain to pass the BTC chain in proof of work in the future. If that happens, then your criteria would cause you to ""switch chains"".

As for the ""Bitcoin.com"" and @bitcoin twitter handle, I couldn't care less. Bitcoin.com had links to bitcoin.org, right? I think it would be great to be like:

""Hey, this is not the cryptocurrency known as bitcoin, you can find that here: bitcoin.org. Before you go take a look at this comparison of them"" - That way it's impossible for them to claim we're trying to mislead people and we still get our message out. We accomplish the same thing and seem more honest. 

---

That aside, there's more than just that lending to the idea that ""BCH Shills"" are misleading people and a lot of people in this thread are delusional to think otherwise. I've seen several comments like ""We aren't trying to confuse them""... Well somebody fucking is. If you haven't seen the comments saying stuff like ""Well BCH is the real bitcoin"" I don't even believe you can read. It happens all the time, and I have a couple thoughts on it. 

First, If you are the ones saying BCH is the real bitcoin, what's wrong with ""Well BCH is the one that follows the original paper"" or something. That way you don't seem shady and still have a good reason for the naming convention. 

Second, I think some of the people that say shit like that are actually core supporters. They say something stupid that is easily disproved or obviously sounds like a scam to make BCH look bad. It's a form of [astroturfing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astroturfing). They pretend to be BCH supporters and shout a bunch of dumb shit to make BCH supporters seem dumber, and to be loud enough to cover up actual benefits to BCH that are being talked about. 


---

I have two problems with the argument of BCH being the ""real bitcoin"".

1. I don't think we are the real one and this is one thing I personally strongly disagree with memorydealer on. We are not bitcoin. There was a vote, segwit won. Satoshi's paper itself says ""They vote with their CPU power, expressing their acceptance of...{stuff about valid blocks}...Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism"". So by satoshi's original definition, core is the real bitcoin, we are the fork. I think there's a strong parallel here with the president. Some people said ""not my president""... bitch, he's in the fucking white house so yes he is. You don't have to like him but he is literally the president. 

2. why does it matter? The ""real bitcoin"" doesn't make us more valuable or more useful as a currency. It changes nothing so there's no point wasting breath debating it. We need to be talking about the merits of big blocks over segwit and lightning, and we need to have honest conversations about it. We also need to be improving (which we are). Big blocks isn't enough. If big blocks is the only thing differentiating us, they'll steal it if it works and keep doing what they're doing if it doesn't work.

As a follow up to thinking that it isn't important: 

""Never argue with an idiot, they'll drag you down to their level and beat you with experience."" - George Carlin.

That stands perfectly for what we are doing. We're so busy shouting back and forth that nobody has bothered to fix ourselves before casting the proverbial first stone. When you see somebody say something that is wrong but in support of BCH, take the time to correct them. It's worth it. What will core say when we really can't be accused of being misleading. Their main argument is ""big blocks are too expensive"" and ""BCash shills are liars"" so let's stop feeding the lie. It doesn't matter if we agree on who the real one is because the outcome doesn't make a difference to the technology's usefulness. If we get rid of their ability to say that we are liars, then all they have left is the block size argument. For that we can let the tech speak for itself.
