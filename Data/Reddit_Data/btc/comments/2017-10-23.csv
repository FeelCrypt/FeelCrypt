">Second, you think that miners are somewhat more powerful than full nodes. This is not physical world, where power makes sense. This is math. Something false won't become true just because someone powerful says so. Miners could have 100% mining power, yet their block would be considered invalid by my node, if they disobeyed the rules.

Again, miners don't *need* to mine ""invalid"" blocks to defraud users or otherwise completely undermine the integrity of the network. Bitcoin's security is explicitly premised on the honesty of the mining majority. If that assumption doesn't hold, all the non-mining ""full nodes"" in the world won't help you.

>I guess your priority is Bitcoin being system for small payments.

My priority is Bitcoin being suitable for use as *money*.  [An arbitrary capacity constraint is a direct attack on Bitcoin's money property and basic value proposition](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6emrtd/three_ways_an_arbitrary_capacity_limit_harms/).

>I hope Bitcoin will catch up with LN.

LN and other so-called ""second-layer solutions"" are fundamentally irrelevant to the question of on-chain capacity. They are *banking*, not ""scaling.""

>Sadly, there is upcoming hardfork and people need to use full nodes to protect themselves because we don't know for sure which fork will have higher hash rate.

No, they really don't. If a persistent split occurs, you as a pre-fork holder will now have coins on two chains that exist as separately-tradeable assets. If you want to trade them separately you'll need to take steps to split your coins.  But that won't require running a ""full node"" for either chain.  If you want to receive funds on one chain post-fork, that also doesn't require running a ""full node"" for that chain. 

>The thing incentivising them to be honest are people verifying that they are. The only way to verify them is via full nodes.
...
>If there is a malicious majority, it'd be much more economical for them to make fake coins if nobody else verified. Since people are verifying, the only attack that they can do is double spend attack.

As I explained in that earlier linked comment:

Any systemic breach of Bitcoin's money properties by a misbehaving hash power majority is going to be communicated by *the market* when the price craters. *That's* the incentive system that we rely on to keep the hash power majority honest. And obviously not every single market participant needs to have first-hand evidence of a breach for the market to do its job. So I guess I have a hard time envisioning a scenario where it's become *so* outrageously expensive to run a ""full node"" that the market would lose the ability to disincentivize cheating (because miners will suddenly start to believe they can do so without getting caught). The incentive system *certainly* won't break down just because every Johnny Two-Bits can't afford to verify every form of breach for himself on his laptop. And of course, if running a ""full node"" were to become ""outrageously expensive,"" that implies that Bitcoin has become massively more popular and valuable which in turn implies that there will be many more people with an incentive to police the network's integrity.  Moreover, the individuals and entities with the greatest incentive to police the network and the greatest ability to punish a misbehaving mining majority are the same ones for whom the cost of operating a ""full node"" will always be trivial.";1;1;False;Capt_Roger_Murdock;doqysji;Since most people seem to have already forgot again what bitcoin was invented for, here is a copy of u/hodlgentlemen's post back then;77bx9m;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/77bx9m/since_most_people_seem_to_have_already_forgot/
"One confirmation doesn't mean anything. Especially for transactions bigger than ~13 BTC. If the exchange had miners, they could create invalid block creating 1000 BTC out of thin air and you'd see it as confirmed via your SPV node. You'd immediately detect fraud with full node.

Exchange will probably never do this on their own.

LN does not increase the blockspace. We have had Segwit for a few months and the blocks are still full.

Don't put words in my mouth. I am in favor of a lightning network, it will be necessary for micropayments. I am saying the lies about the lightning network I do not like. I do not like this mythical status it has been given and the suggestion it is the only scaling we need.

> Maybe you should submit a proposal to make a more wasteful transaction format, so we need even bigger blocks. In fact any second-layer scaling solutions and efficiency improvements must be stopped because it endangers blocksize increases. 

WTF are you talking about. Bitcoin always needed bigger blocks. We need them with LN and we need them without LN. If you want a wasteful proposal try segwit. It increases the waste by 50% everytime we increase the blocksize.
