That seems reasonable.  Are there other crypto currencies working this way?  I'm interested in how they're managing, since it seems there's a divide within the Bitcoin community as to whether or not a block size increase would be benefitial.;1;0;False;idontreadinbox;den1i9a;For 55.2% of Bitcoin addresses, fees are now bigger than the amount of Bitcoin they have.

"Back in the day when blocks were not full, transactions with no fees would go through no problem. 

To solve the high fee problem we just need to adopt bitcoin unlimited or similar â€“ increase the block size to 2 MB or greater (and increasing as time and network capacity go on). 

I would say a reasonable amount to charge would be something like this:

Up to $10 is free

Up to $100 is 2-5 cent fee

Up to $10k is 25 cent fee etc";2;1;False;southwestern_swamp;den10iu;For 55.2% of Bitcoin addresses, fees are now bigger than the amount of Bitcoin they have.

Yes. You would have to cross-reference every object in every known colored-coin implementation against the bitcoin blockchain tx db. My guess is most of the collisions would come from counterparty, some from Factom.;2;0;False;minerl8r;denxsl2;For 55.2% of Bitcoin addresses, fees are now bigger than the amount of Bitcoin they have.

Even though a HF will be a horrible experience for Bitcoin , I want BU members to go through with it because there needs to be some clarity to this 7 year debate about the direction of bitcoin and what better way to find that clarity with a HF failing and the miners coming back to the original chain. ;1;0;False;bitusher;den8b2v;AntPool signals for Bitcoin Unlimited;https://www.blocktrail.com/BTC/block/00000000000000000204cd2c9840023f1434f3dcdd7f471e4b8c8638d14d7006

"Hi, I and others would call it Bitcoin because it makes sense to call the original chain what it is and the new different chain that has different security mechanisms and rules an altcoin, but I respect your right to call it what whatever you want, and if you want to call your altcoin bitcoin as well than more power to you.

Unlikely it will come to this though as we will likely win the hashpower back when we dump the altcoin BU supporters created on exchanges.
