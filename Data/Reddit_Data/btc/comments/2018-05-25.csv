"I didn't say that people who understand BCH necessarily have a higher IQ than people who don't. I said that people who understand BCH are likely to have an IQ above a certain threshold. 

And yes, you should compare how well off you are to people in Africa as well. They are people too, just like you are.

Finally, that's ridiculous. Plenty of people enter and exit the top 1% every year. A lot of people end up in the 1% for some portion of their life. A hell of a lot more than 1% of them. Do a little research on it.

How do you know I haven't been in the 1% at some point already?";0;0;False;fossiltooth;dzjacw5;I think we are witnessing the biggest transfer of wealth of our generation as everyday peeps can now invest in crypto assets without anyone's permission.

This is why some people are obsessed with equality. Because I believe on long enough time lines what you mention is actually the case. Itâ€™s not obvious the ethical solution to it. ;1;1;False;justinduane;dzk2bm3;I think we are witnessing the biggest transfer of wealth of our generation as everyday peeps can now invest in crypto assets without anyone's permission.

"all of this could've been set aside, if the name was jsut Bitcash. Let them have their ""stor of value"" - coin.. we can have bitcash which has the better roadmap. thats it.

on the other hand i want to set things straight: of course BCH has a right to the name bitcoin. not just becasue it is a fork, but because it is THE fork, that was made to maintain the original vision of the coin. segwitcoin didn't just change the roadmap, they changed their whole target.

but instead of giving them spam and trollfodder, we could have been ""just another altcoin"", that works far superior than bitcoin, because it is cash....

meh, thinking about it, they would probably come up with: ""see, they just copied bitcoin, and now call it bitcash! its not bitcash!! its a bitcoin copy! its BITCOIN! lol.

"Histrionics, calculated or not, are only ever going to erode public trust in a project and BCH has had more than it's fair share.
