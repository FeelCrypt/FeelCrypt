"I'm not referring to ETH. Like our friends at the SEC say it's different in purpose. 

Too deep a topic to go in-depth here but IMO BTC's own example is what most threatens to invalidate its position, while the best alt projects have worked to solve its issues in their forks. Two examples:

(1) Governance: Decred, PIVX, and others creating advanced decentralized governance to  prevent BTC's toxic politics. 

(2) Proof of Work. BTC's energy use is irresponsible now. It will be dangerously, perhaps fatally so with planned mainstream adoption. Both in carbon footprint and as a national security concern for grids with mines of that scale. Alts have solved this with Proof of Stake and other working models, BTC is way way behind here.

Agreed on how dangerous the fork is. Guess now that it's here it remains to be seen if the public is smart enough to get crypto as a thing, or if the take away will be simply BTC's an unstable store of value, and it all goes poof."

No, that's not true. Read nullc's hobbies comment on your own subreddit [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4r0mfa/longest_chain_or_most_work/).
It may be profitable to attack a smaller chain if you can get someone to pay for your time. Say, you go and start selling transaction reversals via 51% attack. In certain situations this would be viable, e.g. on a higher value transaction with a small enough minority split. Pay some miner to reorg the block chain after confirmations hit and then quickly race in another transaction that drains all the involved TXOs.
We should definitely be talking about a chain's total work instead of length, because we get confused
[deleted]
Right - which is why the chain with the most blocks isn't necessarily the one with the most work. 
Once Bitcoin Cash has more hashpower, after difficulty catches up with the hashpower, Bitcoin Cash's blockchain will start building cumulative work faster than Witcoin's chain, and will eventually catch up (assuming the situation doesn't change any further). 
"Are you implying that Bitcoin Cash is not a fork of Bitcoin?  It's a ""hard fork"".  UASFers were/are willing to fork off as well.  They're pretty similar groups, just with divergent goals."
No, be better than your opponent, don't become what they are.
No no no see UASF were willing to actually fork! They would have died off in no time. They would have had by far the smallest chain. UASF did nothing to ensure their survival. They talked about difficulty adjustments and PoW changes and shiz but never implemented them because obvious altcoin is obvious.
"> Every single stupid question above could have been avoided if not for Bitcoin Cash explicitly ensuring their survival regardless of difficulty, regardless of hashrate, and regardless of being the longest chain or not. 

I agree.  I feel the same way about the UASF folks.  They still intend to fork off the network regardless of hash rate in 3 months, creating yet more confusion."
You now have two outputs for each pre-fork output (one on each chain).  They are the same value relative to the chain they are on. I.E. A 1btc output pre-fork is now 'worth' 1btc on the btc chain and 1 bcc on the bcc chain.  Value difference only comes into play in relation to other assets.
"The bitcoin paper provides this consensus mechanism so that everyone outside of the network doesn't have to. The purpose being that everybody should be able to receive and send bitcoins without ever having to worry if blocks are being produced which aren't in consensus. 

Is it BCC? Is it BCH? Is it Bcash? Is it Bitcoin? Guys how do I send my Bitcoin Cash and not my Bitcoin? Guys what do I need to do to prepare for this? Why does my exchange not even allow deposits during this period?

Every single stupid question above could have been avoided if not for Bitcoin Cash explicitly ensuring their survival regardless of difficulty, regardless of hashrate, and regardless of being the longest chain or not. 

If Bitcoin Cash was a real fork, it would have went like this: ""We just produced a 2MB block guys! We forked! But now most of the nodes and miners are rejecting our block because it wasn't in consensus and now their is a longer chain that doesn't include our 2MB block. Our chain is now dead because no one is mining our shorter chain and the difficulty is high."" Does anyone lose bitcoins here? Nope. That was by design. The entire bitcoin network could have kept smooth sailing if it was done this way.

Instead, an altcoin was created and they sadly put Bitcoin in the name and airdropped them at a 1:1 ratios to bitcoin holders based on a snapshot of the blockchain. Are CPUs voting on them? Nope. Does it matter that it has drastically less hashrate? Nope. Does it matters that it's the drastically shorter chain? Nope. ALTCOIN"

"With two-way replay protection, reorganizations aren't an issue.

Attacks could be an issue, but there's a strong incentive for miners to do what's profitable rather than waste hash power on a chain that may fade away on its own anyways."
that's possible but given anonymous can contribute is not personal is just an idea without consensus. which is when you either agree or go make your altcoin :)
"Market acceptance drives the demand which leads to price discovery.  Then mining difficulty adjusts until marginal cost of mining reaches price.

With traditional commodities like gold or oil the selling price fluctuates, but over the long term it aligns with the cost of production (or mining).  Due to the mining difficulty algorithm, Bitcoin is exactly the opposite.  The price is set by the market and then the cost of bitcoin mining aligns with the price."
"You need to stop thinking about physical coins or objects. Bitcoins don't actually exist.

A bitcoin is simply an unspent output to a previous transaction that you have the private key allowing you to use it as an input to a further transaction. 

A wallet is simply a storage mechanism for that Private Key.  

When there is a fork, you simply use your private key to sign a transaction on one chain to send those 'coins'.  You can then use that same private key to send a different transaction on the other chain.  Nothing is locked, nothing is lost."
Whenever a group of miners diverges from the consensus rules, a hard fork will occur.  That's what happened with Bitcoin Cash.  That is how Bitcoin has always functioned, and there is nothing ensuring that Bitcoin Cash continues to exist except for miners who continue to mine it.  It's up to them.
"That's exactly what I said?

Hashpower (miners) follow the price/difficulty ratio (that ratio being what decides if there's a profit

You just paraphrased my comment..."
"If major mining pools choose one client then it is de facto centralised again.

Introduction of a new feature to be voted on must take the form of a patch set that can be applied to the most commonly used client.

It's not good enough for these teams to only work on their clients from now on.

Teams + patch sets > clients

I can imagine a team that exists solely to produce patches to remove functionality too. E.g. a team that works on BCore and maintains patches to remove any controversial features"
That doesn't mean Gavin shouldn't come back as a dev for Bitcoin Cash, though.
You mean most cumulative work vs current hash power?
Is there somewhere I can see the cumulative difficulty of each chain? (the sum of all difficulties)
"> How about Segwit as hard fork without ANYONECANSPEND?

What for? Are you still pushing the obvious FUD that SegWit means literally anyone can steal anyone's fund, as some of r btc idiots argued with me for days?"
Sure. But FlexTrans is just nicer and more future-proof.
"I would love to see some sort of governance system like the DASH masternode voting system.  Allows governance issues to be sorted without having to fork.  

If people lose a ""fair"" vote they are much more likely to follow the result than if they believe one side censored their opinion or sybiled the argument to death or otherwise made things ""unfair"". "

I think you mean the chain with the most proof of work.
I called my mother Bitcoin if she owned the biggest mining farm. Let's call Jihan, Bitcoin then.
Too bad Bitcoin has 13x the hashpower of BCrash
I don't think he has to worry about this anymore. BTC > bcash
I really hope Gavin returns to active duty on Bitcoin development. Maybe he will reconsider once the dust settles and he realizes it's a safe environment once again.
"I agree with him. At that point, it will have earned no longer being ""bcash"""
Sounds like a challenge
Most accumulated hashpower, actually.
"It is easy to shut somebody out: make it a policy that all code must be reviewed by one of the active contributors.

Then the active contributors just practice benign neglect and don't bother reviewing code from somebody they dislike. Plausible deniability is 'seems like nobody cares about that pull request, closing for lack of interest.'"
Of course it's not. A hard fork wouldn't ensure it's own survival despsite all of satoshi's consensus mechanisms. 
"Gavin

You can call whatever coin you want Bitcoin.  You can wait for Bitcoin Cash to be the most work Sha256 chain and then call it Bitcoin if you like.  I doubt many people have a problem with that.

However, currently Bitcoin Cash is not the most work chain, yet it still exists.  If Bitcoin Cash becomes the most work chain, the original rules Core coin will still exist.

This illustrates why the BitcoinXT, Bitcoin Classic, BU and SegWit2x proposals are irresponsible. Unlike Bitcoin Cash, they do not have replay protection (and with the exception of SegWit2x they do not have wipeout protection).  Therefore, if one of those coins launch, we could have chaos and confusion with exchanges and users being replayed and losing money, it could be a total mess.  Please can you finally stop supporting these contentious hardforks which do not have these safety mechanisms?  If there is any significant opposition to the hardfork, we need these safety mechanisms.  This is what people have been saying for years, they are not against bigger blocks.

Many thanks
"
Exactly.
Once Bitcoin Cash has more hashpower, after difficulty catches up with the hashpower, Bitcoin Cash's blockchain will start building cumulative work faster than Witcoin's chain, and will eventually catch up (assuming the situation doesn't change any further). 
Yes and the price/demand hinges on market acceptance. It's reciprocal yes?
Longest chain meant more valid blocks. That was only relevant for soft forks though.
"> No, it just stinks of technical debt and looks ugly.

Lol, what a non-argument.  I can say the same about Bitcoin Unlimited, except that BU is the one that already had major security failures (remote crash)."

"In the long run, they are the same, since capital costs are ignored in economic models.
Put another way: miners will enter/leave the market until profits are exactly zero. The difficulty then adjusts to the new reality."
https://www.bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf
I think you've got the causality backward.  If the coin price is good, the miners will mine it leading to a longer chain with more work in it.  If the price falls mining becomes less profitable leading to a chain with less work in it.  It all hinges on the price/demand for the coin.
"That is how it has always been defined in the code. The whitepaper uses the shorthand ""longest chain"" to mean the same thing."
"No, it just stinks of technical debt and looks ugly. Think of reading book like ""Mastering Bitcoin"" and learning about bitcoin scripting for the first time. Bitcoin looks so cool and elegant but only until you get to Core's hacks.

I believe there is value in clean code, because it attracts talented people to work on the project. Although Core is actually so hostile to people outside their insider ring that I doubt people would want to work with them even if their code was super clean. What a crazy bunch of people. And most pathetic are the zealots who worship these people."
Good to hear from you. One of the best things to come from a split is to hopefully going back to mature developers. The core client, with a redesigned block structure for sigwit, should be considered the fork, bch is the original bitcoin design.
"The point I was trying to make is that it seems that some personalities are so toxic that even if they aid development the project as a whole suffers. I believe you yourself made that point very early on.

Compromising with those sorts seems counterproductive, so technical excuses not to compromise may be valuable. If a clean line in the sand had been drawn much earlier, maybe things would have gone better. Maybe all this drama was necessary to give the community a true picture of the personalities involved, though.

Anyway, you're far too nice and given a group of reasonable developers, you would have made an excellent benevolent dictator for the project."
Hope to see you come back..✌️ some recognizable names and some good leadership/team can go a long way right now 
"So the most work done - which makes sense and should prevent playing games with difficulty and block times.

"They wouldn't sell to me because I wanted them sent to a datacentre in China.

But what, now we're depending on the Wholesome goodness of Bitmain for Bitcoin to work, the company that buys tweets, installs remote kill switches, spends money on covert asicboost, etc. What ever happened to trustless.

They don't even have to overtly threaten, you don't toe the line and there's a minor hiccup with you next order, a delay, a problem with your shipping address, a faulty batch of chips, a misconfigured bios. And your pool % slides backwards a few points. I'd already be scared to cross Bitmain if I was heavily invested in mining."
To what? the fact that Bitmain can write the code and not sell hardware to miners that are not compliant?
Zelda?
there is no evidence they've ever done any of that 
"then setup your own ASIC manufacturing company.  none of that shit you mentioned has been proven to be true.  miners as a whole have been very good stewards of the community.  then never had a clue about what BSCore was doing behind their backs until the big blockists clued them in.  leave it to core and all miner fees will get siphoned/diverted/stolen to offchain layers ala LN hubs and Liquid like federated servers.  now i hear Blockstream is planning to sell faster hardware tx validators; no wonder, their CT sidechain abomination for privacy takes 50x the processing requirements compared to normal tx's.  then there's that former coder who did contracting work for them recently who described just how right those of us skeptics are about the internal workings of Blockstream.  sounds like a nightmare.

miners have finally caught on and are protecting their turf that core devs have been desperately seeking to profit from.  sorry.  that ain't gonna happen."
"How do you see that playing out. 

Bitmain choose to selectively sell their mining hardware to compliant pools which is cool, their hardware their choice.

In the meantime they modify the code as they see fit. 

Gold Rush starts and what changes? Samsung becomes a major ASIC producer? Do we have to wait for that before we ""decentralise""."
I am grateful for not including RBF in Bitcoin Cash and welcome back 0 confirmation small transactions. We need a name for that too. Should we call that **Instant Small Payments** or if you can think of another name, that will be great.
Sure there is. For transactions where you were planning on waiting for confirmations anyway it's beneficial to use RBF as it allows you to use a lower, riskier fee since you can increase it if it turns out the original fee was not enough to get into a block.
It was introduced to allow users to bump the fee if their transaction got stuck in the mempool due to the ridiculous blind fee auction.
RBF is an opt-in feature. Why would people standing in the shop choose to voluntarily activate a feature that they know will cause extra waiting time? Just send a normal default non-RBF transaction that the shop accepts with 0 confirmations.
Don't assume all use cases are equal. Extreme privacy isn't needed at your local grocer or cafe where they know you.
[removed]
I think it's somewhat appropriate in this context though considering the Segwit promoters are trying to say bitcoin cash is not really bitcoin.
Yes, I did make this. I agree with the name ZeroConf being cool. I will be including it in the next iteration of the infographic. 
no, the shop is going to relay the transaction to make sure it will arrive in the mempool.
Yes, you are right. I will be adjusting this wording in the next iteration of my infographic.
It's called reality, you are welcome to visit anytime.
I'd say that Bitcoin Cash send more willing to adapt the protocol than Core. That's why they hard forked, and blocksize isn't the only change they made. I'm taking a wait and see approach toward Bitcoin Cash.
Sure. Would you be interested in buying a bridge by any chance?
Yes, I do realise that its price will likely fall in the short term, as people sell off their BCC balances. I don't think that this will last very long, with the growing adoption of bitcoin cash and additional infrastructure acceptance and compatibility. 
"As you say, it's subjective, which answers your original question: ""How can some user accounts believe that Bitcoin Cash is the alt?""."
At this point I think it is too early to make a point out of the mining of bitcoin cash. It has not been around long enough to attract a wide base of mining support yet, but I am confident that it will in the coming days and weeks. At this stage its mining is centralized, but that is because the chain has only just started. It just needs more miners to join. 
Witness data does not need to be stored long term. So yes. Cheaper. Less resources used.
Wallets are not significant here. We're talking about the protocol itself. As for the 2MB upgrade, that is separate to Segwit and you well know it, otherwise you would refer to it as a 1.7MB upgrade.
well that accounting trick also lets you discard historical witness data you are never going to use again.
In my opinion, the merchant whose node you used to broadcast the low fee (or 0 fee) transaction could rebroadcast it from time to time until its included in a block.
"The 8MB is just the starting point.  It will be 16mb, 32mb, 64mb ... as needed in the future when the time comes.

Yes, there will be another HF network upgrade when that time comes,"
Yeah probably the right approach. It is an improvement for sure!
I know the generally accepted theories in here. Never see any compelling evidence though. I will leave you all to it and go back to places where it is about the what and not the who (and, no, that is no the other subreddit).

You have used a whole bunch of ""newspeak"" style terminology pulled out of thin air to make Bitcoin Cash look better. 


3 is flat out false, there are numerous Bitcoin client implementations and have been for years now.


You've also misrepresented Segwit in #2, as it's not possible to remove signatures from the Blockchain.

An individual node can choose to prune historical signatures from *their locally stored copy*, but the Bitcoin blockchain still contains signatures for every transaction, and Segwit nodes verify those signatures upon receiving each block. 
"
"well two things to me, nothing about BCH precludes off-chain scaling, which is inevitable and writing it off is kinda shooting BCH in the foot.

also calling it SecureSig is strange unless BCH started including sigs in the hash and preventing txid malleability. Those are legit problems with sigs and calling it Secure kind of implies those are actually addressed. Please correct me if they are, i'm just not aware of those fixes in BCH."
"> Definetly was a great programmer

Great disagreement here. It's a monolithic program instead of the modularity the functions it serves would call for (wallet vs. validating node vs miner), it's done in a wholly inadequate language, and it's got quirks that for a long time nobody dared touch due to how fragile and non-compliant-with-what-the-code-said was (like the DB bug that caused the fork way back when it was attempted to be upgraded). IIRC up until not too long ago it also had some pretty rigid, version-dependent dependencies in order to compile.

It was well debugged, and throughout the years the code has been attempted to be cleaned up, but it will take a from-the-ground-up reimplementation (like the parity guys are attempting) in order for it to be able to be called truly elegant, solid, and efficient software.

Let's call it like it is, and not romaticise our heroes. I can tolerate Satoshi being a visionary, yet also a mediocre coder."
It should do. I think the default now is to require a fee but it might be worth trying a transaction without. Of course, many nodes will not relay feeless transactions.
Phenomenal.
This is a dumb question. Evaluate ideas based on their own merit, not based on the person who spoke them
No, I am not a network engineer. I am merely explaining my interpretation of the benefits of a decentralized client ecosystem. What are your arguments against having multiple co-operating clients that operate the network? If there were to be a programing flaw found in a monolithic client implementation, all nodes would be effected simultaneously, impacting the whole network. Whereas in a diverse client ecosystem, only a subset of the network would be effected, allowing other nodes to continue unaffected. This would allow the network to continue until the flawed implementation is patched, and would encourage client developers to have rigorously secure code, to protect their market share more than a monopoly on the client implementation. 
"So are we calling this thing bcoin, bcc, Bitcoin crash? Names are kind of important...

And also, the next time we fork actual Bitcoin what are we going to call it?"
Yeah, spreading the risk of failure over multiple implementations will add a level of redundancy to the network, making it resistant to critical flaws that take out the entire node network.
"No.. the bug will only affect the said implementation.

Too bad for those using it but the network at large will have **less** chance of a full network wide bugs."
Yes, future protocol upgrades will be necessary.
"It could be, just a 10mbps connection downloads more than 1MB per second(600 MB in 10 minutes), compared to 8MB each 10 minutes there is room for almost 100x blocks(8MB blocks).

But once bitcoin cash gets there, a lot of off chain solutions might be implemented. What you can't do as a brand is giving a poor service while you figure things out."
Mate, if you still don't understand why multiple implementations are absolutely necessary after the BU node crash shimozzle, you're beyond reasoning and will forever live in your closed minded bubble. Have fun in there.
This is intended to be a guide for novices, but not completely new users. The features are explained relatively simply, but at lease some minimal understanding of bitcoin and the scaling debate is required. 
"Not yet.  But 0-conf has been brought back by removing RBF.
"
Which parts are untrue?
"Did you make this?

I just thought of something to add to the table: Bitcoin Cash has brought back 0-conf as a thing. We chucked out RBF (replace-by-fee) which essentially made 0-conf be unreliable due to the ease of creating double-spends and 'chargebacks'.

Maybe we can come up with a clever name (actually ZeroConf is a cool name)... and highlight that as well.
"
"Do you realize the bitcoin core developers are an amazingly talented team? If you had to assemble some of the very best developers possible for crypto they would be btc core. If you want objective terms why doesn't this include segwit in block size; why doesn't it include merchant acceptance; why doesn't it include liquidity; why doesn't it include bitmain using bcash as means to still use their asiac boost?"
It's certainly a valid point (until the Segwit2x fork if it happens), and making it concise enough for the graphics while being accurate is a challenge.

">  this fork was orchestrated by the people who already have tens of millions of dollars in bitcoin and wanted to essentially double their money. 

uhh... even if that's how it ends up, it also ""doubles the money"" of anyone holding any pre-fork bitcoins.

You'd think all holders of bitcoin would be pleased by that, right?

But many die-hard Core supporters, right up to some of the developers themselves, don't really have much bitcoin, so they're angry. Like you. Despite telling everyone here to ""fork off already"" for the better part of a year.

> It does nothing of real value except solve problems that dont exist.

At the very least, the new chain takes the narcissistic Core neckbeards out of the picture. That alone was Bitcoin's biggest problem."
I'm not a long time use, just started in 2016. Bitcoin transactions in part of 2017 could take days with electrum's default fee.  That problem is real. 
Jesus, stop with the Orwellian nonsense. Conservation is by definition not a change or an improvement. You can say SegWit is a downgrade, but you can't call not implementing it an upgrade.
Are you one of those noobs who thinks transaction backlogs are a good thing?
Wjat planet are you on? 
As soon as possible. 
Yes I can only agree that Bitcoin Cash is obviously superior to current Bitcoin. However I'm unsure why Segwit + bigger blocks haven't been combined? Are the risks involved with SegWit somehow prohibitive?
I'm well aware of that problem and it does worry me. It's just that Bitcoin Cash seems to be somehow settled on the matter of simply increasing block size whereas Ethereum seems to be more willing to implement new solutions. That's just my take on it though and don't get me wrong I'm concerned about the size of the blockhain on both.
The lead maintainer is not controlled by Blockstream. 
"> Once it has been settled, and exchanges are able to process deposits and withdrawals normally, it's price will likely promote new mining power to join the network.

Once deposits are available, the price will tank.  Do you realize that the price is 65% lower on HitBTC (allows deposits) vs Bittrex (does not allow deposits)?"
Alright then
"So Bitcoin being at capacity for about a year isn't a problem?

This thinking is why a split is needed - fundamentally different visions that are incompatible need to go their separate ways."
because every shop REALLY wants a huge queue of customers standing around waiting for their transaction to be confirmed, that's going to REALLY send that particular business into bankruptcy faster than you can say superkalafragilisticexpialidocious
In other words there isn't actually a use case for it.
complete nonsense. really, the shop is going to mine that for you?
Which elements of the graphic strike you as being loaded or biased? I am trying to describe the Bitcoin cash hard fork upgrade in an impartial, but engaging way.  
Good point. I will make a note of ZeroConf in the next iteration of the infographic. 
"> ZeroConf

Everybody uses ""0-conf""."
I like how big blocks are good for bitcoin because they follow satoshi's vision (and it's the true bitcoin because of this!) but multiple implementations are good for bitcoin because satoshi is just  a guy and his advice is not that important.
It was arguably his *strongest* point, I would say.
"> I know this might seem like picking and choosing, but Satoshi was a great many things, just not a great programmer, and certainly not an expert in mission-critical, decentralised systems.

Definetly was a great programmer. Satoshi's Bitcoin core is very solid software both from a Software Architecture and from a usability perspective.
It's always been low on bugs which is a great achievement (especially since it's in C++).  

The only super critical bug I can think of right now was the Coin overflow. There were also a few chain splitting bugs early on but not a lot."
Keep telling yourself that, maybe it will magically come true one day

"No it wasnt, read the first quote. The additional maintenence required is just an additional argument why a second implementation is bad.

Naturally if for example Kraken uses Bitcoin Implementation 2, and Bitcoin Implementation 2 has a malfunction, even if i use Bitcoin Implementation 1 i still cannot interact with Kraken because their implementation malfunctioned. 

If you still dont understand why multiple implementations isnt benefecial at this point you are beyond help."
">  it is my opinion

Okay, why does your opinion matter? Are you a network engineer or expert of some kind? Just wondering"
Satoshi just didn't anticipate the one core implementation being taken over by hostiles.
I agree with this. It's the same way the aerospace industry improves redundancy: write multiple versions of your software in different languages with the same spec. You spread your risk.
Counterpoint: Having n different implementations increases the risk of a bug taking down the whole network at a rate proportional to n^(2), because they all need to agree with each other on all the important implementation details.
Question. What is the point of removing a 1mb cap just to replace it with an 8mb cap? Do you guys think the 8mb cap will never be hit or are you planning another hardfork when you reach 8mb?
RBF is optional anyway so why do you even complain ? No one is forcing you to use it or to accept those txs without confirmation.
"> if all miners require a fee

But if not all the miners require a transaction fee it'll confirm, it just might take a while, right?"
Thanks! I'm hoping the metric notation catches on (although tbh I don't know what .00037 would be in metric :P). Another person said if all miners require a fee then it won't get confirmed. From what I remember, unconfirmed transactions slowly rise in priority even if their fee is low. Is this also correct?

It wouldn't, but I wanted to correct your faulty comparison. 
"When the code is correct (avoiding undefined behaviour, no memory leaks), does it really behave differently in different environments?

I haven't used Rust, Erlang and Go yet (Had no time to take a look, a small pitch for the strengths of each would be appreciated), but each of them probably have some drawbacks.

For example GC is nice, but also slow and unpredictable (At least that's a problem for realtime applications, for Bitcoin it may actually be the better solution).

Erlang is dynamically typed, which also opens up a can of worms in my experience (I rather type out the variable type and always know what to expect, than making one error and the program keeps on running, suddenly making a string out of my int or the likes).

It's difficult for me to get away from something tried and tested like C++, yeah, if you make errors in your code you shoot your foot off, but if you avoid undefined behavior and have an idea about memory leaks it's a really powerful and reliable language (Which most software is currently relying on). "
Go, Erlang, Rust, OCaml...lol
Go didn't exist in 2008. I agree about Erlang, though (which is also a functional language, by the way).
Some wallets may not recognize modified transactions either and open their users up to fraud too.
That's a possibility - we don't know
The block reward and those who pay fees.
Some wallets may not recognize the RBF flag and open their users up to fraud. Or someone may not see or properly react to the RBF notice in their wallet for some reason. That's the problem with it. The use cases for fraud are much stronger than for legitimate purposes.
"That's because nobody was fucking using RBF! ugh...

""It's not a problem because it never became a problem because nobody uses it."" "
">it's very possible to double spend transactions even without RBF if you want to. 

I know how to do one, do you? Because its only a very small amount of people who actually KNOW how to do it.

Then there is those who are actually CAPABLE of doing it (not me, but I could if I really wanted and spent the money in the 1st place to be able to).

I don't think you really understand what a ""double spend"" is.

>Any merhcant that wants to protect itself from this needs to scan the mempool for possible double spends 

How many merchants that accept bitcoin also scan the mempool after every transaction? Name 5, or just 1.

>and also ensure that the fee is high enough that the transaction will propagate properly and is likely to get confirmed.

So the merchant tells the user what fee to use? Have you ever actually USED bitcoin? Of the very many times over the many years you've USED bitcoin, how many times has the MERCHANT told you what fee they want you to include?

(ZERO times for me over 5 years, and many, many transactions - *I* decide what fee I use, don't know what you're using, but welcome to bitcoin!)

No point in that rambling post did you have anything resembling a point.

Economic nodes, Mining Hashpower, Acceptance, Market Cap.

Bitcoin Cash has none of those so far.

"no segwit is itself 2MB

1) OK. 2) Hell no. LN needs to succeed (if at all) from natural incentives, not artificial ones.
"With or without RBF, receivers need to do some kind of fraud prevention. As have been proven many times, it's very possible to double spend transactions even without RBF if you want to. Any receiver that wants to protect himself from this needs to scan the mempool for possible double spends and also ensure that the fee is high enough that the transaction will propagate properly and is likely to get confirmed.

Compared to all of this, checking what is essentially a boolean flag is trivial.

EDIT: You do realize that RBF has been active for half a year without double spends becoming a problem at all, right?"
Agreed. And it will - instant transactions and things like atomic swaps are great incentives. Doesn't really matter whether blocks are artificially full or not. 
Lol ok we have different opinions. I'm not saying put up with $1 or even $0.25 for arbitrary reasons, but making all chain tx effectively free is bad from a spam perspective. Bots executing micro transactions on the chain helps no one.
"Haha, glad I'm not the only one who went through such an experience.

There are a ton of very interesting languages out there, but most of the time I'm lacking time to look into them :-/ And if all you have is a hammer (Mostly C++ and C#) then everything looks like a nail."
"True, the whole way through. You're totally right.

Erlang was my first direct experience with a functional programming language, too, so I could actually feel my brain warp as I worked with it. It holds a special place in my heart, personally."
"**Ada (programming language)**

Ada is a structured, statically typed, imperative, wide-spectrum, and object-oriented high-level computer programming language, extended from Pascal and other languages. It has built-in language support for design-by-contract, extremely strong typing, explicit concurrency, offering tasks, synchronous message passing, protected objects, and non-determinism. Ada improves code safety and maintainability by using the compiler to find errors in favor of runtime errors. Ada is an international standard; the current version (known as Ada 2012) is defined by ISO/IEC 8652:2012.

"It's an interesting concept directly built into the language, asynchronous messaging between modules and nodes, with a general service that monitors exceptions and crashes and can start up crashed nodes again.

A system like this can also be built in C++ though (Catching exceptions, starting up worker threads where it doesn't matter if they crash, ...).

It's an interesting concept nonetheless, but you still need to have correct code and build some of that reliability yourself. I'll have to look into it some more when I have time."
"You are comparing a real time real world application (Flying a plane, software failure = plane crashes) to a more data driven transaction software (Bitcoin). When it comes to data you don't want to just keep running when an error happens, as that error can possibly screw up future transactions (Of course you can and should always check these transactions with other nodes to see if a node is acting 'hostile' to the network with false transactions).

As far as I can see current military and avionics software either uses specialized single purpose hardware, or [Ada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_\(programming_language\)).

What counts at the end: Bugfree and well performing software. If C++ couldn't deliver that it wouldn't be used for most things you currently use. Sure, other languages allow you to make more errors and still keep running, but those errors need to be handled sooner or later as they will lead to problems. Regardless of the language you use, your code has to be correct, there is no way around that."
"**Fail-fast**

In systems design, a fail-fast system is one which immediately reports at its interface any condition that is likely to indicate a failure. Fail-fast systems are usually designed to stop normal operation rather than attempt to continue a possibly flawed process. Such designs often check the system's state at several points in an operation, so any failures can be detected early. A fail-fast module passes the responsibility for handling errors, but not detecting them, to the next-highest level of the system.

"Yes, Erlang is all about making sure things crash when anything goes wrong, but *also* making sure the overall system stays up and running.

It might be worth actually looking into the language and paradigm before trying to comment on it."
"> Running on despite errors is a feature now, the hell?

Definitely, if your goal is to build a [fault-tolerant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fault_tolerance) system.

[Fail Fast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fail-fast) is all well and good until you're writing software that keeps a Boeing 747 with 250 passengers on board in the air. Or the software which operates pacemakers and keeps someones heart beating. Or maybe, software which sustains the transactional capability of 45 billion dollars worth of economy.

Erlang was originally built for telephone exchange switch boxes handling many thousands of phone calls concurrently. If an error occured in one you wouldn't want the software to drop all the calls at once. If you need software that can manipulate some bits & send them over a copper wire, I don't think there's anything that can beat Erlang for that. Especially if you need to do it in a fault-tolerant, highly parallelized way."
Yeah sure, I wasn't saying that I favor full blocks, I just meant it should be irrelevant for the success of lightning. 
"Running on despite errors is a feature now, the hell? When something goes wrong I actually hope that it crashes, instead of running on and wreaking havoc on the data. The errors that are the most difficult to find and debug are the ones that don't make your application crash..

For small non important things you can always catch the exceptions to avoid a crash, but that's also not a very elegant way to set up your software."
I have no problem with miners setting a min fee. 
I believe the same thing too. Except that I think that artificially full blocks are damaging in many ways (the lack of true introspection on the issues currently facing LN for example)
"> With or without RBF, receivers need to do some kind of fraud prevention.

I agree.  People have been doing this for years...since 2009. As we've gone over already, RBF is hardly used in the real world.

> As have been proven many times, it's very possible to double spend transactions even without RBF if you want to.

Besides proof of concept attacks, has that ever been a serious problem? I don't think so.  If it was, it would *still* be a problem as almost all transactions are non-RBF even now. What problem has RBF actually solved for users?

> You do realize that RBF has been active for half a year without double spends becoming a problem at all, right?

This is beside the point.  The point is that RBF is a feature that (almost) nobody asked for, (almost) nobody uses, makes a double-spend attack potentially easier to execute, and adds to the complexity of Bitcoin wallet code everywhere.  Even if that added complexity is fairly trivial, why add it in the first place?  Again, what real-world problem has RBF solved to justify its inclusion in Bitcoin?  This should be the first question asked of any software enhancement."
We don't need RBF if we have reliable 0-conf payments because every transaction gets into a block because we have a proper block size. DUH 
"> So which chain fundamentally changed?

Well, until SegWit is activated then only BCH has changed, since it upped the block limit.

But change itself isn't a bad thing. Changes and new features that extend beyond ""satoshi's vision"" have been added repeatedly.

I don't understand what your point is, if you accept that ""muh original vision"" isn't really an argument. Bitcoin isn't a religion, we don't have saints and holy scripture. We have engineering pragmatism."
">Erlang is dynamically typed, which also opens up a can of worms in my experience (I rather type out the variable type and always know what to expect, than making one error and the program keeps on running, suddenly making a string out of my int or the likes).

Erlang is all about programs continuing to run despite failures. It's a fascinating paradigm, I recommend looking more into it.

I don't know if it would have been better to implement Bitcoin in Erlang than C++ (my own gut tells me ""no"") but it's still worth checking out."
which point?
No. And with bcash difficulty discount mechanism, it becomes cheap for a malicious miner to exploit it?
"Wladimir rejects anything controversial. That means core devs working for Blockstream can reject proposals, but not force new things.

I don't like this, but it is different from controlling everything. Also, most core devs not related to Blockstream seem to agree with them. Moreover, there is no clear financial motive for Blockstream in the opinions of 'its' core devs..

SegWit is supported by a vast majority of actors with money at stake or with deep knowledge of Bitcoin. 

It's all a bit more nuanced than many here like to believe."
Well, I've read as much as I've been able to find online for a couple of months, care to explain how knowing the story would affect my ability to note a biased infographic? As far as I can tell, it is pretty much the opposite.
"They list:

> Puts more control into the hands of miners (who get the decide on the block size)

As a con? Who should decide block size? Bankers?"
Since when is C++ a wholly inadequate language? What the hell would you use?
"> Great disagreement here. It's a monolithic program instead of the modularity the functions it serves would call for (wallet vs. validating node vs miner)

We are making up modules here that don't exist or didn't exist at the time. Bitcoin core is a full node, in the original design a non mining full node was not planned. Of course a full node contains a wallet, a ""relay"" node was never planned (it's not a feature, it's a side effect).
Also note that these features are indeed seperate at the code level, they are just packaged as a single thing. (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/0.8/src/walletdb.cpp for example contains the wallet, while p2p code lives in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/0.8/src/net.cpp )
Having the QT GUI in the same product is a little strange but understandable.

I however do agree that more seperation of concerns at a higher level might have been nice, however I imagine that there were also time/engineering resource constraints and while we do not know a lot about the early development of Bitcoin if we assume that the goal was to deliver a product to jumpstart the Bitcoin ecosystem and to deliver the full functionality which had to be developed by a single person (satoshi) as soon as possible the outcome is exceptional.

I fully agree that C++ is not the ideal choice for a programming language but given satoshi's technical background (assumed) it was likely the perfect choice."
Sorry i am not going to get into a discussion here because you get downvoted if you dont play the narrative so its obviously not appreciated, besides satoshi put it pretty clearly and feel free to investigate the discussion linked. 
The converse to your argument is that the probability of something going wrong due to n different implementations being used at the same time grows as O(n^(2)), since they all need to talk to each other.
"it's called Bitcoin Cash, not bcash and not bcc - that last one is purely a trading symbol. 

Assuming any fork follows the vision laid out in Satoshis White Paper, then the coin remains the same after upgrading protocol.   "
If any change to the protocol requires a new name what do you think we should call the new SegWit coin?
That's a super biased summary.
"You're talking about a hypothetical bug as if you already know exactly how it works.

There are many hypothetical bugs that can affect the interoperability between a pair of clients. If there are n distinct clients, the number of distinct pairs of clients grows as O(n^(2))."
Why not a dynamic block size limit from the beginning?
"Yeah, that's why I was assuming the business would run their own node for feeless transactions. When the Core folks were throwing around the FUD of ""omg node centralization!"" I was super confused. Like, no average user is going to run a node for a settlement layer, that makes no sense. For a payments network the average user may not want/afford to but an average small business probably can. So yeah we'd lose all those rasberry pi nodes but we'd (theoratically) gain thousands of business nodes. I guess also feeless might be an exageration. ""Very low fee transaction"" might be more accurate. Thanks for the response!"
"It should never have come so far that your transaction is not included in the next block.

The block space market (aka fee market) is a failed science project.

I'm not saying that there should be no fees (maybe not for high coin-age) but a simple min-fee setting by miners is enough."
The problem with that is that I'm willing to pay a much higher fee for large transactions than small ones anyway and am unlikely to bother with trying to gamble on a low fee in the first place. How many RBF transactions actually happen these days? My guess is that it's right around zero. 
Bcore: crafting convoluted solutions to problems of their own invention.
Here you perfectly showed why there is no real use case for RBF...
"Because when you walk out you can send a higher fee and get your money back.

Most shops are not going to make you wait around for ages, or they will just refuse to accept RBF.

Or, the most likely scenario is that (sometimes) they don't realise you're doing it.

Buy 10 items for $100, RBF them all. Probability of getting 1 of them back is pretty decent (do 20 items if 10 isn't enough). Do it daily and that's $100 of items a day (that you can resell on ebay, pawn it in a brick and mortar shop, or anywhere else).

You don't even need to buy 10 items, just go into a shop and try RBF, if they refuse, say ""ok"" and walk out and try the next shop. Or do the same method online.

Rinse and repeat.

And with Settlment Coin/BCore, you *need* RBF (due to forced congestion), or your shopping transaction might take 2 weeks, a very long time to build a queue in a store.."
"Then why does it state ""8mb maximum"""
Sounds like you don't know the history of the split from /r/bitcoin...
Sorry I didn't mean to imply that. But i do believe it's true that 99% of full nodes, including miners, have no need to validate historical blocks. It's always available in any case.
Submit a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal to scale on-chain and you will quickly discover that they will reject it.  It's SegWit or bust.
C++ has a lot of undefined behaviour and is notorious for behaving differently in different environments, even the same code compiled by different compilers can behave differently. This is a risk factor when you have many nodes which need to behave identically. C++ is great for some things, but it wouldn't be my first choice for Bitcoin. I can think of a few other languages which might be more appropriate. Go and Erlang are both great for networking systems. Rust is great for memory safety and eliminating undefined behaviour. Functional languages like OCaml are great for finance applications. I'd love to see node implementations in any/all of those languages.
Has satoshi being a team of people been ruled out?
I hope this network engineer sells all of his Bitcoin for BCash. There's an overwhelming supply of BCash and little to no actual demand. It'll be interesting when the exchanges start allowing sales after 20 confirms, which will litterally take days.
Oh, I see. So this was Satoshi's idea?
Because its the current state.
"1) 8mb will last a really long time, especially on a fork.
2) you don't want to fully remove the incentive for LN"
Because EC will probably not work or at least there is a chance it will screw up
Crawl, walk, run.
"They whipped up the project pretty quick, in a matter of a few weeks.  There was some debate between XT/Classic/BU on how to handle bigger blocks, they all want bigger blocks, but they have different ways about it.

BU is only one that uses EC.  They just decided to do 8MB so they could quickly deploy it and then figure out further details later."
So who's gonna pay for miners to secure the network?
Yes, I would guess that most blocks don't contain a single RBF transaction. I don't see why we need to forbid people from using it if they have a use case though, since it has zero impact unless you choose to use it.
"With or without RBF, merchants need to do some kind of fraud prevention. As have been proven many times, it's very possible to double spend transactions even without RBF if you want to. Any merhcant that wants to protect itself from this needs to scan the mempool for possible double spends and also ensure that the fee is high enough that the transaction will propagate properly and is likely to get confirmed.

Who decides that? To me segwit is a big departure from the white paper. Bitcoin cash is not.
Yes, it is. Th e 2mb hard fork is in November. SegWit activates mid August. That's pretty fucking separate don't you think? And BSCore's Adam Back has been saying on Twitter he doesn't see the need for the 2mb portion.
Kid, go back to your room and do your homework!
Please explain.
"> 99% of full nodes, including miners, have no need to validate historical blocks

If this is true, just prune all the data. No need for Segwit and you get rid of more wasted space. That's always been available and part of the scaling plan. "
"I understand the value of determining Bitcoin to be the chain with the most hashpower behind it, it's objective. What happens after sw activates? It will have more hashpower, and thus be called Bitcoin. What happens if feature x, y, z... and so forth are activated and Bitcoin is no longer a Peer to Peer electronic cash system? If hashpower is all that is considered, we'd continue to call it Bitcoin.

At what point, if ever, would we say ""that's not Bitcoin"". I think segwit is that point (others may disagree, and that's fine). Segwit is an incremental change to Bitcoin that does not fit into my definition. Definition creep."
For keks
I am not entirely familiar with this change, I will research it more and include it in the next iteration.
I like what bitfinex did. It's the bitcoin symbol with an additional hash which is a box thing afterwards
https://youtu.be/E7oWe5t6CGk
Yes, I agree. The note is a more significant and relevant alteration than the change in angle of the bitcoin logo. It is distinctive and I choose to include it for this reason, as the peer to peer cash element of bitcoin can be visualised better with a note than a coin. 
Yeah it's called unconfirmed transactions.
I have a question about zero confirmation transactions. Let's say I go to a store down the street for me and I buy a pack of gum with 0.00037 BTC. I don't really want to pay a transaction fee for such a small item and neither does the store. Could the store just run a node and ask me to direct my transaction at their node so they have a record that I've paid and it's in the mempool with the assumption that it'll just get confirmed at some point?
**FAST** - Fast (or *Flash* maybe) and Secure Transactions
Yes that was a complete joke. As Mike Hearn pointed out, you could simply pay for something, receive the goods and then replace the transaction by paying I higher fee as you walked out of the shop. Total madness.
I think ZeroConf transactions has a good ring to it. 
"I think a lot of people are calling it ""singlespend"" you only spend one no double spend. "
"Good job!

You should note than the scaling plan is ""unproven tech"" for Bcore, and Bitcoin cash include off chain also!"
I also hated RBF, thank fuck it's gone! 
Number 2 isn't a change. It's a continuation of how Bitcoin (currently still) works before Segwit is activated.

BCC supports lightning network too?
I chose to focus on the primary scaling plan of each coin, but it does warrant mentioning this point. I will add it into the next iteration.
This is my opinion also. There is a much lower risk of a fatal flaw in the node network if there are multiple independent codebases that co-operate and compete for market share. A flaw in one will allow the other node versions to thrive, and flaws would only effect one implementation at a time. It would allow an evolution of clients over time that become more resilient to flaws, as the best clients would be selected.

Our forked system is called **Bitcoin Cash** because it is **Bitcoin**  - A Peer-to-Peer Electronic **Cash** System
"To properly validate a block, the on-chain and off-chain data needs to be validated.

Moving the signatures out of the main block is a concern since miners may try to 'save time' by starting to mine on top of a block when they have not yet retrieved and validated the signatures stored off-chain.

There was a problem a few years ago where a miner successfully built a new block without fully validating the actual data in the block, and other miners built on top of this.  And while this is possible on both flavors of bitcoin, but storing signatures off-chain adds another way that a miner could take a shortcut."
Agreed. More block chain space means more green field development space for various L2 implementations. The key is that Bitcoin Cash should remain agnostic to them, but simply provide the best onchain security and throughput.
The benefits of a larger maximum block size are not included in this diagram, as I am remaining as impartial as possible, and describing feature changes, not my opinion of what is likely to result from the changes. You are correct though, but I left the benefits of larger blocks to be implied by the reader.

I designed it to be sleek and easy to understand. It is better to describe the changes of bitcoin cash in a way that is positive, and I think that PowerBlocks and SecureSigs makes these features more understandable to new users. Bitcoin cash should aim to have a simple and impactful image for mainstream adoption. 
"One small point. I assume BCC will have on- and off-chain scaling eventually.

So I would put both options under BCC, rather than give the impression it's scaling through 'bigger blocks or bust'.

"I agree with you in principle, however I don't think we can call it a heterogenous network just yet. The fact is that all of the Bitcoin Cash client implementations are forks of the Bitcoin Core codebase, and therefore are 99% similar. It's very likely that bugs affecting one client will affect the other clients. The network is still effectively homogenous.

If we want a truly heterogenous network (we do), we need multiple ground-up implementations, targeting different environments, written in different programming languages by different programmers.

The fact that something like 98% of the nodes on the network (both forks) run a single codebase or code directly derived from a single codebase scares the crap out of me."
I'm sure they'd appreciate a heterogenous network of implementations so long as it was provided by Core. /s
I'm mildly leaning toward Bitcoin Cash because I believe scaling should be on-chain.  Also dropping signatures doesn't sound like a good idea
How about the mining control/(de)centralization?
I'm new to this and confused by the fork. Should I buy into bitcoin or bitcoin cash?
Nice to see that bCash has a saner block size.
Sounds like bullshit
"As someone who has moved from Bitcoin to Ethereum there is one thing I'm strongly questioning about Bitcoin Cash.

Solving scaling by increasing block size means that the chain will require a massive amount of storage. The problem is that first of all it's not enough and even if you did make blocks large enough for BTC to scale well you would be using far too much storage for it to be a feasible solution. 

I understand that Bitcoin Cash is a good thing for Bitcoin as hese different chains will greatly improve the development and decrease conflicts. However, as I said there seem to be tough challenges ahead. Would anyone mind explaining why increasing block size is the way forward and in general how Bitcoin Cash will succeed?"
"Not sure the ""centralised development team"" is correct, isn't there like over 100 developers and most of them aren't on the payroll of a particular company?"

* The most secure blockchain in existence
* Extremely resilient to attack

Compared with:

Bitcoin Cash:

* Secured by only ~200ph/s
* One miner controls 75% of all mining power
* Trivial to attack by bitcoin miners
* Extremely vulnerable to censorship and re-orgs"
A lot of misinformation here. **SegWit does not remove signature data from transactions.** SegWit creates a bigger block, and in the bigger block all transactions contain signatures. Transactions without signatures continue to be invalid and signatures continue to be committed in blocks. SegWit allows partial validators who do not check signature validity to do so without downloading the signatures themselves. This does not make invalid transactions valid. It does not make invalid blocks valid. It does not make invalid signatures valid. It does not make transactions without signatures valid. It does not remove signatures from blocks, as all block content continues to be committed in the block header. **SegWit simply lets you verify non-witness transaction data without downloading (then discarding) the witnesses, which solves the problem of light clients having to download things they don’t care about.**

Doesn't Bitcoin also have multiple client implementations such as BU, Bitcoin XT and Bitcoin Classic?
This is really great, straight forward and easy to understand. One question, I was under the impression btc was going to set the limit to 2mb in the next month or so, isn't that the plan?
I haven't been following, but is there a planned solution to fix transaction malleability and quadratic hashing in Bitcoin Cash? [Flexible Transactions](https://bitcoinclassic.com/devel/Flexible%20Transactions.html) or something else?
"So we're going with ""PowerBlocks"" over “FlexBlocks?"""
This is fantastic, great job.
It also removes covert CoreBoost.
Nice.
It has a lower level of security when compared to bitcoin in its current state. On-chain signature are a strong proof of ownership for the transaction inputs. without them on the chain, it is harder to trust the legitimacy of a transaction, and for nodes to verify them. 
And you chaps eat this shit up lol. 
Let's say Bitcoin Cash becomes the new Bitcoin. I want to go to a store and pay for a coffee to go. Transaction I suppose will be done fast, but the confirmation will take some minutes? So do I have to stay at the store until it gets confirmed? I am very new to Bitcoin and have never payed with it before so that is why I am asking. How did paying with bitcoin work before, when confirmations took like 5 minutes?
Just so I'm 100% clear, Bitcoin Cash is the coin that is trying to stay true to Satoshi's original whitepaper?

Excellent presentation, simple truths
"**SegWit Signatures** - SegWit signatures are still on the blockchain.  The difference is that if you want to discard the new signatures from your device, you can still calculate the TXIDs and then the block hash from the remaining data, ensuring all the payments have been built on by the miners.  There is no negative to providing that option.


**Development team** - Also there is no single development team for Bitcoin.  Competition between teams are encouraged and cannot be stopped anyway.  If another team makes an incompatible client, then that just creates a new coin.  This is true for both Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin 

**Blocksize**
Bitcoin is upgrading to 2MB blocks now"
yay i just finished dumping my bcash.
PowerBlocks? SecureSigs? LoL, SegWit is not about the name.
Anything to mention about mining?
Can someone play Devil's Advocate and explain what the potential downsides could be?
"Thanks for this infographic I'm finally starting to understand some of this but I have some questions.

I probably need ELI5 for some of these but
What's the thought process behind discarding transaction signatures from the block chain and allowing off-chain payment channels. 

Are they attempting to allow bitcoin equivalent of a credit card charge back?"
Doesn't a fork bring your existing BTC balance into the new chain?
Note that this is not official policy of Bitcoin Cash or the implementations (Bitcoin ABC, classic, XT or Unlimited) as long as it's not published by any of those projects.
Has covert asicboost been disabled?
First of all, you can still send a normal bitcoin transaction with Segwit enabled if you want to, it's just that Segwit transactions use less block space and are therefore cheaper. Second the Segwit signatures aren't dropped, they are verified and then hashed into one signature on the blockchain. This makes Bitcoin leaner and meaner as half of the data no longer needs to be stored long term by every node. Segwit also enables new kinds of signatures called Schnorr signatures which reduce the cost of transactions that move many inputs into one large output, a common problem for businesses. Because of this Schnorr makes it much more expensive to spam the blockchain. There are also a bunch of other big improvements, all designed to optimize the existing block space and resources. Bitcoin Cash has none of these things.
"Thanks. I will be including a mention of the off-chain capabilities of Bitcoin Cash in the next iteration of the infographic. The term ""unproven tech"" would be a bit subjective to put in my graphic, but you are right that it does not have a track record like on-chain transactions. "
While I can appreciate the weight of the vision of Satoshi, it is my opinion that a diverse range of client implementations would be more beneficial to the bitcoin network. This would spread out the risk of bugs, so that an issue with one client would not effect the entire network. If this is counterpoint to the view of Satoshi, so be it. I support the decentralization of bitcoin, and multiple clients is a way to achieve this end.
I agree with Satoshi, in a perfect world one single perfect implementation would be ideal. But pragmatically, satoshi would agree that you can't *stop* there being multiple implementations, so ultimately there will be.
"> So much of the design depends on all nodes getting exactly identical results in lockstep that **a second implementation would be a menace to the network.**

I disagree with him.

Some single implementation is more risky at many levels.

(Development corporate capture but also bugs that can take down the whole network..)"

Yes, and for small payments works fine without RBF.
No. Someone still has to mine that transaction and if all miners require a fee, a zero fee transaction won't make it in.
Yes, you can do that. And also you can use bits as a subunit of bitcoin. 0.00037=370 bits.
Only if you specifically marked the transaction as replaceable, which would cause the shop to wait for confirmations before approving.
"> singlespend

I like that. We have singlespend! Singlespend!"
RBF is an option, no one is forced to use it.
I am jawdropped that there is someone here with half a brain defending it, but his arguments are nonsensical...
"To continue his quote in his very next post:

> A second version would be a massive development and maintenance *hassle for me.*

The statement was made for purely selfish maintenance reasons. You already knew that though because it's been pointed out to you before.

"
Maybe Satoshi got right 95% of his vision about Bitcoin, and he was mistaken on this issue in particular. We have had several clients working in production for several years, and the network has been fine.
I like the concept of turning the bitcoin logo into a 'note'. An optical illusion makes the roundel seem larger than it is.

It's called **Bitcoin Cash** or **BCC** abbreviated. [Why is this important?](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6r4no6/its_called_bitcoin_cash_the_term_bcash_is_a/). **BCC** is the recommended ticker symbol on the [official website](https://www.bitcoincash.org) and used by all 4 current client implementations.
"> Segwit transactions use less block space and are therefore cheaper. 

This is deceptive.

Segwit creates a partitioned ""sideblock"" in which the witness data rides. The nonwitness data rides in the ""block"". Segwit does not decrease the total data payload, it merely performs this accounting trick so that shills can claim it ""uses less block space."""
That's my point. Usually the reader can't imply the benefits as they don't understand the function enough in context. 
Satoshi first included transaction replacement and intended for it be reimplemented.. Not Core's.
"> Normal BItcoin also validates all signatures, obviously.

They literally don't believe this, they'd rather believe Bitcoin Unlimited's ""Chief Scientist"" than actually look at the code. "
But then if you don't know what PowerBlocks or securesigs are you are lost anyway. I find all these explanations very good but they are intended for an already seasoned audience. There needs to be a complete newbie guide with definitions.
Are there actually more changes? Did they add any of Classics features like flex trans?

"As a relatively new user that lurks on both subreddits and consumes a lot of information about BTC, BCC and other Crypto related topics, I find your infographic pretty loaded and I'm afraid this sub is on it's path to become the same circlejerk that /r/bitcoin is.

"Instead of ""standard block size"" just write ""tiny block size"".

The standard would actually be 32MB, because that is what the first few releases of Bitcoin had, before the *temporary* spam limit of 1MB "
Satoshi is just a guy. Being the inventor of Bitcoin doesn't mean he necessary knows the best future approach for Bitcoin
This would appear true for just two, but each additional implementation may theoretically reduce that risk. Any two could result in an equal split, but if any one version out of many had a problem the remainder would likely stay in agreement.
Satoshi was obviously brilliant in many ways, but software engineering was not his strong point.
"I know this might seem like picking and choosing, but Satoshi was a great many things, just not a great programmer, and certainly not an expert in mission-critical, decentralised systems.

This is one of the few things I disagree with him on."
He is talking about ''core design'', Segwit is the menace because it has overwritten core designs in so many areas.
"tell that to luke-jr with his Knots imp then, or the guy who made bitcoin-qt which the satoshi client migrated to.

It's called evolution, and right now the core path is running it to extinction"
"Add the highlighting of how we brought back 0-conf too!

"Bitcoin with segwit fully validates all signatures . The info graphic discussing b cash is filled with lies - https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6r9y3p/bitcoin_cash_infographic_a_simple_explanation_of/dl4ogkj/
"
Bitcoin Cash's logo as shown in the diagram also includes the note background. This emphasises the cash part of the name. 
Define 'really great' in objective terms.
Yes, that is correct. The Segwit2X proposal currently supported by the mining majority intends to hardfork to a 2MB blocksize capacity 3 months after the activation of SegWit. However, this is not guaranteed, and is not actively supported by many small-block favouring members of the bitcoin community. It may not come to fruition. I sincerely hope that it does. If not, bitcoin cash has already expanded the block size, and will rightfully attract many big-block supporting miners in my view. 
It is the plan. Some people are trying to stop it, though, so there will probably be another chain split in November when it happens.
Malleability is on the roadmap.  This would require a hard fork and a new transaction type (as does SegWit, btw).
"Quadratic hashing is a red herring...
"
Both are equally valid, but PowerBlocks has a better ring to it in my opinion. The increase in block size allows for more network transaction power, so I chose to use the term. 
Thanks, just doing my part to help out. 
Covert hub/bank boost.
You forgot Core's toxic RBF. Its removed in Bitcoin Cash. A great relief.
Funny how this post is the only one not commented on yet. I guess that counts as an answer too.
Pretty simple: the legacy chain has the most cumulative hashpower behind it, and (to date) the fewest changes to the protocol (remember that SegWit is not active yet).
Perhaps it should be honest first - https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6r9y3p/bitcoin_cash_infographic_a_simple_explanation_of/dl4ogkj/ than we can compare the two
Some potential downsides of Bitcoin cash could result from the increased rate of blockchain storage size growth. This will make it more difficult to load full nodes into the future. Bitcoin cash also has a reduced developmental focus on off-chain transactions. This may slow the advance of payment channel technology, which allows for micropayment features. However, this technology is likely to emerge on Bitcoin cash eventually, but will not be as necessary as it would be on Bitcoin (Segwit)'s 1MB blocksize chain. 
The mining algorithm and mechanism remains unchanged. Bitcoin cash has dynamic difficulty changing however, making it more responsive to changes in network hash power. 
But they are lies - https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6r9y3p/bitcoin_cash_infographic_a_simple_explanation_of/dl4ogkj/
Good point, I will make this change in the next iteration.
Yes, it does. This is a point on my graphic that I should have made more clear. I meant to say that Bitcoin cash development teams are more decentralized than bitcoin development teams, due to the lack of control by bitcoin core. This will be readjusted in the next iteration. 
You should conduct further research of the features and benefits of both coins. While I personally favour the approach offered by bitcoin cash, it is up to you to decide which has more long term value.
I have tried to be reasonably impartial in the construction of my infographic. While it visibly describes Bitcoin cash as a protocol upgrade, I don't believe I have been biased enough to warrant dismissing it outright, as everything it describes is a true benefit. 
Well done. Very readable for the non-techie. PowerBlocks, SecureSigs--nice. Now, let the market decide!
"This is why I chose the word ""Owned"" specifically, referring to a sovereign wallet with private key access and control. "
The only bitcoin you own is the bitcoin for which you have the keys.
you should change the scaling plan.  BCC will support Off-chain channels also.
You might be right. My point about the centralization of bitcoin core is rebutted by the bitcoin compatible BU and bitcoin classic clients. The point I was intending to make is that bitcoin cash is not controlled by a majority client in the same sense that bitcoin core is the large majority of the bitcoin node count. I was trying to explain that bitcoin core is not involved with bitcoin cash, due to the negative connotations of bitcoin core, but I admit I could have been more clear on this point. 
"Competition is encouraged... please give us an example of this encouragement.

As for the 2MB upgrade, Blockstream seem to think it's not happening."
Good for you. I hope bitcoin (Segwit) works out as well as it is planned, I just think that bitcoin cash offers a better scaling model. 
"The ability to process 8x the transactions means there won't be a backlog.  A transaction will very likely confirm with the next block.  This is how bitcoin worked back before 2015.

The backlog created the higher transaction fees, and because you could not predict the fee needed to get into the next block you had to overpay.  To solve that problem Core created Replace By Fee, which let you write a transaction with a low fee then later resubmit it with a higher fee to get it processed quicly.  Presumably the only change would be indicating a higher fee, but it could also just not pay the merchant at all.

I equate it to using a pencil to write a check to the merchant, then rewriting it later.  (For those in locations that, luckily, don't use them, a check is a piece of paper with an IOU that the merchant could take to the bank to receive payment)."
The bitcoin cash chain has only been in existence for a few days. Once it has been settled, and exchanges are able to process deposits and withdrawals normally, it's price will likely promote new mining power to join the network. Many miners may choose to support bitcoin cash fully in the future, if the planned 2MB hardfork fails to occur. Ultimately its support by miners will depend on market demand for bitcoin cash, which I believe is more significant than you may be giving credit for. 
With bitcoin cash, you will be able to make a transaction, and have it be visible as a ZeroConf transaction within seconds. At this point it will be included in the next block and confirmed within 10 minutes. However, bitcoin cash removes the replace by fee mechanism. This makes it more secure for vendors to accept a transaction without waiting for it to be confirmed and placed into a block, as they can be confident that it will be confirmed shortly without being modified. 
they're eating the bitcoin marketshare and you're crying xd
I appreciate that you disagree with bitcoin cash at some fundamental level. What is the basis for you thinking that a voluntary, opt in, market weighted upgrade for bitcoin by hardfork is shit? If you disagree with bitcoin cash, you are free to sell it and buy bitcoin core. The choice is yours.
For a new chain supposedly doomed to failure, you guys are sure spending a lot of time and energy complaining about it.
Increasing block size is a vitally necessary change for bitcoin, as it is constantly at maximum capacity, making longer transaction times and higher fees. Full nodes are able to handle larger block sizes without any problems, and storage space costs are an insignificant barrier to adoption when compared with transaction fees exceeding $3 at the peak of the backlog a few weeks ago. Bitcoin cash provides this much needed block size boost, allowing more people to use on-chain transactions at a lower price. 
A lot of core fanboys don't understand the benefits of a heterogenous network of implementations. The more compatible yet different viable options there are the stronger the network becomes. The impact of any single vulnerability is diminished on a diverse network. Any attacker would need to exploit multiple 0 day vectors to take down the entire system.
I have no problem with Ethereum, but if storage is so worrying to you, you should take a look at the size and growth rate of the Ethereum blockchain.
If you include everyone who who submitted a single line of code ever then yes. However, the development process is very centralised and controlled by Blockstream.

Im bewildered how some user accounts believe this upgrade makes Bitcoin Cash an alt while the BS-Core coin is the upgrade.

Personally I like Bcash as a shortened version of the full name - Bitcoin Cash - as it provides a clear differentiation between the two, something I think is important to maintain."

I haven't been around Reddit for a good chunk of time, and on return, I am coming to realization and a complete shock about how much some people from r/bitcoin have degraded, and so fast. They are so very visible, just spamming around in all subs and threads with a short list of preset senseless phrases, while tagging themselves with the ""bc.."" word, right there on the spot. 

There is probably no need to do anything at this point simply because they already severely ""over-tagged"" themselves and r/bitcoin sub with the ""bc.."" word . Just take a look at the search results: https://www.reddit.com/search?q=bcash
In the list of top directories, **r/bitcoin** takes one of the **top spots by count, right there ,alone with quite a collection of subs with links to porn sites** (...""b_cash me ousside, howbow dah..."") They are basically already at the end of self destruction, self labeling and in fact self detachment from the word Bitcoin.

I would suggest mods of this sub to search and delete the ""bc.."" word from posts on this sub, including this thread (perhaps just put underscores).

I am sure there is lot of normal people over there, perhaps they will react, but r/bitcoin really starting to look more like a porn collection, with most top topics being just some recycled irrelevant to the project memes directed against Bitcoin Cash. I swear, the r/buttcoin probably has more relevant information about Bitcoin right now than r/bitcoin. Buttcoin is often right on the spot with their critiques, which are usually presented with good sophisticated humor.

P.S. I also happen to notice that the sub **r/Bitcoincash** has a header ""Just spam stuff"", so that one is hijacked too and I think **that this one needs to be recovered with the help of Reddit administration.**"

BitCoin Cash has a lot of people who previously dropped out of BitCoin edited though and it has the branding. It might take off. I think there is a (maybe not super long term) future for BCH. At the very least it will hang around a while as a lesson to the longer chain - listen to the community!"

I do not personally hate things like SegWit if good technical reasons can be given for it and it is tried and tested. The 8MB block increase is obviously very good. I see a future maybe. I hope it really crashes and I might even buy in a tiny bit (I do not hold any BTC, used it for transactions for years tho).

BCH is not a thread to BTC though. Either it dies, it's a side chain or it ends up representing the will of the vast majority of users and becomes the defect bitcoin. This is still new technology. I am not even sure bitcoin is even the coin of the future and not the technical testbed and predecessor to whatever currency will come out in a few decades time.

"I think that a big risk is that if BCH fails (the price is crashing at the moment), then the media might use the old name and say ""Bitcoin Cash has failed,"" which hurts the Bitcoin name. It's unfortunate that an alt-coin has tried to claim the Bitcoin name. Clearly on this sub, we are asked to call bcash ""Bitcoin,"" but this is fading away on mainstream exchanges and wallets.

The wrong people are moderating that sub. Read the OP.
I think /r/bcash makes more sense for bch enthusiasts than /r/btc...
"Sorry you're right. I am using wrong terminology. Like I said i have been mostly a bystander until now for a few years. I just would like something less corporate, you know?

Yeah nothing wrong with BCH. Personally I think hanging on to BCC is silly, let BitConnect have it. You can call it bcash if you like, just understand why a large part of the community dislike it. You can call it whatever you like."
"The website is an attack because it is based on the [official website](https://www.bitcoincash.org/) and all modifications are for the worse.

I found the stuff in my comment by simply following links. It is indeed likely that one person of a small group of people (i.e. censors of the bitcoin sub) is behind all of this."

I own bcash and prefer that name. Like Gavin, I will call it Bitcoin if it overtakes the hashpwer of actual Bitcoin. I'm surprised the /r/btc mods would restrict the words we use. I came to /r/btc to get rid of censorship :/
Wow, I did not know these things also happened.
"I mentioned this previously and was told that there is already a bitcash in japan so there is potentially that prior art to be concerned over.

But no question Bitcash is better than Bitcoin Cash. Bitcoin Cash is cumbersome because it contains both coin and cash in the same name and it will obviously cause crazy confusion for newbs."
"hows that website an attack? sems informative if anything.

How are the mods restricting your words...? I don't really care if some people call it BCash if it's widely known it is BitCoin Cash but no rule is telling you don't call it BCash. The community is having a discussion saying please don't call it BCash.

"5 Bitcash.  If you have a multiple of ""cash"", it's still ""cash"", not ""cashes""."
"Agree with some of this.  

I shouldn't have to preface this but I will; I'm running a BCH full node and can 100% see the hand of /r/Bitcoin behind the ""bcash"" attempted rebranding. Their sticky just after the fork just felt so wrong - all the talk of alts and ""this is off topic"" was just plain creepy.  

That said, I think the _Bitcoin Cash_ brand/naming was a bit of a mistake. Public uptake is a big deal and I can see it being confusing as hell. The surge in mistaken purchases before the fork of _BitconnectCoin_ is testament to that.  

What does _Cash_ add to the name? I guess I can see that it identifies _Bitcoin Cash_ as a transactional crypto rather than ""SWIFT on blockchain"" but anyone who understands what that means and the history behind it already knows what they are doing.  

For the public, it is a simple noun and carries nothing more than _coin_ or _digital_ or _block_ does.  

Should have just gone like _BitcoinPlus_ or  something (I'm sure there are better examples out there). Of course there was a lot of work and discussion behind all this that I'm missing, just at face value seems a little rushed.  

Someone mentioned _Bitcash_ and I like that as a snappier compromise, but no point changing now."
It's a marketing thing.
That's a casual name. Not an attempt to rename the coin officially. Read the OP again. You missed some points. Such as the entire post.
That's my boy
"/triggered!!

It's completely natural for human beings to shorten names for use in casual conversation and social interactions. 

With Bitcoin Cash, everyone I've spoken or listened to uses BCC, BCH, Bcash, or Bitcash during casual conversation.

I have no idea what the bcash sub is all about, but they certainly didn't come up with that name by themselves -- wasn't it Bitfinex who first described their BCH as ""Bcash""?

Whatever the case, trying to stop the natural use of all these nicknames is hilariously futile. I suspect you'll likely run into a little Streisand Effect along the way if you push back against this too much.

It could also be much worse -- at least they're not calling it BitCHcash..."
"regardless on its origin, i like ""Bcash"". typing ""bitcoin cash"" in full can seem confusing in some contexts, and is also a lot to type.

Bcash is way more elegant than BCH, and simpler than ""Bitcoin Cash"""

"Think of the MySpace effect.  When Facebook started to get traction, I thought ""What a stupid name for a service.  It's not a book of people's faces.  It sounds like some kids toy.""  

I'm still undecided about which fork of Bitcoin I favor most, but if you wanted to ""MySpace"" core, I'd pick a name that did not have Bitcoin in the name.  Bitcash, Bitcredit? Something completely different?  

There's interesting arguments on both sides about the true purpose and purity of the ""original Bitcoin"".  I don't think ""Bitcoin cash"" is a good name, just like Bitcoin Unlimited or Bitcoin ""whatever"".  I'm just thinking if there's these competing blockchains for a significant length of time, people will ask ""do you accept Bitcoin?"", and get a response of ""which one""."
"It's a marketing thing. Otherwise it wouldn't really matter.

Bitcoin XT

Bitcoin Classic

there are very few similarities, to say its based on bitcoincash.org is a silly. the original has about 20x more content and actual formatting. 
I thought r/btc don't care of names, xt, classic, bu, ec, bcash. Common, yet another renamed alt, no big deal.

BCash is no more Bitcoin than Namecoin is.
"> It's just a group of users who broke off from Whalepool's TS server after a ridiculous rift between the Whalepool admins

That is interesting. What was that rift about? Who was on which side of the rift?"
Too many posts about it here, people are just helping promoting the wrong name. Let's stop please. This post is enough.
See the OP. By launching a campaign about what they want you to call BCH.
Where can I buy some Bcash?
"LOL, what will them take 5 months?

Anyway, at least they will eventually add it."
Does Coinbase (the consumer platform, not exchange) support both Ethereum and Etherum classic? I haven't logged in for a while now 
"You could say the same about Ethereum vs Ethereum classic or Dollars and Australian Dollars...
I get your point, it's adding confusion... but for now it's the best we have."
Any estimate how much coins they need to buy?
"i would have thought coinbase was completely solvent by them telling their customers to withdraw their BTC in order to get their BCC. 

if they didnt have the BTC to back up a huge withdraw stampede, why would they make that statement?"
"Call them two different things? People who care to know the difference can spend the 2 minutes it takes to understand they are different, and that's really all they might care to know. 

Support them both. Drop support for anything that no longer is worth supporting. That is key, IMO, to maintaining a successful exchange."
"I think it's a bit early to get to those issues...  I means if you live in 3rd world country they do change their own currency every couples decades... that surely put a lots of confusion.

First the price of everything is mostly NOT in cryto currency but in fiat... then most wallet in the future will let you pay with the cryto of your choice."
"January 2018? Is it a typo? Withholding financial assets of customers for months without any good reason and being on the hook for customer's losses related to that delay. What a nice idea! That would be two lawsuits instead of one. One for the urgent release of assets and another for damages caused by delay after the fact.

I predict new management will take over this company before January 1, 2018.
"
No idea. But considering that they need 5 months to do this it must be a lot.
Nice work everyone, we are doing it.  Bitcoin Cash will be the restoration of Satoshi Nakamoto's vision!
Maybe this will be the first time ever that Coinbase under promises and over delivers.  
Some buying pressure coming from Coinbase to cover their fractional reserve. Seems to be a reason for the delay until 1Jan18.
"They didn't have. Didn't you hear of 12 hours delay in withdrawals falsely blamed on non-existent bitcoin network congestion?

https://twitter.com/coinbase/status/891378286722400256"
This is great news! Good job Coinbase!
"so perhaps a BitPay invoice will control the receiving address on both the BTC and BCH chain at the same time?

So whether you pay with either, it's marked as paid?

People get immensely confused if not. ""I bought Bitcoin, I paid for this, why doesn't it work?!"" Bitpay: ""Mam, this invoice is for Bitcoin Cash"". Her: ""What? I did send you bitcoin, isn't it like cash?"""
This is good for BCC in general as it gives more users access to it but is probably bearish for it's price in the short term as in a few months around half a million BCC will be brought into the market which will likely cause a large dump.
"**How will companies, such as Coinbase, navigate the confusion for consumers between ""Bitcoin"" and ""Bitcoin Cash""?**

this is one of my big concerns. Crypto is already confusing enough, how are people (not us reddit nerds) supposed to know the difference? (legitimate concern)"
Good point. They try to spin this delay as if it's something that should spawn confidence in their company because it is all to ensure security (sic!). The truth may be exactly the opposite. People should suspect that they run on fractional reserve hence the delay.
"What are you using? I'm having trouble getting any wallet to work right now and I've tried a few

Perhaps my host systems are jsut poor"
My point is that people that don't like something don't usually seek out the subreddit dedicated for it just to insult it unless they're trying to push an agenda.

Okay, but it is safer than 0 Bitcoin confirmations, which it what you'd have on a slower chain at that tims
Nah, most people will start using bitcoin one the non congested chain with big capacity. Why are you so bitter about it? Don't you have your coins on both chains anyway? 
Try it yourself, go buy something with LTC and then try buying somehting with Bcash or BCC or BHC or whatever you call it. Then report back and tell me how liquid the transactions were.
Wasn't it also insta mined?
Lot's of capacity, not a lot of miners.
spam bcc all you want, it just looks like adoption.
"Give it a try see how long you could keep it up, without bumping up fees and then hashing power to claim those fees and then the price.

Edit : The bitcoin cash network can already process 20-25 tx's per second, settlement bitcoin will do that when lightning is ready, in two weeks apparently."
No such thing as spam unless you want a centrally planned coin. All transactions must pay the going rate or wait. Good luck spamming indeterminate block sizes though.
"You means that 5000 additional lines of code only made to avoid a HF (which Bitcoin Cash achieved seamlessly) and which increases the capacity only by 1.7X under *certain* conditions? Oh and BTW LN doesn't need Segwit and will be implemented in Bitcoin Cash if it goes out of the vaporware state at some point.

The only thing left for Bsettlement chain will be off chain private Blockstream's solutions."
Yeah, I guess luck won't help being doomed. 
Makes me wonder how many BTC/XBTs and BCC/BCHs will go missing in the days and weeks to come... Is there any way for a wallet to validate an address as belonging to a particular chain? 
"> Nobody cares or knows bcash in the real world

> this bcash bullshit is some egoistic bullshit and will fade away pretty soon.

I won't be sorry to make bitcoin useable again. Now go back on your congested Bsettlement chain made for Blockstream Inc."
It's named Bitcoin Cash
I agree that blocks are a bit slow on the bcash chain and the exchange rate is a bit on the low side, but you are just trolling now saying it doesn't exist. 
? But BTC has been fine.
The point is that there isn't an ideal currency. Different currencies are good at different things and bad at different things. However, new currencies need to do something **new** in order to be justified.  BCH does nothing new.
"RemindMe! December 1, 2017 ""holiday season Bitcash popularity?"""
"What do you mean ""back up yet""? RBF has been removed so 0-conf is just as reliable as it was before Bitcoin Core implemented RBF. I'd still be a little careful though at least for the first week that the first BCC block has been mined. I heard that Viabtc for example requires 20 confirmations for BCC instead of the commonly used 6 confirmations for XBT. So people are still a little extra hesitant than usual."
"ETC will suffer the same lag if put through the same usage.

Don't get me wrong. I have high hopes for the two but a lot of work is needed to get the two into proper usage.

This exactly
"orrr coin.dance shows a few blocks each hour so ""every few hours"" is not correct."

Yup, yup ... you're still talking about fiction. Doesn't exist friend. 
1 satoshi per byte, so typical minimal fee would be about 200-300 satoshis which with current [bitcoin settlement] price about ~0.008$
"So I've only sent one transaction so far on this chain, for some reason the guy I was expecting to send coin to doesn't have a compatible wallet :-P and I reduced my fee to the lowest ""required"" fee of 0.00001000 BCC/kb and for some odd reason my transaction made it into the next block."
[deleted]
"You are describing the situation as it is today. What about in a couple years when there are many more users? Small blocks can only fit so many on-chain transactions. The rest of the transactions have to go off-chain or switch to a different coin. BCH allows more on-chain transactions. 

Unlike many people in this debate, I am unsure whether on- or off-chain scaling is better. With BCH we now have a real world experiment that will show which is better. "
"Lol ETH is far of being ideal currency. Can you make one tx paying to many addresses? (multiple outputs). 

Lets be real here. ETH was designed for smart contracts and it opens alot more risk than Bitcoin. Bitcoin only need to be best at one thing.... Money.

I like Bcash as an abbreviation. So I'm going to keep using it.
weak blocks are on their way for bcc.  10 second blocks that build into a 10 minute block.

"My talk on subchains unfortunately has terrible audio.

https://bitco.in/forum/threads/subchains-and-other-applications-of-weak-blocks.584/#post-7246"
I too have been frustrated with ETH recently, for the reasons you mention. ETC doesn't suffer from the same ICO load as ETH, so you can still make timely and cheap transactions on that network.
I was pretty disappointed by their ability to correct big crashes caused by new ICOs or related bugs. Too much power in too few of hands. If that were BTC then everyone would have learned their lesson. Now ETH ICOs are a scammer's paradise and everyone knows if stuff gets too bad then someone will fix it and recover coins.
Credit cards need > 3 month to finalize.
I think the point is the time you can transact in. For example, I can make a coffee transaction pretty much instantly with a credit card despite the 3 day settlement. On the other hand, waiting 10-15 minutes for a Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash transaction for a coffee is unacceptable, thus those merchants would have to accept 0 confs or some secondary payment layer like LN.
I sent BTC from my electrum wallet to bittrex yesterday and got 6 confirmations within 5 minutes.  Am I missing something why 15 mins for BCC is good?
"In the last 24 hours 27 BCH blocks were found instead of 144.

The difficulty was reduced to 26% of Bitcoin's difficulty 17 BCH blocks ago and so far staying there which was 10 hours ago. That's a projected 40.8 blocks per day or 35 minutes per block from the lowest difficulty.

False comments like yours blindly being upvoted represents this sub perfectly."
"For the first 3 months it will average 2 hours per block. This isn't an opinion, this is just based off of the difficulty. 

Edit: I might be wrong."

Exactly. That old bitcoin feeling is BACK!
Lol Well you are in luck, the good ol' times are back!
No we mean Bitcoin Cash!
Of course no-one is using the bcash chain. No such chain exists.
"Hey man no need for the apology. 0-conf is just short for 0 confirmations. Bitcoin and Bcash have miners that add blocks to the blockchain which are filled with transactions. A transaction is sent and will show up in the receivers wallet immediately but is not considered to be truly/safely sent or confirmed until a miner adds a block to the blockchain with your transaction in it. We call this settlement on the blockchain.

Visa does the same thing. The transaction goes immediately but it says pending in your cc account. Then a few days later the transaction is confirmed by a third party and the transaction is added to your bill. Visa confirms transactions in around 3 days. Bitcoin in around 10 minutes. And Bcash in around 45 min- hour (but is getting faster every day as the difficulty increases and hash rate goes up )"
"We still need faster blocks eventually, smaller and faster block [1min] is better than large and long [10min]. As it allow you to avoid large burst of verification (could improved with thin blocks though), when new block is found.

Also make variation less problem when you actually need confirmation but would like avoid wait 2hrs+ due variation."
thanks man, understood!
It's called **Bitcoin Cash** or **BCC** abbreviated.

"> We still need faster blocks eventually, 


not convinced about this, is 10min perfect probably not, I don't feel it is pressing though, are you familiar with Peter R's Subchains, I feel this addresses many issues with need for faster confirmation and variation in block arrival time see below. open to possibilities though.


> smaller and faster block [1min] is better than large and long [10min]. As it allow you to avoid large burst of verification (could improved with thin blocks though), when new block is found.


As you pointed out this is a non issue as Miner / Node has already verified each transaction already when it first received it, so verification is spread evenly over block time period. implemented recently with xthin/compact blocks.


> Also make variation less problem when you actually need confirmation but would like avoid wait 2hrs+ due variation


if the majority (sampled) of miners can PROVE that your transaction is in the block that they are currently working on, that goes a long way to mitigating this issue imo.


as to Zero-Conf it's all about risk management, add 1% onto your coffee prices for the 1% of double spends (exaggerated) , too low increase, too high decrease. simples.

Yes you can, but I recommend moving any Bitcoin to a new wallet first to avoid reusing a seed phrase.

Oh god I've been synchronizing the blockchain for the last 48h and it is still only in March 2017 right now... It's neither my bandwidth (I have plenty) or the ABC client because I tried running Core and it was just as slow... Maybe I'm just very unlucky with peers?
What happens if you sync against a copy of BCore blockchain? In theory, it should get up to the fork and then start downloading and following Bitcoin Cash, right?
Can I just add to that to up the cache ram if it isn't already. Default was 300mb on the old one, not sure if that changed but upping to ram til it's syncd massively reduced sync time for me.
"Umm. I literally said it wasn't working for me in the comment you replied to. 

Downloaded it, added my private key, balance shows, attempt transaction and it says unconfirmed. Tx ID doesn't show up on the chain explorers.

Can I import my keys from Bread Wallet on iOS to Electron Cash?

10 minute wait when I was first showing people Bitcoin a few years ago was the biggest complaint they had, Zero-Conf is important.


> Still trying to grasp on subchains.

me too. Peters talk helps if you have 20mins spare.


apologies if you already know this


basic idea, a miner can provably show what he is working on by publishing the hash with the greatest proof of work he has found so far + the block that it is relevant to and this can done at any time. 


**edit**. or it could be multiple hashes showing most proof of work. giving an even better estimate of how much work had been expended on said weakblock? 


would be appreciated if u/Peter__R or anybody could correct or give links to further info. ta

Probably because people are concerned they are not being open source.  They had some issues with their code being used maliciously.  I use their wallet, but just don't keep a huge amount in it.
It's called **Bitcoin Cash** or **BCC** abbreviated. [Why is this important?](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6r4no6/its_called_bitcoin_cash_the_term_bcash_is_a/). **BCC** is the recommended ticker symbol on the [official website](https://www.bitcoincash.org) and used by all 4 current client implementations.
Addresses are valid on both chains really, they will just have a different coin balance. If you enter the address on [https://blockchair.com/](https://blockchair.com/) it will show the balance on both chains.
I think its BCash now.  
I'm not doubting that transactions might confirm faster. I'm talking about the security. There are reasons for the 10 minute confirmation times, speeding it up does weaken the security. 6 Litecoin confirmations are not as theoretically secure as 6 Bitcoin confirmations.

bcash doesn't need spam, it's empty as is. So dumb, most exchanges won't touch it.
LOL, better get Butterfly Josh on that.

No teh world wont learn about bitcoin cash, they already used to bitcoin, good luck changing that, i check the delusional peeps like u here sometimes thinking bcash has a chance in the real world lol, retailers dont care about bcash nor do they care about blockstream, they just use bitcoin and not some other copy with a stupid name. im telling u, bitcoin is about to sky rocket after the bch demise and segwit activating soon, u are on the wrong side with tiny support.

"I believe he's pointing out that the correct name is ""Bitcoin Cash"", whereas ""Bcash"" is a social attack designed by Blockstream supporters to de-legitimize the coin by removing ""Bitcoin"" from the name.

"> ""holiday season Bitcash popularity?""

my cup of wrath is set to overflow ..."
wow so even though bcc is mining a block every couple hours, it's already possible to buy small items instantly.
And even then, if we wait the full 6 blocks/confirmations that's recommended by most, that 90 minutes is _far_ less time than 90 days.
This one always gets me. They think they are somehow excluded even though they are actively participating. Hah, stupid /btc'ers!
"> I don't see where BCH fits in.

think holiday season time ..."
"> not convinced about this, is 10min perfect probably not, I don't feel it is pressing though, are you familiar with Peter R's Subchains

Still trying to grasp on subchains. And I do agree it far from pressing issue even with current state of satoshi's bitcoin.

About Zero-Conf, I concur. Some users forgetting that taking cash at store is same risk management when dealing with small value bills at busy cashier"
"Lol what a pumper post.

1. You can pay 100 satoshis/byte for a 15-30 min confirmation on Bitcoin, this isn't really artificially limited.
2. Your title makes it look like Bitcoin Cash confirmed in 15 minutes which it didn't, just got lucky with timing.

Posts like OPs make me not like this subreddit. Sensationalism and heavily biased. Only thing positive about this subreddit is that they censor with downvotes instead of deleting threads."

"""This message has been brought to you in part by funding from Bitmain Tech."""
0/20 confirmations with high fee after 2 hours...it doesn't feel like Bitcoin at all, it feels like shit
"I use a Ledger Nano, and their native wallet works perfectly

Probably doesn't help if you don't own a Ledger, unfortunately, but for anyone else looking, or if you're eyeing one up..."
[deleted]
I didn't check if there's still some dust limits or something like that. I used less than 0.05mBCC and it was low enough to not even bother checking if I could get away with less.
yeah, but you have to manually create TX since that feature removed from core gui some versions ago, minimal fee is now 1000 satoshi per kB 
is 0-conf up yet?
"Yes, but miners have no obligation to process them.

There's a small intrinsic cost to processing extra transactions, both in a small amount of power use, but mostly because it takes a little time, during which you can in theory be beaten by another miner.

As such, we're unlikely to see many true zero-fee transactions, but they're low enough to be pretty much zero. A million dollars worth of BCH being sent for $0.30 seems cheap enough to me"
[deleted]
I sent to kraken as well, started an hour ago and 0 confirmations so far. can even see transaction id on block explorer... wtf
"Are you me? Sent around the same time, stuck on 3 confirms at bittrex. Now Bittrex has the BCC chain as ""blocked"" on their status."
Except when it takes hours to find a block even with only 26% of Bitcoin's difficulty.
"Have you ever heard of Litecoin, sure you have, well get this.  It's literally faster than BCC/BCH/Bcash FUD. 

Gasp."
Why high fee? You'd probably get it into the next block with  0-fee.
And how many people can do the same thing?  The only reason you can do that is because loads of people gave up.
I completely stopped using bitcoin core along with many more people I know. That's your clue on why it is working again for you. Good luck with Bsettlement's network effect. 
if the price goes up or someone spams the network, that will no longer be true
This is becuase blockstream stopped spamming the pool. We know what's happening. They want to make it look like their chain is superior now that they can be objectively compared. They will not fork to 2 mb either. 
"Thanks,

always enjoy your talks, even with bad audio it is worth persevering with."
The problem with Bcash right now is the long wait between blocks
Bcore is an altcoin.
[deleted]
"Bcash is for weak hands who don't understand the underlying fundamentals of bitcoin and what is supposed to represent, which is a store of value, not a day to day transactional currency.  
"
So you've sold your Segwit coins then ya?
15 minutes is still too long to confirm a tx
My tx is averaging 1 confirmation per hour for 6 hours.  I mean, I'm not saying BCH sucks, just that you aren't exactly pointing towards the benefits convincingly.
Sent tx with 1 sat per byte, it went through next block
why don't you use litecoin? they have even shorter confirmation
I think you got lucky, it is taking forever right now to get a confirmation. At least for me and several people I know.
Have you tried LTC?
Blocks are every few hours, if you got 1 in 15 min then you got pretty lucky.
What did you buy?
Where/which exchange you used for the trade?
"Send TX with only 5 SatoshiBCH per Byte, waiting block to be confirmed .-.

From a pro-Segwit"
Only going to get better!
"Wow, only 15 minutes to confirm a transaction. Awesome!

..."
i know its a cencorred shithole, but thats a retarded argument to not be in bitcoin, bcash wont matter soon.
And then block 478599 happened, we're currently at 250-minutes and still waiting for the next block to be mined.  I don't know how big the mempool is, but this can't be a good sign for the chain's overall health
Of the 32 blocks mined only 2 blocks where >1MB. Your transaction is not really mined faster because of big blocks.
"You must be new here. I suggest you to stop reading the censored shithole on r/bitcoin to have a clear views on reality. 

Welcome aboard ;)"
"Bitcoin is about growth, not stagnation.

Bitcoin was designed to replace legacy and inefficient payment systems, it wasn't designed to become one.

Anyone who advocates for smaller blocks is either misinformed or has a conflict of interest. Small blocks hurt Bitcoin immensely."
Not to burst your bubble, but I just made a bitcoin transfer with minimal fees that confirmed in the first block. All your post does is confirm the view that people in /r/btc have no clue.
"In the last 24 hours 27 BCH blocks were found instead of 144.

The difficulty was reduced to 26% of Bitcoin's difficulty 17 BCH blocks ago and so far staying there which was 10 hours ago. That's a projected 40.8 blocks per day or 35 minutes per block from the lowest difficulty."
Can you buy my bCash?
hmmm im so confused
"See, this is just not what Bitcoin is supposed to be like. There needs to be a healthy fee market. It's the only way to keep spam transactions like yours off of the blockchain. Ordinary people like yourself can't be trusted with your own money. You need to let a bank handle it for you.
"
15 minutes is still too much when a Visa confirmation takes 1 second.
It looks like you don't understand confirmations: If BCC has 10% of BTC hash power then an equivalent of 1 BTC confirmation is 10 BCC confirmations.
You saying all of this with blocks being only a few KB filled. haha. 
You should try ETC/ETH. Fees are super low and with blocks every 14 seconds, you'll get your confirmation much faster.
"Bitcoin is a A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.

Or are you suggesting it's not?"
">Not to burst your bubble, but I just made a bitcoin transfer with minimal fees that confirmed in the first block. All your post does is confirm the view that people in /r/btc have no clue.

Well then it is just anecdotal.

The segwit chain is meant to work with high fees by design. 

If you don't want that *(as you seems to suggest quick transactions low fees is good)* I suggest you buy some Bitcoin cash."
"even my transaction were completed within the 10-15 mins **sometimes**.

I just censored you with my down vote... 
"do I have to sync the whole wallet for it to work? I was lead to believe that Electron Cash would would but for some reason my tx isn't being sent to mempool even though I have electron cash server selected.
"
Wait, I thought there was no official client. Multiple independent implementations and all that.
it's link was removed from bitcoincash.org. that makes me nervous 
i thought their beta Trezor wallet for BCH was still disabled due to a bug?
Gawd I've missed that feeling. Since fees went bonkers on the old chain I've avoided transfers between my own wallets and had to optimize my fees based on when I needed confirmation. I'm obviously not the only one. Before I used to not even care because I could micro tip and still pay nearly nothing in fees.
change your thinking....blockstream's brainwashing campaign want you to think that all transactions need a fee.  bitcoin was built to be freemium for at least 20 years if not indefinitely.
Jfc that is too damn high!
1000 no way lol more like 5
Last block 4 hours ago, transaction already waiting for two hours. Yes... great speed.
Kraken isn't accepting BCH deposits yet. I hope you didn't just send them to a XBT address because your coin is lost then.
"Guess I needed the /s after all.

I heard ya. BCC isn't the only crappy, slow coin. BTC ain't exactly Visa either. These coins have no real future in commerce if they can't get this resolved."
Bitcoin Cash has SecureSigs, which Litecoin doesn't.
">Have you ever heard of Litecoin, sure you have, well get this. It's literally faster than BCC/BCH/Bcash 

Faster as in shorter confirmation times? I'm pretty sure its not quite the same, that is 1 litecoin confirmation is *not* as ""safe"" as 1 bitcoin confirmation. "
I didn't think /s was necessary, but it seems I was mistaken.
Dash is instant.
What? But I was told it would take months before hashing rate adjusts...
Uhh....how does this work exactly?
"The only reason you can do it is because no-one's using your altcoin (<<1000 transactions per hour), and the hashrate is being propped up for the lulz (it should be about three times lower).

Transactions are being included in blocks at fees of 1 (bcash)sat/byte currently, so it would cost a mere 0.04 bcash = $4 to spam an entire block full with dust."
"> I completely stopped using bitcoin core along with many more people I know.

Ofc, you're paid."
"Won't need luck. We got segwit ;)"
[deleted]
"Except all of the ones above 1mb. I'm sure it's all ""spam"" though"
How do these two exclude eachother?
Not quite how it works. You can charge-back on visa *months* down the line. Nothing is confirmed.
The Bitcoin mempool does not get emptied with each new block, so people are missing out on getting their transaction confirmed.
This is the most hilarious thing I've ever seen an rBtc detractor say. The only thing it proves is that you have no idea why there were problems with the bitcoin network and why fees were high in the first place. 
My first few transactions you think I had a clue? Regardless, you seem to discount the fact that some people can learn ...
bitcoin will solve the tx issue anyway so capacity wont be an problem, i know majority here just in it to make a quick buck, pumping bcash to dump, i dumped mine already and forgetting it, it has no future, only good to take a quick profit, dont be naive.
Delusion is strong here, since the spam attacks stopped you can get into any block on the bitcoin network for pennies. Also worth mentioning that the bitcoin blockchain is used by thousands of businesses while no one uses the bcash chain, no wonder you don't have to fight to get into blocks. 
"Was this big BCH fiasco worth getting a 15 minute trade? LTC and ETH can already do that or better. BTC is valuable because it is ""digital gold"": the most secure, time tested, largest hashpower, and yes- slower than ETH/LTC/BCH. ETH and BTC complement each other. I don't see where BCH fits in."
I made a transaction 3 hours ago. It unrefreshingly feels like crud since it was to an exchange that requires 20 confirmations... and it's been stuck on 3 ever since.
Wouldnt it be possible to send transactions without a fee?
I know, and I surely appreciate ETH for that too.
BCC has removed RBF.
unless, ICO
"before 0-conf was vandalized a bitcoin transaction propagated faster than a visa transaction. this is because there could be a node a few miles from you, while a visa transaction had to travel further.  

if you use visa cards with chips bitcoin is way way faster."
I hold ETH and ETC but I was pretty disappointed with their capacity when big ICOs happened.
"2 hours and still waiting here.
That's not bitcoin!"
No it's not. Credit card networks take 3 business days. Bank transfers can take 1 to 2 business days.
Difficulty will adjust with time.
"Alternative fact.

https://cash.coin.dance/blocks"
Yesterday, sure. Today, not really.
will be every ten minutes when more hash support comes, just wait 
It's not clear what you mean. Do you mean bitcoin cash?
Visa doesn't confirm in a second. They just accept 0-conf and take the risk. Or the merchant takes the risk. Settlement takes a few days. That's why charges are pending for a few days in your cc account before going onto your posted account.
"This is a wrong comparison. You can accept a 0-conf transaction in seconds, the same way you accept a Visa transaction.

Confirmation is when the transaction is finally settled in the ledger, which for Visa is when they do the actual bank transfers, which if I understand correctly happens every night. But this is not shown to the end user.

Please do correct me if I'm wrong."
"Thats not the point of Bitcoin! Secure Honest Unchangeable Trust-less Tokens ;)"
"It should be 10 minutes per block eventually, but yes, even that is slow. 

I think Zero-conf transactions should eventually be safe for small transactions with Bitcoin Cash, so pretty much instant for buying a coffee etc.

One step at a time, but I'll be very interested to see what roadmaps the developers of Bitcoin Cash put together!"
0-confirmation transactions work again on Bitcoin Cash.
"Dude. We just went over this. You can't seriously repeat that SegWit-with-witnesses is 30kb and SegWit-without-witness is 750kb unless you are comparing optimized (compact blocks) transfer with  non-optimized transfer which is plain silly.

Again, they cannot use a bloom filter because they would need to trust their peers. They can mine without validating as the only trust it requires is an attacker not wasting $30k. Do you see that difference?

Where or when did I give flextrans a pass?"
