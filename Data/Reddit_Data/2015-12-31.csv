I don't think they need to fudge anything to do it, I think it's possible for them to simply choose to not allow that advert.
"This guy said he was a mod and didn't ask for my password after fucking my mother?

He must really be a mod."
"It's a good start... I'd seriously be tempted to call out Theymos in another ad: 

""Discuss Bitcoin without Theymos' petty childish interference""."
Could you make it possible to do? I mean, so you can ban him after.
Excellent.

Also I'd like to note that anyone who disable subreddit style would see though. I usually prefer clean original style of reddit so I always disable styles.
I'm just commenting here because I clicked on the orangered.  Did you try refreshing the page a shitton?
How do you know?  I tried to view-source on my phone and it was painful.  Is there an easy way to read source for a subreddit theme? 
"They would undoubtedly remove him for that.

We must take into account that ads are shown to a particular user only every so often.

Find the offending css and it would be over, even if they changed it later (reddit keeps a record of past css)

**EDIT:**

https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoin/about/stylesheet/

I skimmed it and didnt see anything. I think the rotation of ads/non ads is what you might have been experiencing."

Try refreshing the page several times until you see the ad.  Ads are rotated

I like bigass ads.  I want the biggest damn ad possible, taking up a 1/4 of /r/bitcoin front page.  But I am considering my UX and CTA now..."
I get an ad for bitquick.co
I do but not every time. 
Yes.
Yea that small dick dude.
">  

Can you point to the exact line in the css. I cant find it.

Holy shit actually? This might be the mistake that finally removes him from control of the sub
I would post evidence or edit your comment. It doesn't appear to be true.
"Yes.  See https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/205701235

Watching/seeing an ad is always an unpleasant surprise. Then it gets extra weird when family+friends are so plugged into the advertising system that they brag about being able to tune them out. As if putting yourself in the perfect frame to be advertised to is desirable.

Can it be reported?  Can he be removed for violating Reddit rules? 
The ad was being hidden yesterday right after the form loaded, but today the ad is not being hidden. I think someone communicated the fact to whoever did it that the mods are not allowed to mess with Reddit ads.
Users scan pages for information, not read. Verbose headlines gets ignored. OP's screenshot's headline is an excellent eye catching headline. Most users do not understand nor care about the intricacies of XT. Thanks for the ad,  I think putting ads is a great step to show users there are other avenues for censorship free discussion.
Got it, thanks.  A couple users already clued me in...
Thanks.
Thanks.
He means: Too many words.
"CTA = Call To Action

I think he means that what you request of the reader is not sufficiently simple, clear and doesn't stand out enough in that context."
User experience and you're being too verbose 
Cool. Whats UX and CTA? Ad terms? 
Did they catch 4chan yet?
"> Are there any restrictions on what I can do with my subreddit's CSS?

> You are pretty much free to make any style modifications you would like, within reason. Some things you can't do:

I would just like to say as a UXer your CTA is quite weak. It has to be shorter and more concise.
"I'm on mobile and it doesn't. Which is why I made the joke; because I was powerless :-/

Edit: I Trusted though, because I saw others had already commented and upvoted."
"Maybe a 3D ray-traced wizard?

Though my thought at the moment is we want to push the openness and free discussion aspects. The one that occurred to me was three of the little reddit dudes, one with a core logo, one with a XT logo and one with a BU logo all cooperating to hold up a large bitcoin between them. I can't see quite how it would work though."
He can probably do both at the same time, since he has 2 keyboards like that hacker 4chan.
The upvotes are only that.  The ads are rotated, individual ads are shown based upon a number of impressions, start and stop times, and reddit doesn't have any individualized tracking that I know of for the subreddit ads...
I guess, its not css related.
"I see the ads.  The report of their removal was an exaggeration.
"
"I would love to see this advertised all over the place. ;)"
It will be funny then newbs will try to make submissions about the ad or mentioning this sub and they will get banned and censored.  Then maybe they will realize they are in North Korea.
I've ran [these](http://imgur.com/8uRCxhh).  They have to either not care, or can't do anything about it.
If you view a user's profile, you can verify what subs they mod, if any.
He would even ban satoshi if he could.
Does he have to ban encryption first before banning the internet?
Sorry I was just reporting what I saw further down on this thread. If you scroll down you'll see them talking about him removing it using CSS.
"What effect does upvoting an ad on Reddit have?

Does it make the ad appear more often for everyone? 

Or just tell Reddit you like the ad so they can personalise which ads they show you? "
I was assuming that is why the ad has stopped displaying, but it could be for another reason. Not sure why else it isn't showing up anymore.
"No reason to apologize at all. Not even a little bit.

If they hide ads with css, they will have to deal with reddit admins. If I were them and didnt like the ad, I would contact reddit admins, but I dont think they have a genuine case for asking it to be removed.

Hiding any ads with css isnt in their best interest."
The add is a bit too spammy, a shorter statement may be more effective? 
Maybe just the wizard with the /r/btc instead. Someone edited the image a while ago but I couldn't find the post.
Mod here. He can't stop it.
awesome, lol.
This is awesome!!!!!
Theymos?

"But what if he does the opposite? Runs an ad here saying ""want to discuss bitcoin in a way that furthers a narrow viewpoint far removed  from Satoshi's original vision? Come to r/bitcoin!""

"Dude, you're awesome.

I just tried to take out some ads on both /r/Bitcoin and /r/BitcoinBeginners, but apparently they're both booked solid for the next 4 months.

Also, holy shit, I've had adblockers running for so long I forgot there are supposed to be ads at the top of the page, lol.

Just pulled up /r/Bitcoin on a different browser, and sure enough, your ad was there. Good job!"
"Awesome.

https://np.reddit.com/r/subredditads

Looks like we can create a 300x250 image and have it pop-up occasionally like the /r/bitcoin one does. I'd like to see something inclusive rather than hostile though.

It needs a mod's involvement so anyone willing to step up to the plate? (or just make me a mod ;) )"
Straight to the point, without being overly dramatic/accusatory.  Well done.

You should launch a funding campaign. I will certainly contribute.
What's it cost to run the add for that long? We should crowd fund ads until that place is a ghost town.

I'm hoping it happens the other way around.  :-p"

"Is ""Fight censorship, mine bip101"" consise enough? Or is it misleading because it changes the CTA from ""click this subreddit link"" to ""buy thousands of dollars worth of equipment and point it at this one pool that gets DDoSed repeatedly""."
