Having a phone does not mean having a smartphone, let alone a decent/working internet service, let alone knowledge about cryptocurrencies, let alone having wallets/services for those in your language, let alone people you can use it with.
It is, because if you'd like to send someone money from outside the country, BCH has fees less than a cent, compared to a bank's transfer fee.
Oh wow. So much easier than, you know, just using fiat.
"That's why [CoinText](https://cointext.io) exists.

You can use a phone with only texting capabilities, only needing cellular service (otherwise, why would you have a phone), with easy conversion rates when sending in the local currency to BCH, with the only knowledge needed being how to send and receive with your address, with easy compatibility with every phone number listed on the page."
There are more people that have phones than toilets.

I call it bitcoin cash, AND I think it is the true contender to the bitcoin name. When talking to new people, I always explain that bitcoin is meant to be cheap, fast and reliable peer-to-peer electronic cash, and that following the chain split in August 2017, both bitcoin core and bitcoin cash are contending to be the real bitcoin. BTC is the incumbent chain that kept the ticker, while BCH kept the original design. Nothing is forced, but it is better to make people aware of the differences.
"BTC= BCORE
BCH=Bitcoin Cash

Dont even give them the respect of having bitcoin in the name. Either call it BTC, or BCORE. That's it."

"Sure it is.  If we just don't take it as an insult but treat it as just the obvious way to shorten the name that it is then what does it matter how it started?

As someone else pointed out here people are probably going to shorten the name anyway because that's what people do and this is the obvious way to do that.  The general public will not know or care that was originally said as an insult.  

Why should I be offended by that anyway?  Oh no, they shorted the name of a coin I like, such outrage.  Who gives a crap.  We should just laugh at them for not being able to come up with a better insult and use it anyway.  Then what do they say?  They would have to come up with a new insult I guess.

And brigaded. Surprise surprise. BTC fools can fuck right off.
"I call them Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Core, adding the “Core” simply to differentiate when talking.

I’m also not a hardcore supporter of either, but see both as legitimate contenders for the Bitcoin “brand”.

When explaining it to someone, I just tell them that it has split due to differences over scaling, and that I have no idea which approach will win in the long run."
No it's not negative. Saying BTC, which was one of my options above, is not negative. BTC is a well recognized and accepted term for the token. Telling a BCORE supporter to their face you're not respecting them is negative. Simply choosing to refer to it as BTC is not negative in any way, regardless of your motivations for doing so.
"The original bitcoin was adding Segregated Witness and refusing to increase a data variable. 5% or so of the Bitcoin community disagreed with the SW upgrade and the artificial limit as well as beating around the bush of upgrades to the protocol in general -- this minority or so of the community decided to Fork before SegWit was added. Both coins effectively changed in Aug 2017. Bitcoin cash re-added old functionality, while the Core dev team pushed a propaganda machine promoting off-chain transactions called the Lightning Network.

tl;dr - Both are effectively forks."
"You have that all backwards I think.

BTC added contentiously: Replace By Fee, SegWit as a soft fork, and keeps a 1mb block size that was *never* supposed to remain, and *disabled* opcodes or crippled them.

BCH *removed:* Replace by Fee, removed SegWit \(or never had it depending on your perspective\), and in May is fully restoring the *original* 32mb maximum threshold it had on day one, and enabling and restoring the opcodes to BCH can be a platform again.

BTC is the one that drastically changed what it is, why should it keep the name? BCH is restoring the project back to the roots of the first version of it to follow the original whitepaper and roadmap that BTC abandoned.

Bitcoin is an altcoin wearing a stolen brand and does not deserve to be just *Bitcoin* anymore, created by a soulless private company called Blockstream that captured Bitcoin development to twist it into something they can make money off of as just more middlemen. This is the antithesis of what Bitcoin was supposed to be."
"Yup. The problem with ""bitcoin cash is bitcoin"" is that unless you have the full context of Bitcoin's dirty history, this phrase sounds pretentious and confusing. It seems like something is indeed trying to ""steal"" the brand to an outsider. Its important to remember the whole world are not trolls, a lot of them are simply misinformed. This crede works between Cashers but not so well in the real world outside of us.

Like, I understand what that means in that Bitcoin Cash is the direct continuation of the original project because Ive been around Bitcoin intently for 5 years now, but 90&#37; of most coiners now don't understand or know that. Our first coin was BTC, their first coin was probably ETH or now even others like Nano. They don't give a shit and most will never look beyond surface trolling, and never will unless BCH offers them something they want.

It just isn't effective marketing to continue using such a phrase that way as a practical matter to improve PR a bit, though I fundamentally agree with it.

The best advertising for BCH is *build shit on it that is useful to people.* Make more [memo.cash](https://memo.cash)'s. we don't need a fancy ad campaign, just build something that fucking works and people want, and the users and adoption will come. "
"That's the thing you see - they both start with the same Genesis block. Their history is identical through Aug 1, which is the first time when they diverged. So neither came first - they just chose different paths 8 years after the original Bitcoin came into being.

So it's less like dominoes vs papa John's, and more like the original AT&T (ma bell) splitting up into SW bell, bell atlantic etc."
"The ""Bitcoin Core"" thing is just Roger Ver  spreading propaganda that Core is out to kill bitcoin for profit. That would be like calling bitcoin cash, Bitcoin ABC.  

Bitcoin Classic or Bitcoin Legacy would make far more sense. 
"
">  The correct way is to start calling BTC ""Bitcoin Core"" so as to enforce the idea that there are ""flavors"" of bitcoin. 


Yeah basically.  I tell people there are many different types of coins, BCH, BTC, bitcoin gold, eth, LTC, monero, etc.  So you should pick which ones you like and look at reasons like speed of transaction, cost of transaction, do you want a private or public ledger, etc.  "

"Concern troll post #137

I have no problem with any name, don't even mind bcash, was never sure why everyone was so certain that naming conventions play anything but a signaling mechanism for rubes.  Fundamentals matter and branding is more like textual criticism for the religious zealots of which crypto has so many that they must be fed, so mythology and folk lore will be reflected in the history.  
"I call all hardforks of the original chain ""The Real Bitcoin"".   I see the core code as the Linux kernel of decentralization networks.  There is no ""real"" Linux, so why would we try to name a ""real"" Bitcoin?

All this talk about what is real and what isn't is purely subjective.  Can we just keep the conversation focused on which bitcoin or altcoin has the most utility instead? "
This is also how I usually go about it.
I don't follow the logic.  So, before Bitcoin Cash there was Bitcoin.  Someone then altered the Bitcoin code to create a spin off of Bitcoin called Bitcoin Cash.  The original Bitcoin didn't change code, right?  So I guess I don't understand the argument that Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin...  I don't really care to be honest, we accept BTC, BCH, LTC and ETH and hold them all...  
[deleted]
there is only one bitcoin, its not a competition for the name. bitcoin and bitcoin cash are both great products but there will only ever be one bitcoin project, everything after that will be a descendant of bitcoin. 
Sure, if that’s what you want to call them then it’s your prerogative.  The BCH community is clearly taking a stand to establish a differentiating names for the different types of Bitcoin. If the ETH/ETC communities had also chosen to do so it would have been their prerogative as well.
"The only other Linux comment I see is pointing out the opposite of what you said.  Linux implementations are referred to by their implementation. There is no one Linux implementation that’s just called “Linux”.

If you tell someone you run a Linux machine, the most common question you get (from my experience) is “which implementation/flavor?”"
Ok
Why do you call Bitcoin anything else? Bitcoin Core is a software, if you want to call them equal then use Bitcoin Cash ABC when you refer to BCH.
"God forbid someone that’s not a rabid BCH supporter post anything about it, eh?

"
How will it be peer to peer when with full blocks, only data centers can transmit( bandwidth doesn't follow Moore's law like storage costs do). Running a full node and transacting with another full node is the peer to peer part of satoshis vision.
"Hmm... You should probably know that I label myself a design paper fundamentalist...

Imo contradicting the paper really is the big disqualifier. That doesn't mean that it can't be complemented or expanded on, such as Satoshi did with the very first software version, but it's the basic blueprint and reading it like one certainly takes the previously mentioned logic.

I wish it was simpler than that. That only accumulated PoW was important. ""Trust me on that one""."
Dogecoin is the real Bitcoin for me, so I refer to Dogecoin as Bitcoin. 
"I wish folks like you were more vocal and took a leadership position in the group.   So simple and logical.  And no instant name calling when someone ""trolls"" you.    For real, spread your reason :)"
Eventually though bitcoin and bitcoin cash terms will be synonymous when bitcoin becomes the minor chain.  BTC will probably be termed “bitcoin classic” or “bitcoin core” or maybe not exist at all. 
"Exactly.

It'd be absurd for only BTC to be able to be called 'Bitcoin' while BCH be torn down for calling it 'Bitcoin'. But then, we are in an absurd situation..."
It's more of marketing thing.  Look at all the reactions and attention Bitcoin Cash gets because of it.
I sometimes think even embracing the 'bcash' would finally take away what seems like a weapon from BlockStream. In the end, the name doesn't matter nearly as much as how it performs ...
"Not entirely following the logic.    You admit the money part is important, thank heavens.    But, why hung up on Bitcoin, the name, the brand, being the most critical end goal.   Think about it, if Bitcoin Cash becomes more valuable, and is on its way to the original bitcoin chain dying off, haven't you already won?   You got the money part you first mentioned.   You succeeded in growing the value of the coin and users, without needing the sole Bitcoin.   

Unless the path to success does include some trickery in gaining adoption because it's a flavor of Bitcoin, which has some magic power.   It's a weird one to think about.   But no one right now cares to think about the dichotomy between the flavor name the the original name.      Also, if BCH ever does win and original btc dies off,  you still have the BCH ticker.     
"
Using that logic we should have Ethereum Foundation and Etherium IOHK? 
"Here is a description of the competitive aspect as follows (the video was made before the existence of Bitcoin Cash):

""After a hard fork: If fork was meant to start an altcoin, altcoin goes its separate way, branches coexist nicely

**If fork reflected a fight over future of Bitcoin**: branches fight for market share, branches fight to be seen as 'the real Bitcoin', probably one branch wins, the other melts away""

45% of the community were signalling Emergent Consensus. More than SW. It took them 2 years and a bait and switch tactic to get SW activated.
Except the core developers and not working on Lightning in any way.  Lightning is basically Core outsourcing the scaling problem to Lightning Labs and Blockstream.
Segwit wasn't a hard fork. You never have to use it in your life if you want to use Bitcoin. Calling it a hard fork is just factually incorrect, regardless of whether you need to call it one to fit your narrative.

"I understand that you’re trying to make a parallel between calling it the name of the development team, but it’s moot. There needs to be a way to differentiate between types of bitcoin, and since BTC has only one development team it is the obvious differentiating theme.

If you’re upset about this, try to start a competing BTC development team and see if you can get acceptance of any commits besides spelling/grammar corrections."
You have a point, but BTC is clearly Core’s project and they have yet to propose an alternative name. Their scaling plan was synonymous with “Core” since before BCH was a thing. In the face of that, “Bitcoin Core” works just as well as any of the options you proposed, if not better. 
Are you ignoring the other clients?
"You're wrong actually. Check out this article from Gavin: http://gavinandresen.ninja/are-bigger-blocks-better-for-bigger-miners

Big blocks are actually BAD for decentralization, and in a pretty dramatic way. The bigger the blocks, the more profitable the biggest mining pool becomes. So, joining a mining pool other than the largest one will actually mean losing money. Good luck convincing people to voluntarily give up profits. Gavin used two assumptions to come to the conclusion that big mining pools were up to .3% more profitable than individual miners/small mining pools: there was a cap on transaction size (There isn't in BCH) and 20mb blocks (BCH is 32mb and will eventually grow exponentially larger). So, that .3% is inevitably going to balloon up.

This is why Roger has argued in the past that decentralization is not a core tenet of BCH. He knows that BCH is going to be much more centralized than Bitcoin. This is always why I personally don't get why BCH supporters always try to compete with and slander Bitcoin - they're two completely different ideas at this point and aren't really competing. "
wait, am i reading this correctly?   a bch supporter that doesn't quote the whitepaper as an immutable and everlasting truth?   I'm just messing with ya, but it's refreshing to see.    Others, please take note ^.   And take this concept and keep applying it, that's how all software progresses.   
"Not sure what you're talking about, so probably not... If you're being ironic, I suggest you reevaluate the work Satoshi put into the design and consider how little was actually about the software itself. 

Scaling on chain is progress btw."
"i mean, take a look at bitcoincash github and then bitcoins.    one i a graveyard with 1 developer taking the lions share of all commits.    

and i get alot of your points, i just dont think it's that simple.     BTC could have tried to be aggresive and competed with ETH and guess what, maybe it loses.   You can't assume first mover's advantage means a certain win in every path you take.     I'm too tired to think right now, but i fail to see where disappointment comes in with BTC not doing xyz, when another currency is doing it.   Unless it's about money and investments?"

"It's not negativity. It's simply not granting the title Bitcoin in their name. You either say ""BTC"" (if you want to be polite), or BCORE (if you don't). But never reference their token with the term Bitcoin."

there are flavors of linux (red hat, ubuntu), much like there will be flavors of bitcoin (cash, gold)

there will only ever be one linux and one bitcoin source code repository that the offspring start from though..

as the Bitcoin Cash (Bitcoin ABC) github even states ""Bitcoin Cash is a descendant of Bitcoin. """
How it started isn't relevant, and I get that others disagree.  I don't expect that to change, I think this is the only time I have actually seen someone else express that feeling and I thought I would let them know they are not alone.
You might be right the general public who will mostly not know or care about the troll will probably use the same obvious shortening of the name trolls do.
Hard fork/soft fork are the wrong way to look at this. The question is whether segwit introduced an incompatibility into the protocol that affects the entirety of how blocks are interpreted. An old node will not reject a segwit block, nor will it crash, but it will also fail to update its utxo set in the same way as newer clients. So, it is definitely a material change to the protocol.
PoW is apolitical and mathematical and deterministic.  Its is the best mechanism to decide what is Bitcoin.  All that you stuff you mentioned (as much as I agree with you) it is *your* opinion.  Someone else may believe in their heart that BTC *is* Bitcoin exactly because it has capped size and segwit.  So you want to argue with someone till the end of time go ahead.  But I would get behind an objective measurable way of determining Bitcoin.  
Correct.  But if Bitcoin Gold gets more PoW (I know it uses a diff algol - just making a point) I would not be frothing at the mouth when they decide to take the Bitcoin brand.  Just for the sake of argument, if the world decides to call Litecoin, Bitcoin - then it *will* be Bitcoin.  Ultimately its what users call a coin that matters.  Right now BTC has the PoW and users calling it Bitcoin - so BTC *is* Bitcoin.  No argument there.
"I think eventually if Bitcoin Cash becomes the/a dominant crypto currency, most people will just call it Bcash. It'll be like a nickname. Like a Dollar is a ""Buck."" 

Everytime someone asks the price of something, they are gonna wanna say ""that's .05 Bcash"" not ""that's .05 Bitcoin Cash."" Just saves time. 

Right now, Bcash is sort of somewhat an insult. But I'm pretty sure it will become a sort of nickname eventually. Just for people's natural tendency to do such things for the sole reason of saving time/making something easier or catchier to say."
"Don't start cash, won't be cash ;P"
not intentionally, i didn't realize the other ones were used.  makes more sense now
not being ironic.  many in here cling to the whitepaper itself, as all there ever was and is.   im being genuine that you are logical
"1. Because it is different from the original bitcoin.

2. Because unlike bitcoin cash, prominent core devs have stated on the record that the protocol is definitively implemented only by the core client and any other client would have to be bug-for-bug compliant.

3. Because both core and cash are offshoots of, and contenders to the title of, the original bitcoin. Each can claim to be the real bitcoin, and ultimately the market has to decide (or continue to let each group call its own coin the real bitcoin)."
"Making a peer to peer transaction (to exchange value) does not require either party to be ""running a full node"" (mining, relaying, verifying)."

"It’s not, whenever he talked about “full nodes” he meant mining nodes. 

Satoshi quote from https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=532.msg6306#msg6306 :

> The current system where every user is a network node is not the intended configuration for large scale.  That would be like every Usenet user runs their own NNTP server.  The design supports letting users just be users.  The more burden it is to run a node, the fewer nodes there will be.  Those few nodes will be big server farms.  The rest will be client nodes that only do transactions and don't generate.


And this is exactly what’s happening. Miners are the ones running full generating nodes in data centers all over the world. And they always will, because they are the ones who stand to lose the most money if someone tries to cheat them."
">Running a full node and transacting with another full node is the peer to peer part of satoshis vision.

It most certainly is not that simple at all. This can be seen in the design paper itself, but if you find it unconvincing you can look up the private email correspondence and the public forum posts Satoshi made to explain the topic to those that doubted Bitcoin would scale."

lol read my comment again.
"> If we just don't take it as an insult but treat it as just the obvious way to shorten the name that it is then what does it matter how it started?

Because the entire thing is about trying to disassociate Bitcoin Cash as being directly related to Bitcoin. Conjecture of the future of the general public is irrelevant. 

'bcash' is an insult by hostile people and always was,  and should be treated as such, not given any merit or teeth. "

"That argument goes both ways. BTC has very little in common with the original bitcoin, but has decided to keep the name and ticker of original bitcoin for the sake of capturing the network effect of users and “marketing” of the original.

To make an analogy, it’s like selling coke-branded bottles that are filled with some other type of cola (let’s call it Core cola), and then calling it coke. Meanwhile you have the original coke formula which was forced to give up the original packaging when the brand was essentially hijacked by Core cola.  Of course the bottle filled with actual coke should be the one referred to as coke, instead of the coke bottle that’s filled with core cola."

"I don't mind calling BCH ""Bitcoin Cash"". What I don't like is calling the hijacked Lightning Coin ""Bitcoin"". "
Probably not, but we need the bitcoin name, fighting for it is the right thing to do
"I'm fine with it and even BCash.  Hell I prefer BCash.  The fight for Bitcoin name is unnecessary and almost childish.  Neither BTC or BCH are true bitcoin in my opinion.  Bitcoin is a concept, an idea.  Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Cash are two separate implementations of that idea.  BCH shouldn't be trying to win over a Bitcoin name, it should be focused on proving why it is the best implementation of digital currency idea of bitcoin.

Sadly this type of post would get me banned at /r/bitcoin"
"the analogy holds up because that is how software works, bitcoin will always be bitcoin and anything else is bitcoin.X

in the *what if* scenario i would still call it bitcoin and bitcoin cash.  industry does not refer to redhat as 'linux', its redhat"
"A soft fork and complete change of direction of the project while attempting to keep the name and ticker was ""forced pushing."" Bitcoin Cash is in fact rightfully named Bitcoin (BTC) and it should be most embarrassing for Core to be exposed as running away and doing their own thing with community property."
I agree. This name calling game is doing more harm than good right now. People need to learn the difference. Forcefully claiming the name is just leaving a sour taste in people's mouths. 
The real problem isn't even the name. Bitcoin cash is bitcoin, not at an altcoin. But when you mention this to anyone they think you are inferring bitcoin cash is THE bitcoin. 
I actually like the name Bitcoin Cash because it keeps reminding everyone what Bitcoin should be all about... as Cash for the entire world. Sometimes, people need daily reminders why Bitcoin Cash.
"As long as there are multiple relevant forks, all of them need some way to make it clear which line you are talking about, as any of them can rightfully be referred to as “bitcoin” when the context makes it clear (or when the particular fork doesn’t matter [e.g. saying “I just bought $100 worth of bitcoin” to someone who doesn’t know the first thing about crypto]).

As such “Bitcoin Cash” is fine w me. You can refer to any fork as “bitcoin” so long as the people to whom you are talking know what you mean. But when discussing multiple forks among people w different beliefs and ideologies (or among strangers), “Bitcoin” by itself (capital B) is ambiguous. It would be like referring to your favorite linux distro as “Linux” when comparing pros/cons of Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, etc—you may feel justified, but everybody else is going to be confused. To be sure, you will be sacrificing clarity in favor of a (pretty weak) political statement."
Either way it shows that there's no consensus on how a consensus is formed. Fantastic.

"I call it ""Bitcoin Cash"" when referring to it specifically by name but ""Bitcoin"" when referring to the technology, movement, etc.  Though I'm usually not referring to BTC when talking about the latter \(because BTC doesn't much work as Bitcoin anymore\)."
"I call it Bitcoin because I'm lazy.

Then I have to explain why Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin. It's like a filter. "
I don't mind it being called Bitcoin Cash. I call it that myself most times. I mind when people say I can't call it Bitcoin.
I would prefer it to be called Bitcoin Cash indefinitely. As someone who owns only Bitcoin Cash.
Ideologicalally Bitcoin Cash is closer to Bitcoin than Bitcoin Core is, but it's not good PR, very obviously.
"maybe someday just ""Bitcoin"" would not need clarification, but today that's ambiguous. I can agree bch is the best Bitcoin, but the word by itself would no longer be sufficiently meaningful. Maybe in the years after the lightning network/core hype train runs aground, but not yet. 

I do get a kick out of seeing the argument made, though, despite that it's really only speculative and couldn't be settled. Time will tell whether people want the superior technology or the incumbent"
Bitcoin Cash is correct. Eventually however both Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin name will be synonymous when BTC chain becomes the minor chain.

"My opinion on this is that it doesn't matter what a coin/token/currency is called. To me, the important part is functionality. 

I want the one that is the easiest to use for the purpose I need to use it for, whatever that may be."
It's the other way around, if BCH is the superior coin and it's true to the original then letting a less true fork fail will damage Bitcoin's reputation by association.
"correct, there are different types of linux and there will be different types of bitcoin.  there is one linux (core) build and one bitcoin (core) build that spawned those flavors, there is no semantics to argue, it just is.

much like linux is to redhat linux, everything after bitcoin is a different flavor of it, bitcoin cash being one of them."
I like Bitcoin Cash name because I'm usually calling it Cash then I talk about crypto with friends. I hope in near future it everyone will call it just CASH and not Bitcoin. It would be super cool
"this

bitcoin =/= bitcoin cash"
Bitcoin Cash it is. Chain split is unresolved, two Bitcoins are fighting
"u/chaintip $.50

Exactly this. Success will come naturally. Or even failure. 

Trying to convince everyone that BCH is the ""real"" Bitcoin just confuses people that know nothing about crypto or the BCH/BTC rivalry. 

Just let Bitcoin Cash be Bitcoin Cash and teach everyone why it's better than BTC. Enough people will realize BCH is the better currency and that will be all we need. "
I think the only ones having an issue with Bitcoin Cash being called Bitcoin Cash are the Bitcoin Cash fanbois who insist that Bitcoin Cash is the The Most Holy and Apostolic Coin.
"The problem is ""Bitcoin"" gained fame *because* many believed it would scale the way Bitcoin Cash is scaling on-chain. I do like the name Bitcoin Cash and agree it's not necessary to be known as just ""Bitcoin"", but people should be aware of the backstory. Currently it's ""Bitcoin"" that is symbolic for a ""be your own bank"" and separate government from money ideology. So that name gets all the enthusiasm associated with that. But Bitcoin Core isn't exactly set up for be your own bank in practice when fees prohibit moving funds for many."
"I don't even mind people calling it ""bcash"".

The only thing I want people to call it is ""cash"", ultimately. We're a long way off, but the ""true Bitcoin"" debate is a sideshow as far as I'm concerned at this stage."
"The definition of what is gold is hardcoded into our universe.
The definition of what is Bitcoin is not.

Bitcoin is merely the idea of digital money as first presented in the white paper and the first source code.

Beyond that it is up to interpretation, and “Bitcoin” will be that version which the majority of users regards as Bitcoin, based on their own individual interpretations."
">the same way bitcoin is the core source code to any of its flavors

But it isn't. If Bitcoin cash was the Debian (or any other distro) to the Linux of Bitcoin core, then Bitcoin cash would have continued to build on top of newer versions of core as they become available. But that has not happened and certainly won't in the future either.

So the analogy fails completely."
"I really don't see any point in making a huge battle about it. 

My personal opinion is that the distinction between Bitcoin BTC and Bitcoin Cash BCH is both fine __and useful__ for now. Adopters need to know that the BTC fork isn't useful as cash and that if you are wanting to use the coin as Cash then you obviously pick the token called Bitcoin Cash for your transactions.

It's clear to me that in time BCH will assert its utility over BTC, and when the hashpower moves as a result, the ""name"" if necessary will be carried across once BCH has the greatest proof of work (i.e. people will naturally start referring to Bitcoin Cash as merely Bitcoin). When the greatest proof of work chain moves across BCH there could be no reasonable contention about the use of the name.

Long-term I also think that the store of value property is stronger in BCH than BTC owing to the medium of exchange utility of BCH - so I'm finding it hard to envisage a future for BTC that is anything more than it being a bit of a curiosity.

So, all in all, I'd much prefer to use patience rather than engage in pointless and divisive battles.
"
"I use either, depending on context. As time goes on, I'm guessing it will become appropriate in more and more contexts to just refer to BCH as Bitcoin. I half wish it had just started as Bitcoin (BCH) so that it was clear that, while splitting the ledger, it's intent was to ""be"" Bitcoin, and people could get the ""You're confusing people on purpose!"" out of their system right off the bat. (I do realize that hindsight is 20/20, and that it was probably safer in some ways to call it Bitcoin Cash.)"
I call it Bitcoin Cash right up until some BCORE CUCK starts screaming the other Bword. 
Bitcoin Cash is an implementation of the Bitcoin protocol set forth in the whitepaper. Bitcoin Core is the original implementation of Bitcoin, but has since changed hands and gone a different direction than the original protocol. 
Bitcoin to Bitcoin Cash is like James to James Bond
Th curent ETH right now is a fork from ETC, right? How did they earn the ETH name? Why did ETC get to be the one with the extension in the name?
"yes, they noted that example and clarified how it actually works.

> there is no one linux implementation just called ""linux""

should do some more DD here

https://opensource.com/resources/linux

""Linux is the best-known and most-used open source operating system.""

> If you tell someone you run a Linux machine, the most common question you get (from my experience) is “which implementation/flavor?”

im not sure what your experience is but after 6 years of higher ed in IT working and 16 years in industry i can tell you from my experience, there isnt even a debate.  yes, asking which flavor is common but linux is at its core.  the same way bitcoin is the core source code to any of its flavors. 

the source code page for bitcoin cash even states ""Bitcoin Cash is a descendant of Bitcoin. ""

it doesnt change the fact that, similarly to linux, there will be better versions.  much like bitcoin cash may end up being the better version of bitcoin in the long run.  but it will never change that bitcoin is bitcoin and bitcoin cash is bitcoin cash.

i support them both, *both bitcoin and bitcoin cash are great products* but the name really isnt in question (for now, or ever)
"
"I prefer bitcoin cash tbh. 
But
I can be persuaded
Its not really important to me"
After seeing how Bitcoin (btc) people are acting, they do not deserve the name. When I want to be clear I use Bitcoin (btc) and Bitcoin (bch). Although I look forward to being able to say Bitcoin for bitcoin cash and Lightning ICO for Bitcoin(btc).
"Bitcoin Cash is perfect.  A name is important for the sake of consistency.  Nothing needs to be done about it.  Maybe someday the marketplace will congenially drop ""Cash"" but I'm not concerned about this.  Bitcoin Cash is certainly Bitcoin."
"Red Hat is Linux, Debian is Linux.

Bitcoin Core is Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin.

All are competing to be the best."
"> everything after bitcoin is a different flavor of it

This is where the analogy doesn’t seem to hold up. It isn’t accurate to say that BCH came *after* bitcoin when it’s a fork that is currently competing for the same hashpower. 

If the accumulated hashpower of BCH overtakes BTC, the BTC chain will have to hard fork and change POW to survive. Will you still call it bitcoin at that point?  And if the chain died before it could change POW, would you say that bitcoin died?"
I believe we should continue BCH to call Bitcoin Cash. If we ever get a higher market cap than BTC we might even consider changing it but for now it's better to just call it Bitcoin Cash.
Eventually, “Bitcoin Cash” could be shortened to just “Cash.”  Right now, there are multiple versions of Bitcoin, so I won’t call one of them just “Bitcoin” without distinguishing it from the others.  I would say BCH is “the better Bitcoin.”
"I personally do not care. Lots of BTC people seem to be against the sort of re-branding to ""Bitcoin CORE"". In my opinion both are ""Bitcoin"" so neither is the one and only true bitcoin. BTC supporters do not want to give up that perceived status as being the one and only true bitcoin so this is where we are at an impasse. I doubt we can reach ""community consensus"" as to naming. They want to be ""Bitcoin"" and Bitcoin cash to become BCASH to distance it from bitcoin.  I would be happy to stop referring to it as Bitcoin Core if they had another preference such as Bitcoin SL (segwit lightning) or whatever but I doubt they would accept anything other than ""Bitcoin"". The least controversial names seem to be the ticker symbols BCH and BTC which do not seem to offend anyone. That being said I will continue to refer to the over all technology as ""bitcoin"" and when needed use the tickers to differentiate. "
"Are you making an analogy between an atomic element and a software fork?

Regarding your other questions, there absolutely *can* be different offshoots of BCH and BCD should someone decide to making a competing fork. That’s how permissionless development works."
You don't have different types of gold. There's gold and other things. Can there be different types of bitcoin cash? Where does it end? There are 21,000,000 BTC. There aren't different types of Bitcoin. There won't be two types of Bitcoin Diamond.
"It's not that we mind it being called this or that, it's that when you hear epithets like ""bcash"", you are in for a bunch of inflammatory non-arguments.

Nobody likes dealing with hostile people. The same can be said with any epithet. There is nothing inherently wrong with a given word, it's just that the bile that tends to be expressed when certain words are used gets associated with the word itself."
"> yes, asking which flavor is common but linux is at its core.

People ask which flavor precisely because there *are* different implementations of the Linux kernel, ergo different *types* of Linux.  Just as there are different types of bitcoin.  To argue differently is just arguing semantics.

Edit: adding one more important distinction.

> from my experience, there isnt even a debate.

There is definitely a debate about it when it comes to bitcoin. This is the reason why saying just “bitcoin” begs the qualifier of “which type of bitcoin?”"
"nope, I'm perfectly fine with ""Bitcoin Cash"" and I like to say Bitcoin got renamed to ""Bitcoin Cash"" back in Aug-2017"
So what I hear you saying is that BTC should be called Bitcoin Segwit rather than Bitcoin Core as the only way to properly and fully understand the blockchain it uses is to run a Bitcoin client extended with the Segwit protocol.
"Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin Cash.

Bitcoin is Bitcoin.

Bitcoin Cash can become Bitcoin _only_ if the chain gets more accumulated work."
"Not sure how using bcash disassociates it.  

Accepting it would completely take away it's teeth.  If the reaction from the Bitcoin Cash community was to just start using it in a not insulting way it wouldn't be an effective insult.

Of course future public use is irrelevant to the current usage, but I think it was a fair thing to point out that it's likely to end up getting called that anyway, and all this fighting about the name is kind of pointless.

Honestly it's pointless either way.  Everyone arguing has already made up their minds and nobody else gives a crap.  This whole thing is a complete waste of time.  "
Its what users call it that counts. But users *should* call the most PoW chain Bitcoin. 
"I agree. Bitcoin Cash or BCH is fine. Bitcoin right now isn't great and making sure people know what's being talked about is valuable.

That's why I disagreed with Bitcoin.com starting to talk about Bitcoin BCH, it's too soon and may never be required. 

Bitcoin Cash *is* the real historic Bitcoin - it has the blockchain, and it has the white-paper-compliant technology. That's just factual. But one can just as well just say it's the better Bitcoin descendant and it's fine."
"Remember ""Dubstep"": What it used to be before Skrillex. And what happened After Skrillex.

Remember what ""Hoverboards"" meant before this weird segway wannabe came along: https://www.amazon.com/Hoverboard-Lithium-Free-Two-Wheel-Balancing-Certified/dp/B07BFMYRT8

Remember ""Crypto"": What it used to mean before Cryptocurrency, and what it means nowadays.

There are plenty of cases like this historically. It's irrelevant how much we want to call Bitcoin Cash ""Bitcoin"", or how much Bitcoin core people want to sue other forks who uses the name ""Bitcoin"". At the end of the day, the market decides. And the market is looking good for Bitcoin Cash, so I don't think there's any reason to focus so much too much about the name.

IMO I think it's much better to clearly use the term ""Bitcoin Cash"", it sounds cooler, in a hipster kind of way (Remember, hipsters reject conformity, that's why they like all the obscure music and stuff. And in the end, all world changing trends start from hipsters). In fact, I do feel a strong parallel between hipsters and /r/BTC (in a non-ironical way).

Nowadays I talk proudly about how Bitcoin original is for newbies and if one's interested in learning more about crypto, they should learn Bitcoin Cash with an open mind. It would be confusing if people kept using both ""Bitcoin"" and ""Bitcoin Cash"" to refer to the same thing."
Please explain how saying BTC is negative or GTFO.
Personally I think calling Bitcoin Cash just Bitcoins is poking the beast.  I think it should be called Bitcoin Cash, and then you can just call it Bitcoin after it wins.
Thank God someone with common sense 
I do not need a switch to 'Bitcoin' name. BCH is the real Bitcoin for me, and I'm still fine with Bitcoin Cash name, even forever.
"Nothing wrong with calling BCH Bitcoin Cash, especially while it still does not have most cumulative proof-of-work.  

On the other hand, I don't think there's anything hugely wrong if you want to jump the gun a little and call it Bitcoin (BCH) as long as you give a good justification for why you're doing it. To me BCH is by far more Bitcoin according to the white paper and valid Nakamoto Consensus. BTC is only ""Bitcoin"" right now if you consider *invalid* Nakamoto Consensus (since it is cheating with SegWit added, but no 2x activated).  

If BCH ever does achieve most cumulative proof-of-work, at that point I think it would be flat wrong to prevent anyone that wants to from calling it ""Bitcoin"" "
Bitcoin the idea has multiple implementations.  One is Bitcoin Core, another is Bitcoin Cash.  I think the distinction is always worth calling out.
What would /u/mmcakes think of yours? 
"First of all, it's not a ""ban"", it's a suspension, you moron. Second of all, admins said that if you continued to do so to let them know and they would go ahead and suspend you. 

I noticed you stopped and told them as much.

Anyway, your ADHD is pretty bad, huh? Why are you calling BCH stupid? Stay on topic, bro."
What losses? Not sure why you're assuming I'm in a position relative to BCH, I'm not (though I will short it at some point and let you know when I do). Again, I have to wonder what /u/capt_roger_murdock thinks of all this. Perhaps if one of your own kind tells you that you're behaving like a petulant child you'll listen. 
Sorry for your losses, BCH
So you're using the very brand of the thing you support as a pejorative? I just can't understand what you're trying to accomplish here. How is attacking people over and over with the same nonsense, while not promoting the use cases for the tech you support, helpful for the cause? You claim to be one of the original Bitcoiners from way back in 2011 and yet you spend **all your time** on reddit throwing out laughable insults? I have to imagine /u/capt_roger_murdock and other reasonable folks looks on at this type of behavior with embarrassment. From this side though it's just hilarious. This sub is just full of lunatics who can't argue a coherent point and instead just resort to the dumbest insults one can imagine.
No, I'm calling you a BCH, BCH
You're calling BCH stupid? Lol, you have no consistency.
No, you're a little BCH
Uh what? Your comments have devolved beyond a point of incomprehension. Once again, I don't hold BCH or have a position open with respect to BCH derivatives. I sold all mine with an average cost of around .15 and haven't looked back since. Your arguments are embarrassing because they revolve around some sort of fantasy that I'm underwater on a short, which I am most assuredly am not. Again, I'd be happy to let you know if/when I *do* short the shit but until then it's just delusional on your behalf to think that I'm in an open position. 
Where that ban I was supposed to get. Oh, you were lying again? 
"So it's 5x less than the real Bitcoin? Lol. Like I said, let me know when the ratio is 1 or higher. Until then, you look like a joke calling it the ""real Bitcoin"". 

Also, your excuse for being on reddit *all the time* is rather sad. I'm sorry you don't have a life, bro. You clearly weren't around in 2011 or else you wouldn't be spending every waking moment crying on reddit about how low the ratio is and how unfair everyone is being towards BCash. You'd be out and about, living a meaningful life. But you're not. You're body is just wasting away as you kick and scream on reddit *all the time*, which is just so incredibly sad."
You're a stupid BCH
*Yawn*, is that all you can ever think to say? Where's the originality? You sound like a pre-teen.
You should cover now, bch. Your face is getting ripped off.
No, I'd rather protect the real bitcoin, BCH, from trolls like you. Btw, cross at 0.173 and climbing. Ahahaha. 
"What are you talking about? I'm responding to your comments in response to mine. How is that harassment? 

Anyhow, you seemingly don't have an answer and you clearly don't understand what *hypocrite* means.

I ask again though. If you're such an early adopter, you *must* be super loaded. Why not find something better to do with your time besides troll and fight with people on reddit? Is it because you're lying about being an early adopter as your reddit account indicates? Seems highly likely."
"Ahahaha. What a hypocrite. 

Btw, why are you harassing me?"
What? I thought you liked BCH? Now you're calling it stupid?
"A 12tb hard drive can be had for $400 and has enough space to do **full** 32MB blocks for 7 years. Cable internet is more than enough to support this amount of data. 4.5GB/day, about 137GB/mo.
