"Curious to know what you think now...after news the CFTC sent subpoenas to Bitfinex and Tether... Still think it's all just ""conspiracy theories""?  You were very articulate in your presentation of plausible answers to the questions circulating about the ""shady"" wallet activity, so any insight you could share on today's news would be super appreciated!"
"Yah my main goal with that was to point out that there were ways to explain how Tether worked other than OMG Conspiracy / Fractional Reserve etc... I'm not affiliated with Tether or a sycophant of Bitfinex in any way.

The audit news is troubling though it was known about for a while before just today. It's true that Tether supply did blow up towards the end of the year but that also corresponded with many more large exchanges accepting Tether. If you look at the Tether rich list now its littered with exchanges that were not there even 3 months ago. 

I have to say that the audit getting canceled really does not look good and combined with the CFTC subpoena things definitely don't look good so we will see how that plays out. The thing that lingers in the back of my mind is that the owner of Bitfinex are making soooooo much money running that exchange I don't see why they would risk blowing it all up by going fractional reserve with Tether, really for no reason. 

One very interesting development that just happened within the hour is that Bitfinex sent 200M Tether BACK to the Treasury wallet as you can see here http://omniexplorer.info/lookupadd.aspx?address=1NTMakcgVwQpMdGxRQnFKyb3G1FAJysSfz . This is the first time this really has ever happened. Its effectively a ""reduction in supply"", but it wont actually become official until that Tether gets burned. Regardless I see this as them sending a signal that Tether can actually work the way it was intended to work i.e. people can cash out. We will see how this plays out"

What do you mean by this exactly? Do other exchanges not adjust the spread?
What does “on the float” mean exactly?
People who wanted to buy low
Transaction fees need to stay low. Bitcoin was once actually useful for small, international money transfers with low, low fees. Not so much anymore.
That was OUR job.

"As I dive deeper, on their website homepage they make it appear as though it is a 1:1 (aka 100%) reserve. But when this all started happening, people were showing the fine print (presumably from signing up) that Tether makes no promises that Dollars can actually be withdrawn.

Edit: I went looking for this - didn't spend time, but it wasn't easy to find."
How is it being a bot?
">""Every tether is always backed 1-to-1, by traditional currency held in our reserves. So 1 USD₮ is always equivalent to 1 USD.""

I always wonder about that ""1-to-1"". They want me to think it's one tether to one dollar. But it doesn't say that.

What if it's one tether to one zloty. Or one tether to one cent? those are traditional currencies."
Ooohhh that is so dangerous....

Excellent points. Well said.
how could Tether not be backed AND not be a hoax?
The idiot masses are where the money comes from.  How do you think the price has risen?  The same few people trade back and forth at ever increasing prices?
"Don't ask me. Look at my post history. I have been warning people for 6 months that maybe the price of all crypto is getting a bit pumped ... 

Now the pumping also created a REAL crypto mania. That one is not fake. But can this mania survive? Or will we have 5 years of low interest in crypto
? I hope so actually. Sick of this investment day trading bullshit system. I want a stable currency. A good working payment system with benetifs for everybody and way better then paypal. 

One click micropayments on the internet with good security and a money that is digital native so programs can handle it without human supervisors.

If the market crashes 80% do you really think people will still have interest in crypto? It's not like it used to be. There's media attention now. The name will be stained for years to come and no one will trust it.
news is news... if you want a protected wonderland r/bitcoin might be better suited 
And it was today brought to the attention of the media. It's still news even if it didn't just happen if it's new infornation

"> why are people fleeing INTO tether right now?

People fleeing from obscure exchanges and landing on larger exchanges, with Tethers. Prediction: BTC and ETH will go through a massive pump. as people try to convert everyhting to a ""solid"" crypto.

Will soon be followed by adump, when people try to cash out, in fiat exchanges.

Will be beautifil to watch. Will be hard to participate in though, everything will be jammed up. The unwinding will last for days."
What if Tether is not backed, but it is also not discovered to be a hoax? What then? Everyone still uses it as a peg to the dollar?
Tether is not backed by anything . Get real. Do you think the FBI needed approval from Serbia to arrest the guy from btc-e at a Cyprus airport? 
"If Tether does actually hold those reserves, nothing happens other than a short blip. If Tether doesn’t the USDT and Bitfinex are dead of course. 

The interesting question is if Bitfinex has been manipulating Bitcoin prices. If they have, the market could react in all kinds of crazy ass ways. "
"> Are they under US jurisdiction

They are so many shell-companies deep removed that actually serving them papers might take decades."
Doesn't this line up to around the time that Bitfinex employee Chris Ellis removed the warrant canaries from his twitter profile? Looks like it was significant after all.
"This will LOOK bad for all crypto when they start crashing. And this will BE bad for all crypto investors. For me as a user of Bitcoin Cash and not an investor this is very good. I want 10 years of boring Bitcoin Cash with no trolls and no shills and nothing happen but slowly getting more user adoption. I want a new world wide currency. A money of the internet. A money by the people for the people. Give me 10 years, starting with Bitcoin Cash being 1000 USD / BCH and then a 10% increase in price every year. That would be awesome for me. It would make Bitcoin Cash a way better currency. People would want to buy and sell more with more price stability. 

Long term price stability for any crypto that WANTS to be money .... is very good. So yeah a -80% market crash that flushes and purges the system? I think mid term (1 - 3 years) that would be very good for Bitcoin Cash. 

And understand this. Banks are okay with crypto being a volatile investment. It's the currency and money by the people for the people aspect that would make them obsolete.  "
Who cares... US customers Don't use bitfinex... Stop creating FUD!!!
Firmly confirmed!
Should we avoid trading on Bitfinex? And get anything we have on there off?

Fuck yeah!!!
Chronicle of an announced death... we all know tether is a little shady.
"Assuming the warrant was issued early December - can someone explain to me the logic of Tether printing further USDT early Jan to prop up BTC prices as has been accused?

If USDT is not backed by anything then why would they knowingly commit further fraud whilst under a government subpoena? 

Desperation doesn’t quite make this add up. 

Ps: phew the Tether bubble popped a lot earlier then we all expected. "
good news that this is happening now. better to get all of these scam projects out of the way during this bear market so there will be less obstacles to overcome during the next bull run. BULLISH
You're an idiot.
If any of their business crosses the US border, things get interesting. This may include internet traffic routed through the US.
Prediction: US will ban Tethers from US-based exchanges. It will hurt. A lot.
They can't say they couldn't see this coming.
Wait for it... Dodocoin!
TIL.
"No, you cannot. Check it out on Bitfinex'ed (Twitter).

Only a few select acounts can do ""hawala banking"""
Well, it's my understanding that in the fine print the explicitly state that Tether cannot be redeemed for US Dollars. So... how is it either?
"I don't think that is what Tether is saying. In fact, I believe that the fine print specifically states that it is not backed by a Dollar. That is what makes it so interesting that it remains flat, even today:

The crazy thing is that (in my opinion), long-term, crypto is way under-priced. So the attention drawn by this pumping may actually be a good thing. Though quite likely to have a painful correction.
"If Bitcoin Cash is not a better payment system then paypall, not more userfriendly to use. Not cheaper. Not more fair. Does not give more individual power and freedom. If it does not have all these properties then no, nobody should be interested in it.  But I believe it's a better form of money then we have. But people don't know this. We have to tell and show them. 

>The name will be stained for years to come and no one will trust it.

Just tell them that the Bitcoin Stock failed but the payment system behind the stock is still working fine. "

Lol i don't but what pisses me off is that people talking crap about Tether and bitfinex don't even use bitfinex. And tether is a blessing for day traders,  yesterday i day traded for hours,made some BTC but didn't make any USD because guess what? BTC dropped. So people should stop hating on Tether. It not meant to be held for a period of time or anything. Get in, get out. 
It's a good thing that news like this never leaks.  Over two months.  Especially when people can make major profit from the info.
I don't think so. Entire market is down. Gold, Crypto, Stocks. Only thing green is bonds.
This is going to be VERY tough on legit USD exchanges. BFX/Tether may be the one perpetrating the fraud, but they get to avoid the massive run for USD out of Coinbase/GDAX and Gemini. Thank god they're both FDIC insured.
It was my understanding that trading on an exchange doesn't actually result in on-chain transactions, and thereby not affected by fees.
"If Tether is unbacked then it's pretty much literally a USD counterfeiting operation. You just can't say ""oh this pretend widget is worth $1 because we say so,"" only the US Federal Reserve is allowed to do that ;)"
Yes. That's why they didn't nab him in Russia.
It could even be recycled FUD to get the prices to drop and shake more people off. I mean it’s dropping so it’s working.

Meaning that Coinbase is in generally such a bad place to do business there's no reason to celebrate added trading options while they have systemic failures in customer service.

Litecoin still costs more in fees, I'd rather stick to BCH personally for now.  Or ethereum for more advanced contracts.
And ltc is better than bch because?
How do you figure? Please explain in detail how high you think Litecoin fees are. 
I've often spent around 10 cents for litecoin or more (sometimes less).. and 1 cent (or under 1 cent) for BCH.  It depends on inputs/outputs and current price of course, but I use both, ideally the cheapest at any given time.  BCH is always cheaper for me as far as I've been able to tell, 0-1 sat/byte is hard to beat (even on a good sized transaction, that's less than half a cent right now.)  On ETH I'm around 2 cents (still beating litecoin) at a gas price of 2 gwei.  I haven't tried 1 gwei lately but it should still work in theory.
did you read the bitcoin whitepaper? Did you want to get in on that? Well the whitepaper talks about bch and not current btc

I have believed into Bitcoin Cash since the time first time it got some news coverage on all the crypto news sites. That's how I found out about it. Was also looking out for something that could finally provide an answer to the segwit issue. 
Oh my goodness I sure hope they asked /r/Bitcoin for permission to do so, otherwise they'll start making brigade posts again (which they do so often I'm surprised the admins haven't had to step in)
GDAX had this for quite some time already, right? Didn't know Coinbase wasn't up to date.
https://www.coinex.com/
BCH has now replaced LTC.
"I think it is separated; I am form europe and obviously I've always deposited/withdrawn in EUR, however coinbase/gdax does not allow me to trade for USD. So I don't think you have the possibility of withdrawing EUR if your coinbase account uses USD."
Finally! That's some great news. 
I like BCH, but Coinbase seems not so helpful.
BCH is a shitcoin.
yesss Finally !! but nothing happened,  BCH is crashing even harder than before :/ I cant even unload my Bitcoin-cash bags.  
Man its too bad that bch is crashing harder than btc :/

Have they enabled timely deposits or withdrawals, or disabled randomly cancelling transactions yet?

"I got the free CET from coinex when I logged in!! About 5047, I guess  the giveaway is at random.

The first round of giveaway is over. I consulted with the customer service, it's estimated that there'll be more round in the future. That's what I read on their website https://www.coinex.com/token, it says members can trade CET with BTC, BCH, USDT, etc. And CET can be deducted directly as trading fees.
That's amazing!! I couldn't help but share with y'all."
With such a huge platform as Coinbase it always takes time to get things to change on there. 
Amen! It will one day be the defacto bitcoin.
