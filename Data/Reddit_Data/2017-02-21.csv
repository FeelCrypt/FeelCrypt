"u/PeteDaKat you haven't even entered the rabbit hole. - most of the early bitcoin adopters are banned form posting in r/bitcoin It'is a heavily censored forum. 

to get a feel for how bad it is I suggest reading the OP link and these comments - note the title. 

to get a balanced view I'd suggest reading r/btc and r/bitcoin not just one or the other. "
