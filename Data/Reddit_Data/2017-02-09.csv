/r/btc may have more noise, but we don't try to control what you think. Congrats Ryan for being a free thinker! 
atlernative facts
But all controversial matters are deleted from /r/bitcoin so there's no low-quality discussion!
"For sure and they agitate the people who get banned which totally distracts from the issues being debated - like censorship is debatable - 

With: ""how can you say there is no censorship here, see this - that's censorship. Oh and see this down vote that's censorship. Bla bla bla"""
The CEO of reddit was caught manipulating reddit content himself. Why anyone would think other moderators of smaller subreddits wouldn't is beyond me.

Samson Mow is the king of ad hominem, did you ever look at his twitter.  The post could be deleted and not given a ban.  But they selectively ban anyone in opposition.

Why are facts that don't jive with /r/btc narrative getting downvoted?  Hmmm....
May I ask why you downvoted my request for clarification (which was written before you added in the second half of your comment here with a ninja-edit)?
How weak and ineffectual.
Reddit is like that. There are gems each day if you look around.
Well done for keeping up the tradition.
Yes it's really too bad, but at the same time there are lots of facts about some people that I would have never seen otherwise
That's pretty normal in revolution times. The Gandhi- and Mandela movements also focused mainly on the terror of the state terrorists until they've been blown where they belong to. 
"One thing that might help is a stricter mod policy.

Strict on politeness, but especially strict on all kinds of *double content*:

* No quotes from stuff already posted
* No links to comments
* No links to post in other subreddits

These can all be considered double and would hopefully leave more room for actual bitcoin discussion."
Certainly, but that content is usually pretty obvious and avoidable by the thread titles. I think you just wanted to appear fair by saying the quality is lower. The maximum quality is higher here, even though there is bad stuff mixed in (and I'm really not sure there is any less bad stuff and ad hominem there than here when they actually do allow discussion on controversial matters - apples to apples - they can be exceedingly insulting and petty despite being an echo chamber, whereas plenty of people here are even-keeled and civil despite plenty of hot debating). 
Agree with every word of that tweet. Keep up the fine work sir. Still pissed reddit didn't make a (blockchain) coin. Thought that was a great idea. 
Are low-quality discussions any less prevalent on the other sub when they are discussing controversial matters? From what I've seen, no. They are often in fact far worse. It's just that controversial matters are discussed way more here, as there are no policemen standing by to intervene.
"I think a significant portion of those users are just here to stir the pot, knowing their posts won't get deleted, so they can later claim there is a lot of low quality content on here.

If they do take it too far, or violate a reddit rule and get banned they then cry censorship."

"I know...

somewhere on reddit , replying to a random comment ....

are you serious?!?!


this is what he did many years ago , when he was Adam Back , to make a statement: http://www.cypherspace.org/adam/uk-shirt.html

now that he's adam back he does what you quoted . 

do you see the difference ?"
"I think reddit should at least notify when are getting deleted/censored..

Or make it more difficult to ""manipulate people opinion"""
What do you mean?
[RES makes this much easier.](https://redditenhancementsuite.com/)
I think it would be interesting to measure the amount of energy you used to post this meaningless comment which could have been used to do something more productive.
You are free to go...
"I get your point, but I see it as a result of the circumstances we are in rather than a disingenuity. Bitcoin Unlimited is almost certainly not an ideal upgrade, but a solution weaved within the atmosphere of unexpected social manipulation. Those who (rightly) view it within that context and those who don't will have problems communicating.

But yeah, I can't deny that I get frustrated when the occasional persons who are both anti-censorship *and* anti-BU get singled out and decimated from all sides. Those are the debates we should be having, and those that don't get drowned are usually interesting.

"> ideology over pragmatism

You might also call it enlightened self-interest. There was a time when this was assumed normal, and part of being a decent person.

Regardless, expecting censorship supporters to cheer for censorship is quite naive. A good example is luke-jr, who signs texts condemning censorship while at the same time claiming it doesn't exist in the notorious forum.

Most modern autocrats talk extensively about how much they love freedom of speech, free-press and so on. This always happens in parallel to their education of public about public good (fear mongering if you prefer), however. For those who are unfortunate enough to be living in one of those places where censorship is prevalent, drawing parallels is almost inevitable.

The only thing I can call ""evidence"" is the fact that Adam only produced supporting rhetoric for censorship (vote manipulation complaints, etc.) and did not speak out against it during the only time it mattered. He began saying that he is against censorship in principle (who isn't?) until it became obvious that censorship would not magically remove contention. He often equates the moderation policies of forums and subreddits, which is as insincere as it gets.
"
"He do not take a stand against censorship/perceived censorship. He  asked theymos, maybe, but even after getting told no, he still continues to post on a forum he himself think is censored. 

He is willingly cooperating with the dictator just like reddit. 

If reddit really supported bitcoin, they would remove all mods from the sub and put proffesional mods instead who are disinterested in either side of the argument. 

We dont ask him to start a mailing list or whatever but to stop cooperating until all ideas can be freely discussed. "

It was insane. Core trolls were everywhere trying to make the fork go as badly as possible.
Would you say the same of Ryan X Charles' denouncement of censorship (in the tweet)?
u/Rxef3RxeX92QCNZ it is time for you to recharge, go plug yourself in.
"But Adam didn't ""merely note in some random comments that he is opposed"", he personally contacted theymos to complain and try to get him to change his policy, which theymos ignored/declined. 

Do you see what I mean?"
"Oh, that's a bummer.

I'm guessing that's why shills have had a field day on subreddits like r/ethereum and others during the last couple of years. I remember how unreadable that subreddit was during the dao hack and hardfork."

"Ryan X. Charles is the moderator of his Twitter account.  Freedom of speech doesn't mean you have the right to be part of everyone's conversations.  If you disagree with something he says, you're free to tweet whatever you like.  He is under no obligation to listen to you.

/r/bitcoin is also moderated.  Freedom of speech doesn't mean you have the right to be part of everyone's conversations.  If you disagree with something said, you're free to comment elsewhere. They're under no obligation to listen to you.

Discuss."
"No. Ryan took a stand. Adam said ""hmm, yes, I agree that censorship is bad"" *goes back to posting on /r/bitcoin*"
We mean that if Roger started censoring mentions of Core we would raise absolute hell all over the sub and elsewhere until he stopped, whereas a few Core/BS folks merely note in some random comments that they are opposed. I don't understand that mindset at all.

">  let's you see exact amount of both

Pretty sure this was removed from Reddit (api?), so you can no longer see the amount of up and down votes anymore."
Don't flatter yourself.  BTC pepe memes would be dank, though.
Well to be honest I would have banned you too. Ad hominem attack are fucking useless in the discussion. 
Censorship *is* low quality. It's just a different kind of low quality.
"There's a lot less talk of bitcoin in general. This is the sub where you go to talk about stuff you can't talk about on /r/bitcoin so it makes sense.

If I have something not blocksize related I'd post it there first personally because I'm going to get a much higher response rate."
[deleted]
"I think there is a vocal minority in this sub whom are here just to stir the pot. This can lead to some extremely redundant and non-productive conversations, which to me, is fairly low quality. It doesn't always happen, but it is frequent enough.

Edit: so to some"
"see u/adam3us , that's how you speak against censorship .

"Free thinkers, conspiracy theorists, folks that are allergic to facts all feel right at home in rbtc.  

Where no idea is rejected on science,. because science is just a few guys opinions.   What do they know?  amirite?

I should post your favorite ""resident moron"" Olivier's Whalepool interview where he makes nearly this exact arguments and gets laughed at for being an idiot.   "
Reddit is horrible in general, and there are really bad tradeoffs with both approaches in comparing r/btc and r/bitcoin.
I love this
"This is what I dislike about reddit. You can't tell what is happening with the downvotes/upvotes, reddit enhancement suite let's you see exact amount of both but you still don't know who or why most of the time.

Its different on Steemit where everything is stored on the blockchain, makes downvoting for censorship obsolete since everything is tracked."
"He is right. We need a good quality bitcoin subreddit (not r/bitcoin, not r/btc) focused on development and a good quality bitcoin starting point (not bitcoin.com, not bitcoin.org) focused on getting new users onboard.

"
the left love to talk about free speech and then censor any one who disagrees with them, or they threaten and attempt to kill if they can
False dichotomy, you should source news from many sources, but he is correct about the low quality on r/btc.
K I'm subbing now. Don't disappoint, I expect the lowest quality memes u got. 
Hehe, I think this is one of those things where you came out of the closet, but we all knew :). Cheers!
"I just got banned from /r/bitcoin for ""being racist"" because I said Samson Mow probably smells like noodles, LOL"

"Spot on about the low quality! :)

"
"A lot of people just getting into bitcoin like to read both sides and immediately post a hot take about how evil Core is and that they're ruining Bitcoin and society in general.

I definitely prefer btc over bitcoin but the wannabe revolutionaries do get old. 

Civil discussion on both sides is rare. A shame since the technology is plain cool."
[deleted]
I would guess majority of /r/bitcoin users don't really care about the blocksize or because they aren't aware of it. One side discussion is always easier to read.
"What makes r/btc low quality?

I like the open discussion and the relative lack of to-the-moon circle-jerks and memes, but maybe he's referring to something else."
"Guys, the highest grade gold mine only produce 44 gram/tonne of real gold. That's 0.0044%.

all of reddit is one giant steaming pile of censorship. It's a goddamn insult to the memory of Aaron Schwartz. I fucking hate you /u/spez
"Yay!!  We're a low quality sub!!  /s

Sounds like the Bitcoin version of negging."
"The other day when it was pointed out that your post was censored from /r/bitcoin, I thought it was a wake up call for a concerned bitcoin user. You appear to be just another troll.

Blocking someone on Twitter is not the same as the systematic purging of anyone holding a certain point of view."
/r/BitcoinNeutralZone, though I don't have time to curate it yet. 
Good luck getting one started without the name Bitcoin
A curated but neutral bitcoin sub would be nice. Comments can go wherever they like but it the actual posts were kept positive, that would have its place.

"Just yesterday, he posted these comments:


>[I would prefer it if there was no topic moderation, and said this to theymos, firstly because supporting free and open discourse is the right thing to do; and secondly because Streisand effect - even if he considers he is doing a privatised form of public safety warnings in deleting inadvisable promotions - it will obviously still backfire. And for the people knowingly arguing in favour of bad ideas, whether based on normal tradeoff comparisons, or using Streisand as a prop ""must be good because others thought it inadvisable"" to promote in advisable actions, it's all bad - regardless a bad idea is a bad idea. Censorship is bad. Moderation I dislike. Tripping the Streisand effect is obvious and counter-productive. And arguing for people to do inadvisable things is also bad. Lying and spreading misinformation in lieu of technical comparisons is also bad. Seems like there's a lot of bad here. Are you contributing to bad? Or are you a force for good - I think that is the question you need to ask yourself if you want to feel good about your place in the world. I feel very good. Do you? Having a good faith and honest discourse on security tradeoffs, I think you will find, despite false claims of Streisand applying there too - that moderators here do not moderate. But in any case it would be better if there was another forum with less noise, and more good faith, where useful discourse could occur without false flags, Streisand baiting etc. Be part solution: contribute signal, and lead by example: speak in good faith only.](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5sq5fv/contentious_forks_vs_incremental_progress/ddhah8o/)


Later, he also said:

>[What do you want me to do about it - go start a new mailing list, I was thinking I could do that. Complain to theymos: check, done,he declined to stop censoring topics. Complain to Roger, check, done (he declined to unblacklist a bunch of people from r/btc). BU forum is heavily censored, you cant even comment on their stuff usefully without official membership in some club of inexperienced bossy people. Roger has his own forum, a bit advertisement heavy for my tastes to be considered a community forum.
How about you solve the problem. If you make a forum with no moderation and no censorship i'll join.](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5sq5fv/contentious_forks_vs_incremental_progress/ddhake9/)"
"u/adam3us did not need to do much just express his principles in public and stick to them.


2 years ago he could also have said as a matter of principal he's going to boycott forums that enforce censorship.

It would also be in line with cyphopunk principles if he pointed out that IRC and Bitcoin mailing lists are dysfunctional when they enforce rules that prohibit the discussion of hard fork by declaring them off topic - the net results of which is censoring all discussion on how to make them safe or more acceptable. 

He could have publicly ask his employees to do the same.

Instead he leverage it and Blockstream developed segwit in an echo chamber devoid of criticism."
Both subs are low quality and I rarely browse them unless they hit the front of r/all. I am a huge bitcoin enthusiast, too.
Everything is one comment away from AXA/blockstream/core conspiracy theories. Every discussion devolves into the same bullshit time and time again. A post completely not related to anything regarding blocksize will have a comment about core ruining bitcoin within 5 minutes. 
More like the insults and conspiracy theories I think
"I just read the three of them together....:-) 
https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin+Buttcoin+btc/
and I can compare the engagement in parallel"
One thing that would make this sub better...if a third of the posts weren't about how much people gate the other sub.
