That's just the thing! Why damage it when you have better alternative solutions. 
That is the troll limiting feature built into all of Reddit.
Funny how this comment made it 
That's a secondary exchange.  The USD goes into Kraken and out to your counterparty.  USD is not sent to Tether for depositing.  
"people aren't buying USDT with USD, traders are using it as a stable ""safe haven"" in-between trades in and out of a coin, for example."
The market cap of USDT is 340mil. Even if USDT turns out to be a complete scam. Deduct 340mil from BTC market cap of 66billion. The worst that can happen is BTC losing 5% which is part of everyday fluctuation. 
A 400 million dollar reserve coin couldn't cause a 50 billion dollar price rise, could it?
Yes.
Where does Kraken get the Tether?
Oh no, Hillary deleted all my comments!
