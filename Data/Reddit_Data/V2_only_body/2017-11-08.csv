This will buy years for the legacy banking and payments industry if BCH can't rise up."
"It wasn't a attack lmao.


The entire benefit having anything digital is that you can update it in two clicks lmao.

Yet the core fangays were so triggered because they are so scared of change."
Has any of such threats being made public? 
You mean like 30 minutes later. When you wrote this, there was no turmoil.
The market cap just increased by 10 billion through a 20 million dollar buy? I don't think so.
"Well, that is how YOU see it.

Many others see it exactly the opposite way: that this was a small, corporate funded minority trying to exercise social control over the most valuable cryptocurrency. And guess what... they couldn't!"
"EDA is about to get fixed, and let's not forget there is still only one usable Bitcoin - namely BCH. SegwitCoin 1 will keep bogging down harder and harder, fees will keep going up, transfers will keep getting slower... they'll have to fork eventually, but until then BCH is the only Bitcoin anyone can get out of an ATM or use for purchases.

However watching my wallet dive now temporarily is less fun than one might think. Edit: ok, 12 hours later, equilibrium restored. Now to sit back and enjoy watching BCH appreciate."
"> Or everybody loses

Well, that is always a way to see things too. However, I don't think this is in any way a LOSE-LOSE situation, but I agree only time will tell..."
"Time for more ""store of value"" fallback speak. Who cares for hilarious fees if anyone just holds? Wait, pyramid anyone?"
Everybody wins because (a) CME trading by Wall Street will not be subverted by an incomprehensible fork and (b) there is now a clear choice between 2 well financed Bitcoin forks
Yeah, but that's only in retrospect. When he originally posted, it was just up up and up which we know now didn't sustain, but he couldn't have known then.
">Or everybody loses because we now have inflated the coin issuance and have an insecure, low difficulty Bitcoin cash chain...

Inflated insuance? If you talk about BCH supply has increased by less than a tenth of a percent (do the calculation yourself) and DAA get fixed next week.


"
If the smarter than average crowd on the Bitcoin scene could be so well manipulated, how many times haven't we all being manipulated on different contexts?
Transparency is a pillar for democracy. 
"> Then it is easy for you to know in which one you should invest.

Yeah?
I have the choice between a usable chain that isn't usable due to a missing economic network and that is very insecure (low difficulty) aka Bitcoin cash and a unusable chain that is controlled by economical illiterates aka Bitcoin legacy.

Great!"
Good news, bad delivery
Monero.
"> It's not decentralized

Wrong. Fundamentals are solid, just a lot of smoke above"
Yeah, that was trolling. It doesn't have anything to do with his opponent being the most corrupt US politician since Nixon.

use USD, it has almost 0 fees. that's what you're concerned about, right? certainly not sovereign money, cause otherwise you wouldn't follow the random whims of some miner cabal
">Huh? The economic majority are people with coins, and bitcoin businesses like BitPay, BitGo, Coinbase, etc. They clearly lost. 

The best evidence was the futures markets which indicated the economic majority preferred the original chain

> The rest of us lost. There are more of us than there are of you.

Clearly this isn't the case because we can see the levels of support in bcash and after aug 1 st almost every ""big blocker"" moved to support bcash leaving almost no users supporting segwit2x except a few ceos in 15% of btc companines
"
"> Its saddens me deeply that you actually believe those three points

He spend about 80% of every day on reddit posting about bitcoin and how great segwit is. Not sure if he really does believe it or if he does this out of some economic incentive."
"Oh, wow, I didn't even notice. Thank you for pointing it out. =)

So I guess this was my gift? ***The establishment of Bitcoin Cash as a serious contender for a major peer-to-peer currency alternative.***"
"Yeah, that's why it was pumped and subsequently dumped in the course of two hours. Trader were like, great, now it'll be stable. Then they realized the fees are going to remain high, and sold the shit out of it.

Clarification edit: Because BTC is not (it's a commodity)"
"> Trolling against BCH will be off the charts in the coming months..

I don't think so.

BTC users don't really feel threatened by BCH for several reasons:

- Many hold both (after all there was an airdrop)
- BCH implemented full replay protection, so it doesn't disrupt the blockchain
- It's currently far in market cap.

So, I would think for the time being every crypto community will get back to its own matters instead of focussing on the neighbors matters... which is a GREAT thing."
and Voorhees confirmed as well https://twitter.com/ErikVoorhees/status/928316364585963520
I'd go buy a couple right now if Coinbase supported it. Too lazy to setup accounts on other exchanges (photo ids, confirmation times, etc.) but for me it is obvious that the price will increase. Not explosively but maybe slowly like 50% over a year.
It is, fomo selloff in bch to buy bcore until ppl wakeup and then a huge boom up in bch
I think it is very bullish for BCH but the market might go crazy for a little while after such news.

"poloniex, BCH dropping like a stone

https://imgur.com/a/uAbSf"
aren't the futures deals canceled if the fork does not happen?
Market isn't rational.
"Fair enough, I agree with you completely. I don't think bitcoin is the long term solution anyways (50-100+ years). Once we figure out that the processing our governments do can be distributed, we can then figure out that the the value of that processing belongs to the people, and we can start to give it to ourselves.  

This is all just still the beginning. The biggest threat has always been that adoption would happen too quickly for the research and development to keep up with. Organizing the block space is complex."
If that were the case this wouldn't have happened. Hash power enforces the rules, the rules are defined by the community at-large. This was an attempt to test the theory as to whether or not hash power can force a hard fork. It can't, as evidenced by the fact that (despite trying a number of times) it hasn't.
 15 people being unwilling to compromise just overruled 80% of the hash rate and deeply divided the community. Who wants to be involved in something so controlled by a bunch of zealots?
"No. $3-$5 is a great price for using bitcoin for what it's actually good at being used for today.

Go buy a pizza or video game or whatever with bitcoin cash, where miner fees are nearly $0. Tell me how practical of an experience it is for you. 

What this sub can't accept is that, even though every bitcoiner in the world would love to eventually be able to do all of their financial transactions with bitcoin, the reality is that we are a long way off from that today.

The price just jumped up 5% and down 10% in the span of 2 hours today. You think there were people in japan buying their coffee with bitcoin during that? No. It's not ready. It's too volatile, the infrastructure isn't there. 

We have a LOT of time before on-chain scaling is the bottleneck of retail adoption. "
"Because the activation of Segwit was tied to the arbitrary measure of miner support as a proxy for consensus. That was clearly a mistake, and everyone has learned from it. And that's why the UASF happened.

Miners literally have one job: to enforce the rules of the network in exchange for bitcoins. If they enforce different rules, then they get different coins. If the users don't want these different coins, then they are worthless, and the miners wasted their electricity for something that has no value. So no, they most certainly do not make the rules."
They both are bank coins. The problem with Etherium is the money isn't locked up for a few months like it will be with LN hubs. Perhaps they will add that 'feature' in the future.
">    Trezor is already forcing its users onto Segwit addresses

>False. You can create a non-segwit address anytime you want. I use both segwit and non segwit on my Trezor regularly.

My understanding is they are referring to non-segwit addresses as legacy transactions and starting to push people onto segwit addresses. Force is not accurate, but I suspect that will change.


>    Now that we have segwit addresses all it will take is to identify a terrorist or some other bad guy with money that needs to be seized.

>100% false. There is no way to seize a segwit address. if you believe that's true, then take some. Go pick any segwit address out there and seize it.

>The fact that you actually believe this proves how well Roger's lies have worked on ignorant users. It's a real shame.

I never suggested anyone could steal it. Miners are the ones who mine transactions and they are the ones who get to decide which transaction is accepted and which ones are not. You knew this though. You understood what I meant and choose to misinterpret it. 

If your mind is closed then go debate someone else. I do not have time for fools. "
"Miners are not dictating anything, they are servants to the blockchain.

The bitcoin community dictates how things move and in what direction

Miners need profit to operate, they will mine whatever makes them profit.

Read up on bitcoin, it will eventually come to you"
I think you're right. The main target for the propaganda machine was 2x, which they have now killed. Next they will set their sights on Bitcoin (Cash)
It is. jessquit is looking at the wrong chart..
Long-term, yes. This is an opportunity to buy more BCH.
"Honestly, I didn't see it coming.
Still processing, but my current line of thinking is:

*""I went into BCH due to fundamentals. Fundamentals hasn't changed. I'm fine.""*"
I didn't. I'll admit it.
I'll admit I trusted Garzick to keep his word. Didn't know he'd fuck it up like this.
Down $30 in the last hour and this news has hardly spread yet. OTOH, longterm, 1X has crippling issues.
"> Maybe it's fine to have two bitcoins

It's unstable. One event or the other will shift the balance"
You can always fork the code and start your own coin? What is stopping you?
"Depends.  A lot of people were parking in Cash to sit out the 1X / 2X fracas in case that went sideways and Cash became a more viable chain to mine.

Now that it appears that there will be no 1X / 2X fracas it's back to ""follow the herd.""

New money will shift to BCH.

When your first buying experience is with Bitcoin Cash, it is what you will know as crypto.  In time, as values rise, you will have hodlers."
"It means the congestion in BTC will remain, making BCH stand out on fundamentals. It also means the B1X proponents gets to call it a ""win"" and that core will remain in power.

Short term, this isn't bullish.
Long term, it might bet.

"My node was is a fast dedicated machine. Node counts don't mean anything as anyone can run multiple nodes.

Major proponents are switching to Bitcoin Cash from time to time and pretty silent about it. At some point they'll switch and stay
I am in the exact same position.  I want info, here you get drama for the most part.
Uh-huh. Great discussion.
How so? Looks like you were right. Hash power stays on BTC (for now) and price of BCH goes up.

"How many times do we need to refute these same old tired banker's lies?

* SegWit does not support 2-4 times more transactions than pre-SegWit.  The best expert predictions are that with 100% of transactions being SegWit, it might increase throughput by a factor of 1.7.  Only paid banker shills and brainwashed idiots are still maintaining that SegWit is a 2-4 times increase.  Not sure which you are, but you definitely do not belong in a sub for thinking people.

* Bitcoin is been running with full blocks for about a year.  However, it's a self-limiting situation, as the fees are driving vendors and real users away in droves."
See, I told you...  bitcoin is now lower than it was at the fork cancellation announcement. It turned quick after that initial blow up higher.
Tell me about it...
They're politically correct. They should mention Bitcoin Cash to clear things up
"I won't be. Miners are bound by game theory. If Bitcoin Cash is more profitable to mine and Jihan for any reason will mine 1x only, he will lose competition and will go out of business. Miners agree with me and at least 2/3 are ready to switch to Bitcoin ABC at any moment. If they ditch btc1 for any other software, they'll do it for a reason

U see, Jihan doesn't matter in grand scheme of things. Nakamoto consensus and game theory does"
"It's just a guess of course, but since the uncertainty of the fork is gone Bitcoin Cash is not as a strong contender to overthrow Bitcoin and thus the opportunity to make a quick buck is as well.

Bitcoin Cash is however stronger than before all of this and that's why I don't think it will fall down to the previous price of low to mid $300."
">Most s2xers support Bitcoin Cash now.

Why Bitcoin is valuable? Many things are scarce, not as many things are useful
Will you say the same thing when the bubble will pop like it always did? 
Isn't the signaling very clear?
"No, the miners would probably accept Amaury's corrupted version of Bitcoin (Cash) if Amaury would one day choose to corrupt his Bitcoin ABC software. But then we (currency speculators) would just fork again to another Bitcoin (Cash) spinoff, and the miners would follow our money again just like they're following us to Bitcoin Cash this time. 

Hopefully Amaury will understand that it's in his best financial interest to stay uncorrupted because that will increase the value of his bitcoin coins the most. If he does not, we just fire him and hire a new set of developers and programmers."
This.
Who cares what public does? Stupid people are often end bankrupt. Look long-term. Markets ate like natural forces
"> Segwit2x actually had a shot at defeating BCH

Nope. The whole point of Bitcoin Cash was to abolish Segwit. Segwit2x could postpone Bitcoin Cash's development and I'm fine with it for lowering fees on the leading chain. The more activity in the whole Bitcoin network - the better"
">  It means goodbye Bitcoin Legacy.

Yep, and with it it means goodbye Bitcoin network effect, Bitcoin brand, Bitcoin market cap."
"Yeah? How much hashpower does Bitcoin cash have?

There can only be one chain with the same PoW longterm, else the chain is insecure. The Bitcoin cash chain survives because Bitcoin miners let them.

"
Jihan wants big blocks not miners unless you mean Jihan controls the mining industry 
I'm curious to see the continuation of BCH as the direct competitor to BTC.  The 1x/2x fork shadowed BCH from public exposure in the short term.
Not all of them.  The rest are wimps.
"Since the BCC fork millions of dollar flooded into Bitcoin (1MB). These people bought ""Bitcoin"" not ""Bitcoin cash"".

I don't give Cash any chance at becoming the dominant chain without Bitcoin losing the first position in market cap.

This is all a fucking mess and the miners didn't act rational at all. The incentive system did not work."
U'd trust no one. Bitcoin is math
True, miner can still go one with btc1
They might actually create a better coin then ours. We can't have that!
"Have you been paying any kind of attention?

BCH is what bitcoin was pior to SegWit, full blocks, RBF, not-usable-for-retail, unpredictable fees and confirmations.

BTC (SegWit1X) is unusable by comparison.
B2X (SegWit2X) was mostly about firing the Core dev team. Without a change in devs, the roadmap won't change. BTC will stay broken."
"That could happen. I don't understand why you're getting downvoted.

Maybe many people while supporting their coin of choice fail to see the bigger picture. If conspiracies about the legacy banking using Blockstream to kill mass adoption of cryptocurrency are true, then they have succeeded 100% so far towards their goal of herding masses towards being subjects of LN banks. Only the final link is missing now..."
They've had plenty of time. Don't hold your breath.
It's kind of expected with anything decentralized.  Moving forward is slow and difficult and there will be dead ends along the way.
"Against being cheated into activating segwit and not getting the 2x HF part of the deal.

No 2x HF, no segwit.

Seem fair to me."
I can only guess, but I think Jihan got played. They promised him x2 in exchange for Segwit and then once Segwit was in they told him he was alone.
I think bitcoin has topped.  There was that initial price spike for the idiots piling in, but it's now lower than it was when the fork-cancellation was announced.
We were at 7300 yesterday. This is not a drop lmao
Give it time.  Satoshi was almost the sole miner the first year, but he kept the project going.  Success is often about perseverance and pragmatism.
we are so fcked. bcc is no elixir, it will have serious problems surviving as a minority chain. s2x was our chance for big blocks on the majority chain. apparently jihan bought too many bcc alrdy...
"What is your goal for Bitcoin? If it's just to sit on a big pile of it and get richer and richer for no reason, sure, the price is all that's important.

If you want to actually *use* it, though, who cares what the price is? Buy $100 Bitcoin Cash and then spend it on something worth $100. The exact amount of coins that get transacted doesn't matter."

Too bad BTC fees are going to price most use cases off the blockchain. They'll have to use BCH instead. 
"> immutable, anti fragile, uncensored , secure transactions

Dogecoin is all of these things too"
"> immutable, 

Segwit allows part of the record to be pruned from nodes and miners. A coordinated miner action could lead to transactions being changed in the future.

> anti fragile, 

If bitcoin were accepted by a major retailer like Amazon or Walmart tomorrow you wouldn't be able to use it. A minor gambling site like Satoshi Dice could effectively break bitcoin.

> uncensored ,

For a relatively small amount of money you can censor all but the most wealthy of individuals from using the block chain to send money. The blocksize limit makes bitcoin easier to censor.

> secure transactions

Segwit actually has a lesser security model than standard transactions. This has been acknowledged by the devs.

>  this is extremely bullish news.

Yes for alts.

"> immutable, anti fragile, uncensored , secure transactions are bitcoin's most important aspects

Nope. They can just run btc1 code or abolish Segwit chain. One or the other eventually happen
The latter is economically inevitable, we just have to guess how much poison the other side will spit until it's over
So wait. Why is it Bitcoin Cash that has to succeed? Why does it matter if it's B2X, BCH, BTC, or any other coin that's successful? Is this a dick measuring contest or is it a fight for freedom in finance? Because I can't tell right now.

You realize that 95% of SW2x nodes were cloud hosts, probably run by a single or few individuals. So yes, the peer2peer community has spoken clearly and won.
They aren't in charge. But they all have weight
You can still have leaders in a P2P network. It's just that all the leaders in the bitcoin industry are spineless weasels who do not stand up for the network. They let trolls and astroturfers control the network.
There are more than one devs on the BTC1 team, and 80+% hash power used to support S2X and numerous Bitcoin related businesses as well.
Maybe legacy BTC should just die out then. Let the flippening happen.
I honestly don't understand why people are trying to rush this tech

>Yeah. Great. We now have

It's good for Bitcoin (cash) because that is now the only on-chain scaling Bitcoin. Bitcoin Legacy processes around 260ktx/day (and that's all it'll ever do), all cryptospace together processes around 6mtx/day. And it's only going to grow, zero of which is going to go to Bitcoin Legacy. The size of the economy is the underlying driver of valuation (speculation is the immediate driver, but that speculation is speculating on utility). It follows that with a growing economy, whoever can capture those transactions, gets the valuations that go with it. It means goodbye Bitcoin Legacy.

I was talking short-term, I am in agreement that btc hasn't even begin to peak. 
I'm not a trader, so I'm only interested in sustainable technologies with a clear purpose and strategy for achieving said purpose. I value a slow and steady open development processes with a heavy emphasis on academic research and testing. Monero is by far at the top of this game. The only downside that Monero has, which Bitcoin Cash has is multiple cooperating development teams. I'm uneasy with having only one development team, and only one implementation of the protocol. If Bitcoin Cash can prove to be a reliable source of solid technology, specifically technology for maximizing privacy and fungibility, while doing due diligence in auditing code additions (let's not be like Eth's Parity), then I would probably consider it to be superior to Monero. Until then, Monero it is.

"Well, specifically to your point: 
* Tulips cannot be broken down  
* Tulips are a poor store of wealth, because they rot  
* The rotting also means they are difficult to transport, if not impossible to transport before they lose worth.  
* The government can easily seize the shipment of all tulips.

The value of bitcoin comes from: 
* Bitcoin cannot be seized *easily* by any government. It is, in fact, designed with this scenario in mind. This is just one reason why decentralization is so important.  
* A bitcoin is immutable, it cannot expire, or be faked  
* bitcoin is extremely easy to transport 
* a bitcoin is infinitely divisible. If all but one bitcoin was lost to a paper wallet that got thrown into a fire by accident, a transaction could be generated that destroyed the 1 bitcoin, but created 21 million smaller coins that added up to 1 bitcoin, and the process could continue.

bitcoin's value is *derived* from these properties because of the *fundamental mathematics from which it is built upon*. Because SHA-256 is considered collision free, it allows for the assignment of value to computer processing in a way that does not require trust. I feel like this is a very powerful idea that is just presenting itself to us.  

Now whatever is speculated beyond that, that is up for debate. At this point, that is where your argument fits in perfectly. However, I dont think bitcoin will ever be valued less than at least the electrical cost that goes into it. "

Segwit moves the signatures, it doesn't *remove* them.  It's called ""Segregated Witness"", not ""Eliminated Witness"".

Like, I'm having a hard time even imagining how you think bitcoin would even be functioning today if the signatures were removed.  Bitcoin would be dead.  Everyone's coins would be stolen.  The whole system would no longer work.

For instance, ShapeShift has moved entirely to Segwit transactions.  How do you think they're operating?  Do you really think that anyone can just steal all of ShapeShift's coins?

Instead of helping Core to win their battle against SW2x, BCH users should have supported SW2X, simply because it had chances of making Bitcoin and thus all crypto better for the short term and it would have kicked out some of the most poisonous actors in the field.

[edit] You can downvote me, but I still haven't seen anyone explain why this wasn't a huge victory for Blockstream. They got everything they ever asked. If it's really the legacy banking sector that is backing them, now they can simply concentrate on suppressing BCH price for years to come.

"> Nodes don't matter. If they reject it the rest of the network routes around them

And that's why they've just called off a fork with 80% of hashrate? Nodes doesn't just mean some number of random computers that can be routed around, it means the network, community, markets. A transaction that steals someone's coins from a Segwit address is invalid under current consensus rules, so by allowing such transactions, you effectively make a hard fork. Unless you convince exchanges to accept the blocks you mine this way, it doesn't matter what you do. And I have a feeling that convincing exchanges to accept a ""Segwit stealing hard fork"" would be harder than convincing them to accept a ""2x blocks fork""...

Where do you know that from? I'd bet they are discussing it right now. It would be a stupid business decision to not even discuss it in the light of the current events.

A.) Lighting Network saves Blockstream's crippled Bitcoin and masses move to using centralized services that legacy banking builds on top of it. (normal users never ever even touch the blockchain as they get outcompeted by these big actors who settle huge sums at time)

B) Some other better performing crypto manages to build the brand recognition that surpasses that of 1MB Bitcoin before Lightning activates. (that could be Monero, BCH or whatever)

Big blockers who rallied against SW2x will slowly realize they were just tools that enabled another victory for Blockstream.

What I'm doing now is selling my bitcoins (held since 2013) for Monero and maybe a little in BCH. (Not interested in LN scenario at all)"
"You do realize that BCH and BTC share history prior to Aug 1 2017?

From my point of view, Bitcoin IS Bitcoin Cash. The fork in August created SegWit1X coin - which, honestly, is crap. The market in all its human magnificence hasn't figured that out yet.... but it will.

I'm VERY happy today that there is now zero chance that the SegWit1X coin will effectively compete with Bitcoin Cash on features and value proposition.

And no, there are no other coins that is as widely owned as Bitcoin Cash and SegWit1X. "

The EDA has been fixed and the fix will activate on 2017-11-13. If further spinoffs will be needed then those future spinoffs will just use the new DAA.

The divide and conquer opponents of Bitcoin will not be able to use the same trick several times. Eventually they'll run out of tricks and the version of Bitcoin that remains will have become resilient enough to no longer be corruptible.

That's what I think at this stage in the Bitcoin evolution. I may be wrong of course but I'm betting my money that I'm right. I hold fiat only to cover living expenses one year at a time.

They can damage a parallel chain's functionality temporarily and at a tremendous cost. A parallel chain can defend itself making this type of attack difficult, if not impossible to profit from. When discussing incentives its all about profit, not power. The power exists, if all hardware on the planet were allied, as you say. Bitcoin doesn't defeat that power, it motivates it to act appropriately, and it has.

For bitcoin, ""stagnation"" is a feature, not a bug. The inability to change it is what gives people confidence. The confidence that their money won't change at the whim of the latest fashion. That a random developer won't freeze all the funds in their wallets because ""*we has Turing complete scripting language!!!*"". The confidence that even giant business can't take control of bitcoin. That's the kind of confidence that, historically, only gold has had. And it's a difficult confidence to build, but very quick to lose. 

Long live a ""stagnant"" bitcoin!

it has always been known that there is no defense against a heavy capital attack.  that is to say, the hashpower follows the capital, so if the capital is willing to lead the hashpower off a cliff, then there's no defense against that.  in other words a rich fucker can put his thumb on the scale and incentivize miners to mine 0KB blocks if he's willing to push down hard enough.

and that, my friend, is exactly what happened.  For a price of a hundred million bucks or so, the world's financial revolution has been set back another 3 years or more."
"The incentives still work. I'm a big blocker but there is one thing the small blockers have right. Economic nodes trump all. The security of bitcoin is economic, not technical. Mining and hash power properly secure Bitcoin because the COST of electricity can only be spent on one chain or another. The miners only get paid if that chain is considered valid to enough economic nodes who together produce demand for miner effort. If there is sufficient demand, which is impossible to quantify, then there will be exchanges and miners who fulfill it. 

For any upgrade to succeed, whether it's a soft or hard fork, there MUST be **exclusive** support by a strong enough majority of the users themselves that no one sees profit in developing and sinking costs into rejecting it.

Segwit did not have consensus either but because of its construction as a soft fork its opponents had to take action to fulfill the demand for an alternative, and they did. The apparent demand for a non-segwit Bitcoin incentivized a fork to occur. This only occurred once Segwit could no longer be resisted in other ways.

If the dominant economic nodes and by extension their profit motive, based on the market for their services, are such that they cannot support an upgrade exclusively, then there is no consensus regardless of the miner signalling. 

Consensus is still possible for upgrades and the incentives still work."

*Use as a day to day currency is just one use case*. Without the mathematics it is nothing as it cannot be *verified in a trustless way*. When was the last time you purchased something with gold? But it is still worth ~1200 an ounce, yet no one carries around to gold to purchase things. But why is still worth so much? Well partially because the chemical composition of gold *cannot be easily reproduced*, in some way this is proofing. In bitcoin, this is accomplished through *mathematical* proofing, and the actual processing of the ledger is similar to the natural constructs that produce gold over millions of years (or however long, im not a chemist).  

It is all about the math, without the math, it is nothing, and would be the same as arcade coins. It is *not* just digital numbers, this is a poor way of looking at something as scientific as mathematical proofing. Immutability is a big thing.

Yes, under the previous pre-Segwit consensus rules - which no one is using since August... If anyone wanted to make such transaction, miners wouldn't accept it, and if a miner wanted to mine such transaction, nodes wouldn't accept it. There's plenty of money stored in Segwit addresses already (including all mine), why hasn't it all been stolen yet if it's that simple?
Not stealing money from anyone-can-spend addresses is part of the consensus rules now, so if you want to make transactions that do spend them illegally, you need a hard fork that changes the rules. You can do that, but you need to convince the whole community, which apparently even 2x couldn't do. You could just as well try to convince everyone to make a hard fork that allows stealing money from an arbitrary non-Segwit address X, you don't need Segwit for that.
Lightning network isn't going to happen. Bigger blocks aren't going to happen. Dump Segwit.

It's weird that this issue is happening in more than just the cryptos with scaling issues. I remember 2 years ago fees were almost a non-issue. I'd just send anything with the default wallet fee and it would never have a problem and the cost was so small I hardly even thought about it.
Is there a bot for this yet?
"I... don't think that's how Lightning Network works. LN is based on payment channels, and payment channels are specifically designed in such a way that you don't trust the person on the other side to not steal everything at once from you. There are some videos from talks that explain step by step how this is built, with some Alice sending money to Bob etc. It's super complicated specifically because it had to in order to be trustless.

If you had to trust someone in the network to not take your coins, the whole thing would be pointless. Think about it, in this case why wouldn't we all just use Coinbase accounts instead? Sending Bitcoins via Coinbase requires trust in Coinbase, but it's even faster and simpler than LN, because it's literally just adding/changing some rows in their SQL database.
"
I don't even understand what you're trying to say. Hashpower determines the rules. 
"I disagree with ""servants"" part. They're independent actors and self-employed. They bound by game theory to mine something useful, not cos they're ""paid"" by community. Math rules the mining, not people. That's why Bitcoin is trustless. U don't need to read r/bitcoin or r/btc, u don't need to listen to anyone to participate in this magical protocol. U can write your own software and transact whichever miners are choosing to do"
I don't know. I got the impression the terms were never fair.
[deleted]
It does. Luckily we might be able to fix them now that the Civil War is over.
Let's not forget that BTC can still fork again later, even next month if things get too dicey. The only issue with BTC (besides Segwit) remains the *refusal* to increase the blocksize cap, not the incapability of the increase. BCH *still* doesn't subsume all the interests of big blockers for this reason, though more than it did yesterday.
Short-term moves mean nothing. Bitcoin is still small, remember what happened in 2011-2013
It's unstable, but the miners have mastered dual stabilization. And it will only be easier with new EDA. So you have to ask yourself, since it's the miners who would choke one goose, why would they?

That's very decent of you. Normally any disagreement turns into a flame war on reddit.
When we hit 800 make sure you only sell a portion. Never sell all.

"One thing to keep in mind is that you only need most of that photo id nonsense to transfer fiat in and out. You can, for example, buy BTC, LTC or ETH on Coinbase (but you should really use GDAX instead to avoid fees, and it's the same account) and then transfer those to another exchange like Kraken, buy your BCH there. I sometimes use LTC because it has the lowest fees, but it also sometimes requires long confirmation times which is a pain, and BTC has a big advantage in having ""direct"" markets on most exchanged (e.g. on kraken you can directly buy BCH with BTC and maybe ETH, but not LTC)"

"Also if you think that legacy banking is behind Blockstream, good luck for Bitcoin Cash surviving that attack. They have endless reserves to short with.

Ironically I see many of the same nicks that accused Blockstream of this celebrate SW2x demise now."
"> The flippening is probably just days away.

Extremely unlikely now. Investors don't really care much about long transaction times and/or high fees. Whats 6 dollars to transfer a 7.5k dollar coin? That keeps on getting value like crazy? Its being stupid, thats what."
Bitcoin Cash is moving sideways on Kraken at the moment though.
"Thanks!

https://poloniex.com/exchange#btc_bch

It looks like BCHUSD may be stable but BTCUSD is rising so BTCBCH is rising as well"
Lesser scale. Let it grow
I strongly disagree. What this shows us that a small, corporate funded minority can exercise social control over the most valuable cryptocurrency. Blockstream has succeeded in crippling BTC, and there is little reason to think they can't do it again with BCH or any other competitor.
">I have the choice between a usable chain that isn't usable due to a missing economic network and that is very insecure (low difficulty) aka Bitcoin cash

New DAA coming in a week, market acceptable will only increased due to low fees.

It will comes.

But you can also sell and buy back when BCH will be more mature. You might have miss a lot of profit though.

With that being said there is some risk involved, it is completely fine not being ok with it and selling."

Legal authority isn't anyone. I am sorry I don't have time to educate you if you are unwilling to do any thinking yourself. I stopped reading after that first sentence"
It is true. Are you unaware of how Segwit works?
"> If anyone wanted to make such transaction, miners wouldn't accept it

You sure about that? I would have said the samething about the Etherium DAO fork 6 months before the DAO was created.

> if a miner wanted to mine such transaction, nodes wouldn't accept it. 

Nodes don't matter. If they reject it the rest of the network routes around them

> There's plenty of money stored in Segwit addresses already (including all mine), why hasn't it all been stolen yet if it's that simple?

If they started stealing them then Segwit would never be widely accepted. I am not suggesting they will steal everyones money, just it will be a tool that will be used occasionally to force compliance.
"
"> payment channels are specifically designed in such a way that you don't trust the person on the other side to not steal everything at once from you

[Lightning Network does not work the way you think it does.](https://lightning.network/lightning-network-paper.pdf) If you study it you will discover that fraud is prevented only by monitoring your channel partner to determine if he has published an invalid transaction.

If you are able to take your partner offline, then they cannot contest your channel breach remedy, and you can claim all the funds in the channel.  (if you try to get a lightning proponent to validate this they'll tell you it's not true, and give you a run around, but if you press on this you will learn it is true.)

Lightning is not ""fire and forget"" it is ""always listening."""

"> Whats 6 dollars to transfer a 7.5k dollar coin?

yeah, how could ever-higher fees possibly ever go wrong?"
I know that  Coinbase will allow users to withdraw BCH but they won't be supporting it for merchants afik. I hope bitpay does adopt it. I have to say it's definitely not as fun spending bitcoin as it used to be.
Economic majority trumps everything. Bitcoin isn't a democracy, though I guess majority of people is participating though Coinbase (NYA). Coinbase wants fast confirmations and cheap txs for a reason. Amount on non-mining nodes is irrelevant (Sybil attack)
Fierce ones. Just like Andreas predicted. Starting from the moment of the split people who are actively siding with each chain exclusively are using everything in their power to kill the other. Grab the popcorn and hedge your bets
You've dedicated countless hours to this community.  You deserve a whole lot more.
Anyone thought of rebranding bitcoin cash? Anything with bitcoin before it will be seen as an inferior copy? 
"You realize that ""bcash"" is the name trolls use to pretend it is something completely different from Bitcoin and stop normal users from asking ""what is this other Bitcoin""? They even don't want people to know they have Bitcoin Cash."

No they couldn't. This is proof they couldn't, because if they could have done it, they would have done it. You need clear economic consensus for a fork. The less concensus you have the higher risk you have of burning $100m mining worthless coins. Miners follow value which follows users, this has always been how it works in bitcoin.
"yes, and they could have activated BU back when larger blocks were the leading scaling solution, too.

They are the ones responsible for not doing the 2x HF part.
"Right? Holy shit, this childish mentality between /r/bitcoin and /r/btc is truly something. 

One the one hand, BCH is - according to people here - ""all about Satoshi's vision"" and ""real Bitcoin"" yet god forbid that a different coin actually achieves what Satoshi made a foundation for. Kinda shows you what the truth really is - that most people just want to get rich and hate the other side no matter what. Pathetic. I wish there would be a better bitcoin subreddit that's at least semi-active instead of this endless bullshitting between these two crappy communities."
Then a different coin will come and get ahead of both BTC and BCH. Instead you're actually glad that bitcoin is not getting fixed because it's better for BCH? What? That's like hoping Samsung and Google will fail so Apple can be kept alone. That would surely be great.

"Yeah Jihan, Jeff & Co. cheated us into SegWit and then weaseled out on 2MB part.

Sad day for crypto. I respected these guys, but it seems like everyone is ready to break their promises and lick Core's boots when things get rough."
Is bitcoin getting destroyed again? That seems to happen every year or so.
If fear of losing the brand means we can't overthrow hostile devs then Bitcoin already failed it's core mission: to be uncorruptible.
Lol that brand is well on its way to being dead anyways, let it become a martyr for mass crypto adoption, so be it.
Which is why I don't get the rivalry between this sub & r/bitcoin. Why people don't like to maintain diverse portfolios. Use BCH to buy stuff, hodl BTC for the appreciation. I for one like this segregation tbh.

"Sure it is never one to one. But AWS IPs are suspicious for such things by definition. They are used to create the illusion that many people are behind it. And if a huge percentage of your ""users"" have AWS IPs, you can assume that most of your users are not real people.

You are free to debate my points here on /r/btc even when this sub is not really about Ethereum.

"Patience. This happened like an hour ago.

"> U see, Jihan doesn't matter. Nakamoto consensus and game theory does

This is precisely why miners have very little power, why with a futures market at <15% they would not mine B2X **despite the 95% signaling**.

And of course they will mine BCH if more profitable, just like they did since its inception. But one of the mantras S2X was that ""*The legacy chain will die because it cannot survive on 5% hash power only!*"".  This is a great moment for anyone advocating ""miner power"" to seriously reconsider the entire ecosystem.

[This guy](https://medium.com/@bartjellema/why-i-just-bought-90-b2x-bitcoin-segwit2x-futures-f94d0ee13eb9) will certainly spend quite some time trying to figure out just what went wrong. Here's the tough lesson to be learned:

> * 58 companies located in 22 countries

> * 83.28% of hashing power

> *  5.1 billion USD monthly on chain transaction volume

> * 20.5 million bitcoin wallets


means jack shit. Anybody crying ""1CPU, 1 vote"" should let that sink in.

"You think it's a viable outlook, that Bitcoin will 

* fork off repeatedly, in the process fucking up the coin issuance (also by using the fucking EDA)
* fuck up the whole ecosystem repeatedly (wallets unusable, coin seperation), no economic support
* lose it's branding.

This is divide and conquer. Today I would say, that Bitcoin does not work, miners don't act in their self interest, the feedback isn't good enough for the system to work."
Why should it have problems surviving? It can survive at low hashrate, DAA is getting fixed in a few days, it has low fees, quick transactions with 0-conf which is ideal for merchants, etc.
The ultimate goal is to replace fiat currency, overall. Not just in my life, on  most people's lives. And that will only happen when hundreds of millions of people hold it. What would inevitably push the price up dramatically. You cannot separate these things. 
5cents for me with segwit
Yes, yes ... too bad. \*cough\*
dogecoin changed the monetary supply 
Yikes maybe you are right, I wasn't watching the price today. Looks like I just got my confirmation of what to do with my remaining BTCs. 
"So, you think that blockstream AND everyone else colluded and Jihan is the one being played?

That's, uhmm... innovative"
I feel you. Let's just hope the hash power starts coming back towards bitcoin cash.
"Or everybody loses because we now have inflated the coin issuance and have an insecure, low difficulty Bitcoin cash chain...


Short term price indicates not much. Markets love certainty and we now have certainty, that core devs rule Bitcoin and that the mining incentives don't work. That might be good short term, it will be bad long term."
I think a lot of people have heard that message and the sad fact is that even having heard it there's still a lot more capital sitting on the other side of the table, but we shall see.

"> Core won!

Core always wins. Defeated your bcash too.

Stop being tools exploited by Roger Ver. Big blocks are retarded idea to try since we just got 50% increase with SegWit.

If SegWit is used close to max and blocks are full, and it's not just spam from miners, then real Bitcoin can look at even x2 bigger blocks. But hopefully there would be no need, as payment channels and LN will do that first anyway and solve all this problems forever.

That is terrible news for people betting on the mayhem.
"I must say I'm generally critical towards Bitcoin and especially for the store of value argument. Therefore I liked the approach Cash was taking to be a useable currency. But it seems greed has won? Who cares if it is reasonable to pay with BTC when everybody is just in for the quick riches? And again, I'd that as an altcoin holder I've got a third perspective on this whole thing. Anyway, to me this disqualifies BTC forever. They didn't let the market decide but manipulated the hell out of the public to stop the decision making process. And this thing claims to be decentralized? Yes, sure, and Donald Trump is the good samaritan. Anyway, just here to let you know: I support Bitcoin Cash and I'm done with BTC after this shitshow. Besides, all the Altcoins had to suffer for this ""build up"". Thanks for nothing Core."
"Stupid played...  
If we had UASF let happen and BIP91 was just increasing blocks then UASF would have failed hard and we would have BTC with bigger blocks and no Shitwit.  
Bitcoin Cash wont happen and Scamgold also not. There would be one chain with bigger blocks since 3 months already...  
Now it will be a long road for Bitcoin Cash."
"The way I see it, this is good news for everyone. 
Big blockers will still have Bitcoin Cash while the other camp has SegWit and an unchanged blocksize like they wanted.

Now we just wait and let the free market decide."

"It wasn't the trolling, it was a lack of true miner support as I've been saying.  People were signaling one thing but saying another thing-that they were gonna mine segwit1x, etc.

So there was no real conviction behind the 2x fork.  BCH lives because the folks who support it are passionate about it and willing to put money on the line and argue for it.

Now we get to see for ourselves whether on chain scaling or second layer solutions work better.  This might be safer as well, who knows what happens when governments can attack LN hubs"

it's real, jeff garzik posted in the btc1 slack.
"This was the plan all along. Garzik was in on it. Core was in on it. Reddit mods were in on it. I say fuck 'em all.

"ITT: Bad losers

Guys, seriously, this is great news for both BTC and BCH. Leave behind the childish ""winner/loser"" mentality and enjoy the ride.

We now have a healthy competition for the two ""opposite"" scaling solutions: on-chain/off-chain. Without the absurd disruption that was about to be caused by S2X a completely political move that didn't really have any consensus whatsoever (as demonstrated by this announcement).

If you believe in big blocks, very good for you, bet for the big blocks platform and you may win big. If you believe in off-chain scaling, very good for you too and the same applies.

This also brings you the opportunity to hedge your bets holding both in the proportion that is more confortable with your inclination.

This is sad day for BitCoin. We just learned how propaganda and censorship can steer the way of bitcoin future. I’ll increase my BCH holdings in following days (DCA) since I believe that BitCoin with Core developers who have absolute control is dead end.

You don't need to pin a thread that is already at the top. In fact, pinning it hides it, because most people are blind to pins, just like they're blind to ad banners.
Yeah looks like 80% hashpower wasn't enough and twitter trolling saved (or ruined, depending on perspective) the day.

Financially, I like that SegWit 2x has failed so that the market has only 1x and Cash to choose from, making it clearer for the decision why Cash has more utility, and thus appreciating my investment.


Morally though, due to the already agreed compromise, I would have liked to see SegWit 2x succeed over 1x, thus removing the toxic 1x developers and proponents who are behind all the propaganda and community split."
This is a peer2peer community with no leaders. Yet douchbags are still in charge.
"Well Jeff Garzik lost the last bit of respect from me. This is just beyond insane after so many months and so many companies supporting s2x and users waiting for a moment to finally be able to use bitcoin again.
If anything I hope the 80% of miners will just run s2x, and see what the market decides. Thank god we still have BCH, although the professionalism is hard to find in these teams as well... closed door decisions, shitty code/EDA, lack of proper reviewing, short noted hard forks.. etc
All in all it seems bitcoin will just go down the drain as it has been going for over 2 years now. I don't care if it becomes a million dollar a pop, its useless at the moment and thus has no value to me as an end user, id even go so far to say its a pyramid scheme these days. Time will tell if our ""core"" leaders will ever do something to make it useable again in the future."

"Looks like the segwit2x fork has been suspended .

https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-segwit2x/2017-November/000685.html

This is great news, and represents the community coming together and not splitting more. It also represents bitcoin being resistant to attacks from those that wish to impose changes without the consent of the economic majority of users.

Some may be disappointed that they won't be getting their B2X coins but consider all the market uncertainty holding bitcoin price back and now how we can really grow together as a united community. I expect a very bullish future for bitcoin.

Congratulations Every Bitcoin supporter.


We move forward with segwit adoption (which increases capacity) and scaling with schnorr sigs , MAST while working on a safe HF in the longterm and Lightning network

Price goes up before the fork because fork = free $$.  Price goes up when fork is canceled because controversy is over.  Whatever happens, price goes up.
Tethers+Corefinex? What could be unnatural?
"And price is falling back to $7509 as I type this...

This is actually GREAT news. The biggest threat to Bitcoin Cash was that a new team of developers might start fixing it and making it more competitive with the features Bitcoin Cash has (and Bitcoin had) as well as potentially scaling it enough to make fees and confirmation times comparable with Bitcoin Cash. This was a long shot possibility, but now the chance is zero."
Any news is good news during hype
"Aaaaand... the price just hit a new ATH

"
This is not how it works. BTC is still extremely valuable as digital gold. It is that it would be twice as valuable as digital cash. Well I guess Bitcoin Cash will have to work towards that.
Which rocket ship are you on? Well, I guess it's best to stay neutral...
Whatever happens, open blockchains succeed
Keep that popcorn bowl handy, the drama is far from over. 
"> Holy war is canceled

U got it wrong. It'll be uglier until current chain split is resolved. 3-way would lessened pressure on Bitcoin Cash, now we'll get the full blows"
Seconded!
"Jeff's plan was to announce Metronome™ 

Keep in mind that he also is part of the network congestion problem, along with a couple of vocal miners and CEOs"
"ViaBTC did stop signalling for NYA.
They now signal ""Bitcoin Cash"""
Bitcoin.com will go all-in on BCH now according to /u/memorydealers (Roger Ver): http://archive.is/hABGX
[Hopefully](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/750z6m/bitcoin_dot_com_will_move_to_bcash_if_2x_fails/do2mjyt/?context=3).
"A thought for the miner that genuinely thought they would get 2x HF after segwit... **for a second time**

"
I will believe it when the miners stop signalling and send out their own messages that are cryptographically signed.
"Is this not major bullish for bitcoin cash?

Markets can act irrational fair enough but its going to become apparent that segwit coin is near useless when its costing triple digits to simply make a transaction with unknown wait times. First mover advantage is a hell of a thing thats for sure.
"
Do you have any proof that they run it?
We have Bitcoin Cash. We won 3 months ago.
"> the idea behind Bitcoin has been effectively killed

How so? Crippled chain and whitepaper chain are fighting right now"
Are you going to sell all of your Bitcoin Segwit and Bitcoin Cash coins now? Why sell your Bitcoin Cash coins? They're what Bitcoin was always intended to be.
Core is not fucked they got full authority on BTC.
Miners have final say about the HF
Makes sense why Jeff Garzik announced his own project on October 24th. They knew about this for at least a month. 
This really begs the question... WTF!? It can't just be called off.
"> I'm moving on to greener pastures. 

Where are those? :)"
"You have it all wrong. **The market** didn't get behind S2X. Just like they didn't get behind BCH.

S2X was a powergrab, and it was doomed from the start."
Well to be honest the 85% is in no way based on user/community support but on miner support. I still thought big blockers were in majority.
[deleted]
The btc (Segwit2x) software already exists, and is run by many miners and nodes. Isn't it possible the fork will still happen if some miners run it anyway?
"Open source, buddy.  Don't like him or his proposals? don't support him.  Ain't no ""leaders"", only people with ideas other people support.   "
"Yes.

Yes, you are.

I hope you were not blindly following them when they told you to sell your BTC"
well bch pumpers will enjoy. unless blockstream pulls ln out of their ass now that they have been given (a lot) more time, and bch ends up the altcoin core always wanted it to be.
All they needed to do is to include the mention of Bitcoin Cash into the letter. Political correctness is bullshit
\*facepalms\*
"> we are lead by douchbags

Is this news to you?"
"Yes.

Yes you are.

I honestly hope you were not blindly following when they told you to sell your btc"
I hope the miners take back the signaling for segwit blocks as the 2x part has not been accepted. That or just abandon the chain for Bitcoin cash and let the Flippening happen. 
Miner should refuse to include segwit transactions in protest.
Haha!!! Core is fucked. LONG LIVE BITCOIN (CASH)
This outcome was planned. The agreement should have been segwit+2x immediately as a HF. There was 0 reason to delay 2x by 3 months except to allow Blockstream paid shills to do their thing. Also, jgarzik has been a well meaning useful idiot all along (from the unlimited days).
Don't forget falling for the HKA which stopped classic. 
"I'm not sad. I've got Bitcoin Cash and the small blockers have their retarded[1] Bitcoin Segwit spinoff coin. Competing with the small blockers is like competing with retards. Unfair but to our advantage. Long term we'll win.

Intentionally retarded to just 6 transactions per second."
Dont worry. We will continue with our hope of Bitcoin Cash and we will make it successful in the long run.
Hello ethereum. Your bugs are still better than Core.
"Garzok been droppin balls for a long time, he's mastering it now.

Metronome™ coming soon"
This.  Roger ver and jihan seem incredibly foolish
"No it's bad. Bitcoin cash isn't Bitcoin and if the big block miners think that they'll get their way with Bitcoin cash they are fucked.

This is very bad news."
">I give it 48hrs before Bitpay say they will start accepting it.

I was wondering if they aren’t waiting for the DAA fix."
Bigger the business more time is needed to switch
"!RemindMe 48h

If true, merry Xmas. "
Holy shiiiiit. Time to dump, boys.
"Yes. DCG, Silvert's company, is an investor in Blockstream. They simulated a fight with Core to get Bigblockers support for segwit2x to pass segwit, and then betrayed the agreement. It has worked like a charm.

These people are manipulative and not to be trusted, but key players keep trusting them."
I think the new york agreement was to get segwit, but forking to 2x seems a little pointless after forking to 8mb (cash)
The fuck are you talking about? This isn't blockstream pulling out this is Ver and co. Forking off early (violating the NYA) then pulling out of a hostile takeover when they realised they can't win.
"You mean the greedy bullies that wanted Bitcoin dead when S2X took over? and wanted the ""flippening"" to happen for BCH?

Yep, they got wrecked. And guess what, they would've still gotten wrecked if 2x had gone trough. But much harder, since S2X was valued higher than BCH."
They should change the PoW. It's literally the best scenario. More valueable data for everyone, peaceful divorce. Or Bitcoin Segwit will be wiped later. Drama isn't over yet
"> What's next? Core changing the POW?

Do you even get what just happened?  Miners just showed their cards.  They refuse to fork unless there is community consensus.  Why in the world would anyone from core advocate a POW change now?  We just proved that the miners are beholden to us.  They work for us.  We have the power.

Nakamoto consensus works.  Miners don't dictate the protocol.  The community does.  The miners will mine wherever the value is."

This is good for Bitcoin Cash^^TM
"So, we surrender. Blockstream has won, the idea behind Bitcoin has been effectively killed and the currency will be a ridiculous SWIFT 2.0.

Mike Hearn was right all along. I knew he was smart, but I just wanted to believe and kept hoping.

Sad."
This is amazing. Big money heading to BCH after this period of uncertainty is over. Core will never give up control of repo. I don't doubt pressure was put on some people. 
So will there be a bunch of unemployed Trolls now? 
**BitcoinCash = the real Bitcoin**
[removed]
Look at the exchange rate: The market thinks its positive that this corporate attack on bitcoin has been canceled.
Yes! Great news!! Hopefully all remaining bigblockers will move to BCH. Out of courtesy lets thank the S2X side for calling this madness off. I only wish they did it much earlier.
Inb4 the hordes of trolls come gloating and yadda yadda yadda.
I’m new to Bitcoin. Can someone please explain to me how/why this fork cancellation will cause Bitcoin to die and Bitcoin Cash to begin flourishing? Will the value of Bitcoin literally drop as a result of this news? If that’s the case, how so?
"I never really understood the value proposition of S2X anyway.

If you're for on chain scaling then Bitcoin cash was already the fork you needed.

If you're for the Bitcoin core Dev team's strange technical choices then  core is for you.

Why would anyone want the core Dev choices with a tiny, near negligible tweak? Neither side of the debate seemed to get what they wanted from it.

So I'm glad that's over. Sorry for the Devs who put time in on it, but why don't you guys work on bch instead from here on in?"
Et tu, Brute?

Whoa...

Yeah sure looks brutal... It hit a new ATH for christ sake!"

Also look how serious altcoins are taking off and people are selling their fraudcoin bcrash shite because it's worthless shit. fuck BCH and all the shills on here representing it. Long live core and decentralized blockchain currencies that don't try to pull a fast  one (as BCH tried unsuccessfully to do). 

Finally, thanks for my fans upvoting me against a hostile sea of bitter BCH supporters.

disaster averted, congrats everybody on the wrong side of the argument according to this sub!
bcash to the mooooooon 
McAfee was right: Jihan is a clever guy. Jihan played the go game better than Core. Mmh, what about McAfee's other prediction?
"What a shame.
What a scam."
"lolololol

Fucking pathetic. Oh well, long live Bitcoin Cash."
It never had that
I feel so sorry for those who are left behind, with their backlogged 1mb chain: https://twitter.com/monsterbitar/status/928369660923392000
Yes, now the community will unite.
I was also worried about the separation of the soft and hard forks.  It seems that fear was well-placed.  I would really like to know how they came to the decision to call off SegWit2X and why.  Even in the past 24 hours, SegWit2X signalling was 80%.  With that level of miner support, it is extremely unlikely that a capacity-constrained minority chain would be successful.
This is actually GREAT news. The biggest threat to Bitcoin Cash was that a new team of developers might start fixing it and making it more competitive with the features Bitcoin Cash has (and Bitcoin had) as well as potentially scaling it enough to make fees and confirmation times comparable with Bitcoin Cash.

Good.
wow.
Who cares man just move on to bitcoin cash
"I'll switch back to BU and Classic nodes now.  
I had updated most nodes to BTC1."

This feel like a hilarious case of I told you so from everyone who knew segregated witness has no chance on it's own merits and had to be forced in via a shady compromise.

Woke up at the bottom of the drop, had a small heart attack, but we are back on track!
Should have went with my initial instincts that J.Garzik in no way legit. He can focus on his scam coin now, and Bitcoin cash can proceed on its way to the top crypto.
Has this been verified, btw?
"Que ""Metronome™ is the real bitcoin"""

Now everyone that bought because they wanted a free coin, will start selling. 
"I posted the below  in /r/BitcoinMarkets earlier I figure I may as well post it here. Although I whole heartedly expect to be downvoted by /r/bch for this I'd still like to share my thoughts as someone who did advocate for Segwit2x. 

It's done, it's over with, 2x is dead before it even had a chance to be born and the market has spoken clearly, it's happy with this and that's what matters most. 

It's sad we couldn't of come to agreement over the simplest of changes but we couldn't and no consensus means no change as is the way of Bitcoin and that is what is most important first and foremost. May as well avoid the turmoil in fighting a loosing battle. 

I would of liked to see 2x succeed but I am not sad that it has died. This wasn't about picking a fight, this isn't about ""us vs them"", ""my way or the high way"". This was about putting an option on the table and embracing what Bitcoin is regardless of what constitutes it, embracing consensus not in rejection there of and consensus is blocks at 1 MB in size.

While I'm sad I didn't sell my BT2 futures when I was at an unrealized profit and lost 0.07 BTC on this trade, oh well that's only a small slice of my pie and at least I my investment in an L3+  will pay off and be well worth my wild.
"
Ver paid them a million to avoid paying 10million on his BTC/B2X bet xD
"So while all of the community's majority was in fo 2x, as frequently reiterated in this subreddit by diverse individual reddit profiles, these 6 people decided in a closed door meeting to call off segwit!

Let the community decide and continue segwit2x, let's ignore garzik and verhoos, and even Jihan Wu, let's call for our saviours Barry Silbert and Roger Ver, who did not sign that letter."
I'm happy that they chose to go with keeping the community together. Eventually a solution will be found that's less contentious.
"Hahahhahahaha

and now you guys are going to try to get some shitcoin, BCash, to try and succeed. 

Good luck!

hahahahahha"
The community is so split it can NEVER be united again.
"There's a really simply explanation as to why this fork didn't happen yet:

- Segwit2x was adding 2MB blocks to Segwit which can already support ~2-4x more transactions than pre-Segwit. 

- At the moment, however, Bitcoin is nowhere near capacity for their blocks. 

- The fork would have just further fractured the community on the Segwit side. 

- The better solution on their side is to wait for blocks to get more full and then push for a S2X fork which keeps the community together.

Edit: Downvotes for this? I choose to believe this is a small reactionary response and not the actual beliefs of this community."
"I just want to say, we are all bitcoiners together, jihan, roger, everyone. why not get rich together?

this decision to call of 2x is great for everyone, and its the right and logical choice. we ALL have too much money at stake.

Im happy for all bitcoiners.

If you truly hate segwit and bitcoin, bitcoin cash is there for you.

I Have no hard feelings towards anyone and lets all get rich together"
With out a hash power split on the BTC chain, does this kill the flippening?
I just moved a lot of my coins into my new Ledger Blue yesterday evening. Guess if moving BCH back into an exchange that requires 6 confirmations is fast?
"ITT: everyone is angry and upset.

[Meanwhile, r/Bitcoin is happy that the community can come together and stop fighting.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7bmpnn/segwit2x_cancelled/dpj4xzq)"
For how long will the flippening be delayed?
Livecoinwatch is behaving erratically from all the sudden traffic. This is gonna be a tale for a lifetime. 
"I found myself in the last months very at odds with many statements from the signees, but all's forgotten! I draw my hat for this courageous decision and trust that it helps to bring the community back together.

Congrats and cheers to:

Mike Belshe, Wences Casares, Jihan Wu, Jeff Garzik, Peter Smith and Erik Voorhees!

Great news . Now time to use segwit everywhere.
Rip bcash
CME futures is the real short-term danger to crypto, the S2X folks did the right thing for survival. 
Can someone I5 what this means and what will it result to a noob to to the technical aspect of Bitcoin?
Bitcoin chugging along as designed.  Meanwhile BCH is still not bitcoin. 
Reading these comments it seems like /r/btc is a BCH sub now?
"Nothing unexpected.

"Just go look at the mempool. Blockchain.info is shows 43k unconfirmed TXs, and over 100 BTC in fees.
https://blockchain.info/unconfirmed-transactions

Is it broken?"
Please ask exchanges and services to add SegWit deposit/receiving address support now. It's a practical blocksize increase that we already have, no fork necessary.
ethereum classic and dogecoin have lower fees, why don't you use them?

No, this is sadly mostly idiots. Not necessarily on the user, but on the wallet programmers that put way too high fees on things."
What's this mean for BCH now?
Spot on 
[deleted]
[deleted]
It's probably why Litecoin broke out yesterday too. The BCH pump however stated earlier and is down today in this news so not much sure if that was correlated to the canceling of 2x. 
Agreed. I was holding out for 2x. Now that it's gone BTC is toast. The more I look into SegWit, the more it becomes clear it's trash. Time to make the switch to Bitcoin Cash!
Whenever Blockstream decides, that's when it'll get it. 
"I agree with you, it is a great news for large blocker.

The sad thing is atrosurfing and censorship as a tool to manipulate consensus has been **strongly** re-enforced.

Trolling against BCH will be off the charts in the coming months.."
"The idea is to force people onto lightning network hubs and segwit addresses. Trezor is already forcing its users onto Segwit addresses. Once they succeed and everyone is using lightning network for 90%+ of their transactions they will slowly increase the blocksize always keeping it small enough that people cannot afford not to use on chain transactions for anything other then opening up hubs

Now that we have segwit addresses all it will take is to identify a terrorist or some other bad guy with money that needs to be seized. We saw how easy it was to do with Etherium, now that the signatures are removed we can do this without issue.

Bitcoin has become BankCoin"
"> if bitcoin can't get bigger blocks now with over 80% hashpower agreeing, then when will it?

Your problem is that you still think miners are somehow relevant in making the rules. They're not. Miners enforce the rules, they don't make them. Bitcoin will get bigger blocks when there's compelling consensus for it. "
">  I have no reason to hold my BTC anymore. 

You are in the minority holding BTC for altruistic reasons.

more than 99% of people hold it to profit.

Why hold BTC?  Because it really may go to $100,000"
I think most people disagreed basically because Core said they wouldn't accept it. If Core at some point comes up with a hard fork plan they agree with - and as I understand it, it's not impossible, it just needs to be really thought through, with plenty of time for planning, testing and upgrading etc. - then the group of people who are so strongly against larger blocks that they wouldn't switch even if everyone else switches will be so small that they really won't matter. It would be smaller than Ethereum Classic I think.
"When it actually needs it. 

The lie wasn't that we needed bigger blocks. The lie was that we needed it now, without resounding consensus. "
"This is where you guys don't get it.

There's a huge support of bigger blocks at r/Bitcoin. I for one would be happy to get bigger blocks, IF it was agreed upon the right way and had consensus.

NOT if a few business owners had a private deal to force it on to the network (without replay protection). That was fucking shameful.

Propose a safe implementation and more people will support it then you think. Leave this sub a bit more often and you'll see that.

Just sayin"
core owns bitcoin. 
Hashpower does not dictate changes in the code, mmmmkay?
Is censorship resistance not important to you? Why are you in this space? If you don't mind me asking.
I mean... if you dont need your BTC you can give it to me and I'll dispose it for you...
"I'm sorry for you and all other 2x supporters.

To me, it was clear from the beginning that 2x didn't have enough supporters and too many people hostile to it. There's little point to a compromise solution when most people don't want to compromise."
How exactly are you fucked? I mean I feel like we're all fucked because Bitcoin is fucked but how does being a supporter makes you more fucked?

Dang. I was looking forward to Roger collecting that B2X bet from the Coreans. :|

"This concedes all the infrastructure of Bitcoin to Core. No other cryptocurrency, no Bitcoin Cash will have as much adoption before years, despite all the positive propaganda.

This is a disaster. This is giving full power to Core."
We'll all just have to deal with the price skyrocketing and/or use BCH.
BTC has been overtaken by hodlers. We have BCH, we don't have to give a shit about them.
That's why Bitcoin Cash exists. 
And services like BitPay. It is not like they have a choice now.
Yes we all said that and nobody listened, and sadly, now nobodys still listening.

Yup, all lies and deceit. They've got problems over there.
the real update was Bitcoin Cash
Kind of sad to see some big blockers get fleeced yet again because they are weak minded without a back bone to follow through on promises. Oh well, we live and we learn. Maybe it's time to divert attention over to Bitcoin Cash now. 
Thank Satoshi, literally!
If bitcoin cash fork didn't happen, S2X might have.  
"Ouch. Muh wallet.

Oh well, BCH should still appreciate once this blows over. Edit: 12 hours later, it's blown over."
congrats to 2x team.  Great integrity, which is something I commend to the whole bitcoin community post mtgox.
What does this mean for /u/MemoryDealers bet?
Wrong. 1.6 MB blocks  are bigger than 1 MB blocks. 
"I’m honestly not even passionate about this bitcoin and bitcoin cash debate.

As a programmer and computer scientist I know that neither coin in its current state will achieve scaling for a global user base. So I truly think there is more of an argument culture going on here just because.

I truly appreciate the idea that increasing the blocksize makes it harder to run a full node for the average global citizen (think someone in Africa or Venezuela on low bandwidth). I also know that BTCs fees and speed are not at all great with the current scaling limits. We need to find a better solution to that handles both of these antagonistic issues.

With all of that said, bitcoin cash gives you what you want. It was also done outside the agreement. Don’t you think that it is possible if that coin didn’t exist then the fork would have happened? I know there is a culture of finger pointing on Reddit but don’t you see how the presence of this coin vastly complicated things?

Also don’t you see how an agreement for a coin who’s reason for value is being owned by no one is somewhat useless?

No one owns BTC man and for bitcoin cash I truly hope there is no central player either.

God bless don’t be so angry on the internet. The market will decide who wins in the long term. "
"> Just as predicted when the NYA was proposed:

Just as everyone besides this circlejerk predicted: /r/btc/ pumping of B2X is nonsense same as pumping of BCash, both failed hard.

As will all attacks on the real Bitcoin, and on it's developers - Bitcoin Core.

Enjoy your weak and failing alts :)"
Actually it was Satoshi who killed 2X with his tweet.
Did Bitgo get threatened into backing down or something? It's odd.
"baahahahah bcash and b2x shitcoin lose.

BITCOIN KING FOREVER!!"
"As someone who mines on that pool, I can tell you that they are open about the functionality they offer and are committed to giving *miners* the choice. As a *miner*, I respect that.

Whereas you appear to be making the __classic logical mistake__ that the pool is the miner or that a miner is subject to the dictat of a particular pool. 

i.e. Should the bitcoin.com pool restrict my choices in a way that I disagree, I can simply choose to move my hashpower vote elsewhere. Not an outcome I forsee given the honorable and clearly stated actions of the bitcoin.com pool thus far.

So NO, nobody, not ""even Roger"" can tell me, __as a miner__, what to do.
"
Not only that, but also create more links to Bitcoin Cash through the site and live fee comparison
They should mine what is most profitable. Period.
Wtf I was waiting for the post B2X crash to buy more. Everyone buy now omg!!!!
Even Roger isn't that stupid.
Just keep an eye on the unconfirmed transaction /mempool information
"It would be interesting to know why Jihan weaseled out of this.

The agreement is already in effect so how can they cancel 2x part without canceling SegWit also? I'm disappointed and feel cheated."
"How it was determined?

There was only one developer working on it, who went off to run his ICO, was that not a signal to shut it down?

The fact that noone was working on it was a huge red flag, and should be enough for any sane person, no?

Not to even mention the fact that there was no community support and it was only pushed by corporate interests."
If chain still happens, it'd be epic!
I thought that the hard fork was baked in and could not be canceled?
"> The miners are who executes the decision, not the devs, so it's odd for this to be coming from the dev mailing list. 

It's almost like their colluding.... hm.

edit: OTOH it could just be people still clinging to traditional power structures.  For the same reason, some people are saying there's only one alternative to BTC now.  In reality there are quite a few other supported, developed chains, such as Bitcoin Unlimited and Bitcoin ABC.

BTC only got coverage and popularity due to lead devs going with it, not miners."
Interesting times, happy to be a part of this :)
Pre-traded Segwit2x value dropping like crazy https://coincodex.com/crypto/segwit2x/, market going all green!
It should be obvious to anyone that 2x was contentious. Hell, even Jihan saw that.

Someone has to do something right for once."
"This is actually GREAT news. The biggest threat to Bitcoin Cash was that a new team of developers might start fixing it and making it more competitive with the features Bitcoin Cash has (and Bitcoin had) as well as potentially scaling it enough to make fees and confirmation times comparable with Bitcoin Cash. This was a long shot possibility, but now the chance is zero.

I have bad news. You can't rollback segwit. 
"we all like to hope that it does, but in reality, it doesn't - in the near term

Long term, it will hinder it greatly"

You were right. 
There is already BitcoinCash if you think Big block is the way to go. Why does every chain has to have big blocks? Don't try to make everything fall under your philosophy, make the best of what you already have.
You don't deal with tyrants by giving them everything they want then hoping for good will in return.
"When you say ""they"", you mean the majority? That's the whole reason this was called off, because the majority don't want larger blocks. It's a democracy and we don't want larger blocks. It's not core, just look at every vote, look at the nodes, look at everything. The majority don't want larger blocks! This isn't a conspiracy."
"> Yup, all lies and deceit. They've got problems over there.

I'm rofling so hard right now"
"Welcome /u/BitcoinXio you'll find the ecosystem ready and waiting

https://www.bitcoincash.org/"
War of ideas is never easy
"Yeah I thought they would have learned from the HK agreement. :)

I guess with this cancellation all hope for Bitcoin is lost.

It will be a long road for Bitcoin Cash or any other alt to get into the position and brand awareness that Bitcoin got. Crypto has been pushed few years back atleast."
"Core won!

Bitcoin is dead long live bitcoin cash."
"wow  
much decentralized  
very consensus"
Don't conflate block weight with block size.
"I ""predicted"" Core would never accept 2X (and I still believe they would have ended in their imaginary minority chain) as well, but never could I have imagined Garzik would call off this thing.

Oh well. I think I'm getting ready, jessquit, to jump onboard your ""BCH is the real Bitcoin"" ship. SW1x certainly isn't bitcoin, although it retained the potential to be corrected.

I do have a couple of suspicions about why they would do this (it can't be for fear of losing, at least if they believed, as I know Garzik to do, in the consensus-forcing incentives for bitcoin HFs), but I guess we'll have to wait and see now what happens. 

At the very, absolute least, we can all focus our attention on BCH."
"Is this for real or a scam?  How can we confirm?

Edit: it's real, markets already in turmoil.  Interesting times indeed.

**FULL TEXT HERE**

The Segwit2x effort began in May with a simple purpose:  to increase the
blocksize and improve Bitcoin scalability. At the time, the Bitcoin
community was in crisis after nearly 3 years of heavy debate, and consensus
for Segwit seemed like a distant mirage with only 30% support among miners.
Segwit2x found its first success in August, as it broke the deadlock and
quickly led to Segwit’s successful activation. Since that time, the team
shifted its efforts to phase two of the project - a 2MB blocksize increase.

Our goal has always been a smooth upgrade for Bitcoin.  Although we
strongly believe in the need for a larger blocksize, there is something we
believe is even more important: keeping the community together.
Unfortunately, it is clear that we have not built sufficient consensus for
a clean blocksize upgrade at this time. Continuing on the current path
could divide the community and be a setback to Bitcoin’s growth. This was
never the goal of Segwit2x.

As fees rise on the blockchain, we believe it will eventually become
obvious that on-chain capacity increases are necessary. When that happens,
we hope the community will come together and find a solution, possibly with
a blocksize increase. Until then, we are suspending our plans for the
upcoming 2MB upgrade.

We want to thank everyone that contributed constructively to Segwit2x,
whether you were in favor or against. Your efforts are what makes Bitcoin
great. Bitcoin remains the greatest form of money mankind has ever seen,
and we remain dedicated to protecting and fostering its growth worldwide.

">Continuing on the current path

Mother fucker the community is **ALREADY** divided! Continuing the Status Quo will only further that division!

>As fees rise on the blockchain, we believe it will eventually become obvious that on-chain capacity increases are necessary.

Eventually? This was obvious a year ago! I got prompted to pay a fourteen dollar transaction fee on a seven dollar transaction three days ago!

This is some serious horseshit."
I completely understand your reasoning. It's your hardware and you should choose what chain to strengthen and earn rewards from. However, I would expect Roger to keep his word and not allow mining of segwitcoin on the bitcoin.com pool. Just as I would expect miners like you to find another pool to continue supporting the chain you believe in. Cheers.
That is a narrow-minded response. There is more to this than $$ in the eyes of the wise.
Are you sure he won't do what he says he will do
U can't please Blockstream with bigger blocks. But should u?
This is big Fuck You in BitPays face. Their business model is dependent on low fees and after this, they will either switch chains or get rekt
This is very interesting. Will BitPay move to become a B2B layer now, or will they adapt and support both chains, so that there is a consumerfriendly alternative to pay with?
I expect a lot of announcements about BCH support incoming. BitPay will of course be the first unless they want to go out of business.
"Can BTC do this?
gild u/tippr"
"...and why Segwit bitcoin should be called ""Bitcoin Crash,"" or will be."
This is actually GREAT news. The biggest threat to Bitcoin Cash was that a new team of developers might start fixing it and making it more competitive with the features Bitcoin Cash has (and Bitcoin had) as well as potentially scaling it enough to make fees and confirmation times comparable with Bitcoin Cash. This was a long shot possibility, but now the chance is zero.
"> As a programmer and computer scientist I know that neither coin in its current state will achieve scaling for a global user base. 

> increasing the blocksize makes it harder to run a full node for the average global citizen

As a programmer and a computer scientist, then please explain why on Earth you believe the average global citizen should be required to verify **every single transaction that has ever happened or ever will happen** just to use Bitcoin?

I don't think you understand Bitcoin or its scaling issues as well as you think you do."
We have been saying this from day one. In fact, we have been explaining all of Blockstream's plan from day one. No one ever listens to us.
"Good for BCH,

Now there is a simple choice if you support all scaling solutions: **BCH**

If you think only 2 layers should scale and high fees: **BTC**


But I guess we will have to be prepared to a torrent of trolling in the coming months as the full effort will be directed against BCH.."

You do know that what you are calling bcash is totally different to segwit2x, right?
"Bitcoin Cash it is then :)

I give it 48hrs before Bitpay say they will start accepting it."
This is good for Bitcoin (which means Bitcoin Cash)
[deleted]
Tumble? It's still worth > $600. You mean against BTC? That is not a good measurement for someone who doesn't count their assets in terms of BTC... like most Cash supporters.
The disaster was Blockstream appearance, people are cleaning mess slowly and steady. Stifling Bitcoin is the wrong side
What's bcash? 
If that's confirmed, it's time for miners to change the cost multiplier and start charging an increasingly higher fee for SegWit transactions...
So... Are we rolling back segwit now?
Idiots. We all called it 3 months ago.
"It did: http://coin.dance/blocks

even 95% at some point, although down to 80-85% towards the end"
Bitcoin Cash has won. Our small blocker competitors have chosen to choke their own Bitcoin Segwit network to just 1 MB per block. Lol.
seriously? are you kidding me? we are lead by douchbags.. 
this
Wonder if there will be any further discussion from Core about changing Bitcoin's PoW algorithm?
Thank God for the fourth quarter fork on 1 August 17.  Imagine if that didn't happen. 
*Bitcoin (Segwit)
You knew this was all a scam when both didn't activate at the same time.
This is a joke. They had the chance to get rid of core and they back off because of reddit and twitter bots + propaganda. Hilarious. 
"Here's what I see.

All bases are still covered by (pre-Aug1) hodlers: 

- If it is really that investors don't care about current utility and just want to pile into the big ledger, then BTC will be fine despite being really ridiculous about its blocksize cap. 

- If not, it becomes all about Bitcoin Cash. 

- If Bitcoin Cash is vulnerable due to minority hashrate position, miners can still always fork away from Core later (though Segwit remains a lurking concern). 

We have to come to grips with the fact that we can be totally right about Core's utter idiocy and still be very EARLY. That increasingly looks like it may be the case. The classic investing mistake of the great visionaries is to be too early. One must carefully separate out one's near-term investment thesis from one's long-term understanding of what must *eventually* be the case. ""The market can stay irrational longer than you can remain solvent."""
"Well fuck me. I was not expecting this... but its alright. The strangle of Core will just get tighter sooner and people will want to escape it sooner.

**Bitcoin Cash is the real Bitcoin anyway.**"
There is no bitcoin community.
"Lol exactly.  You don't prosper by keeping the criminals in your community in order to ""stay together""."
It's more that if you look at the futures prices, the various organization coming out against it, and the fact that a lot of miners dropped out, it was unlikely that the fork would succeed. The most likely outcome if they tried to push through was that the price of B2X remained low and that more and more miners jumped back to the legacy chain until the Segwit2x chain died completely.
"How sad that the trolling worked and made them give up. What a shit show.

Looks like Bitcoin Cash is the way to go."
Not until Bitcoin Segwit will die or change the PoW. After that community will partially reemerge. Open blockchains will take over the world with massive drama. Even wars are probable
"So how long till the soft fork to 300kb blocks? 

Edit: a letter and changed hard to soft after others pointed out that the blocksize can be decreased with a soft fork. I will admit, what's possible with a 'softfork' vs 'hardfork' in bitcoin confuses me. "
"Very interesting... As a supporter of Segwit2x I got fucked in the ass :(

Bitcoin cash is now the only option."
"It's a good thing bch forked when it did. 

2x was a shitshow, and completely unnececary after cash was introduced.

Now it's time to get eda fixed properly."
"What I don't get is, if bitcoin can't get bigger blocks now with over 80% hashpower agreeing, then when will it? Does this mean bitcoin will have 1MB blocks forever? Lets say one year from now core decides to raise the blocksize limit. Whats to stop the No2x movement from coming back again?

The only reason I've been holding BTC is because I had faith in the 2x movement, Now that 2x is dead, I have no reason to hold my BTC anymore. This is a sad day. At least the price is up so I'll get a good exchange rate when converting to BCH..."
"> BTC has been overtaken by hodlers

you misspelled ""the financial industry"""
"I'm in this ""space"" because I believe in open source. I think all of society's software should be operated by open source software. If the world's finance was ran on completely open source software, the world would be a better place."
"""Although we
strongly believe in the need for a larger blocksize, there is something we
believe is even more important: keeping the community together.""

Lol, 2 years too late for that one!"
"Yet the people who hated 2x for the block size got their Segwit, and the people who hated 2x for Segwit got shit. This isn't scrapping a compromise, it's reneging on one half of the deal when the other side already got what they wanted.

It was no secret to any of us why Segwit was activated first, and the block size increase to come ""at a later date."" It was never going to come at all because Segwit came first and Segwit is impossible to remove. They made a deal one party was able to back out of while the other had no choice but to commit to their side of the ""compromise.""

It's about as underhanded and dirty as it gets."
Sometimes perfect is the worst enemy of good.
Fees for BTC will skyrocket, we are all fucked.
Maybe he brought futures?
"Maybe he trusted for signatories to keep their word that SW2x activates both SegWit and 2MB blocksize limit increase.

Now signatories only activated SegWit and fucked everyone who supported SW simply to get 2 MB. (SegWit alone would have never got activated)."
Give me my bitcoin cash, Coinbase.
"When I heard about S2X my first thought was that it would fail due to the separate segwit & large block activation times.  This is why I never pushed BU to endorse it (but at the same time did not reject it).  Given the terrible state of segwit support in wallets (including bitcoin core's own GUI) its pretty clear that the core strategy is to use segwit to enable offchain technologies, not to use it to directly relieve onchain capacity.

Unfortunately setwit2x and the bitcoin cash fork (and the brief extension block proposal by was it bitpay?) also ended the BU EC+segwit compromise effort which was ongoing at that time.  Its a classic case of divide and conquer.

Its interesting that the miner that first welched out on segwit2x IIRC was f2pool because they were the miner that really stopped the BU effort from moving beyond 45% last summer.  If I remember correctly, they also have huge amounts of altcoin mining hardware...
"
1MB is currently Core's selling point. It's a complete joke
"really? I'm not seeing it, and intuitively I would think the opposite is likely.

Why do you expect that  / where do you see it"
I genuinely don't understand. Shouldn't this be bullish for BCH?
[deleted]
It's actually good for bitcoin cash, not that doesn't prevent anybody from doing their selloff (though cash is up too, just not as much).
I see no such selloff. You seem to be looking at BTC/BCH which dropped due to the BTC price spike.
Maybe the Bitcoin Investment Trust has started selling theirs.
"Before the fork, alot of alt-coin lost value due to consolidation to get free coins. Right now alot of value is flowing back, but it will take time given the 1mb block size.

Keep a steady eye on the unconfirmed transaction / mempool information for now."
This whole market is under control of Tethers you know?
Is it? price seems stable,
Bitcoin Cash has better fundamentals. Price proportion is more or less reflect economic activity proportion and it's a very good sign
Update: BCH price recovered after about four hours.
[deleted]
"Im afraid this will be overlooked but it's a great point. 

It prompts larger questions. Opposition can be funded with money, and/or with EDA machinatia. They have money, we have EDA. The longest chain rule will come down to ""longest chain that's actually used""?

Maybe it's fine to have two bitcoins. After all the 21m number was arbitrary in the first place I believe. the downside for both chains is merely the threat of miner abandonment. 

Is it possible to eliminate this fear (besides the imperfect way of holding both)?

The miners know now how to keep both Golden geese alive, but that's not the same as knowing that they will.

The only way for BCH to be confident that it will be kept alive is to make things happen, build, cause transactions.

The only way for BTC to be confident it will be kept alive is... Keep making people believe it's more valuable than BCH. That's it.

How can it? Censorship & lies. So far so good. But censoring faster than the crumble will become impossible."
"Yeah, and they don't seem to realise that pushing people to altcoins is not in any way ""keeping the community together""."
BItcoin (cash) is doing fine.
[deleted]
Ah, im up since yesterday bch. No selloff on Kraken
But... It does. 
No, they don't
"Just as predicted when the NYA was proposed: they'd get segwit and we'd never, ever, get larger blocks.

Thank Satoshi for Bitcoin Cash!"

*by Blockstream. Hodlers don't mess with the narrative and allowed to speak
This is why the price is rising, no one can get out of BTC xD
"https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#2h

Currently 22 BTC in fees waiting to be confirmed. Still extremely high."
"""way too high"" is totally dependent on the status of the network though which is how this whole issue got started. As fees started rising people's txns weren't confirming so wallet devs increased the fees.

The problem is that you shouldn't have to guess at what to pay to get your transaction confirmed in a reasonable amount of tie. "
Put your astronaut suit on. 
Dominant contender to the Bitcoin name. Expect higher prices to finish the year
It means that someone will focus their attack on BCH instead of SW2x now.
$100,000/BCH in 2021.
It means its the real bitcoin.
Thanks a lot :)
Thanks, man
"The BCH pump was not about trading swings. It was well informed, wealthy, people (probably asian miners), buying up cheap BCH for the long haul. 

The initial reaction does not affect the insiders who bought a shitload fo 300-400$ BCH. If BCH hadn't pumped by close to 100% over the past few weeks it would be in the green by 20-30% or more like many alts today after the news. They bought for the long term, not a trading position. The people who want to scale Bitcoin on the 2x side that knew or had a feeling started buying up very cheap BCH weeks ago. Today's charts mean nothing. The on chain scalers only have one chain called bitcoin they can scale and that is BCH. It is better for them and us, because competition in this free market will benefit all"
As someone who has a (very very small) amount of BTC and ETH hanging around, and only occasionally pops by here, what's the preferred client or service nowadays?

"trash alright..  SW was able to remove yet **another** useful feature from Bitcoin, signing of messages

looks like all in on [Bitcoin Cash](https://learnbitcoin.cash) for big blockers.
Wait, how does that make any sense at all? How would you seize this terrorist's money from a Segwit address?
"> Trezor is already forcing its users onto Segwit addresses

False.  You can create a non-segwit address anytime you want.  I use both segwit and non segwit on my Trezor regularly.

> Now that we have segwit addresses all it will take is to identify a terrorist or some other bad guy with money that needs to be seized. 

100% false.  There is no way to seize a segwit address.  if you believe that's true, then take some.  Go pick any segwit address out there and seize it.

The fact that you actually believe this proves how well Roger's lies have worked on ignorant users.  It's a real shame."
It's spelled 'Ethereum'.
"> Miners enforce the rules, they don't make them

Wrong. Without miners' support Bitcoin ABC couldn't fly. And now it has 1/10 of economic activity going on. Nakamoto consensus!"
"> Miners enforce the rules, they don't make them.

They can choose which software they run, so they do kind of make the rules. Why do you think segwit was delayed for so long? It was because the miners didn't adopt the version that included segwit, therefore no users could use segwit until miners switched. It was the miners eventually switching that lead to segwit going live."
"> Because it really may go to $100,000

Not if it has 1MB blocks forever. The only reason it has 100K potential is because it may be used as a global currency. At 1MB blocks it has no potential for global adoption. The only reason I held through all the ""it can only do 3tps"" criticism is because I thought it could hardfork at some time in the future to get more capacity. Now that I know it can't ever hard fork, then it's time to move my money to a new currency that *can* hard fork."
"> it just needs to be really thought through, with plenty of time for planning, testing and upgrading etc.

If you ask a No2xer to explain why he or she thinks 2x was not tested enough or not thought through enough, you won't get any response from them. Jimmy Song straight up asked Lombozo on his youtube channel ""what exactly goes into a safe hardfork that you can back"", and his answer was basically ""I don't know"""
[deleted]
"The miners are who executes the decision, not the devs, so it's odd for this to be coming from the dev mailing list. Sure, it looks like Jihan pulled out, but that shouldn't detract from the point. This should be a miner announcement, not a dev announcement, and the reasoning should have been investor and infrastructural sentiment.

>Unfortunately, it is clear that we have not built sufficient consensus for a clean blocksize upgrade at this time.

And this was determined how? Twitter polls? Improperly done ""futures"" contracts on low volume? Censored subreddit sentiment? 

If it is just general community pressure, tweets, etc., how are they ever going to get up the nerve to make a move? Either futures contracts will have to be done properly, or BCH is it. The other possibility is that eventually BTC fees get to $50 or so, Core remains intransigent, and the next fork has a lot more ""consensus"" <facepalm> for it."
"> Propose a safe implementation and more people will support it then you think.

No one can define what is ""safe"". There will always be people that scream ""its not safe"" no matter what. Not a single core developer have spoken on what goes into a safe hard fork. They just repeat ""its not safe... it's not safe... it's not safe"" over and over again."
/u/MemoryDealers, does this mean the bitcoin.com mining pool will [shift](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/750z6m/bitcoin_dot_com_will_move_to_bcash_if_2x_fails/do2mjyt/?context=3) all it's mining resources to Bitcoin Cash since S2X failed? 
"I called it... https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7alpqk/why_the_price_of_bitcoin_cash_is_rising_and_what/

That is why BCH pumped, insiders knew."
Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin now. Deal with it. 
Ha ha!!
So who the hell decides these things??  Sad that bitcoin is now an insider oligarchy.  Whoever knew about this beforehand is rich.
Bitcoin Cash is 3 month old and already has 1/10 of economic activity and parallel DARIs with Bitcoin Segwit. U're too pessimistic
"Actually if you look at the markets, the money went to NEO, IOTA, Waves, Lisk, Ark, OmniseGO,  Walton, ChainLink.

BCH is actually down.

"
Bitcoin Cash > Ethereum from sound money perspective
"The problems in Ethereum are only with the smart contracts, and even then only some of them, because the tools to debug and formally verify these contracts are being developed, but don't exist yet.  

But for money transfers from one account to another, like Bitcoin is used for, Ethereum is safe and has never had a problem."
"No more agreements. Hong Kong failed, NYA failed. This doesn't work.

Hashpower and brute force are the only way to 'vote' in Bitcoin. What's next? Core changing the POW? What will you spineless cowards do then?

I'm mostly disappointed that Bitcoin's exchange rate value probably had a lot to do with this decision. The exchange rate shouldn't matter, fiat shouldn't matter. In the future, it won't."
Bitcoin Segwit has no chance long-term
Community isn't together. Small blockers and big blockers are still fighting
Less contentious than 2mb? 1.5?
The whole thing was contingent on the 2x fork happening. The bet is off if the upgrade doesn't happen.
people leave bch for btc, pretty obv if you ask me
"Yeah...I think the more likely explanation is 1. Institutional money coming in to pump price up to bribe miners to stay on BTC and not move to BCH and 2. The fake tethers being created, it was adequately demonstrated that there was a correlation with a correlation coefficient of .9655. 

Your thoughts, master troll? "
Price discussion deserve a separate thread. Market is dealing with much more information than any player can comprehend in any given moment. Short-term oftenly means nothing
"> as to why this fork didn't happen yet

Hard-coded block number isn't achieved yet"
"That was kneejerk ""the community is unified"" investor speculation.  i.e. buy on good news.

Now we see the exit back to altcoins as Bitcoin drops."
Just curious, what color is the sky in your world?
"$7200 as of now?

Wasn’t the ATH higher?"
[deleted]
"I think today might be the top.  We'll get an initial move higher on the surprise, followed by an ugly sell off as a ""sell the news"" event.  There is really no reason to hold BTC now.  Price has moved up over 3 waves this year (which is a typical complete bull move)...   all the fork hopes are gone...   what reason does anyone have to buy now?"
Try to get? Bitcoin Cash is topping at liquidity right now
They're silent about the reason - Bitcoin Cash. It's a bad, but understandable move
Price is spiking right now, passing $7800 as I type this.  Can't be coincidence, right?
"Great news indeed! 

Quite some price jump :)

Segwit2x futures aren't doing so well right now :)"
The fittest algo will win. Seems like DAA will take over without a fight
"So 85% of us want something and to prevent ""controversy"" we will do what the vocal 15% want?"
Fight is far from over
it always has been
You must be new.  It's been like this since a bit before the BCH fork.   They hate BTC around here.
All in on BCH.
"Holy shit! 
Bitcoin Cash to the moon!"
"Clear differentiation betwen BTC being small block believers in eventual layer 2 solutions, fee market, and primary use as a store of value.  

vs. 

BCH as peer to peer electronic cash, scaling on chain, focusing on everyday use.  "
I have to admit: apparently I was wrong about SegWit2x being a good idea. I hugely underestimated to power of core's propaganda/censorship machine and largely overestimated the backbone of the people signing the NYA. Also I never imagined how many big blockers would side with the devil, i.e. actually support core with all its censorship, propaganda, etc, just because they think Bitcoin Cash would profit. Not sure if they will profit from SW2x downfall, though. What do you think the propaganda machine will attack next? In my opinion today showed that the reasonable people in Bitcoin have ultimately lost.
"Nothing is likely to happen instantly. But 85% of the miners, the people who secure the network, wanted bigger blocks.  The compromise of 2x was supposed to do that... but only one side was given what they wanted... the small blockers got their Segwit... but the miners who wanted larger blocks got screwed.

Now... they have Bitcoin Cash to point their hashrate at and to support. It would be smartest for them to make it a gradual shift so Bitcoin doesn't tank and pull everyone else down. Bitcoin Cash needs to build recognition and substantially marketcap before Bitcoin Segwit can be overthrown."
"The real value proposition was to get rid of core/Blockstream, and give Bitcoin the chance to grow.

Not it has no chance. Mempool is stuffed, fees are high. It's a settlement network, not a currency."
">I'm sad

 I am a bot. use !unsubscribetosadcat for me to ignore you."
Bitcoin is the open protocol with two competing chains currently. Never forget that
If verified, and I'm stuck in traffic- whoa.  Simply whoa.  This will be a historic day indeed. 
"> the community coming together

No, it doesn't. Bitcoin Segwit and Bitcoin Cash mathematically can't coexist. Nash theorem. It means more spitting from the wrong side of history until split is resolved"
Oh, I guess we'll have to cancel segwit too.  It was only activated because of the NYA in the first place.
"Good news for Bitcoin Cash supporters.   
**Why?**   
Because who would BCH rather compete or co-exist with over time; Segwit1x or Segwit2x?   
2x was stronger. 1x is slower and less agile. It doesn't move or adapt well, because Core out-coached themselves and over-developed it. Core saddled its block-spine with controversial tech. Now, BTC can act as a settlement layer and store of value, but can't transact well.^1 Cash can do both. It can both store value (like gold) and exchange it (like cash).  
**Cash's competition is now locked to Core's technology and developers.**    
The fork could have also crashed the markets, and Core, like Gox Mountain, could have taken confidence and the crypto market down with it for a protracted period, which would have debilitated the critical momentum crypto has in its bigger battle against the banks. *If Cash has the better tech*, then a stable market favors it over-time.  Cash can embrace Core's defectors and methodically capture its market share as Core bleeds out and freezes off-chain.  Let them compete in the open market, and if BTC survives, which I suspect it still will, then we won't have two similar coins.  BTC can specialize as a store-of-value.  Yes, many wanted to defeat the Troll Army and save bitcoin from the Core kidnappers on 16 November 2017 at Block 494784, but this could have been a short-term victory for a long-term defeat.   
It's like the **Cold War**. The US and USSR could have nuked each other immediately, and the US may have survived, half-annihilated.  Instead, the US let the USSR spend themselves to death over-time in an arms race they couldn't win, because Communism produced inferior products and sowed dissent.    
**^1** Bitcoin is valuable because it has utility.  It has utility because it does things.  It does two things particularly well; it stores value and transacts it. Core intentionally limited bitcoin's ability to transact value, ostensibly to maintain decentralization and improve security. It did this by restricting the blocksize and developing bitcoin to process transactions off-chain. Blockstream, incidentally, owns patents to some of these sidechains. It openly plans to [profit](https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/923309367260274688) from them, and [reportedly](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6o2744/how_many_bitcoin_developers_are_employed_by/) pays many of Core's developers. Core's developers thus restricted bitcoin's utility as a medium of exchange, which also profits a business that pays them.  "
oh -13 downvote-s ?
Holy shit. Was not expecting to see this. So Blockstream have won... segwit with no block size increase. What a fucking world we are in. Disgusting.
Yes because FOMO is such a predictable and rational thing.
I actually love that this happened, if segwit2x happened it would divide communites which could damage bitcoin as a whole. Now we have BCH and BTC and i prefer it this way
I pity you.
Noone knows about that, we'll all find out the day of the fork
They could, but all of them would need to do it otherwise the transactions would just be delayed longer.
You do realize everyone here know your a paid troll.
Correct. Miners have a final say. They can run btc1 or... Bitcoin ABC

Why must you be so offensive in your disagreements?
I don't think most people know of him or care about him at all. 
The statement was referencing a future possibility with no timeline attached.  That scenario played out today. Let's see how committed he is.
You're probably right, but we're going to have fun with this statement nonetheless.

Well all his pre-fork Bitcoin are on the BCH chain as well.
It is an old statement.
This was quite a while ago, just before they offered Bitcoin Cash mining, IIRC.
It (hopefully) doesn't. I just answered his question! 
It's from 3 months ago... and the statement was made exactly for this occasion.
"99% sure, but I'm writing it from memory. That's what the wording would imply — ""[..] Pool will give mining customers the option of supporting the Bitcoin Cash chain [..]"" — note the ""will"" not ""is now supporting"" or similar."
Shhhh let them think w/e they like as long as they support BCH as a medium of exchange

Because its the only way to get it through thick skulls
Yeah I agree. And I'm not a Ver fan by any means.
We all know it will turn out to him being full of shit.
Im happy with whatever decision they/he makes. Id prefer a company like his gradually guide their users to BCH than make a rash decisions and lose customers thus becoming less relevant. 
Don't hodl your breath. He'll probably come up with a convoluted and idiotic reason why this statement does not apply anymore, when the real reason is much simpler: he speaks before he thinks.
"How is it sound business to mine at a loss?

Then you don't know Roger Ver well. He always does what is profitable, not what he promised.

There is no date. Is it an old statement or do they right now still hope that miners will fork?
If Roger is promoting bch so heavily he should be materially invested in it. Publicly announcing a 4m bch bet is not really betting on bch when the significant majority of your assets are in segwit1x
Don't hold your breath.
Honestly Roger Ver was one of the lead supporters of NYA and giving Core team SegWit with no blocksize increase.  He has definitely not correct judgement in all cases.  Probably unlikely he will follow through with this statement.
While he's at it. he's also swapping his own btc for bch
Switch all the mining hashrate to BCH after the hardfork.
Yes I do.
Yes, because he’s right
Yes. And I know he will. Go back to your Litecoin subs.

Ugh how does restricting blocksize wind up being against the free market of miners. How is saying that one chain should be handled one way and an other chain an other way against the free market? That sounds like an embracement of it. Miners are free to mine what ever they want, the market can value any chain as it so chooses and people are free to use what chain they want.
By restricting the blocksize you are restricting the amount of transactions miners are allowed to fit in a block. That is no different than regulating the output of miners. Again - this is complicated and is more economical than technical. I promise I'll tag you when I finish my write up on the subject

Oh I am a shill alright. For Satoshi's vision of decentralized peer to peer cash.

"If you believe in the white paper then you probably aren't a bitcoin core supporter. And if you're a core supporter you probably don't believe in 2 MB blocks.

The funny thing is that this joke would have been laughed at by core supporters only a few months ago. But the narratives changed so much that if you post this now you'd probably be banned for supporting ""shitcoins""."
Wright brothers envisioned that for the plane to work it needs to be pulled by its engine and the engine can be replaced with more powerful one as needed. They wrote all of that in their whitepaper. 
They believe Lightning Network is the key to scaling whereas Satoshi believed there would be bigger and bigger blocks as technology improved.
"If I could give you more than one upvote for this, I would. None of us had a direct psychic connection to Satoshi's thoughts while he composed the white paper. There's simply no way any individual can know that their understanding of ""Satoshi's Vision"" is the ""correct"" one."
I'd say it did a good job of laying out how to scale in a plain and easy to interpret way.
"And you can actually spend it for less than 70¢ in fees!

Throw it in to Yours.org and curate great content. :)"
"You're confused. 

Miners can choose to impose additional rules at any time. For example, they can:

1. Disallow blocks bigger than 0.5 MB.
2. Disallow transactions involved certain addresses.

This is what is called ""soft fork"". It can be enforced by miners, they do not need consent of users. (E.g if miners only create blocks smaller than 0.5 MB you cannot do anything. You can still accept 1 MB blocks, but they do not come. You cannot force miners to create blocks >0.5 MB.)

On the other hand, if you allow things which were not allowed (e.g. 100 BTC reward, 10 MB blocks), that's a hard fork.

Thus:

1. miners can do soft forks without user consent
2. miners cannot do hard forks without user consent"
">  and cannot fit any more transactions.

The more segwit txs in a block, the more txs fit in a block.  These blocks only have a few segwit txs.  As more services adopt segwit, these blocks will continually get larger.  We've seen plenty of 1.1mb, 1.2mb and even an 1.6mb block with segwit.

Additionally, the ""txs per block"" metric is pretty meaningless.  I can make one single tx that pays 4 different people, or I can make 4 separate txs that each pay one of those 4 same people.  Why are 4 txs better than 1 in this scenario if they represent the exact same economic activity?  ""Outputs per block"" is a more meaningful metric."
Thank you for your insight.
I know you would like that to be true, but reality doesn't work that way. Thats why you BCH'ers are all mad.
You don't get to add jet engines to a plane and still call it a plane. The Wright Brothers didn't envision that!

"When you add jet engines to a plane, you call it a 'jet plane'. Then when people ask, 'Is a jet plane still an aeroplane?' you say, 'Yes.'

The fact is the people in charge of the original repository can do whatever they want with it, and call the result whatever they want. Nobody can really stop them, but people can opt out and fork the code, in which case the people in charge of the *new* repository can do whatever they want with *that* and call *that* result whatever they want.

Agreed also. Due to those qualities it can't be controlled by governments or corporations.

>Convenience is also important. Low fees and being able to buy a coffee with it is a ""nice to have"".

I disagree slightly here. I think that low fees are very important as it lets wider demography access Bitcoin. These people, businesses and their various use cases form the market, which is an important part of keeping Bitcoin decentralized.

If we had wide economy instead of current, narrow one, largely limited to price speculation, then Bitcoin would be less centralized. As it stands it's basically few centralized exchanges (by what they list and omit, what tickers they use, what agreements they sign) and miners who are calling the shots on Bitcoin's future.

Let me help: (emphasis on the bold part)

>Whitepaper is a description of the fundamental nature of Bitcoin, so yes it is **flawless in describing that vision.**

As you see, I'm not putting anyone on pedestal. I simply remarked, - bit tongue in cheek - that Satoshi's whitepaper is the most flawless description of his vision by definition. (Who other than Satoshi could describe his very own vision better? Someone with telepathic powers maybe?) 

Ofcourse someone else might have better ideas. If those ideas are in conflict with Satoshi's vision/Bitcoin whitepaper, maybe that someone should write his own whitepaper and launch his own coin.

As Bitcoin is permissionless that is ofcourse not a must. He can persuade the community (using censorship or whatever means) that Satoshi's experiment should be cancelled and the name Bitcoin should be given to his new idea instead."
"You do need a philosophy but I prefer to have my own rather than blindly someone else's.

For me bitcoin is a means of storing value and transmitting it. The most important properties of Bitcoin are security, permissionlessness, censorship resistance and not being controlled by governments and corporations. Convenience is also important. Low fees and being able to buy a coffee with it is a ""nice to have""."

"**Straw man**

A straw man is a common form of argument and is an informal fallacy based on giving the impression of refuting an opponent's argument, while refuting an argument that was not presented by that opponent. One who engages in this fallacy is said to be ""attacking a straw man"".

The typical straw man argument creates the illusion of having completely refuted or defeated an opponent's proposition through the covert replacement of it with a different proposition (i.e., ""stand up a straw man"") and the subsequent refutation of that false argument (""knock down a straw man"") instead of the opponent's proposition.

This technique has been used throughout history in polemical debate, particularly in arguments about highly charged emotional issues where a fiery ""battle"" and the defeat of an ""enemy"" may be more valued than critical thinking or an understanding of both sides of the issue.

Some of these people have even said publicly that it will never work years ago, around the time they joined Core. If they think they can do better they should have made their own coin, and left Bitcoin the hell alone."
"> Satoshi is perfect. 

POW!

> He never made a mistake and his white paper is flawless. 

POW!

POW!"
Nice [straw man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man) argument.
"Whitepaper is a description of the fundamental nature of Bitcoin, so yes it is flawless in describing that vision.

If someone has an idea of a better system, they should make their own whitepaper and release their own coin (or fork) and not railroad Bitcoin into being something it was never supposed to be."
Bitcoin is not a philosophy or a dogma. It's a living, developing, evolving system. It's bigger than you or I or anyone. It's bigger than the whitepaper. It's bigger than Satoshi. It's adaptive, it's open, it's distributed, it's symmetric, it's censorship resistant, it's antifragile. It feeds on new ideas. It thrives on challenges. Every time it is tested it gets stronger. That is the thing I believe in and invest in. The real living thing, not some idea of it preserved in aspic.
SegWit and Lightning are more powerful engines.
And Satoshi was right about everything because...?
I just made a yours accounts a week ago. 
"“Satoshi is perfect. *He never made a mistake* and his white paper is *flawless*. We should interpret this document until the end of time to realize His vision and allow bitcoin to finally compete with PayPal and Apple Pay.

Satoshi left bitcoin simply because he was a coward afraid of the CIA and we all would be better off if he came back to guide us, as the crowd is stupid and we need a single leader.

In fact, Satoshi already has come back. He’s Craig Wright and we should *trust* that he’s Satoshi even though he can’t move any of Satoshi’s coins for some reason.”

">It's adaptive, it's open, it's distributed, it's symmetric, it's censorship resistant, it's antifragile.

You list qualities of a system, but you fail to say **what it is** or **what it is supposed to be**.

Is it an electronic cash system secured by PoW? Is it only a settlement layer for former? Is it neither of those, just some random evolving thing that could end up being whatever? (A tool for sharing lolcats, maybe?) One needs a philosophy in order to work towards some goal. The Whitepaper is that philosophy. It answers to a question: *what* is Bitcoin.

"I just like to talk about ideas. But it's boring to talk with arrogant people who are so sure of everything that their minds are closed.

""The whole problem with the world is that fools and fanatics are always so certain of themselves, and wiser people so full of doubts."" "
NO in here, it's the Whitepaper, Satoshi's Vision. Not long until someone makes Satoshi's Witnesses and start going door to door with little flyers about how Satoshi will come back and save us from the evil Core and banksters and such
Stop trying to fit everyone in such dumb categories. 
The story is about people like you taking this whole thing too seriously.
Oh come on, this is funny no matter what you believe of the fork.
Good. I laughed. Could have shortened down a bit. Glad to remember this guy's name! My old professor loved him and I've been trying to find him.
Cool story, bro, but DCG Consensus Agreement of 2017 is a hard fork.
"That is funny.

Its funny but be careful with the title. People are very sensitive if things go badly, its better not to mention what they may do during negative events.

"LOL, very nice :D

EDIT: I wonder whether it should be DCG agreement or NYA."
"I literally LOLed.  
Thanks."
This is actually funny no matter what little patch of the bitcoin spectrum you're aggressively protecting.
Found at /r/Buttcoin, made me laugh! I am a christian and the original one (about denominations) is also funny. Funny cause true. 
"I've never read such a long joke, word by word. Agreed with, then laughed out loud. 

However, I hodl all Bitcoin forks. I even hold shitcoins, but I buy more Bitcoin Cash, and will get 80% Bitcoin Cash, rest in shitcoins. "
100 bit u/tippr
the original idea became popular because people like us wanted to return power from expansive governments to the people (as well as ending the cycle of poverty that is caused by remittance fees from systems like Western Union). the idea of the white paper is more than just a few pages of how the code will work :)
"A white paper is not something you have to ""believe in"". It's just a technical description of an idea.

You write like it's a religious document.

p.s. I'm in favour of core and I LOLd at this. Because I have a sense of humour."
As an open minded person, you're the one that seems closed minded here. The only way we can learn is through debate and others challenging our views. I don't see where your argument is.
"The irony of me getting 6 cent by reposting something that was made by a /r/buttcoin guy (it was a adaptation of a joke by Emo Philips)

"> It's just a technical description of an idea.

Wrong."
">A white paper is not something you have to ""believe in"". It's just a technical description of an idea.

>You write like it's a religious document.

Well Bitcoin is still an ongoing experiment.

The correct sentence might have been if “you believe the tech characteristics described in the white paper will lead to a long term ,sustainable and secure currency”.

But there is still a level of “belief” lots of unknown ahead.

For example no cryptocurrencies have proven being able to remain secure **and** inflation free.

I believe it can only be achieved via large block, typically small blocker believe it can only be achieved by small block to force high fees.

“Beliefs”"
"The original joke this is based on religion.

"It's a description of the fundamental workings of P2P electronic cash system called Bitcoin. The theory that is supposed to make it tick.

If someone thinks that they have a better theory, for example one where the a blockchain simply works as a settlenment layer, they should make a spinoff or an altcoin.

Thats the only way for everyone to be sure what they buy into."
You don't have to agree with the whitepaper, you can create your altcoin with what you agree. Core don't agree with the whitepaper, excluded those who agreed calling them altcoinesr.
">[A **white paper** is an **authoritative report** or guide that **informs** readers **concisely about a complex issue** and presents **the issuing body's philosophy** on the matter. It is **meant to help** readers **understand an issue**, **solve a problem**, **or make a decision.**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_paper)

I seems like you're thinking about a ""green paper""

>a **green paper** is a **tentative** government report and **consultation document** of **policy proposals for debate and discussion.**

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_paper"
"I'd say you're half-right.

The Bitcoin whitepaper does technically describe an idea. It's up to people who believe that the idea can work to make it a reality.

Strangely, Core is filled with people who don't believe that Bitcoin can work as described.
"
"> And if you're a core supporter you probably don't believe in 2 MB blocks.

What is ""2 MB blocks""?

SegWit allows blocks up to 4 MB in size, but most likely in practice they will be limited to 2 MB. E.g. recently 1.6 MB block was mined. So we already have ~2 MB blocks on Core.

NYA agreement is about increasing max weight to 8 MB, so blocks up to 8 MB are possible.

Also joke is not accurate, both Hong Kong agreement and NYA are about **hard forks**."
The name is Emo Phillips if other people care.
Spellin' humor with a U?! DIE SHITSPEAKER!!
"> Cool story, bro, but DCG Consensus Agreement of 2017 is a hard fork.

But then you should be cheerful, as it gives you more control as a user who presumably wants to ""stay on 1x""?"
The idea is that bitcoin have soo much in commun, it's soo ridiculous we are in war for stupid parameters. Yet I think the war was both inevitable and necessary.

It's a joke bro and I did not make it. Somebody on /r/buttcoin did. 
"Actually, that joke is a parody of a Calvinist religious joke I once heard in a church sermon. Since Bitcoin is not a religion, the correct term is ""cult"" and all cults go through multiple civil wars. On the bright side, BTC = $7500 largely because it's underpinned by a rabid, global technology cult."

I see that Roger has many nicknames.
I wholeheartedly agree the value is in the moneyness and hence **the** ledger but are you saying that millions of tx per second can **not** be reached securely neither with POW nor POS ?
