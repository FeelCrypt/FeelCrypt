"el chapo has killed hundreds if not thousands of people. he’s killed gov officials, judges etc. its obvious you don’t understand the entire situation of what he did compared to anyone else. 

el chapo sells billions of dollars worth of cocaine using terror to keep power with a huge gang. ross did literally the opposite of that. drugs are going to be sold no matter what. "
hey pal, you just blow in from stupid town
"i understand his position though, he was able to hide in plain site bc he didnt think he could be traced. he fucked up before the silk road was even started bc he used his name on an email account 

he was also a pretty “normal” guy. but yes its dumb for not leaving, but every criminal fees invincible. i also understand not wanting to leave people you’re close w etc"
"That is where he was caught. Let me ask you this, if you were him, would you reside in the good ol' USA, while running the biggest dark web site? Because if you do you are a farking moron, just like he was....

Not to mention he lost his customers' money too...."
