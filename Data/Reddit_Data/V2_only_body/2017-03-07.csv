Because the fee required to transfer 5 dimes is 6 dimes, they are uneconomical to spend.
"Yeah wouldn't it be funny if Bitcoin's replacement already existed
Edit: I don't own dash I'm just not optimistic about btc atm, staying vigilant "
Transaction volume will remain at max. If transaction volume were lower, then there would be more room for lower fee transactions.
Can you explain? 
no R8?
You're not supposed to actually use it. That's just spamming. /s
"Why? It wouldn't reduce fees or congestion in any meaningful way.

"
"you don't know what instability means do you?

as to why it's bad for pricing, when someone has to convert more or less, and prices change second by second - a currency becomes much less user friendly. it is an investment vehicle (With a fiat value interestingly) rather than a currency. 

Yes, you can spend bitcoin - but what volume of transactions are investment and economic manipulation v. actual purchases, and real currency style transactions?"
"Bitcoin is money. There can't be qualifiers on how much can be sent. 

Even if I send someone $5 worth, it still doesn't make sense for them (or me) to pay $1 in fees. "
"> I'm not sure you understand how fees work in bitcoin.

I guess I don't, fully.  I thought the fees were capped at either ""normal"" or ""priority"", or associated with just the amount being spent at time of transaction.  I was not aware the fees are calculated based on previous number of deposits/amounts to the spending wallet.  Assuming I understood your breakdown.

I would be confused if the grocery store didn't accept 5 dimes for a $0.50 piece of gum.  I'm not sure how that applies to BTC fees, though.  In the example, why wouldn't the store accept 5 dimes?"
"I'm not sure you understand how fees work in bitcoin. They are charged per byte in the transaction. If you transaction has a lot of inputs because you are spending from an address which has received lots of small transactions, you will have to pay a lot because the resulting transaction will be large.

So if someone had had a donations address setup for the last 4 years, which has 1,000 1mbtc inputs (1BTC total) because 1,000 people have sent a dollar to it, to spend that the transaction needs to have 1,000 inputs and would be very large, and hence very expensive.

It would be like your gum-ball machine saying 'You cant use 5x 10c coins, you have to use 1x50c coin'. Which isn't too bad given a gumball machine is fairly limited, but if you want to a supermarket checkout with your 5x10c coind to pay for a 50x gumball and they didn't accept them, you'd be a bit confused."
"> I appreciate your info, here. If there is no technical reason for the limitation to make small purchases, then what happened? why are the fees high? Isn't it a reflection of the market's acceptance of such a workflow?

No, it's a reflection of many valuable people to be fed up with some negative aspects of bitcoin ecosystem which led gregg max to hijack bitcoin and artificially cripple it. Had the market spoken naturally, free from this sabotage, bitcoin would be much bigger than what it is now.

> I'm in favor of increasing block size, if that's the best solution. I'm also OK with BTC working as it has currently evolved to.

Of course it's the no-brainer solution. In fact, the limit was put as a provisory measure and meant to be lifted soon.
"
"Have there not always been qualifiers (fees) to spending BTC?  So, what's the reasonable amount to charge, and who gets to set that?

On the bigger perspective, what's your suggestion to solve the high fee issue?"
"I am one of them. I have about 0.5BTC sitting in an address which consists of payouts of similar value or smaller to that.

This because I was mining on p2pool because I liked the idea of decentralization. Decentralization is important, right? This is a big ""screw you"" to smaller miners."
"> you don't know what instability means do you?

.

>I don't understand when you say: ""inherent instability"".

I get the definition, but wasn't clear on your context, and I even said so before your condescending followup question, genius.  I assumed you were referring to volatility.

In any case.  Keep up the good work!



"
They are rentier class elite looking to control Bitcoin and ensure it remains only for wealthy nations to keep wealth from accumulating in 3rd world countries. 
"I appreciate your info, here.  If there is no technical reason for the limitation to make small purchases, then what happened?  why are the fees high?  Isn't it a reflection of the market's acceptance of such a workflow?

I get your point about artificial limits.  Is that the causation for the higher fees?  i.e. limits cause congestion, higher fees get you to the front of the congestion.  No congestion = no need for higher fees?

I'm in favor of increasing block size, if that's the best solution.  I'm also OK with BTC working as it has currently evolved to. 

>Would you think it's fine if your country's government removes all coins and bills worth less than 50 usd and just tell you to find some other system?

No.  But BTC is not the established, primary currency, where doing so would be a major disruption.  But then again, if I understood correctly, for BTC to become the primary currency, we need reasonable fees?"
Yeah if only segwit would activate already :/
If you want to buy a $0.75 piece of candy, you don't go to the bank and buy a money order for it, do you?  But are you mad at the banks for this?  So why be mad at BTC for this?  It's not a loose change spending platform.
">  X addresses have between 0.00001-0.001 BTC

7108919 addresses have between 0.00001-0.001 BTC  (1615 BTC)"
A *signed* input is a little more than 113 bytes, closer to 200-220 bytes.  For example, a 1 input 2 output transaction is 226 bytes, while 2 inputs and 2 outputs is 437 bytes.
"> That is some useful data. But, I personally think that even 1 satoshi should be spendable.

Agree. It'd also be good for the utxo (and thus all pruning nodes). Maybe we should come up with a weighting scheme, so that the cost of spending inputs is cheaper/free. "
You understand that bitcoin requires devs (115~ atm working on the open source code) for it to be secure right..?
I will worry about the sky falling AFTER the sky has fallen.  Right now, I'm loving BTC and don't mind the fees/confirmation times.
I think long term, the 32MB limit needs to be lifted too.
I never spend change in the dryer, though.  Or, at least, I don't consider it part of my daily/annual budget.  Point being, this issue is solved with proper advanced planning, or by adding more down the road.
an effective ~130% increase in blocksize, and setting up for lightning network won't reduce congestion or fees in a meaningful way? Okay buddy.
"We were discussing people holding/spending BTC, not a dollar kiosk business model.  

It's simple, if I don't have enough money to store it in a particular system, I don't get mad at the system, I save up more money or choose another system.  BTC is not ready to be used for under $1.00 purchases.  So, buy $20 worth of $1.00 items, instead, or go get your loose change from the couch and buy it that way.  Just like we use several different forms of payment, now.  Do you ONLY use 1 form of currency?  Nope.  So why get all mad at BTC for not working across all use cases?

It seems like you're upset with BTC not being able to be spent for $1.00 purchases.  So work around that, it's easy, and enjoy the majority of good benefits that DO come with BTC."
"Hell yeah, such graph will be very useful.

Showing people when it time to consolidate.

At ~$5 a tx fee we will start to see major loss from uneconomical outputs, I am sure."
"> How high are fees?

If a block was found right this second, a transaction would need about 120 satoshis of fees to be included in it. For a normal transaction, that's like 50 cents or something.

> How are fees set/why are they so high?

Politics and ego shit. There's currently deadlock on how to proceed, so nothing happens. There's several good ways forward, but it's not obvious what's going to happen at this stage

> What can be done about this? Will the problem be resolved?

No one really knows yet. My guess is there will be some backroom talks between the two main camps (Bitcoin Core and the Miners) and will agree upon a compromise solution and go forward. Or at least, such is my hope"
This subreddit is about Bitcoin. If you want to talk about gold, you should probably head to /r/gold
"> The harm is that some people have lots of loose change?

Um, so if it's ""lot's"" it should be enough to spend+fee.  If it's a lot but still under the fee level, it's not ""a lot"".

>So when fees are so high that spending coins held in more than 50% of the available address is a bit odd, don't you think?

No.  If I don't have $0.50 to buy gum from the gumball machine, I don't get mad at how expensive the gum is.  I save more money then spend it.

0.9 fee for a 1.0 balance?  Am I reading this incorrectly?  That's not happening today and it's crazy unrealistic to assume it would get that high.  To answer your question, though, no, it's not ideal."
How much of this is addresses with 0?
Too much FUD here. back to the real bitcoin sub
"Here's how I got to 113 for a standard P2PHK input:

\- Previous txout id: 32 B

\- Previous txout index: 4 B

\- ScriptSig length: 1 B (for script lengths below 254)

\- Signature: 34 B

\- Pubkey: 38 B

\- Sequence number: 4 B

Not sure about the signature/pubkey sizes - I grabbed them from the [example here](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Transaction#Principle_example_of_a_Bitcoin_transaction_with_1_input_and_1_output_only). Perhaps the signature wasn't for a P2PKH input?

Now that you mention it, it seems a bit low, given that a P2PKH output should be... uh... 24 B and the other tx metadata (version, counters and lock-time) is... 10 B?

But then again, 200-220 B, which you're saying, seems too much if to outputs and tx metadata only adds 6-26 B..."
"I'm fine with Fiat AND Bitcoin sharing users.  

I don't understand when you say: ""inherent instability"".  Seems relatively stable (as BTC continues hardening against external influence), to me.  And if/when there's a flux, I buy more.  It's worked for me over the last couple years."
BTC is already legit!  Do you mean as a stable currency?  I get your point, especially with the past volatility spikes, but that's being smoothed out with each passing month.  It looks like it's trending to more stability looking forward.
It would cost more than it is worth to transport $1 gold from vault to vault. So much FUD here i wanna spew. What a dirty community. I'll be heading back to r/bitcoin, this noise stinks

The most secure blockchain will be the one offering the most revenue for miners. Forcing miners to pay 200 bucks to cash in their coinbase (mining pool -> miner -> exchange) isn't a good way to attract miners. It is possible bitcoin can remain a secure but relatively weakly-powered chain in a high-fee equilibrium.
Yea I have quite a few addresses that I'd prefer to consolidate - but can't do that without taking a loss. I don't really want to be a burden on the UTXO set, but what choice do I have? 
"That's my point. Bitcoin is useful for the rich, not so much for the poor and unbanked. Bitcoin is useful for Investing, Speculation, Securing of wealth, hiding Wealth etc. It does not work as money, or money transfer or digital cash. The core team is restricting the use of money in bitcoin and the market is supporting this by increasing the price.

Bitcoin is actively choosing for other blockchains to take up that space. At least that is how I would interpret the actions of bitcoin miners and the core team."
It goes to the miner who verifies your transaction 
"There is no reason for bitocoin not to be usable for such transactions. It is indeed a limitation. You main want to accept that limitation but there is not technical reason for it. Bitcon can and will scale a few orders of magnitude in terms of capacity.

Satoshi himself made clear many times to many people that small transactions were part of the main goal and that the vending machine was the typical example of the usability of bitcoin. After a while he started to reply like this:

""If you don't agree with me I am not willing to argue""

Because it is a ridiculous concern and he goit fed up with fighting non sense. We could right now raise the blocks to 20MB and the network would survive just fine. some network participants would be required to upgrade their infrastructure, but hey, that's life.

I am upset that we are strangling bitcoin by imposing artificial limits that would hardly make sense in 1997, let alone 20 years later.

Bitcoin already worked for even tens of cents. It was those incompetent meta-retards from blockstream that willingly crippled it.

Would you think it's fine if your country's  government removes all coins and bills worth less than 50 usd and just tell you to find some other system?

"The only thing that matters, can the money be spent or not? With a lot of these addresses, money is stuck and can't move.

This dataset contains no addresses with a zero balance.
"You realize that that is complete bollocks and that if they quit today literally nothing bad would happen?

That statement is embarassing, no offense. "
"Then again, the cost of adding another input to a tx isn't equivalent to the an entire tx bounty (""fee""), which adjusts the number of unspendable coins down again.

Actually, how many bytes does an additional P2PKH input add to the tx size?

(Pre-post-""edit"", lol: Inputs are typically 113 bytes, I think. That's roughly half the size of a typical tx. If I read the source correctly, those addresses have an average of ~19.7k satoshis in them, but some may have up to 100k. Anyway, it's *on average* 174/sats per byte if you only count the input bytes a single input would add. Enough to be confirmed, but with a fee of at least 50 % of the value.)"

All of these use cases eclipse ""actual"" economic activity (buying coffee in person, or clothes over the internet) in amount, volume, velocity."

Hmm... So a bitcoin will still be a bitcoins worth of value, it's just how it's classified? I've never been prompted to choose. I always just buy bitcoins (generic) 
Its a tragedy that people would be so petty as to block segwit because of reasons external to it
"Yea but if there was a decentralized wallet service that couldn't be scammed or shutdown I think it would be more or equally secure as a hardware wallet. Either way you can make backup copy's on a USB stick. I guess online you can probably get hacked, keylogged etc. 

Secure as in the risk of losing coins."
nah man. segwit is not political. it works within the confines of the protocol. its pushing it to the limit. people who dont want segwit are being political. and its going to be incredibly cringe months down the line where miners are still not signalling. its just going to stall completely. and because of what? it makes 0 sense tbh
"To be fair, this is about the most interesting thing happening on the planet at this very moment.

We are literally watching the birth of an entirely new form of government and politics.  Governance WITHOUT any government, the community self regulating through a variety of somewhat democratic and somewhat meritocratic (nodes, miners, economic majority, business adoption) metrics.  And all of this is being done online, in real time, by anonymous parties.

It is beyond fascinating, like many other moments in Bitcoin's history this is writing the textbook on entirely new advances in humanity's knowledge."
It's an oversimplification to say segwit is being blocked out of spite. I bet that if BU, classic, or some other client were supporting segwit at this point in time, it would have more people running it. However supporting segwit is not like flipping a switch and it has a political component as well that stems from the same divisiveness that  those in control of the communication channels and a few influential individuals have been working on. 
Being SegWit ready does not voice any opinion about BU. It  means that they are prepared to support SegWit if it activates.
"Sure, which is why you backup an encrypted copy of your seed.

The thing with online services is they can be hacked or pull exit scams.

Or in Coinbase's case, they can simply confiscate your money.

That really puts in perspective the constant raging over how long it is taking to dethrone Core and how many annoyances there are along the way. This thing is huge. It has taken its toll on Bitcoin in the short term, but the results will be unprecedented throughout all of human history.

"Bitcoin Unlimited in itself is not so interesting, what we want is a working Bitcoin.  If a ""working crypto"" was all we wanted, it would be better and easier to abandon Bitcoin and start using some altcoin.  What's most valuable with Bitcoin is the network effect and the brand name.  If we end up splitting the network into two chains we'll lose the value proposition.  

Hence, before mining 2MB-blocks it's really paramount that we have not only a small majority of the miners behind it, but sufficient support (both among the miners and the rest of the community) that the miners would feel confident in mining 2 MB blocks.

By adding such a fail-safe flag, we'd efficiently be flagging both that we're not 100% confident in BU, and also that we're considering a 1MB-chain as legitimate.  The small-block fanatics would siege any such detail to proclaim their chain is the only real Bitcoin."
Would you stop talking like you have a satoshi hoard of bitcoins, go sell them, nobody cares.  Only a fool talks like you do, not hedging your bets.  That's how you end up broke!  You guys have your heads so far up your own asses you can't see what is around you.  But hey, it's your decision.
100% agree although most people have no idea. Hard fork would be epic lol. Definitely shake things up and ETF decision imminent, what a week!
Why is it a more serious change than the big blocks themselves? I mean I get what you are saying, but this is a really thin line. I'd love to hear your take on the difference.
LOL
That would make sense if they have so many servers in different places. No reason to risk more blocks than necessary while testing for  full rollout, especially given the recent bug. Emergent consensus is the original Satoshi plan, the only way Bitcoin can really work, and now increasingly recognized as the obvious path forward. The rest is details.
It is certainly more than enough reason for me to celebrate, Core is losing control of the network and the narrative at full speed now.
"Yes, and the biggest problem was the lack of open community debate in /r/Bitcoin, and discussion only needs to decentralise once.  For instance Theymos can't stop the current surge in Bitcoin Unlimited with his ban hammer like he did with Bitcoin Classic, his powder is all essentially expended and he'll never get it back.  I hope in hindsight he feels it was worth it.

Such are the growing pains of a revolutionary technology."
Thank you :) 
Do you know anything about online wallets like Omni? Are they decentralized? If so they could be more secure than a piece of hardware like Trezor no?
Please feel free to explain it to me, in great detail. I suspect that you cannot.
"We'll see. My opinion is that the exchanges don't want segwit per se, they just want progress so that their bottom line stops hurting.

Either way, I don't think Core commands anywhere close to the 90%+ ""user"" support that they would need to make this feasible. And they certainly don't have the hashrate, or they would be using it to activate segwit the safe way."
"> Only a fool talks like you do, not hedging your bets. That's how you end up broke! 

I am very clear that users should have diversified investments in land, gold, businesses , index funds, and fiat, and follow that advice myself. I will be fine either way, but thanks for your concerns. "
"It's a tragedy core and theymos are blocking segwit via their zero intentions of a reasonable compromise, the backstab that was Hong Kong and the active splitting of the community (theymos).

Hopefully the future people in charge of the codelines will be a bit more agreeable and if BU happens to ""win"" hopefully the emergent consensus is a reasonable one."
If you had 1 bitcoin which is today worth $1275 and tomorrow there was a hard fork...  you would then have 1 bitcoin and 1 bitcoin unlimited coin. The market will determine what the new value of each is but at the moment of the fork I would say 1 bitcoin equals $637.50 and 1 bitcoin unlimited coin equals $637.50. So you have the same value of $1275 but most likely one coin will be worth more than than the other. 
A mining network of bitfury, btcc, & slush, with bitfury controlling more than 51%... that would be really decentralised.
"And even when it does go to 75%, I have a feeling it's going to be very carefully organized. Similar to how ViaBTC wrote up in their blog post:

https://medium.com/@ViaBTC/miner-guide-how-to-safely-hard-fork-to-bitcoin-unlimited-8ac1570dc1a8

They wouldn't mess this up. It's their livelihood."
Once it's over 51%, I think it will get to 75% quicker than we predict.
Then it wouldn't be bitcoin anymore, but an altcoin.
This, very much this. 
"This is the first time a hard fork has been ""contentious"". It was made contentious by people bringing politics into a technical debate. This sets the precedent for future hard forks, the first fight is typically the bloodiest as people figure out what the end result might be. When this hard fork goes off without a hitch miners will be less hesitant and more willing to fork to another client in the future if they don't agree with the direction the current one they use is going."
Oh I agree, Bitcoin is meant to be centerless, which is why Blockstream is so fucking offensive with everything they are doing. It is an aberration to Satsohi and the vision.

The thing with physical items is they can get lost or damaged.
Also, if you send off an exchange into a wallet BEFORE the fork you will get coins on both sides - so that might be worth looking into.
"> if they want to be the dominant fork of BTC, they need at least 50.00000000000000000...1%,

I think one would need ~55% hashing power to be 50% certain that the big-block-chain would survive after first attempt on a chain-split, due to random-walk and an asymmetry.

If a big block is mined, and half of the network does not recognize it as a valid block, the chain is split.  If the small-block-chain ever outgrows the big-block-chain (which is likely to happen during the first few blocks) the big-block-chain will be abandoned by everyone.  This is asymmetric as the smallblockers will never accept the bigblock-chain.

Since 50% probability isn't good enough and since most actors don't want a split causing two competing bitcoins to be around, there won't be any split without at least 75% of the mining power supports bigger blocks.

> The long answer is that they could just as easily fork off right now,

No, with the current BU-logic, it's impossible to fork off a ""bigblock-network"" without having a hashing majority.  As soon as a BU miner observes that the smallblock-chain is longer, it will abandon the bigblock-chain.  There has been talks about modifying the software so that it's possible to do a minority-fork ... but this minority-fork wouldn't be bitcoin, it would be an altcoin, and since there are already hundreds of altcoins to choose between it doesn't make much sense to create yet another altcoin.

This so much. Blockstream and the Core Usurper devs quite like their position as the dictators of Bitcoin with the support Theymos the forum enforcer. Their toxic behavior, mocking of a significant portion of the community... the fact that they designed Segwit... when the entire community was already screaming for a blocksize increase before the censorship started... and then are surprised when Segwit isn't adopted... insane. Their behavior would have already led to their firing had they been a traditional company.  
"/r/btc is not a default sub so no one that is not already subscribed is seeing this as far as I know.

/r/Bitcoin is though so that's certainly on some newbies front pages."
oh so r/btc isn't altcoin shitcentral?
Indeed. It's worth wondering what slush will do with the unvoted portion of their hashrate. That could tip the balance entirely.
My BU is ready.
Bitcoin has 2 main roadmaps atm, core and bitcoin unlimited. Core is pushing to implement a soft fork called segwit and BU is gathering support to perform a hard fork following their roadmap which could split bitcoin into 2 separate networks. Antpool is a very large mining pool which is now siding with BU.  
"Yes they're the biggest pool but so far they haven't gone 100% all in for Bitcoin Unlimited, I edited my top comment earlier to add the following;

Bitcoin Unlimited blocks have so far come from AntPool bj5 and AntPool bj8. These are possibly AntPool nodes located in Beijing, so far AntPool nodes in other locations haven't been updated yet: https://www.blocktrail.com/BTC/pool/antpool

*Hopefully AntPool/Jihan Wu will soon clarify what they're up to."
Not 100% yet but probably soon enough.
Since you have posted, they have found 2 more blocks, and the last one of that 2 is BU again.
At the moment, I'm counting 4 of the last 14 AntPool blocks as BU - and 2 of the last 10.
Most of the AntPool blocks have been non-BU since the first AntPool BU block. I haven't counted, but it feels like around 25% of the AntPool blocks are coming in as BU for now.  It's still good news, but let's hope that percentage increases soon :)
It means that we may have taken a step forward in the scaling solution debate. Most of us here favor BU as that solution. The hope is to increase the block size so more transactions per second can happen and transaction fees can continue to be affordable.
Core implementation which the capacity is stuck at 1 mb/blocks is being replaced for Bitcoin Unlimited by the largest mining pool and ASIC manufacturer. Bitcoin Unlimited allows miners and nodes to configure their own limit.
I doubt it would upset their followers.... From what i see Core followers are bunch of mindless zombies. Its like a fcking cult. Whatever Core does, they will spin it and support no matter what.
The same thing that happens if it doesn't go through: nothing. That's not to say it's not a possibility anymore but it's always just been a long term possibility, even in core.
We're all eager to move forward! Good luck! (I'll be on the other side of things, of course :-)
Send them HERE! 1NbJLJ4phUwDUt8ENhAcE83WDgGLgT79Xz
Well, the rest of us are interested in scaling Bitcoin, not about some dickhead traders gambling profits, which is what a lot of you Core supporters seem to be far more interested in.

Suggestion? 
"He did it!! Finally :)

Good man!!"
Certain people should take note that this is what collaboration looks like. *Not* telling people they should shut up and do as they're told.
How long till a BU bug forks main net? 2 weeks? 3?
This is a big deal.
Makes sense. Core broke the Hong Kong agreement. It was bound to happen eventually.
If you are not a r/btc regular and are only seeing this because it made it to your front page, please visit this subreddit everyday! There is lots of important news here everyday. Know that r/Bitcoin is censored and not giving you the full story.
Very interesting. I suspect with AntPool signaling for BU will eventually lead to many others to start signaling for BU who were previously on the fence.

Hi, just stumbled here from /r/all. Could someone explain what this means? I'm not super familiar with the inner workings but it's a pretty heated topic it looks like. Thanks!
"BU is top thread on r/bitcoin?

"Wow. It's been a long wait yes?! 

I've been waiting all this time to again say THIS IS GENTLEMEN!!! 

Thank you /u/jihan_bitmain! "
"It's a pity that core and theymos are blocking segwit via their zero intentions of a reasonable compromise, the backstab that was Hong Kong and the active splitting of the community (this last one mostly theymos).

Hopefully the future people in charge of the codelines will be a bit more agreeable.

Hopefully, if BU does ""win"" the emergent consensus is a reasonable one and we can again have all forces, all tech, all resources, working together for scaling.
"
"AntPool? That's the biggest pool there is right?        
So are they 100% BU now?"
"#Oh shit!

#It's happening!!!"
So if F2Pool switched from 8MB blocks to BU, would we could have a majority now, if I'm not mistaken.
Thanks Jihan Wu. I really appreciate that you make your own decisions. It was the right one.
"> The Blockstream/SegWit/LN fork will be worth LESS: SegWit uses 4MB storage/bandwidth to provide a one-time bump to 1.7MB blocksize; messy, less-safe as softfork; LN=vaporware. The BU fork will be worth MORE: single clean safe hardfork solving blocksize forever; on-chain; fix malleability separately.

https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/57zjnk/the_blockstreamsegwitln_fork_will_be_worth_less/"
I don't if this is the right place to look, but the latest 5, as of yet, seem to be the regular non-BU blocks: https://btc.com/stats/pool/AntPool
"Adding all the pools that vote for BU and their hasrate the past 7 days should give the BU supporting pools a 38.51% hashrate right now (including 22.5% of slush since 22.5% of the hashrate of slush pool is voting BU).        
     
If you also count the 8MB votes that's another 6.8% on top.         
     
Segwit supporting pools had a hashrate of 22.13% of the network (including 27.55% of slush).     
    
If pools don't change alignment again and keep the same hashrate ratio as the past week, we should have almost double their hashrate.
     
"
You rock! /u/jihan_bitmain
So what does this mean for the layman who just uses BTC but doesn't actively follow development?
eli5 the background here and what happened? 
Get rekt you Core clowns.
I find the timing curious, with the ETF decision this week (a potential major price swing factor). How would we know what the market thinks of Antpool's  switch if another event possibly trumps over its effect?
Ermahgerd
Will be very interesting to see if and when Core intends to take some action. They have badly lost the initiative by now and will probably have to go to some lengths to regain it. Maybe some hardfork code could to the trick, but then again that would probably upset their base. And since the base is almost all they have left they are probably not inclined to go that route. Can't say I envy their position but they have only themselves to blame. 
It is a good idea to check this out. https://mobile.twitter.com/ViaBTC/status/800259165281251328
What happens with the lightening network project if BU goes through? Does it still happen on BU chain, just with presumably less demand, because fees will be less with BU?
"456156	AntPool	19 minutes ago

https://www.blocktrail.com/BTC/pool/antpool/1"
Did anyone figure out which locations signal BU and which not? Will Ant upgrade all hashpower to BU?
It seems obvious that neither protocol will reach 95% of the total hashing power..pretty much a deadlock
"Thanks guys

BU hashrate up, BTC price down 

easy trade, works without fail"
They agree ? No kidding, VIabtc is just a spokeperson for this group. LOL. Do you really believe what you are saying ? Or you are just supporting BU with propaganda?
"That's a very interesting question, and the answer is complicated, but the short version is, if they want to be the dominant fork of BTC, they need at least 50.00000000000000000...1%, and the more they have beyond that, the better.

The long answer is that they could just as easily fork off right now, but they would be the minority if they did. This isn't ideal, as it would most likely mean a large amount of turbulence and potentially large financial damage to bitcoin as a whole.

It's also not great to try to fork with only a simple majority, as the minority fork could choose to continue operation, which would lead to the tumult previously described.

The ideal situation would be for 100% of miners to agree to BU, before the fork, but realistically, that's never going to happen.

The realistic ""forking point"" is more a matter of opinion than anything, but the consensus seems to be around 70-80%, from what I've seen."

"Don't hold coins on Coinbase (or any other online wallet for that matter). It's insecure and they can take them from you at any time.

If you don't control your private keys, you don't control your bitcoins."
If BU gains enough support they WILL fork bitcoin and anyone with bitcoins will now hold coins valid for both networks. Bitcoins total market cap will be split into 2 parts. If you hold coins on an exchange you won't really have to do anything but might consider shifting funds into one or the other.
This is after 2 years of debating and some serious threats emerging from either side. 
I dont want an alarm clock that only goes to 10 o'clock and then has extension LEDs for 11 and 12.
I wish the same. The amount of arrogance and ego involved in this trojan horse takeover of Bitcoin in shameful. Their delight in trolling all the bitcoiners who just want to continue the original Bitcoin design goals is infuriating. The usurpers who took over Core are the equivalent of what happens when you letting random people off the street into the hospital to perform surgeries. Sure... the hospital has the same name... but it is a a complete mess, patients are dying, and soon the whole thing will fall apart.
"Absolutely. 1mb blocks are only a problem when the miners are not *choosing* 1mb blocks on their own. (not counting the obvious negative economic effect of 1mb as it stands right now).

Once the dust settles hopefully new BU miners will opt for an immediate increase to at least 2mb, just like Classic proposed 2 years ago, and we can finally leave this god awful shitstained wreck behind us. "

One miner announcing he will start mining above 1Mb at a certain date after BU has something like 55% or 60% would be enough to make most of the hash power to switch.
"Why not place a flag on the blocks indicating ""this is a BU block"", and only accept blocks with this flag after the first big block?"
"Well, it would show that the bitcoin ecosystem can hard fork **right now**.

A hard fork was significantly easier in the past, and will be significantly more difficult to activate in the future, as bitcoin grows and becomes more integrated in more peoples' systems and various use cases.

The main reason the HF to BU has been so difficult and slow and contentious has not primarily been from any conspiracy by blockstream (even if such exists) or because of Theymos' censorship (which just produced a Streissand effect anyway).

You and I may not agree with them, but a lot of people genuinely do not think that removing the block size cap is safe (or would produce, for them, unacceptable centralization pressure)...and there is absolutely an inherent coordination problem to getting thousands of independent and decentralized users and nodes and miners and merchants and blockchain services to agree on anything and activate it at high levels of consensus, even if it wasn't a disputed or contentious change being proposed. "
"It's not about replacing who sits on the iron throne of Bitcoin. It's about dissolving that throne entirely. 

Classic, XT, and even btcd are on board with emergent consensus. Core is the only major holdout, as they wish to arrogate the right to rig consensus to themselves."
"I really wish Core would just re-focus their efforts on LiteCoin.

Really, if they're so confident in their roadmap, turn LiteCoin into ""CrippleCoin with scrypt"" and see how it fares against other coins. Everyone would win. The Core developers would have their playground to test their ideas without ""interference from big blockers"", Charlie Lee and the litecoin people would get the alleged expertise of Core. And Bitcoin users would be free of Greg, Luke, and Peter once and for all.

Maybe ""CrippleCoin with scrypt"" wouldn't reach Bitcoin-like prices of $1000, but even a rise from $3 to $20 or whatever would make some people very happy. And that's what would happen, considering CrippleCoin is so desperately wanted by the market, right?

Win win?"
If shaolinfry is pushing the same junk Core devs are and feeding them bad ideas on how to force SegWit to life like Frankensteins monster, that is good enough to me for sock puppet status as well as being an asshole.
This what
They can use their old Nintendo as miners, that one guy did it
"I would say don't worry, every day the Core devs and their minions are becoming more and more unstable and desperate to the point of delusion, eventually they will choose the most wreckless and shortsighted plan that finally destroys them and whatever shred of credibility they had left. I can't imagine a more batshit plan that trying to replace Nakamoto Consensus with a sybil attack. That definitely isn't the Bitcoin I signed up for.

I also dare them to do it because it would be hilarious."
I'm encouraging them. It's so stupid. 
In that end, I hope ViaBTC makes good on it's promise to also spend any amount of money to curbstomp any minority split chain that dares to call itself Bitcoin. 
">> You can't have transactions without miners.

You and your throwaway account must be having a bad day.

If you change the mining algorithm... You just have new miners. And a much less secure network. Bitcoin doesn't work without them."

I welcome a price set back 
Why on earth would a hard fork cause any loss of confidence? If the market supports emergent consensus over Core central consensus, ipso facto the fork will cause the price to rise - probably dramatically like a buoy held under water.
What rock have you been living under the past 5 years?
Yeah. May bad. 😜

"Slush only has about 6.4% of the network hasrate, so I don't see them having that large of an impact. 

It is my understanding that somewhere in the range of 23% of the network (as of yesterday) was signaling for BU support, AntPool and BTC.com collectively have about 20% of the network hashrate, so a total of about 43% of the network is theoretically signaling for BU support. 

If many of the smaller pools were to start signaling BU support in masse, then I would peg the chances of BU 'activating' to be quite high. "
I would believe the same thing

"Does this mean anything for a typical dude with a stash of bitcoins sitting on coinbase? I can't tell if this is good for bitcoin, or only a certain ""type"" of bitcoins?"

"Very good point. 
AXA should have been publicly called out for that by now. "
"You can add ""wy"" and ""bj15"" to that list."
"25% of antipool is stil good and its a good sign. But 100% world be even better.     
But even if they join 100% we need at least 1 more big pool to join us or several smaller ones. At least we should have more hashrate than core by now, but we're somewhere around 30~35%. I do think that this may be the tipping over point though."
A really neat aspect to this is the minority hash chain would have several advantages in this trading. First advantage is the original coin would have 25% or less hashpower therefore it will be easier to transfer the BUforkcoin to an exchange. BU supporters wanting to dump their original btc on exchanges will have to wait for seriously delayed confirmations while the original chain supporters will be able to get quicker confirmations to quickly devastate the price of BUforkcoin. BU miners will lose a lot of money here. 
">AntPool is updating all nodes to Unlimited.

how do you know?"
That is incredibly dependent on the level of consensus reached prior to the fork. If more than 70 or 80% of the hashing power sides with BU, I really don't see the fork driven price drop being very large at all. Especially considering the immediately apparent improvements in usability.
This is gentlemen, mark my word!
"> The policy of the miners is to not shovel the fees/their income/the network security off-chain (off Bitcoin).

"Ultimately it boils down to a whole bunch of us wanting to basically fire the Bitcoin Core development team for doing a really, really poor job of handling the protocol and the community, all of which is now split and stagnant.

A major pool has now started showing support for the team we would like to replace the Core team, so it is pretty big stuff, and highly encouraging we actually might see this change in leadership sooner than later so we can get back to the Bitcoin dream instead of bickering. "

It would be best to wait for some reasonable grace period after 75% is achieved. This would give other miners and pools, exchanges, and users the chance to upgrade. It would also give time to determine if the minority fork has any chance of surviving, and allow the exchanges and users time to prepare for handling Corecoins.
There's no need for that much. At 55% or 60%, somebody announces he will start mining above 1Mb after a week or so. Most hash power would migrate.
"> its pushing it to the limit. people who dont want segwit are being political

Yes of course. The policy of the miners is to not shovel the fees/their income/the network security off-chain (off Bitcoin)."
"75% is a nice rule of thumb, because it means this:

In the event of a truly hostile fork, 50% of total hashpower can preserve the main chain while 25% counterattacks the minority chain."
