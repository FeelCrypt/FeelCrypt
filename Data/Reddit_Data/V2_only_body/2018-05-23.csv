"I Want to, what did he bought ?i dont see coin or stock

edit , salty comments << realise im on r btc 
btw why this sub is not r bch ?"
However the accredited investor tokens are coming. Sadly, i believe this is what will commercialize crypto.
Funny thing: hedge funds don't beat your average S&P 500 ETF. This is because they take much higher fees, but on average perform about the same as their exposure to the market.
Markets are in the shitter, i can confirm this. 
Yes, tge transfer is the total loss of btc investments when they go to their true value of zero. 
"This is a wholly inaccurate comparison. The reason those aren’t available to anyone besides “qualified” and “accredited” investors has nothing to do with some scheme to keep the high returns among the wealthy. 

The reason is merely a risk management perspective. 

Hedge funds tend to lock up money in quarterly or six month time frames, the manager needs unlimited access to those funds without worry of redemption or the model doesn’t work. If you want a hedge fund invest in a liquid alternative. 

Venture Capital and Private Equity investments lock up money between 7-20 years because that is how long it takes to generate value with a private investment and those investments are illiquid. For that reason most direct investments target institutions (endowments/pensions) with a $1M minimums. Even fund of fund investments have a $100k minimum and they are only available to qualified investors (over $1m in assets or $200k in yearly income) because your average investor can not feasibly park $100k in an investment vehicle that won’t provide liquidity for several years.

Other things you can invest in without permission.

-Equities
-Fixed Income
-Most derivatives 

Those three make up the majority of the investable universe and do not require being a qualified or accredited investor."
It depends how you define money. I'd say, historically, that fiat isn't money.
Nobody is forced to sell. Whales can do what they want, if you're fooled by their games you'll just make it easier for them to dump the market in the future. If you hold you help keep money out of their hands, every bit adds up, if it didn't why would they be trying to manipulate money out of you? Btw spending crypto is different, go ham with that to help fuel adoption and give people a real reason to hold like you say, but selling to whales is foolish and just fuels them further. If you don't sell to them they'll help pump it eventually, their in this game for moon gainz too.
"> If you don't sell to them they'll help pump it eventually,

They don't have to pump it, they can easily just let it die. Holding is a guaranteed way to make money. "

The ability to know when the market makers are going to pump or dump something is lost on us all my friend, unfortunately. 
"But that's inevitably what will happen anyway. You don't use gold to buy your milk, and you won't use whatever emerges as the global crypto reserve currency either. Because it can happen, it will happen.

The top tier will be traded amongst countries and multinationals and that is it. I doubt it will be any of the current major cryptos."
">If any crypto becomes owned by the 1%, people will just start up another one to use amongst themselves.

That's one of the arguments against Proof-of-Stake.

A gold reserve would be a PoS by definition. It would be unprovable and prone to fractional reserve practices."
">The top 1% as in the top wealthy individuals, not in terms of salary.

In a way, you could argue it's even easier to get into the top 1% by wealth than by income.

Salaries are distributed very tightly by IQ. Net worth is not. It's all over the place by comparison. So you are, in a sense, less limited by your genes when it comes to net worth than when it comes to salary in practice.

There are many reasons for this. One is that you can inherit money. (Though you may not keep it long if you're really quite dumb.)

Another major reason however, is that you can be a business owner of a tire store or a plumbing supply company or a farm, not have a very high IQ at all, be very good with managing cash flow, and gain a very high net worth if it is of interest to you to do so.

Furthermore, you could be a professor or public school teacher with a very high IQ and have an artificially low net worth because your fortune is tied up in a government pensions that's worth literally millions of dollars at current interest rates, all while you cry poverty.

Things are always a bit more complex than sound bites make them appear."
Why would they let it die if they're invested?
Ask an inside trader. They know.
"**Nixon shock**

The Nixon shock was a series of economic measures undertaken by United States President Richard Nixon in 1971, the most significant of which was the unilateral cancellation of the direct international convertibility of the United States dollar to gold.

While Nixon's actions did not formally abolish the existing Bretton Woods system of international financial exchange, the suspension of one of its key components effectively rendered the Bretton Woods system inoperative. While Nixon publicly stated his intention to resume direct convertibility of the dollar after reforms to the Bretton Woods system had been implemented, all attempts at reform proved unsuccessful. By 1973, the Bretton Woods system was replaced de facto by the current regime based on freely floating fiat currencies.

We're only disagreeing on the percentages. If only wealth gets more wealth then eventually only one person would own everything.
"> The top funds in either category beat index funds by multiples.

Of course, because you're comparing the TOP funds vs. the AVERAGE of index funds. Furthermore, index funds are already TRACKING AN INDEX. In other words, they're an AVERAGE of a certain asset class.

The top stocks also outperformed the top hedge funds by an order of magnitude. This is because each stock is more volatile than an index or a hedge fund.

But this doesn't help you to pick the best hedge fund or stock - past performance is not a good indicator of future performance."
"Any time [prior to 1971](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixon_shock) gold and money were linked. You could go back thousands of years and this remained the same. The status quo of floating currencies is a relatively new experiment - all each does is signify the relative power of their origin governments, rather than having intrinsic value in of itself.

i mean, if one wants to invest something, why should there be someone grant their right?
Maybe for the US exchanges. 
"> Goverments are just tools in rich people toolbox

True. But when two very different systems of money collide, wealth transfers are inevitable
Refer to biased Bitcoin centric website for info on Bitcoin's greatest flaw. Ok
"It was not addressed in this list, it's not a myth. U can track every bitcoin up to a block in which it was mined (with mixers it's harder, but not impossible), if u'll build large enough graphs, u can deanonymize a lot of actors. Atomic swaps may make a graph-building extremely expensive

Where to place Bitcoin on a fungibility scale? I'd say: worse than physical cash, way better than digital fiat. Physical cash is disappearing around the world"
"> Private capital is the true real monster of our age

"> They are regulated by the government,

> (also you need to be rich)."
"> a company to provide audited financials and a modicum of accurate disclosure to potential investors constitutes ""burdensome regulation.""

If it is not burdensome than why have the regulation?  Companies would do it on their own.  And if investors want it, a company would provide it."
"> That's why the government bans them, unless you're super rich then they let you throw your money away.

But the state runs lottery tickets?  Why no double standard?  The canard is that regulations are done to ""protect the poor.""  While people complain about the rich getting richer, the sheep clamor for more regulations."
"> You have to register as a qualified investor

That is the whole point of the thread."
That's why god created Bolsheviks, guillotines, and income tax brackets.
">You were not, are not, and will not, ever be on the same playing field as the top 1%.

What are you talking about? People move in and out of the top 1% all the time. Your chances of being in it at some point are actually fairly high. 

(Doubly so if you have a sufficient IQ to understand why BCH makes sense.)

Globally speaking, if you are middle class in a developed nation, you are probably in the global 1% already."
"> Wealthy will always create wealth faster than the poor. 

Wealth is not what creates wealth, being prosperous is what creates wealth. Yes, having means can make one more prosperous, but being poor does not stop one from working hard, and creating something someone richer than you values. 


>Poor work themselves, capital works for wealthy. 

**This is 100% true of the existing system** those who want more capital can create more money by loaning it into existence just because they already have capital assets. They then buy productive assets that create wealth that they use to pay off the loan. 

The mechanism by which the wealthy get more wealthy is facilitated by fractional reserve banking. It needs fiat money. Remove the mechanism, and you remove the means of getting wealthy with wealth, the only way to make new wealth with hard money is to create things of value.


>Wealth inequality will skyrocket

wealth inequality is caused by taking wealth from the poor and giving it to the rich. 

The mechanism is called the Cantillon Effect: increasing the money supply affects relative inflation, or how a disproportionate rise in prices among different goods in an economy over time, **will benefit those who are first to receive it** and diminish the wealth of those in the economy who have to experience inflation before earning the new money. 

Bitcoin redistributes wealth; the system may start with a disproportionate distribution of wealth, but it will stabilize in a similar way to the way I described it at the beginning of this chat thread.  

Bitcoin is free market those who work and produce value get richer those who don't get poorer. There will always be poor lazy people, Bitcoin gives an opportunity to the poor hard working people one that our western Crony Capitalist system does not give.  "
They can play the Forex game, too, if they are feeling really fast and loose.  Granted, through a very limited number of traders.
"It's definitely a stupid policy.  People should be free to do whatever they want with their money, including wasting it in hedge fund fees, but it's not a privilege afforded to the rich to have access to hedge funds, or a policy designed to keep the little guy down by only allowing the rich access to ""good"" investments - it's the opposite of that."
They sure exist on other exchanges around the world too. 
"> The difference is with Bitcoin people who save can erode the wealth of the 1%

Not true. It's not a zero-sum game. Wealthy will always create wealth faster than the poor. Poor work themselves, capital works for wealthy. Wealth inequality will skyrocket"
"Absolutely right. Everyone made money last year in crypto. That doesn't make you an expert trader. And personally if you are looking at this technology as a new digital asset class to be speculated on with the intent of making capital gains...then you miss the point and you deserve to pay all those taxes. People completely miss the utility this tech offers. You can operate completely privately with a private currency with private parties...none of that needs to include a statutory entity. That's a big fucking deal. 

Side note, most cryptocurrencies being traded on exchanges don't qualify as a currency anyway. They don't attempt to solve the same problems bitcoin does. They are quit literally securities, or shares of a company just those shares are tokenized and put on a blockchain. "
Very good point. Still would not recommend selling to whales tho lol.
Monero is very likely the most fungible money that exists after physical cash, but it's not most sound money, cos it lacks immutability, scarcity, transferability. To improve fungibility I'd recommend BCH-XMR-BCH txs, but it may be the case that Bitcoin's innate fungibility is enough for u
That's why ICOs are booming. People have spare money, want better returns and have no investment experience
"Well a HELOC gets you most of the way there.

In Australia it's 2.5m, including house and that's barely adequate as median price is about 1m in major cities and you can have up to 1.5m in super untaxed. That's grandma and grandpa being 'sophisticated'.

100k isn't an unusual salary either. It's not too hard to get there, where it really should be impossible unless you are a big financial player."
I wish you weren't wrong, else we would have one holy grail of a currency before us.

"We're not lumping in the billion in Africa who literally don't even know what a computer is, the top 1% is spoken up figuratively, meaning you will never reach that type of wealth or status. Remember that whole 99%er vs top 1%er on wall street type thing? That's what 1% means. You won't ever be in it, just accept that. Nobody here will most likely, or you wouldn't be posting here. 

Please tell me you don't think people who believe some internet money is going to work somehow have a higher IQ than other people who don't share that belf, because that's a really terrible way to get people to believe in your product or idea

Fungibility is the weakest part of Bitcoin, but so far we've seen no evidence of discrimination between bitcoins on any decent scale. It might be an overblown issue
"> the wealth will distribute according to the Pareto principle

Nope. Less friction - bigger disparity between quantiles"
