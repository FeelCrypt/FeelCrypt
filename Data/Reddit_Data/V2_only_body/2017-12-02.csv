There are over 300 developers in core. Blockchain only accounts to less than 10% of them. I have faith in all of them, even though I don't know all the tech term. Let's just wish both us both luck. Hopefully both coins will go up.
What's sad is that we wouldn't even have / need Litecoin if the stupid block size limit had even been raised coincident with even the most conservative provable measures of Moore's Law and software enhancements. No wonder that the very people responsible for the failure to improve Bitcoin are now pitching Litecoin.
i dont thinketh , I know it. 
Nothing wrong with that statement. It is like saying the Internet is big but Friendster, Prodigy and AOL are crap. 
Lol this just gets more confusing the more you learn about it.  So Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash are two different cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin Cash being the one that has streamlined spending?
Yes, then the fees should be pennies. The artificial scarcity of room in the block chain is what's driving your fees
Except multi billion dollar corporations can afford to mine block chains themselves and charge a fee for using it.
sorry. You sound disappointed. I'm sorry.
bruh, I'm trolling the btc shill and you messed it up. 
"Yes, two different cryptocurrencies, but it depends on your definition of ""streamlined"". Bitcoin Cash's transactions are cheaper for now, but fewer businesses accept Bitcoin Cash, and it isn't integrated into all the exchanges for buying other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin is."

One other thing to note is that this subreddit was around before BCH existed so I'm guessing you are new to Bitcoin and/or Reddit or you did know that and you are flat out trying to lie to persuade people to your point of view. Either way it makes for a weaker argument on your part. If BTC is King, then it doesn't need some noob that knows only what he learned from one sub for less then 2 weeks to defend it.

Sadly the job they are doing is preventing bitcoin, as designed, from becoming a functional payment system.

Uh no! Otherwise Bitcoin Cash had segwit. The devs intentionally did not copy Core's work.
Nobody in core wrote bitcoin, they hijacked the project and kicked out all the original developers.

Don’t worry, they actually have devs working on Bitcoin, unlike Bcash

Check the account age and karma. That's another sockpuppet troll.
i think you misunderstood. he didn't create this account just to comment that roger ver kills people- it's roger's money that sneaks out every night and goes on killing sprees. i suspect there's a time machine involved as well.
Or tag them so you can keep an eye on them when they try and intentionally stir things up in discussions.

Is Wladimir van der Laan employed by Blockstream? I thought not.
Is there evidence of that?
"> Their reddit and twitter troll armies.

Are you being serious?

> The fact they paid real money to buy /r/bitcoin in order to push their narrative. Any non-compliant viewpoint results in a ban.

I agree rBitcoin is a shitpile of memes.

> Their scaling conferences where nobody is allowed to present topics on scaling.

If you organise a conference you set the rules. Nobody's stopping anyone else organising their own conferences.

> Their threats to change POW to scare miners into compliance.

Empty threats. No-one has the power to do that unilaterally not even Boogyman Blockstream.

> The Digital Currency Group, one of their investors, employs Wladimir van der Laan who singlehandly decides what gets into the next version of bitcoin. Wladimir rejects everything that improves scaling with any excuse he can find whilst allowing flawed changes like the hated RBF and even SegWit.

So fork it."
"> As soon a you change a bit it's not a copy anymore.

Errr... no that's not how it works. Lots of the source files will still be the same or substantially so. Changing one bit doesn't make something entirely new. It creates a derivative work.

If you want to be pedantic, how about we drop the word ""copy"" and say that Bitcoin Cash is a derivative of Bitcoin Core?"
Yeah. It says in a very long winded way that they employed a couple of devs and put on a couple of conferences. But eveyrone thinks they are Keyser Soze reincarnate. Am I missing something here?
Seems to me the payroll is 99% trolls. How much did *your* dignity and self-respect cost them? Not all that much, I'd imagine.
"You are aware that bitcoin core is open source and anyone can publish an alternative, right? 

If Blockstream is really so lacking in community support, why doesn't someone fork the code. Oh yeah - they already tried that, and nobody wanted it."
"I'm suggesting that instead of waiting around for someone else to save us, that we do it ourselves.

You can ridicule a direct approach but that doesn't really help, does it? Anyone who wants to take a constructive path, I'm interested."
What makes your guys so naive that core only contributed segwit?
"People come and go in open source software. The core team now is a different team as yesteryear. Forks are merged, code is pulled in and master is being branched. Calling bitcoin cash a copy of bitcoin core is still stupid. Yes, a branch start with a ""copy"".If you're being pedantic about it: with every accepted pull request `bitcoin/bitcoin` is ""copied"" from a specific developers branch and becomes latest in the main branch. As soon a you change a bit it's not a copy anymore. Kind of the point of open source software. "
A fork begins with a copy.
Nobody disputing that fact.. Still not a copy but a fork away from core
Bitcoin Cash was created from a modified version Bitcoin Core as found at http://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin. This is a fact. Are you trying to deny this?
"> You are still a liar.

What is with all you r/bitcoin folks that you cannot have a difference of opinion with someone without calling everyone a liar.

I honestly believe that 80% of the r/bitcoin folks are deluded.  But hey, if they believe the propaganda, that doesn't make them liars, it makes them misguided.

I honestly believe that the central banks don't want a FREE peer to peer currency - it is a threat to their monopoly.  I believe they want to destroy Satoshi's vision and replace it with a rent system.

That is not a lie, it is what I believe.  If you believe other than that, write your reply but please spare me the insults."
"I don't think Blockstream wants to destroy BTC as we know it today.

What they don't want is the Bitcoin that was envisioned by Satoshi.  They want a coin that they can control and steer.  They want a coin they can charge rent on.

They want to destroy a free peer to peer coin.

How have they done so far?

My BCH transaction was completed 5 hours ago in 15 minutes and the cost was FREE.  I paid 0 fees.

My last two BTC transactions took hours and I paid $10 and $12.

I'm not just saying that the Digital Currency Group want to destroy Bitcoin, I'm saying that they already have.  BTC is a banker coin.

BCH is Bitcoin."
Yes, i know how open source sofware forks works. if you think core created or owns the code than you are the one that is naive. 
Hey I love it here
see no evil, hear no evil
"Ooh and now changing your mind is a bad thing? Why do you care so much what ""one of the Digital Currency folks"" says or once said? Bitcoin as a system is so much more than this.

Anyway, saying ""bitcoin is a threat and should be outlawed"" is called expressing an opinion. It is not a threat as you said. 
You are a liar.

EDIT in response to your edit:

Again, there is no threat here. this is expressing an opinion. This was someone representing Mastercard of all things. Of course they wouldn't be comfortable with bitcoin.

You are still a liar."
"Bitcoin Cash software is basically a copy of core with a couple of bits removed and some parameters changed. Believing otherwise makes you naive. ""Core"" didn't just add SegWit, they worked on the software for years and years before that too. All of that is right there inside Bitcoin Cash."
Ok I got the point, you need to help Jihan sell his machines better, that is a serous business, understand that.
Of your last 30 or so post 27 are to r/btc/. For a place you dont like you spend an awful lot of time here
Like the con-artists they are, they like to erase all evidence of their wrongdoings.
"> Also sad is that you seem to think that someone can ""run"" bitcoin.

Why not, they ""run"" the governments of countries.  You think a couple of core nerds are so tough?  They can't be bought off, blackmailed, or fluffed?

Take a look at the r/bitcoin forum - it is clearly being ""run."""
"Barry Silbert:

""We at Mastercard are not completely comfortable with the idea of cryptocurrencies, largely **because they go against the whole principal that we have established our business on which is really moving to a world beyond cash** ensuring greater transparency, security and simplicity in the way people live their lives. If you think about it Cash is a problem for a number of countries. Cash really facilitates anonymity, it facilitate illegal activity, it facilitates tax avoidance...and a range of other things that aren't going to drive efficiency in an economy. Trust is a critical component of any payment system. So if you think about the idea that all of a sudden your having cryptocurrencies being ""manufactured"" if you like on an anonymous computer in an anonymous location, it's completely legitimate to have some concerns about how that might be working. What a regulator wants to do is ensure there is a fully compliant root to the transaction, that they understand who is making the transaction, who the payment is being made to and that they have a suitable record so they can ensure there is credential control over the system. **If it's an anonymous transaction, that sounds like a suspicious transaction. Why does someone need to be anonymous? I certainly don't want anyone mining technology or mining financial services away from my control, particularly if they're going represent something from me.""**"
"They also contributed RBF, a nasty hack designed to make 0-conf transactions easily stealable.

The current core team stole the project from the real core developers, who they forced out."
You can hardly call it a COPY of core when the whole point of the fork was is to do things different than core. How is that naive? 
Every material change has been away from the principles in the white paper, so no.
Actually we very much dont appreciate segwit
I work for free, bubba
"> I don't believe blockstream fucked up.

They clearly didn't. The sheeple are playing along with them."
Their agenda is aligned with the banking system, which is a direct conflict of interest for Bitcoin itself. What did anyone expect to happen?
"u forgot the /s :)


especially necessary when core trolls have been spamming the sub with ""bcash"" all day."
It doesn't make any sense why? That is really strange.
"So you are lying that they vowed to crush bitcoin. What actually happened was that someone expressed an opinion about economics.

A lot of lying goes on in this sub. Pretty sad.

Also sad is that you seem to think that someone can ""run"" bitcoin."
I was referring to 2x.
Then wouldn’t you appreciate core’s work?
I hope your software is not a COPY of core’s 
"> The owners/directors of Blockstream vowed to crush Bitcoin.

What do you mean by this?"
"This is 20th century thinking. The credibility is found in the quality of the writing, the quality of the research, the sources quoted, the citations and evidence, and the social proof (comments, shares, etc). Begging an authority at the top of the hierarchy to do your job for you is passive, self-minimizing and just a waste of time.

They will cover a killer article on Medium about this that gets 10,000 shares, is covered by the bitcoin media outlets and is circulated among all the top influencers in the crypto world. 

That's how you get the mainstream media to do your bidding. Never by begging them with a long reddit comment."
"Greg. Sorry typed the message on my phone, got totally fucked up. LOL. Missed the most important information bit.

Edit: no, I'm not drunk."
The expose could be what triggers the story to end! At the very least, more awareness at this crucial time seems like a positive thing.
"> I think for the expose to really have any resounding impact as a story we need to see how the story ends.

I don't think that's true at all.

Often exposés serve as a wake-up call for the public, to ""expose"" a problem to the public that needs more attention. 

To wait around till the story ends before writing about it negates the whole purpose of investigative journalism.

A recent example was the piece written by The New York Times on Harvey Weinstein. If they had waited till he was caught to write the article, he'd still be out there and that article would probably never get written.

And an exposé on Blockstream is 100x more relevant to the average American than anything about Harvey Weinstein, considering how many non-investors are now investing in Bitcoin without knowing anything about it.

I would think that publications like wsj, need to steer clear of hypotheticals.  Finding information on bitmain and it's associations would be trivial and more important to the investment community.

"Do you really think Blockstream has taken over bitcoin, or is this just a popular narrative people are rallying round?

Apart from employing a few of the Bitcoin Core software maintainers, what power does Blockchain have?

I personally think people have built them up into this big boogeyman and attributed them powers they don't really have. It's nice to have a tangible enemy to blame and this community has picked Blockstream, whether it's true or not."
"Seeing as basically every notable media corporation is a front for government policy - and the wallstreet journal being one of the worst, I find it very unlikely they are going to shine light onto their own shady doings. Let's be frank - anybody who thinks wall street has nothing to do with blockstream need to re evaluate their stance. Wall street won't invest in something that they can't guarentee the outcome. Big business starts ""investing"" when BTC price starts exploding - not a coincidence IMO. 


So I would say its irrelevant and a waste of time. This is just business as usual. The media are not our friends at all. In fact, if I started seeing that on mainstream media, I would likely need to reevaluate my stance because they lie about EVERYTHING."
Cashmere Hill at Forbes writes bitcoin pieces. 
"This is a great view from the other side.

We are challenged with misinformation from both sides. It doesn’t help when Roger flips people off and then that is what the newcomers see. Regardless of the how the conversation happened that is not what the masses will see.

Send it not just to WSJ but to all those big financial news sites
... maybe ordered by he banks, keep the tx/s low (weak point of BTC), share german angst (weak point of users) and finally take over the devlopment (i here they are still laughing about the stubidity/greedity of most of the devs). Now we are here.

I remember the early crowd on bitcointalk and reddit had a sense of the importance of what was happening to our dialogue. It was a concerted effort to steer and confuse everyone with well thought out lines of attack. Nothing has changed, we silently compared notes and actively challenged the antagonists.
"I think for the expose to really have any resounding impact as a story we need to see how the story ends.  If Blockstream crashes and burns.. or bitcoin implodes while other cryptos take off -- then there's a story with a crazy ending there.

I can't understand your post. Is English your native language? Have get power? Gavin is an asshole? No he's not.
"WSJ doesn't have any credibility, not really. Nor do any of the other big media. This is even documented in the book ""the manufacture of consent"" by noam chomsky and is one of the most supported theories in social science. So even in the sciences it doesn't have any credibility.

With regular /people/ though, i guess it holds some credibility, sadly enough. If they really knew what was going on they would give more credence to ""a random conspiracy nut"" on medium or steemit... Or just give no credence to anything, but simply stand for things you have researched yourself. It's a sad fact in this world unfortunately."
"I don't trust the WSJ.  Haven't since it was bought by Murdock.  Or the New York Times, or Washington Post, since ever.  These are all establishment media.  So they probably won't print a story like this unless the powers that be give the message. (But there are factions, so there is a chance.)

It would probably be best to wait until Bitcoin Cash is supported by sufficient infrastructure to handle the increased volume of activity that such a story might provoke.  For the US this means, as a minimum, full support of BCH by Coinbase and Bitpay.  Hopefully this will be in place next month."
"Well actually yes. You underestimate how diligent good investors are. They will know more than 99% of the investors here.

Buffet was right,  it's a ponzi scheme. The fundamentals are absolutely solid,  but it's the crooked exchanges and companies that will ruin investor confidence.

"They have been able to limit block size to 1mb.  That alone has made it slow and expensive, enough to drive away billions to other coins.

Meanwhile, we have other banker coin that is pushed and hawked.

Nothing good has come from Blockstream's involvement in Bitcoin.  The owners/directors of Blockstream vowed to crush Bitcoin.  Since their involvement, development has been hamstrung.  Promises like LN are always 18 months away.

The folks who own Blockstream are the same people that can crash an economy and then get trillion dollar bailouts.  Bitcoin presented a real threat.  And it still is, but now it is in civil war.

"> Apart from employing a few of the Bitcoin Core software maintainers, what power does Blockchain have?

Their threats to change POW to scare miners into compliance.

That's all good and peachy. Even tho only 25% of commits come from Blockstream employees, 100% of what commits gets accepted, is decided and controlled by Blockstream. It's not because they only contribute 1/4 that they don't own it, they always have the last word for every commit. That's why many of the best core devs left for other projects.

Edit: comment above was edited. Yes bitcoin cash is a derivative work of the original bitcoin so it is more akin to the original vision of the creators of bitcoin. It is less derived from the original bitcoin as core's current version wich added segwit. Basically the only thing changed from the original bitcoin is the blocksize. it was upped to 8mb."

No, I wasn't doing anything as observed by Clinton supporters. I have my own eyes and ears. 
Oh bravo. Did it take you long to come up with that?
"You were singling out what the American's Trump voters we're doing as observed by the Clinton supporters.  Reddit sponsors the DNC.  It is a ""liberal"" (what does that mean anymore) media site.


All of Reddit is subjective to the proof-of-sockpuppet algorithm.  To trust any ""decentralization"" that comes from Reddit is foolish."
"Too bad you are missing your brain.
"
"Yea.. you admit yourself that it's backwards compatible, but you bury it deep enough that it's confusing yourself: A legacy node would not relay the blocks if it was deemed invalid. A SegWit txs is understood and accepted as a valid txs on the legacy network, period. This is not something for debate, it's a fact. Plenty of legacy nodes out there that attest to that.


You can phrase everything in highly conspiratorial terms, like ""51% attack""... or you can accept that the majority of users wanted SegWit. Those who did not, went their own way. This is again fact - The majority of users wanted SegWit activated. After you accept this fact, which might be difficult, I'm sure you'll argue that we are all brainwashed by Blockstream for wanting off-chain scaling and to keep the blocks as small as possible. Alternatively, you could much more simply accept that you are part of a minority who disagrees. And whether that's because you can truly see things more clearly, it's all still very experimental at this point so perhaps you do, or simply because you like to play contrarian is completely irrelevant. Big blocks are the minority, end of story.

Just like the majority of voters wanted Trump, not my personal preference but I accept it, I think it'd be great if you could just accept what the majority wanted and do your own thing. The good thing about blockchains is that you can fork and go your own way. Not so easy in politics/countries.
