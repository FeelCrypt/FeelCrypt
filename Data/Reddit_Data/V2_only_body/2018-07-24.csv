That's more of a parenting issue, IMO. I don't see many kids randomly ordering new video game systems from amazon.com over their parents' wishes even though it would be much easier for them to do that using a parent's credit card or a prepaid card than it would be to acquire Bitcoin and figure out how to use TOR, etc.
"Actually what you said was ""Making illegal activity safe by engaging in illegal activity does not make the action righteous or legal"".

You heavily implied righteousness and legality are the same. Since you did not state that the ""illegal activity"" was not righteous, merely that it was illegal. 

Whatever ""illegal activity"" you are talking about in this context is illegal, that is correct. However that does not make it the opposite of righteous. Which is entirely implied by your statement. So yes... you did equate the two, as you automatically state something illegal must not be righteous.

Cherrypicking doesn't make anything illegal legal. Obviously."

"> George Jung trafficked a lot more cocaine than 200M, so maybe you'll see Ross only get 20 years like he did.

He made the mistake of going to a public library and accessing the site which is where he was arrested

"> Also, the drug industry harms far more than just those who use drugs.

Yes, but those crimes (murder, for example) are crimes in their own right, and I don't believe Ross was convicted or even charged with many/most of them. They just dropped the murder for hire charges, so his sentence shouldn't reflect that activity in any case."
It disappeared from their accounts. They thought there was money and assets in their accounts when there was not. I'm not saying he performed magic.

You truly are a brainwashed idiot. If those ""drugs"" weren't so massively illegal their price would be cheaper and the CIA wouldn't be able to fund their black budget projects with the money gained from heroin sales.

Your info is badly outdated. Calling all drugs poison and banned for a reason clearly indicates your incompetence. For starters, go research DMT. Your body produces it naturally during your sleep and yet it is schedule one illegal substance in USSA. And you go as far as to call it a poison and banned for a reason?! Give me a break, you must be hallucinating yourself. If there was a legal way for acquiring those substances then there would be no ""people killed every year in Mexico"". You want to play the blame game then do it right and don't just end where it fits your argument."

I believe they caught him on camera, after leaving his account open at a public library? Or left his laptop at a Denny’s or something? I don’t care enough to look it up but sounds familiar. He’s smart, but not smarter than an entire task force waiting for you to slip. 
"> You want to tell that to the families of the dead people who have been ODing off fentanyl laced heroin lately?

Two things. First legalizing drugs leads to less ODing (see Portugal) as the product becomes more standardized. So when you put people in jail and criminalize drugs you sentence more families to suffer lost loved ones.

Secondly you believe your a victim if your family member does something you don't like and dies from it? Suffering, yes but not the vicim. The dead person is the victim. There's absolutely nothing that couldn't be banned with that logic. "
"this analogy appears to be missing the point entirely.  where is this conversation going and far more importantly why should I care?

"If someone sells your family member heroin laced with fentanyl and he dies, believe me you will realize you and him were both victims. 

I'm not advocating against legalization, the drug war needs an overhaul, but there's a difference between a junkie going out to buy drugs and a 14 year old kid going online and sending shit to his mailbox. Easily access dangerous drugs is not what the gov't wants. "

Just too bad the crypto community sides with a drug trafficker because he used their internet money.
Cool story, bro.
Actually he made the mistake of using an email containing his real name. Can't remember if it was to register a website or sign up to a forum maybe. One little slip up before Silk Road was off the ground is all it took.
Sure, you could argue those too. 
I'm not arguing the merits of DNMs vs street dealers. This is almost an entirely separate conversation. I'm just saying that there could be a valid argument in that running a large scale drug market is harming people. My actual position on this whole debate is that I agree Ross should not have got the sentence he had, and if I could make the rules up I'd have it all regulated. I'm also greatly appreciative that Ross started this new age of online trading and owe him a lot :) I don't think it's Ross' fault at all that people are being harmed by the drug trade, I think it's the government's fault.
These are the words of wisdom for most people commenting on this post

Yes it does. Illegality is suppose to be based off a common set of acceptable behavior. If significant portions of your population are engaging in something illegal (that has no victim) that thing likely shouldn't be illegal. 

You shouldn't have gotten life for running a trucking company that sometimes carried liquor in 1927. You shouldn't get life for running a website that sometimes facilitated dime bags sales in 2017.

"Not today's value, but when the complaint was filed in 2013.  Your argument still partially stands because there was huge price growth during that time, but it is likewise argued that SilkRoad drove that price increase.  After it closed, bitcoin collapsed.  

When SR started it went as low as a $1.  When Ross was arrested it was topping $300 and very shortly after went to over 1k.  We can reasonably assume that SR's business increased as time went on and the bulk of the transactions were when bitcoin's pricing was higher as opposed to lower.  I would be interested to know a better estimate of total amounts.

All this said, George Jung trafficked a lot more cocaine than 200M, so maybe you'll see Ross only get 20 years like he did.

The complaint published when Ulbricht was arrested included information the FBI gained from a system image of the Silk Road server collected on 23 July 2013. It noted that, ""From February 6, 2011 to July 23, 2013 there were approximately 1,229,465 transactions completed on the site. The total revenue generated from these sales was 9,519,664 Bitcoins, and the total commissions collected by Silk Road from the sales amounted to 614,305 Bitcoins. These figures are equivalent to roughly $1.2 billion in revenue and $79.8 million in commissions, at current Bitcoin exchange rates..."", according to the **September 2013 complaint**"

If El Chapo is rotting behind bars, I have no idea why DPR wouldn't either.

Justice Brennan, writing as part of the majority opinion on Furman, argued that a punishment must be applied consistently and be proportionate to the crime. Not everyone agrees with that interpretation, but it's not foreign to discussion of the 8th Amendment. Two life sentences and, I believe, mostly solitary confinement for running a website where people could buy and sell drugs that harmed only themselves seems disproportionate in the extreme.
He ran the largest drug black market in the world. Made billions. Life sentence seems reasonable. I'm not sure why some in the btc community feel the need to defend criminals. What he did was clearly against the law and he's paying for it. DPR knew what he was getting into when he started and chose to do it anyways. Didn't work out for him. Oh well.
Who are his victims, though?  To put someone in prison for life, I would think that he must have really hurt people.  He got a heavier sentence than Madoff, who made billions of dollars, including people's life savings disappear...spending a substantial portion of it on himself.  Ross Ulbricht ran a website which made it easier for people to buy and sell drugs without meeting in person.

You moron, he saved lives. Have you got any idea how dangerous is to buy drugs on the street? You never know what you are really getting and it could be fatal. At least if you're buying from an online shop there are countless reviews and a reputation system. Also, drugs were just part of the merchandise you could buy from SR. There were also totally legal stuff such as clothes, not even counterfeit clothes. The only thing truly criminal about this case is the fact that the feds confiscated money even from accounts that used SR for buying solely the legal goods.

And what if making said activity illegal does not eliminate or reduce it much, it just pushes it underground where it is impossible to regulate? See: Prohibition, the consequences of prohibition on crime, and its repeal and those consequences on crime. I'm amazed that we have to revisit this lesson more than once, actually.
