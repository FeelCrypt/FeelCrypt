No, but downvoted much. :)
"I was always ok with a compromise -- segwit for EC or similar...

Compromise is when you accept something you don't ""find reasonable"" for something you want.  However honestly the most basic engineering analysis would tell anyone that > 1mb per 10 minutes is trivial for today's networks even in countries with marginal connectivity.  The Avg Web page is > 2mb. And my work showing that the network self-regulates is uncontested. 

Everyone isnt always correct. There are ""experts"" who deny human assisted global warming.  Sometimes you need to stop listening to the so called ""experts"" and do a basic gut check evaluation yourself."
"I agree, why do we need to introduce extra elements (hubs) to already functioning network with nodes and miners? The second layer solution such as lightning could be possibly integrated on the current network by integrating the proposed hub responsibilities to nodes and miners instead.


I brainstormed more in detail about that in this comprehensive writeup.


/r/btc/comments/6vj47c/bitcoin_huh_wtf_is_going_on_should_we_scale_you

EDIT: The important take-away is that the off-chain scaling solution via Bitcoin Core SegWit’s lightning network diminishes distributed and immutable network properties. It replaces bitcoin’s peer-to-peer network with a two-layer institution-to-institution network and peer-to-hub-to-peer second layer solution.
"
What if the miner doesn't give a fuck about one of the networks or see's it as an impostor , should he still want to ensure it's hash rate stays stable?

"Fast internet connection on my end. I'm not alone, a claim that can be tested by using the search function, for example:

https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/search?q=bitcoin+core+slow&restrict_sr=on

Theory of scaling is well and good, but we have clear evidence that users stop setting up or using nodes at some point because the volume of transactions makes running a node too laborious.

Newbies wanting to run Bitcoin Core (the most secure and private option) are routinely told to use a light wallet. This wasn't always the case, and points to a troubling trend. And that trend is users trusting third parties over time, and the dependent culture that spawns. Worse, experienced users eventually abandon the full node idea when it becomes clear they'll have to routinely wait hours to access their wallets.

Again, this isn't right or wrong - it's a matter of tradeoffs. And the tradeoff is clear. You can scale or you can promote censorship-resistance, but doing both is not easy and won't come about by adjusting a constant.

I would be more optimistic if I saw a concerted effort by the Bitcoin Cash team to make node syncing work way faster than it does now. But that doesn't even seem to be an area anyone I've talked to on the Bitcoin Cash side cares about."
"I read somewhere that he bought Ethereum, can't find it though.   If he sold his bitcoins for $340 (the price when he put out his blog post) and bought Ethereum at $10 then he is way ahead.

You don't usually invest in a company when you start working there unless you are a founder, so I doubt he invested money in R3."
"In other words quit. He's no longer invested in bitcoin.

Peter Tod and Grwg Maxwell don't seem to be either. It looks to me like they're being paid to change the bitcoin rules. "
"An interesting and related note;

If you have a look at the recent emergence of ""Fintech Banks"", over the years they mostly slowly get bought out by a Big Bank, co-opted and then suddenly their ""Fintech"" ideals and advancements suddenly seem to die, or stagnate to the point where they might as well be dead.

Copy/paste to Bitcoin."
Do you know for a fact  he sold *all* his Bitcoin? Also, R3 is a steady paycheck and free from toxic trolls, such as yourself. I'd probably have done the same in his situation.
Yeah it would super awesome!
"That's double speak for rational politics.

Ultimately it requires censorship because you're not allowed to discuss the technical trade offs if they don't suite your agenda.

You make rules on the IRC chat like hard fork proposals are off topic. And then objectivity apply the rule."
I wonder why?
This thread is telling of him. I respect mike hearn a lot now too
"Not sure why being down voted. I recall it being close to $600 then crashing.

Mike gave up, lots of us did not. Selling out literally ensures your don't have a dog in the race. Having him on team would have added support the effort to increase native on chain capacity.

While I agree with everything Mike did even quitting BS/Core it was the selling his BTC and leaving was an emotional mistake."
Simple. If you're never moving value for others the block reward is worthless. Bitcoin's value is tied to its utility. Degrade its utility and you degrade its value.
i believe you're old enough to remember the Mystery Miner?  he mined a continuous series of 0 tx blocks for months, and this as a solo miner.  ultimately, he just disappeared.  funny how that is.
"> Centralization pressures on the network increase as transaction volume increases.

Moore's law is our friend.
Watch the recent Future of Bitcoin conference talk by Craig Wright."
"First off, my node and your node are not relevant nodes, as you and I are not market movers.  The nodes that are relevant are economic nodes - nodes with market impact.

>That's not the message I'm trying to convey. Centralization pressures on the network *increase* as transaction volume increases.

Yes but the pool of interested users also increases, and the price of hardware expressed in Bitcoin decreases, so we can therefore expect to see *more* economic nodes. 

This has been true throughout Bitcoins history."
"Processing a few (4?) days in an hour is 400tx/sec, or 5 sec/block. This is indeed quite slow and indicates a serious bandwidth limitation, though still in no way an argument to limit throughput to 4/sec.

I get around 0.3ms/tx on 4 cores/16gb with version 13.2."
"1. Tremendous. Ed25519 is blazingly fast. This would make verifying transactions much faster. 
2. In code it's easy. But you really need a hardfork. Also, older wallets wouldn't be able to read and verify these new transactions, which will use a different signature format. 
3. Not extensive, but pros: speed, smaller transaction size. Cons: hard fork, old wallets cannot verify new transactions, ed25519 is slightly less proven in practice "
"Did it harm anyone?  
It harms only if the blocks are full all the time.  
Easy protection against that is to just increase the size if they're full and so the transactions get picked up by the next block(s). 
In the long the miners producing empty blocks only harms them self by losing transaction fees.  
The cost vs benefits are much higher the higher the value is."
"You know I think we just solved the spam problem.

You just need micro-transactions to work. The more you ""broadcast"" the more expensive it is. It's the only real way to do ""push"" content on a pull network without externalizing to someone's detriment (like the power costs of running spam filters, nothing is free)."
">**Miners** are motivated to include transactions

Miners are motivated but an individual miner is not. It's essentially a [Tragedy of the Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons) example where *ALL* partitipants are acting for the common good.  Not a single participant overgrazes their cows. Why?  "
"> Miners are motivated to include transactions not just to collect fees but also to increase utility and thereby the value of their minted coins.

And therein lies the problem.

First, miners lose about 50% on their hardware investment every six months (as hash rate doubles in that period), making this anything but a long-term investment. The hash rate shenanigans taking place on Bitcoin Cash should dissuade anyone of the belief that miners in general have the best long-term interest of the network in mind.

Second, implicit in your response is that the block subsidy exists to begin with. And that's a function of two things: (1) the face value of the subsidy; and (2) the exchange rate. I'm sure some enlightened miners will notice the long-term correlation between (2) and profitability, but the rapid obsolescence of equipment means they might not even be around next year to reap the benefits. And the pernicious thing about (1) is that it leads down the path of infinite inflation.

I know, a miner can be compensated by either small blocks paying high fees or big blocks paying small fees. But banking the entire success of the system on high transaction volume sets the entire economy on a path toward centralization of nodes.

All of these things are merely tradeoffs - none of them are inherently good or bad. But to suggest there's anything not that hard about the choices to be made seems simplistic."
Also, volume. The more we can scale and the more volume we can process in transactions, the more minimal fees will be per person.
This guy does game theory.
Peter Todd has always had a malicious air about him.
haha. It has now 
[deleted]
"Both, although the network experiencing the worst effects is likely to be Bitcoin Cash.

Either way, hash rate stability should be in  the long term best interest of any miner. Yet the network offers a way to cheat. When faced with the choice, at least some miners are taking short term profits for the win."
Agreed!
Bitcoin would finally be moving forward BIG time :)
LukeJr will finalize this soon with a SMALL PoW change.
Mike Hearn then went on to sell all his Bitcoin for $300 and work for R3, a failed attempted at at a complicated and expensive replacement for a wire transfer.

It's still a hard fork. Not that it matters.
"> Let's assume ""centralization of nodes"" is somehow relevant (I'd say only miner-centralization but I'll go with you here). I do not understand the notion that this would somehow decrease with more transaction volume.

That's not the message I'm trying to convey. Centralization pressures on the network *increase* as transaction volume increases.

I'm not sure about your claim that a ""cheap"" laptop can trivially process 1000s of transactions (per second?). Do the math. My ""cheap"" laptop takes one hour to process a few days worth of transactions when restarted, and days to spin up from scratch, half of which is consumed processing just the last year's worth of nearly full 1 MB blocks.

Is there some study or benchmark you're referring to?

"**EdDSA**

In public-key cryptography, Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA) is a digital signature scheme using a variant of Schnorr signature based on Twisted Edwards curves. It is designed to be faster than existing digital signature schemes without sacrificing security. It was developed by a team including Daniel J. Bernstein, Niels Duif, Tanja Lange, Peter Schwabe, and Bo-Yin Yang. The reference implementation is public domain software.

Jeff doesn't like BCH unfortunately.
Has it occurred to anyone that Peter Todd is the Dwight Schrute of Bitcoin.
"This isn't all that hard.

Miners are motivated to include transactions not just  to collect fees but also to increase utility and thereby the value of their minted coins.

That said, a *zero*-fee environment is long gone as most miners were using minimum fees long before blocks were full, as they were flooding the network and thereby *decreasing* utility."
Blockstream manufactured the problem that they're trying to solve. They're like a door-to-door vacuum salesman that barges into your home and spills dirt all over your floor, then cleans it up with their patented vacuum.
"I forget the exact day of the infamous Hearn rage-quit, but I'd love to see the gains he's missed out on since then.

No respect for Mike, he openly condemned Bitcoin, stating its a failed experiment and that he sold all his Bitcoin. Then he went to R3 which failed. Haha schadenfreude 
"Put it on the blockchain.

Luke et. al will be forced to fork off."
"Mike poses another question in the same message one paragraph up:

> Likewise, miners have all kinds of perverse incentives in theory that don't seem to happen in practice. Like, why do miners include any transactions at all?

Before deciding to work on a system that boils down to a complicated and expensive replacement for Visa, it might be worth thinking about what should motivate a miner to include transactions in a block at all in a zero-fee environment."
Correct. Can't believe core chainers don't see where this is going.

"""If Gavin decides to lift the cap, I guess you [P. Todd] and Gregory could create a separate alt-coin that has hard block size caps  and see how things play out over the long term."" - M. Hearn"
"Hey, I'm also interested on this one from Mike Hearn:

>But we're not going to stop optimizing the software. Removing the block cap means a hard fork, and once we decided to do that we may as well throw in some ""no brainer"" upgrades as well, like supporting ed25519 which is orders of magnitude faster than ECDSA+secp256k1. Then a single strong machine can go up to hundreds of thousands of transactions per second."
Holy shit...Peter Todd is corrupted to the core...
"I don't think the Tragedy of the Commons harms the theory that much.

Even for a 1% miner, not including transactions would have a slight negative effect on utility.

And the volatile value of bitcoin is by far its biggest variable in its revenue whereas the cost of including transactions is negligible. "
"**Tragedy of the commons**

The tragedy of the commons is an economic theory of a situation within a shared-resource system where individual users acting independently according to their own self-interest behave contrary to the common good of all users by depleting or spoiling that resource through their collective action. The concept and name originate in an essay written in 1833 by the Victorian economist William Forster Lloyd, who used a hypothetical example of the effects of unregulated grazing on common land (then colloquially called ""the commons"") in the British Isles. The concept became widely known over a century later due to an article written by the ecologist Garrett Hardin in 1968. In this context, commons is taken to mean any shared and unregulated resource such as atmosphere, oceans, rivers, fish stocks, or even an office refrigerator.

"> I know, a miner can be compensated by either small blocks paying high fees or big blocks paying small fees. But banking the entire success of the system on high transaction volume sets the entire economy on a path toward centralization of nodes.

Let's assume ""centralization of nodes"" is somehow relevant (I'd say only miner-centralization but I'll go with you here). I do not understand the notion that this would somehow *decrease* with more transaction volume.

With minimum fees, people don't make flooding transactions, and transactions simply grow with users. If we have 10x as much volume, and thus 10x as many users, do you really believe their would be *less* full nodes?

We currently process 3 tx/sec, where my cheap laptop could *trivially* process 1000s. Even if a handful of Pi's are no longer viable, how on earth would 10x more users result in *less* full nodes? "

Just hard fork to 60 second block times and you've scaled by 10x. I own about 40 different alts. 10 min block time is like showing off a dial-up 56 kbps internet connection in 2017.
"Lightning Network increases efficiency, it increases privacy, and it also removed the need to wait for multiple  confirmations to be assured that someone can't double spend. This sub is just filled with FUD over it because it's complicated to understand and people would rather fear monger. 

While the blockchain can scale beyond 1 MB blocks it still needs increases in efficiency like LN otherwise it can scale to meet the demand of tomorrow (eg thousands of transactions per second) as a distributed network just isn't capable of scaling to the capacity achieved through a semi distributed network. 

Lightning Network doesn't hurt the immutable properties of Bitcoin as LN is literally a series of smart contracts backed and enforced by the Bitcoin blockchain.

 It's just more efficient to say that instead of me sending you 100 Bitcoin transactions each onchain that I instead write you 100 contracts we both sign to send you Bitcoin with each subsequent contract canceling out the previous and then one of us only broadcast the last of those series of contracts onchain resulting in only 2 onchain transactions (one to close to payment channel and one to open it) rather than 100 onchain transactions.

That said. Yes to second layer solutions. Only, let's not hold back the first layer to make them happen. If LN's only advantage is bc the blockchain is full, then it has no advantage. But if it provides a meaningful benefit anyways, then there's no reason it can't rest on top of a healthy blockchain, letting consumers choose what's best for their needs. "
