"I've had Bitcoin since 2013, I remember the super low fees due to minimal adoption, but thanks for assuming otherwise?
Again, I'm just chuckling at the complaint of paying money to get access to your money when the system is built on the idea of paying money to transfer your money.

And yes, I get it, the fees are supposed to be smaller, but it's still funny to me."
And I'm all for the cryptocause, I more thought complaining about it costing money to use your money was funny in light of a system that is designed to function being funded by transaction fees.
You don’t need cash to use fiat
"I’m loving all the bank apologists posting in this thread. 

Sorry, old-school legacy backwoods finance guys. 

Crypto is coming to eat your lunch, whether you like it or not. Three dollar fees for someone to access their own money, whether it’s their bank or not, will soon be history. 

Picture an international currency that nobody has to trade for a local currency when they travel overseas. Nobody needs permission to get access to it. They can carry as much as they want, anywhere they want.  And they can access it anytime, without anyone’s permission.

Fees to send money anywhere on the planet, from a penny to $20 million will cost less than a few cents. And take less than 10 minutes.  No bank or swift system can possibly do that.

You can cling tightly to your bank if you like. Go down with the ship guys. You know better than us.  Cuz you’re educated in finance and stuff!"
"They could probably keep the private key of the paper wallet printed out, right.

Should be more known you *need* to transfer them onto another wallet."
"Banks make money by lending out a fraction of the money deposited with them. ATMs, in theory, attract more people to deposit with them.

In practice, small accounts actually lose them money since the paycheck-to-mouth crowd doesn't deposit enough to be worth serving. That's why most banks waive fees for large accounts and charge fees for small accounts.

Example: https://www.wellsfargo.com/investing/portfolio-welcome/"
Regardless of whether an ATM is a business that needs to charge for services, people deserve better. They deserve access to their own money without having to pay anyone to get it. This is why Bitcoin was created. 
In the UK, all ATM’s are free to use - apart from those at Welcome Break (roadside services on motorways). Your bank pays a small fee no-matter who owns the ATM.
You know the ATMs with fees are run by private companies? Why shouldn’t they be allowed to charge a fee for their service?
Is this a bad thing?

"Most of what you said is dishonest nonsense, however this is interesting:

> Yeah, otherwise classes would be classes forever, and people born from rich people would always rule over people born from poor people.

This is a common misconception. Typically there is an inter-generational change in economic behaviour. Riches are often earned by very hardworking, driven and economically rationally people. When those riches are passed down, the children typically have a very different upbringing and a very different relationship to earning, building and maintaining wealth. It's common to see those children quickly burn through their inheritance: this money finds its way back into the general economy and the whole cycle may continue again a few generations later.

^ the above comment is more for anyone else who might be reading. It's something to think about and consider. It makes sense when you consider the kind of incentives and environments that create driven, economically rational people and what kinds of incentives are created by large inheritances and silver-spoon upbringings.

I'm dropping out of the conversation now Dunedune. I see no value in continuing it with you."
"> I think someone is testing their upvote botnet by spamming this shitty content. Mods, please. Stop this nonsense.

100% agree. This entire thread is full of people who literally seem to love banks. Half the comments are smart ass insults towards crypto people for thinking their system is better.  

I don’t know a single person on the planet who loves Banks this much. This is not normal posting. Not normal voting. And not regular people.   

Edit:  it’s possible this thread got so many up votes that some of the finance bros on Reddit saw it and hopped in here to talk shit, because they still think crypto is lame and banks are super awesome.

I checked post history of a bunch of them and most are just deeply entrenched in the old-school legacy financial system. Either still in school, or some finance career. That entire industry is still full of backwards thinking overconfident tools.

>Also, my bank actually reimburses me for these atm fees. So the private companies who own the atms are just paid by my bank.

why wouldn’t they just transfer BTC bought with $ for XMR and then XMR for BTC? or even simpler, just buy XMR using $, and transfer that XMR to BTC? it is provably safer than a “mixer.”"
This should be the top upvoted comment, but we’ve got a bunch of bank apologists in here trying to make sure banks are defended and voting their own shit to the top.
"Food for thought for people who think that employment laws help employees:

One of the big reasons you are witnessing a mass replacement of humans with machines/automated systems, is because humans, via law, have been made extremely undesirable to hire. The employer has a huge list of obligations they must adhere to, the employer is sometimes forced to give the employee more than they would otherwise give and the consequences to the employer of getting something wrong could be very large: IE large fines or timely and expensive court cases.

There are other reasons for this replacement too, but the above is surely a big one."
It’s supposed to be less than a penny dude.  I realize you were probably raised in the post fork bitcoin era, but fees used to be tiny.
Many online banks have like $1 minimums and cover fees. If you think $1 is the 1% I'm guessing you went all in on crypto during last December.
I have common sense. Unless you think that everything should be done for free.

"> You can put a ""promoter of forced resource redistribution"" tag on me, I don't mind at all. Only that somehow the likes of you think resource redistribution is enforced by violence - it's not - you are simply being taxed on your income if you have a job. 

You contradicted yourself within the same sentence. ""[Not] enforced by violence"" followed by... ""taxed on your income if you have a job"". What do you think happens if you don't pay your taxes? You get a letter! What happens if you ignore the letter? You get a knock at the door. What happens if you refuse to let the people knocking in? Eventually they will break in. What happens if you try to stop those people breaking in and stop them from taking your stuff or taking you away? They will use violence? What happens if you continue to defend yourself and your property? It could easily end up with an armed response against you which could easily end up with you lying dead on the floor. At the very least you can expect to be physical controlled and your will probably be injured.

Be honest about what it is you are promoting.

Also: this isn't only done to you if you have a job. All around Europe, the US and the rest of the world people are stolen from, not just from their income but:

* Via forced regular payments to a local government organisation related to their home.
* When they pay for goods and services. The shop owner is forced to charge you extra. Non-compliance with the threats are extreme, so the shop owners will usually obey and you will be ultimately forced to pay this extra, non-voluntary, amount.
* Via inflation: a covert form of tax. Look into what has happened to people in Europe and the US when they have attempted to setup alternative currencies which do not have inflation or they have less inflation. For example the liberty dollar. These people get robbed or caged by the state. One reason Bitcoin's design has been so successful, is for the first time we have an alternative money system which cannot be easily shutdown by the state.

Even if you were **only** getting robbed by working. In the mind of what person, does this suddenly mean there is not threat of violence being employed?

If I make a rule that you can only walk down a given street (one that I do not own) wearing blue clothes and if you disobey I will violently attack you... would you say that I am not enforcing my rule using violence because people could choose to not go down the road or they could choose to wear blue?

> If you don't want to be part of the society and earn money, that's fine, no one is going to ask you for money. Your taxes will be 0.00$.

*If you don't want to be a part of this neighbourhood and run your business here, that's fine, no one is going to ask you for your money. The local mafia will not take that 10% cut from you. The boys wont come after you. You are free to leave.*

> Ah yeah, when the majority of the benefit of businesses go to their owners instead of their employees. 

You want that business owners buildings?

You want their money?

You want to threaten them with violence to give up their property?

> Yeah, those people that were born in a rich family, continued to profit from said businesses/factories, and never worked much in their life. 

You want the inheritance of both peaceful and non-peaceful people? Even though some old dying man or woman, as their dying wish, chose to leave their property to their children and grandchildren... you want that property to be forcefully taken from them under threat of extreme violence, up to and including death? Remember: death threats are what it takes: if you're not willing to go as far as death, then everyone can arm-up and shoot back whenever they are being robbed and they will know that the collectors will immediately leave and never return because they know that death is not permitted.

All of the above is the reality of what you are promoting from. If you want other people's stuff to be taken from them so it can be redistributed as per your desire or some other person's desire, you are advocating for the maintenance of a system of aggression and theft on a mass scale against peaceful people.

> Those people deserve to have 10000x the employee's income.

Why do you focus on extreme examples? You are promoting widescale theft from almost every living adult whether they employ no-one or they employ 100s of people.

I know why you likely do this: it's because you can hide behind it: you can make it seem like you *just want to steal property from the super-rich*; those people that would likely live on happily even if you stole most of their stuff. 

It's an incredibly deceptive way to frame it.

> ~~Public funding~~ [Stealing to fund government organisations] is just fine. 

FTFY

The fact that alternative phrases are invented for things which already have perfectly accurate phrases should be very telling to you and others. I don't need to invent an alternative word to describe bird feeding. I just call it bird feeding.

> It would be a disaster if everything was privatized. No public services, no roads, no army. That'd be the fastest failing nation.

I think you're wrong, but this is a whole different discussion and one which I would not have with you because you are currently showing yourself to be dishonest. If you were honest you would straight up accept that you promote theft, but you would make your case for *why you think this forced taking of other people's property is justified or necessary*. But because you are dishonest and/or you have no back-bone you will not admit it."

Harrison Bergeron lived in a perfectly egalitarian society. 
"> egalitarian

*I'm an appearance egalitarian: it's unfair that some people are more pretty than others. I promote breaking the faces of attractive people and stealing funds from everyone to cover the make-up and cosmetic surgery costs of the uglier ones.* /s

egalitarianism is not about egalitarianism in general. It's just about resource egalitarianism.

I think ""egalitarians"" should just call themselves ""promoters of forced property redistribution"". Doesn't have quite the same ring to it, does it though.

Personally I don't care that some people are vastly more rich than me. So long as they acquired their wealth honesty, good on them. I hope they have fun.

What I do care about is poverty: people suffering because they aren't getting their basic needs met. I do not agree with socialists that large scale theft is the solution. Empirically I know it not to be the solution. Socialists are organising large scale theft right now to end poverty, yet poverty has not been ended: not even close. In-fact I see signs all around me that vast numbers of people are impoverished and things may be getting worse. Solving poverty is a hard task and I have many ideas on how to go about it: none of those ideas require me to steal from another.

Stealing is wrong. There appears to be a touch of irony in people promoting theft in order ""to do good""."

">Now all you need is to spread the wealth

That sounds like a euphemism for: steal other people's stuff and hand it around.

There's a reason why people are embaressed to say the ""S"" word around here. It's because they know they are among company that largely understand that stealing is wrong and socialism is stealing.

If you want to help the poor, please don't ""help"" them with other people's stuff."

"> This is because this sub is a liberal fest mostly filled with americans

So you think this place is filled with Americans but you use the term ""liberal"" to refer to libertarians. Sounds like you don't know much about Americans. In the US, the term ""liberal"" is used (in current times) to refer to more socialist inclined people. Americans would say ""classical liberal"" if they were going to refer to libertarian-minded people.

> It's not because you're somehow more enlightened than europeans.

You assume I am American?

> Sure, call that stealing.

Of course. Or more accurately: extortion. Why would you call it anything else but that... except if you were uncomfortable with the reality of it.

You're happy for people to have their property stolen from them under threat of extreme violence, up to and including death... but you don't want to call it stealing. Why? In all probability because you have no back bone.

If you support stealing/extortion to ""help society"" then stand by it. Speak out confidently in what you support.

> I call that a functional society.

Define ""functional society"".

Do the following aspects of society created by governments and funded by theft count as functional to you:

* invading foreign lands
* bombing innocent people
* violently imposing economic sanctions on people which stop those people from getting their absolute basic needs for food, water and healthcare met
* incentivizing single mother homes which are completely dependent on state welfare (guess who these people vote for)
* creating laws and legislation which lead to market monopolies & give advantages to large corporations, while hurting small businesses.
* monopolizing certain markets by offering a ""free"" government ""service"" in that market and thus reducing the possibility of the free market providing a cheap and better alternative.
* create a fiat monetary system which covertly saps wealth from people, causes huge economic bubbles and every 30 years or so hyper inflates causing absolute economic disaster.

... a functioning society..."
"That's our reason of existance, minimising that amount onto a negligible number.

I have never paid an atm fee that is not fully reimbursed by my bank. People too ignorant to shop for a good bank are not going to understand  enough about crypto to make it a better alternative to their current arrangements.  
"My bank charges 4$ abroad. Plus 1.2% conversion fee. It feels like my bank stabs me in my back while being thousands of kilometers away from them. 

Especially 'funny' when those atm's only allow you to withdrawal like 150$ at a time."
yeaah the fee is really up to the store owners
Then you get that nice credit from your credit union for all your troubles.

Blockstream does the same. You can still move your coins if the fee isn't higher than the balance but it's not practical.

And Bitcoin ATMs are somehow better than this? Instead of charging you $3 to take out $300, they charge you $30..

This always annoyed me, how do people think the ATM got there?  Maybe there is an argument for getting your money out of one of your banks own ATMs, but as far as I know that's always free now.
"My credit union also pays all my ATM fees. SWEET ;)"
Also, Bitcoin ATMs are soooo much more expensive than $3
"It does make sense, that said if you use an ATM from your own bank usually that is free, at least thats the case with my credit union.

Though, I do think when you're only pulling out $20 and they charge you $4 that's some bullshit"
"Counter claimn to your devil's advocate post:
Real unnecessary cost in energy, maintenance initial cost etc. So it's lose lose. "
You use bitcoin ATMs to exchange currencies. That is completely different operation.
to think that bank charges are high already that they suppose to run atms for free
It's kindda different, the bitcoin you are *purchasing* from a bitcoin ATM is not your own money, right?
You don't need Bitcoin ATM to use Bitcoin
Trust me the costs are way less than 3$ per use. even 0.1 USD would make it profitble as hell.
I'm still unsure whether the meme intends to make fun of Bitcoin or credit cards. 
"I wonder why ATMs in Europe are generally free for the customer to use? 🤔 
"
They're highly inefficient when you include all the banking and monetary costs..
Wtf is this logic? Someone owns the ATM. They worked and paid for it to be installed. It’s a convenience to access your money at any point of the day when the bank is closed. The owner deserves at least some kind of payment. 
"When crypto charges you remain fees to send money, and then tells you to protect your secret key so you don't get robbed.

It in case of SIM fishing, get robbed without being able to do anything. "
I am from India and no our banks don't charge us extra everytime I go to an Atm, but there is a limit of 5 times per month for using the atm. 
No, memes are just low hanging fruit for easy karma.  Easy way to get votes from lurkers.
Imagine unironically believing that out-of-network ATMs charging you to use their services when you don't have accounts through their banks is robbery
"As a business owner of a miniature golf course. My grandpa always said it was more profitable to own an ATM instead of accepting credit card over the counter. If the customer forgot to bring cash you point them to the ATM. They're not going to get back in their car with their kids and deal with traffic just to find a free ATM.

Way less fraud if you own an ATM instead of accepting credit cards also.

A lot of local marijuana dispensaries choose to operate ATMs instead of processing credit cards."
