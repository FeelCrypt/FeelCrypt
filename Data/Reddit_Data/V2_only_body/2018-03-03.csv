"You mean after a bunch of people took out loans they couldn't afford and fucked over everyone else in 2008. Sure, the banks could've been more scrutinizing in who they handed out loans to, but that wouldn't be an issue if people didn't think they could just take out loans and never pay them off.

Capitalism is a tool that can be controlled by the people with $$$. If you do not support a service with your $$$, the service must change to be something you will support. It is baffling how people seem to think the power to manipulate corporations is out of the hands of the population of a first world country."
Governments won't allow cryptocurrencies to make banks and fiat irrelevant. The regulations will come, and as they do, the prices of cryptos that capitalized on the lack of regulation will drop. They may still be used, but they will drop none-the-less.
I remember buying a beer with BTC in 2011, great feeling.

Whatever. Spend and replace. Adoption is the only way to get to sustainable valuation anyway. So if you want to see that happen, start using it!
I hope so!
Yes it is. The real Bitcoin that actually works as currency. Bitcoin Cash. BCH. Here, now you have some. u/chaintip Yes, it's that fast and easy.
"What? Stop celebrating adoption because we should have more adoption? What kind of logic is this? 
Every step is a great achievement!"
"Explain what you mean by better and I‚Äôll do it. I saw a guy on Reddit buying a beer with Bitcoin Cash a few months ago.

That‚Äôs why I decided to do exactly the same. And here I am buying beer with Bitcoin cash.

Just tell me what I need to do to make adoption skyrocket and I‚Äôll fuckin do it."
"Celebrating adoption is one way to help get more adoption. Go buy something from a local merchant using BCH, share photo evidence, and I'll tip you too! Then, I hope you'll use the tip to buy more from that merchant with BCH.

I'll keep doing that until there's more places around here that I can spend BCH. Then, maybe when I get merchants around here to accept it, you can help me reward them too.

It's up to you. You don't have to participate in encouraging adoption. But I will. It's fun.

This is how Bitcoin started growing to begin with. Through grassroots adoption.

Here have some that you can spend yourself. Cheer up, get excited, and look for ways you can spend and replace! That's what I'm doing, anyway. u/chaintip"
"No way! Comparing BTC to gold is insulting to gold :)

First of all, I use gold all the time. My Goldmoney account is my *other* favorite ""alternative"" currency account.

Second: How can BTC go after the gold market when gold has both utility and relative price stability while BTC has neither?

Spoiler alert: It can't.

BCH is a very nice complement to gold. We don't know if it will ever reach anything like the real price stability of gold, but it sure is one heck of a good vehicle for transmitting value, even if it never achieves comparable real price stability."

Bullshit. It‚Äòs been 6 months and we are doing great. Celebrating encourages to keep going and most importantly: Posts like this inspire.
That's exactly what's happening here though. Don't be myopic.
"Let me tell you the secret: do all the fuck you can do to improve adoption.

That‚Äôs it"
Preach to the choir all you like, but it's objectively not working.
"The vast majority of people don't use BCH either though.

It's just not a great comparison because more people around the world ascribe more value to gold than to the entire crypto space, not to mention just BCH.

So let's not go knocking gold. It's still the most stable assets in value compared to all other commodities, and financial assets too.

It's also one of the most liquid and globally valued of all assets. And it's great to hold when cashflowing financial assets are excruciatingly priced like they are today.

We don't need to make like clueless Keynesians and knock gold to make the point that BCH is useful. They can both be useful in their own ways!"

Thanks for letting us know. I've added it to the [Marco Coino](https://www.coinline.co.nz/marco-coino/) BCH brick-and-mortar merchant directory.
Why did they call it bitcoin cash there? Isn't this real bitcoin?

Fantastic news, great adoption for Bitcoin! BCH, Beer me!

"It is becoming a lot easier to explain to new people that Bitton Cash is for using as cash, and Bitton Core is for using as gold.

It makes sense since people don't use gold. It isn't for people to use.

Really glad the Core team chose gold instead of Cash."

"Yeah, using it as a currency in present US Tax Law is essentially infeasible per above. I was putting up with it but after this year of taxes, I'm way less inclined. I really hope regulation comes around.

The Euro is treated as an actual currency, not a commodity/property like cryptocurrency, so completely different set of allowances and rules. And even if it was treated the same, in the worst case scenario what was your gain/loss from the time you got the Euro to the time you used it? Cryptocurrency could double or halve in value easily in a week. The Euro has never doubled or halved in value... Ever?

So the gain/loss would be neglible unless you're dealing with tens of thousands of dollars worth. This is like 2015/2016; I didn't do the legwork on the Shift card because the gains/losses would be close to a wash. If the IRS wanted to ""get"" me on it, it would be weeks of work to, at best, source under $100 of unreported gains (and probably actually a loss instead). 2017 was almost pure gains (Bitcoin went 20x!) so I definitely needed to do it right."
"I don't think you could pay me enough to do all that fucking work again, lol. All of my accountants told me the legwork I did would have cost weeks of $200+/hr work from them.

I'm an independent software engineer already; I could reverse engineer Shift's app API for a proper export and I could reimplement basis tracking from Bitcoin.tax, but the niche is still small enough I don't think there would be good return on the effort. Maybe if I went to work for Coinbase or Shift. Or hell, I could go to the ""other side"" and work as a specialist in all this shit for the IRS, lol."
Your account reeks
snooping/stalking? oh great i got fan, also where are your manners..
"Man, this shit has to stop.

If you happened to have a stack of Euro for some reason, and held it for a bit, then spent it all in Europe on some later trip, the IRS wouldn't give two shits about the capital gains, even though technically they should.  I guess to some degree it's hard to argue it should be treated like a currency not an investment when you're selling to use fiat as the currency...."
Sounds like we need to start a company together to fix this problem. 
I wonder how day traders deal with it then with thousands of trades per day. There must be a faster way 
All ships rise in high tide, no?
"> along with telling people you are paying with this with a crypto

yeah for me this is critical to asking ""do you accept Bitcoin Cash"" in the first place.  99% of the time people are going to look at you like you're crazy to be asking the question.  When you can say, ""no problem, I can pay this way instead"" then suddenly you didn't get shut down, you routed around.  It makes the first question a lot easier to get the ""no"" on because it's not a stopper."
"A lot of Americans think of Denmark as some sort of socialist paradise without realizing that it has traditionally held strongly anti-immigrant policies; when they learn this their brains explode with cognitive dissonance.

Edit: BTW I have several Danish friends and have been to many places in Denmark.  It is a lovely place and lovely people generally."
"Question for any who have used this: how many confirms / how long from the time you've sent the BCH to the card until the funds are spendable?

I'm wondering how fast it can be loaded."
I've been waiting for something to do with this shit thank God
"Cointracking.info and Bitcoin.tax has you covered there as long as you only ever bought and sold on an exchange (since that means no external basis was established). It gets more complicated if there's more than one exchange but it's doable. Almost every exchange has an export function or API that one of those sites can interact with, so it's much closer to automated.

I suspect most day traders from last year / this year are either not paying taxes properly or at all. A lot of the theory I've heard from altcoin traders that have no tax law experience is to only track when you put in money and when you took it out and pay taxes on the difference, ignoring all interim trades in between regardless of if it's USD->crypto, crypto->crypto, or crypto->USD... That also implies a like-kind set of exchanges between cryptocurrencies which definitely does not hold up to IRS scrutiny... Yeah that's all definitely not going to fly if the IRS starts giving a shit; those are all separate events that must be tracked/reported individually and the basis of each asset tracked accurately.

If you made a ton of money altcoin trading last year it behooves you to get a good accountant, especially if you used a compliant exchange. I'm confident the IRS has a direct feed of data from those guys, either on request or automatic. The reason you don't know is because I don't believe the tax law is clear enough what forms the exchanges should be filing and how for each customer, so it's literally raw data on request."
"That's the claim. If you look at how it's done, there's a good argument that it isn't a fair representation.

Either way, the point is that it's not a measure of inflation (money printing) as such."
Economically, inflation is defined as a general rise in prices, not an increase in the money supply (which can of course cause inflation).
I'm the same. They look at me with incredulity as if that can't possibly be true.
You are correct. My bad.
"Getting rid of cash is not necessary to fuck over saviors. Inflation does the trick. Digital fiat just speeds up and simplifies the process and alongside gives a state enormous power over individual

The last is the thing to watch out. Not a robbery process, robbery will continue just in other forms. Darwinism. But no one will have to resort to a System-of-Control money as Andreas described it"
That's not monetary policy, that's social policy. And in fact I agree that we should have more progressive social policy
It's currently one of the responsibilities of the government
Are you really insinuating that bitcoin cash's proponents (puppeteers even) haven't partaken in propaganda and manipulation?  Bch is the ultimate CIA project to divert attention away from the true value.
"So good monetary policy will drive the economy and society forward in a smooth way. It keeps naturally lazy people (all of us) from stagnating. Ok. 

But where are the dividends from the last hundred years of hard work? They should be absolutely massive. Not just a smartphone. We should all enjoy a work week lighter than the French, all have complete free health care, complete free unlimited education. Society can afford that.

Where did the proceeds go?"
Sounds too dystopic it is hard to believe. But anyway, too much of what governments do around the world is also too dystopic to believe. I recently found the police in USA (allegedly a free country) can legally confiscate the money they find in your possession.
It's absolutely facltual: Kenya, Cyprus, Brexit, India and Venezuela to new a few
No worries!
