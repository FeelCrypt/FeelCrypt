"Sure such aspects are important for any tech to boost it's adoption. The point on which i disagree is the condition ""sine qua none"" of that aspect regarding the extreme cases (grandmas easy access as a  goal, or nowhere), it is like if you put a goal to car designers : that must be easily driven by any teenager...We will always be driving on cars limited to max 80kmh today. 

I think that usability should be a continual improvement process in parallel and on the top of the core tech AND in the users side (we are  discussing an actual example here: http://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8gqja8/-/dyel4z9) , but cant condition/interfere with the evolution/creativity of the tech, because it will Inevitably limit them, the difference is subtile but important: there is no concurrence between the two goals. "
Oh wow I am certainly surprised to see that idiotic and definitely not repetitive response of yours 
Considering you've sent me three messages within the past hour...yeah
and until the mods of rbitcoin stop their censorship this message will stay, that' sll ther eis to it
Do you honestly think I care about you enough to even notice you replied to me? 
They're finally replying to my comments now too. Maybe he went away for a few weeks to take a spelling course. This is the most legible comment I've seen them fat finger his way to posting. 
according to reddit.com, yes it is
So you're for censorship? 
most intelligent people i know don’t spend time priding themselves on calling others stupid, speaking on behalf of others without permission, and intentionally trying to get under ones skin while talking about how easy a task it is.   I’m sorry, but all I see here is bullying and arrogance.
Nano is also a threat to core.
It's not just me. Look at your history, it's almost nothing but mindless fighting with a vast swath of people. Again, you're deflecting but the point is readily evident, you lack any sort of meaningful life. You spend every single day on reddit, all day long. Lmao, so pathetic.
And you? The guy who answers every single one of my posts in an instant here at the same reddit you're complaining about. What's your excuse idiot?
"Evade the point much? We're talking about you. Supposedly someone who was around in the early days and yet still nothing better to do that yell at people on reddit, every day, all day long. 

Me? I'm a bit of a reddit addict, not a millionaire and am dealing with recovering from an injury that limits my mobility currently. Plus it's extremely tempting to respond to comments, especially those of serial liars who's claims don't line up with reality in the slightest.

What's *your* excuse, Mr Early Adopter?"
"Lol. You're doing it again! 

I don't think you're capable of recognizing your tendency to jump to conclusions to produce straw men. "
if you're censored then you'd be banned, not down voted 
poor fuckin guy lol
seems you failed to heed your own advice my friend
"> It's effectively censorship

Yet we still see them, so clearly not censored. If you can see them then it is literally not censored."
I mean bitcoin.com shits on bitcoin core. Everyone has their opinion. That site can do what they please. Just dont go to it. 
Says who? This echo chamber? This is the only place I’ve ever heard this claim. The rest of the world has already agreed which is bitcoin(BTC). I mean I had no qualms with BCH until I visited this sub and the petty tribalism. It’s not even a bad coin. It’s pretty fast and cheap txn-wise and could have a decent future but the way this sub and Ver represent it just turns so many off and is why so many have grown to mocking it. It’s the community that is giving it this moniker in the crypto space and it’s just sad as it’s self inflicted 
">bitcoin.com shits on bitcoin core

Not to the extent coincall has done too bch. But hey, we see it differently. No sense arguing about it. "
I was merely giving him an option that would lead to him not needing to tell people what to do on a free forum like reddit. Especially considering how many people in this subreddit are quick to label everything they disagree with as a troll. Let's be better than r/bitcoin, shall we?
"If you're limited in your ability to post and respond, that's censorship.

Also, hiding comments is also a partial form of censorship."
"> Not to the extent coincall has done too bch.

Bullshit. Bitcoin.com lies and manipulates. Coincall is doing the opposite, preventing people from being scammed by the likes of Roger.

Why are you on reddit so much if you're a multi-multi-millionaire as you claim to be? Is it because you're actually a big phony?"
"I’m with you, trust me.  Can’t stand the arrogant and immature troll labeling.  It’s quite bizarre to be honest. Sadly, social media and the internet creates a platform for this to flourish.  Humans find comfort in the masses and so we latch onto an idea or opposition to an idea, and quickly get blinded to the truth... which is that nothing is black and white and simple two sided argument.   Same thing with politics.  Many of the same tactics conservatives use to generalize liberals are found in this lovely crypto debate.    The worst part is it’s near impossible to debate or argue with any hope of influencing, teaching or even learning from others, as stubborness and name calling fuels the majority to focus on the wrong things.

It’s sad where civilization is headed.  I wish we could just admit and embrace that we dont have all the answers ..  the more we listen and question our own beliefs, the faster we will progress in any meaningful way.  

Clearly satoshi didn’t have all the answers.  He had amazing solutions and glimpses into the future state, many of which have shown to be true.  But just like anything in this world, there is no one right way to do anything .  And no single person or book or creed or religion should ever be followed without frequent checks and revisions and adaptations and pause as we learn and eventually become smarter than the original idea and creator.   Unfortunately, we are not very good at stepping in another’s shoes and fully understanding  life from a different perspective.  We aren’t good with conflict.  Instead of listening, we demand others to listen to us, or resort to stereotyping and labeling.   

Glad to be living in such exciting times.  This isn’t about being right or wrong or right to a name.  No one is entitled to shit.  Let’s have many coins.   Spending every waking minute comparing bch to bitcoin is absurd.  The internet can make insignificant events feel much more important than they are.  And this is one of them.  No one gives a shit about bch being the real bitcoin.   No one is losing sleep over the atrocities this evil group called core has committed.    If anything, the world will never know of this so called crisis, and let’s hope so!   "
"It's *not* the exact opposite. It's just that instead of the mods handling it, the users act like vigilantes and hide the comments and make it virtually impossible to respond to attacks because negative karma makes you have to wait 10 minutes to post a new comment, which is incredibly frustrating and **is without a doubt a form of censorship** (I know because I'm a victim of these downvote brigades and even as I write this comment, I know that I have to wait another 8 or so minutes to submit because I just responded to another of your comments. How is this fair?

In terms of the bot, as it relates to the behavior described above, how is the bot helpful for genuine readers? Again, all it shows is that the person is likely not on the BCH bandwagon and has lost their karma and ability to post often as a result."
It's wrong that BCash skeptics are downvoted to oblivion? Yeah, certainly no evidence of that... /s
Having low karma means you have to wait several minutes before posting an additional comment and downvoted comments are hidden. It's effectively censorship.
I enjoy yanking your chain
It still amazes me /btc downvotes Bitcoin supporters
"Just because a comment is anti-BCH doesn't mean it's automatically downvoted. Informed and persuasive people who don't agree with BCH often receive upvotes.

The trick is you actually have to make a good argument to get upvoted. Imagine that."
"This is/u/gypsytoy reading comprehension:

Him:  You must be a millionaire

Me:  Maybe

Him:  Aha! So, you are a millionaire. I knew it!"
"Yeah, it really sucks. I hate seeing btc go down this path. Everyone on this sub is so defensive and negative all the time- constantly accusing people of being a ""core troll! core shill!"" like everyone who disagrees with them is automatically their sworn enemy. At least people don't get banned here for not abiding by the party line. I just wish we could have a friendlier community. :("
And neither should that site be for shitting on BCH. Just sayin. 
"> Just because a comment is anti-BCH doesn't mean it's automatically downvoted. Informed and persuasive people who don't agree with BCH often receive upvotes.

I've literally never seen that happen. I've seen folks provide detailed, articulate and well-reasoned  critiques of the BCH roadmap be lashed out at and downvoted. Called a ""core shill"", ""idiot"" or some other insult and immediately and decisively downvoted by the community here. Can you provide a good counterexample? Like I said, I've *never* seen that happen."
"Wait, so you *aren't* a millionaire and that's why you're on reddit all the time fighting with people?!?

How does someone who claims to be one of the first people to come up with the idea of big blocks (placing you somewhere around '09/'10) not have a million dollars at this point?!"
I'm not going to conclusions. I'm asking. You said you were one of the first people, which puts you back to 2009. If you don't have well over a million at this point, you're just a total fuckup.
Hi asking, I'm dad!
Why should I answer a total idiot?
Yep. I'm quite impressed with his progress so far. 
Actually it's the exact opposite of censorship. Not only does the comment get to stay and people can read it, but the bot gives us some additional information about he poster so we can make an informed judgement.
You don't need to answer, the answer is abundantly clear. Can't you see that? You literally seem to be on reddit about 16 hours per day every single day. If you think it's at all believable what your claiming then you're completely delusional. Even if it were true, the bottom line is that you choose to spend all of your waking time fighting with people on reddit. What a life, eh?
Wrong™️
Sorry Dave, I can't help but to not give a fuck about your opinion of my opinion.

How many LN transactioms have you made?
Because Bitcoin Cash is the only one that's a real threat to Core.
"Its really not that hard of a concept dude, both came from the same place, both are Bitcoin (for now). If people can't grasp the concept that Apple and Linux originated from the same systems, that's their fault and not ours. I'm tired of seeing posts like these, you're basically assuming everyone is too dumb to grasp this concept that there are two chains fighting over being Bitcoin. Why don't you let people actually learn about it and make their own informed decisions?

As for the posts you're referring to, we don't know what side it is, but I can assure you that I do not care, I know which one will win from usecase, however I feel it's irrelevant and unneeded for BCH people to make the BCH is Bitcoin posts... economics will solve that eventually."
"When will theymos finally delete that thread? I don't think he likes it anymore but it's so popular he will never be able to get rid of it.

Theymos and nullc have been laying low for a while now and the new design of bitcoin.org won't have low fees in the description anymore. "
You are scammer, you said iota is shit then profited, not serious person
Well said, who cares about the Nth copy of Bitcoin.
I've been using https://www.moonstats.com/ for a while, they have the option to track your portfolio in case you store coins between different wallets or bought coins at different times :) I found them on a list of websites that support civic logins
"It’s the real Coinmarketcap......with its original coding representing the white paper.  Not the Coinmarketcap core!


#real Coinmarketcap"
I agree! That's why I was using them. I'm glad this thread is giving them some love. Perhaps they'll re-think their editorializing..? Whatever. I'm a big-tent crypto-guy, myself.
Trash and useless site, how about you give your own website a shit icon for copying coinmarketcap.
Don't generate traffic.
"Who cares? Never even heard of coincall.io but I'm sure it does absolutely nothing original and won't last long. I certainly don't care for a company that thinks this is a good business strategy, sounds like a bunch of morons who don't know how to run a service without emotion.

What really pisses me off is all these businesses thinking we give two shits about their opinion in the first place.

Because they do not leave their emotions and wildish theories away from their business and operations, they will fail, and no one will care when it falls."
"Kinda dangerous to label some stuff as a scam like that since it implies that those not labelled as such are not a scam. I doubt the list maintainer has gone through all 1500+ cryptos and carefully investigated them all to decide whether or not they might be a scam.

Edit: Their blogpost about this column can be found at https://coincall.io/shitcoins/"
"lulz, some obscure trashy piece of html labels..

my dog labeled the carpet as shithole.. I'll never buy that scammer carpet again"
"Sure he can totally continue trying to change the global recognition of BTC as bitcoin to BCH as bitcoin. It’s worked so well for him so far hasn’t it ;)"
burnnnnnn
 Call coincall a shit site!!
they're all shitcoins brah. 
The description is fairly accurate though. All else aside.
"My response:
""That's nice, dear."""
I'm amazed that this keeps getting voted up higher and higher every time I check r/btc. I've never heard of this site until now. IMO, it makes them look stupid. If it was a scam why are they listing it?
That's freaking hilarious
They're not wrong.

Isnt this the same thing roger is doing ? All day on twitter why dont you get angry then.  ? 
Redditor /u/cryptodirky has low karma in this subreddit.
"> This is very clear case of all of the BTC folk having 5 second fish memory and hardly any IQ or decency to be truthful.

5 guys with 400 accounts you mean. "
Riggged.
6, i just receive my second shirt
Oh.. a poor less useful ripoff you say?
"Semantics are important, and Ver is within his rights to try and change the association of BTC==Bitcoin. Nobody owns the name. 
"
good bot. 
They did mark tether, but not ripple.
It's somewhat biased in favor of more tech savvy people.
"Estimates tend to not be accurate 100% but they are fairly close. They do analyse backlinks, social shares. Google analytics during installation asks you to share data with external providers (if you want) - consider it the closest number you can find on the web. You can cross check with other services such as similarweb to give yourself an idea (https://www.similarweb.com/website/coinmarketcap.com#overview). If you just consider folks that refresh the page 6 times a day, won’t be hard to have numbers inflated

"
I'm sure it's up there in traffic, but maybe not in human visitors. I know a ton of apps and trackers/spreadsheets are using CMC's API's.
bad bot
"I can't speak for the ""camp"" but I sure as hell cant put stickers on my car....it's a lease God damn it....but hey one day"
This just comes across as desperate and petty to most in the space. BCH doesn’t need the bitcoin name to succeed but trying to force on ppl when it’s clear they want no part of it and acting petty and childish to anyone who opposes the sentiment will only further the distance between the masses and this community. Develop the tech, make waves on ur own merits with ur own name and that will garner more respect. But this whole debate is only important to the BCH crowd and appears petty and childish to the rest of the world, which is why many outside of this sub mock BCH and call it a shit coin. Not because it’s necessarily true but because how the community acts. 
They then spend it all on Bitcoin gold and Bitcoin diamond. 
Yes, like the coin they apparently support.
Alright, not all are like with fish memory, but all the vocal ones are. Is that better?
That's the one I use! [Proof](https://youtu.be/HlEsfaS9VJ0)
At that point, we should start calling it Bittercoin.
Sure but that’s semantics. When BTC is associated with Bitcoin, it’s not hard to see how someone could make the connection that calling BCH Bitcoin could mean that BCH is BTC especially to the layperson 
I said it was shit and went short. Profit.
thanks i needed to read smthing to sleep
"Or Tether, which if Bitcoin cash is centralised then Tether is so centralised it's a black hole. 

Or ripple.

Etc etc etc. "
Bingo! I'm happy some BCH supporters out there still think that this fuss is counterproductive
"What about unix based operating systems and forks? The libre suite? 

I agree that it is not that hard of a concept because few other software forks struggle with it, which is why I'm confused about bitcoin's difficulties with the concept. "
"Why would two competing sites send users to the other one?

The other problem with this is that it's a BTC supporting site vs A BCH supporting site. Can you even buy BCH from bitcoin.org?

So why shouldn't they be sent to bitcoin.com where they have the choice of which to buy?"
"Store over 5 years of full blocks for a whopping $155

https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01HD6ZLQ6/ref=cm_sw_r_sms_awdb_t1_xP76Ab98HBY98"
I'm happy to hear that, and also appreciate your kind words. Thanks!
My desktop pc I got 6 years ago could easily handle 32mb blocks and I've got 16tb of storage for a few hundred dollars. Curious why you think no one could run a full node? What's the limiting factor?
I just want to thank you for taking the time to respond to these inaccuracies. I’ve actually learnt a lot from this.
"except not everyone needs to run a full node, 
many users are fine with just downloading headers of blocks, like light wallets do.
jesus man, so violent and you don't even think about what you're saying. some people will run full nodes, some won't. everyone can use the network, that's the beauty of bch"
Does anyone have any information of the RAM requirements as blocks increase in size (eventually to 32 MB)?
Wow your response is so hostile. Idk what a bcasher is and you shouldn't label people for asking legitimate questions, which you didn't even answer btw. What a sad little person you must be for thinking this response will accomplish anything.
FUCK YEAH!  FUCK THOSE SMALL BLOCK COMMIE CUCKS!!!!
"Are you guys concerned about individuals who are running their own nodes?

32 MB over ten minutes. Catching up on all those blocks can take a very long time for people with bad internet.

Plus having to maintain a large enough hard drive or hard drives (in plural) after a few years I would imagine.

This would really be a big pushback for people to run their own nodes
.
 I would like to hear people's thoughts on this."
Op codes are being added, which btc dies not have.
"you bcashers brag about  how bcashes tx fees are under 1 cent and how this is important for 3rd world countries because they earn like under 1 dollar/day and  same braindead bcashers says u can run a full node for ""a few hundred dollars""? 

then with 1 gb it will be ""a few thousand dollars"" and with 1 terabyte it will be ""a few hundred thousand dollars"".

 fking you bcashers are full of shit."
Nobody will understand this unless they go back a few months.
Of course becaue they're businessman. But the future is crypto and blockchain. And such businessman maybe will go in past. I hope for that. And believe in success of such good and fast projects as Eos and Credits. The last will make 1 mln tps btw
