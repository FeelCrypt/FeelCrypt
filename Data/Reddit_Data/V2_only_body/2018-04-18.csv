"Hey /u/memorydealers

This message would of been better had you offered $100,000 USD to a children's hospital had the community of /r/bitcoin opened up their moderation logs. That's all people need to see - the moderation logs. This would go hand-in-hand with their narrative regarding the ""saving babies"" thing they use to attack you after you owned Samson Maw. You would be offering them the chance to save babies by just demanding their moderators open up the logs.

You could pay every month for 10 months - $10,000. I wouldn't trust sending $100,000 in one go cause then they'd close the logs again before too many people saw the rampant censorship going on."
There is nothing shady or illegal about it? I don't know why it should be classified as bribery instead of an honest offer? 
By this logic bribery is a noble thing to do.

"Reddit admin: ""I don't slap little girls, because I believe it's not a good thing to do.""

Roger: ""Would you do it for 100 grand?"""
Go away u/williaminlondon. Had enough of your sock puppetry, the first thing I will do as a mod is ban you.
Annnnd, that's a ban. 
How do you see segwit being reversed?  
This sub is r/btc, yet it's all about bch. How do you not see a problem with that? BTC is BTC, BCH is not BTC. 
You are misconstruing (intentionally?) Roger’s tweet. He did not say he wants to buy /r/bitcoin, he did not say who should be the mod, all he simply said is that his offer is for Reddit to do this. It’s obviously up to their discretion. All he is asking is that they provide a mod who supports free speech. 
It is not, no.
I don't like segwit but I don't think it's a showstopper. But BTC does have deeper problems than just r\/bitcoin.
Fuck me these shitty bots are getting out of hand... 
"You have been played. Just like the swarm of 50+ socks that fell for it. What a coincidence. Fancy that!
"
sure. I think most little girls would like to share that with me.. win win. 
Because I actually was already using this sub before BCH existed. In fact, the other sub made sure that this would be my main Bitcoin-related forum when the other suck excuse me sub banned me.
Don't be too critical in the other sub though, you wouldn't want to be forced to use this sub, would you? Good luck.
Didn't you hear /u/btcnewsupdates? *No one believes it, therefore it's not true*. Only a fool would not understand that rock-solid, impeccable logic. 
"You do? How is that different than censorship?

This is basically ""hunting for dissenters"", which is one of the tools employed by totalitarian regimes."
"Someone flagged in this sub, calling me a ""troll""... that's fun for sure.

(And who the f* is ""giusus"" now?)"
No one was talking about r/bitcoin at all, we were talking about r/cryptocurrency 
"Not a problem if it's downvoted, it's a problem when it's censored.

Mods in r/cryptocurrency are doing Ok I guess"
Not everything, it depends. Sometimes it is upvoted and sometimes it is downvoted. Some of the users there are supportive of BCH.
Doesn't sound exactly as a free speech problem. 
Yep, it's my first language. I am just pointing out the irony. Thanks for your insight.
"Enabling free speech can never be seen as bad behavior in my eyes. Money is an incentive for plenty of things, just because money is exchanging hands doesn't make it bad. Though it sets a bad precedent that reddit would have to be paid for adding something good...

> This goes beyond the Bitcoin, Reddit and the kids playing a game bigger than them without understanding the basic rules of the civics. It's pathetic.

Lol k. Big words there."
"Don't worry, I unsubscribed so these shitty threads won't show up on my front page anymore.

Free as in freedom and free as in beer are different things, English is one of the few languages which has the same word for these two. 
pretty sure r/bitcoin is against reddits tos
Yes.
The proof if literally in the tweet. If Roger is offering 100k for r/bitcoin what makes you think he didn't do the same for @Bitcoin on twitter? Only an idiot wouldn't accept this as a possibility.
How about he's willing to give up his own money to make the community a better place, everyone knows r/bitcoin is pretty much the worst place to discuss crypto 
"> ""I'll pay you $100,000 USD if you simply appoint a moderator to /r/Bitcoin who supports free speech.""

It's because that's what he does. It's not odd, he's just doing what he does.
Well it is true, bye censoring out any opposing idea or criticisms they are doing immense harm to BTC.
If it must be reversed it would just be another soft fork. 
Go to r/bitcoin. There is a sub for the btc token already.

It's funny the Coreans want BTC to change to become more like BCH and BCH supporters want BTC stay the way it is. It really shows you that absolutely nobody thinks that BTC's current roadmap is sensible.
Or, you know, the reddit admins *don't think /r/bitcoin has broken any rules*. Just a thought.

Because if you are only looking at it like an investment, hedging would be smart.
r/btc - where you get upvoted for literally repeating yourself word for word, as long as it’s anti-bitcoin. May not be censored, but it is certainly an echo chamber. And the 10 minute delay for dissenting voices ensures one side of the discussion dominates.
"Totally.  It's censorship by a different name, so that the egotistical authoritarian mods of this sub (Ver) can cry that the other sub is heavily censored while also not being hypocritical.

Instead, this sub is just pure one-sided irrational propaganda that is desperately trying to push the lie that bitcoin is bad and bitcoin cash is good.

"
"Flagged?
Bet it's your other account"
"Getting downvoted on r/cryptocurrency is not censorship.

Although that's inherent from the lack of free speech at r/bitcoin.

because it's a stupid offer and if this is someone the community looks up to here, I'm so glad I'm not apart of this community.

Silly, we discuss Bitcoin here, the real Bitcoin (BCH)
"The existence of the censorship itself, it's because of personal interests: you enforce the censorship to have a profit; trying to combat it with more corruption, because paying someone to obtain a result you wouldn't obtain otherwise is that, falls under the same criteria that have created the issue, in fact you're legitimating a bad behavior.

Moderator? Sure it should be owner?
It would have to be a top mod to be able to make any difference, otherwise theymos and his goons would just override their decisions. 
Roger, you're a beacon in the storm. Keep on keeping on, sir. 
"He knows they won't do it anyways...

But it would be nice to get some ban/delete stats from a moderator that cares."
Sounds serious to me.
Good point.  Open discussion might force changes and I don't want to see bitcoin core get fixed at this point.  
"Indeed, any attempt at ""free speech"" in that sub would be a caricature of it, and would only prolong the pain that would still inevitably lead to it's permanent amputation from the community. It's time to let it die already u/memorydealers."
"I hope this guy is kidding... he must be ... or I am the only one who see the giant no sense of proposing to buy the free speech with money, that is the exact reason of why the censorship exists!

Someone wake me up..."
I think if we could remove Ver and Charlie, both Cash and LTC would improve in the long term. They are huge barriers to entry. 
"this psychotic guy lost his connection with reality totally.

im sure this will not be the last episode of ""roger went bananas"""
Yeah, this could have been nice before the fork, because then the BCH fork might not have been necessary, but it's too late now. Now I don't want the situation over there to change. Let them just keep digging.
It's not about changing the mod, its about bringing attention to the lack of free speech there. 
I don’t like the censorship on r/Bitcoin either. But hostile remarks like this don’t help either. When are we  going to realize that crypto is not a zero sum game? Just stick up for your own ideals and let others do their own thing.
I can’t even voice my opinion without getting downvotes it’s rediculious now my account I can only send one message every eight minutes it’s bad 
bribing reddit is free speech?
"Serious question:  How can anyone continue to take bcash seriously when it still has the ASIC-boost bug and no intention to fix it?

What gives a crypto coin value is its community.  How can bcash be taken seriously when the community leaders are all con-artists like Craig Wright, Roger Ver, Jihan, and that other dude?"
Bribing them to hire anyone of their choosing to implement free speech? I think the whole point is that is an eminently reasonable thing to request, not self-serving as free speech means free to call Roger anything users want and promote or cast aspersions on anything they want.
more like supports hate speech. 
Bad move imo. Let r/bitcoin as it is, no hope in 1 mod changing anything, and what for? 
Let's bribe instead? That will create a neautral forum!
"What a retarded offer.

They are not willing to change moderators for free because of their ideals and you think they would do it for a bribe?!

Free speech? Moderator? Why scam artist wanna pay for moderation? I thought he is after free speech. And moderator would moderate = kill free speech.  Hmm Roger. You loosing it I think..
Why is this sub supporting this? I mean, open air offer to pay to install someone Roger likes? Seems like a bribe to me. 
"I'm here for bitcoin, I disagree with turning this into a bitcoin cash sub, as this is r/btc, and should remain bitcoin orientated, with discussion of forks and technical debates allowed.

I will provide a **counter balance to your biased moderator team as they are on you payroll, and ultimately answer to you**."
Unclear to me why so much drama with R/Bitcoin if in the end, all those that are unhappy with that like Roger, do not want to talk about Bitcoin but about bitcoin cash?. I was hoping that the fork would do its job by splitting all that drama away and I wish those supporting BCH can have it's own r/BCH place and then for bitcoiners there will always be r/Bitcoin and then r/BTC and people will always be free to choose. 
He was trying to bend reddit over by appealing to their dismal financial situation.  Manipulative as per his status quo.

"If i have to listen to b-cash boy roger continue to manipulate BTC i'm gunna start a ICO called BCASH the real bitcoin
"
Roger you're my hero!
Roger realizes there's a price to be paid for freedom /s
He should buy BCH with that $100k instead, then when BCH is worth $20k he can buy Reddit.
I was thinking the same thing.  Odd move indeed.
We shouldn't have to pay Reddit to do this. The tweet from Roger is just silly posturing. Nothing will come of it, and it reflects pretty poorly on Roger IMHO.
"Doesn't help that he's known in crypto for shouting ""I've never paid for a sockpuppet in my life.""

Also Ver: ""I'll pay you to appoint someone that will let me spam /r/bitcoin."""
Roger always puts his money where his mouth is.
"He obviously knows how reddit works. 

Saying $100,000 gets peoples attention. 

I think r/cryptocurrency needs free speech too. That’s where I originally went for what I thought was unbiased crypto discussion.  

Edit: okay, maybe ‘free speech’ is the wrong way to phrase it. Just heavily biased. 

Edit2: I know people can have different opinions - what I’m trying to say, IMO, is that /cc is biased in an unnatural way because of misinformation, likely originating from censorship on /bitcoin"
This is the worst thing Ver has ever twitted. Wouldn't the best thing be donating a fraction of that money to make a new forum with subs dedicated for BCH and for BTC without the ability to censor, only to archive? It reeks of influencing
"Also means ""I'll pay you to moderate my enemy's internet forums with a goal that I have designated."""
Basically he wants to pay for a moderator that does what he wants. 
Mans a legend but maybe he has had better ideas in the past
"Hey, /u/memorydealers, reddit doesn't appoint mods to most subreddits. As for free-speech supporting mods over there, I'd say /u/ThePiachu fits the bill. He's posted about discussion suppression numerous times on his blog ([https://tpbit.blogspot.ca/) ](https://tpbit.blogspot.ca/)and does year-in-review posts that seem very balanced. But, one mod can't do much when outnumbered.

And, hey, if you wanna throw $100,000 my way I definitely won't refuse :-P"
Pretty pathetic. Puts the whole space under a bad light when this type of stuff goes on. 
"I""m sure he's being just polite to Reddit owner, he can buy it right now if he wants lol!"
Make sure it's the top moderator.
Support free speech by paying $100,000 to a company that actively restrains free speech, even the CEO directly. Very smart!
"Oh, another ... ""Contrarian"" (cough cough) sock!"
Bad move imo. Roger is just reinforcing the narrative r/bitcoin has about him bribing everyone under the sun.
That's the exact reason why the censorship exists? Buying free speech with money? The censorship exists because of a takeover of bitcoin: https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7mg4tm/updated_dec_2017_a_collection_of_evidence/
"You know ASICBoost also exists on Bitcoin and is actively being used by mining pools right now. SegWit did not ""fix"" ASICBoost."
I keep asking the same question too. I think it's one of those 'vocal minority' situations where there a small bunch but they sound like a lot
"> it's fraudulent to have the name R/BTC when all this sub does it shit on BTC.

...no, that's not fraud, even if you ignore the historical reasons for this naming."

"Let rbitcoin moderator situation as it is.

They are doing a great job at killing BTC.."
This seems pretty silly, no? One good moderator can't make up for the censorship of all of the others. 
"Oh look! Another sock!

Moving on..."
Do you get the irony of posting this here?
Redditor /u/YWorkFT has low karma in this subreddit.
Where do i sign up? lmfao
As someone who sees both sides Ver puts on confrences that are not supposed to be BCH confrences and pushes his coin so he's a hypocrite. I will say r/BTC is more free speech than r/Bitcoin as I've talked shit on here or been a dissenting view andI'm still allowed to post so props to this subreddit for that but Very is also a hypocrite. 
/u/memorydealers \^ this!
r/noncensored_bitcoin you can see how much they censor here
"Why in the world would we give Reddit any money?

How about a decentralized reddit?  I am really hoping EOS gives us some decentralized applications like this that would be able to scale to the size of reddit's user base."
"It just reinforces the maturity and sophistication of the BCH fanboys in the /r/btc sub.

It's like all the 4chan btards grew up and came here. "
I'm celebrating. Roger Ver just embarrassed himself and damaged the reputation of Shitmain Cash and this sub.

"Paying people off

Classic Rodge"
">Hey, u/memorydealers, reddit doesn't appoint mods to most subreddits.

Yes, r/Bitcoin is self started and self regulated. Is reddit meddling in that sub\-reddit not the same as a government trying to limit the free will of the people? And is paying for that privilege not kinda like a tax. Both things Roger is against ;\) "
Except it's against Reddit's TOS and it's not free if he's offering $100k.
Remember when he said insider trading isn't really a crime? You want that guy representing your sub?
Roger you need to target r/cryptocurrency instead. 
">I think r/cryptocurrency needs free speech too.

Since when they didn't ? I can see that they are biased but I can also see that it's because most of them are in cryptocurrency to earn $ and there are people with bots that brigade certain posts."

"r/cc has as much free speech as this sub does. Every time I post about BCH I just get downvoted into oblivion. Same way if you’re pro-BTC here you just get downvoted super hard.

They don’t ban you for having the “wrong” opinion"
Yeah, this is unfortunate. Reddit should change the lead mod of that sub, but they should do it because of violations of modiquette rather than for Roger's money.
In all honesty his 'offer' is pure amateur hour as it shows a completely lack of business saavy/sophistication and oozes of ego.  AKA Trump.
I guess it is time to start an ICO to rename r/btc to r/bcash. 
You can't change the way people think - the fact they don't ban people for thinking differently than you is exactly what free speech is. Get your ducks in a row. 
That narrative is easily debunked, no one believes it.

haha shutup noob 
I have put in a lot of time and effort. I have developed a full client implementation. I am currently developing an Android wallet app. I know how it works. You on the other hand have provided no evidence of understanding and refuse to answer the simplest of questions. 
Post a thread asking why the block size hasn't been increased yet. Go ahead I'll wait. Then we'll see if you get banned.
"How does bitcoin consensus work?
>refuse to answer the simplest of questions."
I could answer it in a few sentences. I am not looking for a complex answer. Start with who defines Bitcoin consensus? I said it was Bitcoin developers. You disagreed, but gave no explanation.
"You missed the point 

>  r/bitcoin loves to hate on ""bcash"" and try to meme their way to victory in general,

which I equate to

>  r/btc loves to hate on ""bitcoin core"" and try to shitpost childish memes about btc holders being suckers in general,"
Ugh, more memes from Roger... When will it end? Set an example, be the bigger person, post about tech developments, stuff that actually matters!! 
quite sorry for them :(
Holy shit I know this is something I see a lot but the upvote ratio on those threads below are insane, pretty textbook brigading going on.
"Why buy a 15 passenger van, when a bike will do?

Maybe in the future we will buy the van when we need it.

BTC should do 9MB blocks as an epic troll."
"It is called that because /r/bitcoin banned everyone who would talk about bitcoins scalability problem. This started many years ago before BCH. These people migrated to this subreddit. It just so happens BCH falls in line with what most people here think is the real bitcoin.

Pretty crazy how few people know this."
"Don't click any image called ""Minor"" anything... It's a honeypot boys"
"Check out the documentary Push. The director set out to answer the question, can you get someone off the street responding to an add to willingly commit murder. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4h0zmYAfWEo

the result is shocking. "
"Maybe many of us, many of whom have in fact been around for a while, simply disagree with the notion of raising the blocksize as a longterm scaling solution and find Roger’s aggressive, arrogant, and often propagandist messaging (ie a headline that proclaims BCH has taken over Japan accompanied by a photo of two guys posing for a photo with swag) distasteful. Also the brand confusion is frustrating.

Many BCH supporters on this sub ask those who support BTC to reflect and look at themselves in the mirror, which is great and fair, but I wonder if those making such statements hold themselves to the same standards."
The good news is, you have less than a month to wait.
I don't get the analogy, wouldn't the BCH guy's solution be a bigger cart?
Still confusing nonetheless 
Most people do know, it's no secret, the irony is just too tempting
Except that any honest assessment sees it chronic on r/bitcoin and more rare on r/btc.
"> Maybe many of us, many of whom have in fact been around for a while, simply disagree with the notion of raising the blocksize as a longterm scaling solution

I'd be interested to know whether you're all still using 2400 kbps modems.  And leading the campaign against high def videos on Youtube.  And arguing against widening roads at city council.  It's fascinating to watch such engineering proficiency in action.  When the 14.4 bps modem came out, you guys were all over that propaganda sub.  Remember the one guy arguing for the 28.8 US Robotics - he was way too aggressive and arrogant.  And the brand confusion was frustrating.  What we need are very narrow roads - that's how we scale.  Everyone can just pay a $3 fee to hop on Elizabeth Stark's back.  /s

Redditor /u/memo_cash account age is 0 days.
The length of time that a reddit account has been open is not a reflection of how long the owner of the account has been holding cryptocurrency. Additionally, I'm not sure what, if anything, this has to do with my previous comment.
"It is indeed. It is really too bad /r/bitcoin was censored so badly. 

At least here you can discuss BTC fairly without the worry of a ban. "
Your reddit username is hodler, but your account is less than six months old. Now **that's** confusing!
"/u/trolldetectr is a shitty bot because I am not a troll. if this is a way to tag people in a supposedly ""open minded"" sub just because of divergent opinions causing a bit of lower karma, I guess this is not an open minded sub."
"> They do that yeah. and /r/btc does the same thing, even more heavily.

No, they don't. Look at the recent post about which sub uses the ""hodl"" meme  the most. r/btc is at the absolute bottom. These numbers prove you wrong.

"> We have very different perceptions then. r/bitcoin loves to hate on ""bcash"" and try to meme their way to victory in general, 

They do that yeah. and /r/btc does the same thing, even more heavily. Check the /u/btcnewsupdates guy for example

For the rest, well meh. The philosophy behind it (adoption over holding shit and prices) is better but the execution is just as childish and bad.

tbf /r/buttcoin feels like the only sane subreddit nowadays"
Right? They gotta post it, and I gotta counter them for all the newbies that may be strolling by that don't know the history
I agree that I don’t like how much of a public face he can be for BCH, but there is  nothing scammy about the website he runs. I don’t think anything about what you said excuses the actions of trolls who smear his name under false pretenses.
The guy posts multiple threads on this subreddit daily promoting his scam site and other interests so maybe it’s not that people are hounding his every move but rather that he spams this forum daily and thus there’s a high level of negative responses to his propaganda. 
What on earth are you talking about?  What could you possibly have against Ver?
"We have very different perceptions then. r/bitcoin loves to hate on ""bcash"" and try to meme their way to victory in general, whereas here we're much more focused on solutions, technical solutions, and adoption in general. You'll often see people here push back against anti-btc trolling, you practically never see that on r/bitcoin."
That is only for transaction validation.
