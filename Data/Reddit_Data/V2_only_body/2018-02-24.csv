At first I thought you was being serious🤣
"Common misconception. If you want proof, look at gold over the long run. 100 years ago, 1oz would buy you a good hand-tailored suit. Same with 50 years ago. Same with today. And the same will likely be true 100 years from now. It’s not that prices have gone up, it’s that the dollar has gone down. And to be clear, that’s not a bug of the fiat monetary system... it’s a feature. It allows the government to “tax” 2-3% of your money every single year without you noticing or maybe even understanding what’s going on.

“Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon” - Milton Friedman

All else being equal, to the extent that crypto currencies are not inflationary (i.e. they don’t expand the supply), they will hold their value. And with economic growth, their value will increase over time.

Bitcoin is an easily transferable decentralized global store of value. If you’re unable to see a use case for that, try moving to Venezuela.
"To me this is proof of nothing except that it is foolish to hold gold as an investment and smart if you want to make sure you can buy tomorrow what you can already afford today.

Yes, that's the problem: since tx inputs still refer to original, malleable, txid, then that's not really a fix.
"Nice try buddy. Try again. 

> you don't have an argument 

Conveniently ignores the first link. 

> You literally linked to a person that corrected my math. 

He's clearly talking about dust consolidation but of course, you twisted it again so it can support your narrative. He clearly said that output reduction is not the goal because that's not what's happening, inputs reduction is the goal. At least for the Bitcoin BTC fork. Bitcoin Cash is not affected. 

Which proves that you were wrong. Batching doesn't reduce outputs. It just reduces fees but hey, you're free to believe what you want. You know you're wrong but just want to keep trying. Go ahead keep trying. It amuses me. "

Sort by volume. You are either lying or ignorant. Neither is acceptable if you're going to be spreading false ideas."
Or the entire month of September, when it cleared dozens of times? July and August?
"> Output counting is a good way to gauge usage since a lot of the recent transactions are just merging together millions and millions of small, old UTXOs

Batching lowers outputs significantly.... the idea that outputs being down means usage is down is a misunderstanding of how Bitcoin works..."
More likely it's due to the increased number of exchanges implementing batching...
"> And don't forget also to look at # of transactions being processed. It's way down

Except a ton of companies have announced batching of transactions in the last few months... which easily explains the drop in transaction count.

> if you look at number of outputs, they are still way down

If you don't understand that batching also lowers outputs, you don't understand the Bitcoin protocol."
"That's explained by the large number of companies that implemented batching in the last few months... This is basic stuff.

Daily volume is a far better metric as it isn't affected by batching, and volume is at December 2017 levels, which is pretty normal considering the December-to-February media rush on all of crypto just settled down."
"Batching transactions has been done for awhile... that does not explain the drop in transactions. 

Daily volume is trading related. Is heavily influenced by pumping from other cryptos. "
"> Less people are using BTC than before, which means adoption has halted. 

It has more volume than any other coin... "
Batching lowers outputs significantly.... the idea that outputs being down means usage is down is a misunderstanding of how Bitcoin works...
"> He clearly said that output reduction is not the goal because that's not what's happening, inputs reduction is the goal.

What he actually said is that input reduction is more important for lowering the size of transactions being added to the mempool. You misunderstood him.

> Batching doesn't reduce outputs

I literally just explained how it does. Explain how what I explained is incorrect, if you can. Otherwise, admit the truth that you were wrong."
LOL! Not even close!
Batching lowers transactions. Volume is the best metric we have to judge actual use, and it's at December 2017 levels...
"> Plenty of comments here explaining why this drop in usage is due to a loss in adoption due to high fees

That's entirely hearsay, not based on any real evidence... volume is still the highest of all coins."
"No, you really don't. Allow me to explain, and you can apologize once you realize your mistake.

Take a look at any block of transactions. [Here is a good example... expand the list at the bottom until you can see about 100 or so](https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/block/510743)

You might see a couple of transactions [like this one](https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/transaction/db33de197c7900b8b0787add2a0d8fef4a0e3d716ddf761a3ddb0dfb26dc056e) which only have 1 output. That means someone sent 100% (minus the miner fee) of the value of the inputs to a single output. *This is how you appear to think most transactions are: A single output... which means if you batch 100 them, you get the same number of outputs, 100.*

[Now go back to the list of transaction in the block, and look at the average output of transactions. Is it 1?](https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/block/510743) **No, the average is actually over 2.** The main reason transactions have multiple outputs is due to how fees work.

If you have two inputs of 1,000,000 satoshis each, totaling 2,000,000 satoshis, and you want to send your friend 1,500,000 satoshis, what happens if you use a single output to your friend's address? *The remaining 500,000 satoshis go to the mining fee.* So what do you do to avoid that and pay a more reasonable amount in miner fees? You have a second output that returns the difference (the total input minus the receiver value minus the miner fee) back to your **change address**.

So now that you understand that, what do you think happens when you have 1,000,000 transactions, each with a change address output in addition to the receiver output? Consolidate that down to (for this theoretical situation) 1,000 transations with 1,000 receiver outputs each. How many change outputs does each transaction need? **The answer is ONE.**

Boom. You batched 1,000,000 transactions into 1,000 and outputs went from 2,000,000 to 1,001,000."
Batching easily explains the lowered outputs. You just don't understand how the protocol works...
"> Batching transactions has been done for awhile

By some entities, but not by the large number of companies that implemented batching in the last few months... It easily explains the drop in transactions. If you don't understand that, you're just being purposely ignorant to how Bitcoin works."
"Poor kid, you're so blinded by the propaganda that it's just sad. You're now arguing for the sake of arguing. I will help you out and stop responding to you because you're only embarrassing yourself. You just explained what I just did (which of course I didn't explain in detail) but with a wall of text and of course, twisted it to conveniently try to ""be right"" trying to explain dust consolidation as batching which just shows how little you actually understand the Bitcoin protocol. 

Since you only believe what you read in r/Bitcoin, here's a [link](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7uss3k/psa_bitcoin_transactions_are_not_down_as_batching/
) from there that says/explains what I just explained.

[But I'm pretty sure you already know this because yesterday you ""tried"" to change what batching actually is with your post there but they just shut you down because you were wrong.] (https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7zjsfl/the_narrative_that_batching_isnt_responsible_for/duop60h?) 

Have a nice day buddy. :) "
"> Cause no ones buying it 😂

It literally has more volume, by far, than any other coin."
"You should put some effort into correcting the people who are confused on the matter, to offset the fact that you added to the confusion by spreading the idea that outputs were a good metric.

This false narrative needs to be nipped in the bud :)"
"Serious question: Do you honestly not understand that batching lowers outputs significantly?

Not trying to patronize... I just want to know if you're being an ass, or genuinely don't understand that part of the Bitcoin protocol."
Transaction counts go down with batching, and since a large number of companies have implemented batching in the last few months, it easily explains the drop in transactions. Volume is a better metric, and it puts Bitcoin at December 2017 levels, which is pretty normal given the December-to-February media rush that temporarily raised all of crypto...
"This is most likely due to automated systems that just don't update correctly, or people having set a fee for their systems and then never checking it again.

Transactions are clearing at 1 to 2 sats/byte now..."
Usage is around December 2017 levels, which is pretty normal given that there was a December-to-February media rush on all of crypto...
"No, that was just my latest examples. 

Have a nice day nocoiner :-D"
3 months... the mempool was clear in October dude...
Longest chain in this context means the chain with the most work.  This is how the fork is resolved when multiple blocks are found simultaneously.  What you are thinking of is block height.  A block height of a billions means little when the difficulty is low, so blockheight tells you nothing.
Demand is at December 2017 levels, which is pretty normal given the big December-to-February media rush, and volume is still higher than literally any other coin...
Literally the highest volume of any coin...
"> What was the new implementation that made BTC mempool faster?

It's batching. Exchanges started batching transactions which lowers transaction count massively and adds far less to the mempool."
Source for number of companies batching transactions in the past few months? 
You literally linked to a person that corrected my math, and I commented to you with the updated math which still shows an output drop of nearly 50%. You're getting defensive and insulting me because you don't have an argument. You know you're wrong. My work is done.
"Batching lowers outputs significantly.... the idea that outputs being down means usage is down is a misunderstanding of how Bitcoin works...

>  (Ex., If you pack payments to ten people into one transaction instead of ten transactions, you'll still have ten outputs to the wallets of the ten people.

**Correct example:** You go from ten transactions which each have a receiver and a change address output, and you end up with ten receiver outputs and **one** change output. You just dropped outputs by 45%."
"> the capacity of the network is basically the same as ever, so this just comes from less use it seems

Except a ton of companies have announced batching of transactions in the last few months... which easily explains the drop in transaction count."
"Yeah I realized after my post that it does alter outputs. An output batched transaction for N recipients causes N+1 outputs (one change), whereas done separately it causes 2N outputs.

Thus, universal adoption of heavy output batching leads to a halving in outputs."
"Nice try buddy, but no. Outputs has been going down a lot after that huge BTC backlog. [If the fees were going down ""because of batching"" then outputs would be going up. Click here and tap ""Outputs"".](https://outputs.today) 

So yeah, BTC fees are going down because less people are using BTC. "
"I do but apparently you don't. Batching DOESN'T lower outputs. Batching lowers UTXOs and transactions per day which makes the Bitcoin protocol more efficient with the block space (but reduces privacy). Instead of making 50 transactions to pay to 50 people (costly and inefficient) you only have to make 1 transaction with 50 outputs. Outputs are the same but reduces transactions fees. If outputs are going down, that means that less people are making transactions. So yeah, I know what I'm talking about. 

I'm not being an ass, I'm just not blinded by Blockstream propaganda. Do your research before claiming you know about something instead of blindly reposting what others say. "
"I could point to [ZebPay](http://bitcoinist.com/how-zebpay-managed-to-lower-bitcoin-transaction-fees/), [Quedex](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2717636.0), [BitPanda](https://blog.bitpanda.com/full-segwit-transaction-batching-on-bitpanda-5c8c7daa21ca?gi=16559ea2bd71), [Shapeshift](https://info.shapeshift.io/blog/2018/02/22/shapeshift-now-batching-bitcoin-transactions), or a number of others... but it makes more sense to look to batched transaction count. Fortunately, Blockchain allows us to look that up by month. Check out the last four months:

It literally has more volume than any other coin...
Batching easily explains the drop in transaction count, and daily volume is at December 2017 levels, which is pretty normal given the December-to-February media rush that temporarily raised all of crypto...
He said needing to be online would be a big problem for merchants. Isn't that how all credit/debit cards work?
