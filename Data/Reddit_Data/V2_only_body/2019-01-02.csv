Any decentralized blockchain overtaking XRP is good news.  Vitalik has kinda won me over recently, I can see now that he's more for decentralization than anything, and I think that's a good thing for the world even if he does have a kind of cult following.  I'm not convinced in staking, but if he is, good luck to him.
Amazing. Congrats on your outstanding username!
Vitalik also says he doesn't want Ethereum to be about him, and to his credit he warned last year during the huge bullrun that ETH might tank. 
"Xrp the standard m8 

(Oddly enough when I wrote “xrp” it autocorrected to “Corp”)"
You can't trust a trustless system it's in the name duh, it's *trust less*.
Well, since it is a speculative pump, I would expect a sell-off later. 
"Though, apparently Ethereum Classic Vision is coming up soon lol

No Im not kidding https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5089443.220"
But no one uses xrp
Even after my wire transfer settled, I had to wait two weeks before I could transfer anything.
I don’t see that
Ok thanks. I’ve read s bit about the ledger thing. It kind of works like an external hard drive in a way. 
He doesn’t usually comment on price action, which is imho for the better.
Meh, PoS is obviously bad but I am open to other algorithms existing
Nano is crypto and quite interesting
"Lol. So Nano, which is an excellent and probably one of the best techs out there shouldn't be in the list.

Does anybody actually use them? Last I checked, there were less than a few thousand daily active users across all Ethereum dapps combined. There were literally more employees at Consensys (pre-layoffs) than actual dapp users.
since when the hell is tron mineable?
"I know of a company had an idea and was going to run it on Eth. 

But the crazy swings of the price of it compared to fiat made it impossible.  We couldn’t make the numbers add up with so much unpredictability."

I use DAI almost daily for trading and cheap lending. Arguably, the entire crypto space is still speculative.

Maybe just include top-25 tokens by mcap in the calculation. That will get rid of a lot of low mcap scam coins although it will still include some irrationally valued tokens unfortunately. 
The amount of nano a regular person would have isn’t that much and their vote is irrelevant. It goes against the best interests of large holders to vote for malicious nodes. Any conspiracy to take over the network would require a huge amount of capital and a lot of time. However it’s true that they could double spend and sell before the market can react, maybe funds voting for a representative should be locked for a certain amount of time. Theirs no incentive for running a Bitcoin/Tor/Monero node, yet many people do it. 
Well, you can't deny that many people would blindly follow Vitalik's opinion if there'd be another Ethereum fork.
">I see no correlation with cults there.

You must not remember the 2017 spike then, people were hailing Vitalik as an all-knowing genius, and the price of ether fluctuated by several hundred dollars simply based on rumors of his death and abandoning eth.

Just because it's not harmful, doesn't mean that crypto cults are a good thing.  Look at Charlie Lee, he potentially tanked the entire market with his dump announcement, and has likely damaged the community irreparably with his juvenile tweets and market manipulation.  The only reason that Vitalik is arguably benevolent is the fact that he advocates for decentralization, which means his importance will be diminished over time as well."

After constantinople I reckon 
Miner rewards are being reduced from 3 to 2 ETH per block. Why would that indicate a sell off?
It absolutely should not be included because no one knows what the price would be if they were to be put back into circulation. The price of xrp shot up drastically when they locked it up. It changes the view of speculators drastically. You cannot simply include those tokens because the market *will* price xrp differently if they were to be released into circulation.
It’s a non-contentious hard-fork so there will still be only 1 chain and thus no profit to be made from selling the other.
That’s a pilot program. I’m talking substantive, continued use of Ethereum.
How much do you get per Nano shill?
All dPoS coins are all shit for these reasons. 
"Every Nano holder can add voting power to a representative proportional to the amount of Nano they have. Representatives with high voting power effectively become validators.

There are significant problems with this system:

1. Most people will never change their representative. They will just use whatever is the default on their wallet. Requiring average people to monitor the network and adjust their representative based on its current state is ridiculous.
2. Large holders can conspire and capture the system by choosing malicious representatives. In comparison a large holder in a PoW network has no power to maliciously attack the system.
3. Running a validator requires $ for hardware/bandwidth/electricity etc (it is a tiny fraction of the cost of mining, but it is still there and will grow if Nano grows). Nano doesn't have any mechanism to pay validators for their work. This is an unsustainable system. If they do eventually add a fee mechanism for validators it will have the same problem as DASH: rent-seeking behavior by large holders. The more coins you have the more validating power you have. Your share of fees is totally based on the stake directed at you. There is no competition between entities for those fees like there is in PoW coins. In such a system it is optimal to sit on your hoard and rake in fees. In contrast, the competitive capitalist nature of mining means that the validators (the miners who actually find the blocks) are constantly in flux. In addition, miners are forced to invest extensively in hardware that is only really useful for mining, meaning they have an incentive to not maliciously attack the currency that makes their investment useful. PoS validators have no such investment and suffer no consequences for destroying the currency, they could perform massive double spends/roll backs/chain splits and sell all their coins at any moment."
Are the validates voted for tho with nano? Don’t you assign a representative?
"Nano relies on centralized validators. 

Monero is very cool but has problems scaling. I think there will be an enduring market for privacy coins, but people like Ver are concentrated on making a global currency."
"> 150 mil is a lot

Sure, to normal people, and to Crypto. 

It's 0.01% of their total assets. It's a *rounding error* for them. They could lose it all and it wouldn't affect their bottom line *at all*

The top 10 in the Fortune 500 did $2.296T in revenue last year. The market cap of the top 10 cryptos right now is $113.6B. Fortune #10 did more in revenue then that.

So hype it up as much as you want, $150M in normal financial markets is fucking nothing. "
Seeing you have the same amount of downvotes I do, I'd say you're wrong :) 
"> Nano has centralized validators

Perhaps you are confusing it with Iota? AFAIK, there are no centralized validators in the Nano ecosystem. Please prove me wrong."
I agree with you on the Monero part. I don’t fully understand how Nano works. I thought each transaction was its own block and the nodes stored the current balances.
"That’s such a stupid comparison.

No matter how much money you have, 150 mil is a lot, you can try and down play it all you like."
The bet is a future decentalized app will not have a centralized counterpart.
I’m not 100% in that camp but either way the current dApps are so primitive I highly doubt they’ll be the YouTubes and PayPal’s of decentralized apps. 
"I never said Nano is insecure, I said it must be insecure or centralized. Nano has centralized validators. 

You're in the wrong forum trying to shill your PoS scheme. This forum is dedicated to Nakamoto Consensus. "
"After reading their whitepaper, I believe the only reason it's fast is that they essentially got rid of the entire blockchain thingy (what they're calling ""blockchain"" is not that). If the only thing you have is what amounts to zero-conf, then yep, fast it is, but also unstable and insecure as hell - so you need at least some way to patch around this double spend problem that blockchain used to solve. So they have this voting for validators thing, which may solve some of the double spends - maybe. Or, maybe not."
I just don’t like their narrative. “Good tech” but its just a bunch of centralized chains pretending to act as 1. I prefer Bitcoin Cash over Nano for sure but I really don’t understand why someone like Ver doesn’t support XMR. Monero>Bitcoin Cash. 
Yeah I dont think it's mineable either. Weird
It’s not value, it’s the fact that your own article admits this is a pilot. You have no clue whether the experience met their standards, or if they will continue to use Ethereum. It’s not a real program.
I think there’s very clear reasons why decentralized apps will never be as good as their centralized counterparts.
I didn't mean to imply that this thing is in some way legit, probably just another ETC in the making, but if it gives me more trash to sell for ETH or BCH I won't say no.

I'm guessing if $150 million worth of assets by a institution won't move you, then nothing will. FWIW, there's plenty of other completed use-cases out there, revealed by only some light searches.

Well tbf that's a win win for him. Say it's gonna tank, doesn't, oh well. Say it's gonna tank, does, I warned you.
Read through the whitepaper where they promise PoS with Sharding. Yeah right, I’m sure their small team can implement it safer and quicker than hunderds of Ethereum developers lol.
They use XRP to suck the money out of retail investors and crypto market using their tokens printed out of thin air. That's how it's being used.
Make sure you completed KYC verification.  Know your customer.
All PoS coins are either insecure or centralized. For a PoS system to have the same level of security as Nakamoto Consensus it would require holders of >50% of all coins to validate every transaction (something which does not scale for obvious reasons).

Not enough vitriol and name-calling and shitcoin-per-paragraph in your comment for this to be related to cryptocurrency. Get your positivity outta here!
About time.
What does it tell you that 2 of the top 4 market cap coins are scam coins? 
That's because it's not even in crypto.
"Marketcap is a meaningless metric and XRP is irrelevant/not trying to do the same things as BCH and ETH are anyway.

"
It's about time, don't know how this shit coin is in top 5.  Maybe because it's cheap people think they can get that 1000x but that would make the market cap 15 trillion which is unlikely?
The fact that XRP is even listed as a cryptocurrency is pretty odd.
Do these market cap figures for XRP consider or discount the amount of XRP withheld by the founders? 
Okay, and? What does this have to do with Bitcoin?
I for one am going to party hard when Bitcoin BCH overtakes XRP. 
Xrp can suck it on the real
I can't really congratulate them as XRP is not a cryptocurrency and shouldn't be included anyway. Apples to oranges. Good luck to them anyway though.

The idea that a small handful of people will have unchecked control over the money supply of a nation and will use that power for the betterment of the citizens and the economy, and will not abuse the power to extract unfair economic benefit for themselves at the expense of everyone else, is retarded to a degree that is almost impossible to comprehend.

I know the whole coin market is suffering now, but is this development more about the declining strength of XRP or the increasing strength of ETH?
I'm expecting we do the same eventually, should regain at least those 500 usd price.
Ripple shouldnt even be on CMC.
Their latest narrative is that XRP is still 2nd because the escrow supply should be calculated into it. Maybe I'm wrong, but I'd say if that was displayed it would cause a huge dump to get that mc back to normal (still way too high) levels.
There is order in the galaxy again :-)

You pretty much just negated your previous two sentences and agreed with me. 

> Theirs no incentive for running a Bitcoin/Tor/Monero node, yet many people do it. 

Running a full node right now takes relatively little investment and many people do it as a hobby. That will not be the case as bitcoin scales up. That is fine though because only miners need to run a full node, regular users can just use a SPV wallet.

The problem with that is that while a benevolent dictatorship is a good way to get shit done it's also centralized and fragile.
Transfer is possible with coinbase.  Withdraw icon at top right of screen in your CB wallet.
Yes you can transfer out of coinbase. But it requires quite some skill to safely keep the coins yourself. It sounds like you should be studying a bit more to learn about these things. I recommend letting coinbase manage your funds. Also don't sell. When you are ready to control your own funds buy a hardware wallet like a ledger nano s and a place to keep your words like cryptosteel. 
You need to get level 3 verification
Not sure tbh, maybe /u/vbuterin can let us know what he thinks is driving this change?
My guess is that it's a little of both. ETH has a reduction of issuance slated for around Jan 16th where block rewards will be reduced by a third. That's my two cents. 
Increasing strength of ETH

Indeed.
i absolutely think that the escrow supply should be calculated in. you can't argue that it hasnt been created yet, like in a POW scenario. lots of people look at cmc and misunderstand the real market cap of xrp

Is anybody using any those tokens outside of speculation? I’ve never heard of a single business or institution actually running critical operations on the public Ethereum blockchain.
First time people are positive about dilution 🤦
Vitali will make Ethereum decentralised, even if he has to do it singlehandedly.
"I don't think it would be smart to value Eth as a sum of all of its tokens, a lot of them are purposeless hype-riders or scam projects, their market caps aren't really indicative of anything since the ones that are still operating usually have a centralized supply.

It's a very popular choice, because it's one of the only choices.  I'm sure it will remain extremely competitive regardless of what happens in the market though, if only by its sheer lifespan and established history.  "
This would be interesting.
