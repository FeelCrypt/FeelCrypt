You know, if you actually considered others' POV's, you might actually change your mind.  Or - at least learn something.
"> I honestly doubt we are going to need to increase blocksize any time soon

This is exactly how the 1MB debacle started. We need an exact date and plan ASAP."
"> Uh yes it is. it grows until it saturates.

Stability that comes exclusively from adoption is not an intrinsic feature because it depends on external factors. It cannot be achieved with solely the inherent features of the technology.

>There's always cost at the intersection of fiat and crypto. So you have to pay the cost to get the crypto to send for free.

>Cryptocurrencies only ""provide secure international transactions at no cost"" if you were already holding them anyway.

>Get it??

You're describing an initial start-up cost. Not a repeated cost paid at every transaction.

You asked who would want to invest this start-up cost if BTC was inflationary, and I gave you the example: people who want to engage in international trade using BTC (both to buy and sell) so that they can avoid transaction costs.

It's not that complicated. The technology has plenty of desirable features that justify the start-up cost, but then it has one feature that actually penalizes spending -- which is the #1 function a currency needs to perform. That alone means that this is not a currency. 

>I do not see a negative adoption feedback loop represented here over any significant time period, adoption only seems to go up.

The negative feedback loop is not for adoption. It's for *volatility*. I thought that was plainly clear within context.

If major vendors refuse to adopt BTC because of the volatility, and BTC needs adoption to achieve stability, then this means that BTC is never going to stabilize.

>Yes, more and more people do this. Eventually, almost anyone investing money is doing at least some of this, if only as a hedge. And eventually when enough people are doing this, then over time the risk and reward will go down, and the variability will go down, and people will see it less as a get-rich-quick scheme and more as a sensible long term thing to hold.

So your fantasy here is that BTC is going to become a ""blue chip"" stock. That's the translation of what you just wrote.

Sorry, but this is delusional.

Stocks represent some kind of actual wealth or production or value that is generated in the economy by a company with actual working people doing actual tangible things.

Stocks don't become ""blue chip"" just because lots of people invest in it. That's not how they work. A stock becomes ""blue chip"" when the company itself grows large and builds a reputation for steady, reliable growth in its sector. That consistent history and reputation is what gives investors the confidence to hold the stocks as long term investments. The investment volume does not on its own produce confidence. The volume of investments is a *consequence* of the confidence that comes from the company's performance.

BTC is nothing like this. It has some $270 billion USD worth of market cap, and not a single penny of it is real wealth. It's 100% purely speculative, and it always will be, because it is not representative of any actual contribution to the world economy. There is no underlying product for which we can track performance of profits. There is no underlying company that can inspire long term confidence. It's just the latest imaginary value plaything of short-term investors. Note: the last imaginary value plaything were the mortgage backed derivatives, and they crashed the global finance sector.

>I guess lastly: why are you in this sub to begin with :)

I came in from /r/all. I saw a sensible redditor who recognizes BTC for what it is being downvoted to oblivion by apologists. I posted in support of the guy. And that turned into this conversation eventually. That's why."

You're really upset - did you get burned by BTC? Or are you just a straight up hater b/c you insist on not informing yourself? I'm trying to understand the disdain, here.
"
Troll someone else.
"Catch 22 though --- it's not going to ever get to the point where there is a vendor willing to trade in only bitcoin *because* of the problems right now.

Besides, it seems like BTC is sliding backwards. Steam fucked off and wont take it anymore... I'm sure they're not going to be alone."
"I guess that depends on your definition of fiat. If it is strictly government currency that has no commodity backing then yes it's not a fiat currency. But if your definition is simply currencies that only have value because people as a collective have decided they were valuable not because it has any intrinsic value itself then yes Bitcoin is fiat money.

Fiat essential means ""because I said so"". Bitcoin isn't money because a government ""said so"". *But*, it is money because people ""said so"". "
"I'm *so* impressed.  /s ;-)"
Wtf are u talking about? 
They should’ve switched to bcash.  No volatility. Always 1400-1600 range.
You're expecting to lose 13k and you're just fine with that. Investing is not for you.
Has anyone tried posting this on That Other Sub yet?  It's definitely Bitcoin news.
Troll someone else.
Oh because price volatility just started? No. Tx fees and a time, are the cause. If Bitcoin does not fix this how will it be a currency?
"Inflation may help in that one specific regard but it is an overall harm. It doesn't help people that the price of essentials like food increase at an exponential rate. The inflation is a hidden tax on people; as the central banks print, everyone is getting robbed of the value they worked so hard for *but* they don't know it because they had $100 yesterday and it'll still be $100 tomorrow, though the purchasing power diminishes.

I think it is at least as sinister as it sounds at face value. Enforcing the use of a single fiat currency is anti-free-markets and imo, it is ultimately a way to enslave the working class by making them work for worthless paper while enriching the ruling class. The example you provided is just one example of the wealthy .01% benefitting from a situation that made everyone else miserable."
"The sort by controversial used to be systematic back when /r/bitcoin was pro-big blockers, because they wanted the small block opinion to the top:

https://np.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/6rxw7k/informative_btc_vs_bch_articles/dl8v4lp/?st=jaotbt8m&sh=222ce783

They're just reusing an old technique"
"No, your conservative investing style isn’t for me. I have always done 50% 401k and spread between low and high risk funds. 

The other 50% I made a conscious choice to buy crypto. In the early days the engineering fascinated me as it continues to do. I never expected to go to the moon for real very quickly. I have always evangelized adoption and was big into p2p and changetip. 

This market took a very different turn and the coin is now useless, and I’m working on iota and bch because they are at least functional (iota is young), but hell yes I expected and expect to lose all BTC, but continue enjoying the gains. 

Cashing out half at every double has been fun. Speaking of which, when I started this thread BTC was at 10k and now it’s almost time for me to go cash out another half. "
"> I stopped reading there.

Not if I expected neither and expected to lose the 13k
Wait, I thought that all USD pairs on Bitfinex were actually Tethers?  They're not?
You are correct. :)
"Sorry it looks like I was wrong, I assumed the US government could take down any domain.

I imagine that while, the Justice Department lacks any mechanism to prevent Americans from visiting sites that are on a domain not controlled by a U.S. corporation, they could put a lot of pressure on Tongo."
Why would they need to? They offer USDT in their trading pairs, so it's obvious that the USDT accounts on their exchanges would not necessarily be their own.
rephrased: USDT was created by Tether Limited, Tether Holdings Limited, BFXNA Inc., iFinex Inc. for their own use.

"There's a TL;DR right on the post :)  

>**TL;DR** - Tether *(Tether Limited / Tether Holdings Limited)*, in partnership with Bitfinex *(BFXNA Inc. / iFinex Inc.)* is the sole user and trader of USDT across at least 3 major crypto exchanges (Bitfinex, Bittrex, Poloniex), controlling over 73% of USDT in circulation--623,000,000 of the total 844,000,000. While ~66% of USDT daily trade volume is on the BTC/USDT pair, USDT also happens to make up between 6% & 17% or more of daily BTC trading volume. "
Yeah, I agree, and that's not even taking into account leveraged trading that Bitfinex offers.
"> Technically, yeah I suppose it is.

I think it's a big deal.  There is this narrative that somehow USDT is propping up the bitcoin price, but nobody ever seems to say who would trade their bitcoin away for USDT.

Now you've just shown that nobody has traded away bitcoin for USDT; In fact, it is sitting idle in an address, not circulating.  

So again, both are not possible:  You can't prop up the price and have the USDT locked away."
"It does make sense, yes. Absolutely.  
But that's not what weirds me out. See, it would be normal to me, if these exchange wallets were belonging to the exchange itself, offering USDT for deposits. But transaction patterns and USDT flow between each wallet points to each of these exchange wallets being owned by one entity: Tether/Bitfinex.  

Further, it's not like these exchanges only take USDT as deposits. They accept all the other cryptocurrencies they offer in trading pairs. Why would anyone go through the hoops that Tether requires to attain USDT, only to use it as a deposit on an exchange, when you could much easier, and more anonymously, attain and deposit some other cryptocurrency instead?"
"There's no proof that one single USDT is backed by a USD as they claim. They also state on their own website that they're under no obligation to ever let you redeem your USDT for USD.

They can print tokens that are valued at $1 and technically have no value other than what they've claimed. They then pump it into Bitcoin which artificiality inflates the price."
Thanks for your input :)
Thank you!
I really appreciate that, thank you!
"If people are exchanging BTC for USDT and USDT is worth $0, then people are selling BTC for $0, effectively making BTC worth $0 - but only relative to USDT. The other option is that a USDT drop to $0 means Bitcoin's price relative to USDT would infinitely skyrocket ***relative to USDT***, since there aren't enough Tethers in existence to buy a single BTC. Other coins would probably be buying BTC for normal prices. **But all this is really a gross oversimplification of the entire cryptocurrency market. To be honest, man... I don't have the answer.** And I'm ok with saying that, I'm just a dude trying to figure this out like you. 

It may be like you said, that any kind of USDT collapse would be insulated to exchanges that mostly deal with it. I don't know how it would effect the market as a whole. I could take guesses, but that's all they'd be - guesses. But I'm here mostly to shed light on this murky water. I'm not yet ready to be projecting into the future with potential events and hazards."
Despite the opposite happening currently everytime BTC goes down.
Sorry bro, I'm not wrong. I don't think this is even a secret. It's fuckery no doubt, and BFX/Tether is scammy as hell and hiding things (like whether there really is any real USD backing anything) but this is not really a secret or one of the things they're hiding. You cannot deposit or withdraw USD from them, they are subject to US banking sanctions and cannot send or receive bank wires.  Whether they call it USD or USDT or BFX tokens on their platform doesn't matter since you can only withdraw them 1:1 for USDT, and can only deposit them 1:1 with USDT. 
"Bitfinex has a ""USD/USDT"" pair permanently pegged at 1.00 (unlike the pair at Kraken, which floats), and... wait for it... it's maintained due to the fact that nobody has withdrawn any USD from Bitfinex, _even now_, ~two weeks after they supposedly revealed their sketchy Polish ""bank"". So they can pretty much make up some fictional USD that's effectively just USDT due to the ""peg"". Except the fictional USD is meaningless because you can't get it, and will have to convert to USDT or BTC to get out. "
All USD trading on Bitfinex is actually USDT.  They used to offer real USD which is why they are listed on coinmarketcap as such, but they lost their bank.
Some random guy is writing numbers on a paper, and calling it money. He's telling everyone in town that it's money, even though it's not. It has become so trusted by the town, that banks have started accepting it for real money. This random guy who is scribbling numbers on paper to make his fake money, also controls 3/4 of its entire supply, which he has distributed across 3 separate banks. Now, almost 1/5 of all money transacted in the banks, is transacted in this random guy's fake money.
It's not like that money flow is abundantly transparent to us. All we can see is USDT moving around. We don't know what's happening in between, or in exchange for what. And for me that's frustrating, because I want to know more. The only thing we have are the addresses on the Rich List, and from there, transaction patterns between them. Beyond that, I don't know where to begin looking to understand why and how it's flowing.

The only connections I've drawn between USDT and BTC in this post has been relating to trading volume. That's it. I even explicitly stated in the post that I am not necessarily suggesting BTC is being propped up by USDT. This post is about profiting off fake money. Whether through arbitrage of purely USDT cross-exchange or buy-and-hold or any other strategy, I don't know. As for the How, and the What, I'm not there yet.
"Actually if what you're saying is true (and I believe it probably is), then I've already covered the implications of this adjustment in USDT's daily trading volume and its total (~17%) involvement in BTC's 24hr trading volume. Adding 2billion+ to Tether's daily trading volume increases its percentage of BTC's daily trading volume to nearly 1/5. That's pretty significant in my opinion.  

None of the post depends solely on this single point that Bitfinex doesn't trade USDT. I only shared this point as a stepping stone that got me curious enough to begin investigating. At that point, whether Bitfinex trades USDT or not, the post still makes sense."
"I appreciate your input, but this isn't a true TL;DR of my post. I've made it clear in my post that this is not the conclusion I am trying to come to. Although it could be loosely inferred that this is what's happening, I have stopped short of stating that USDT is pumping BTC, because I don't have evidence for it."
">So Bitfinex is printing tether and selling it to other exchanges for BTC

No, I'm not saying that. I'm saying that they own the tether addresses that exist on those exchanges. In other words, one entity controls 3 separate exchange wallets which contain Tether, totaling three quarters of all Tether in existence."
"> regulation

By free market. People will burn, then a few'll stop using USDT-like chains, the rest will burn and so on"
(good work OP by the way)
"Problem >> Reaction >> Solution   


**The Solution** banks want?  
Regulation.  

**The Reaction** banks need to enforce regulation?  
Protect my money from these out of control Wild West economics.  

**The Problem** banks need to create to induce that reaction?  
An out of control market that hurts a lot of people."
Friend, if this is true, then USDT makes up 17% of all 24hr BTC trading volume. Is there any official source we can view which verifies that all USD is transacted in USDT?
"Unfortunately, the volume of data points that form the whole picture is fairly large and spread out. I will admit that I compiled this information with quite a lot of effort, and it may be clear to you that I am not an academic. I'm just some guy.  And I did my best.  

It's such a deep rabbit hole that it was overwhelming to produce, keeping track of details and connecting dots. But that's why I placed a TL;DR at the bottom that you can easily read to understand the whole of what I was getting at. I pointed this out in the very first paragraph, so you at least had that to go on.

I will say this though... It should have been pretty apparent what I was suggesting by the time you reached the 3rd paragraph, which pretty much sums it up:  

>Tether, through Bitfinex (their own partner, arguably owned by the same company) is sending hundreds of millions of USDT to Bittrex and Poloniex accounts. This would be normal if it weren’t for the fact that all these accounts appear to be under control of Tether & Bitfinex directly.  

If you know of a better way to sum up the connections I've made in this post, which clearly do point to the conclusion that is made, please do not hesitate to share. Thanks for your feedback. :)"
"Why *WOULDN'T* there be recurring transactions?  These are the only people/companies who need to move tether.  What exactly are you alleging is happening here?  Why would polo and bittrex be okay with their names being on those addresses if they didn't control them?

Why would Bitfinex put other exchange's names on the addresses if bitfinex own them?

"Is that what they're doing? At this point their being actually backed, and their being printed out of thin air, are equally possible.  

However, I would point out their legal terms which explicitly outline the fact that Tether is worthless and does not represent money. So officially, Tether is not ""backed"" by anything."
"> or will bringing Bitcoin down also bring the alts down?

I've been burnt by this in the past. It's been my experience that btc's rise and fall is felt by all other cryptos."
Except financial institutions have the Fed as their lender of last resort. Tether is, on the other hand, running almost exclusively on goodwill, washtrading and market manipulation. 
"There are a couple major assumptions in that question: 1) that Tether is propping up BTC and 2) that when BTC futures open up, big banks will short it like crazy. I don't think we're yet at a place where we can 100% count on either assumption being true. So any investment decision based solely on them would be premature, in my opinion.  

That said, I am not here to offer trading advice. Only to bring awareness to the situation so that you can make a decision you feel most comfortable with. If that means liquidating into a crypto you feel more comfortable owning, or leaving crypto altogether, that's ultimately your call. :)"
Alts will also be affected.  All coins are still very correlated.
I really couldn't stop. Lost track of time, but it's been many days across a few weeks in the making. Thanks for taking the time.
"Poloniex is listed as one of Tether's ""Featured Partners"" on the Tether website, although they are ***not*** listed as a Tether Associate in Tether's legal terms. How one becomes a partner and doesn't understand what the coin itself really is, would be my question."
Cheers, friend. There is still plenty more to investigate, such as, beyond general USDT trading volume going into BTC, what percentage of USDT trading volume is done by Bitfinex/Tether directly. I don't know where to begin on that, it might be a task only suitable for a programmer to quantify.
"If you check out the Poloniex-A address, you'll see that there has been a ton of activity. USDT being sent to many different addresses. It's such an active account that 20 pages back into its history is only 20 hours old. One of Tether's proposed uses from its own website is to enhance arbitrage trading. I don't yet know *what* they're doing with the Tether, I only know what the data has told me: that they control 73% of it, and that *someone* is trading BTC/USDT on these exchanges, to the tune of over a billion dollars daily collectively, and possibly more (if Bitfinex is indeed using USDT and not actual USD). I'm not yet at the point of being able to accurately detail every granular aspect of how it's being done or by whom.  

And something u/imaginary_username has pointed out is that USDT is frequently being transferred to and from all of these exchange wallets. Which is something you do when you're engaged in arbitrage. USDT's value fluctuates against the USD and BTC frequently enough that it can be used as an exceptional arbitrage instrument. The main reason to maintain large USDT balances is so that your profits don't fluctuate with the BTC market while you're not trading. By quickly trading into and back out of BTC across multiple exchanges, while maintaining your USDT balance, you can see fairly stable profit. Plus, it's not like they don't hold BTC. Bitfinex-A currently holds over 82 BTC. The Bittrex account holds over 19 and Poloniex-A holds 2. Nothing earth-shattering. Thanks for sharing your inquisitiveness. I would love to have answers to these questions too. :)"
"This is what I fear. For all it's faults, Core is the most known, poster child of all of crypto. A negative public perception of Core could be devastating for for the whole ecosystem, no?

I'm a relative noob, so if this concern is wrong, which I hope it is, please ease my mind!"
I'm basing this statement off CoinMarketCap which currently shows zero USDT trading volume on Bitfinex. Instead, it's under USD. This would obviously skew the data, which I've gone over in the post.
Yes I also thought the same. All USD pairs on Bitfinex are actually USDT, but they don't tell you that. At least, I'm willing to come to this conclusion and avoid Bitfinex altogether.

Wow, thank you for the BCH goodness, kind stranger!
"Any time I've used Bittrex or Poloniex in the past, I had a unique address specific to myself, that I could look up on the blockchain and see my coins existing in. I've never heard of an exchange holding a lump sum, except in cases where exchanges were caught trading user balances.  

&nbsp;

>Assuming users came knocking on tethers door asking for the dollars, and assuming Tether has the dollars in reserve, all is good?

&nbsp;

All is not good.  
Observe Tether's legal terms:  

> Tethers are not money and are not monetary instruments. They are also not stored value or currency. There is no contractual right or other right or legal claim against us to redeem or exchange your Tethers for money. We do not guarantee any right of redemption or exchange of Tethers by us for money."
bitcoinruby.io is far away from tether luckily. might be cool to check out the launch 
"There's likely only one way USDT ""resolves"" itself and that resolution is the collapse of Bitfinex and Poloniex and Bitrex. This needs to be followed up with more grown-up and bonafide exchanges that act like Gemini."
Solid work and reasoning by OP! It is scary to think of the consequences on the crypto ecosystem when this eventually gets resolved. It is imperative to keep your money out of exchanges and holding on to your private keys!
"You're making two massive assumptions in your post. 

The scenario where USDT is not responsible for ""propping up BTC's price"" and big banks instead decide to go long BTC is also a possibility. 

If you are able to accurately predict which scenario is more likely please share with the group!"
"I search for an official source but I can't find one.  But then there are so many people that claim the USDT is being used to pump the price of Bitcoin on Bitfinex...  All these alarming articles/posts I see seem to imply USDT is used for all pairs instead of USD.  I'll keep on searching and share my findings if any.

"
It is murky indeed... which is primarily what I wish to point out (the murkiness). That said, I'm not yet confident enough to start accusing them of money laundering or other serious crimes. That's a heavy accusation that I feel would deserve a ton more direct evidence. And I don't think we're there yet.

Unfortunately I don't have the answers to either of those questions. The least we can do as a community though, is to bring attention to the situation so that people are made aware. I don't even know whose jurisdiction this would fall under. My guess is some Asian or European regulator, which appear to be the locations for these companies.
As long as they are actually sending the USD they get from trading when they buy the tethers this seems to be okay right?  The only issue comes if they are double spending the money.  No proof they are or are not though.  
Interesting you bring up debt-based cryptos. Because that's what lightning-network would effectively create. An entire debt-based transaction network made of IOUs.

I think you're mistaken about how exchanges work, unless there's something different about USDT I'm not aware of. Trades definitely do occur between exchange and user when depositing and withdrawing funds, and trades that happen within the exchange are *not* happening on-chain. That's why you can quickly and easily sell DCR for BTC and then withdrawing BTC to another wallet takes 2 hours.

"For the first 2 points, you have a valid concern, but that is nothing new. I'm struggling to see why point 3 is relevant. Given that tether is only backed by a trust that the people behind tether will pay out, what is the benefit for tether 'owned' by other people to ever move it off of bitfinex? Of course they 'control' most of it.

I'm still struggling to understand why anyone would risk their assets in tether in the first place."
"> this Tether scam

Perhaps this is the normal operating procedure in the financial industry, but only easier to discover and expose due to the nature of Bitcoin's public ledger."
r/bitcoin is currently #155 subreddit and constantly growing as any other cryptosub. No doubt it will hit top 100 soon. They definitely care about a sub that big.
Pretty sure 99% or r/all has no idea what a tether is.

Thanks man - appreciate your research!
I concur. Thanks again for your .02 USD u/tippr
They don't have cold wallets?  They sure as hell aren't doing atomic swaps between every crypto imaginable.
You lost me... if they offer a trading pair for a cryptocurrency, why would they not have an account in that cryptocurrency that they control? It would be necessary for any off-exchange transactions.
Great work! Scary. If this is indeed true, when this printing/Ponzi scheme is exposed, we should expect a Mt. Gox situation, but this time with multiple exchanges closing. Definitely expect it on exchanges that deal exclusively with USDT.
Meaning its not really used to be traded for other assets its just used to move stuff around and buy things and pretend its legit?  
You did good work. This is my way of saying thanks.
I appreciate it, but maybe could I trouble you for an ELI5?
Awesome, thank you!
">However, I would point out their legal terms which explicitly outline the fact that Tether is worthless and does not represent money. So officially, Tether is not ""backed"" by anything.

If they didn't have those terms, Tether would be subject to KYC which is exactly what they're trying to avoid."
Ah, so it is out of circulation, in the usual monetary sense of the word?
US government will be involved as it relates to the US dollar and tether has a domain that can be seized.
That is interesting indeed... it feels overwhelming how much stuff there is to look into these days. Thanks for your input :)

"Well first, I want to emphasize that money laundering is not something I'm trying to suggest here. That's a very serious crime and I don't think there's enough evidence here to begin thinking in those terms.  

I'm no money laundering expert, but I'm pretty sure the only way to tax BTC is to get institutions that offer BTC exchanging services to divulge customer use information (*cough* Lightning Network *cough*). There are other ways to turn BTC into cash than via direct means, as well (Tether, perhaps?)."
"Well if you read their blog posts from April/June of this year you can read about it. They were cut off from US banks and stopped accepting USD deposits or withdrawals.  They're subject to banking sanctions and so can't receive bank wires because those have to go through US correspondent banks even for foreign accounts. If there's no way to move USD in or out, and you can only deposit or withdraw USDT, and they trade ""USD"", it's not a secret that USD on their platform = USDT. On their platform its all just entries in their database, they could call it USD, USDT or anything else.  But if you want to deposit or withdraw it's USDT that you do it with. "
I appreciate what you are saying, but for your research to have any weight you should try to imply what this means. What is the implication of this centralization in tether?
That may be. I'm not great with the Wiki CMS, so I'd leave that up to someone who felt led to do so, if it got there. Feel free, anyone! Thank you, updated the info. :)
I don't think they care... This subreddit is nothing to them.
"I wanted to wait 2 weeks for any statement on this. Something this sensitive has to be thoroughly examined before reddit makes any moves. I understand that.

Well, 2 weeks is up and I have not heard anything. We don't just have to keep the issue in mind, but actually demanding at least some comment from reddit. I don't know how to proceed with this though. Just PMing the people in charge will definitely not result in any answer."
"I agree, the address is owned by the exchange, but the quantity of coin you have on that address is still accurate. They don't hold it in one lump sum on a single address.  

No I'm not suggesting that they are untraded. Just looking at Poloniex-A and Bittrex, their 20 pages of history goes back only to 20 hours ago. That's a lot of trading activity. Clearly there is a lot of trading going on.

If it weren't for the recurring transaction patterns between all these addresses, I'd think all was normal. But because of these patterns, it is apparent that Bitfinex may be the sole operator of all the addresses mentioned in the post."
"ELI5:  Exchanges can't directly hold US dollars. So instead they have digital monopoly money that represents a dollar. These dollars can be bought with Bitcoin or sold for Bitcoin.   
This monopoly money is Tether. It comes in infinite supply and Bitfinex, a large trading exchange is able to create as much of this monopoly money as they like. Other large trading exchanges, like Bittrex and Poloniex both feature Tether as well but they get it all from Bitfinex.   
OP has discovered that most of this monopoly money is used by a single person/group and makes up a really large part of daily trading. "
"Tethers (called USDT like how Bitcoin is called BTC), are being printed at huge amounts, hundreds of million amounts. They are each worth one dollar and this price is supposedly backed by Tether themselves.

People use this money to buy Bitcoin, so you have hundreds of millions of new money going into Bitcoin, driving the price of it up. You can see the price correlation with the manufacturing of Tethers on a timeline graph too.

Eli5: people using Monoploy game dollars to buy stocks higher than they should be. Aka inflated price and impending huge price drop. "
Dude I want you to be wrong soooo bad. This would increase the USDT volume to nearly 1/5 of BTC's daily trading volume. The only thing I would love to see is some kind of official word on how USD is transacted on Bitfinex.
hell no, if btc goes down it would bring all of crypto with it, 
That doesn't even make sense.  Bitfinex consistently lags most other exchanges, because they offer shorts.  They're 6% below Cex.io, for instance.
"Thanks for your help, friend. Would be much appreciated. I have not heard anything about USDT representing USD on exchanges from an official source either. To me, if it's BTC/USD, then it's USD. It would be so wrong, in my opinion, to offer ""USD"" as USDT and not tell anyone. I don't have all the answers, I'm just some guy on the internet trying to figure out why this doesn't make sense. "
Considering Bitfinex's history and run-ins with trading laws, this is really troubling.
Just another comment on /u/peptocurrency argument that USDT trading (if it includes USD on finex) might make up 17% of daily BTC trading. I find this the real headline here. So far many people have dismissed the possibility of BTC price manipulation by Bitfinex because surely this would be to difficult now that BTC is so large. At first glance $800 million in USDT seems like a drop in the bucket. That´s why I find this the most compelling argument in this. At 17% of daily volume driving the price in any direction you want is possible beyond a doubt.
"Bittrex is also a very active address. Its 20-page history only goes back 20 hours.  

Edit: apologies, I thought I was replying to someone else. Bittrex does not appear to be one of Tether's featured partners."
Tether is backed by the belief that USDT is backed by USD which in theory Bitfinex/Tether have in a bank account somewhere.  Do they have enough money to back all the USDT they print? Maybe...I have no idea.  It really depends more on that question than anything else.
[deleted]
If I'm honest about my gut feeling, this is mine as well. But I still maintain the rationale that beyond my gut feeling, I don't yet have the concrete proof.
It went down, alts went up, just today.  It's happened the same for the past month or so.
I thought the same. It's possible that this is the case.
"Oh, so "".to"" is US-jurisdiction? I'm murky on whether Tether's legal terms would make USDT a US matter. It states that Tether is not money, and does not represent money. Tether has been used 1:1 with Euros as well."
"Technically, yeah I suppose it is.  
But that's not the definition I was trying to use. :)  
Thanks for clearing that up."
Yeah I know. The 30 million just triggered my memory because wasn't that the amount associated with the Tether breach a few weeks back? Don't want to spread any FUD or anything, but it seems like a bit of a coincidence that the amount in a quarantined account matches the amount in the breach.
A company grants itself the super-power of printing free money (previously a power only available to the Federal Reserve) which they can use to purchase real-world things of actual value. Meanwhile the claim is that it's a new type of service backed 1:1 by the USD with zero proof. At the same time they control 3/4 of its supply, all of which is being used on exchange accounts they own. It could be that I'm the dense one, but why wouldn't that concern me?
I couldn't agree more on that front. I've actually seen that post, and it is easily inferred to people like you or I that they now transact in USDT instead of USD, but they stop short of actually saying it, which is the only thing that a lot of people would accept as an official word unfortunately.
I've stopped short of implications just to get a clear footing on the murkiness of the situation itself. But if I were going to take the next step, I would begin looking at how USDT makes up almost 1/5 of the 24hr BTC trading volume, and ask who controls the majority of that volume. Unfortunately, I can't make that leap yet. I haven't established a way to connect individual Tether transactions with exchanges of coin, vice/versa, or I would begin trying to connect those dots.
"As per my last sentence I am aware of this and it's of great concern.

R.e. The address, yes it is specific to you but it's not owned by you. Once the coins are in that address, if you buy and sell on the exchange, you'll note that address still has the original coins you deposited.

You're not suggesting that the balances in those accounts are just sitting there untraded and in the control of bitfinex are you? Those addresses are owned by the exchanges. Of course bitfinex will have used the tethers to buy other assets,  as part of the portfolio they offer their shareholders.

Tethers are junk by any legal standing as they are not obligated to redeem, and no third party is going to exchange real dollars for tethers when Tether holders lose confidence in it."
"Because I don't think there's enough *direct* evidence of it yet. We have some nebulous details, like the fact that USDT trades about 17% of BTC's daily trading volume, and that Tether/Bitfinex are in control of over 3/4 of Tether in existence. One could put those two points together and conclude something nefarious.  

But I don't yet have a way to point at any given Tether transaction and say, ""Here's where it turns into BTC, or vice/versa."" I wanted to stick purely to things that can be substantiated and get to implications at a later time. But (and I'm not surprised) most of us in this thread seem to have a gut feeling about USDT's involvement in BTC's price."
"It actually goes longer than bitfinex itself. Remember BTC-e, the sketchy as hell exchange that has a permanent discount on coins (just like finex), suspected to be the ""mafia exchange"", and got shut down by the feds? Yup, in its final days it offered USDT as a ""withdrawal"" method due to lack of banking  and imminent run. 

So if you count BTC-e as part of that ""history"" it can go back to 2011. :3"
As I was reading through his description it just sounds like this is a way provide liquidity to various exchanges. Very similar to the mechanisms in place at large financial institutions. 
"It 100% is SOP for global finance, and it (analogous methods anyway) is how they extract rent from the rest of the economy. 

But bitcoin doesn't own every single media corporation and most politicians in the western world to tell everyone that it's perfectly normal... "
"> People use this money to buy Bitcoin, so you have hundreds of millions of new money going into Bitcoin, driving the price of it up.

but who sell their bitcoin for tethers and why? surely they must have heard as much as us about them?"
"Go do it, we may even want a wiki if the info volume gets out of hand. o_O

Edit: 1MZAayfFJ9Kki2csoYjFVRKHFFSkdoMLtX doesn't just recycle Polo USDT, it also recycles Bittrex. "
"> Exchanges can't directly hold US dollars.

I'm confused by this. I've got USD being held on Gdax..."
Totally swept under the rug. Let's not forget!
Welp, Bitfinex will probably issue OP a cease and desist, as well as a lawsuit threat.
im here from Popular
"> OP has discovered that most of this monopoly money is used by a single person/group and makes up a really large part of daily trading. 

Maybe.  I also don't see what the big deal is?  I really don't understand why he draws the conclusion these addresses are all owned by bitfinex?

Those exchanges would say something, right?  They would be like why the fuck do you put our names on those addresses?

The only reason he says they're owned by bitfinex is because ""Why would an exchange buy tethers?"".  That's pretty easy to answer, because it gets rid of regulatory bullshit and they offer USDT so of course they hold tethers.

I really don't get what he's trying to say here at all.  I feel like OP took too much Adderall.  What exactly is he alleging?"
"If/when it reaches /r/all, a primer on who/what Tether, Bitfinex, Bittrex, and Poloniex are and what they do, plus what exactly USDT is would be of huge help. 

I have a very elementary understanding of all of this, so my attempts at andy ELI5 would only mislead. "
"Someone should made ELI5 for r/all

^(As noob user, I honestly don't understood much of OP said)"
USD on bitfinex is USDT. It's not listed as such on coinmarketcap because they used to have real USD until wells fargo cut them off. It's an error or remnant of a time long since past on CMC.  Polo and Bittrex never had usd and so call their pairs USDT pairs.  Bitfinex calls it USD, but it's really USDT.  You cannot deposit or withdraw USD from them, only USDT. 
[deleted]
Cheers, thanks for that, kind stranger.
"Because trades don't occur between exchange >> user. They occur between user >> user. The exchange doesn't need a reserve, they're more of a 3rd party facilitator for the activity of trading. User-A buys BTC for USDT, while User-B sells USDT for BTC. user A now owns USDT. User B now owns BTC. When they want to withdraw, there's no problem, because it's theirs. They own it. The problem arises when an exchange starts trading user funds. Or equally as bad, trading within their own exchange, manipulating prices against its users. (This occurs frequently in the Forex markets).  

Next, assuming exchanges *do* carry some kind of reserve (they have to profit after-all), they likely get that reserve from exchange fees and services (not to be confused with transaction fees).  

Next, let's say an exchange *does* want to hold its own reserve, not built off fees. Just their own private stash to trade with.   

It doesn't make sense that these accounts belong to these exchanges, because of the transaction patterns present across all these addresses. The patterns we can see across all these addresses all point to Tether/Bitfinex owning them."
"good read, thx!

It also helps them avoid a hell of a lot more - like potential litigation as a result of personal and/or commercial economic damages.
"Isn't it extremely inefficient to launder money through BTC in the US, because the IRS views BTC as property not currency/income and it is taxed as such?

However, I suppose if one had enough money to artificially and quickly inflate the price of BTC, then cash out it could be cost efficient."
BTC's last rise only caused the alts to go down. So i'm not sure what will happen if BTC goes down now.
Some random guy is writing numbers on a paper, and calling it money. He's telling everyone in town that it's money, even though it's not. It has become so trusted by the town, that banks have started accepting it for real money. This random guy who is scribbling numbers on paper to make his fake money, also controls 3/4 of its entire supply, which he has distributed across 3 separate banks. Now, almost 1/5 of all money transacted in the banks, is transacted in this random guy's fake money.
"one way to think about it is: 

1. make up this USDT thingy
2. use it to prop up the BTC price. 
3. sell your BTC for a lot of real world USD to people who suffer from FOMO
4. profit!



"
Thanks it's just my gut feeling that this is a planned attack on Bitcoin because their segwit2x plan failed. 
That is a good thing. Those projects that cant sustain themselves will crash and burn meanwhile the legit good ones with potential will survive. It will be cut throat once the crash hits but a few survivors will emerge like always. Your job and mine is to try to find those out before everyone else.
"I guess the question is where the money will go during the recovery.

I think a portfolio diversified between a few major coins is going to weather this storm and come out positive, but you have to have the guts to hodl."
They've been doing the opposite lately.  Is nobody else noticing this?  BTC goes down, major alts go up, and vice-versa.

"First, let me say that I forgot to thank you for your research and original post before I submitted my comment. Clearly there are enough breadcrumbs to say with certainty that there is something fishy and it´s work like yours and Bitfinex´ed that is helping putting the pieces together. Especially with the BTC price so overextended a Tether / Bitfinex collapse could create a Mt. Gox like 2013 scenario that will plunge the whole crypto market into another winter. Your point of arbitrage trading makes sense to me, someone pointed out in a post several days ago that Giancarlo Devasini replied on bitcointalk in 2014 that he was working on an arbitrage bot. Bitfinex´ed also points out: ""The ‘Chief Strategy Officer’ of Bitfinex, Phil Potter runs a Bitcoin arbitrage hedge fund"" in this post https://medium.com/@bitfinexed/fake-it-till-you-make-it-when-bitfinex-themselves-used-to-spoof-their-entire-orderbook-18294585338

Still, the pieces of the puzzle don´t fit together yet, but these are definetely some (probably not all) of the pieces. I thought it would be interesting to list them to build a mindmap to see how they fit and what´s missing
* USDT minting scam
* arbitrage trading
* bitfinex uses wash trades to prop up their order book - to look like largest BTC exchange
* covering losses from bitfinex hack to stay afloat

I´m missing a ponzi component. Why? If they have a working arbitrage bot, then all is well - they make money - everyone is happy. 

Why do they keep minting new USDT and attract scrutiny and thus jeopardize the stability of both Bitfinex and Tether.
There seem to be only 2 answers:
- Greed. Because they want more money. Seems not likely to me as this has reached a level where surely all material needs are met for the people who got in on the ground floor.
- Instability. They have to mint more because otherwise the whole thing will blow up.  Something isn´t working, or something is burning so much money that it requires a constant flow of new cash. 
This is to me the missing component. Where is the instability in this setup and what is the need / motivation to mint more USDT and keep pushing the BTC price up.

They have built 2 massive, mainstream projects. Why would they gamble?

"I think that this further evidence that Tethers aren't created in response to legit deposits into Tether.io's bank by unknown partys, but instead created out of thin air at the behest of Bitfinex.

If they are real customers, shouldn't the tethers be paid out to a much larger set of addresses that act independently? "
Nope, your concern is well founded. You hit the nail on the head. 
It's a concern, however ETH and BCH seem to be moving the *opposite* to BTC recently.  BTC goes down, ETH and BCH go up, just happened today again.  I hope this continues when BTC dead cat bounces.

There are very few legit exchanges that are licensed to trade USD and /or other fiat currencies. The ones I know are Kraken, GDAX, Gemini and Bitstamp. Bitfinex, on the other hand, probably deals in USDT even though they call it USD.
"Alts are tied to BTC and would undoubtedly incur massive losses in such a scenario. Here's how you protect yourself from a crash. 

1. The CFTC recently approved the listing of crypto derivatives. This means you can hedge against price drops in the capital markets. OKex also includes these products, although I'm not sure if they can actually honor the contracts in case of a market collapse. Perhaps you should consider buying call options for 2-3 months ahead of time.
2. Alternatively, you can cash out all your bitcoins into USD, which means you have close to zero risk (hold them on Coinbase where you're covered by the FDIC guarantee). Then buy call options that allow you to purchase bitcoins at a certain price (hopefully at discount), with no obligation to execute. That way your money is safe (stored in fiat), and you still won't miss the train if BTC keeps climbing.

Risk mitigation is key here.....as with everything else. Hope this helps."

"I know it sounds crazy to you, but there is actually very little reason for any of the USDT to be printed ""out of thin air"" (as opposed to being ""backed""). The hundreds of millions of dollars to serve as backing can be borrowed and put up in T-bills for a tiny fraction of their value - maybe some hundreds of thousands per year.

The USDT then continue on as a method of settlement between exchanges."
At a work christmas party now so can't investigate but could the 30 mill USDT in the 31okFF address not be the actual tether that was hacked? Wasn't that 30 million? and thus the other address is in quarantine because it holds the hacked tether?
"Could it be money laundering? I always tought this set-up would be a GREAT way to bring back dirty money in circulation ie: the ""deposits"" to reserves could be dirty money - and when they ""lose"" tethers (hacks), money goes back to wherever. So a hack is actually beneficial!

This is so murky..."
Bittrex = **Bit**finex **T**ethe**r** **Ex**change?
So if tether is artificially propping up the Bitcoin price and the big banks selling futures are going to short Bitcoin like crazy what should we do? Should I cash out and wait for it to crash or keep all my money in alts, or will bringing Bitcoin down also bring the alts down? 
Incredible read. Thanks for your time putting this together 
More people should know about this, hope it gets the attention of more users.
Great analysis. Is it possible Polo and Bittrex don't really know what's going on and just see it as a legit crypto?

Your primary implication that Bitfinex does not use tether is dead wrong.  Coinmarketcap lists Bitfinex pairs as USD but they are in fact USDT.  So basically this whole post doesn't make much sense. 
Point 3 is relevant because currently USDT makes up nearly 1/5 of BTC's daily trading volume. If we know who controls most USDT, we may (emphasis on *may*) have a clue as to who transacts the majority of BTC/USDT. 
"So because Bitfinex somehow owns a bunch of cryptocurrency on a completely seperate network, that has anything to do with bitcoin how? 

Let's say tether completely disappears tomorrow... Whoever has Bitcoin will still have Bitcoin, why would they just suddenly all want to sell just because some other currency they don't even own has dissapeared?"

Awesome research! There seems to be too many variables and undiscovered information to make solid conclusions thus far. It is truly compelling though.

Woah.
You should also mention the 30million dumped tether into a known hackers account as an inside job.
If those accounts *aren't* owned by Bittrex and Poloniex, why wouldn't they have released a statement denouncing the assocations?

"I'm afraid this is poorly written. It's hard to tell what you are even trying to prove. When someone writes 'Wait there's more' at a point when they haven't even proven anything yet, it's a bad sign. It means they think they are proving things when they are not.

Maybe I am just dense. Perhaps opening with a thesis statement summing up everything you intend to prove before you prove it, would help. There is a reason thesis statements are standard practice in the academic world. I just don't have the patience to slog through something as long and sloppily written as this, on the vague hope that maybe at some point it will come to an explicit conclusion. There is a lot of work to do before this evidence shapes up into an effective presention that can persuade anyone of anything.

Great research. Thanks.
">Am I saying BTC is being propped up by Tether? I haven't gotten that far yet. Is 6% to 17%+ of daily BTC trading volume enough to move its price? I don't know.

Easily. People make fun of this notion because they think that the amount of tethers would never be able to move the price, which is true. But it absolutely could be if they bought at key times, like when the price dips. Which makes it look like the coin will only keep rising since they prop it up at every dip, which incentivizes more buying. 

"
Thanks for the in-depth analysis.
"If the goal of Tether is to get USD (to back it), and USDT is valuable to crypto exchanges like Bittrex and Poloniex because they can't deal with USD directly, then doesn't it kind of make sense that the USDT would go there, being traded for cryptos that can then be exchanged for USD?

I don't see much of a malicious conspiracy here.  Yes, they are probably skirting regulations in some abstract sense, but the regulations are poorly-conceived obviously."
">So, here's what's insane to me: 1. Bitfinex holds USDT on their exchange, yet doesn’t offer USDT in any of their trading pairs. That's insane to me because Bitfinex is the only Associate of Tether in Tether's legal terms. If they do offer USDT, they're calling it USD which is sketchy as hell. 

It may be sketchy but that's the truth -- it's not a secret or surprising.  I don't think they say otherwise.  The CMC volume is not accurate (it used to be, but it isn't now).  In reality, all ""USD"" trading on bitfinex is USDT.  It's just that they used to offer real USD trading and the volume tracking was never updated.  Bitfinex doesn't allow actual withdrawals or deposits of dollars.  The whole premise of this article is off base: yes, USD on bitfinex is USDT, everyone should know that.  How are so many people surprised by this at this stage of the game?!"
"Fair enough.

Regardless, thank you for the info."
It's scams like this that will bring regulation into cryptos somehow. I hoped those behind this get banged up for a long time rather than vanishing off to live on their own island.
So Bitfinex is printing tether and selling it to other exchanges for BTC, in order to inflate BTC's price, but I thought this was common knowledge?
"So what are you actually trying to say?

Tether/Bitfinex owns every wallet, and they put tethers in each one based on how much the exchanges buy?

Who cares?  Why is that so bad?

I also don't see how your analysis indicates that that is what's happening either.  Bitfinex would send them specifically because, as you said, they are basically Tether.  Why is that weird?"
"Great research. 
/u/fairlaytip 3mBCH"
"Tether is a horrible scam.  I have never purchased it I will never hold inside of it and my coins will never touch it if I have them. Its a mess I want no part of!

Thanks for this research!"
For a brief second I hoped this title was subredditsimulator. Alas.
Solid investigative work, u/peptocurrency
This is real fucking journalism
No worries! I am not completely up on the latest domain jurisdictions. Thanks for looking into it :)
Dude you need to create a private crypto investigation business! Or something like that.
What are the implications though? Are cryptocurrency values being artificially inflated? Or does this mean tether holders are gonna get burned when things get bad?
I see this making it to /r/all easily.
">  1) Bitfinex does not offer or trade USDT. Tell me what random soul out there is privately selling hundreds of millions of USDT worth of goods or services directly to Bitfinex, only to send their USDT revenue to Bittrex?

I was under impression that all of Bitfinex's USD pairs were USDT. Is there a Eurotether as well?"
 imagine if all this were on a private side chain lightening network, you couldn't trace it if they didn't want you to
"Anyone know if reddit has made any statement on the last one yet?

[Evidence that the mods of /r/Bitcoin may have been involved with the hacking and vote manipulation ""attack"" on /r/Bitcoin.](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7eil12/evidence_that_the_mods_of_rbitcoin_may_have_been/)

It has been over 2 weeks now. Are they still investigating this? Almost any kind of statement would be okay by me: 1) If they say that the evidence is inconclusive/wrong and explain why. 2) Or actually acknowledge and agree with the problem.

Silence and just ignoring the findings does not show reddit in a good light."
What scares me the most in crypto is that we may be in the middle of a big manipulation scheme and we can only hope that we are not :)
it has happened only because they share minning resources and theres politics and profiting around it, nothing related to exchange scams
"This is pretty much what happens in the art market, where prices increase mostly because a group of ultramillionaries just wanted to avoid taxes

"That's the thing, something in me feels you're right. And it all makes sense and adds up. So many people though, trust this established system we have and will only wait for an ""official"" voice to say ""Yes, we only transact in USDT."" But man, honestly, I don't doubt what you're saying. It is only for lack of that ""official"" word I can reference, that I haven't yet conclusively stated this in my post. Thank you for your input, friend!"
The sooner this Tether scam is resolved the better. Thank you for this research.
">These are the only people/companies who need to move tether.  

Yeah. Tether & Bitfinex. You're right.  

>Why would polo and bittrex be okay with their names being on those addresses if they didn't control them?

For the same reason Coinbase would be cool with their name on an address that contained 1,000 LTC. That's where the LTC is being stored. At Coinbase.  

You're assuming that the name on the address is the designation of who owns it. But what my post has laid out, is that these addresses are named after the location of where the most Tether exists, not who owns it.  

If the names represented who owns it, we'd see Tether's Rich List as:

Tether Limited  
Tether Limited  
Tether Limited  
Tether Limited  

>Why would Bitfinex put other exchange's names on the addresses if bitfinex own them?  

Because it's a shnazzy little feature on Tether's website to designate where the most Tether currently exists. It's marketing. Having one name on all the addresses isn't nearly as interesting or effective for adoption as listing multiple different names, bringing attention to exchanges that currently transact in USDT. Plus, it would sketch people out to see Tether Limited as the sole owner of nearly all Tether in existence."
I said it many times, but I like to say it again: Get your coins out of Bitfinex! Avoid this exchange! Don't get blinded by their slick trading engine and high volume. Don't use Tether. Seriously, it will end terrible for the entire crypto world, but especially for those still using Bitfinex and their scam coin.
I'm a bit confused. Surely once it's in a Bittrex or Polo address, you cannot determine ownership of the Tether. It's possibly been sold on those exchanges and is thus internally accounted for, distributed across many accounts. The Tether will likely remain in that initial account unless users attempt to withdraw usdt which they will very rarely do as it's just used as a parking instrument on those exchanges. Assuming users came knocking on tethers door asking for the dollars, and assuming Tether has the dollars in reserve, all is good? But the main concern is there is no evidence of that and no requirement to redeem.

Wow. This is a wealth of useful information. Here’s to hoping the eventual collapse of BTC doesn’t fuck it up for the cryptos you can actually use. 
U/iotatippr tip this man please
"It's in the legal terms where it explicitly states:

>Tethers are not money and are not monetary instruments. They are also not stored value or currency. There is no contractual right or other right or legal claim against us to redeem or exchange your Tethers for money. We do not guarantee any right of redemption or exchange of Tethers by us for money.  

How much more clear does it get? This ***directly contradicts*** what their website says on the front-freakin-page: that Tether is backed 1:1 by USD. So which is it?? This creates a skewed view of the value of USDT. Later in the legal terms, Tether and Bitfinex are both held legally irresponsible for any ***skewed perception of USDT's value as a result of claims made on either of their websites.***

So they are literally saying, ""We can claim USDT is worth $1. But it's not, really. And if you suffer economically as a result of believing it's worth $1, it's not our fault, because we said it's not actually worth anything in these terms of service.""

Lastly, comes the issue of audits. Their front page again claims they'll be audited frequently. They have not once been audited since their inception in 2014. Funny that nowhere on their legal terms page is the word ""audit"" mentioned."
"While an exchange would definitely collect USDT fees, why would ""Bittrex"" the exchange send USDT to ""Poloniex""'s private fee address?"
If these transanctions are have questionable natures, why do you think Bitfinex or the higher entity would reveal all their money flows in public for you and everyday joe to investigate? What's preventing them from making completely hidden transactions underground (i.e. transferring private keys directly) so that no one can be ever sure where the money is? I am all for hardcore journalism, but I don't think analyzing omniexplorer is the way to go, as it can be pretty misleading and quite questionable in terms of revealing shady activities.
ELI5 ?
"When you deposit or withdraw to/from an exchange, there is no ""exchange"" that occurs. You've simply moved money from one wallet to another. The exchange didn't give you anything. That's why you have to wait for confirmation. And I never said trades happen on-chain within exchanges. Just user-to-user."
"what I don´t understand and assuming Tether is unbacked and some scam (which seems close to proven): When Tether / Bitfinex mints new USDT they themselves know that they are worthless. Why would they keep the USDT balance? Wouldn´t they immediately sell them for something with real value like BTC? 

Even if the idea is to wash trade back and forth manipulating BTC price with huge trading volume, the USDT balance shouldn´t be 73% as something like half of the assets would be in BTC at any given time. But why would they maintain large USDT balances?
Wouldn´t it be a simpler and better scam to just print useless USDT, sell them for BTC and hodl them?

It has been suggested by Bitfinex´ed that this started as a hail marry solution to prevent Bitfinex from going under after the hack. But wouldn´t they have made enough money to cover losses and then some. If they sold their $800 million USDT into BTC over the past months there must be a profit in the billions somewhere..."
If they are, CoinMarketCap.com doesn't give an accurate view of USDT trading volume. And the scenario in my post would unfortunately become a reality.
lol
I never said it was being propped up. I lined this out right inside the post that this is ***not*** the conclusion I'm trying to come to. It can be inferred, but there isn't enough evidence. I also never said it's just sitting there on all the wallets. Poloniex-B seems to be the only address where nothing is happening (yet). However, Bitfinex-A, Bitfinex-B, Poloniex-A and Bittrex all have a significant amount of trading activity happening.
Sigh i hate when people post shit like this and dont put their money where their mouth is. I am margin short on tether from 1.04 if you believe its shady you should be shorting it.

While that may be true, I do not care.  Maybe that's where it is at the moment, but we can probably agree that is not the intent of bitcoin.

I like bitcoin, I've made money off of bitcoin, and I see it still growing exponentially.  That's where my concerns end. 

 I see BCH as a cheap knock off of BTC, and that's about it.  This toxic ass sub is a big turn off to BCH, and Roger Ver annoys me to no end.  He reminds me of a Joel Osteen type, and his ""I'm a millionaire"" routine is insulting.  And the whole ASICBOOST thing is concerning to say the least.

Good luck on BCH, I want no part of it.  I do have my hand in probably a dozen cryptos, I have very little confidence in BCH.  I love watching the price of BTC go up, and hope that it continues, I don't see it stopping any time soon.  Once BTC figures out transaction fees and time, BCH is in for a world of hurt.

"Depending on how many miners leave, it might take way more than days; when everything is fine, it takes 2 weeks for an adjustment, but if for example, 50% of the miners leave, that will take about a month (that is, if the miners leave right after an adjustment; if they leave more in the middle of the cycle, while the time till the next adjustment might be smaller, the adjustment itself will also be smaller, keeping the average block rate still slower than the target for a whole'nother cycle)."

How would that work? How would you enforce the pegging?
You can not scale Bitcoin to millions of microtransactions per second for billions of people and machines by making the blocks bigger. It‘s impossible. You would need Petabyte blocks that can not be broadcast and validated within 10 minutes. Networks are always scaled by 1) optimization 2) extensions 3) additional layers. That’s how the internet continues to reach better scaling for decades now. In Bitcoin Segwit is the optimization. Sidechains are the extensions. Lightning is an additional layer. And none of them „kill the decentralized state.“
I'm bullish on BCH right now. Although you can't count out Dogecoin at this point.
"Bitcoin will emerge victorious in the end; but it will not be what the media is calling ""Bitcoin"" today, that's not the real the real Bitcoin.

Bitcoin has survived attacks before, but that was when it hadn't been sabotaged from the inside; but fortunately, in spite of the temporary loss of the brand, Bitcoin has managed to escape the sabotage and is once again working its way up."
Letting them stay on an exchange is just calling for troubles, too.
Let me know when you answer my question.
"Just as an FYI, I just looked to sell 3.3457 BTC on coinbase. Fee was $121.45, so basically I get 55k for $122 dollar fine. I bought in March at ~1300. 

The thing coinbase does and Im sure other markets do the same is they short the price when you are selling, so currently its ~16000, and when I go to sell its selling at ~15,890, plus the 121.45 fee. 

But i am also not looking to use the BTC for anything other than investment, so it makes no real difference to me when Im up already 1000% since initially getting in. "

(you should have Bitcoin Cash as well).

You should use a reasonably secure (keylogger free) machine for that.

I would try setting up a Monero or Eth wallet first."
Don't worry. If you can stomach the fees, you can withdraw your bitcoin anytime. Really. [Promise.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_6102)
It's not using their token, it's using bitcoin.

Just like tulips
I doubt any nodes will broadcast those anymore.  There is a mintxrealyfee.
Probably a good idea, and that tax hit is why I just converted to other coins and moved them back into a hardware wallet.  Just have to get the rest of my coins out of the exchanges.  Good luck and may everything work out in your favor.
Lol
"I hope we can argue over the arguments and not fall into the trap of name calling and polarization, because I find it more rewarding and interesting to learn from each other. Maybe you can learn me a thing or two. 

Anyway, here is my take on Bitcoin vs Bitcoin Cash with the limited knowledge I've accumulated over the years.

Quite a few think Bitcoin should just be a 'digital gold'. I think this is a mistake because competing cryptocurrencies also act as a store of value. What determines the market cap in the long run is its usefulness, so it has to be a medium of exchange as well. Remember that gold itself is useful as it is used for jewelry and luxury products.
  
Bitcoin have a massive infrastructure lead (hence the market cap), but there is no guarantee that this will last. If Bitcoin continues to lose merchants, business and users that want to use it as cash, this will eventually hurt Bitcoins market position, even if speculators drive up the price in the short term. In the end, speculators are buying Bitcoin in the hopes that someone else will buy if for a higher price.

Now for the arguments over the blocksize. 

I favor the view that more decentralization comes with greater adoption, even if it risks some centralization today. Getting more people into the space will encourage new ideas, use cases and products. Of course, on the way, some people and some businesses will benefit a LOT. But this have always been the case of economic history. On the way at building something great, some people get extremely rich. My view is that we should focus on baking a bigger pie, rather than fighting over how to equally share a small pie. 
  
I view the blocksize debate as a debate over innovation in processing power vs innovation in storage. From my knowledge, Moore's law have been broken in processing power. And please correct me if I’m wrong, but there seems to be a lot of progress and innovation in storage. So for me, it seems like there is more ‘upside’ from innovation in storage than innovation in processing power. If the cost of storage drops and capacity increases significantly, increasing the blocksize seems like a reasonable approach. So even if a cost of a node goes up now, it will become cheaper over time. And with mass adoption there will be established non-profit nodes, for-profit nodes, charity-nodes and so on. This will add to the security of the network. 
 
Further I don't think Bitmain's lead will last. Innovation is happening incredible fast, and the economic incentive to disrupt the mining sector is extremely high. Bitmain may keep their advantage for quite a while, but that's because they, for the time being, offer the most profitable mining hardware.

On a moral level I think it’s much more important that people can afford to use bitcoin, rather than afford to run a node. Most people want to use something that works, and most people are not going to understand (because they don't care) how money works. Ask your mum to run a node or get your friends to explain the monetary system. Not gonna happen.
 
If you could choose between two similar products, but one cost less than a penny to use, while the other cost a dollar or more, then over time people choose the cheapest one. Economics 1-2-3. For the time beeing Bitcoin Cash have this advantage over Bitcoin. Bitcoin Cash also have faster transaction times. However, if Bitcoin decides to increase the blocks or implement lightning network which proves to work great for users, then Bitcoin Cash might fail. My point is, Bitcoin is on a clock and I think we are still somewhat far from successfully implementing second layer solutions like lightning network. Segwit is still far from being used by many on the Bitcoin network even though it got activated this summer.

I think that Bitcoin Cash is not opposed to second layer solution, just that not at the expense of layer one. If it's going to be a global monetary system 1 MB blocks are just not viable.  

For the time being, with the knowledge I have accumulated, I have put most of my money in Bitcoin Cash. I might be completely wrong and lose everything, but that's a risk I’m willing to take. It's exciting times to be alive and I wish both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash the best of luck. "

Executive Order 6102 is a United States presidential executive order signed on April 5, 1933, by President Franklin D. Roosevelt ""forbidding the Hoarding of gold coin, gold bullion, and gold certificates within the continental United States"". The effect of the order, in conjunction with the statute under which it was issued, was to criminalize the possession of monetary gold by any individual, partnership, association or corporation.

You are not using bitcoin with that system. You give that away, and you use their token. From that point you are not in the possession of your own money. It is exactly like a bank.
How long can this go on?
"The inherent risk at this point is just slow to confirm transactions and high fees.  It makes it unusable for purchasing a lot of everyday things.  Though many do claim to get quick confirmations with $1 or lower fees, it does not seem to be the norm.

If there are a lot of transactions with decent fees, I think miners will keep mining what is profitable.  I do not think there is a high risk of a flippening right now.  The new BCH DAA seems to leave the mining in favor of BTC.

BTC could hit $50k or be worth $2k tomorrow.  A lot depends on what you see crypto to be.  An investment or a new transaction space for paying for anything and everything.  For sure, if you had BTC a few months ago, then you have the same in BCH.  One or both will be worth a lot more than both are today, someday.  I still do not know if that is today or 20 years from now.

If you are investing, do not invest more than you can lose.  Despite my very positive outlook, Governments could find ways to make all of your current investments in Crypto go poof.  Or some horrible security flaw could render everyone's coins unsafe.  Or a thousand other possibilities that I cannot imagine.  My point is, you could lose it all.

Good job getting a hardware wallet.  Way to be your own bank.  Good luck, this roller coaster is far, far from over."
"Just a question, if i want to drop the bitcoin.com wallet, how do i go about exporting the private key.
The only thing it let's me do is download a .aes.json file, which isnt really helpful to me."
Its kind of obvious at this point that using BTC as a currency is way to expensive.
Maybe you've been brainwashed too
Lightening Network is just around the corner guys, Bitcoin totally hasn't been taken over by people who do not have Bitcoins best interests for the future in mind. HODL.  /s
What does the post have to do with Bitcoin cash?
I don't understand why payment processors don't just implement all top crypto coins.
"Steam didn't switch because it uses a payment processor.

But your right, BitPay and /u/spair intentionally lost this customer. They should have disabled Bitcoin Payments on their network long ago in favor of alternatives. They didn't and now they're not going to receive fees from this customer. 

Steam not taking bitcoin legacy any more is Blockstream's fault; but Steam not taking **any cryptocurrency whatsoever** is Bitpay's fault. "
Things are only valuable if they are scarce and useful. Bitcoin will not break this fundamental law of economics for long.
Useless Ponzies are not great as a store of value. 
MOE only requires that it can be exchanged for goods.  and, a unit of account it certainly is not, since no one in the world calculates prices in BTC.
"Bitcoin is no longer a ""store of value,"" because it doesn't have a currency value to store. It's now all air -- a giant bubble, running on fools' dreams. Who knows how long that can be kept up...."
Bitpay is paying you back?   This happened to me last week and I got stuck with store credit on NewEgg.   And Bitpay never replied to my service request.
"Screenshots shows 328sat/b and 122sat/WU.

Your wallet failed to do as you asked it. What wallet are you using?"
Just did.
It will, but they wont refund my transaction fees - so how will Bitpay be at a loss, when im the one out $12.93?
Bitpay don't return the full amount - they subtract the fee when they refund.
Im not, im actually trading my bitcoin for good/services.
blockchain.info mis-calculates as well. (yes, I reported it)
Nicholas, i don't think it was anything Newegg did, it was a combination of Bitpay's confirmation system, bitcoins high mempool/fees, and my Ledger Nano S not sending with the correct transaction fee.
What you are describing is a good user experience. It is obvious to anyone paying attention. The lack of acknowledgement cannot be an oversight, and is evidence, IMHO, of sabotage. You might hear some doublespeak drivel about protecting users from unsafe expectations.. blah blah blah. Until proven otherwise, assume companies have been co-opted.
"That's close to the way it works when you fund the Bitpay Visa. I started a transaction on Nov 25 that didn't confirm until Dec 4th (after a miner put it in a block for me). They only require 1 confirmation for that. As soon as you get the 1st confirmation you can start spending the money from the Visa card.

Here are my loads to the card with rough confirmation times.

* 795 bytes fee: 0.00002394 BTC (3 per byte) 8,650.00 exchange rate - fee $0.21 (9+ days, used accelerator)
* 258 bytes fee: 0.00001806 BTC (7 per byte) 6,922.15 exchange rate - fee ~$0.13  (1 hour 48 minutes to confirm)
* 617 bytes fee: 0.00004326 BTC (7 per byte) 5,222.83 exchange rate - fee ~$0.23 (2+ days to confirm, used accelerator)
* 257 bytes fee: 0.00010836 BTC (42 per byte) 4,599.10 exchange rate - fee ~$0.50 (4 hours to confirm)
* 258 bytes fee: 0.00018576 BTC (72 per byte) 4,331.68 exchange rate - fee ~$0.81 (20 minutes to confirm)

I don't know why they do it differently for 3rd party (maybe newegg sets the behavior).

Either way I hate that Bitpay ""refunds"" by tripling your BTC fees. Best case if they refund, you end up

* Paying for the first transaction fee
* Paying for a refund transaction fee
* Paying for a second transaction fee

and that is assuming the second one will go through (othewise it's an endless loop until you run out of BTC)."
"> 0conf transactions

These aren't viable anymore with the artificial fee market created by Blockstream, where transactions with bigger fees consistently push out the lower ones, leaving them in limbo forever."
IMHO if the user requests 500, he/she should get something that includes the discount to make it equivalent to 500, because as you said it's insane to expect the user to know protocol internals.
How come? Can you not figure it out, or something went wrong?  How much did you have?
Bitpay does if it doesn't confirm in a certain amount of time. Newegg uses Bitpay as their bitcoin payment processor.
New Paradigm!
"~~Currency~~ *Store of value* of the future!

What that value is, no one knows!"
You should respond back and ask them to accept ~~Bitcoin Cash~~ Ethereum
"Has Bitpay expressed interest or intent to accept other cryptocurrencies or are they purely staked on Bitcoin Core? Because I smell a business opportunity if not.

God, imagine as a merchant being able to say ""yeah, we accept cryptocurrencies"" and not having to worry about exchange rates, what currency is currently fucked, what's currently the best...Would be the dream."

I know people who've struggled with Ledger not putting enough fees as well. In times of congestion like these always specify a custom fee. 
Yes, I forgot about it.
Also RBF made 0conf way riskier.
Sure, if it can somehow be relied upon to retain value. But btc cannot. 
yup, but it can store a value of zero too
I see we have a BCH maximalist here full of FUD and deluded opinions.
"If user requests 500, he/she should get 500 - regardless of segwit subsidy.

It's insane UI to expect the user to not only know protocol internals, but to have override features that behave in undefined ways."

Yep they still have my coins from the last snapshot...
Didn't know they had a date for the addresses! Dopeee. Is that bitpay thing confirmed?
His ideas sound like garbage.
Yeah true that.  Except IOTA, coz it's a shitshow and they'd lose all the money.
That was the point. OP was being sarcastic when they said to use a tab because it was suggested by homeboy  linked above
The fee is correct, it's just readjusted for Segwit.
Ledger Nano S.
"I know that, but if it wants to be the underlying blockchain behind thousands of dApps and other crypto, it's got to be able to handle a lot more than it currently is capable of. 

Vitalik is very ambitious, and I'm certain he'll succeed. I'm just pissed off that my cat is shit and I can't afford a good cat to breed it with."
Are you also driving to work on a horse-drawn carriage?
The problem isn't that BTC lacks a good user experience.  It lacks an acceptable user experience, indeed **BTC has a dangerous user experience.**
Not only that, the replace by fee is really what makes 0 conf unreliable
Fair point. 
except bitpay doesn't behave that way for their Bitpay Visa see my post at https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7ifgfy/beware_buying_with_bitcoin_right_now_tried_to/dqyhp5q/
[deleted]
Why? Congested blockchain and expensive fees just like Bcore lmao. Also eth is not real money. 
They should accept both.
Not until they fix their scalability problems (fuck cats... I got one, but fuck em anyways xD)
Even though this solves the immediate problem, it isn't good for the long term. Remember the dream was to reach full circle with merchants accepting btc then paying their employees with btc and so on. That dream is shattered as the only sensible option to accept a myriad of crypto currencies is usd settlement. Sad.
Bitpay will be accepting bch once the address format changes to the new unique format on Jan 14th.

"You should contact their support and let them know they failed to create a proper fee as specified.

and thanks for sharing, so others can know what to expect."
I'm from /r/all.  I assumed the whole point was to use it as money (incl pay for stuff).  What can you do with it if you shouldn't use it to pay for stuff?

most fee estimation sites do not include the discount, so including it transparently should be the right UX in this case, still IMHO.

"Shouldn't they be recognizing 0conf transactions as ""payment sent"" and then when 5-6 confirmations are in place, acknowledging  ""payment received""?  There's no reason to not at least recognize that a transaction is attempting to be sent.  There's no added risk in acknowleding 0conf transactions, just dont explicitly act on them as if the coins are safely transferred. "
Fuck everyone still supporting BTC, all these people haven't the slightest clue that a cryptocurrency is actually to be used as a currency and not a speculative bubble for exchanges that you wont even get off the exchanges without horrendous fees.
Why does it say your fee is at 328sat/B
Except that it's 328 sat/B :)
Newegg abandons Bitcoin incoming?
"I wonder how many customers do BitPay want to piss off before accepting Bitcoin Cash, lol.

"I lost on a failed exchange with Shapeshift a while back.  BTC didn't arrive in time, so no BCH.  Fees lost sending BTC to Shapeshift and coming back.

Bitcoin is a store of value, your use case is unsupported.  
I had the same message, but eventually it went through.
I don't understand why they both don't switch to BCH.  Would take all of a few hours probably.  BitPay's entire business is fucked, right?  Are they willing to go out of business just to keep using BTC?
Using BTC as a currency is a missuse..
Bitcoin is great for store of value and unit of account. Not so much for medium of exchange. It's like paying for coffee with gold dust.
I was ready to pay the fee - but not ready to give away my money.
Just use RBF to beef up the fee with a few dollars and you will be golden. Otherwise it will confirm soon anyway.
Why did you need an instant conf?
cyrpto currencies are pretty much useless as currencies.

"Good thing buying things off of newegg was already super easy to do before crypto came along. Use your credit card or paypal. Spend your inflationary fiat. Don't spend your deflationary store of value.

21 million limit, is its only real selling point as 'digital gold'

It has an effective adjustable limit.  Takes a while for it to adjust.  Also it's being worked on constantly, unlike Bitcoin.  And there are solutions already available such as uRaiden.

"I don't. It's 100% centralized, not only the development but also the master node, all transactions go through a centralized entity and tangle can't be made decentralized like they claim it can.

Tangle is a cool concept but can't scale long term. When you start a technical discussion with them you receive as answer ""Reddit isn't the place for technical discussions"". Their announcements that they will work with major companies are mostly fake and from shady sources, no source from the big companies themselves. 

All this screams scam for me. I will never invest in a coin I don't believe in the fundamentals. That's why I'm all in bch, xmr and ada."
Then I will stick to BCH
It's a good thing you're not my friend.
And the main guys behind BCH were both sentenced for financial crimes. Does it make BCH untrustworthy? 
How about its usability, fast transactions and low fees? Almost everywhere where btc is accepted, there is ltc as alternative.

Good option too. But LTC is on almost every exchange i know, so it's very flexible.
im sure that contributes to it as well.

Also the LN whitepaper came out in Jan '16, so add 18 months and thats July of 2017.  We are now testing on Bitcoin Mainnet in December 2017.  Is it really that long of a wait?"
No. You just buy BTC and hold onto it forever. It will make you rich. /s
So this is not the ViaBTC exchange as speculated in another comment?
Up to u. 
Yes, we need to exclude corrupt banks and corrupt companies, aka Bitcoin Segwit.
"BCH is a joke. Transactions are no faster.

I have sent three transactions before with BCH and all three took similar times to BTC to confirm.

BCH supporters and my failed belief in them has lost me a lot of money. Beware the FUD created by this group."
they must be retarded
Unfortunately there's going to be many attacks on this site. 
Wait so exchanges now are NOT banned in China?
Very interesting. Looking forward to this.
https://twitter.com/onchainfx/status/939178178270191616. Check the fees per volume
Does this mean I should buy bitcoin cash? Haha
How do you get the bch to trade with? Buy btc on an exchange then turn it to bch first? 
Too slow. We already got bitfinix. No USD only USDT. /s
"Excellent news.

BCH needs to become another dominant *base* coin if it is truly ever going to flippen BTC. Bringing speed and reliance back to moving coin between exchanges to buy other stuff. 

It seems ViaBTC/CoinEX are definitely strong Cash supporters and will soon be market leaders.

"
"so awesome to see such a massive exchange do this

moooooooooooon"
Barely anyone uses BCH. It’s averaging about 1000 tx/hr compared to BTC’s 400K and ETH’s 730K. 
thats amazing!
That is a pretty huge boost for BCH! 2018 is going to be an interesting year...

"I suggest , in case of a flippening, not to change the ticker in btc.. we will use ""bch"" to teach the newbie how we won this war"
"What I actually dislike is the 'Bullish AF' themes going around with every big news. It's as if it implies we re as much price obsessed as the other subredit. Adoption is great, but 'bullish' to me is too much about price, and too little about usefulness. I want to upvote this, but I can't. 

Kudos to CoinEX tho. I might switch to them"
Epic.
This is one of the main reasons people even have BTC because they have to trade into it.
So it begins
Very good for bch! 
More and more will do this. I wanted to buy some different altcoins on cryptopia yesterday but decided against it because it would have taken me probably a day and 20$ in fees until my bitcoin (core) got there. Go Bitcoin Cash!
ViaBTC just announced as well! WINNING!
Its a survival tactic,less costs = more profit.
Do you think we destroy the Rothschild's banking dynasty by including, or excluding each other?
Dash and Bch fan here. Very excited about this, and hoping the Dash Bch pair is very liquid.
The same people that spend bch to buy coffee 
Bch please
"I think it should be **BCC**, and I like that Binance lists it as BCC. 

Bitconnect doesn't deserve a ticker."
Why can't I say Bcash.... I.... I liked it, sorry /cry
"Im only ""bullish"" if its on all fronts. Positive adoption, strong development, strong community. Price is largely irrelevant to actual use and establishing circular economics which waved goodbye to BTC years ago. 

I'm bullish as hell for BCH."
I second that. First we have to win the war for an independent currency. Then we'll have the path for valuation.
"I see ""bullish"" comments as a personal fundamental assessment.

If more exchanges are using it, it means they are seeing demand for it. Each expanded purpose and use case is part of the fundamental utility, use, and purpose of bch. 

While this means an increase in price, it can mean that the increase is from more useful outlets that lead to more places to buy and spend as an overall increase in adoption and market penetration.

I'm bullish af, but will be a long term hodler. I see a healthy $2k by late 2018. "
Thanks, I totally agree with you. I rather dislike that people who know I've been into Bitcoin since 2013 are asking me if it's worth buying for the price and such. My response: don't. Don't enter BTC, it's a disaster. If you're interested in digital money, get BCH instead.
Agreed, as an amateur coin fan BTC is the one that scares me the most because of how lacking it is and how many people see it as the face of crypto.
"**Bitcoin (BCH)**

H stands for survivng social engineering attack"
Just use LTC for transfer

"i belive lots of exchanges are having problems with withdrawal and transactions because of the generally slowness of BTC.

people complain at butfinex about stuck transactions but its not theyr fault. uts just BTC.

thanks for the info!"
Can u show me the source?
I think that CoinEX (from the article) is actually going to be the name of the ViaBTC BCH exchange.  The OP article and the one you linked both seem to indicate that it's just one BCH exchange owned by ViaBTC management.  STILL SUPER BULLISH!  Going to sign up for an account ASAP.
Didn't someone else post about BCH experiencing blockchain congestation as well.
"I plan to leave a LN channel open with my exchange just for this reason!  Should be a great half step between keeping my trading funds on an exchange and being at risk or keeping them on a ledger and having tx time/fees (6 confirms, so at least 1 hour to transfer). 

Oh snap I actually forgot what sub this was, downvotes incoming!"
You mean crypto is used as a currency?
This.
it was injected so that blockstream can collect fees.  also, it's no longer bitcoin that can scale to global capacity on chain. also, it's patented.
it's all censorship
they could add cash with 30K, not 30M
wait I was told it clears up block space by “segregating” the witnesses outside of the block
(☞ﾟヮﾟ)☞
Good bot
"I've seen the /r/investing subreddit describe buying BTC today as laying a claim to the cryptocurrency space in the hopes of it becoming possible to transact with BTC at some undefined point in the future.

If only they knew what *we* knew about the Bitcoin Core project's repeatedly publicized plans to *never scale Bitcoin on chain*. It looks like the best you can hope for when buying BTC today is you'll be able to buy enough for extremely high mainnet transaction fees not to matter to you.  This or you're hoping to withdraw to a federated banking consortium run sidechain like Rootstock, where I assume deposits and withdrawals will be regulated almost as vigorously as that of Coinbase itself."
You must be thinking of Vulcans
Lessons were learned after Gox, lessons will be learned after BTC.
"Love how everyone wants to talk about BTC who is a fan of BCH, but BCH isn't competing against Bitcoin. It's competing with the hundreds of other alts out there who do ""currency"" and fast, safe, low(no) fee significantly better than BCH can. The reason why they do it is because they know if the discussion is ""why is BCH better than x altcoin as a currency"" there is not a good answer."
"You can be 100% sure - IF the bitcoin bubble explodes in a fashion that everybody here expects - people won't touch anything that has bitcoin in its name with a 10ft pole.

MMMMMAAAYBE. Some other coin in a distant future, like XRP, IOTA, ETH, XMR...but for sure no BCH.

A crash won't end good for BCH either!"
"The only thing slow and hard is the pounding BCH bagholders are taking from Roger and pals.

I’ll keep my BTC, not going to let anyone con me out of it. Good luck suckers"
"Yesterday someone told me I'm dumb and narrow minded for not realizing it would be 

> L2/L3, of lightning, of sidechains, of a combination of the two, of IOTA protocol sidechain running on top of Bitcoin mainchain"
Sorry I meant *wouldn't
How is it a fantasy? Real dollars are behind btc
Sorry I meant *wouldn't

"I just dont get this, the proportion of work required to con people to buy bch wouldnt really be worth it would it?
I mean if someone was going to con someone in crypto there would be easier things to do right?

"
"> I’ll keep my BTC, not going to let anyone con me out of it. Good luck suckers

Says a supporter of the North Coreans. "
"You guys have an obsession with Roger? ;)

Breaking news: Roger Ver is responsible for global warming!!"
Sure, keep your 0.08 BTC and keep fapping to lambo pictures.
It is getting ridiculous..
I love how this someone talks fondly of IOTA even though on the other sub talking about other crypto is a no-no. It's no coincidence. IOTA developers also have giant egos and create a shitty product, and lie every step of the way. Bitcoin and IOTA are a match made in heaven.
"Which are actually possible to be spend on almost anything. 

And also, the dollar don't increase and decrease in value 10 % every day"
And a whole bunch of not-so-real Tethers, although by now they ensured that they spread the contagion.
Market cap is 250 billion. But there is not 250 billion worth of money in Bitcoin. If everybody would sell, there would not be 250 billion dollar to buy. There is a lot less money. That's what I mean with it's a fantasy.
Yep, like ICOs.
Its not a stock kiddo
That's how 99% of people treat it tho 
"You seems to suggest to think BTC is superior **because** it got higher fees.

Can you elaborate?"
"When someone buys 10 BTC at $250,000 worth at $25k per coin.

And then it falls to $9k

Best indicator of future behavior is the past.  Go back and look at the BTC chart."

This is going to end in tears. Many people are going to hate Bitcoin for the rest of their lives...
This is the dangerous thing, it could potentially draw back crypto currencies in general for quite some time. No one will benefit from that except maybe the onese cashing out soon enough.
That's the BlockstreamCoreAXA exit plan. Blow it up so big it won't come back. Taint the name forever.
“Dumb money” is not a new phenomenon, neither in bitcoin nor in general. I think this claim is a huge over exaggeration.
They still won't sell. They have no idea what to do with it. 
Yeah, to the real Bitcoin.
That's cool Vinny, whoever you are.
Lol at Ran fishing asking if he means BCH.
I love it for the technology, this guy is clueless.
Last I heard it was drivechain..
And we have the people that dont buy bitcoin now because they think about technology, and then the devs decide to upgrade bitcoin to 2mb, and youre gonna cry cause at that time bitcoin will be 1 million and you didnt buy it when it was 10k.
"You can be sure of another fact. If that promise gets broken beyond repair, they're for SURE not going to touch anything that has ""bitcoin"" in its name.

Maybe go and change the name to bcash after all? :)"
It’s so true. The amount of anger and disloyalty and lack of fundamental understanding is shocking to me. And frustrating 
"Nice! The Scalator again!

Im really enjoining the SW2X coins that he sponsored...  opps.... "
Tulips ?  #newthing ?
.....Says the guy who sold his bitcoin because he thought that the price was going down??  Vinnys tweets seem to make less and less sense as time goes on.
Isn't he the guy who sold all his coins at $1k a piece? #salty
 I guess because I’ve been transacting with bitcoin on every poker site I use for over 1 year now and have seems its growth within that community since its inception... it has realistic and practical uses online for me I thoroughly think people are being unrealistic to what decentralized means, and the fact that the level of scaling this week is insane. There have been other times wheee it took me 2 days to get my money out of BTC but I forgot about it and didn’t obsess and bitch about how terrible bitcoin was. It was part of the growing pains of something that had far more pros to the cons. 
R/btc is really the melding pot of the retarded Bitcoin idiots. Fake Satoshi, Roger Ver and Vinny Langham are voted up, this says everything about this sub
"> federated banking consortium

Note: That's pretty much what a hub-and-spoke Lightning Network looks like. It looked like that even when they were testing, the mesh people were promised was nowhere to be seen."
I thought their scaling solution was lightning network?
In what scenario we would get to this point?
"> This is going to end in tears. Many people are going to hate Bitcoin for the rest of their lives...

Yeah, they will lose all 80 bucks they have invested in BTC in hopes of being the next Dolan Trump.
"
Hate is impractical. They will be worse off doing so
Jesus Christ, is anyone else annoyed this guy acts like the prophet of cryptocurrency or something? We get it. you're rich. But that doesn't make you the oracle of investments. -.-
"we will. it will give us room to work hard to bring the future of money back on track by proving to people that it works, is fast and cheap and to teach them the basics before they invest again. It will take time and hard work, like everything really valuable.

BTC rise was fast and driven by speculation and fantasy, and it's fall will be just as fast.

BCH rise will be slow and hard, driven by hard work and reality, and that's how it will prevail."
😘... it will be fine ... just hodl your SegWit coins on exchanges. Please, don’t move it, network is bit congested for using it.
"You're thinking like an anarchist.  Bankers have 3,500 years experience lending to mortals.

What is much more likely was a big buy all year while Dimon deried crpto.  Acquire a few billion, then drive the price to $25k and then DUMP.

Taint the name or not, you've made some billions and then you can come back in to the ashes and buy for pennies.

They've been doing it for centuries (millenia)."
