You may study how SegWit works before post bullshit
"There is a natural blocksize in the free market, it won't jump up to 16mb immediately. There is a difference between the max-blocksize and the actual number of transactions in a block (demand).

If we had 16mbs of space for blocks they would probably be about 1.5-2mb which would gradually increase over 10 years.

Further, even if they were full, 10 floppy disks every 10 minutes is very safe even 1 year ago.

Advances like xThin make the network 8x faster at block propagation.

The only improvement Bitcoin needs right now is a blocksize increase, everything else is secondary. You should learn about how Bitcoin works before posting or holding strong opinions."
