Because the banks aren’t constrained by the time preferences and risk tolerances of individuals as they would be in a free market. The central bank guarantees them liquidity in times of crisis so they have zero incentive to hold more than the required reserves (ignoring IOER).

Also, I don’t actually have your ball so don’t try to come take your ball back at the same time as too many other people.
"I'm not a 5 year old, I'm able to use profanities to strenghten my delivery, not to necessarily show I'm upset.

If you gave consent then you gave consent. "
The fuck are you on about then? Are you saying they wrote that line in there after the fact? Are you saying you declined overdrafting, yet it happened? Are you saying you never agreed to getting a visa card from them, yet you did and used it on accident?

Very well put
"Yup the cheap money is nice in other areas. And there's an argument to be made that possibly the analysis comes out that for X in a savings account at y %, vs. A mortgage at B %, you come out net positive savings from the lower mortgage rate. But that would be entirely situational, and I'd like to see some numbers before making a decision.

You are entirely unaware how bonds are issued. They end up on the brokerage, from companies, after an investment bank (which own commercial banks, or are one and the same just different departments) structure/issue bonds for the companies to institutional investors, after which they fizzle down to the secondary market and hit the brokerages. You are entirely incorrect.

Entirely incorrect how? Companies don't issue bonds? We don't have to use bonds as the example if you want to get hung up on who underwrites them and confuse sell with issue, we can use real estate or gold as the investment that you don't need a network like a bank to invest in.
Companies issue bonds and you can buy them from brokerages, the reason companies do that is so they don't have to borrow from banks so I'm not sure what you mean. And while we've had garbage savings account rates we've also had incredibly cheap money everywhere else as well,  3% mortgages and 0% car loans were not something you'd see when you could get a savings account with a decent rate.
"oh i see, would you issue a personal bond? Outside of that, guess who handles bond issuances, to their network of lenders (banks).

And no, never said ""taking money for nothing"" or anything negative, they do what they do, I have access to a quick savings account and that's a-ok. 

However I'm noting that 'free checking' and 'free savings' aren't exactly free, just the cost has been transferred largely to inflationary losses. Because, like I said, savings accounts used to return 3-5% +, but we've been conditioned to 10 years of ZIRP and don't really know any better."

"Eh this isn’t a fee. Sure, my bank only pays me 1.6% in my savings account, but I just keep my emergency fund in there. Any money that I’m expecting to grow is in real investments that generate profit. 

My bank will even pay postage for me if I need to send a physical check through their bill pay service. 

This whole “banks are expensive and charge you for everything” meme isn’t based in reality. Then again it’s crypto we’re talking about, so that’s not surprising."
...people still pay bills with checks?
"""They claim everytime I logged in to the website was consent to any changes that have been made."" If those are the terms of service you agreed to, then you consented. Read that shit.

Yes, I'm sure that is how it feels like if you automatically associate profanities with being upset. But honestly the fact that you can't handle profanities shows a lack of maturity."
"It means that they will not pay you back for more than 250,000. Every single dollar up to $250k is insured. That sounds great to me.
"
"Yes, but banks used to pay 3-5% as a norm, until ZIRP came along. So these days yes, 1.5% seems great, but in reality, anything south of Inf expectations is a fee, bc 1.5% still means inflation depreciation. 

This is in comparison to previously +3% rates on savings accounts. Pre-08, you could keep your e-fund in there like we all do, and still generate decent (comparatively) returns. 

And again, did not say 'banks are expensive and charge you for everything,"" as I said originally, the fee has been abstracted away to inflation and ZIRP. 

Banks aren't expensive, but they still get their's. "
I understand your point, I guess I just don’t understand the outrage. 
That’s probably why they can offer it for free... nobody uses it. :D
I do know that, but I don't like the methods BCH is using to try to get everyone to switch. The tactics are probably typical in the corporate world, but IMO goes against the purported ideology that this is supposed to be a new dawn of equality. Buying the domain for BTC, buying the Twitter handle, and then tweeting that BCH was mined years before BTC? It's just gross. 
Bitcoin Cash is the thing that came first, lol. BTC has gone a different path on purpose.
"Freedom Money/Ecash for the world to use daily. It's all in the whitepaper describing ""Project A"" (Bitcoin). Pretending you don't know this is usually done by intentionally fact-hiding internet trolls."
"The first part is true. However, Bitcoin = BCH now that BTC has been infiltrated and diverted to serve corporate overlords. BCH continues the goals of Bitcoin. 

 This reddit sub was created before BCH. The goal of this subredd was to escape the  r/ Bitcoin censorship and moderator capture that had made that sub intentionally misleading and divisive. The confusion created on this sub (and in many social media discussions) is orchestrated by a team of trolls (and their confused victims) that work for the owners of BTC and r /Bitcoin among other captured media outlets.

"[bitcoin.tax](https://bitcoin.tax) has a cost of 30 USD a year. 

I found a discussion where both services are compared: [https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcointaxes/comments/6ttn5c/bitcointax\_vs\_cointrackerinfo/](https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcointaxes/comments/6ttn5c/bitcointax_vs_cointrackerinfo/)

I think I will give a try to cointracking."
"No worries, here it is:

mailto:B.Kirschbaum@Winheller.com

And I can recommend cointracking.com!"
Thank you! Did you try [https://bitcoin.tax/](https://bitcoin.tax/)? I am between that one and [cointracking.info](https://cointracking.info) 
"Never tried bitcoin.tax..

I just used cointracking and seem to do the job good, so I stick with it.

Maybe look at the price? Cointracking is paid service beyond a certain report size."
I think I pay more for cointracking.. $80 if I remember well,
I think you are both retarded cunts brigading to down vote, go suck a dick in the government.
Downvote? Upvote? LOL. I got better things to do that vote on random posts.
