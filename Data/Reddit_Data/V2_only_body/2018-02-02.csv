So I’m confused what you’re saying... are you saying BCH with 8MB blocks will have as hard of a problem scaling as BTC with 1MB blocks?

It has genuine adoption as a payment system and currency. It's ecosystem is still small but it is growing and it's healthy.  It's also not artificially limited in growth. Bitcoin Core becomes unreliable every time the blocks get full enough. And while Bitcoin Core users are focusing on investing and day trading, Bitcoin Cash users does have a small percentage of users that want to use it as if it where already a currency.

When you guys compare bcash to bitcoin is “bch is way faster and less fees!” But when compared to raiblocks its “more people have it so it’s better!”. When it’s compared against fiat it’s “fiat sucks!”."
Awww awesome billboard dude! You did indeed nail it! 
My objection is to the whole misinformation campaign. Your comment is just a tiny bit of the effort. Pretending the real bitcoin should not be discussed in the real bitcoin sub is just one of many strategies. Pretending not to understand anything that does not agree with your tiny part of the effort is another, lol.

Bitcoin is different because smart contracts were not built on top of it like Ethereum. That *is* a different set of functionality and a different outcome than it could have been.  
"> nor does OP_RETURN have ANYTHING to do with anything here; as no functionality is different because of it.

How so?

EDIT: u/nullc honest question, not trying to trick you, but I think it has everything to do so I'm curious now"
"In practice virtually all of the innovation on top of Ethereum is in the form of non-ETH ICO tokens (competing stores of value).

Given this, there's no use in lamenting the fact BTC can't itself be autonomously escrowed in an event driven way by Counterparty.io, since none of the ICOs built on Ethereum are dependent on receiving ETH for payments: the common business model is you have to acquire the ICO to use the promised/hyped ICO products/services.

The reason Ethereum has so much potential is the ICOs are built on top of ETH, and you must pay fees to Ethereum miners, thus reinforcing the Ethereum ecosystem to the exclusion of the Bitcoin ecosystem.

But a [nulldata version of Ethereum](https://counterparty.io/news/counterparty-recreates-ethereums-smart-contract-platform-on-bitcoin/) built on top of Bitcoin would similarly have this effect on fundamental demand for BTC.

In addition, with a nulldata version of Ethereum built on top of Bitcoin, you could raise BTC directly in an ICO and then investors could store the resulting tokens in industry standard BIP39 Bitcoin wallets, which are [much](https://blog.zeppelin.solutions/on-the-parity-wallet-multisig-hack-405a8c12e8f7), [*much*](https://paritytech.io/security-alert-2/) more foolproof than rolling your own multisig from scratch with a Turing complete smart contract system.

It's interesting you bring up developer coercion considering you yourself have advocated censoring Counterparty.io transactions on Reddit, while Luke-jr has actually done it, not once but [twice](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2pfgjg/exposed_lukejr_plans_on_forcing_blacklists_on_all/)."

(☞ﾟヮﾟ)☞
">The contract was built and had clear intentions of how it was to be executed.

The code is the contract. It was explicitly stated that, in case of conflict between code and description, the code is supreme.

>Hackers went around that and hacked it.

No. The code and network were not compromised. The cause was shitty code. Not hackers.

>I understand that some people believe that that means it should have been allowed, but until humans are absolutely perfect we're gonna have issues like that come up. That's why the judicial system has a focus on intent included in cases. In the case of Ethereum we were able to come together and realize the intent was not for someone to hack the contract and (for all intents and purposes) ""steal"" a sum of ethers held in there. It was the whole community that did this not just Vitalik. Enough agreed that it should be reversed.

These moral arguments are bankrupt from any sort of ethical perspective. You argue that the hard fork was righting a wrong - but that's not why it was forked. It was forked because a large percentage of the miners had economic incentives to fork.

There have been plenty of other contracts where ether has been lost because of shitty code. Gas gets trapped, amounts get stuck forever, etc. The code is clearly not functioning as intended. But because these people don't have 51% mining support, their problems don't get fixed.

It's also really stupid to set this precedent because, in a network of sufficient size, 51% of the miners should not be a party to the same contract. If the ethereum network were larger at the time of the DAO, and there wasn't a majority of miners involved in it, then the DAO wouldn't have forked and everyone would have been SOL. "
">You can still use Ethereum classic then, and bag hold that to the grave.

Networks need people, obviously. It's no good being the only one using Ethereum classic, based on its founding principles. That's why I urge ethereum users to consider those founding principles of ethereum and not violate them.

>Recovering from the DAO hack was important and it showed enterprises for the first time you can effectively ""control + z"" an entire hack. 

No, it didn't. It showed you could ""control z"" ethereum if 51% of the miners are economically incentivized to do it.

There are plenty of other people who have lost ether/gas because of bad code. They don't get a ""control z"". And as the network grows, the likelihood that 51% of miners will be involved in the same contract decreases. Thus, we shouldn't expect this to ever happen again. "
Haha, like clockwork. Greg really is a fucking joke and a terrible human being.. i'm just glad other people are starting to see through his deception and lies. 
Still, there nothing bitcoin cant do now with sidechains and 2nd layers giving all the benefits without risking the baselayer. Id rather have a coin that at its core is rock solid with stuff built around it.
Lemme try too.
"> But a nulldata version of Ethereum built on top of Bitcoin would similarly have this effect on fundamental demand for BTC.

Last time I went on your side I got banned for telling someone that BCH can currently scale to 32mb. Try to beat that. Also, please let me know where people with ''valid'' opinions go now days, because it is certainly not on the other sub. 
Yes.  Yes, I am Greg Maxwell.  We are all Greg Maxwell.
Code is Law has never used by anyone with any credible knowledge of blockchains and development. Intent is a core component of law and Code is Law completely ignores intent of the coder. Mass theft via exploit is akin to someone walking into your house and stealing everything because you forgot to lock the door. It is still theft. The intent of the hacker was theft, meeting the requirement of mens rea.
"And there were pretty large concerns, including that someone with demonstrated malicious intent being in control of such a large amount of ETH could lead to future attacks on the network, especially when proof of stake got implemented.

I'd be pretty surprised if in an alternate reality where Satoshi came back and started using his enormous amounts of BTC to attack the network people just decided to ""well it's okay, code is law, we'll just say goodbye to bitcoin I guess"", after with his enormous stash he stopped the network for months and months on end.

It'd obviously be a ""waste"" of money but if the attacker was having all the addresses constantly blacklisted by exchanges it would just make ""alternative methods"" to get the money out, in this case by shorting, even more viable and likely. Didn't the DAO hacker launch multiple attacks against the Ethereum Classic network, to the point of miners running blacklists? And if the argument is that code is law, then it just brings into question why are widespread blacklists used by miners ""ok"" (which are in a way 51% attacks against the miners that do accept those transactions, to censor valid transactions) but the community agreeing to reverse the hack (by using a version without them) ""not ok"". Haven't been following the ETC network, so I'm not sure where things are now."

Ok, will search. :D
"He is one of the Bitcoin Dictators, believing he owns Bitcoin itself and dictates it's future. When you don't agree with that he will ban you from /r/bitcoin and from https://bitcointalk.org/

He has many alt accounts, but his reign is about to end. He quit blockstream because he does not want to be on the loosing side. He is probably trying to get power in the Bitcoin Cash community using one of his alt accounts. Cobracoin might just be him. As a human being he is okay with lying and deceiving and he has done a lot of damage in the Bitcoin community. Partly because of him it all splintered and we have like 1000+ altcoins now. Together with his blockstream peers he is mainly responsible for that. They tried to grab power but Satoshi said: ""Lol what?""

In fact Satoshi said ""Lol what?"" 2 years before he even heard about Bitcoin. I think my bitcointalk account is only 3 or 4 months younger then his. 

Anyway, we all would like to forget he ever existed. Hopefully within the next couple of years we will collectively be able to forget about him. 

He does not understand what it means to have a truly decentralized system where nobody can grab power unless they secure enough hashpower to kill the system. I think you need like 70 - 85% hash power for that. 51% only allows you to have a bit of a chance to double spend. This does not kill the system. Satoshi build a system that is protected by the greed and the drive for profit. /u/nullc and his peers totally missed out on the good kind of profit so they tried to hijack the whole thing and they failed because they never truly understood the Satoshi idea. And even when people do understand it. Some actually secretly hate it. 

Just remember that no matter what /u/nullc says: it is known by a good chunk of the bitcoin community that this person is a liar and has no integrity or honesty or honor for that matter. I have seen this with my own eyes. Best we forget about him and move forward. "

"> There isn't much of a meaningful difference between 40 and 80 bytes.

Meta protocols store the whole command there, and right now even 80 bytes are not enough. Both Omni and Counterparty currently only have sends with one recipient, which results in a massive number of transactions due to withdrawals from exchanges, because they can't be bundled. We also want to move the recipient into the payload to avoid UTXO bloat due to not-dust-but-uneconomic-outputs, which are currently used to tag recipients. And we also want to add multi-sends to allow bundling of withdrawals and payments in general, but this needs a lot more payload space. Counterparty is going to use P2SH for data embedding in the future.

Vitalik is just a public figure you should just not participate in anything having to do with Ethereum if you don't agree with the hard fork."

No, it was not 80.  There was a proposal that went from 0 to 80 at one point but was changed to 40 before it went out because of concerns about unaddressed dos attacks and abuse, people have incorrectly claimed that some behaviour in the network was restricted or reduced, but that simply isn't the case.

Social Consensus. Ethereum folks come up with the most curious buzzwords.

Just saying..."
I see. Regardless.... what an absolute clusterfuck they have made out of bitcoin. Right with ya there on censorship. When you have to ban hoards of people to silence criticism, you've already lost the battle. 
"> Long after that op_return discussion vitalik was going around with adam back trying to get money for a bitcoin venture, ethereum came after that.

I'm aware of this. I know that Vitalik had spoken to Adam while attempting to raise moneys early on for various projects. And you're timeline is correct. I think that the intentions of the ETH team, given the hidden history, has always been nefarious. After all, just months before releasing the ETH paper, Vitalik was pitching quantum mining machines and asking for money to develop them.

As to why no one has evidence of it, I'm not sure. But either this is a mass delusion, or there is merit to that claim. Whether 40 bytes isn't enough, I think, is irrespective of the point. We know that 40 bytes is fine. The problem with the ETH team is the incompetence that would have failed to figure out how to use the Bitcoin blockchain.

I wouldn't necessarily evoke Rootstock as the grand poobah of 40 byte-stuffing genius though. The EVM is idiotic. And I think there is still a large question as to what distinguishes any of these smart contracts from a timelock enhanced multi-sig transaction. Rootstock is no better than ETH in that sense. Moreover, Rootstock is being developed in a time of sidechains. ETH was too early to have incorporated the sidechain pump into their scam.

> And if it was ""proposed"" as claimed, where is the proposal? Even a gmail DKIM timestamped private email? Nothing seem to be forthcoming. It just looks like a false memory which conveniently (for some) slanders Bitcoin and excuses otherwise transparently greedy and sleazy behaviour.

Again, apart from memory, I'm not going to push the claim. I have nothing more than circumstantial evidence. And I doubt in mass delusion. I would swear that at the very least, both Vitalik and the Counterparty team claimed to have fought the fight. That said, having not been a part of the fight myself, all I have are their early claims, which may be where OP got the idea that the fight happened. Perhaps he heard it there. Given the number of people who have told me the fight occurred, I have been inclined to believe it. But I certainly wouldn't die on that hill."
How is it demised? It's in use every day, there are more transactions on it than ever. I think you have no idea what you're talking about. Moreover, it's current approach would work for ICOs. Why would you want that? These ICOs are scams.
Haha, or maybe just two people who can evaluate the claims of the ICOs and are trying their best to warn people against putting moneys into them.

Why did Garzik et al work to fork the chain with an update and revert the ledger to before the exploiter generated the billions of BTC?

"> never saw email from vbuterin. nor in the relevant pull-request.

That is the strawman. vbuterin didn't have to interact directly with the developers because OP_RETURN was a public discussion after all. No one claimed that the developers directly addressed vbuterin or that vbuterin directly addressed the developers. That is completely beside the fact that this public discussion caused him to develop ethereum on top of primecoin and then later with its own base layer.

Notice that nullc himself said that it wouldn't have made sense for vbuterin to write an email at that time. So why insist on showing a email that wouldn't have made sense at the time? Because there isn't one and that is a easy strawman argument to win. It is however absolutely useless to the discussion. 

Nullc also brought up premine allegations just out of the blue, called ethereum a scam and called vbuterin a liar. Is that a contribution to the discussion? Is that on topic? If you think it is then please read the ""Please don't"" section of the reddiquette again which you conveniently posted above.

> it's the statistical points value of nullc's comments where you see the obvious tendency of this sub to downvote to ""shut him up"" just because they disagree.

That is only one interpretation of his statistical points. One other interpretation is that he is consistently posting strawman arguments, lies, and other such comments that generally don't contribute to the discussion in a positive way. Having read a lot of his comments in this subreddit over the years, I find this explanation far more likely than what you accuse us of doing.

Fair enough.

> I wouldn't necessarily evoke Rootstock as the grand poobah of 40 byte-stuffing genius though. The EVM is idiotic.

Full agreement, I wasn't holding it out as a good idea. Just pointing out that there wasn't anything blocking whatever eth people wanted to do in Bitcoin that required the route they took. It would have been hopelessly foolish any way it went-- I just think it's unfortunate to see eth's issuers attempt to use Bitcoin as a justification for their actions without it being contested. :)

> told me the fight occurred

Fight? no way; perhaps someone was thinking about it and not making it clear-- always possible.  Certainly in the Bitcoin project we never saw anything like someone saying ""we want to make a smart contract uberscam, and need more bytes here because bar!"" (if we had, we would have at least told them why they didn't need more bytes!). But as you say-- it was nefarious from the start, who knows what crazy justifications they were circulating among themselves and their earliest investors.  ""Quantum simulation based mining"" set an awfully low bar for credibility, since that is basically 'Nigerian prince as a filter'-grade low credibility.

"Relatively speaking, Counterparty isn't *as dead* as a coin like Emunie. It ostensibly has users. Which is commendable.

But Counterparty has no full-time developers whatsoever, and the thing is written in shittastic Python which is bitrotting. It's a small miracle it sees any use/speculation at all. In the scheme of things, I'd put it slightly above Dogecoin give or take in terms of ""deadness"", but only slightly.

> Moreover, it's current approach would work for ICOs. Why would you want that? These ICOs are scams.

I try to be more careful with the term ""scam"" because I don't want it to lose all meaning, e.g. OneCoin and Bitconnect are proper scams. ICOs are a force to be reckoned with, and certainly scammy, but they ultimately won't go away without getting meaningful competition which addresses project funding without ICOs. Which is to say, the idea of raising OPM has merit in and of itself, and ICOs accomplish the shit out of this."

"> proposed building ETH on Bitcoin. That was an early claim, and was made during the time that the size of OP_Return was being debated. Regarding the evidence, I'm not sure I have it other than as a memory.

Long after that op_return discussion vitalik was going around with adam back trying to get money for a bitcoin venture, ethereum came after that. So I think your memory is obviously incorrect. Perhaps you recall ""op_return"" being discussed later, long after then?  In any case, it's also the simplest explanation as to why no one has any evidence of it.  It also just doesn't make sense:  what's the technical argument for anything that could be done with 80 bytes that couldn't be done with 40?

"Perhaps if Counterparty had done an ICO and completely sold out to unprincipled speculators, we would've been better off due to having the ability to hire a bunch of developers and a full-time team of aggressive marketers to hype it. But then the Counterparty system as it's known today wouldn't exist or be interesting. Paradoxically this (lack of fundraising) also led to the system's effective demise.

> Ethereum is a giant problem

1. In Vitalik's own words, his original plan was to launch Ethereum as a metacoin on top of Primecoin entirely due to the usual suspects being aggressively anti-metacoin. So it definitely can be done if the demand exists for it, which [arguably](https://coinmarketcap.com) it does.
2. I don't necessarily disagree; I think Counterparty's original approach of hard coding pluggable features would work perfectly well for ICO tech, although it'd probably need to be built over again from scratch in a decent programming language."

"> Would? you and your scammer buddies built that in XCP and ... it's a total bust. No one wants it. And no one stopped you from doing it, as stupid and scammy as it is.

Counterparty.io never raised a dime in funding, and Adam Krellenstein was bought out by Symbiont before he could prepare the Ethereum port for mainnet launch, sad to say. This is the problem with projects which lack a self-funding mechanism: private interests step in and often derail the system. This is an oft cited reason for the existence of the Blockstream company, and I've directly attributed Blockstream's actions wrt Counterparty to the [rise of ETH to 90% of Bitcoin's market cap](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/6wxueo/your_best_pitch_for_decred/dmcer4d/).

In practice, we are now having to turn to creative sources of funding; but *do* let us know if we should reach out to the Blockstream company for a stipend.

And I don't agree with the approach of having a bespoke VM, Ethereum-style. Whatever happened to hard coding pluggable features + the pull request button on GitHub? You can just build a Counterparty-like system using a decent programming language and then keep extending the core of the system through Decred-style HF voting. It should work fine assuming the developers of the underlying system aren't actively attempting to destroy you."
Very cool
More like, who accepts Bitcoin for champagne?

"Indeed. I expect the precedent to be fully supported by the ETH developers and community in all such future cases in the interests of morality.

Edit: Please cite the bug reported."
"Let me phrase it another way for you. When the individuals contributed to the DAO smart contract, were they implicitly granting an attacker the ability to withdraw those funds via exploit or was that part of the understanding? Further when the contract was coded, did the developers’ intent include allowing an external party to leverage an unknown vulnerability to extract millions of dollars worth of tokens.

The answer to both of this is a resounding no.

The hacker had a guilty mind, hence the choice to remain anonymous and to try to extract the ether to exchanges with questionable if any kyc quickly."

"You don't know your history. Krellenstein didn't get bought out before the EVM was released. The EVM was developed while he was with CP and after he was gone. It was decidedly ill-advised and abandoned. u/nullc, however, is mistaken with regard to Vitalik's claim that he proposed building ETH on Bitcoin. That was an early claim, and was made during the time that the size of OP_Return was being debated. Regarding the evidence, I'm not sure I have it other than as a memory.

As to whether Ethereum would have been advisable to build on top of Bitcoin is another story. Ethereum is a giant problem, and I worry about even the viability of second layer protocols like Counterparty considering they mess with the economics of the blockchain. I can't imagine what a disaster the EVM would have been had it been released.

I can't really take anyone lamenting the loss of ""ICO tech"" in Bitcoin. ICOs are scams, all of them. And if you don't understand that, you're probably actively giving away your money."
">And I don't agree with the approach of having a bespoke VM, Ethereum-style. Whatever happened to hard coding pluggable features + the pull request button on GitHub? You can just build a Counterparty-like system using a decent programming language and then keep extending the core of the system through Decred-style HF voting.

Doesn't scale and involves politics. There's no way cryptokitties would ever get added as a hard fork. "

I agree it's sad that people won't get to see nullc's comment regardless of how you define censorship and whether downvoting is part of it.
"> the other sub has strict rules about altcoin discussions

They banned me because I said something the mods don't like. They didn't provide a reason and upon asking for a reason they muted me from the modmail for 72h. This ban was made only minutes after BashCo replied to one of my comments he disagreed with. First with a (automod-) ShadowBan and then with a complete ban.

They don't give a shit about the rules. You disagree, you are gone.

This isn't about ""altcoins"" or whatever. They allow altcoin discussion every day as long as it is in the form of ""btrash btrash roger ver scam"" and when someone replies to the threads and comments bashing bch with something positive then they are gone. Not to mention that IF something happens to evade the censorship somehow then it will be downvoted there even worse then here. 

Comparing that to the situation here is ridiculous. Yes, you might get some downvotes if you say something stupid or off topic, but that is from the community and it does not prevent anyone from reading it either. Also since voting is done by the community you can also upvote stuff if you think that this is a comment that contributes to the discussion.

A Community down voting things that do not contribute to the discussion is not censorship.

A Moderator deleting comments/posts and banning people because he does not like what they say even though it was on topic is absolutely censorship. "
well good for you.

"What's especially frustrating is many of /u/nullc's criticisms ring true: Ethereum *was* heavily premined, and the aggressive sales tactics employed by the Ethereum founders were *definitely* highly suspect, and have remained so to this very day.

It's just it didn't have to end with Ethereum hitting 90% of BTC's market cap. Those of us who have been in Counterparty since the early days tried EVERYTHING to convince the Bitcoin Core developers of the dire necessity of implementing smart contract features on Bitcoin mainnet, but we were ignored and belittled for our beliefs. I've [documented](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/6wxueo/your_best_pitch_for_decred/dmcer4d/) this unflattering history of the Bitcoin system elsewhere.

Metacoin systems can trivially [implement the Ethereum VM in full on top of Bitcoin](https://counterparty.io/news/counterparty-recreates-ethereums-smart-contract-platform-on-bitcoin/), if this is even desireable, which is still arguable IMO.

Combine the above with something like [Aviv Zohar's SPECTRE](https://medium.com/@avivzohar/the-spectre-protocol-7dbbebb707b5) for 10s block times and Bitcoin could quickly reach feature parity with Ethereum.

If Counterparty and Blockstream's roles were reversed in 2014, and we could've steered the Bitcoin ship, Bitcoin would've implemented Ethereum on mainnet before Ethereum itself was even able to *launch*. A move which would've likely spared Bitcoin from incalculable brand damage and brain drain.

Greg Maxwell and the usual suspects of Bitcoin-land are [directly to blame](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/6wxueo/your_best_pitch_for_decred/dmcer4d/) for Bitcoin dropping the ball on smart contracts. They're now busy backpedaling desperately and implementing their own Simplicity VM *four years too late*. And might I add: it's mildly amazing to consider the sheer *mental gymnastics* required for the usual suspects to justify implementing Simplicity on Bitcoin mainnet given the YEARS they spent lambasting Counterparty over ""blockchain bloat""."
"Yeah I think this is why Nakamoto stayed anonymous. This kind of reaction can't be productive to a community trying to jointly manage an open source project.

I mean, what if u/nullc were Satoshi Nakamoto and behaved like Buterin? Everyone is hating on u/nullc in here (and I agree) but if he wielded the kind of ""founder power"" that Buterin wields he would be able to single handedly push Bitcoin in a shitty direction (even more than he already is). "

Yes. I read your previous post on this, and you nailed it. I was working on colored coin systems at the time, and Bitcoin core was frankly malicious in it's commentary and made every effort to control, limit, and otherwise destroy every possible system built on top of Bitcoin. Ethereum's market dominance is a direct result of complete idiocy. Many people including myself actively campaigned for even small concessions so that we could expand Bitcoin's capabilities, but were shut down every single time. You don't have to look very far to find the culprits, the veritable cancer that is Bitcoin core.

But Ethereum is not necessarily trying to be currency like Bitcoin Cash is. So why is it a scam? It will need a very long time to mature, maybe 20+ years or longer. But I see real usage and utility for Ethereum. Maybe smart contracts will be build on top of Bitcoin Cash one day. But is it not good to have a couple of separate systems and networks? Not 1000+ copy cat crypto's but a couple of separate blockchain type networks, I think that is good. I mean maybe Ethereum has nothing to offer long term but the same can be said about Bitcoin Cash. We will just have to wait and see. 10 years is way to short to be able to look at crypto from a distance and give it a fair judgment.

That's really exciting! Where can I learn more about the hardfork schedule or planned upgrades? I always liked Monero's planned hardforks and didn't realize BCH did the same thing.
meh, I kinda like the idea of having both ethereum and bch. Eth can run all the apps and do the computing and what not, and it keeps our blocks free to be THE world money. 
I can honestly see projects like EOS being the future too. I've been following it for awhile, can't wait for June.
#Doody Head Greg
Eth and neo have a great chance though.
Core developers (Greg was one of the most vocals, I remember) were making it clear they would try to prevent any use of the block chain that deviated away from pure monetary transaction. They were trying to forbid people to use Bitcoin's block chain to store data, something essential to Ethereum.
It was 100% possible to build ethereum on top of btc. But politicking amongst btc made him go his own way.

"Bitcoin is Satoshi's primitive proof of concept that will go nowhere.

Ethereum and Smart Contracts are the future.

Bcash is still a scamcoin built to allow ASIC-Boost mining which was incompatible with SegWit (which most Bitcoin users STILL haven't adopted anyway despite full implementation, which is why Bitcoin is dedcoin, LN will see the same fate).

https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1347.msg23049#msg23049"
unless XCP / Mastercoin can work on Layers like LN, the idea won't work. Blockchain is bloated, decentralization would have been lessen if bitcoin went bcash route. Meth is no better, my geth fullnode needs baby sitting while bitcoin full node is chugging along. In the long run Simplicity / Rootstock / 2 way pegged sidechain smart contract will replace Meth entirely. Yes I was one of those Mastercoin/XCP burners. I profited shiton from them, but that's about it. The idea are misconceived. 
Brand damage?  BCH worried about brand damage?  The whole loss of confidence compounded when all the FUD started that BCH might be the new bitcoin.  People saw 2 btc's on coinbase and one already having over 3k value so naturally they question what the heck makes any of them special if they can so easily be copied.  When a coin is branded and pushed for offering something unique it's one thing, but to try and denounce the coin at the top with near 20k in value at the time, did you not consider the loss of confidence and questioning of crypto in general that would create?  When a coin can go up so high and then be considered the fake by news media and where ever else you pushed your agenda?  Enjoy your just reward BCH.  Well deserved!  
"> tried EVERYTHING to convince the Bitcoin Core developers ...  but we were ignored and belittled for our beliefs

Link to even one mailing list post you made advocating this. ... no such thing exists, because XCP has always been about pumping an altcoin in order to rip off and exploit the gullible.

LOL what?

"> mildly amazing

This has been heavily debunked already. Actually inflation rate is lower then Ethereum. Total supply cap only starts to make a difference after a couple of ten years I think. There is some post floating around somewhere that addresses this. 
Doesn't it have a second utility as a currency? Almost all tokens are issued on it.
"In 2012-2013 I and Vitalik built a decentralized exchange on top of Bitcoin. We built an initial prototype in matter of month.

Getting it to production quality turned to be difficult because of hostility from the protocol level. First of all, Gavin Andresen introduced dust threshold which made simple and elegant protocol impossible. 

Then we faced some form of hostility from Bitcoin developers (including you, IIRC) so it became apparent that basing a decentralized exchange on Bitcoin is a risky bet as it won't be officially supported in any way, and in fact a protocol might be broken at any time.

So Vitalik definitely ""attempted any such thing"". Of course, colored coins isn't Ethereum, but currently Ethereum is used mostly as a decentralized exchange, so functionally it's the same.

He also tried implemeting a smart contract later for Mastercoin which is quite close to Ethereum. So while there was no project called Ethereum, he made attempts to extend Bitcoin to implement decentralized exchange and smart contracts."

IMO they really were just Gentoo-loving C++ programmers who were trying to keep their full nodes runnable on home desktop computers using backwater internet connections. Anything which was conceivably a threat to this was is in their minds an existential risk to the Bitcoin system, and so they resisted it by hook or by crook."

Decentralization is a joke for BTC, a few guys using soft fork to attack the whole network with segwit that no one wants, and it succeeds. You have to admit that all the cryptocurrency are centralized around its lead devs, so it is a competition of lead devs, nothing else
BCH is the bitcoin, BTC is the one stole the brand (it is segwit coin in fact), you have to admit the truth eventually, because there is only one truth
I actually have an email from Vitalik explaining to my boss why he stopped working on the old project. Should probably do something with that.
"> LOL what?

Unbelievable .... /u/nullc, you and your blockstream buddies went:

Bitcoin is OURS! And OURS alone

But Satoshi said: ""LOL what?""

"> Link to even one mailing list post you made advocating this. ... no such thing exists, because XCP has always been about pumping an altcoin in order to rip off and exploit the gullible.

You're cherry-picking, having been intimately involved in the discussions around metacoins on public forums like Reddit and Bitcointalk since 2014.

You were the primary source of fallacious accusations of ""DoS vectors"" opened up by OP_RETURN, and your (former) company, *Blockstream*, had a direct stake in competing against our approach.

Counterparty-like systems are Bitcoin's only actionable defense against Ethereum, and have been since 2014, pre-dating Ethereum itself. You're the one who is blind for honing in on the existence of XCP: what's one more token amongst thousands of ICOs, when it's the ICOs which are stealing Bitcoin's thunder, practically none of which integrate ETH payments? Can't you see Ethereum is valuable because of what is built ON TOP of it?

With the help of [Counterparty](https://counterparty.io/news/counterparty-recreates-ethereums-smart-contract-platform-on-bitcoin/), Bitcoin had the *market lead* on ICO tech, per se. But we just couldn't convince you to look past XCP... and now Ethereum is hitting 60-80% of Bitcoin's market cap once again. At what point will the Bitcoin investing public begin to realize you fucked investors?"
Are you here just to prove that you're a dick you can't admit failure, because that's how you come off, childish.

"The project is essentially ""dead"", but coins never die. They just run out of developers and funding. But this doesn't mean the ideology is dead, far from it.

Importantly, I've advocated [Counterparty Cash](https://www.reddit.com/r/counterparty_xcp/comments/7scmtw/counterparty_cash_should_be_more_strategic_with/) airdrop its proposed XCPC token to Bitcoin Cash miners over the course of many years. I'd rather see Bitmain and Roger Ver step in and develop the system on top of Bitcoin Cash of their own accord after the financial incentives are in place this way rather than doing an ICO or another proof of burn.

A similar idea was [originally proposed by Adam Krellenstein](https://github.com/CounterpartyXCP/counterparty-lib/issues/428) on top of Bitcoin Core."

"can ETH handle all the dapps (i think thats what these are called)  the world has to offer? im certain BCH could when we keep scaling the shit out of it...
also why not let BCH eat some of that world money?"
But ethereum isn't just decentralized computing, it's also a currency. If ethereum solves the scaling problem, there's nothing stopping it from being the main currency

"Judging by this thread, it seems Ethereum is finally starting to bother some people. They were focusing all their attack campaigns on BCH and ""forgot"" ETH who's now more than 2/3 of BTC in total valuation.

And we can already see in this thread some of the BS that will be used in their soon to start smear campaign against ETH."
There were coins reserved for developers, no? At least in the whitepaper. This is functionally equivalent to premine for non-mined coins. (Not to mention that many people equate crowdsale to premine.)

"I disagree about Buterin's integrity. He supported the DAO hard fork. 

The DAO hard fork directly contradicted the purpose and principles of ethereum. They forked ethereum, when ethereum worked as intended, for the benefit of one party to a smart contract.

From ethereum's webpage:

>Ethereum is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts: applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third-party interference.

Hard forking the DAO was clearly third party interference in a private contract. The network forked on behalf of some parties to that contract. Bitcoin forks for the benefit of the network. 

Further, the terms of the DAO explicitly stated that the code was the Supreme contract, **not** any written explanations. In the event of a conflict between written representations and the code, the code is supreme. Guess not. 

"
"Yes Buterin totally embodies the spirit of Satoshi Nakamoto, who didn't really believe in the necessity of 'proof-of-work'. Satoshi would have loved Buterin's plan to migrate ETH to a proof-of-stake system that ultimately comes down to ""social consensus""."
[deleted]
"""this is what the kids call 'getting rekt'"""
"and who is using it? the plan for it was to do everything ETH smart contracts do, but better.. the contracts are ieven interchangeable afaik. why is nobody using it? it makes no sense for people running contracts on ETH to not move to RSK on BTC, those are more secure and decentralized, right? ;) because no one will leave ETH for slow and expensive BTC. we have a product that already works. with widespread adoption. why should all those people move to RSK now? the fact that some cotracts have bugs is not a protocol issue, but specific contract dev issue."
To think: all that value of Ethereum was pushed off onto another platform when it could have been kept on Bitcoin. Blockstream devs are good at pushing away value and use-cases, to the detriment of Bitcoin.
It objectively will not happen. I'm a fan of it, don't get me wrong, but to think that BCH will ever pass BTC is incredibly naïve, only way it'll happen is if BTC makes their coin even worse (which admittedly is tough to do), they just already have so much support the only thing that can topple it is BTC itself.

This would have been so awesome though, imagine bitcoin with the features of eth, neo, zcash, and everything else added to it, just a single crypto that did everything.
No worries guess, counterparty and OP codes are returning in Bitcoin Cash. Let's ignore core and let's improve BCH with adoption and utilities!

"Article didn’t age well. :)

3-10 Sat fee transactions are confirming on Bitcoin and LN on mainnet growing like crazy. Shnorr, Mast and LN make alts ‘irrelevant’ in the coming years. 

Not to mention the MIT research paper that allows Bitcoin signatures go do down 90% in size allowing bitcoin to process 20-25x as many transactions together with segwit, Shnorr and batching, once it gets deployed. 

LN will incentivize more Bitcoin full nodes because now holding bitcoin and running a full node pays. This will allow us to hard fork to a larger blocksize without the risk of losing decentralization, as planned by Core years ago. Read the official scaling plan on bitcoin.org that includes a variable blocksize for BTC.

Put on top of this the likely event of a Bitcoin ETF and a few other major events and the outcome of the next few years could be the exact opposite of what the article hopes for. "

Among other reasons,

* 75% premined misleadingly advertised by its issuers as 12% premined because they decided to not count the premine they sold (including 'sold' to insiders) as pre-mined.

* A perpetually inflationary monetary policy constructively advertised as not inflationary via misleading total supply graphs in their prospectus.

* ""Unstoppable smart contracts"" immediately stopped and reversed if and only if the issuers personally lost money due to their own ill advised investments in them...

* Claiming their involvement isn't motivated by profit interests while even the publicly disclosed amount of the unspent premine given to a single developer is on the order of a half billion dollars now (I'm not complaining about the windfall, but the dishonest presentation of continuing to hold it as not profit motivated).

... and that's without even getting into all the details on the untruthful ""world computer"" and ""replace facebook"" pumping by paid placement speakers at conferences and meetups before it was launched...

To be fair bcash is a fork of the original Bitcoin.. so? 
"> Are you arguing SegWit was not a 'thing' that gave rise to an 'action' (the creation of the Bitcoin Cash fork).
> Or are you using your own definition of 'cause' ?

I hope you don't make other decisions based on this flawed kind of thinking. 

Please consider: if you argue that Segwit was causing the Bitcoin Cash fork you would need to argue as well that the pregnancy of your mother was caused by your grand grand grandmom. And that some cosmic incident was causing the creation of the Earth and thus the creation of Bitcoin.
"
"Yes, taken to extreme I would make those arguments.

You don't appear to acknowledge that events can have multiple causes. Your examples are obscure, but the 'big bang' is of course a cause for everything else which has followed it.

The development of SegWit is however a fairly significant cause for the creation of BCH - the UAHF announcement which later became BCH clearly refers to SegWith as a key reasoning - https://blog.bitmain.com/en/uahf-contingency-plan-uasf-bip148/"

Clarified so I don't get brigaded.  Unless I'm getting downvoted for disparaging your god emperor and if that's the case then I totally understand why so many cryptothreads are filled with well... garbage.  "
So how come all this happened right after obama left? In 8 years none of this was happening.... Why did the stock market explode right as trump was elected? Why are all these companies coming to the US? 
"I agree with you, I got downvoted pretty heavily when I made this argument in a separate thread a while back. Basically boiled down to ""well Hillary had CTR shills and r/bitcoin has shill, totally the same!"" No there is so much more under the surface, it's like someone else who responded to me earlier today, ""Trump = Lower Taxes, Sanders = Higher Taxes, *Simple*. "" **BCH Please**, there is so much more thinking that should happen before you decide to follow a person or belief. I feel often that I'm in the minority in this thinking though. Skepticism across America is being actively attacked by religion, mainstream media and the education system."
"Nah now they *can't* say ""Thanks Obama"""
You are absolutely and utterly delusional. So I guess coincidentally, all these changes take effect once Trump becomes president, but never happened under Obama? LOLOL the denial is incredible.
Look at the facts ma dude. Everything trump is doing is boosting our economy. 
"He didn't. If you honestly think his one year in office could actually have a fundamental effect on the country and the world that quickly, then you don't have a grasp of the fundamentals of economics.  

Which deals has he renegotiated? Post a few of them. Give me actual facts instead of your opinion. I'm open to hear them.

Why are you so obsessed with coal? It's a dying industry and it's bad for the environment.  The nation employs more people in solar than coal... Why don't we start a shift to the healthier alternative.  Worrying about coal mining jobs is like worrying about cancer doctors if we find a cure...should we not find a cure?

And what happened to draining the swamp™?

If anything the corruption is just more blatant now. I can't tell if it's because people don't care anymore, or if they're actually still falling for it like you...

And full disclosure before you call me a shill or biased libtard myself: I voted for the guy. I wanted to give him a chance and he just hasn't impressed me so far.  "

Try to read outside your bubble sometimes. I try to read a lot of sources, even when it makes me uncomfortable, because then at least you know your thinking is being challenged. Don't take the easy way out."
">colluding with Russia, the enemy of America for the last 70 years, isn’t even illegal lol

When you have to make this argument you are on the wrong side. Putin is playing your party like a fiddle. "
Prototypes of the wall have already been built and the wall is definitely happening. He also can't throw Hillary in prison the very moment he becomes president or else he will be smeared by the media forever and will look like he's trying to silence the opposition.
"Dude, it's a joke. Lighten up.

The only risk in wearing this hat is that some insane, foaming-at-the-mouth leftist authoritarian might want to pepper spray you for no reason.

Otherwise, you're good."
That's good to hear. Though whatever your beliefs I'm sure you've got your personal reasons. But your leanings have only made me more curious what stereotypes you feel a red hat with a tongue in cheek embroidery is implying?
"Who cares what the opposition thinks?

I'm no Trump fan, but BCH isn't going to grow because we please a whole bunch of economic ignoramuses who think that Bernie Sanders is neat, and don't have a sustainable free market source of income.

BCH isn't going to grow because we bend over backwards to please politically-obsessed, anti-free-speech crusaders.

Bitcoin is supposed to be an alternative to that.

This hat makes fun of politics. If someone is so obsessed with partisan politics that it ""triggers"" them, then they are not the target market for early Bitcoin adoption.

Bitcoin Cash is not just apolitical, it's *anti*-political. This hat makes fun of politics. It's cute. People who don't get it are dumb."
"That makes it even funnier. 

In that case, it's self parody and parody of r/bitcoin in addition to being political parody.

All of a sudden, it works in three different levels for me instead of just one.

Joke just got funnier!
"
[deleted]
By that logic, whatever happened during Obama's first few years should be attributed to Bush right?
"Yeah, but what's the idea? Why do we parody that? 

Maybe I'm a bit slow today. "
You seem upset. 
It won't work as well in our case, because we already have a massive social media campaign aimed at characterizing us as stereotypical Trump supporters.
"Based on a recent thread in the other sub, a whole LOT of BTC supporters are Sanders supporters. 

As bad as Trump is (and he's pretty bad, what politician isn't?), socialism is a whole lot worse.

The whole point of Bitcoin is that it stops people like Trump and Sanders from being able to take, redistribute or devalue your money.

Still a fun and funny hat though, even for a non-Trump-fan like me."
Trump supporters on the Internet are libertarians (from US and outside) which sided with him mainly cos he's against PC
I thought this meme died in 2017
That's just a narrative that doesn't match reality. He is the least actionable president we have ever had, he's passed less laws and bills than any president, and Obama left office with a 50% campaign promise rate and a 25% compromised promise rate. Trump is at a 15% campaign promise rate currently (less than your 1/5th). Stop spreading fake news.
Obama was pretty effective at staying focused.  I didn't agree with all of his policies or decisions and he flaked on a few goals but....  not like the cheetoh.  
It's easier to follow up on promises when your party controls the government. 
"If someone promises to shoot me in the face I wouldn't applaud them for upholding it.

Either way, it looks like he has broken just as many: http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/trumpometer/"
They may have said that because it was obvious he was going to be a Republican donor puppet and the telecom donors wanted NN repeal. Just like with the donor relief bill, he'll do whatever they ask him. 
I'll take your word on that.  I doubt Trump knew/cared but I can believe someone in his camp would consider that an issue to mention.  Especially to drum up Telecom donations.  In regards to the last line...  I mean we all can shill, look where we're posting lol.  
"Tell me anything he's really done to reach out to citizens who didn't vote for him in 2016? Do you think he's had black women and Independents with Post Grad degrees move across the aisle?  So far we've seen sweeping changes in VA and Alabama of all places go blue in the Senate! 

Don't get me wrong the Democrats are a mess themselves, but I can't see how Trump has moved that 46% of the popular vote up since election day."
"thanks obama
"
"It's not a ""resemblance"". It's *parody*."
"Yes those are good things, but it's intellectually irresponsible for anyone to attribute it solely to his administration.  You are being fed cherry picked numbers.  

For instance: yes black unemployment is at historic lows which is great but if we unpack that a little bit (it's gone down ~1% in the last year, while it decreased ~ 8% in the five years prior) so if you're going to lavish so much praise on Trump, you have to give Obama even more credit for the same metrics..."
"I think the situation has reversed a lot in the last 2 years. 

And yes, it can be exhausting, I think most people are experiencing that. "
I do not lose all credibility using the word “libtards” that is my opinion, I use the word libtards because you’re honestly retarded if you do not approve of what trumps doing and would rather of had Bernie or another Clinton in office. I don’t just watch the news for my sources that is ridiculous. These are facts. Trump forcing companies to move to US, pushing illegals out, keeping coal mining jobs here instead of overseas, he is focused on the building up our infrastructure which will create more jobs and renegotiating our trade deals which saves us money and creates jobs which all lead towards a booming economy. If you are honestly worried about what he’s doing you need to stop watching CNN and re check your sources these are facts. So trump had a major impact on the US economy rn not just the stock market the whole economy in itself.
It is quite obvious that he is no puppet of the Russians. He bombed Assad, refused to lift the sanctions against Russian politicians and allowed selling guns to Ukraine. His position towards Russia is harder than Obama's
It is not even illegal to collude with any countries lol where is the law? I don’t believe trump did or their would be proof, but reguardless where does it say collusion is illegal?
"""all his promises"" is too far fetched though. The wall is nowhere to be seen and he definitely didn't drain the swamp let alone put Hillary in jail"
**If I were**
Assuming you think Bitcoin Cash is not a scam and perhaps even legitimately Bitcoin, it's us.
"I might if I was among friends, but I'm not publicly comparing myself to a populist political supporter and in particular not to what the world knows as a ""typical Trump supporter""."
"Almost the complete opposite of all you said. 

Technically, I'm a center-libertarian. (highly influenced by Ayn Rands objectivism, but anarcho-capitalist)"
"No, the point is that our _opposition_ and the _majority of people_ won't get the joke. 

Inside jokes can be fun, but they don't help public perception."
Yeah fruitsofknowledge,  you're not smart enough for these cool kids
You just brought up the economy 5 times, which is Obama’s accomplishment, not trump’s.
No you just don't get it. So far we have been having arguments with Bitcoin Core supporters comparing the coins mostly on their merits. That has gotten rather boring, and winning that way is just too easy. It will become much more interesting and challenging around here when every debate with a Core supporter begins with a long exchange attempting to establish that we are not all rightwing Trump supporters. Maybe we won't even get to the boring stuff. I for one am looking forward to it. Just like back in #GamerGate. Those were the days...
lol... says the one that unsubbed over a hat picture because anything remotely related to Trump triggers you?
"yah.. everyone outside US thinks US politicians are pretty bad.... we have ""some"" good in EU but only a very very small number...."
"That's actually a very good point. I still tie these types of hard back to Samson and Lopp.

Though I hope people involved in Bitcoin cash would choose to do their own thing. I can't get mad at people having a little fun. It doesn't all have to be graphs and gains. Little ribbing and friendly competition in the dominance hierarchy is healthy."
This 100x, if this is just a one off joke hat, let's not make it a ongoing brand idea.
"""World's population in general"" is a bit of a stretch.

I don't like Trump (he's a protectionist and an annoying person) but dude--you've got to get out of the bubble."

I think your personal biases are causing you to see that backwards. 
Great to see you follow: feelings>facts.
One pile of shit at a time.
"If you think a year is enough time to cause economic growth, you need to take some econ classes. 

This is an extreme example, but the Great Depression recovery took over a decade: 
> In the U.S., recovery began in early 1933,[11] but the U.S. did not return to 1929 GNP for over a decade and still had an unemployment rate of about 15% in 1940, albeit down from the high of 25% in 1933.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression#Turning_point_and_recovery"
"I don't even have cable tv you fucking idiot. And coal is dying because of natural gas and solar being cheaper, not because Obama ""shipped out jobs to India and China."" You're the perfect example of a brainwashed Trump supporter. You only know what Fox news tells you, which is all lies. Job Growth started under Obama and was stronger under him as well. This is the only fact relevant to this conversation. Anybody that thinks anything changed when Trump took over or that he's responsible for the last 6 years of growth is a dumbass."
Nope, just my observations over the past couple years as someone that visits and reads both subs. 
u/cryptochecker
"Your 3 vague assertions (what about the sanctions he's **illegally** refusing to enforce?) don't stack up against the dozens of times that Trump has been cucked by Putin. Read the links. There are far more examples within.

> DoN't GivE Me InfORmatIOn I'M alLerGiC To iT WaaAAah!

That's you. That's what you sound like."
If you want facts how about the fact that the middle class tax cut goes away in 10 years but the rich tax cut is permanent?
Obama entered an agreement that made the US lose jobs and gave them to other country’s look up Paris agreement tard. Of course I’m brainwashed but you cannot produce facts for your claims of course job growth will look substantial after a recession don’t be stupid
"Yeah I don't think so....

You're a heavy /r/bitcoin user. The standard play is always to accuse others of what you're doing. Only the dotard and bitcoin subs consistently ban users for posting opinions outside the hive. 

Donald supporters on politics and core supporters on btc might get downvoted to hell, but they don't get banned. The opposite is not true. That's the difference. 

Again, it's very likely that your personal biases are causing you to misinterpret the situation. Don't feel bad. It happens to everyone and it's literally your brain trying to keep you alive 'cause it thinks you're still in the jungle. 

You can only break that mold if you try. "

"You clearly have no idea what the Paris agreement even is, because it had zero impact on jobs. It's completely nonbonding, and none of the requirements were ""shipping out jobs to China and India.""

And once again, coal is dying because of cheaper natural gas, not anything Obama did."

"> Don't feel bad. It happens to everyone and it's literally your brain trying to keep you alive 'cause it thinks you're still in the jungle. 

Ok, /r/iamverysmart.

> You're a heavy /r/bitcoin user.

I haven't posted there regularly in a long time. Pretty much since the sub went full retard in 2015 thanks to Theymos. I still check it often and occasionally chime in (which usually results in people attacking me because I am also a regular in /r/btc). So far I have avoided an outright ban.

> Donald supporters on politics and core supporters on btc might get downvoted to hell, but they don't get banned. The opposite is not true. That's the difference. 

You've got it backwards. /r/btc users get banned on /r/bitcoin all the time. If you don't believe that then I don't know what to tell you. The only reason this sub is popular is because of the mass censorship and constant bans.

Yes, that's what I am saying. We're agreeing here. "
Sounds like you misinterpreted my comments then. 
"Or vice versa. Either way, we got it turned around somewhere. 

But you originally said that ""/r/bitcoin is /r/politics."" when in fact the ""mass censorship and constant bans"" (your words) are more akin to the_donald. 

Clearly put the analogy is:

Censorship and bans for all dissenting opinions: /r/bitcoin, /r/the_donald

Heavy downvotes for those who go against the hivemind: /r/btc, /r/politics

I mean, that's the observable pattern to an outside user. If you disagree with that, then I'd still argue that some personal bias is causing you to misinterpret the situation. "
"To be fair, I kind of stopped paying attention to /r/the_donald a while ago, maybe it has changed a lot for the worse. American politics is exhausting. I remember like a year or so ago it was gaining a lot of users due to censorship from /r/politics and other subs like /r/news. Sure the headlines were mostly memes and shitposts, but often there was a lot of good conversation in the comment threads that you wouldn't find in most other subs. Also have read many stories about users that have been harassed, vote brigaded and outright banned from various subs simply due to the association. The parallels to me seem pretty close. I also find that /r/bitcoin is way worse for the hivemind aspect than /r/btc (which can be bad at times as well). 

"
"A year is enough to cause economic growth. Or is what's happening with the stock market and gdp not ""economic growth"". It's all happened within the past year. You're confusing ""growth"" with ""full recovery"""
Because....
Oh yeah Obama’s policies??? Haha what about the global warming climate change deal bullshit Obama established which takes coal mining jobs out of US and gives them over to India and China. That is only 1 example. You are perfect example of a libtard. Just turn off CNN and read an article or a book do your own research.
Whatever floats your boat my friend.  Some people think OJ got a bum wrap, Chris Brown was the target of haters and Putin is the legitimately elected leader of Russia.  
Agreed
"Higher taxes from Bernie.
Lower from Trump.

Simple."
"Promises kept:  Marriage Equality, Stronger Consumer Protections (CFPB given more power, etc.), Increased Environmental Protections/Regulations... that's just the top level, birds eye view stuff.

just saying he was very clear about the kind of president he would be.
the premise of your question is inaccurate where it is not vague 
"In terms of the economy, yes. And in case you forgot, the first couple years under Obama the economy was still shit. Things didn't start picking up until a few years in. 

edit: https://www.npr.org/2017/01/07/508600239/what-kind-of-jobs-president-has-obama-been-in-8-charts

Unemployment peaked at around 10% in 2010 (thanks, Republicans). "
Do you think the economy reacts to stimuli overnight? 
"The only delusional one here is you. Have you been living under a rock for the last 10 years? GDP and job growth started under Obama, due to his policies. Job creation and gdp growth has actually been lower under Trump so far in his first year. These are public figures you can go look up right now for the past eight years if you'd like. 

Bush (Republican) wrecked the economy, Obama (Democrat) fixed it, and now Trump (Republican) is in the process of wrecking it again. Wait another few years and you'll see the impact Trump and Republicans have on the economy. I love how they try to sell themselves as the fiscally responsible ones when for the last 30 years every single recession has been a result of Republicans and Dems are always the ones to clean up their mess. "
Clean coal create plenty of jobs and more coal mines will also. Shipping them overseas does not help our economy. Look up TPP and Paris agreement those are only two, I’m not gonna sit here and give you all of them, do a little research. We are switching to healthier alternatives like solar nobodies getting rid of it we just arnt getting rid of jobs. Of course 1 year won’t have huge growth but this boom is from trump if you have facts that prove otherwise feel free to provide them. I’m pretty sure Obama’s first year in office was not so great how about going back and checking out how GDP growth was or how about the unemployment rate then you will start to see
It's been over a year... so had lots of time to react.
Don't give me infinite amount of links tell me what did Trump do to serve the Russians. I already gave 3 actual examples of real decisions made by Trump that do not favor the Russians.
Oh he can't throw Hillary in prison immediately but he can fix the economy by just getting voted in right? Doesn't have anything to do with the way the economy has been going for years.

"Being embarrassed to be an American under Trump

I don't mind higher taxes if it's actually being used to fix our failing infrastructure and other major problems that the Government was created to help/fix. Taxes should not be the only motivation for your political views.

If anything /r/bitcoin is more like /r/the_donald - both depend on censorship and propaganda to keep their base of support.
Haha especially when the market has been mostly improving for years, of course Trump did it all! Fuck that noise, nothing makes me more fired up then bullshit politics.
The flippening would have happened. Now you are left with another Litecoin 
fun idea, next time use orange or better green hats and a slogan that doesn't remind me of you know who i mean :) 
BUILD BIG BLOCKS! BUILD BIG BLOCKS!
Anything that parodies Donald Trump is automatically trash. I would give all my crypto away for free before wearing that piece of shit. 
Finally. A hat that references political racism. Sad.
Make Bitcoin crash again, I forgot to load up
"Like this sub doesn't already have enough of a r/The_Donald vibe to it already!

I would have liked that better.

Bitcoin will always be the father Crypto of all coin for the next decade for sure even with declining transactions."
Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin!!
Better!
I thought the same. Would fit much better
What do you feel like the hat is implying?
"Mental gymnastics. I hope you are diversified.

Bitcoin is still running the Bitcoin blockchain."
To be honest I can't think of a politician who followed up on more and more significant campaign promises than Trump. He killed Net Neutrality, reduced taxes and removed a lot of regulations. He tried to repeal Obamacare but the republican establishment blocked him but even then he was close.
Good one! And broader appeal too. Make it, sell it. I'd wager you'd make some good cash yourself.
"32MB ;-)"
It's a meme.
"Are you implying by wearing a red hat similar to those that republicans often wore is somehow bad for the brand? 

You realize Bitcoin and Bitcoin cash doesn't choose sides. That's for individuals to do. Bitcoin does not have any outright brand management team. If you don't agree with red hats and want to wear a Bitcoin pussy hat or I'm with Bitcoin Cash shirt nobody is going to stop you.

Live and let live friend."
Why do you think it's not good PR? I'm just curious. 
I’m working on it !
I would buy this hat if it was green
Why?   Because they're  piggy backing off of yet another brand?  
"So many people triggered by a hat.

Done it. My bitcoin is (half) cash again 
"I don't like it. Hat wise. Because of the implication.

I like BCH, though."

I'd say this works if what you want is hype and piggy back viral marketing....but if it's targeted toward anyone not already in crypto they will already have a preconceived notion and love or hate BCH without even researching it.
I like this.
Tasteless
Be careful wearing that. Wouldn't want my BCH buddies to get beat up by antifa
Sorry but I'm not wearing this. While it can be fun as a joke, it's still just not good PR imo.

Yeah but the point is that other politicians do basically nothing from what they promise or the promises are insignificant changes. Trump may have implemented only 1/5 of his promises but they are still bigger deal than what any other western politician did. You can even claim they are bad changes but he still followed through

Too lazy to google now but I clearly remember preelection articles on Ars Technica saying that Trump victory would mean NN repeal. Now I doubt Trump ever talked about it (has he said anything about it even now) but the issue must have been on the table somewhere with his team fighting for organic internet. However these 2 promises alone are bigger changes than what any elected official in recent times delivered.
Lots of reasonable, upstanding lifelong Republicans who thought he would be less crazy in-office are getting their minds changed. 
Does it change? In what direction?
Lowest black and Latino unemployment, massive GDP growth, less tax burden for the working man, stock market all time highs... I'd say those are amazing accomplishments.
"I try to be very open minded and accepting of other perspectives, but you lost all credibility when you used the word 'libtards'.  

Double check your news sources.  If you agree with them all the time, find new ones.  It's good to be discerning and challenge that cognitive bias that we all experience at times.

I don't hate Trump, but I am worried about some of the things he's doing.  The economy is doing well at the moment, but it's impossible that Trump can claim much responsibility for it, only a year into office.  I do think cutting the corporate tax rate was a good idea, but his people overstate the impact it will make."
Found the bot.
Don’t worry about the whole “puppet of the Russian state” thing though. No big deal right?
Much sans, very comic
Be careful, these people don't respond well to common sense. Sure, Trump has made the economy boom and reduced regulations and is upholding all his promises but even mentioning his name triggers them to the extreme. YOU FASCIST RUSSIAN BOT REEEEEE!!1!1!1!
so will you fork off when we go from 32 to 100mb :)
The full nodes (pools or solo miners) can set the limit lower themselves, so going higher doesn't necessarily mean that the actual space usage will follow.

"Who is ""us""?"
I dislike trump but I would wear this for the lulz
"Can you explain your pov. I get the feeling you fall left of center so I just want to hear why you feel this confirms a stereotype. And rather, what stereotype are you infering to?

Small government? Anti PC? Tongue in cheek Trolls? Or are you going full regressive and associating this with Hitler and alt right?"
"It’s intended to make fun of the trump hat concept, and instead use it for “good”.  

It’s not intended to say we are Trump fans and like anything about him or his hats. 

You simply don’t get the joke. 

However you may have a point, as there a lot of people in the world, like yourself,  that aren’t smart enough to get it. "

"Oh. I don't really know much about the Trump campaign. 

I searched it and now see what you mean. Yep, I don't like the resemblance either. "
It's just a hat lol calm down.
I'm on the forums since 2012.
I'm not even that much into Trump. If I was US citizen I would vote Rand Paul and then GaJo. I am just pointing out that Trump does what he said he'd do and brings bigger changes than any other politician in power in the western world.
What are you talking about mate? BCH bottomed at like 0.05 after the fork in August and we held 0.13 through this sell off storm sooo....
My point is that he said he would do it and he did so he is hardly one to make empty promises compared to other politicians who get elected
Because I don't want to be associated with a community (or a coin) that has anything to do with Trump. 
I know it feels that way from the headlines out there, but I'd suggest  doing some google searches and looking at specific numbers. 
I don’t get why his approval rate changes.  like him or not, he’s done absolutely nothing surprising.
"> He tried 

A for effort."
I don’t understand why you are being so downvoted. Donald Trump is making the economy boom again pushing companies to stay in the US instead of moving overseas, renegotiating terrible trade deals which would of cost us many jobs and money and like you said he delivers on his promises he even is pushing ILLEGAL immigrants out of the US and accepting immigrants that will be good constructive citizens not leaching off the government and killing cops. What is there not to like about trump? Trump made companies disclose their throttling so there is not a problem with no net neutrality also just because your poor doesn’t mean we all have to have the same internet speed that’s ridiculous. Don’t worry man just a bunch of libtards with no actual reasoning why they don’t like trump.
"I agree it's got a broader appeal. 

Could be a nice double sided tee:

_""War on Cash?""_

_""Make Cash, not war.""_

I'll print some for myself and friends, I'll leave it up to others to monetize it if they want.

/u/jessquit and /u/cryptartica , if you like the slogan feel free to use it"
Some of us like net neutrality and not breathing toxic fumes

21MB will do (21 Million Bitcoin)
150 bits u/tippr
Except for the part where he drained the swap right into all his cabinet positions. 
"No. It's an alt coin, hard fork.
"
$0.2 /u/tippr
Yes, and it makes us look really bad. Optics matter in this case.
"It undoubtedly is bad for the community, because it confirms a stereotype successfully used in propaganda against Bitcoin Cash and its users. 

But am I stopping you? No. I'm just calling a spade a spade.

Free speech."
I prefer comic sans
The majority of the world has a strong distaste for anything Trump related. You're hijacking a negative adds campaign. It won't end well in the long run.
"Great.  Again, you probably weren't here for the uasf push, hat movements are for idiots.

I don't care about the Trump connection, but why would you want to advertise with the slogan of a criminal anyways?"
"Wrong place for this but no one was asking for net neutrality repeal other than telecoms...  And I don't recall Trump making that a campaign promise.  He enacted a tax cut in a republican led... everything.  Out of all the campaign promises he's kept 2:  Tax cuts for corps and reduction of regulations.  I can't stand the guy so my bias is clear but I don't think ""promise-keeper"" is a title many would award him.

Edit: grammar"
because it associates Bitcoin cash with one of the most hateful, Science denying, tacky, obnoxious, lying, womanizing, trolling, bullying, populist, racist campaign slogan which for many implied making America White Again.
"The hard fork is plummeting vs Bitcoin

BCH has lost 35 percent of it's value vs BTC since it's inception.

BCH is just an alt coin, you'd probably have better luck getting ethereum adapted. Heck, my exchange, circle pay, hasn't given me BCH."
The part where Ver affliaites pay these people's salaries so they'll never agree with you.
