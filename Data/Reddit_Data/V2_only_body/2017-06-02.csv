"luke-jr wants to destroy Bitcoin as peer-to-peer payment system. And anybody who can read and think should know this by now.  

But it doesn't help to repeat this multiple times a day. We need an agenda to move forward on our own. And giving Blockstream what it wants by re-branding it as ""compromise"" certainly isn't the right way.

One investment is conditional on the incentives of bitcoin and inside the network. The other is not. It's intent of changing the rules from outside the network.

Even at the highest levels of society, incivility has become the norm.

Sidechains are pointless. LN is vaporware (the existing software doesn't do meet the sales pitch whatsoever). Yet you imply a likely multiple on their investment?
"It's all conflict of interest investment.

One group stands to win if Blockstream just tanks Bitcoin altogether.

The other group stands to win if Blockstream only tanks onchain Bitcoin altogether.

Successful stalling generates more fundraising for Blockstream.

Either way it's an assault on the free blockchain.  The blockchain was never meant to have a capacity cap controlled for the benefit of special interests of any sort."

ETH. Even us hardcore BTC people that have been here since 2011 have some ETH. It's the backup plan. LTC is dead and DOGE is a joke.. but DOGE is still a much better investment than LTC.
Those calculations are done using assumptions about our cosmology at the root.
Follow the money. 
It's as if their primary goal were to punish early adopters out of spite, because Adam Back, et al., declared Bitcoin to be 'impossible', and the real world humiliated them by showing their powers of divination and prophesy to be wrong.

I don't have the same info as you. If you could show me the income statement and prove your conjecture is true you could make the argument he is trying to kill bitcoin.

If he still holds even a tenth of the bitcoins he once did, that would be pretty hard since his Bitcoin gains alone would be in the tens of millions of dollars. And would have been an order of magnitude higher if not for this shambolic blocksize limit.

Just watch them. It seems crazy I know but it's legit. Took me like a year to come around though so not really expecting people to not think I'm crazy and that's okay. If a Core supporter can be convinced they have been lied to, then a ball earther can also. I'm not worried. Soon they will be saying I was the only one right about both.

ETH is great for a lot of things but I dont see it being the go-to coin for actual spending purposes out in the real world. LTC and DOGE could be those coins (but theres lots of other contenders as well), and BTC could be more like gold as a store of value that people dont really use much.

Something needs to be done about the fee situation. It's getting so costly to send BTC.

"I can't believe that some people on the comment section over there still deny that the altcoins are taking over.    
One guy even claimed that people will run from ETH once ETH gets more users because their fees will rise too.     
Bitcoins fees aren't high because of lots of users,  bitcoins fees are high because blockstream refuses to scale. It's not for lack of capability.    
ETH won't have that problem because ETHs devs aren't idiots."

u/luke-jr and you call yourself a bitcoin maximalist?  Where's your loyalty?  Where's your urgency?   Stuff like this makes you look like a liar or a fool.
[AXA strategic ventures](http://www.axastrategicventures.com) holds a controlling stake in Blockstream. I would suggest somebody inform them that the startup they sunk over $70m into is running amok and uses their funding to pay extremists and saboteurs and run coordinated smear-campaigns against other companies and individuals. It is unclear to me how AXA is going to recoup their investment when Blockstream does their best to destroy any foundation upon which they could do so.
Don't worry, once we get everyone to stop using Bitcoin the fees will come back down.
"There are people, I don't know if Luke's one of them, but quite likely.... anyway, there are these goldbug people who think that since ""Bitcoin's closest competitor is physical gold"" then the marginal cost of a Bitcoin transaction is the cost to send physical gold anywhere in the world in about an hour - ie the closest alternative to Bitcoin would be to expedite a gold shipment.

Lunatics.  Maximalists to the point that they don't even realize that altcoins are *actual competition.*"

"That's a big if.

And his profits off ETH/Dash/Monroe/Zcash would be much much larger since they all experienced 20x+ price rises since Ver created this sub. 

Even if somehow he didn't invest enough in those Alts to where the profits off of a 20x rise didn't exceed the profits on a 3x bitcoin price rise (unlikely), then he certainly at the very least has as much capital tied up in altcoins at this point as he does in bitcoin. 

He couldn't possibly care less about the price of bitcoin. He cares about the cumulative price of all of his cryptos."
"Don't call them maximalists.  I've even been called a maximalist by the people you describe.  They are fine with using altcoins or, as the subject of this thread indicates, suggesting that Bitcoiners use fiat.  In fact, they have even defended the idea of national currencies to me in the past.

A maximalist is someone who believes that there is no need for any other currency besides Bitcoin.  You can see from my [prediction](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=325284.0) years ago that the obvious economic effect of re-purposing Bitcoin as a settlement network to compete with (expensive) money-transfer services is to prop up other currencies, the US dollar especially.  And that's pretty much what has happened, albeit with alts instead."
AXA is an insurance company. They don't care about the block stream investment that much because it's likely they will get a multiple on their investment either way. If sidechains work they have a large position in a patented technology and they are set. If at the same time they made this investment they also bought $1 million in coins then if sidechains are dropped (or dropped for now) they just liquidate their coin position. It's not 0 risk but it's a pretty easy sell to investors looking to make a multiple.
">AXA strategic ventures holds a controlling stake in Blockstream. I would suggest somebody inform them that the startup they sunk over $70m into

No. There is zero evidence whatsoever that the investment by AXA Strategic Ventures is a *controlling stake*. 

Hell, they weren't even a participant in the first public funding round! 


$70m is the **total** of the second public funding round (Spring 2016), and AXA SV was merely one of 9 companies to participate.

According to available public info, it was actually Horizons Ventures who led the second round, and who contributed someone to the board of directors.

But nobody cares about Horizons Ventures, because there's no juicy AXA - Bilderberg - Illuminati conspiracy. "
they recoup it indirectly by slowing down crypto adoption.
75 million is embarrassingly cheap for destroying Bitcoin  The real Bitcoin is the present global financial system's worst enemy.  Or, at least, it was.  Now, Ethereum appears to be taking over that spot.  It's like whack-a-mole for banksters.
But do his remarks make you question Core/Blockstream?
So do we go to LTC or DOGE?
Not /s
This seems like the goal of the developers, honestly. Why, I cannot imagine.
Alt coins are theoretical competition right now. They're even less certain than automated vehicles taking over all ground transportation in the next 5-10 decades.

No he doesn't want to destroy Bitcoin. He is mentally ill and people find it funny/suiting to their agenda to egg him on. Best thing anyone can do is to ignore him.
"Blockstream have $55m of funding to push people on to their centralised ""Liquid"" payment system but the only way that'll happen is if people are unhappy with Bitcoin. So they've got every reason in the world to sabotage Bitcoin. And now after what they've done people are certainly unhappy with Bitcoin but it hasn't really gone Blockstream's way - now development's been taken out of their hands and given to Jeff Garzik and people are just moving to other cryptos instead."
*We* know. But what about *everyone else*?
wow you guys are dumb. you do realize the OP was being sarcastic? luke-jr seems to have misunderstood as well.
