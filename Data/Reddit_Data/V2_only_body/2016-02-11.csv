now lets see if the ' nice guys ' at bitcoin.org will issue another pull-request ..
"Click links? Are you mad? This is reddit! :p

A /s tag at the end for the idiots like me would be nice. "
Not thick enough I guess. Cool pic references.
What if they are tonal? Not even god could understand wtf they mean.
But you don't dispute my claims but rather try to justify the badness with some perceived 'goodness', right? A means justifies the ends argument?
"> Solution simple: Fire CTO.

Sure fire way to know when a tech company is in trouble is when the CEO ignores advice from the engineers and talent."
I don't think that a mining pool without fees will be that expensive for coinbase.
"The main problem with the fork, for the scalable side, is that blocks under 1Mb would still be considered valid. So if the old chain holds a majority of the hash power, they would keep overriding the new chain with <1Mb blocks.

By adding any simple thing like a salt to the block hash we could render blocks on the different chains incompatible. The blocks from the old chain would be rejected in the new one. And this change could be done without rendering mining equipment obsolete, as the mining algorithm would still be the same."

It's pretty thick sarcasm. Look at the links.
But only few get it and it's more damaging for some to believe it.
I dunno if I can lay on the sarcasm any thicker.
Maybe he is doing it to himself to generate real support for himself. 
But what if his prayers aren't marked God RBF? :,(
Mission accomplished
"XT failed miserably? How so? 

Sure it didn't reach 75% support, but that's not the point. It introduced diversity to bitcoin clients. 

Apple and Google phones both play nicely on the same cellular network, and consumers reap the benefits of 'choice'."
"They run and test everything I have been told. Why wouldn't you if you had engineers sitting around and your future depended on it. It's not that they are jumping ship, It's that they don't want to miss the ship if it takes off.

Or they want to keep doing their business...

Some people just cannot understand that TPTB will fucking rape your company if you do not obey the rules.

Coinbase's procedures are completely normal and understandable."
Oh, is that what you're doing by refusing to clarify your wild claims?
Yeah, these private businesses providing services to willing customers are so Orwellian.

You are not forced to use coinbase. With Lightning, you will be forced to use those Orwellian Hubs.
Wow you're just a troll.
"Flash was the only useful solution back when HTML5 didn't exist.
In the absence of better alternatives, Core was useful once, too. :D"
Deflect and divert?
"You mean the business that got more people their first bitcoins and wallets then any other organization on earth? The one that kept operating while all other US based exchanges closed?

Yeah, fuck those guys, right. "
you best friend (or grandma or whoever) clearly shouldn't be using bitcoin in it's current state ... channelling everybody into something as Orwellian as Coinbase is a deal with the devil, no matter how much the centralisers want to gild the turd.

How is coinbase the biggest centralizing force in Bitcoin?

Or, when you're employed at a Bitcoin-based company, but in fact are supporting a competing coin (Litecoin) and make public statements highlighting your direct conflict of interest.

Gotcha, thanks!
Still leaves hashrate attack vectors wide open. If the network splits 75/25 the 25% chain could be extremely vulnerable
"Your example betrays you and supports my point. Flash is being replaced for being buggy and insecure in favor of better standards like html5. All the user wants is smooth HD video without his computer crashing, and engineers know how to deliver it with better technology. If the engineers listened to the users ""technical recommendations"" they would still have flash with infected and unstable computers. It is the job of engineers to listen to the needs of users but deliver them what they really need and want but not in the misguided manner that the users/CEOs request. "
This sort of post is not productive, let's keep it classy folks!

"The biggest centralising force in bitcoin (and collector of private user information) Coinbase just pumped a centralising version of bitcoin software .... and all the bitcoin centraliser crowd went wild.

Did I get that right?"
The twitter replies are a flurry of trolling and FUD. This isn't organic, it's a concerted, organized effort.
"Coinbase just doesn't understand. They don't understand that it is impossible that they could ever be as intelligent as Greg Maxwell or LukeJr. These men are pioneers of industry, and now rogue groups want to bastardize and steal their hard work. I mean, they created bitcoin, didn't they?

Bitcoin will never need more than [1mb blocks](http://i.imgur.com/qIUb1.jpg) because the [Lightning Network](http://i.imgur.com/TrEZBFI.gifv) will soon be here to fulfill all of bitcoin's scaling needs! Vaporware you say? I think not. Why would these men make up such things? I mean yes, they have stated that larger blocks will lead to mining centralization and that it will harm Chinese miners due to the Great Firewall™ while claiming mining centralization in China is a problem, but that is neither here nor there. 

If only everyone would just sit back, relax, and let the [professionals](http://thelibertarianrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/potuses-laughing.jpg) handle this most delicate and complex situation of changing one line of code, we will all soon be shown how [gracefully a soft fork integration of non-vaporware Lightning can be.](http://i.imgur.com/xU12HZF.gifv)

Everyone, there is no emergency. Those who claim differently are simply [peddling fiction.](http://lidblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/xafbo.jpg) Our financial Blockstream institutions are strong.

"
Big companies like coinbase should give incentive to miners. Like a classic mining pool without any fees. They can afford it and they will be the winner if classic succeed 
"Despite all of the emotional replies, this is a smart, rational business decision.

If Classic achieves 75%, then Coinbase is already ready for the switchover.  If it doesn't, then nothing has been lost.  There is no downside for Coinbase here."
"Coinbase, Bitpay and other large companies need to man up. Their business model cannot survive long term if Blockstream prevents a fork from happening.

You do not need to wait for miners. You hold the economic majority, and most holders are on your side. Do the fork, add an extra salt or anything similar to the block hash so that even with a minority of hash power the scalable chain remains alive. And set up a market for coins where people can exchange old for new coins. If Coinbase, Bitpay and Circle alone exchange the entirety of their wallets, that would give a tremendous price advantage to the new coin, what would eventually bring miners in.

Of course that will be chaotic, but we need to divorce from Core. Their vision for Bitcoin is not the same of those who have been onboard for years, and is incompatible with the business models of the major Bitcoin companies. 

We're running out of time. Just fucking do it."
BRAVO!
Hip hip hooray!  :)

So how long until any coins held on Coinbase fork?  This is going to be a shit show if they let it play out.

This is being downvoted, but surely it's satirical.
"I thought ""you probably don't even run a node"" was the best Re tweet, second only to ""f--k you"".

Intelligent discussion"
"Interestingly, anti-btc trolls (mostly buttcoiners) took over /r/bitcoin right after theymos started censoring forums and got rid of the pro-bitcoin followers.

I think it's a textbook example of an organized effort to disrupt an online community."

"> most delicate and complex situation of changing **one line of code**

actually just 2 bits. One could also *swap* 2 bits (ascii ""1"" -> ""2"" is decimal 61 -> 62 or binary 00111101 -> 00111110, so the least significant two bits of that byte are swapped)
