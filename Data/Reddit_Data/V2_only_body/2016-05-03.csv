Lol, indeed.
You have just put a smile on my face Sir, after going through today's barrage of hatred being thrown at people (that I generally like and respect) it's nice to end the day on a mutual agreement.
You haven't the capacity to tie your shoes by yourself let alone carry on a conversation. 
Amsterdam salad argument.
Turn the bot back on, that was more fun.
We agree.
It is clear that you are unwilling to defend, or even explain your position.
Good for you! Information from divergent sources is always best.
"> That's the only relevant fact here - the fact that he did not do this.

It's shown he's playing a different and 'interesting' game. And after all the pitchfork attacks I'm starting to appreciate it a bit more, its showing me the people that I'd rather stay far away from.

It's one thing to ask for information (as you have), its another thing to go full out 'pitchfork attack mode', its disgusting.

I guess I just have a bit more patience, that I trust Gavin and Jon was shown particular extra information, and I'm willing to wait for such information to be made public."
Sweet dreams.
Take your meds.
I am not *only* on /r/bitcoin.
"> what he'll release in the coming weeks

For him to digitally sign a message (and us to verify it) would take a matter of minutes.

That's the only relevant fact here - the fact that he did *not* do this.

Satoshi obviously would have done this, being a coder, not a showboat.

The fact that Craig did not do this, means that he should be ignored.

"Here it is:
>It's understandable that people are unhappy with how Craig is going about this. However it doesn't mean he's not Satoshi.

I am just trying to understand what you claim to believe and why. 

So far... Bupkis."
Now that you have had a chance to sleep on it, are you ready to answer the question?
Not needed when you're on /r/bitcoin :)
"Tbh I do still browse /r/bitcoin (rarely), sometimes decent news articles appear there. I read Theymos's post earlier, my response is;

They are reading far too much into Craig's initial blog post, its just a primer (explaining how to read a signature) for what he'll release in the coming weeks. 

He (Craig) never states anywhere that his blog post is proof that he is Satoshi. All the contacted media sources, Jon and Gavin, all state they were provided information (privately) and not one source refers to his blog post (as the information or otherwise).

Blockstreamcore (and cohorts, aka, Theymos), went into immediate damage control mode, showing how much they 'care' (read as 'shitting themselves') to denounce the blog post as proof he is not Satoshi (little realizing no one was claiming it was proof of).

The next few weeks will be interesting, Witness."
Apparently you are too stupid to tell the difference between a comma and a period. So what do you want from me? Sympathy? A couple bucks in your begging tin so you can buy a sandwich?  What? I'm sorry but I'm just not very good with the mentally handicapped. 
At some point on your life an authority figure must have impressed upon you that original thinking was a threat to your survival. It must have been at a very young age. 
And so you hurl insults instead of answering to your beliefs.
Yep. Ya retard.  Figure out what a comma is yet moron?
"Why do you say that? Which comma would that be?

>It's understandable that people are unhappy with how Craig is going about this. However it doesn't mean he's not Satoshi."
Amsterdam salad argument.
Understood... You have to take it easy with these kinds of traumatic revelations. Work at your own pace then.
Lol, if you ever wanted proof someone is disrupting the forum with bots, here's your proof.
[deleted]
So what else do you say bot? Pick up on key words do you? Blocksize, halvening, gavin.
And now, who has lost the ability to respond rationally?
"I don't think that anyone is disturbed but yourself.

Are you disturbed?"
That's creepy that someone is using a bot to disturb the forum.
Argue salad Amsterdam. 
You have yet to answer why you believe Craig Wright's claim. 
Argue salad Amsterdam.
Clearly you're a bot. Anything I say and you'll continue on your retarded direction.
You will say literally anything, won't you? To keep from admitting that you must defer to the opinions of others to support your beliefs. 
Argue salad Amsterdam.
"Stuck in a loop I see. 

Out of original thoughts are we?"
You're not even replying rationally bot. Stick to key word replies. Argue. Salad. Amsterdam. 
And now, you are fixated by this fantasy of a robot. Interesting, how you choose to divert attention from the subject of the foundations of your belief systems. 
Argue salad Amsterdam
Holy fuck sticks how did I end up all the way down here?
"I believe the same thing, but I still read r\bitcoin.

I have been extremely outspoken in my criticism of /u/theymos for his censorship.

But if you don't read his post today on Craig Wright, you're missing out:

https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/4hflr3/craig_wrights_signature_is_worthless/

Decide based on the post, not the person.


"
"It's true; and yes I believe it."
"Ye, good idea, staying here is the best place to keep informed ;)"
Gavin, is that you? :P
And cryptography. Cryptography and me. That reality
"> It's understandable that people are unhappy with how Craig is going about this. However it doesn't mean he's not Satoshi.

No, it *does* mean he's not Satoshi.  Nobody capable of designing Bitcoin would then attempt to prove his identity in such a full-of-holes way.  Designs as complex and successful as Bitcoin aren't produced by people who slap together plans whose shortcomings will be all over the web the next day.

I just can't imagine SN would be a person like that, I think he would never think about NDA's or anything like that, just like Andreas says

"What better to way to deal with a conman than to expose him?

Passing the buck to someone less thorough has only created this current situation of uncertainty.
"
You're not wrong. One of the best defenses against being conned is to realize that you are not immune to being conned.
"He locked the coins away with the preconception that by 2020 the avg value will be significantly higher and the usage far wider, so much so that the re-introduction of said coins would have a far less effect on the market (than it would if say released next year), partly under the belief that wider use in that year will also enable those coins to be spent as coins. He has more coins than just those locked away. 

How do I know this? (maybe my username), but I guarantee you along these lines is what he will say when the moment comes."
"from where do you gather this ""reluctance""?"
"People can ascribe power to Satoshi even if he doesn't want them to.  So the reluctance is the cult that would surround Satoshi when he is identified - but that can't exist if he's never identified.  

Secondhand evidence says Gavin has witnessed Craig Wright sign one block that Satoshi owns.  Which is great - its one more block than anyone else has signed.  But it's also suspiciously just one block, for those of us viewing from afar.  Maybe Satoshi only wants to convince some people, and not form a cult of Satoshi."

This has been used as defence in court, surely this sort of thing should apply to the current C0WS0N identity crisis.  Did you expect the inventors of this to be not mining and monitoring?
"Absolutely right.

I can't believe the man who came up with ""Bob is the new owner of these bitcoins --signed Alice"" didn't think ""Craig Wright is Satoshi Nakamoto --signed Satoshi Nakamoto"" was the way to prove his identity."

Thanks for staying sane.
Because Andreas has picked the authority he want to follow, so there is no reason he would go for another authority

Expect a reporter from the BBC to be in contact with you shortly. They're locked in a Satoshi exposure battle with Newsweek, and another Satoshi is just what they need to push them over the top!
Although subjective, I have to agree. It's like a movie that's no where near as good as the book. And, never meet your heroes.
That's for Jon to tell himself if ever he wants to.
It was in the next sentence of the comment you replied to. But seriously if you can't follow along by now nothing I say will help you.
Which word didn't you understand?
"You seem overly dogmatic in the r/btc direction.
"
[deleted]
That seems like a dig, but it doesn't really make any sense. Will let it slide.
No, it doesn't mean he's not Satoshi. Satoshi doesn't have to be the mental image of him that you happen to hold, following all the rules you make up for him to follow in your mind.  The world is more complex than that.
If you mean that I overly think bigger blocks are the way forward, then yes, I've felt that way since it was first brought up in 2013. I actually thought it was a non-issue even before that. I've sadly been proven wrong.
I don't know.  I'm not egotistical enough to claim to know what a guy would do when I never even met him.
Because I can recognize a simple fact?  I don't claim he is Satoshi, I'm merely pointing out that just because some people don't like how this is proceeding doesn't mean he's not Satoshi.  It's pretty basic reasoning.  More people should try it.
"I'm perfectly prepared to accept that Satoshi is an awkward, arrogant dick; the open source movement, and Bitcoin in particular, are replete with them. 

What gets me is that Craig doesn't seem to be honest or intelligent. The only explanation for a clever, honest man handling this event the way he has is that it's some elaborate plot in which we are not participants. Otherwise, he is not smart, or he's not honest, or both - and however little we know about Satoshi, he was certainly smart. "
John Titor?!
I know of the Gavin story, but who is Jon and what's that story? 
Why do you believe it is true?
"I'm just a simple man trying to shy away from the spotlight and who might also be Satoshi. Why is everybody making a big deal about this?

Fine. I'll prepare the draconian NDAs.  
Uuugh.

"Would Satoshi Nakamoto prove his identity by quietly, awkwardly and non-publicly verifying his identity to a handful of people?

Or would Satoshi Nakamoto, the inventor of Bitcoin, go down the public verification route?

The answer is obvious to me, I'd be surprised/shocked and crushed if this secretive and awkward man is Satoshi Nakamoto."
No.
"Satoshi was never a public person, his vigilance to remain anonymous for so long is proof of that so it may be he's not comfortable with going down the public verification route, but I still no justifiable reason to NOT go down the public route, until he explains himself I guess we sit here twiddling our fingers. I also must say that 5 years can change a person, I know for a fact I have changed drastically over the last 5 years. Satoshi also kept things very professional and was socially distant much of the time, comparing his online persona to his public one is not much of an indicator IMO.

One thing is for sure though, not supplying public proof he created the genesis block is hurting his public image a massive amount, and if he is SN, he's also hurting Gavin's reputation after he publicly fingered him as SN. CSW needs to smarten up and stop jerking people around if he wants to prove he is SN."
