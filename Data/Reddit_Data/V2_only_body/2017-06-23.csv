"> if you enforce a rule that limits transaction capacity...

I never suggested that it should be limited. I gave the number of transactions to show how much can be made from even modest transaction fees.

> PayPal and credit card are more akin to the Lightning Network

It doesn't matter what the differences are, if we continue to intend that bitcoin be used for direct purchases, then it is appropriate to compare it to other payment processors. "
It's true... Back in the day, a zero fee transaction would make it into the 'un-full' blocks... Miner's discretion I guess.
Lol, I remember the good old days when we could follow Rick's enthusiasm for  a profound a great invention, this is quite depressing.
"Maybe... but inserting an arbitrary growth rate in the code is not a good idea.  A few years from now, it can easily be too little or too much.  And the developers may have been replaced...

Anyway, a congested network is a broken network.  Any proposal that assumes that block sizes should be actually prevented from growing by an arbitrary block size limit is stupid.  The biggest damage that Blockstream caused to the project was to convince most everybody, even most big-blockians, that the max block size limit is an important parameter that must be raised only with great care, and cannot be ""too big"".  

Even if it was considered necessary to slow down usage, the sane way to do it would be to set a higher mandatory minimum fee, not a tight maximum block size. A min fee would reduce usage just as effectively as a max block size, but fees would be predictable and every transaction that pays the minimum fee would be confirmed in the next block.

"
"That is a good example of the pseudo-economics that gold (and now bitcoin) peddlers use to dupe their marks -- of which libertarians and ancaps are the most ""productive"" sector.

Inflation does not ""grow"" anything real.  You can think of it as a tax on holding money.  If the inflation rate (measured by cost of living) is 6% per year, and you spend of invest all your salary over the course of the next month, it adds about 0.25% to all the other taxes you pay on your revenue.

No one likes taxes, even if small, so it is not strange that lay people see inflation as a bad thing, and dream of a currency that does not lose value with time.  

But bitcoin shows why such a currency would not work.  People would hoard it, and that would actually inflate its value out of proportion: if 50% of the currency is taken out of circulation, the purchase power of each unit will automatically double.  That would lead to more hoarding and thus even greater increase. 

Then speculators would start day-trading it, causing its value to jump up and down like crazy.  Then it would become useless as a currency, and get reduced to a worthless token whose value is sustained entirely by the (baseless) expectations of traders and holders, like a pumped-up penny stock or an MLM franchise...

Thus a good currency must lose its value at a small steady rate, in order to discourage hoarding and encourage people to invest their disposable income into things that actually create new real wealth -- meaning actual goods or useful services that some population of *consumers* demands. 

Thus good government must increase the money supply faster than the growth of the economy, in order to maintain said inflation rate."
And I understand why you consider bitcoin's lack of inflation a feature...

"Luckily for us this isn't how the network works.  Hashers only need a constant and very small bandwidth to solve blocks.  Generation of the bits inside the block can occur anywhere else in the world -- presumably in a high bandwidth location.  But even if that location has low bandwidth an empty or small block can be generated.

Empty blocks still pay the coinbase reward so will remain valuable for 100+ years.  And some clever coding could also allow the bandwidth-limited node to create mostly-empty blocks, allowing it to reap the most valuable unconfirmed transactions.

An empty or small block lowers the average block size, allowing all miners with lower bandwidth connections to catch up.

In this manner, the network ""pushes back"" when its demand exceeds underlying capacity yet still rewards those who are capable of meeting demand with slightly greater revenue per block."
"With unlimited blocks, the incentives are all against miners filling their blocks with spam.  Especially with the current block propagation algorithm, that is much slower when the block contains transactions that the other party has not seen before. 

With a tight block size limit, it may pay for the miners to collude and generate spam in order to drive the fees up.  

Tight blocks are stupid in many dimensions..."

"> which he later changed, because he simply didn't have a solution to the problem of scaling.

There is no evidence for that explanation.  The limit was added in 2010, and there is a [good explanation for why it had to be added, and why its 1 MB](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6iuw72/for_all_of_satoshis_genius_he_couldnt_have_found/dj99v3q/).   Block sizes at the time were less than 10 kB, so running a full mining node was not a burden and the 1 MB limit had absolutely no effect on the system's operation.

In his opinion there was no scaling problem, and he never changed it.  He pointed out (twice, IIRC) that if traffic kept increasing at 50% per year or less, Moore's Law would keep the cost per node constant or decreasing.  

The ""scaling problem"" exists only because 50% per year is too slow for the hodlers who are waiting for ""the Moon"": they want Visa-level adoption, *now*.  Gavin and Mike would not promise them the ""Moon now"", but Greg did..."

1st: Big mining firms have too much power in terms of consensus. 

2nd. Satoshi described bigger blocks for his approach, but if you let that happen, you also get more centralized because more transactions are bound to a block, hence my argumentation of point 1 applies even more.

"> you have to concede that Bitcoin does not scale much beyond Visa-levels, and even then only at rather exorbitant cost

1. If Bitcoin managed even a significant fraction of Visa's volume that would make Bitcoin an unquestionable success; interjecting the word ""Visa"" into this discussion is a [red flag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana_fallacy).

2. The price of node and mining hardware, when priced in these Bitcoin, goes down tremendously over time, when adoption is allowed to proceed.

3. Visa-levels can be achieved with 300-700MB blocks.  This is certainly an achievable goal - even with today's hardware.  This sort of data volume is, these days, pretty trivial."
"> Regardless, as a computer scientist, you have to concede that Bitcoin does not scale much beyond Visa-levels

Getting 10% of Visa's traffic (i.e. 5000 tx/sec) would be a fantastic success.  

However, I don't see any chance of cryptos getting any significant use for legal payments.  The little that there was in 2013-2014 was motivated by ideology or desire to ""pump"" the price, not because it was a good payment tool.  I suspect that adoption for legal payments had been decreasing even before the backlogs.

On the other hand, if traffic continued to grow +50%  per year, it would reach 5000 tx/s in 18 years, by mid-2035.  But hodlers can't wait that long...

> and even then only at rather exorbitant cost.

That is an unfortunate consequence of its price having increased much faster than adoption.  It made mining an exceedingly profitable activity, and its cost then automatically increased to eat most of that profit. 

By the way, a large fraction of the traffic today seems to be due to tumbling (mining) for illegal payments.  A single purchase on a dark market probably generates 10 or more tumbling transactions; thus I would guess that tumbling accounts for 70-80% of the traffic, or more.   Online gambling may be responsible for a large fraction too.

"> As for Satoshi's technology forecast, I think Pieter showed fairly convincingly that 50% growth is optimistic, and that the real number should be closer to 18%. I'm curious to hear your opinion on that.

I am not aware of that estimate by Pieter.

[Traffic volume](https://blockchain.info/charts/n-transactions?daysAverageString=28&scale=1&timespan=all) (in transactions per day) generally has grown much faster than Satoshi expected, but irregularly:

    01/2009:     100
    01/2010:     150   +50%
    01/2011:     650  +333%
    01/2012:   5'200  +700%
    01/2013:  38'000  +630%
    01/2014:  56'000   +47%
    01/2015:  81'000   +45%
    01/2016: 188'000  +132%
    01/2017: 263'000   +40%

The large jump from 01/2011 to 01/2013 was almost certainly due to the discovery of bitcoin by illegal online casinos, dark market operators, and other criminals. (Satoshi disappeared in 12/2010, just when Ross Ulbricht was setting up the Silk road server.)

The slow growth in 2014 and 2015 must have been a reflection of the collapse of MtGOX and the slump in the price.  Perhaps the closure of SilkRoad helped too.

The max block size limit was hit by natural traffic around 01/2016, which may explain why growth was only 40% through 2016."
"That's ... not possible even in theory. The protocol contain no such call.

That the Armory client has had broken fee estimation has been known for quite some time.

UASF is an attack on the protocol for *technical* reasons too.
