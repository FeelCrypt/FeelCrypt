It sure does, my bad. I think he's exaggerating there.
"The exchanges are points of failure who bear responsibility, and Liquid is a trust based network, so effectively BS shifts power to the authorities since a much bigger percentage of the coins will be held by them out of convenience - see what BS announced: 

>The high latency of the public Bitcoin network requires bitcoin to be tied up in multiple exchange and brokerage environments, while its limited privacy adds to the costs of operation. "
I know, I've seen some posts about that with screenshots
As a bitcoin user you should be interested in how a large amount of bitcoin will be diverted to the control of just a few. This will impact crypto as a whole.
This particular journalist is very anti crypto/bitcoin generally, heres her article criticising PoW [https://www.forbes.com/sites/francescoppola/2018/05/30/bitcoins-need-for-electricity-is-its-achilles-heel/#6328da652fb1](https://www.forbes.com/sites/francescoppola/2018/05/30/bitcoins-need-for-electricity-is-its-achilles-heel/#6328da652fb1) , is this the sort of person you really want on your side of the argument ?.
"Yeah, I agree with it being irresponsible but you said ""exchanges own all the crypto"" which is factually incorrect.

Aside from your opinion, ""it should be 100% [solvent]"" nearly everything you said is flat-out wrong.

>but since exchanges own all the crypto

wrong.

>they can do with them as they wish.

not legally.

>No exchange has to give you back your money.

again, illegal.

>If it isn't in your wallet that only you have the keys to, then it isn't really yours.

Sensible, but still not legally accurate.

>People too easily give their money to exchanges.

Nobody is ""giving their money to exchanges""."
"And similar to Liquid, the Federal Reserve Act may well be the shadiest piece of legislation ever signed by a sitting President, drafted by a minority cartel of bankers and industrialists in secret to seize control of America financially. 

Even President Woodrow Wilson later lamented he basically just sold America to bankers wholesale, not unlike Blockstream seizing control of a radically new banking system through racketeering, extortion, and censorship. I remember well how they lied initially with grand promises only to show their true colors as Keynesian centralist scumbags-

> I am a most unhappy man. I have unwittingly ruined my country. A great industrial nation is controlled by its system of credit. Our system of credit is concentrated. The growth of the nation, therefore, and all our activities are in the hands of a few men. We have come to be one of the worst ruled, one of the most completely controlled and dominated Governments in the civilized world no longer a Government by free opinion, no longer a Government by conviction and the vote of the majority, but a Government by the opinion and duress of a small group of dominant men.  -Woodrow Wilson, 1914

I think its important to realize this stuff has been an ongoing blight on Humanity for over 300 years.

">Needs community buy-in, more testing and an ecosystem that has embraced segwit.

Dude wake up it's 2018, we now know that ""community"" is a made-up term for all of the sockpuppet Blockstream drooler social media accounts. If you're a human I feel sorry for you. ""More testing"" is a load of shit that is completely debunked by BCH currency - it forked with bigger block, works 20x faster than BTC, and underwent plenty of both real-world and simulation testing. 

Segwit, I don't know what to tell you, it's the best example of a change that a) wasn't needed b) didn't have popular support, c) added 6000 lines of technical debt-laden shitcode that doesn't accomplish much, and d) was rammed through in a series of dirty back-stabbing deals, On the flipside, the BCH chain gained plenty of transactional volume and Segwit caused a massive drop in BTC usage (since so many wallets and exchanges didn't/don't work with Segwit).

Edit: Also I haven't quite remembered the part of ""taking transaction fees"". I honestly have no idea how miners could have allowed it."

Im not sure most gold bugs actually think that, its more that gold tends to hold value between financial systems and is the ultimate hedge on fiat collapse, which is basically a certainty as every fiat every created imploded at some point. 
"> They literally say exactly the same thing

And they were absolutely right before 2009. Fiat systems end with hyperinflation, all of them. Why gold become so expensive? USD lost a lot of value. Since 2009 financial system of the future will be mostly crypto and partially precious metals (for older people)"
"You legally own the crypto if you can prove it was yours, and that that exchange has it. Which wont always be difficult, depending on how you got your crypto in the first place.

I didn't mean they own all crypto, I meant they have the keys and control of the crypto in their wallets.

Legality seems to be your sticking point, and sure. If they are found to be doing something wrong you may be able to take legal action. That is assuming they have their headquarters in the same country as you. If not then your options become very limited.

Technically it is access to the keys that gives you control, and true ownership. Legal ownership is a side issue, and gets into grey areas."

"Lol. That sounds like you're a coward.

What were they going to do? Punch you through the internet?

Build an API that sets off a bomb and fucks a child every time a block is confirmed. There's nothing they can do. "
"The really dumb thing here is: they could have spent $150 Million on deploying a mining operation and had a seat at the table making money that way, and fund other second layer tech that could have been lucrative utilizing tokens and such, but I guess that wasn't good enough. Its crystal clear they had other motivations to do what they did.

They spent that much money to hijack the protocol, throw the community into the shredder, conduct mass media attacks and build bots for this, steal the ticker, and gut it until it becomes Ripple. "
"That is a preposterously convoluted conspiracy theory.

If governments want to ban it they just will ban it outright. They won't have people exchange it for anything. "
"**Executive Order 6102**

Executive Order 6102 is a United States presidential executive order signed on April 5, 1933, by President Franklin D. Roosevelt ""forbidding the Hoarding of gold coin, gold bullion, and gold certificates within the continental United States"". The limitation on gold ownership in the U.S. was repealed after President Gerald Ford signed a bill legalizing private ownership of gold coins, bars and certificates by an act of Congress codified in Pub.L. 93–373 which went into effect December 31, 1974. The order was made under the authority of the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917, as amended by the Emergency Banking Act the previous month.

"Yeah, no. Tether isn't a real cryptocurrency it's just colored coins and a lot of bullshit. Ripple isn't a cryptocurrency either since, like Liquid, it uses bullshit federated trust.

You actually managed to pick two of the worst, good for you.

No the ones I'm tentatively interested in are ethereum, perhaps ada and the two mimblewimble ones. They are all, at least in theory, massively superior to bch in all performance metrics."
">The whitepaper does not say that we must trust ""federations."" It says ""*strong* federations!""

Bullshit, man, obviously you didn't read the chapter on TABS!"
Cats: all your base are belong to us
"Are you under the impression that bch fully implements the white paper?

With the replay protection and the changed balancing algoritm?

While it is possible that layer 2 could be a restriction it isn't a given. The federated bullshit that is Liquid could possibly be such a restriction. Lightning? Not so much."
Kraken might get shutdown over participation in this Tether scamm but I am hopefull they will at least not fall for Blockstream shenanigans, too.
No longer P2P, now it's B2B
"Primarily yes. Decentralization is the most important security measure bitcoin has. As long as it's blindingly obvious that bitcoin can't be shut down the other players, banks and states, will have to adapt (grudgingly). But as soon as capacity requirements centralizes the largest crypto into a few known servers? Then it will be over in one morning raid by federal agents.

States hate other currencies with a passion."
"Developer centralization is just a bullshit term. It's open source software. The security model of open source is that anyone can look at the source code. It doesn't matter who writes it, you choose what to run.

"
Correct me if I'm wrong but isn't a tool to facilitate inter-exchange transactions and improve liquidity a project that BAKKT listed as one of their undertakings? I did a quick google search and can't find where I saw it, but I'd swear I read that somewhere. If so how does that factor in?

"Selling access and hardware for a business platform touted as a Bitcoin sidechain.

Similar to how many companies take the free os Linux and packages it into units and services that companies pay for.

A well working base layer ie Bitcoin on-chain is vital for this to actually work."
"It's just one possibility of many, how you rate its likelihood dictates how you account for the probability. 

who could have predicted gold money could become illegal just 20 years after the Fed was instituted as the lender of last resort and shrunk the money supply of fiat? "
"Exactly. Off-chain is fine as long as it's things like individual businesses choosing to be exchanges, where they take sole responsibility for their security and liquidity, not crypto developers trying to shoehorn this kind of dysfunction wholesale onto the currency. 

&#x200B;"
Legal is a side issue. It is irresponsible to leave your crypto with an exchange.

Blopple!
"Well they do preemptively ban you if you have ever posted on ""unapproved"" subs. I'm completely serious"
">Yes. Changing an implementation and changing protocol is different. It's completely possible to rewrite a client completely while still following the same protocol.

O_o

Segwit completely changed the system... It changed even the *incentives* FFS.

Just stop."
"> No exchange has to give you back your money.

People can do whatever they want about anything but that doesn't make it legal. They do not ""own"" your crypto."
Please let know what blockstream business plan is?
">It's completely possible and even completely okay to build stupid things on top of Bitcoin and it doesn't make Bitcoin any worse in the process

But that's the thing: Sidechains were used to justify the divergence of Core from the original roadmap which BCH fulfilled but had to be a minority chain in doing so because of this misguided justification. The fracture of the community and the original roadmap being abandoned (by the majority at least), resulted into Bitcoin being worse."
Not even. Blockstream is still a third party.
So looks to me like there are multiple angles of attack on centralization. Developer centralization being one of them. BTC is far more centralized in that regard and IMO and you can corroborate this by which one is no longer feared by the banks.
Thank fuck Binance still holds their reputation as solid
It is based on tabs.
Seriously tho. For the longest time reusing an address in iota made you vulnerable to theft lol

I should have clarified, I meant B2B as Blockstream to Blockstream
"Crazy I know. As it is in a financial crisis governments could duplicate (employ) Blockstreams sidechain and include committee inflation controls on their fiat sidechain.

They could then issue another [Executive_Order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_6102) ""forbidding the Hoarding of ~~gold~~ BTC"" and force people to trade BTC for Sidechain at a government-mandated rate before making it illegal to trade with BTC. 

the precedent is illustrated in the executive order link. "
That's true. I could change the blocksize on my client if I wanted to. I don't though.
"I understood that you meant 'control' when you said 'own' and when you said 'give' you meant as custodial ownership (not a 'gift').

You make some valid points but the way you characterized them with hyperbolic words invalidated nearly everything you said.

If you don't use as much absolute language, you won't have to walk back your arguments.

Also, I do feel the need to apologize as I'm kind of being a pedantic asshole and I mostly agree with what you were saying."
"Yes, though I think that came down to a simple ignorance leading to over-reliance on Core devs, largely due to the language barrier and a level of technical incompetence in terms of not having a deeper understanding of the protocol, plugging in hardware and turning it on really doesn't require much thought. Its only been fairly recent that miners seem to now understand their role in the network better.

Thanks to massive price manipulation with bogus instruments like Tether, miners have no incentive to not mine BTC as long as it is profitable to do so. But as we are witnessing, Blockstream is trying to cut miners out of the picture, so we'll see how long that lasts. 

"
Cognitive dissonance is in full force.
"It is good to use proper terminology. Which zi dont mind being pointed out. A lot gets lost in an argument when people are using words with ""close enough"" definitions.

It's almost been a slogan since back around 2011 that ""if you dont have the keys, you dont own the coin."""
"The point is that if bitcoin is weak enough that a company like blockstream can kill it then bitcoin doesn't deserve to live. Cryptocurrencies are made to be as indestructible as possible, it's a key part. 

What I don't understand is how offloading the chain is going to cause the chain damage. You don't have to use liquid, blockstream can't force you to do anything. If blockstream and friends want to move to layer two that can only be good for the rest of us."
"Remember when the governments banned gold to stop people from using gold as money and forced them to exchange it for note. read the history in the link. 


FYI just 20 years earlier when JP Morgan was testifying in front of Congress back in 1912 he said:

You could buy USDT it's called ""Tether"" or perhaps some XRP ""Ripples"". Have a nice life."
Optimized for what? Decentralization?
"It is, but at the same time the original Bitcoin protocol proved that *we can and have* done better than centralized fiat, and it could indeed be done with an entirely new breed of currency backed by cryptographic supercomputing that was also turned the old corporate governance model inside out. This has the power to democratize finance the same way the Internet put an end to centralized publishing and opened the floodgates on doing business at a global scale.

This, however, is why the financial incumbents hate Bitcoin and have worked tirelessly for years to put a stop to it, unsuccessfully I might add. While they screwed up BTC they just opened Pandora's box wider, since there are now 1000s of networks.

"And the small blocker way offer them even more job due to all the complicated sude solution needed to make it work (LN, sidechains...)

"> What were they going to do?

First, they were going to undermine my code directly by making it malfunction at critical times. I prevented this directly first by excising someone from access to my code, then ultimately removing the source from public access entirely.

Then, they undermined my work indirectly, as well as many others, by rendering its purpose useless; in my case, there was no demand for 0-conf risk assessment in an environment that even an algorithm cannot reasonably predict (namely, multiple high-congestion events).

In that, they were successful. 0-conf risk assessment algorithms have been worthless for BTC ever since. There is no purpose in reviving that dead project. Happily, more advanced algorithms designed for BCH are already in use now, so that avenue is moot as well. I could easily wash my hands of the whole disaster that was my relationship with BTC, were it not for the periodic unsolicited reminders."

Block size centralization is just a bullshit term. It's open source software. The security model of the open source is that anyone can choose their own block size parameter. It doesn't matter who writes it, you choose what to run.
Think of it backwards. It was made possible by just *not* increasing the block size.
this level of BStarded is why we can't have nice things.
