"Don't you think ""good"" and ""bad"" are subjective? Just like ""right"" or ""wrong""? Good or bad for who'm? In history the winning side is usually remembered as good. Freedom fighters can be labeled as terrorists, since they essentially are terrorists in the eyes of people in power.

I don't think censorship is good in any case. People need to form their own opinions based on all the information available. Everyone has an agenda, nobody is honest about everything. To quote star wars: ""No good guys, no bad guys, just business"""
