Cool thanks 
"u/ratboy3rw I'm posting here because many pro bitcoin advocates are banned from r/bitcoin. 

the best explanation I have for you is regarding what backs up the value of bitcoin is:

1. money is a technology - while gold has utility it's not the utility that give it intrinsic value, it's, its intrinsic properties that make it good money. Money is primarily a ledger.

2.  it's the network of users that add utility to money.  Metcalfe's law correlated very closely with the rise of bitcoins value giving credence to this theory. see: https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3x8ba9/bitcoins_metcalfes_law_relationship_between/ 

3. bitcoin is a paradigm shift in that it has all the properties you want from a hard money like gold with none of the physical constraints. "

"Bitcoin QT is the same team as Bitcoin Core minus the Mike Hernia and Gavin Bamblozzedson (which means an upgrade) so gtfo.

And satoshi was right because he predicted ETH/ETC tier disasters. Enjoy the price going down the shitter to never hit an ATH again if the fork actually happens."
