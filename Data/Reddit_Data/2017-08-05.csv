This is dumb. 
It's centrally controlled, in that case. 
The divide arose because the mods of /r/bitcoin started trying to manipulate the perceptions of people in that sub.

Very good read. So far we had the initial bitcoin is finally worth something (10 000 for a pizza). Then we hit 1 and very quickly 10 and then 100 and then the first big drop. Then 1000 and a big drop. And now 3000. Nobody knows what is next.

The US government running Bitcoin software doesn't make it centrally controlled. That's the whole point behind the algorithm.
"> The divide arose because the mods of /r/bitcoin started trying to manipulate the perceptions of people in that sub. 

The divide rose because of a fundamental disagreement on the future of Bitcoin. /r/bitcoin mods did a lot of things, but manipulation wasn't one of them: they were *very* clear on their intent.

> The censored nature of /r/bitcoin compared to the non-censoring and transparent approach of /r/btc 

It's censoring via oligarchy vs censoring via groupthink. I've had a ton of deep discussion threads at /r/Bitcoin about big blocks, BCH, etc. Here you get instantly downvoted to -10 if you are pro-segwit or, in my case, want to *wait a while* for a block size increase. 

>  /r/btc is more likely to closer to the truth because people are allowed to be exposed to arguments from all sides.

And there's the rub. You aren't exposed to all sides. This sub is 100% big blockers and a mix of anti-segwit and indifferent to segwit (although the former is the majority). 
"
"That would be harder to answer. 

Maybe it's better for people who prefer a chain without SegWit for whatever reason. Also historically, LTC development has been pretty much non-existent, but it's too early to say anything about Bitcoin Cash development.

I value Bitcoin Cash more because it keeps original properties/incentives of Bitcoin and offers a good fallback in case there's some problems encountered with SegWit(2x), which I think is a bigger change to Bitcoin's incentive structure."
Well for once BCC favours the user and User Experience (low prices, faster transactions) is what I believe will ultimately win out. I believe this will happen thanks to decentralisation. The BCC fork demonstrates that there is no monopoly on software. BTC wants Segwit? Fine another alternative will spring up and the market will decide. Thats the thing with decentralised networks, the centralised will ultimately fail due to inefficiency. They may get wins early on but ultimately they will crumble due to the network finding the best way.
Thank you for posting this. Helped me understand what's happening a *bit* better. 
This is actually quite interesting: taxes, fees, and produce has been denominated in precise amounts even in societies without physical coins used widely. When I say 'coinage', I'm referring to the usage of physical coins. For example was taxes in the Holy Roman Empire defined in coins never minted, just defined conceptually. This is covered extensively in the aforementioned book, it's really worth the read.
"And it is not just that they exclude them, its how they include them. So even though they include house price indexes, they don't directly include it, rather they impute rents, which makes a housing bubble look like a less then 2% inflation:

http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2014/02/24/housing_inflation_the_cpi_is_a_disaster.html

Rents did not rise as fast as house prices. Just as stock PE ratios have gotten worse, PE ratios are less important than speculation on the movement of the herd."
It's not a scam. It's backwards looking (Greenspan likened it to driving while looking on the rear view mirror) and is more like a cost of living index than an inflation metric. This is ones reason why the gdp deflator is more often used.
">  I don't think it was naive to create a disinflationary currency. It was created with gold as an example

He used the gold mining analogy once in two years, yes.

> also a disinflationary currency

Gold is no longer a currency.  It has become a tool for the gambling game called precious metals speculation, and as such it is too volatile to serve as  a currency of commerce.  It is definitely worse than the dollar and the euro in that regard.

Gold is not really disinflationary either,  because it is continuously being mined, and the production grows as the price rises.  While the total amount of minable gold on the Earth is theoretically finite, the end is so far away that it can be ignored.  

On the other hand, it is true that the mining of gold is not connected to the growth of the economy; which contributes to the volatility of its price.  That is why it had to be abandoned as a backing for national currencies.  

Basing a currency on a ""digital gold"" would be a step backwards over a cliff.  The limited supply leads to speculation and volatility, as we have seen since trading started in mid-2010.  

The fact that the backing ""asset"" is digital removes the only qualities that made it a passable store of value in the past: its intrinsic value and its physical scarcity.   While bitcoin has a limited issuance, the number of cryptocurrencies is unbounded.  One can create infinitely many cryptocurrencies that have the same properties as bitcoin, but distinguished only by name -- like twin siblings.  Imagine how much gould would be worth if anyone could create a new metallic element, just as shiny, colorful, malleable, inoxidable, etc. as  gold...

I am saying there is nothing inherently good about inflation.
"It is sometimes directly relevant to technical issues, such as incentivization. But otherwise every time it's come up there's usually a flurry of ""take it to r/ethtrader"" comments. It's also against the sub's rules, so you can report those comments and they'll be removed."
"Yes, it says right what I said:

>Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments.  While the system works well enough for most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model. Completely non-reversible transactions are not really possible, since financial institutions cannot avoid mediating disputes.  The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions, and there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for nonreversible services.  With the possibility of reversal, the need for trust spreads.  Merchants must be wary of their customers, hassling them for more information than they would otherwise need. A certain percentage of fraud is accepted as unavoidable.  These costs and payment uncertainties can be avoided in person by using physical currency, but no mechanism exists to make payments over a communications channel without a trusted party.

>What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party. "

"This is missing the point. The dollar is simply the language we speak for doing business in the US. The role of the central bank is to provide stability, meaning stable prices. 

So why 2% inflation and not 0% or lower? The federal reserve wants to incentivize businesses and people to re-invest the money they make back into the US economy.
So when you say
> Why would you ever exchange something that increases in value for something that increases more slowly, or even decreases? If we assume this is true, there is no premise for holding cash to begin with.

You are exactly right, nobody wants to hold cash, because it is designed that way. Because of inflation...

If you want to do business in the US, your returns will be in USD, which sucks as an asset.

There is no economic zone associated with BTC except for maybe online drug trade.

"^ is correct. Fractional reserve permits banks to effectively create money by allowing multiple claims on the same dollars on deposit.

Now that transaction capacity is secured (at least for the next couple of years), companies and businesses can use it more.
"The value of bitcoin can never be more than the value of the goods and services (the value and wealth) it is being used to transfer.   

it may spike or dip over or under this value, and speculators and traders may make these waves smaller or bigger depending on the situation but the value of any coin comes from it's users,  the user is hiring the blockchain to transfer the value the user created as a good or service.  

Money is just a way to count who created what good or service. 

The goods and services are the value, not the coin.  

The coin that is cheap and easy and fast to use that provides the creators of real goods and services with the most benefits will be the most valuable coins. 

Only coins focused on user experience will succeed.  

Bitcoin and Bitcoin cash are now in a race to see who can make the most customers (users) happy. 

May the best coin win,,,,, but the customer (the user) wins either way.  

We demand cheap, secure, fast honest money,  and if you don't give it to us we will find someone who will.  "
It says this in the first goddamn paragraph. 
It will not so much fix it as provide an alternative. At scale it might some day replace it.
Under a fractional reserve system, inflation is vital. Without inflation, there is an immediate credit crunch. But it's not the other way around. You can't say we need inflation and therefore the current fractional reserve system is good. Inflation is a hidden taxation that end up in the wrong hands. Therefore we need to devise a system that does not need inflation to exist. Under the gold standard, inflation was non-existent. Under a cryptocurrency system, the same could happen.
"Interesting how you refer to the white paper but choose to distort it.

There is no need to validate transactions on your full node, *per the white paper.* I run a full node. I also have a significant Bitcoin stash. Guess what?

">Why would I purchase goods in bitcoin, which I know will be worth more tomorrow, when I can purchase the same goods at the same price in my local currency, which I know will be worth less tomorrow?

This is obvious. Because you don't have any cash, because you have all your money in bitcoin. You have all your money in bitcoin because, as you say, it will be worth more tomorrow and the cash will be worth less. 

Why would you exchange something that increases in value? Why do people sell rare coins or paintings? Why would you be holding something that decreases in value (cash) over something that increases? 

Thats why they say its important to diversify and not keep much percentage of your money in one spot, whether its one currency or one whatever. Also bc as you say the inflationary nature of our cash.

Why did the gold backed dollar work? It would've been worth more tomorrow than its worth today.

Its very obvious why one would part ways with soemthing that would be worth more tomorrow. Bc they found something else thats worth more to them. Why do you spend 100$ on a pair of shoes? cause, in that moment, you want the shoes more than you want the money. But those shoes? Do they increase in value faster than the 100 dollars you spent on em? No those shoes depreciate rapidly.

If you have any more questions just ask.

Why would you ever exchange something that increases in value for something that increases more slowly, or even decreases? If we assume this is true, there is no premise for holding cash to begin with. Thats where your argument is flawed. Its like youre suggesting you have an infinite amount of cash and of bitcoin, so you may aswell expend your cash first, since the bitcoin is better. But the thing is you dont have an infinite amount. and so if this is true, youd have most of your money in bitcoin right off the bat. There wouldnt be much cash to part ways with, bc as you say why would you ever want something that increases in value less, over something that increases in value more?

Right heres the problem, in this scenario, where its objective fact that bitcoin goes up in value and cash goes down in value, as each second passes, theres one gapingly obvious question. Why are you holding cash to begin with?

As you say, one might be reluctant to part ways with something deflationary in exchange for something inflationary or simply less deflationary, but by that same token that person must also inevitably be someone who is enticed by the prospect of exchanging something inflationary for something deflationary. So in this theoretical scenario, there is no reason why this person wouldnt already have all of their money in bitcoin (or something else deflationary, but they wouldnt be holding much cash out of any personal desire to. Again, as you say, why would you choose to hold something that will be worth less tomorrow over soemthing that will be worth more tomorrow?"
I've read every saved word Satoshi said.
"Because you asserting means its true. Please give me the blow by blow on how money is created.

It merely transfers temporary ownership just like the example i gave. You cannot spend it until i repay the loan. A bank expands credit, not money.

Alice deposits $10 into Bank A, they loan out $9 to Bob. The amount of money is still $10. Alice has no cash, but is promised $10 back in the future. Bank A has $1, but is promised $9 in the future. Bob has $9.

* Alice = $10 assets ($10 in paper)
* Bank A = $10 in assets ($1 in cash and $9 in paper) and $10 in liabilities.
* Bob = $9 in cash and $9 in liabilities

Still only $10 able to be spent. No money creation.

Bitcoin doesn't waver.   It's the rest of the currency are unstable.   Change your perspective.
"We need a lot more investors, users, traders, and holders before btc becomes stable enough to be used for the mass market. With stable, I mean a constant 10% increase per year. 

And no, it will not lead to people just holding instead of using ""because the value is higher tomorrow"". People might hold, but sooner or later people need to buy food and eat, and thus, will use it. Merchants will be glad to receive btc because of its increasing value."

"i edited my last comment but il copy what i think is relevant here:

>is the message that despite how it may seem from ""civilian sam"" 's perspective, hes actually better off being paid in tobacco (rather than gold) bc otherwise the businesses get richer and richer? You want to force the business to be paid in tobacco, so it has to pay some fees while converting it to a deflationary asset (investing)? Is that how this is supposed to help sam..? I mean does it? honestly asking, maybe it can. From my perspective i wouldnt think it was enough to really work its way back to sam with any real significance, even if it happens many many times very very often.. but maybe i'm wrong.


right so you soften the effects of the depression, but at what cost? because we all know sam isnt investing his money, lol. Idk. I'm not convinced this is helping us as much as we as a society want to believe. No one wants to believe its as ramshackle as it seems. No one even entertains the thought, and i don't blame you. I myself keep thinking i'm missing something. But at the end of the day no one ever says anything more directly explaining why we need this than what you were able to come up with. Just some vague allusions to how it might theoretically work. ""Oh it helps people in debt because it becomes easier to pay as money becomes easier to come by"" thats one ive heard. No one can actually explain each transaction from the moment it comes off the press to the moment it somehow winds up in sams pocket. I understand its theoretically possible. But in practice? No one has a practical explanation for why this is as logical as its bizarreness suggests that it must be.

Right so you ""force them to do something useful with it"" and they turn around and buy gold? and i guess the fees on that gold are what winds up somewhere down the line going back in to sams pocket? idk. Maybe. "

"My dollars are not appreciating in value. They're actually doing the opposite. Look up the inflation rate.

"> Is it the medium of exchange thing? gold used to be used as a medium of exchange. We actually STOPPED using tobacco as a medium of exchange BECAUSE of inflation. Given the option, why would a society gravitate towards, and go out of their way to, use an inflationary medium over a deflationary medium?

[The Great Depression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression) was a pretty good reason to move away from the gold standard. By controlling the supply of currency, the central bank has a tool to soften these boom-and-bust cycles, like we've seen with Bitcoin a lot.

By having this tool, an added benefit is that they can actually accelerate economic activity through artificially inflating prices. Basically making cash an even shittier asset, forcing its holders to do something useful with it.

You can argue whether one institution should have so much power/responsibility, but providing economic stability is a valid concern with many counter-examples throughout human history.
This is something that I have not seen addressed in the crypto-currency space and may never be addressed due to its decentralized nature."
"Well just to respond to one point - inflation. 

Consider that we have 2-3% population growth each year. If you didn't increase the money supply 2-3% each year, what would happen?  You'd have relatively fewer dollars chasing more goods, which would lead to significantly higher prices. 

In that respect, money supply increase is a prudent policy. "
"You should try to engage as opposed to just posting one-liners. Investopedia isn't always right. You're kind of a stupid tool though.

If that interpretation were true, then countries with no reserve requirements would be in periods of massive hyperinflation. Even the US's reserve requirements only apply to a small fraction of total deposits. I feel like I'm talking to a wall, but banks expand credit, not money. They exchange current dollars for future dollars. Notice in the Invetopedia example, Tom can no longer spend the $1000 he just loaned. He has given up that right in exchange for $1000 plus interest in the future.

Tamny explains it far better on how you need to look at both sides of the ledger:

""In truth, just as there are no sellers without buyers, there are no borrowers without savers; thus rendering the very notion of a money multiplier moot.  $1 million doesn't multiply into $10 million if it changes hands enough times; rather for someone to borrow someone else must be willing to cease using money in the near-term so that they can. That such an absurd bit of witchcraft has so long transfixed so many bright minds is one of life’s great mysteries. So while banks doubtless commit all manner of errors – capitalism is about both failure and success – the fact that they lend out the funds put in their care does not make them counterfeiters.""

That's OK. I consider all cryptocurrencies to be evolutionary descendants from Bitcoin.
So back then we used to think that Bitcoin would copy any useful changes made by the alt-coins, then crush them with the network effect. We didn't realise that for political reasons bitcoin would not only be unable to copy beneficial changes - or even find out about them, as positive discussion of other coins is systematically censored from its main discussion forums - but bitcoin can't even do its own routine maintenance.

Deflation as a result of a credit crunch is bad. During the Great Depression, deflation was bad. Debt defaults in large numbers are bad. But a currency that appreciates in value is not bad. Your dollars are already appreciating in value relative to cellphones or to laptops. And you still buy them. 
It clearly says here that what is needed is a trustless solution with no trusted third party. True peer to peer interaction. Anybody in their right mind interprets it that way 
I think the whitepaper left a few things unsaid. But the genesis block makes it pretty clear: Bitcoin is a response to the weaknesses in the financial system.

"NP, it was a fun one. Was just thinking about it, his argument was similar to a statement like ""if i have to eat, i may as well eat healthy"". Which makes a lot of sense.

Except his argument was basically, ""if i have to expend my stuff, why dont i expend my shittier stuff?"" what he fails to explain is why hes holding on to the shitty stuff to begin with. I dont know that it is or will be a viable medium of exchange (i have no opinion on that really, but i dont think its fundamentally impossible for bitcoin or something very similar to bitcoin to work as a medium of exchange), and i've participated in this sub and the other /r/bitcoin plenty. I just couldnt help but point out the multiple strange quirks in the logic haha."
"Ultimately, what is the nugget of truth youre trying to show me?

And really what is there to ensure price stability of anything? No ones holding a gun to anyones head insisting they treat USD as valuable. Theres not even a law that says a can of soda cannot be sold for more than one dollar, or more than 100, or even 1,000,000 dollars.

So really is there any protection? And what exactly is it protecting? And who is it for and who is it from? You know. Theres no protection. You cant force people to recognize the value of something or force them to recognize worthlessness of something. Or can you? idk. Maybe you can i actually dont know but yeah i mean at the end of the day.. the only thing keeping this going is momentum. Theres no underlying thing gauranteeing that every shop keeper wont wake up tomorrow and decide to raise the price to 100 for a can of soda.


And honestly do you even hear what youre saying. Do you see what youre proposing. OK so everyone has bitcoin. Now you say everyone stops spending it and starts hoarding it. So when they get hungry waht happens? you know. they spend some money. 

Youre saying the rich hoard more and more btc and become even richer? They are already free to buy what has always essentially been the equivalent of btc, gold.

I may be missing a point. I think you may be overestimating the significance of that point though. I did show why the guy is a bit clumsy in his assessment of the situation. Please though, explicitly tell me the point i missed so at least i dont go any further missing something.

Is it the medium of exchange thing? gold used to be used as a medium of exchange. We actually STOPPED using tobacco as a medium of exchange BECAUSE of inflation. Given the option, why would a society gravitate towards, and go out of their way to, use an inflationary medium over a deflationary medium? 


So ""civilian sam"" has the option of being paid in tobacco or an economically equal amount of gold. So why does he choose tobacco?

I guess maybe he doesnt cause who doesnt want a store of value right so he chooses the gold. But he wants it as a medium foofexchange right so im following... so when his stomach does start to rumble, why would he be better off converting it to tobacco before buying a sandwhich?

edit: or is the message that despite how it may seem from sam's perspective, hes actually better off being paid in the tobacco bc otherwise the businesses get richer and richer? You want to force the business to be paid in tobacco, so it has to pay some fees while converting it to a deflationary asse (investing)? Is that how this is supposed to help sam..? I mean does it? honestly asking, maybe it can. From my perspective i wouldnt think it was enough to really work its way back to sam with any real significance, even if it happens many many times very very often.. but maybe i'm wrong.

But heres the thing thats also all based on the assumption that sam goes out and exchanges his tobacco for deflationary assets too. But we all know that's not what sam does. Sams money just goes in the bank and stagnates at best and more likely slowly depreciates."

"But isn't also good for bitcoin that people use it as an investment?  
I think hodlers also give bitcoin the value it needs to be used as a currency. If there weren't many hodlers, the price would be lower and so there would be less miners. With less miners the system would be easier to hijack and thus unsafe.  
Besides that, you just simply can't expect people not to be greedy. Almost everybody is greedy and I think cryptocurrencies use this fact in a good way"
[deleted]
The greatest barrier to crypto being used as a regular currency for day to day transactions is price stability.  You have the HODL folks on one side (hodl != exchange), and folks afraid of potentially being stuck on the wrong side of a downswing.  Still, tons of potential once it calms down a bit, and even though use in exchange is limited, it is probably the only important example of someone creating a global alternative currency in recent history.
"Sorry to pour some cold water, but there is no evidence that Satoshi had those intentions.  

He definitely never claimed that bitcoin could replace national currencies.  Although he twice mentioned ""central banks debasing currencies"", at the very beginning (in the announcement to the crypto list and in the introduction to the whitepaper), AFAIK he never mentioned that again in the following two years.  

In fact, he barely discussed the currency and its economic implications.  His focus was the *payment system*.  Inventing a new currency was necessary to keep the payment system decentralized.  I am sure that, if he could have made a decentralized system work with dollars, he would have done so -- it would have made adoption much easier.

He made his new currency non-inflationary (as I would have done myself in his place), but that only confirms that he was a computer guy quite naive about the economics of money (as I was).

On the other hand, he wrote in the whitepaper that traditional payment systems work well for most purposes.

His answer to the ""scaling problem"" was to say that Moore's law would take care of it, because he assumed that traffic would grow more slowly than computing power per dollar -- that is, less than 50% per year.  At that rate, it would take decades to reach Visa levels, and even longer to reach the scale needed to replace national currencies.  And he only wrote that bitcoin *could* scale to Visa size; he never stated that it was *meant* to.

He also mentioned the privacy afforded by banks as an ideal that bitcoin could approach only if used with care.

The headline in the ""genesis"" block had a technical purpose, namely to prove to potential collaborators that the block had been created on that day.  (Otherwise they might suspect that he had been mining a chain in secret for years, and might dump it in the future to cause a total reorg, with double spends and all.)  Thus the ""message"" had to be a headline of a major newspaper of that day.   Arguably /The Times/ was the best choice of newspaper, for a project that aimed to an international user base.  (If one thinks about it, that headline has no relevance to currencies or payment systems.)

Thus, the picture that comes out of his writings is a computer professional interested in the technical problem that had been open for 25 years, with mainstream and naive views of economics.  Not at all an anarcho-libertarian reformer aiming to destroy banks and end the control of money by governments..

Space cash
You're welcome
Wait....so it wasn't invented so I can make a fiat money profit ? damn... Oh well, I'm already invested now so now I will try desperately to protect my investment and start trolling memes and creating and spreading propaganda I guess. BRB checking BTC/USD.
"Money is NOT created when you take out a loan. Only the central bank creates money. I borrow $100 from you. You can't spend it anymore until i give it back to you. That would be say defaulting on a loan destroys money.

I basically stopped reading here. So much bad info goes around here it is sad really.

FYI: BTC isn't sound money either since it cannot maintain a stable value. Since supply is fixed its value will be constantly pushed around by the demand to use it. Deflating is as bad as inflation. It just shuffles the winners and losers around.

Too much conspiratorial BS around here."
"Much of this is conspiratorial nonsense though. If this is the sort of logic that's led you to believe BCH is the ""real"" Bitcoin, no wonder there's so many upset BCash'ers

It is becoming more and more obvious that Bitcoin will.never be a true medium of exchange.  It's deflationary nature makes consumers strongly disincentivized to spend it.

Why would I purchase goods in bitcoin, which I know will be worth more tomorrow, when I can purchase the same goods at the same price in my local currency, which I know will be worth less tomorrow?

Bitcoin will be a new asset class, much more like gold then currency. "
Exactly. And that is also why i oppose Blockstream's solution of replacing it by a controllable Lightning Network.
Isn't it wild how quickly bitcoin went from saving us from the banksters to 'how can we be more presentable to banks?'
"Just a reminder . Trusting a mining cartel or some person to run and validate the rules for you is not peer to peer. 

In order to use peer to peer cash you need to validate the rules yourself so, 

1) Run a full node 

or

2) As described in the whitepaper use an SPV node with Alerts or fraud proofs (Doesn't exist yet so see option 1)"
"Could you describe that system we need to devise, or has it not been devised yet?

In other words, how do we end up in a situation where everyone has Bitcoin and Bitcoin is not rapidly increasing in value?"

Why do bigger blocks make BCC cash, and smaller blocks make BTC not cash?
"I know this will be downvoted to hell and I'll probably receive some threats  - but I personally believe using BTC to ""fix the financial system"" is a detrimental thing and as such I personally see it as an commodity/ investment tool... "
">This was what Satoshi Nakamoto described in 2009. It was a response to all the problems described above. 

This is your claim, not Satoshi's. What Satoshi ever said, was a response to 1st point only. Read the whitepaper again."
I think one of the best things about /r/ethereum is that any price discussion is flat-out banned. IMO price has always been a near-irrelevant sideshow in cryptocurrency, especially when considered in terms of speculation and getting rich quick. The really interesting stuff here is the *technology* and what it can be *used* for.
"I don't understand why bitcoin is different from cash, in many of these respects.

Can't I deposit bitcoin in a bank? They could choose to accept deposits, couldn't they? They'd accept all the risk around backups, cybersecurity, theft, etc., and perhaps offer me interest. These are the main reasons I put my money in a bank today. I'm not rich, but if I was, I'd certainly want most of my money - fiat or bitcoin - with someone more dependable than myself.

Can't a bank also loan people bitcoins, and charge interest?

With the government's permission, can't a bank continue to lend people more bitcoins than they actually hold in assets? Fractional reserve banking, I think this is called.

(You might be thinking no, they can't lend two people the same bitcoin, because bitcoins are unique. But remember, the same applies for bank notes. They still lend the same money to multiple people, because fiat money is fungible. Bitcoin is similarly fungible, isn't it?)

Is bitcoin really fixing the financial system?

Edit: In case I'm just a rambling idiot, and not making a lick of sense, instead answer this question: ""What are the consequences of banks accepting bitcoin deposits, allowing bitcoin transfers between banks that are later reconciled with true bitcoin transactions on the blockchain, and governments recognising the legitimacy of bitcoin?"""
"""What remains is an inflation rate in the 2% range.""


I always thought this was good for society?


If people know prices are always slowly going up, they spend their money. Products will be cheaper now than in a year, while their saving will be the same. It makes sense to spend.


This is good thing. If I'm a business owner of any sort, I need people to spend their money to live. It's how the economy operates. This is why governments try hard to maintain this optimal 2% (not-too-big, not-too-small) inflation rate.


In a situation of deflation, people will know that prices are going down. Why spend their money today, when they can spend it tomorrow and get more bang for their buck?! This leads to less spending. This hurts my business and the economy.


What I don't understand about Bitcoin, is it aims to create this undesirable effect. The value of Bitcoin compared to goods is constantly going up. Why would we ever spend it?


It seems like the end goal here looks like: 1% of the population hodling to a currency that isn't being spent. What good is that?"

Great post OP, I was thinking of making one similar and I wake up to find out you did it. Bitcoin and cryptos in general have been derailed, more people care about making a quick buck that using them as actual currencies to transact with. They're not supposed to be highly speculative stocks, generally speaking all cryptos at some point are supposed to become stable enough to be used as a day to day currency.
"Thank you for this!
Very informative"
"Excellent points. And because of this, I think this underlines one of the major points that is counter to Bitcoin Core's philosophy as a store of value: do we really need to store a $5 purchase for a cup of coffee on the blockchain?

And the answer is yes. Because Bitcoin is a digital currency to allow free trade, and thus should not be discriminating or favoring any transaction. A transaction is a transaction, no matter how big. When we get into the business of favoring one type of transaction over another simply because of its size or value, then there has to be some group or organization that dictate what is and what isn't a valid transaction to store on the blockchain. Or we have to set standards to what gets put on the blockchain, and those can change radically and invalidate portions of the blockchain. 

The point is, it creates a centralized point of control or failure and that is totally counter to the idea of unmitigated free trade. And this whole issue is taken off the table when all transactions are treated equally."
">When it was tried to launch a private currency backed by precious metals (Liberty dollar), this initiative was shut down because it undermined the U.S. currency system. Apparently, a currency alternative could only thrive if “nobody” launched it and if they was no central point of failure.

Gona argue this one with you.  The problem with the Liberty Reserve product was that  it was deceptive and moderately fraudulent.  A big part of the underlying story was to convince people that his silver rounds were equivalent to (IIRC) originally $10, then $20 or 50, in USD notes.  And a lot of people were drawn in on the prospect of being able to pass his silver at a markup as a scam.

Nobody would have a problem with him if he said ""It's an ounce of silver"" and encouraged participants to price their goods in ounces of silver.  Or if he made his own currency which could float freely against the USD.  ""It's the Happy Silver Dingleberry, backed by an ounce of silver and with its own exchange rate.""  But the whole thing was clearly designed with the hope people would use his coins and notes at par with the USD, rather than at par with their silver value.

The ultimate sin of this scheme was that he started to debase his own psuedocurrency.  The first ones, as I said, were an ounce of silver denominated at $10; later ones were at $20 or more.  It completely undermines the narrative of ""it's a real asset and can't be manipulated to cause inflation."""
my focus was on the ability to allow people to transact, anyone in the world, with anyone else, without a govt being able to stop the update on the ledger ...
">So, if you find yourself religiously checking some cryptocurrency’s price

For me this feels like the only chance I have of a retirement despite these banker fucks.

I am not saying that people shouldn't invest on bitcoin (in my country(turkey) lots of people is investing on USD and EURO like others invest on property/real estate or gold so its okay to invest on a currency imo) but it is Mostly used as just an investment tool instead of a currency. This is sad I wish that companies and business would start using bitcoin more.
The reason it is no longer preaching to the choir, is because we have turned btc into a commodity, and have completely neglected it's use-value ie. as an object to facilitate the trading of goods and services.
"EXACTLY! Bitcoin is unfortunately seen as an invesment like stocks by various people and when you think about it its nowhere near being a currency because lots and lots of people are in this for financial profit and there isn't that much use of it as an alternative to USD besides some very small scale transactions and dark web drug vendors (and similar stuff) so its like gold ; mostly an investment platform and this is sad because Bitcoin had to be some kind of a revolution to our life and financial system.

Great breakdown of why Bitcoin exists. Couldn't agree more.
Everybody can decide for himself if he wants to own bitcoin. Nobody is forcing you. That it increases in value helps people to want it.

"OK, interesting. I found this on Wikipedia:

""The minting of Liberty dollars also appears to be in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 486:

Whoever, except as authorized by law, makes or utters or passes, or attempts to utter or pass, any coins of gold or silver or other metal, or alloys of metals, intended for use as current money, whether in the resemblance of coins of the United States or of foreign countries, or of original design, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.""

""Attorney for the Western District of North Carolina, Anne M. Tompkins, described the Liberty Dollar as ""a unique form of domestic terrorism"" that is trying ""to undermine the legitimate currency of this country"".[29] The Justice Department press release quotes her as saying: ""While these forms of anti-government activities do not involve violence, they are every bit as insidious and represent a clear and present danger to the economic stability of this country.""[29]""

"There are some difference with bitcoin:

1. You don't need a bank to transfer bitcoin over a large distance. You can only transfer cash face to face.

2. You can't ""print"" and lend bitcoin out of thin air. That is double spending.

3. Final question: That is similar to the idea of Lightning Network, which will be easier to implement after Segwit activate. The consequences are we get a much better currency than fiat (Segwit or not), banks and goverments have to adapt or risk falling behind. **Virtual currency will move on, with or without their recognization**.

Thank you for the excellent post.
This should be pinned. The choir is busy rap battling.
"A note on your first couple of points: 
For the majority of human history, virtual credit has been the norm, and not physical money. Coinage wasn't introduced until the late ancient age, around the time of classical Greece. Before that time, and much later in other parts of the world, people didn't carry gold and silver to the market. They kept tabs of different kinds of credit with each other. This has also been true after the fall of Rome, and all through the middle ages. Coinage and physical money was the exception, not the norm. 

For an interesting take on the history of money and credit, you should check out 'Debt: the first 5000 years', by David Graeber."
Excellent points. The thing is: bank money is so much more convenient than cash. Cash can hardly be used to buy stuff on the internet. If cash could be transported through the internet, the position of banks would be much weaker. Enter cryptocurrency.
"That may be why Bitcoin exist now, but nothing of that was the reason Satoshi created Bitcoin in the first place. Speculators took his invention, and changed it to this 'investment' scheme Bitcoin is today.


>What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party.  

This is why Bitcoin was created. (Bitcoin white paper, it's nice to read it from time to time.)
"
Thanks, I know, but I left this out on purpose to simplify things a bit. I think the main points are not negated by it.
"I read Graebers book and what you say is correct.

It's interesting to note that physical money or commodity-backed money tends to be used when there's not a lot of trust. Like when trade exandend beyond the boundaries of some tribe where ""debt record-keeping by everyone remembering"" just wouldn't work so well.

So the less trust there is among economic actors, the more sense commodity-backed money makes. And what is the place actors trust each others the least? Yes, exactly: the internet.

Hence Bitcoin: the trustless money of the internet, where noone trusts anyone else, so everyone needs sound money.
"
"Close but no cigar. Coinage was introduced at least as early as the Mesopantian epoch, going back to at least 2150 BC during the Akkadian rule; later Hammurabi himself designated a workman's salary to be the equivalent of 10 shekels (coinage) per year. 

http://www.ishtartv.com/en/articles_images/articles_image120110811204549TXs3.jpg

""Prices varied according to quality, place and time and were expressed in shekel. For example, date-palm groves at Nippur were worth about one shekel of silver (about one – quarter of an ounce) per sar (116 square feet); a healthy male slave cost about eleven shekels, an ass, five gur of barley (Roux 1964). Moreover, private money lenders made fortunes from short-term loans. ""

"Great post. I think it's important to ask yourself how much different is the blocksteam vision of Bitcoin ""banks"" or hosted wallet which you use to transact and clear payments than both original gold standard system which the banks and gov't co-opted as well as the liberty dollar that was mentioned. 

Why should we expect trusting banks with our money to work *this* time which it clearly didn't in the past?"
The CPI excludes basically everything that is effected by inflation. It is a scam.

Hi jstolfi! I don't think it was naive to create a disinflationary currency. It was created with gold as an example, also a disinflationary currency. Worked fine for thousands of years. I agree that Satoshi needed some headline as a timestamp but I don't think the headline was chosen randomly. He could have used any line. But he chose this one.
Thank you! My comment trying to explain Satoshi was focused on payment system got -8 points, and someone told me to stop sniffing glu. How will they react on this nicely explained comment of yours...
this is exactly what blockstream and the core developers want. the alternative is no banks, no blockstream, no core devs, big blocks, and cheap on chain tx fees.

"Rather than speculating, try posting a source, like I did. I posted a source for a 1nm transistor. In the face of that evidence, are you still aiming to claim Moore's Law is dead? 

Not sure how you aim to retain credibility with that strategy.

It doesn't, and rather than Wikipedia try reading Moore himself. 
Learn to read. Moore's Law concerns transistor density and held true for decades (not really any more). Bandwidth doesn't scale linearly with transistor density. 
huh?
"Anyone with basic knowledge of EE knows what Moore said. Sorry if I'm unwilling to waste time pasting links and posting on a sub where I'm severely throttled. 

Keep up the dumb narrative that bandwidth somehow has to double every year and that this is related to Moore somehow. "
The paragraph I pasted from the wiki clearly tells how it applies to more than just transistors so I'm not sure how to respond when you are blatantly dismissing what I have already said. 
"Ok let me get this straight. People said Moore's Law was dead at 5nm. 

http://newscenter.lbl.gov/2016/10/06/smallest-transistor-1-nm-gate/

There is now a 1nm transistor. Source is Berkeley, very reputable right? I use this as evidence to say Moore's Law is not dead.

It will never have segwit because it's only designed to preserve asicboost advantage by tricking new people into thinking software upgrade are bad.  It will have no decent developers. It's just a last ditch effort for jihan to make money off the hardware he built.  You guys are holding bags for someone that held up Bitcoin a very long time just so he could make more money. 
Doubleplusgood BCS is newspeak for BTC.
I call it bitcoin crash. Does that mean I have to get into political shit?

Legacy Bitcoin was Version 0.3.1 which had no blocksize limit.
It's btc
"Oh ok  
Wouldn't it be like, LBC or something in that case?"
What the hell is legacy bitcoin? You mean bitcoin core? BTC? 
I think we found where the 'too-crazy-for-the-crazies' line is being drawn.
Yeah that innovation already exists it's called bigger blocks lol
"Use the tiniest piece of shit that's only one of few too use this abbreviation to PASSIVE AGGRESSIVELY try and call it out.  

What a big bitch in real life.  If you have to go passive aggressive on the internet... you have no hope at the real world."
"The issue is right now that I can exactly predict when BCH will experience another drop. i.e. The next block. It's like clockwork. 

Sell now. Buy back later when it's cheaper. Just good sense. "
u/stupidx just proved to me over PM, by cryptographically signing a message, that he has a not-small number of coins (BTC).
The risks and benefits of segwit are hotly debated, and there is a lot of scepticism that it will have any appreciable scaling benefit any time soon. And even if we get 2MB there's still no clear scaling roadmap beyond that. 
Everythin except the ability to scale. It also has a banking cartel trojan horse in its codebase now, with patents. 
My main concern is that transaction fees need to be as low as possible, preferably close to zero. How do we get there? 
Holy astroturfing batman! Where in the bitcoin cash paper did it say designed for asicboost? Nowhere. 
"First of all Asicboost is a scapegoat that has no real meaning in this debate. Second of all Jihan doesn't even support BCC, he runs Segwit2x, so this post is just pointless. 

You do nothing but spread FUD so I already don't want to talk to you."

BTC-e trollbox meme
It's a tired meme that people can't get over. 
[Because memes.](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=375643.0)
Some say its short for **H**old **O**n for **D**ear **L**ife.
Someone got drunk on bitcointalk.org and said something impassioned about how they should all hodl their coins or whatever. 
Waaaaay back someone made a thread regarding holding and mispelled it. It became a meme.
Yes, they mean Bcore.
Until some lawsuit happens sooner or later, that's billions of dollars fraud involved if the post-fork coin is sold to customer as pre-fork coin
What? You get hyper sensitive because shortened Bitcoin Cash as BCash?
Easy there turbo.  No need to get your panties in a wad. His opinion matters here just as much as yours.  And you need to look up what passive/aggressive means, as PoliticalDissidents comment was in no means passive-aggressive.   His comment was a clear statement of fact, regardless of how you interpreted it with your own agenda.  Furthermore, just because you want something to happen real bad to serve your own interests, doesn't mean it will happen.  
I ask myself that all the time. 
BCash is the name that the trolls are trying to get people to use for Bitcoin Cash. 
now that is sound math. especially (only) because the other coin was free.
I agree with that.

"I should have qualified that statement. I just mean that the btc rise can't solely​ be from users selling bch to buy back  btc, _and_ likewise users selling their existing btc to buy bch.

The price rise definitely could be attributed to people selling bch and rebuying btc, as long as the dumped bch was bought with fiat, or proceeds from other alt sales. 


Edit:

Meaning if you restrict trading to just users swapping existing btc and bch, it's a closed system and net value would have to remain constant. Net value didn't remain constant, so influence outside the strict swapping of existing pairs had to drive that. 

Correct me if I'm made a mistake "
What is BCash?
"I'm assuming you got downvoted for calling Bitcoin Cash ""BCash""."
"You're not a bitcoiner if you think there are 2 sides to the scaling debate. There is only one.

The capacity increase is happening if you want it or not, it hasn't happened yet, 2X is just the first HF,  (most useful idiots think it is segwit for some reason)

there is a contingency plan with BitcoinCash, if BS/Core Blocks the capacity increase, or we cant fork from 2MB fast enough (the economic bug being the transaction limit, could kill the main chain very fast.) 

The only solution now is to remove the capacity limit or die. If you can't see it you will learn the hard way. if you think you are smart bet on the winning side, if you have one grain of doubt Hodl both chains and wait it's going to be unbelievable. BS/Core will do more than 1 fork to try prevent what is now inevitable - central planing in action.

BitCoinCash"
Well, they propably lost a lot of money seeing what happend tonight. But shouldn't feel happy about that they took a chance and it's not turned out well (so far, tomorrow might be different).
Pretty sure it was always clear as day which side (at least in the BCH/BTC debate) was right from the start. What else would you of expected to happen by hard forking without the backing of a large sum of miners?
Tripping balls on BSCore Kool-Aid, eh?!
Seek treatment for your brainwashing.
This is the most retarded comment of the day.
Potatoes potatos.. thanks luck to you definitely need it more then me as of now 
"You mean on Reddit? It would seem that, having /btc and /bitcoin is pretty dumb tbh.
"
No it's not. Bitcash has its own community now. Bitcoin does too. 
The community means nothing because it's easily maniuplated with sybil. The market is harder to manipulate, and it shows much less of a split that people would have you believe.
BCore and your consensus. Can't have that with all the censorship, chum. 
">So go ahead and Buy the Dip yourself; but I think its incredibly reckless of you to suggest that to others. How would you feel if someone invests their last $1000 in BCash only for it to Crash down to $5-$10

That's not even a hypothetical. Well, I don't know if anyone invested their last $1000 but people are investing money in this... get out now people. It's time to sell. Before it's too late."
2nd best is a reach
"It's about merit and nothing more:

- More transactions per second
- Reliable zero confirmation transactions
- Developers do not want to push transactions to second layers

Bitcoin's advantage is the network effect and use of censorship to shape public opinion."
Well, you're entitled to your opinion and that's fine. Thanks for the good wishes.
I wouldn't say second best because technically it performs better than BTC. The problem is it doesn't have the miner support, big blockers should have just forked when we had 40% of hashrate.
I think a lot of traders may have retreated to private wallets in preparation for the August 1 chaos, but it's likely a combination of a lot of reasons that resulted in a perfect storm with low liquidity and high volatility.
Very plausible.
I did just that, but hopefully people here will continue to do the opposite. 
Ok good thought but tulips? Who are you professor Mark t Williams? Bitcoin is now mostly used as a investment. When the right innovations come in to play and more adoption then will it be possible to use as a payment system in the meantime have pAtience young one lighting network is coming ! And one more thing UASF segwit ! 
You can send $100mil worth of Iota for no fee
I think that's true for the majority of altcoins. Of course there are tradeoffs like lower liquidity, but transactions are basically universally cheaper and faster.
"Please like i said I'd rather have a $10000 dollAr coin with real value then a Bcash China coin all day. With "" $10 tx fees"" innovations will come and remove ""$10 tx fees "" patience young grSshopper just like this time we had to be patience to activate segwit !"
It's generally understood that in investing it is prudent to buy low and sell high. Bitcoin Cash currently enjoys being the only alt coin to have actually forked from the block chain, bringing with it all the characteristics of bitcoin with the ability to have larger blocks on-chain. Ether is inflationary and lite coin has segwit, so i don't know why you would choose that as a diversification from bitcoin with segwit.
Shilllllll

I know right. These r/btc losers can't even put their money where their mouth is. lmao
"Well we didn't all know how the fork would work. If it would work or how smoothly it would be.

The fact is, I have read through the white paper for bitcoin, I have discussed and thought about the complexities of bitcoin with coworkers and on Reddit and I simply want to see the scaling of bitcoin happen. If either solution works then great, both? Fucking awesome too! None? Well now we've tried two maybe three ideas, what else can we try with our combined experience? 

While both failing seems unlikely i feel it's worth noting I haven't taken a side per se, I just understand and see the value in one implementation of scaling versus the other. I am happy to be wrong, I've been wrong a lot in life but you won't ever find me not hodling onto some piece of this action."
Not everyone thinks the same thing you dumb fuck. Im holding on both chains, because im not retarded enough to think i can guess the future.
"you're here..

you are they"
"My point is the opposite. This sub does and currently is celebrating BTC

Hence the fucking title of this thread "
"> This is a big block sub

That's too bad. I liked when this sub was open to discuss all things related to Bitcoin, even the merits if any, of big block alternatives. This sub was response to the censorship of rbitcoin. A big block only echo chamber does the community no good. "
Nah. It's just an anti /r/Bitcoin sub which made it easy to pump BCH on. That's just others exploiting the partisanship of those who are gullible for profit.
"Bitcoin cash is also bitcoin so it's probably calling the forked version ""bcash"" and implying that it isn't bitcoin that is causing people to call you a blockstream shill... "
"Well, Segwit doesn't really help with the scaling and we'll see if 2x will happen at all (Blockstream doesn't seem to want it happen).

In the end the problem is the hashrate that is just not there for Cash, the fork should have happened much sooner."

No that's not what I meant.
Y'all were played by bullshit. Truth hurts huh.
Everybody already has SegWit enabled wallets and exchanges.  They have been sitting waiting for the FUD to die down for years.  SegWit will be rcoking in two weeks.  
I'm not a trader. Im a hodler so naturally hodl was what I did.Bcash is probably going to be partnering up with Onecoin soon lol😂 Waiting for that pump 😂
Thanks outo correct fixed. Lightning is the next innovation of mAny to come !
Who cares. I'm here for uncensored Bitcoin discussions. Yes I prefer Bitcoin Cash, but apparently that's a minority. So be it.  
No, you absolute twat. You're a paid liar or an idiot. 
True, but bitcash is an altcoin now, so they have their own community. 
I need to get to the bottom of this, give me a sentence that will get censored in r/bitcoin and I will write it there because I don't truly believe they are censoring, I have been discussing freely and never been censored over there.

Idk those answers but if you do some research there's plenty of answers... lighting is not the only innovation that we have for scaling or is it ready. Segwit is our first salcaling.. but but but I thought BU was the Best and for sure to be implemented lol r/btc were the minority the community doesn't matter lol
One of your kind I have dealt with you all through this past year with the blocksize debate and you guys were adamant that BU was going to be adopted adamant as hell but were so so so wrong. And that segwit will never be implemented. I hate to say it but your one of those guys adamant but yet so so so wrong.. innovations to come lighting network is just one !
I get it definitely understand were your coming from! But the truth of it is that the majority of the community stands by Bitcoin majority not even a discussion now! And I just happen to be on the majority of the community were you are in the minority. So simple that the community has spoken and this direction is in the Best of interest for all of us and the scaling will begin with segwit. Not long at all a couple of weeks. Afterwards lighting network and other innovations to follow with the backing of the majority of community wich are users of course! 
Who has a payment system that is threatening BTC? Lightning is already working in alpha...SegWit + Lightning = payment system. If you do not like Lightning on chain is there....
There's plenty of things that were designed for use case X, but ended up being better at use case Y, and ended up succeeding because of Y (or even Z).
Agree, but the payment part of it doesn't need to be super cheap or instant, for bitcoin to retain its core value. that's my point.
"Bitcoin price hit the ATH, not bitcoins crypto marketshare.
Bitcoin transactions won't increase anymore either."
"The free market isn't siding with BTC, it is siding with the word Bitcoin.  If BCC (BCH) was called just bitcoin,  the ""free market"" would side with that.  Bitcoin is a brand now, not just a bunch of technological feats."
Your welcome to unsubscribe anytime. And saying the market has decided anything about bch is laughably premature.
"They've been trying for almost three years at this point. In fact, what was by the far the most thorough test ever for big blocks in BTC was done by an operator of a small 750kwhr mining farm located in the USA. He forked testnet using his own resources to do so and ran analysis that showed, back in 2015, that 3-4MB blocksizes would have been safe at that time. He never asked for donations, had no corporate backing, and whatever mining power and setup time it took to do this was all out of his own pocket. 

Blockstream has $76million in funding with huge corporate backing and the best they could do is have Luke-jr knowingly lie about the speed at which internet bandwidth is increasing and then write a single page analysis with zero testing about how we should lower the blocksize limit down to 300kb based on his previously stated false projection. Then the co-founders and executives at Blockstream write thousands of posts about how ""unsafe"" bigger blocks will be based on them essentially doing no work in testing or developing them.

Big blockers are completely welcome to work with Blockstream and Core so long as they never even think about bringing up the topic of increasing the blocksize limit until Blockstream says it is allowed."
"> BCH has no business support

None as in zero? Or none as in a blocksize limit increase of ""none"" is the only safe option now?"
"> If Core have any say in it, we don't. Core believe we need high fees to ensure mining remains economically viable long into the future

You know that Bitcoin ^(Cash) is backed by the largest mining manufacturer, right?"
Does it matter? If it keeps getting easier to mine eventually it will get easy enough for my GPU setup to begin mining profitably again and a lot more retail miners can jump in the game picking up the slack.

I was there, buddy.
Ah so like a backronym. Thank you for your kindness toward a newcomer, everyone. 
Time. its actually an illusion. 
you wouldn't mind sourcing then?
It wont be automatically easier to mine if there is less blockreward. Yes it will be easier because miner will stop mining and difficulty will drop. If you can mine with a GPU again that will mean that the chain is as secure as grandmas cookie box.
I have not seen any businesses or payment processors that are accepting BCH or planning on it. Since BTC has such support they would all need a lot of time to prepare etc...
I'd say it's more to do with its long standing history of being secure. The word bitcoin is associated with that security, it's not like the name itself magically imbues things with value. 
Blockstream's Segwit wasn't implemented either, Segwit2X is a implementation by Jeff Garzik's team and it has Segwit+Hardfork.
"Its called ""Bitcoin Cash"" :) Good luck."
Why do we not have BU implemented? Oh I forgot blockstream tied everyone's hands so they couldn't implement it 😂
Yeah but in the mean time trading them for bitcoins then use my profits to get the lower price Bcash. Atleats that's the plan 
"Again, how was BU a failure if it had more hashrate than Segwit? 

Segwit on its one was never agreed upon, it's a compromise of Segwit + Hardfork, you should read up a bit."
">I know I'm just selling it now and buying it at a lower rate.

Good idea.  I bought some and will buy more when the bear trend shows signs of being over.  I expect it to go lower in the short term."
Lol can you guys admit you were wrong. BU was the failure UASF and segwit clear winners 
I know I'm just selling it now and buying it at a lower rate. I'm fully convinced in Bitcoin just like I have since I stumbled up on it nothing has changed other then an innovation to help it become the world currency. 
You mean 1 merchant, right? Details, details...
Sounds ok, except there is evidence for one and not for the other.
">Segwit is what bitcoin wanted

It's really not, a bunch of idiots on a filtered subreddit wanted it."
Yes. It's like Freedom Fries. Let them have their marginal memes.
bitcoin is 8 years old.  Bitcoin Cash is 4 days old.  And its not even being mined yet because the diff is adjusting.  But im not going to try to convince you.  I just hope you dont sell ALL of your BCC , just in case. 
"So uhh, didn't /r/btc send everyone to vote for Bitcoin Cash?

"""super cheap"" perhaps not , but it should at least be competitive.  but we'll see what the market wants.  i have no problem holding BTC and BCH and letting either or both make me rich."
Bitcoin is dead in the water because it isn't at an ATH in marketshare? You know bitcoins marketshare used to be 100% right? Or has it been dead since the first alt was born, since it's marketshare has been decling steadily since then?
Haha 1 guy doing it manually...my bad 1 business. 
"Some people have trouble understanding that all the ""complaints"" regarding censorship and such are truly mostly irrelevant now that there is a coin that follows our (Satoshi's) philosophy.

The Old Bitcoin can continue being feature-creeped to BlockStream's desire now, and I won't complain. I will, however, reserve the right to profit off of it as I see fit just like I do with other altcoins, some of which I fully understand to not any have realistic long-term outlooks."
ETH is a ticker for Ether  not an abbreviation. Much like how BCC/BCH are used as tickers for Bitcoin Cash/BCash. 
Because they made a poll in Twitter that was hijacked by Core.
"Damn.... even Trezor calling it Bcash:

I do.
The blockchain is meant to be a publicly visible ledger after all.
Prove it.
"Cool. We believe you. Thanks.
(And it doesn't really matter anyways...)"
"> Correct me if I'm made a mistake

*I've"
There has been a significant amount of BCH bought for cash, for those selling it this has given the sellers cash, its reasonable to expect some of that to be put into btc.
"Additionally, from Coinmarketcap, we have the following for the last 24 hrs

* BTC up 14% from $2,767 to $3,155 on $1.5B volume
* BCH down 34% from $374 to $247 on $0.2B volume

The volume alone says that there is more trading on BTC than BCH, so I agree that this jump in BTC is not due to swapping of BCH alone.

Besides, the total crypto market cap has increased by ~$7B. So, outside money is flowing into the system.

Bitcoin never ceases to amaze."
Thanks for the advice. I usually don't tAke financial advice from no one today might be that day I do. 
dude, don't hurt yourself, it's just reddit.
No it's not! FUD
Ok you want substance. Hodlers are the substance just like me there's mAny hodlers waiting when bitcoin becomes a payment system that you don't need to exchange bitcoin for fiat! Is that enough substance or do you need more?
It's odd how people are only now begining to moan about fundamentals now that there is an altcoin.  Previously you were all investing merrily into bitcoin.  Now it needs fundamentals.  Almost all crypto right now is speculation. We're starting to see a few places legally start to use crypto but that's pretty much neglible in the grand scheme of things.  Right now the whole thing is seen an investment vehicle to profit off of. 
"Not true at all. 

Being a payment system is a feature of bitcoin. It's main feature is that it is the gold standard of cryptocurrency. You can thereafter use your bitcoin to buy a whole lot of other cryptos with various features. There is, even today, a thriving underground black market - as long as things like drugs etc are illegal, bitcoin and other cryptos will have use. It is an easy way to conceal/secure your wealth. The biggest feature bitcoin has is the liquid market - hodlers create this liquid market - which allows bitcoin hodlers to buy more or cash out anytime with ease.

Instant payments with low tx fee is a desirable feature, and most hodlers believe it would be fixed in due course. Even if bitcoin never scales, sidechains will fix this problem and bitcoin would still have extremely strong fundamentals because of the reasons I have stated above. 

People on this sub severely underestimate the political benefits of bitcoin. "
"So? Discrediting this sub via unfounded accusation and generalization has been tried for more than a few days too.

Bitcoin core is dead in the water, couldnt care less if Bitcoin Cash takes over or Ether. Sound money wins :)"
"Ever heard the expression ""being the bigger man""? ;)"
Yes this is very true I can't say I haven't tried over the past year to try and get to some of you guys on r/btc to reconsider your stand on the blocksize debate. All I could do was try!
What it comes down to is the hard fork right? Haven't read much about it only the basics.
Ohh stfu, I'm pro-segwit but no need to rub it in.  Anytbing can change in the future, each side has their dicks don't be one of them.  I'm rooting for BTC but no need for spite or rubbing anything in.  I understand its heated and almost religious but we all want crypto's to succeed.
"> Come back to /r/Bitcoin and realize you've been lied to.

Funny how everybody on the small block side has always said we will need 12-18 months to ""deploy"" even a tiny 1MB blocksize increase, and that will only be possible after a year or more of thorough testing which Core and Blockstream, just by pure coincidence I'm sure, have both done basically none. Now, after merely three days of bigger blocks in the wild you're ready to call Bitcoin Cash a total failure, Roger a liar, and recommend that big blockers gravel at Blockstream Core's feet so that they might have a chance at being let back into their echochambers? Nice consistency you got there! /s"
Man I have no idea what you are talking about it's my 2nd day in this sub-reddit. Share some links so I know what you talk about.

Apparently Bitfinex are trolls too, since they call it Bcash on their deposit page: https://www.bitfinex.com/deposits/new/bcash

So.... Bitcoin. 
"This is the correct answer.

No promises. This is total chaos. BTC maximalist miners fucking with the hash rate, etc. 
Okay, so who will operate those third party projects and how will they be paid?
Bitcoin running core software will never become a global payment system. It will never support enough transactions per second to be more than a microcosm in the grand scheme of things. These are still the early days, Bitcoin wasn't made to be an internet curiosity, traded in exchanges for mainly speculative reasons, it was made to compete directly with the global financial system.
how long are you going to wait for that payment system is the question?  risky to wait while competition is payment system now.  thats a large part of big blocker agnst/impatience.  sorry if you dont get it.

Come back to Bitcoin and let's make it happen. This comment is directed to all former BCH supporters, not just you. Let's unite again and make Bitcoin great.
If Core have any say in it, we don't. Core believe we need high fees to ensure mining remains economically viable long into the future (when block rewards will be much smaller)
And who's gonna mine blocks if there is no blockreward left?
"Well Jihan has cited his own patent concerns publicly as a reason for not fully supporting Segwit, i.e. his Asicboost patent which would no longer be usable. Obviously he wants to protect his (extra) contribution to the network and you cannot fault him for that; What's bizarre is folks here that keep saying it plays no factor."
It is then considered a Pork Loin Sandwich. 
bone removed, and yes it is still a pork chop. 
No, it is Bitcoin talk forum post, you know the one everyone here hates so much because of theymos and bla bla bla...
Wrong. It stands for hold on for dear life. 
The reason for the 12 months was for businesses and wallets. BCH has no business support so the faster fork did not break anything. 
Bitcoin Segwit (BCS). Not difficult.
"Apologize for what? Lol I haven't mocked them just stating my thoughts. 

OH DEAR SIRS I am so sorry I have over 10 BTC in my wallet."
Don't be smug. No one can predict the market - including you.
"Nobody gives a fuck about transaction costs.

 They really aren't that bad anyway. Bitcoin is digital gold baby...not bitcash "
thats only if jihan wants to continue being a dick and starts spamming the network again in the name of bitmain profit.
Why would it happen? Asicboost fix decreases the chance of a few cooperating large miners spamming for free. Segwit increases capacity. Etc.
Can't wait for it to go to $10000 and 10 dollar per tx is fine with me! I'll take it! Then lightning network and other innovations. No worries. I still held to your China coins or BCH coins! For fun and giggles!
Nah. SEGWIT is gonna drop that.
Well, it'll be interesting to see how transaction fees adapt once Segwit is activated. 
The question is: is there a possibility that you'd pay more to send 1 BTC than 1 BCH is worth?
">I'm hodling both and drinking the good scotch tonight!

There may be hope for you yet "
I think it just favors working coin, BCH has a such uncertain future. Who knows, maybe this is the chance of lifetime if it takes off.
Confirmed since Bcash is dipping.
Litecoin to BTC is getting shit on. Bitcoin is dragging everything up.
Seems to me that the people who sold BCH @ $700 made the best trade. Or really, any sell before today has been better than holding. Not much time has passed though, so maybe I won't be right for long.
well then it's even better news for me, since you want my coins too
They are nemesis, like LTC and BTC!
.086 now. You missed 25% profit from trolling forums. 
BCC will either be worth nothing in a few months or split the community.
Ah, that was right when I bought. Good memories. 
Buy the dip 
">The bid side order books are so thin right now holy f*uck. Literally less than 2k BTC to $4400 on finex.

That would be the ASK side, not the bid side.

But yeah, the books are extremely thin in both directions these days... low liquidity just about everywhere."
BTC $3,300. Up $500 in 24 hours, which is twice the price of a single BCH :/ 
"Yes, while I probably converted more BTC to BCH than I should have, I did not use leverage.
"
Please dump BTC for BCH and leave. :D
Yea but when its not making new ATH's you are busy complaining and spreading fud. Then when it makes new ATH suddenly you are a hodler and  all is good.
Agreed but what does that do to the likelihood that BitcoinCash is going to get more hashpower behind it?
Or... This is just the market telling you lot that you are wrong and were holding Bitcoin back. 
Me too. I'm thinking to dump BCS for BCH just before BCH's difficulty readjusts
No guys, BCH is doomed
I believe in scarcity and disinflation and a 21 million limit I signed up for , so will continue to dump my b cash for BTC
Yo this side isn't fighting with you. We don't even see this as a battle.
Really, judging a win based on a week of data? have you been in the game long? remember how bitcoin has been dying for years now? I welcome the volatility either way. I know for a fact i'll be stocking up if BCH gets low enough. Come back in a couple of years once the dust settles down...
Well overall I am up about 15% so pretty good.  But I'm not in crypto for the short term anyway.  Been holding for a long time, will keep holding for a long time.
Abandon that 2x agreement and lose 45% of hash power that was signalling EC. Then come back and tell us.
Anyone who didn't think BCC would see this sort of volatility is lying or stupid. And to be honest, it feels fucking great seeing BCC going through its early growth pains. Your gloating is far too early, friend. 
We all win if we find a way to handle the needs of the user base of bitcoin. I consider both chains experimental right now. That is to say, they're both going through changes and it's hard to see exactly what will become of it with less than a week of data
LOL.
hahaha good question!
"I wish it were that simple!

This sub is really more like the dissident sub, which latches onto whatever the alternative du jour is (previously it was Bitcoin Classic, then Bitcoin Unlimited, now Bcash, though that is faltering even).  It's an ... interesting place.  You can tell what *not* to back by looking at what the shrillest, least logical voices on /r/btc are in favor of.

There is good discussion here sometimes though, which is why I sub.  You just have to ignore the people who can't be reasoned with at all."
I came here for this comment!!!! LOL!!
To be fair, this sub is called BTC, not BCC or BCH.
Not a good advice. Sold Bcash when it was at $700 and bougth Bitcoin. This is the best trade and won't be available ever again.
"This sub is actually about Bitcoin. Please read the sidebar.

> Welcome to /r/btc! Home of free and open bitcoin discussion, bitcoin news, and exclusive AMA (Ask Me Anything) interviews from top bitcoin industry leaders!

You don't have any coins, do you?
"I hold both coins, so this is a plus. Realize that the aggregate market cap of BTC + BCH is at an all time high right now. 

The real test comes when it's time for 2X. "
"Litecoin went from $4 to $44 in a few months with the activation of Segwit.

Obviously it is a different story with Bitcoin but there is potential."
It follows all forks of Bitcoin - anything that started with Satoshi's genesis block. Focus is on the forks with the most market share and hash power.
People are selling their BCH for BTC. The spike might be temporary. 
"Dont worry, soon enough everyone will be crying and all news outlets will be saying ""bitcoin is dead (again)"""
"> centralization have created their own altcoin

Do you mean that BCC (Bitcoin without Segwit and with bigger blocks) is more centralized? Can you explain how?"
Very true! I wonder how Jihan and Roger feel about their failed experiment and Fakeamoto aka Craig Wright  😂
Well then prepare for november. Another hf is comming in a form of 2x.
In my case yes. I won't use the BTC I put in cold storage because not sure how to deal with the split coins well. But I need BTC for buying the alts, so I just end up buying new BTC.
"The books are certainly thin everywhere, but I suspect this has more to do with increased confidence, SegWit, and a dramatic influx of ""free money"" for everyone dumping their Bitcash."
Let's not forget, we wouldn't have had cryptocurrencies had it not been for BTC.
"Most people is obviously waiting for the bottom to buy cheap coins. LOL at your concept of losing... Do you think there's not people making money out of shorts to buy later?

Clueless fanboys are clueless."
Bcash going into shit
Paging to u/adrian-X were you at bro your Bcash supporters need help 😂
So people are selling BCH (price going down) and buying BTC (price going up).  Once the dump slows, it could be an opportunity to sell BTC high and buy BCH low.
Will it continue rising or crash? If it reaches $4k I may consider cashing out as I need money IRL
I'm surprised the pump n dumpers let it go up like this tbh
Bitcoin is the honeybadger.
Makes perfect sense.  The uncertainty of the fork is over, BIP148 was a success, and segwit is around the corner.  The market has confidence, and those that want to encourage centralization have created their own altcoin.  Bitcoin's future looks fantastic.
Except bcash is going down.
Now its 5000 on gtr trading.
On our way to 4k before the end of 2017 
Quick thought about this one, could it be because a substantial amount of BTC was taken off exchanges and then not put back because everyone was concentrating on BCC, and now the amount of BTC has run out?
#HODL BOTH CHAINS YOU FUCKING SWINE!!!
Can't wait until $10+ per tx again if the mania continues.
3300+ at the time of writing...
"Where did everyone think the new ""free money"" would go after everyone cashed in?

I'm hodling both and drinking the good scotch tonight!"
Seems like the market favours segwit. Meanwhile BCH buyers getting completely rekted. Youve all been fooled by your own friends.
"Bitcoin Rising. +8% Litecoin Rising. +8%. Vertcoin Rising +5%

Pricing in Segwit ?"
Enough people sold their BCH for BTC to raise the price to where it would have been last month if the split didn't happen.

"> Whatever happens an increasing price is always good news.

Unless you want to buy"
" I'd suggest you hold your enthusiasm. It's just beginning of money flow from Bitcoin Cash to Bitcoin. I think it's to early to buy BCH, price not even go through 100$ for BCH, and it probably will go lower.

 This is expected, though, you can't just issue so much money from thin air in one day. BTC would not also sustain it's gains for long. It will drop down. 

 In long term bth and btc combined, would probably have bigger market cap combined then just btc without fork existing. But it will take time."
Go go 3.3k!
"At the same time ..

"Abysmal liquidity + fresh ""free money"" from Bitcash dumps + increased confidence in Bitcoin with SegWit = A Perfect Storm.

"
wololooooooooooo
So explain the two chains.  If I do nothing I have coins on both?
"I think this rise signals two things:

1. That hard forks really aren't that scary, even for a crypto as well-established as Bitcoin. I think uncertainty around this has depressed BTC prices for the past three years.
1.  The community has effectively split into two separate blockchains: those that want big blocks and those that want segwit. The market will decide which has more value, and it currently seems to be favoring BTC."
woo!
They were decreasing the amout in circulation how is that going?
How much do you guys think bitcoin will reach by the end of this year 
yes!
I'm getting price vertigo and thinking of dumping now and rebuying when it drops back to ~$2800
Finally some news about BTC and not BCH. I was confused for a while what this Reddit is all about.
[deleted]
Almost like the market is happy about segwit activating and bcash tanking.
"Yeah bitcheeeeeeeees 3100 USD on REAL Bitcoin! :D

+8% bonus for dumping BCash, wooo 3400 USSDDDDD.

Ok I'm going to take a dump."
Bitcoin to the moon! Dump your Shitcoin Cash.
No it didn't. Witcoin just jumped the shark.
Good for them.
# Why blockstream,core,axa, you do this and sabotage bitcoin and make it more valuable. Said Everyone at r/btc. 🤗
[deleted]
Do you still own btc? I thought everyone dumped their coins here
You can thank Roger for that.  He made such a fool of himeself with BCash that people realize it's a hopeless pump and dump that was created for political gain. 
"and bitcoin cash just broke uhhh...200? lmao
how does it feel to lose, r/btc?"
[deleted]
Where is bcash while this happening?
"i am sure Roger made a ton of money out of bch.

this price dump is blockstreams fault. this greedy bastards are making us all richer!"
This sub is rbtc, last time I checked BTC was the symbol Bitcoin was traded under 
Most people here hold alts
Wrong, it was the first, doesn't mean it would not have eventually happened otherwise.
[deleted]
"> Realize that the aggregate market cap of BTC + BCH is at an all time high right now.

Coincidentally, the same is true of the aggregate market cap of BTC + this booger I just dug out of my nose. ALL TIME HIGH!"
its the way to go, unless you have a time machine.... I hope nobody makes the wrong choice and gets majorly burnt. Cryptosphere is a very unforgiving place if you fuck up...
For a while there it was seeming like hash power didn't matter to people here. 
For starters, one Bcash miner has 70% of the entire hashrate of the network.
Just wait till november for 2x hf. 
Failed?
"Interesting, in which case I kind of expect to reach around ~$3,250 then break back down.

Edit: maybe $3,500"
The free money driving BTC price theory is flawed 
Lol, dumping your coins isn't going to make them disappear ya flog.

"well done selling at $700.. i thought i did well selling at $560

i put it into ether and xrp which i'm not disappointed about

btc rising way over $3000 was not expected at all"
Lol shows what little you know hahahaha
The entitlement of noobs is entertaining. We need more crashes. Won't take kind with these low volume rallies.
Don't believe anyone in here. 
Child stop. 
Segwit is only really effective at raising capacity once a big majority is using it, which won't happen instantly if ever.
LOL. 
I didn't. Well, I held some. But overall, don't fight the market. You're not going to win. 
[deleted]
I really should make a bot to say this, LN will not work with full blocks!
That is wholly unsustainable. Normal people cannot move normal amounts of money around for $10/tx. At that point I'd take a bank/venmo.
You can send $10k worth of digibyte for less than a penny and fully confirmed in around a minute...please... 
come on.. bytecoin is still hanging in there.. (it's like 10 for a cent though)
"how long do you think that will last where most value is speculative and people are not using it as a payment system?  That is what really worried me and why i'm real happy we have bitcoin cash.  even if it doesnt win its a great insurance policy against what looks very much like tulip bulbs... ""yeah we dont care if it costs more than paypal, price is up derp"""
and yet /r/btc top for the past month is all about how great BCH is over BTC and /r/bitcoin for the past month is about bitcoin news and shitting on bch.
This is a big block sub. Anyway, what's the symbol of the new Bitcoin offshoot? No one can agree it seems.
And you start calling it bitcoin cash, unless you want to get into political shit.
Don't be dumb. Stick to hodling.
It adjusted but not enough. (Should be about 1% of Bitcoin's)
Legacy Bitcoin
Bitcoin split into Bitcoin Segwit (BCS) and Bitcoin Cash (BCC) on 2017-08-01.
Seems like it would stand for Bitcoin Cash.
BCS means the coin after the fork, contains segwit. That coin is not the same as bitcoin before the fork, since it does not contain bitcoin cash
"OKEx prediction markets for BCash designated BTC as BCS tokens and BCash as BCC. Once the fork happened BCS became BTC and BCC remained. 

Edit: So I get downvoted for clarifying what  BCS is... "
BCS = BSettlement
a dumb attempt to attribute btc the status of an altcoin 
Bitcoin is doing fine.. you guys got what you wanted we got what we wanted no need for more drama November 18 everyone is happy!
Yet this is a bch sub
RemindMe! November 19th, 2017
*not sure if sarcasm or not*
how about 'bitcash'?
I expect Core and their supporters are willing to sacrifice short term profits in order to retain their stranglehold on bitcoin.
That would be if no other altcoins were available. Why would you diversify to Bcash which is clearly failing instead of Ether or Litecoin?
take that math to the bank, bud. you will not run out of bacon.
The more BTC price rises, the less interesting it becomes to mine BCH. Your altcoin was a stupid idea to begin with and it's becoming irrelevant very fast now.
"It seems that certain people are keen to exacerbate the divisions - provoking the rebel faction with trolling, and brigading posts and comments.

They scent blood and are keen to turn the current situation into an all out victory for their side.

Dangerous times ahead, dangerous times."
Falling in one direction isn't volitility. 
Well precisely we now know how the experiment has turned.
"Lmfao it was like a week ago everyone planning on dumping their BTC for BCC.

*SAVING FACE MODE ENGAGED*"
[deleted]
I agree with you some people say that it will go pass 5k not sure 
"It's coming in small number of weeks, too.  That'll demolish one of the few advantages that Bitcoin Cash claims to have had.  No wonder everyone is selling Bitcoin Cash now.  Its future is measured in weeks.

One interesting thing about this split is that it makes a block size hard fork increase on the main chain way harder to pull off.  People can simply point to Bitcoin Cash as an example of why not to do so, and say ""If you're in favor of it just go over there."""
By spamming the network you mean using it exactly as it was intended by paying for the chance for your transaction to be processed and put on the blockchain, then yes.
BCC/BCH/whatever we're calling it now also has no real dev support behind it.  That's what really worries me.  I've never heard of any of those guys before, and I don't trust them to keep the currency safe through the indefinite future.
im not complaining at all now that there is bitcoin cash.  may the best coin win.  may we all profit.
"> BCS

Let's not play vocabulary games, it just make conversation difficult."
When is the difficulty going to readjust? Or is it not a set time? 
[deleted]
Lmao that is a good thought considering he mentioned high tx fees of $10 lol😂
Guys stop trying to pretend it will happn, Bcash is being dumped
I have been thinking that as well, with this jump and BCH plummeting I should be able to afford a fair few. I've always been a hodler though.
I thought the difficulty already readjusted
What the h is bcs?
"It's pronounced **Bash** we are all in this together we're growing this thing called bitcoin. hang on tight.  

It's all working well just Hodl both chains. This pump is to move miners over to the BS/Core network. - what's going to happen in time (around November 18) is going to be a surprise. 

One result of this pump (we all love) is the BitcoinCash difficulty is going to drop more, and miners are not going to wast time attacking it. and the BS/Core difficulty is going up. 

we're all being manipulated only some of us can see it, and what's coming. everyone should hodl ;-) "
Thank you
As long as you have the private keys of the coins.
As if that will ever happen. It looks the other way round to me.
Correct. :)
"4.000 if I had to bet.

I think when Segwit gets activated it will shot up easily past 3.500.

November will be bumpy but if the community is responsible enough not to do stupid things it is possible that it reaches $4.000"
4K seems to be the general thought 
"When Segwit gets locked in it will go up. When it gets activated and the capacity of the network increases it will go even higher.
The problem may come in November but that's another story.
My point is: Bitcoin can go much higher and there are reasons to support it"
Sounds like a solid plan, maybe throw those earnings to BCC to diversify?

IT'S NOT CALLED BCASH!!! IT'S BCC OR BITCOIN CASH!!

Because stealing other project's names is what we do best, at our coin and our ""alterntive"" subreddit, run by same con-artist.

It's bitcoin cassssssh!!! Leave BCH alone!!! buhuhuhuhuhuuuuuu

"
"Consider this.

The more BTC appreciates in price, the more appealing it becomes to diversify into BCH.  The lower BCH goes, the more enticing it becomes to accumulate coins.

This should matter to the Core club, since their target market is speculators."
depends on level of fomo, but perhaps $5k
Maybe the forking business pushed many traders to take money of exchanges. Now the low liquidity allowed a huge price increase and speculative momentum does the rest.
Good now when segwit is implemented you don't have blockstream core to blame.
Bitcoin Connect?
The community is already split.
BCC won't split the community. BCC was a reaction to the community splitting (or being split maliciously). It's clear as day right now which side was right. You might want to make a new account and play nice on /r/Bitcoin. You should also probably apologize to core if you're still holding any Bitcoin.
"It already split the community. Good thing it only split off some of the vocal minority. I just hope they all talked with their wallets as well.

99+% of people who use Bitcoin couldn't care less about the probably less than 1% of people arguing on a few Bitcoin message boards thinking they know better for everyone. So people just look at BCH as free money, dump it and forget about it."
"I know that in Bitcoin this is often said; but this is not Bitcoin. This is just one of the hundreds (thousands?) of scam coins out there. I'm not necessarily saying its value will fall to $0; many scam coins have a non-zero exchange rate. But BCash will never be Bitcoin. It never had a chance. We are talking about a project so rushed they couldn't even do their due diligence to make sure BCC was not already taken. 

BCash is just capitalizing on discontent within the community. Some people want Bitcoin to have larger blocks; that's a fine desire; but this Fork is proving that you can't just go and implement what you want on Bitcoin without consensus. 

Just because some people want it; doesn't mean it is feasible to implement. There are plenty of other coins that transmit more data per second; with their own organic communities; their own hashing algorithms.

You can't hijack Bitcoin without consensus; and that is what this Fork is proving.

So go ahead and Buy the Dip yourself; but I think its incredibly reckless of you to suggest that to others. How would you feel if someone invests their last $1000 in BCash only for it to Crash down to $5-$10. 

BCash is insanely risky. It might have a chance of a comeback in a few months when difficulty adjusts if blocksize becomes a politically charged issue again. I wouldn't bet on it though. "
Any ideas why that might be? After-effects of people moving coins off exchanges to ensure they got BCC possibly, any other reasons?
"It's a fool's gold. I have no stake in these horses anymore because I sold my coins due to community split and uncertainties, needed the cash anyway. But Bitcoin Cash had no chance and I don't know why /r/btc had such euphoria for it. I see threads of people asking ""WTF"", which is comical to me because correction was coming soon. ""Buy the dip?"" Good luck man. It will always be second best to Bitcoin, just like Eth Classic. "
"The community is already split because of B cash . This is fine . We have different perspectives and should follow a different path if we desire
"
"Yeah, you win some, you lose some. I sold my BCH on Bittrex earlier for 0.79; from the time I started the transfer of BCH to the time I sold it dropped from 0.16 to 0.79 lol. Still, I think the next few days will be a volatile time, so may be easy way to increase my BTC holdings. "
Hold my bags :)
they compliment each other. 
"Hey, entirely possible! How long do you think we should wait before making a judgement? a couple of months enough? If your account even continues to exist by then...

RemindMe! 2 months."
Don't do it, bro. It's not a dip, it's a cliff.
"Nope! The Free Market is perfect and should decide everything in our day to day lives. We don't need any regulation or outside control, just the perfect machinations of capital. 

However, in this case the market is wrong. Let me explain what we need to do:

First we mine BCH as a charity to keep blocks moving, but not too much! We want difficulty to adjust so mining becomes profitable again. At that point free market economics will take over and BCH will moon, destroying Segwit coin on the way... any coin that has TRUE FREEDOM (as in market) will inevitably win. I believe in free market economics so I know this is true.

BRB locking myself in a dark room until BCH has all of BTC's market cap, plus the market cap of every other coin that wasn't FREE enough. I already sold all my BTC for BCH, so all I need to do now is wait, right?"
Get downvoted!
!RemindMe 1 year LOL 
I'd wait until it BCH rounds the bend and get's north of $300 again.
