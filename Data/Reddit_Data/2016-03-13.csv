The only constant is core holding bitcoin back through inaction, coercion and censorship. It's easy to conclude alterior motives.  Any reasons offered to support the delay in improving TX abilities have not been communicated well by core or its minister of information.  If that's a misperception then you have to ask why do so many have this perception? The road to hell is paved with good intentions - and that applies to all sides.  It's just hard to be agnostic when the methods core and r/bitcoin moderators have used throughly muddled the ability to have a civilized discussion.  Actions never occur in a vacuum and if it's hard to understand the sentiment shift then there is a deficiency in your overview. Or maybe this fracturing is intentional and backs are being patted for a job well done?

You just described Lightning Network:

A hard fork does nothing of the sort, *which is why there is one in your roadmap.*

However, locking up some percentage of the wealth stored in Bitcoin in another payment system and then transacting on that system very literally splits the ledger: there are all the transactions visible on the blockchain (one ledger) and then all of the transactions visible on Lightning Network (different ledger). Literally two different systems entirely.

It requires you to put in some up-front capital (1000 DASH, about 5k right now), but then you gain income without needing to run a huge mining cluster.

Gavin was trying to push through a hard limit increase for years. He was not waiting until the block size came up against the limit. He was trying to reach consensus with the other devs, but they were not communicating or agreeing to do anything, so finally, as time winded down, he went public.
Actually the argument has morphed into an opportunity to evolve from a single centralized development oligarchy to a decentralized free-market development ethos. This might have been a naturally occurring decision point, but Blockstream's efforts to maintain an outsize level of influence over protocol development has brought the issue to the fore.  Even considering all the potential harm to Bitcoin that would likely result from their influence, we should be thankful that they have pressed the issue to the extent that Bitcoin has this opportunity to evolve to a stronger and healthier development model.

This is different IMO. North Korea's state apparatus is comical in its evil.

It's also far more removed. It's unlikely there are many North Korean nationals reading these posts, for whom they would open old wounds.

It actually wouldn't, owing to the latter of those two.

The claim I was disagreeing with was far more expansive than blocksize limit related, however... and this is pretty material as classic appears moving forward with disabling [more](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/49v808/peter_todd_on_twitter_tldr_bitcoin_classic_is/) of the system's validation rules."

"As far as I understand, that ""500k limit"" was relatively nondeterministic, hence the hard fork in clients running the same version / code with different blockstores.  I will admit I haven't studied the specifics of this issue.  I was considering adding a disclaimer saying ""modulo the March 2013 fork"" in my initial comment, but didn't think it would be necessary for a good faith discussion of the original client.  I do agree with the 32 million byte limit, but again this was not necessarily intended as a feature of the design and was a consequence of implementation open to later change, and it remains a feature of Classic as well as Core.  Either way, it's incredibly pedantic and downright disingenuous to claim the hardfork bug as a blocksize limit, a fact of which you are well aware.  


I do agree that the change you linked is bunk, but it's a distraction for two reasons: firstly, it is not even merged yet and likely will never be merged, so I find it misleading and false to point to it as a ""direction Classic is moving"".  Secondly, it's not the issue at hand, and it has little to nothing to do with why anyone would choose to run Classic, or any of the rest of this controversy or discussion.  It also bears no relevance on my original claim that the genesis client would recognize a fork mined by a Classic client as valid.


So my point stands (and will be refined a bit for you to prevent nitpicking and pedantry): modulo the March 2013 forking bug, the genesis client *would* recognize a longest Bitcoin Classic chain as valid, at least to the extent it recognizes the current Core chain as valid.  Given that the key validity difference in the two chains is a rule that was added later to Core's consensus set, this makes Classic closer to the original implementation, design, and vision of the currency when it comes to the definition of a ""valid"" block.


Hope that clarifies for you."

2MB blocks are not currently valid under the existing rules.  In order to change this, all node operators need to upgrade their clients or the blockchain will split into two. Therefore it a vital we have strong consensus before making the change.  The change to 2MB can happen once it is done using a methodology respecting the need for strong consensus.

"> It worked like this:

No. It did not. Not even the first release, or the pre-release alpha implementation. No version of Bitcoin _ever_ has limited itself to just that behavior. Nor has even any altcoin that I'm aware of.

The behavior of Bitcoin has always been the first seen longest rule conforming chain is selected. Any blocks which violate the system rules are ignored as a first step, then the first longest one is chosen among them.  If you ignore the possibility of rule violating blocks (a reasonable simplification when discussing the algorithm, since excluding invalidity is trivial-- and in many cases fundamentally necessary for any further processing, then the above simplification would hold-- but the complete system does not make this simplification, has never made this simplification, and would be significantly less secure and viable if it did so.

Not for me, not anymore. Them throwing us a bone at this point is just insulting. Core / Blockstream needs to be ejected from a dominant position in bitcoin permanently.
The original and current design of the Bitcoin protocol is that the first longest _valid_ sequence of blocks is the preferred chain. The fact that nodes enforce the system's rules is an integral and inherent part of the design of the system. This aspect of the design is essential for upholding the incentives and security of the system.

Nobody cares about crowding out the mempool. If the mempool gets full, simply drop the lowest fee transactions. This will only affect affect users whose transaction fees are to low to be included in the next few blocks anyway.

> If blocks are 90% full at 1MB, you outbid 100Kb once every few seconds and the network is functionally dead.

Except for the 90% of the transactions that are included anyway, and the fact that you can still get your transaction in the next block by attaching a high enough transaction fee. Far from 'functionally dead' if you ask me."

The people care for on-chain transactions only, are you doing something about it? No. 

*“Blockstream is the first company extending the capabilities at the protocol level to support massive scaling of bitcoin and blockchain technology to a broad range of asset types. Put another way, the extension mechanism of sidechains, the company’s initial area of focus, allows any number of so far unthought of developments to happen in an open and interoperable way.""*

*""And that’s why I’m participating in this first-round financing as an individual investor, and why Blockstream itself will function similarly to the Mozilla Corporation. Here, our first interest is maintaining and enhancing Bitcoin’s strong open ecosystem. And the structure we’ve chosen will give us the freedom and flexibility to prioritize public good over returns to investors.""*

and what exactly does work?
">Large Financials / wall street / govt - the exact powerhouses bitcoin offered sanctuary from.  Blockstream sold core out ***sold bitcoin out***.  It's been co-opted

That appears to be the plain simple truth.

"> By the time they stop being scared or lazy to do anything about it, it will be too late.

Well, then, no problem; then they ""deserve"" what's coming based on the rules of free market capitalism.

(..as a trader I do not care; my shorting algos cover me. I'm happy as long as this thing doesn't go to 0, tho long before that I will cut all margin getting out while liquidity is still there then sell everything both hot and cold on spot to protect myself. For me it is about *value* both medium and long term; nothing else matters..)"
You sent a pm to the biggest troll of the classic camp, don't worry what he does/think, he's just a waste of time.

"This also gives you a good summary of the active proposals on the network right now.  http://dashvotetracker.com

And yes one of the proposals is salary for the dev team. Investors can revoke this salary at any time if they disagree with the current state of afairs.

"> I own sites too - what you do is borderline spam your site, repeatedly...I don't spam my sites.

Well, if you try to promote your pornographic sites in r/btc (even r/bitcoin for that matter, and yes, we know you have such) then that'd be spam, even if some of your fans requested you to share your latest and greatest. In the case of the nodecounter site, promoting it here or over there can not be spam, bearing in mind this is the place where the requests for the latest relevant graphs emanated from (I stand to be corrected on that last one).

The time for statements is over. Either they begin collaborating and work to get the 2MB hardfork code merged into Core, or Classic continues to gain influence and they continue to lose face.
Please try and come up with some rational arguments for why Classic is bad, instead of this nonsense you are currently spewing. 
Problems like this will keep happening until the community realizes the obvious truth, and that is I am the only one that is unbiased, fair, and rational. Truly the one person capable of leading bitcoin for the foreseeable future. It's been proven time and time again, I come on these forums nearly everyday and I see someone is wrong about something, it saddens me that I could correct all the problems if I simply had total control and everyones complete loyalty. Unfortunately Greed, and ego have polluted the minds of cryptoenthusiasts to the point they are blind to the truth and thus the road ahead will be full of peril and suffering. 
The money makes very little difference to their ability to stonewall IMHO.
">Gmaxwell was against hasty increases, and Peter Todd was engaged in ""1MB forever"" propaganda, but we can easily pull quotes indicating people were no were near their current positions 2-3 years ago.

And yet none of the other Core devs made moves to resolve the issue. It was only when Gavin pressed the issue, that their position hardened. The #bitcoin channel on IRC started becoming crazy in its single-mindedness against block size limit increases, sort of like /r/btc and its Blockstream conspiracy theories."
"Sociopaths and other dishonest leaders use cut outs to provide plausible deniability to their black operations. Bitcoin is in the middle of a war for it's very survival.  We can ill afford to make subtle distinctions.

A good leader understands that he must not only be truthful, he must be perceived as truthful.   ""Caesar's wife must be above suspicion."""
"Yeah, he wasn't rude or anything, and he approached me in a friendly way.

I just wanted to share it so it's not private. Too much private stuff happening in Bitcoin these days, especially surrounding this company."
"""Bitcoin presented an opportunity to develop a 'lightning network', but theres really not a lot of money to be made focusing on implementing it in bitcoin first..so we will get around to it sometime. We are really interested in leveraging this technology on alternative side chains for big business - like the too big to fail bailout recipients  - that's where we will make the big bucks,  we are in tight with those deep pockets now!.  In the meantime, everyone can suffer with small blocks, bitcoin is not as important anymore now that open source blockchains can be created by any company...and some big corporations have thrown us some benjis to develop some cool private shit for them. Satoshi gave us the foundation but fuck his vision we gun split off and start working on the side for the Keynesian mafia.""  Blockstream will make more money if there are several strong global chains to peg. So bitcoins cool and all but it's ok if we fuck up the entire perception of the community..we will make our money elsewhere..maybe a solid .gov contract! 

--that a fair interpretation? It's ""revenue generating elsewhere"" so bitcoin just isn't your pretty little baby to help grow big and strong anymore?  Yeah no fucking conflict of interest with core developers being blockstream developers.  Pass the torch already...you've pretty much admitted bitcoin has taken a backseat.  Let someone else drive before blockstream/core devs drive it off a cliff

If you are sincere about what is contained in the PM mentioned here, then making the same statements officially on behalf of blockstream will go a long way in laying to bed all the falsehoods that have been put at blockstream's door, and this debate can move forward. I can not guarantee that making such a statement will completely stop the bad PR coming your way, but my being in the bigger blocks camp makes me believe it'll placate a lot in the camp.
"There's not a sentence that's not a lie or twist or parroted FUD.

Look at the title of this post: ""asking me to remove"". Fucking lie!"
I think he means Bernie Sanders.  It's the only Bernie I can think of that fits his example of a rent seeker looking to squeeze too much and causing a backlash.  Or I could have misunderstood his point...
">I care that they're blockading progress.

I do too. This is why I strongly support a hard fork that takes control over the max block size out of their hands.

I only disagree with one aspect of your viewpoint, not all of it."
"> None of what you allege is proven to be true. It's an unsubstantiated allegation. What is substantiated: the funding they're providing for open source software that enriches the Bitcoin ecosystem, is good.
The fact is, Core had been stonewalling a max block size increase for years before Blockstream was founded. There is absolutely no evidence the founding of Blockstream had anything to do with the current empasse.

That doesn't mean anything to me. I see people and I see a problem. Whether they're an institution or not doesn't matter. They need to go."
"> The fact is, Core had been stonewalling a max block size increase for years before Blockstream was founded.

This is true. In that sense they were harming Bitcoin long before they had a $75 million war chest, and now that they do have it the damage they can do has been appropriately amplified."
"> Core had been stonewalling a max block size increase for years before Blockstream was founded.

That's not true. Gmaxwell was against hasty increases, and Peter Todd was engaged in ""1MB forever"" propaganda, but we can easily pull quotes indicating people were no were near their current positions 2-3 years ago.

Doesn't mean it's due to Blockstream, but their position has significantly hardened."
I'm glad to see that people still dish out downvotes whenever someone points out that a person who compares slightly overzealous mods to people committing genocide against their own people. Way to keep it real, guys.
"is bitcoin so dangerous for the finance cartels, that they dont allow to scale it up? looks like a successful move for me.

Believing in classic is believing in unscientific voodoo, conspiracy theories and faith healing. Get your act together if you think you're an independent thinker.
