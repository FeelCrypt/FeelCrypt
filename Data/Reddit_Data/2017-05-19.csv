I meant why are you a sub for people who support something you don't believe in? Seems like you could find better uses for your time if you're not interested in bitcoin. Yeah, you have a nice day too.
"5) The only safe way to achieve a healthy fee market is through centrally-planned quotas hard-coded into clients.

We can start to visualize a near innumerable chain of tenuous logic."
That's probably a little true, but only good up till a point.
"There are many desirable immutable properties it Bitcoin: mainly censorship resistance, a fixed, decreasing inflation schedule, and consensus-ruled governance structure.  However, technology progresses very quickly, as has Bitcoin, and it will be silly to suggest that no improvements can be made in the underlying technology, especially when many design decisions were made because they were simply ""good enough"" at that time, when the network was much smaller."
You're suggesting the price of bitcoin will crash? Gee, what could have possibly told you that?
"And to build on that point, immutability is important but not sufficient for BitCoin to have value.  In addition to certain immutable properties, what gives BitCoin its value is that its a medium of exchange that  has many advantages over existing options.  The only economic models I've found for BitCoin's fundamental value are based on flow of exchange: BitCoin needs to retain a certain price point in order to facilitate the transactions its being used for.  If BitCoin looses those useful properties as a medium of exchange, or alt coins out-compete BitCoin, I see no reason that Bitcoin will retain its value as the ""digital gold"" proponents seem to suggest."
"Agreed.  Now Google ""cbergmann response."""
"TSLA has capital, makes products that people buy, and often turns a profit in the process.  That's fundamental utility.

Fiat lets me trade for goods and services without the inefficiencies of bartering.  Plus, I can pay my taxes with it.  That's fundamental utility.

Satoshi described a currency that was uncensored, cheap, anonymous, and was free of centralized monetary policies.  That's fundamental value.

People can misjudge value, can fail to predict future events, and can create bubbles by chasing after rising prices, but price is always driven by fundamentals in the long run.  Using something without fundamental value as a ""store of value"" is a terrible idea."
"It is not true at all.

Hard to change the fundamental properties shouldn't equal to be unable to evolve or remove a blatant capacity limit."
"Yeah well, the stakes are quite a bit higher now, which would make the bar for ""good enough"" quite a bit higher too. Of course improvements can be made, but they should only be made if a suitable compromise can be reached among a consensus of individuals on the network."
"I appreciate and agree with your contributions in this discussion, but your use of ""BitCoin"" is very unusual and makes you look like a noob; I would encourage you to use the more standard ""Bitcoin"" (for the network in general) and ""bitcoin"" (for discussing amounts of the currency)."
Even if another coin overtakes the market cap of bitcoin, bitcoin will have the advantage in number of active users (by virtue of its notoriety and momentum -- most folks have never heard of bitcoin and even fewer have heard of any crypto besides bitcoin). Ask any social network or phone app and they'll tell you what a critically important figure this is.
"The problem is, it doesn't fit the definition of a Ponzi at all. I have also used the word Ponzi in such circumstances, but it is more sarcasm than formal criticism. A claim I can at least understand would be a pyramid scheme.

For this to be a pyramid scheme, it has to at least be a zero sum game. If there is utility, then I would argue that it is not. Whether ""digital gold"" or ""gold"" even has any utility is up to the reader.

I'd rather be on the safe side (ethically, if not opportunistically) and allocate my wealth towards a token system that has as many potential use cases as possible.
"
"Translation:  you own none and are butthurt that you missed out on getting filthy rich. 

Roger. "
ROFLMAO — it's as if you guys know it's a ponzi and just don't care
A change to the underlying technology of Bitcoin is, by definition, a fork.
They'll also tell you that first impressions are also extremely important.  Name recognition wont mean much if people's first experience using the bitcoin is crap.  It wouldn't take long for a much faster, cheaper alternative to gain wider adoption.
"Exchange wallets are centralized. Because the bitcoin in your exchange wallet is backed by the bitcoin on hand at the exchange, they don't need to make a transaction on the blockchain until you attempt to move your funds out of the wallet. Otherwise it's just changing numbers in a database.

I'm supposing that a large number of new users are using bitcoin as a speculative instrument and therefore wouldn't need to move funds out of the exchange wallet (I've seen people who work at Google do this. The tech savvy are not necessarily bitcoin savvy). And if they do, they'll learn if they want to keep their money. My first experiences with bitcoin weren't exactly smooth sailing and I'm still here."
"No, bitcoin's value proposition is long-term. In the short term, people may do stupid things with their money. As long as the exchanges play by the rules, the newcomers are none the wiser. And if they don't, it's a good thing there's plenty more exchanges to soften the blow.

I was just suggesting that the confirmation time issue may not be as offputting to new users as you might think."
"That's not how I read it. He doesn't advocate _against_ technological improvements at any point. He just says that at the point where technological improvements via forking become politically unfeasible, this may be the point to stop forking. Has the possibility of upgrading the technology without forking been examined? Or is it just dismissed as impossible, the way peer-to-peer electronic cash was before bitcoin was invented?

Maybe it is impossible, I'm no expert. But I'm definitely not a fan of false dichotomies."
What's bitcoin's long-term value proposition?  Why would it grow or retain its value if it can't compete as a medium of exchange?
Also, how does an exchange wallet get me around long confirmation times and high fees when I want to buy something with my bitcoin?
So, bitcoin's value proposition is that you can replace banks with uninsured exchanges? 
Immutability is insufficient for value.  When the market runs out of newcomers to racket up the price, the price will crash.
"""I am glad to see that Bitcoin has progressed to the point where hard forks are practically impossible.  I want to see the political contention within Bitcoin factions grow to the point where even soft forks are impossible.  We may already be there.""

-CBergmann

So, no, by Bergmann's philosophy, you cannot make improvements to the underlying technology."
I'm aware of that, but I can't buy things on an exchange.  You seem to have this impression that bitcoin's value is a long-term investment, that it'll keep going up in value (or at least not lose it).  What I'm trying to get at is, why would it?  What makes a digital currency that can't compete as a medium of exchange but has an inflated price due to hype any different than a ponzi scheme?
And we've reached an impasse. It's been fun playing.
It's still immutable and that makes it an excellent store of value. The longer it stays immutable the more trust people can place in it and the more value they'll be willing to store. Trust is a difficult thing to earn and can be shattered in an instant.
"What makes it different from a share of TSLA? People have been shorting the hell out of that stock for years, but the investors don't care. They see the long term value and the stock keeps hitting all time highs. It's much the same for bitcoin. Value is imaginary dude. Things are worth whatever people think they're worth, and the value of fundamental utility only comes into play when people stop thinking they're worth anything. Then somebody starts using the thing again because, oh wow, turns out it's useful!

The fee market will cease to matter if the price of bitcoin crashes, which may allow for some much-needed protocol upgrades to go through. Doesn't matter much to me, I'm looooong on bitcoin."
"First impression: I agree, hard forks are a terrible idea.

Final impression: Thanks for the suggestion, that was a good read. When I first came to bitcoin about a year ago I actually started off convinced that the block size needed to be increased. Even got lightly involved with a concerted effort to hard fork the bitcoin blockchain. Only after lurking both subs for months, reading innumerable articles and excerpts from the mailing list, and bringing in personal experience of how a professional software development project is run did I change my mind. It seems that the rub of the issue is that this is a high bar of understanding for many to cross before they can appreciate the arguments put forth in that response. Shit, most people can't even be arsed to read an employment contract."
"No it's not a Ponzi nor a pyramid scheme, but it sure has a lot of the hallmarks if them. Like for example:

In a pyramid scheme, if you extrapolate how the system will work in the far future you achieve ridiculous conclusions.  

Bitcoin? check.

In a pyramid scheme people are more interested in becoming involved to get rich than to actually provide some valuable good or service.

Bitcoin? check

In a pyramid scam people proselytise others to  join their ""cult"" and invest in the scam.

Bitcoin? check.

In a pyramid scam special vocabulary is used to try to convert the unbelievers, e.g. ""early adopter envy"" and a liberal use of the nauseating millennial expression ""FOMO.""

Bitcoin? check.

So in the end, I agree with you—it's not a pyramid scam.  But boy, you really need a microscope to be able to detect the difference."
And if there's a diehard user base who irrationally hodls their coins in the face of all adversity? And if new users are just using exchange wallets and not running into confirmation time issues?

Won't all the altcoins have the same scaling/security issues to solve?
except its hovering around $2000 USD/BTC lol
Is it crazy to suggest that bitcoin's resistance to change is actually a source of value? The fact that no one person or group can change the way it works makes it more resistant to attack, right?
No, because 4/5 people on Earth don't, and will never have, access to Venmo and PayPal or a bank account.

From a technical perspective, there is nothing whatsoever about Bitcoin that is even slightly interesting.  Have a nice day!

Dogecoin for lyfe. Shibe or die.
"Many alt coins already have significantly more capacity.

LTC - simply creates x4 as many blocks.
ETH - allows miners to increase or decrease the block size limit within a margin of ~0.0975% for each block they mine, so block size can grow with the capacity of the network.
etc.

The three main objection to increase block size are:

1) HF are dangerous

2) quadratic hashing

3) centralization


All three of these issues have proposed solutions, some of which have already been adopted by alt-coins.  However, there are so many impediments to change in the Bitcoin community right now, it will be difficult to get any of them to be adopted.  This is one advantage that alt coins do have, at the moment."

"No joke. I watched tons of videos on youtube about bitcoin before ever looking at the subreddit or into buying any.

Every video talked about how cheap it was to use, and how the goal was to become a currency.

Spoiler warning... those videos were all several years old. I was kinda depressed to learn the state of it now. Still hopeful for the future though especially in some of the ""altcoin"" projects."
"usb 3.0 enclousure included . and  obviously in 4 years an hd of that size will be laughable . 

blockstream core are really the luddites of crypto ."
and it's slower. 
Not all of it is stored in RAM.
"Emphasis on ""whole blockchain"" here. It's possible to broadcast a transaction when you have the complete UTXO set. You can run a pruned full node and trust noone without storing the full blockchain history."
Why do you put a space before your commas? It's very disconcerting.
"You can setup vswap, might to use cheaper cards/hdd's for that as the lifetime will go down, should still be enough for running a node.
Limit your local mempool will also do the trick, but its things you need to do because the backlog what wont be needed without for a long time..."
"Its not even needed, lightwight wallets are enough. Nodes in pruned nodes works as well.
And pruned nodes will never cost much at all."
Lightning network
Old nodes will still be able to validate transaction if signed non segwit and will not fork automatically.
Who says it needs to be sustainable? No solution is ever sustainable forever. Even BU has a 32 MB max. 
Don't compact blocks fix that?
Your nonsense starman argument is boring

"Where did ""Core"" say that? One thing, Core isn't an entity capable of saying anything, however I'd be curious to hear whether any Core developer actually said that. Do you have a source?"
"Even ""quadratic scaling"" is resolves by setting a maximum size for single transactions"
No, that sounds like a terrible idea, and if BU were to do that, it ACTUALLY would become an altcoin.
"A fork with 30% miner support and right to 4MB blocks would have a higher txn per second throughput than the 70% that stayed at 1MB.

Maths for the layz:  remaining mining power * current tx/sec * blocksize in MB = 0.7 * 4 * 1 = 2.8 tx/sec = new tx/sec. Meaning the small block backlog would grow and grow. 

New mining power * current tx/sec * block size in MB = 0.3 * 4 * 4 = 4.8 tx/sec 

4.8 tx/sec >> 2.8 tx/sec

The situation just gets better when difficulty adjusts or when mining power moves. But the 1MB is capped at 4 tx/sec while the 4MB blocks could reach 16 tx/sec

And 4.8 tx/sec is better than the 4 we had before the fork with only 30% of the hash power

Too bad I'm not a miner! :p"
"> Meanwhile, l support the Segwit UASF.

LOL. You support an anyone can spend minority fork. Great. "
The UTXO set database doesn't *need* to be stored in RAM like it is today. It can be stored in an SSD drive instead which is much cheaper and larger.
Uh no... Without a node your not guaranteed to be able to broadcast a transaction and with each transaction you leak a tiny bit of information about your wallet. If nodes where not important then scaling would not be an issue at all because block propagation and bandwidth would be a non-issue. May as well just use a database instead of a blockchain.
But segwit increases the bandwidth.  It can require 4 meg of data being sent for 1 meg of tx.  This is the big issue with segwit.  Imagine those 8meg blocks needing to send 32meg of data.
for bandwidth , see block compression and fast relay network / fiber / falcon . no, there's no real tech issues .
Any ordinary broadband internet connection can easily handle the range of block sizes being discussed for a node. 
But the Amish are not as sick as that psychopath u/luke-jr who has the desire to kill non-catholicist preachers. The Amish fled to America because the Lutherian fanatics killed them in Germany and Switzerland. An Amish even does not get baptized before he becomes a grown-up and is able to decide himself if he want to stay there or not. 
Yep and on an Raspberry Pi you can't just upgrade your RAM. Way easier to just plug in a new HDD.
"Lol, if you think that all a node does is download a single block every ten minutes, you need to go back to square one and learn about how bitcoin works.

Statements like this make it abundantly clear that you've never bothered to learn anything about bitcoin."
It would become a Bitcoin spinoff not an altcoin.
"I've been here since 2012, and owned gen 1 products from both bitmain and bitfury. I'm not a technical expert but I'm pretty capable. Your insults add no merit to your *absent* argument.

A lightweight/listening node does only need to download one block every 10 min, and thin/compact blocks helps aleviate any concerns over delay in getting the header data.

If a node intends to be fully functional (ie: uploading 5-10 the blocksize every 10min), then yes it limits how many can be productive uploaders. But that's the same for p2p file torrenting - often a small handful of seeds with extreme upload speeds (10MBps or greater) are responsible for hundreds of leeches who have little or no upload bandwidth. *last I checked the torrent system is working beautifully nonetheless, with massive files.

If the initial sync is your concern, there are ways to avoid it like trusted checkpoints and/or obtaining a partial blockchain from p2p torrents, and building from there.

Bandwidth isn't the issue"
His point is that a full node can act as a leech on the network (not propagating blocks but uploading *your transactions*) with very little bandwidth.
"> Only time will tell, it will be one hell of a movie.

At least here I can agree."
"Miners don't do nothing in that time they are mining an empty block while other miners are validating the block. It's to try and ensure that the miner mining the empty block get a slight advantage over the rest of the mining network while they are verifying blocks. Behaviour allowed by the protocol but considered a little dishonest.

There is a narrative being spun and we may both be wrong about peoples motives. Only time will tell, it will be one hell of a movie."
"Mining empty blocks does in no way cause blocks being more full. Please take a look into the details before you assume things. Mining on empty blocks is done while received blocks are validated. Otherwise miners would just do nothing in that time. It basically just adds an extra confirmation.

Its just another attempt to characterize chiners miners as somehow evil. It's sad that everyone just blindly follows this narrative and not questions the motives someone propagating this might have."
Funny coincidence that miners who want bigger blocks are mining empty blocks... Thing is there is a whole co-ordinated attack going on with bitcoin and there's a lot of fuckery going on. So long as everyone does their due diligence before picking a chain in case of a split and not just watching YT vids. And a large portion of core are from the cypherpunk movement and have been working on this problem for years so I can't imagine their intention is to destroy something they have spent 20 years creating.
Nothing new is known since then, no research shows that this path has flaws. It's just a very loud core team shouting that they - at all price - want to do it their way. Funny coincidence that this way also suits Blockstreams business model better..
Thing is it's a reasonable point of view but a lot more research has gone into the whole space and this quote is from before bitcoin was actually released and had much testing (especially real world attacks). There is nothing wrong with SPV but I'm not going to give up my financial privacy to make blocks bigger when I don't believe it is needed. Either way Satoshi released it the way he did so it's in the communities hands to ensure that it's being steered the right way so I guess we'll see how the incentives play out.
"Nope, it was always planned that only some are running full nodes..

> Long before the network gets anywhere near as large as that, it would be safe 
for users to use Simplified Payment Verification (section 8) to check for 
double spending, which only requires having the chain of block headers, or 
about 12KB per day. Only people trying to create new coins would need to run 
network nodes. At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the 
network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to 
specialists with server farms of specialized hardware. A server farm would 
only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with 
that one node.

 Satoshi Nakamoto"
But the whole design of bitcoin is meant to be 'I don't have to trust anybody in this system to ensure this transaction goes from A to B'. The whole game theory aspect is designed so that everyone should be acting in their own best interest. Removal of this feature would make the value plummet IMO. It may stay censorship resistant in the short term but longer term the system could be slowly be co-opted.
But it would always get noticed if one full node does not play by the rules because users wouldn't be able to use their bitcoins at places where honest full nodes are running. 
"I chose to address one of your points mostly because your point about bandwidth has been thoroughly and repeatedly debunked by now. Xtreme Thinblocks and even Compact Blocks have solved that issue ages ago. You're the one *changing the subject* instead of providing a counter argument to the argument I made about RAM needs. 

That's typical about you small blockers. As soon as we debunk one of your FUD points, you change the subject instead of making a counter argument. That's because you don't have any counter arguments. All you have are a few talking points and then when countered, you change the subject to the next talking point on your list."
The problem I see is that the whole ecosystem would not be agreeing on it, it would be the people running the nodes/miners which would become fewer and fewer (especially if we go to 8mb blocks). A certain level of trust is required from the nodes and as time goes on because people are priced out it lowers the resilience of the network and opens attack vectors.
"That's fair, and I don't disagree.

segwit is just as much much bandwidth burden as a blocksize increase, as the signature data still needs to be shared.

As for losing some nodes that can't support uploading bigger blocks, it's inevitable afaik, but a reasonable increase like 4mb (via segwit or hf) could still be handled today, and bandwidth improves worldwide every day so we could just as easily manage 8mb by 2025, maybe even 16mb.

There will always be a minority of nodes that have the bandwidth to support the vaster majority. Imo it would take 8mb+ blocksize today to actually damage the networks ability to propogate in a reasonable timeframe.

As much as it would be ideal that everyone is a full node with ample upload ratios, that's not the case and never will be. Accepting that, and recognising the ability of a small network of powerful nodes to supply the rest of the network, is a key part to bitcoin's growth I think, and was alluded to in the whitepaper as well (yes it's an old document now, but satoshi did forsee an unbalanced node system)"
Well the distinction matters to me because if Segwit activates on Bitcoin then I will support and buy the /r/btcfork Bitcoin spinoff coins because I'll consider that to be the new and actual Bitcoin. But I would not support and buy coins from any altcoin (ETH/ETC/LTC/etc). The UTXO history matters for at least that reason.
"Everything matters in science until prooven otherwise. I am not an expert in the field, but I generally do not trust such claims when they come from a side which is bypassing the discussions on the dev-mailing list and all other established procedures for discussions of BIPs, then forking the code and writing contentious, buggy Code.
 
And you dropped my point about the bandwith. Didn't go unnoticed. Typical behaviour for Big Blockers like you to cherry pick argumetns and drop others. See the OP, same behaviour."
Every user should be able to choose to run a full node, it's true. Any user who chooses to do so should also take on the requirement of having the resources to do so.
It's nice if everyone can run a full node.. but everything has it's price. This price is payed in form of adoption happening elsewhere. Also I don't buy the checkpoints require trust but downloading a genesis block not argument. If the whole world regularly (like every month) agrees on a checkpoint state (UTXO set + last blockhash) then how do you want to trick that?
LOL, weird autocorrect
"I made my point.  I probably didn't need to add the insult in.  So I'll back off that tactic.  But my point is that full nodes do indeed need to do more than just download a block every ten minutes.

Lightweight nodes (as you defined them) aren't useful to the network, just for the person running it.  I'm not concerned with these, nor should you be.

I want to protect bitcoin decentralization.  And for that to be protected, we need a robust distributed network of useful full nodes (one who allow many incoming connections).

Any increase in the blocksize will remove some useful full nodes from the network, as the bandwidth requirement will increase.  That's why I said the criticism is about bandiwdth, not disk space.  These useful nodes *need* at least a couple Mbit down/up connections.  Increasing the blocksize increases this requirement."
I'm a BU supporter but I think that's a distinction without a difference.
It will never become a majority chain because nobody transacts that shit. 
But it's fast enough for the speed difference to not matter.
That's true. So the claim that the amount of RAM available to a node is a bottleneck is untrue then, which was the point I was trying to make.
I'm not going to argue this point because your totally right but it's still a good idea to allow the user to store the entire blockchain if possible. It shouldn't be economically infeasible to run a full node since the less we have the more open the system is open to attack.
Please see https://bitcoincore.org/en/2016/06/07/compact-blocks-faq/#does-this-scale-bitcoin
Starman? That sounds cool. Not like all the other boring fallacies.
Here's some of the arguments documented https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Block_size_limit_controversy#Arguments_in_opposition_to_increasing_the_blocksize

"You need one person running a node. If people in the undeveloped country have internet, surely there's some sort of local data center or a single individual with realistic speeds 

Bandwidth is an idiotic argument that is luke-jr's favorite"
"If you now argue that the internet is not as developed in other countries then that is a invalid argument also.
Users can get a $1-5 VPS run a pruned node and connect with electrum or similar to their own nodes. If they want to run own nodes at least. 99.9% of users don't run nodes at all."
yep
[deleted]
I'm not sure anyone is arguing that storage costs are the issue.
"And not to forget about the african farmers with satellite internet connection.

It would clearly lead to centralization, if they cant run full nodes anymore."
"A 100kbps (bits) is more than enough to keep up, and download a 4mb block in well under a minute. Realistically, most people who host a *useful* node (ie: significant upload capabilities so they are more than just a leech) will have 10MBps (bytes) connection.

Bandwidth is a non issue

"
You are absolutely clueless about how bad internet connections are throughout some countries in Europe. Especially if you live in rural areas or in densely populated ones. There are tons of places in my country where 6mbit/1mbit speeds are the maximum that you can get. This is a fact, downvote me all you want, it wont change that. Its a fact that everyone who lives here knows, even from first hand experience sometimes.
"no it's not . after things like compact blocks and high speed relay network , core too said that bandwidth isn't relly the problem anymore . 

the "" real problem "" is always something elusive and not very well defined , depending on the conversation . obviously . "
Why would people with such limited resources want to run a node which can only validate transactions with extremely high fees that are more than they can earn in a week ? Stupid comment.
"The criticism is about bandwidth requirements for full nodes, not hard drive space.  Hard drive space has never been an issue since the concept of pruning.

But once again, this simple criticism seems to just blow right over your head."
And what about Initial Block Download time, what about validating new blocks fast? These aspects are not related to disk storage.
"yep ! with pruning the hardware resource become minimal , even for a full validating node . and block compression decrease bandwidth requirements . block commitments can negate the need to download all the blockchain and so cutting even the initial cold start time . and so on and on ... 

really there's no technical reason . and 1MB , already laughable , become more and more ridicolous as time passes . "
"blockstream core minions will always says it's about the other factors, whichever factor you are pointing out is not a problem . 

es . point out that 100-30Mbs cheap residential connection via so called 4.5G are becoming a widespread alternative for places not covered even by ADSL , and they say the problem is really the CPU . 

point out some cheap solution available , and the problem become the initial block download . 

and so on and on , until disk space come up again and the cicle restart . 

it's boring ."
"Meh. I'm sure before too long we'll have distributed blockchains with parity rebuilds. There's really not much need to have 50k copies of the blockchain out there.

There are 7000 nodes out there right now. The blockchain is 135GB. If there were 100 copies of the blockchain distributed between all the nodes, that would be about 2GB per node. "
But but but... the initial bootstrap time... /s
People using BTC in underdeveloped countries would not be able to verify their local transactions. If people are sending 3 dollars and less worth... not too many people are going to be running a $200 node with 0 incentives. 
"isn't Roger Ver a memory dealer? He could provide everyone who runs a BU node with several 32 GB sticks of RAM to store the ever growing UTXO set. And is there anybody here who can provide all of us with more bandwith?
Maybe Jihan could to that, because he linked to this thread on twitter. 

Meanwhile, l support the Segwit UASF. Don't build more carts when you can build cars. Lets try Lightening network."
Worth mentioning that the 8mb max-blocksize wouldn't be full for 5-10 years. The real blocksize would be about 1.5-2mb right now.
For the last time. It's not about space, space is cheap. It's about bandwidth. HDD space is ubiquitous, Bandwidth is not. 
i heard it's not about hard drive, it's about bandwith and RAM memory
I think the most important part is that bitcoin can fully work without anybody storing the whole blockchain.
I'm not defending small blocks, but I think the argument is bandwidth/speed issues on internet and propagation of blocks - not storage space.
It becomes harder for some of my nodes on low spec hardware. Running out of memory with the huge backlog...
We need to start setting a date for hard fork with or without majority. r/bigger_bitcoin is just for planning big blocks and doesn't allow debate over SW or not.
"Ram usage is higher with high mempools, bandwith also as the transactions still hits your node(s) And with huge backlog many transactions get even rebroadcasted when already pruned from your own mempool.
Bigger blocks makes the bandwith and RAM usage lower."
probably more like 1.1MB. It will take a few more years yet to reach 8MB. By then you could purchase a 16TB SSD for 100 bucks on eBay and broadband internet speed will be well into the gigabit/sec range.
Storage is not the not the issue...
In order to send your 3 dollars, you'd pay a 1 dollar fee currently because blocks are full.
It is clear that the technical reasons to oppose bigger blocks are false.  It is entirely business/strategic/economic/political.  
Please tell me more about how people in underdeveloped countries are sending $3 transactions with $1 fees.
Regardless of the HD how do you do a 2mb block without splitting the chain in two? 
We all know that by now. But what's the next step forward to bigger blocks?
How do you do a segwit block without splitting the chain in two?  Answer is you don't.  Even the segwit soft fork will split the chain.  The only difference is the nodes that are split off just won't know it and keep function thinking they weren't.  They won't be able to validate and the segwit nodes won't see them as valid nodes.
/r/bigger_bitcoin set up to discuss forking to bigger blocks
To remove the 1MB block limit. The only thing that needs to be done is for a majority of users , miners , exchanges to run a client with no blocks size limit. Once that happens , bitcoin is out of it's cage. 
"""Yeah but the real problem is ~~bandwidth~~ ~~validation~~ ~~utxoset~~ ~~bootstrapping~~ ~~incentives~~ ~~incentivizing a fee market~~ ~~centralization~~ fuck it just do whatever we say""."

@32MB you need 17.2 GB + ~2GB header data.
So even with 32 MB blocks you can use your 40 GB HDD from the year 2000 or just get some 32GB usb stick...

No one needs to keep the full chain for his own wallet and i prefer to do the initial syncing from nodes running in datacenters so I don't need to wait forever..."
"This is a silly argument. Bitcoin needs visa-level transaction throughput, bringing the block size to 8mb doesn't bring us there. To get visa-level tx we would need around 400mb blocks, which will need way bigger hard drives than that.

People are pushing for 8mb because they think (correctly) that this will increase the value of bitcoin in the short term. But to think that increasing the block size is serious a scaling solution is very misguided.

I'm not apposed to big blocks. Just putting the message out there that this isn't a scaling solution"
Blockstream should rename their Bitcoin Core client to Bitcoin [Amish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amish) and choose Luke-Jr as their true and legitimate Pope.
Since the foundation of Blockstream (2014), Bitcoin community was not peaceful any longer.
And the loss miners experience when blocks take longer to relay. That one is important, it is the reason we had a 6 block fork about a year ago- antpool wasn't validating some blocks because it was too expensive.
This. Storage space is always the least expensive resource.
Hard drive price isn't the main cost for fully validating users or miners.
Segwit actually needs to send more data than regular blocks.  
And politics, game theory, UTXO set and the killer in all this segwit is a blocksize increase that actually increases throughput as well as being backwards compatible. I get bigger blocks seem like the easiest way forward but it's not sustainable way of scaling and remaining decentralised. Everybody seems to think they know this technology but the reality of the situation is that there's a handful of people qualified to work on a $20+bn project and it's not Roger Ver.
"Ok - that might be the same difference though.  Say 8MB is needed, so then it will be used and we will have 8MB blocks.  I believe having a network that has proven stable at 1MB, should have 8MB blocks floating around in it.
I would say slow and steady - lets see how 2MB float around, then 3MB...and so on..."
