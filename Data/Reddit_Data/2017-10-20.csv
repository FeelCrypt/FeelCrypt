ETH price dropped significantly because hardfork wasn’t successful.
Though a pity it didn't result in free New coins. 
That was a dumb comment. Fork was 100% flawless.
I think etherparty is overhyped for some reason, also it was hacked. I prefer platforms with better support and security, like Confideal, don't you think?
No. I recommend you read *Debt: The First 5000 Years.*
"> The whole fuckin' point of a digital cash system is that it's backed by debt, not by any physical material in a vault.

So uh, ever heard of Proof of Work? Its backed by expending energy. Not debt, you cant back anything with debt, debt is just the threat of force to extract work.
"
"Well since you can't actually see the next 5000 years, the next best thing is knowing the last 5000. That book is actually the best ""justification"" for Bitcoin that I know of, much better than this POS thread. Actually goes into the nitty gritty of ideas like ""primordial debt"", the ""state theory"" of money, the famous ""barter myth"", etc.

The blockchain is in many ways the concept of ""money"" in it's purest, original form, which is why it might actually be around in 5000 years, not because physical gold is heavy, and other BS from OP."
"Oh. Thanks that clears it all up.
"
"Not when the thing it's pegged to is ALSO fluctuating wildly. 

Nothing has stable value because value is market/perception driven. It's a bit like asking if everyone in the world feels the same way about something every second of every day. It's simply not a property of our reality and I find expecting anything in our environment to have a steady and consistent value to be a bit naive.

Something is valuable because it has utility and is scarce. BTC has both of those properties and more to the point, even more so than Gold. "
The default format will change in the future (mBTC, etc).
"Lending doesn't require fractional reserve, no. But it does make it more efficient. If you had a world where all loans were backed by deposits, there would be far fewer loans. The multiplier varies by country but is generally between 10x and 100x of underlying deposits. When you look at the balance sheet it makes a lot more sense, it's all leverage (they're kinda borrowing against themselves to pay the loans). The inflation argument is a bit more nuanced than you make it out to be imo, because the central bank is the sole issuer of fed funds/esf they are the ones pulling the strings and that is magnified through the commercial banks.

You probably already know this but it's interesting to know that the money that banks call their asset isn't actually the same money that we give to them. Their assets are deposits at the fed in the form of 'fed funds' and what you see in your bank account is 'fake money' (fiat) that is backed by the central bank which issues it's own 'fake money' (exchange settlement/fed funds) to banks. The really mind-boggling thing imo isn't the commercial side but just how good the fed has gotten at controlling the money supply to hit their inflation and growth targets."
More interested in the next 5000 years, now that Bitcoin is here.
Sure.  Point stands.  
I like to talk about space yachts, because of the stock price or price of bitcoin goes to the moon, then what good is a regular yacht gonna do?
Yachts are more over the top and the preferred method of travel by the good folks over at r/wallstreetbets
Agreed! Good point.
A corollary from this: Bitcoin must be made as easy to transact with as possible, to prevent a similar fractional reserve takeover. Fiat defeated gold not because people wanted fiat more, but because gold was inconvenient, creating a demand for people to own them by proxy instead of directly, hence allowing fractional reserve. We must not allow that to happen, hence we must make bitcoin as easy to transact with as possible.
Crypto + WSB = Lambo Yacht?
credit, not money.
With everything going on now, I think we need this reminder more than ever!
"Hypothetically, let's assume gold is convenient.  One person may park his 1.0 gram gold to a bank and say 0.7 gram is for saving which the bank can not lend to others and 0.3 gram is for ""investment"" which he bears some credit risk of being wipeout and gain some interest in return otherwise.  Then I think the economy is ok with some monthly statement from the bank and random due diligence to check the existence of the 0.7 gram gold.

Therefore, I don't think the easy-transact is the cause of fractional reserve takeover.  I think the root cause is people forget what sound money is and fail to distinguish the 0.7 gram of money and the 0.3 gram of money and falsely think this person has 1.0 gram of money; they will still make the same mistake by the convenient gold."
"That argument is in favor of lending money; however, lending money does not require fractional reserve, it's a false equivalence. I have some cash in my pocket, I can literally draft up a contract and lend it to you for some interest (and take on the risk of default). And that was the function of banks in the beginning; p2p lending was cumbersome and difficult to research, so people entrusted an agent (banks) to do it more effectively. Banks later realized they have quite a bit of slack to lend out more than what they have when fiat was invented (first at banks, as credit notes), and that's how fractional reserve started. You really don't need fractional reserve to make use of sitting assets. To this day, some still believe banks only lend out the money they deposit...

The ""productivity"" argument is instead better suited as an argument for inflation, which will itself draw a lot hot debate in this sub. Fractional reserve right now is a means to get you inflation, albeit one that puts all the power and gains in the hands of bankers - a severely unjust situation in my view, no matter what your stand on inflation is. "
">you cant back anything with debt

Literally the foundation of all money ever."
"Yes, I agree, assuming that you have enough RAM memory.  However, even if you have a minimal amount of RAM you can still do verification and even with a slow disk.  You basically create a sequential file of all the UTXO transactions in order of time and then sort this by TXID.  Then go back and read the sorted TXIDs to make sure there are no double spends.  Then make one more pass over the block chain file to verify that all transactions balanced as to satoshis in and out.

Or if you want to verify randomly out of RAM and you can fit 1/N worth of the UTXO set you can do it with N passes to verify the double spends and one more pass to check the totals. (Obviously you can overlap this final pass.)  

There are many other possible ways to do this.  The main difference involved between doing off-line verification and running a node is that a node must verify in real-time and this precludes many optimization tricks.  (This discussion shows that it may be worthwhile to use separate code for initial node bootstrapping from that used to run once on line, as off-line algorithms can be more efficient, given certain hardware limitations.)

Assuming there are sufficient fast seeders for Bittorrent and that there are sufficient fast block sources, then the advantage of running a node while boostrapping comes from overlapping processing vs. network I/O.  Whether this is advantageous or not depends on the relative speed of network vs. local processing.  The maximum benefit of running a node occurs when the time to process is roughly the same as the time to download, giving appoximately a 2X speed up in real time.  If processing is much slower than bandwidth (or the oppposite) then there will be little penalty (ratio of times) for doing the Bittorrent approach.  As an example, if the local public library has a node and keeps a copy of the block chain, you could clone the necessary files at SATA speed and then you could take the disk(s) home and verify them at your leisure.

I like becoming richer :) I am a fan of the electronic cash vision and I would prefer it to the digital gold vision. I think the digital gold vision puts lower ceiling on Bitcoin's price compared to digital cash but I still think this ceiling is very high (say $30K compared to $50K for electronic cash). I also think that digital gold is great and gives us freedom from the government but electronic cash will give us more freedom. However I'd happily take what I get. I don't sell crypto, I only buy but my decision what to buy is based on which crypto is closer to becoming the defacto digital cash.
This is $6,000 and breaking $100,000,000,000 market cap though, which is pretty important.

Well, Free market, and hash rate, decided that... **yes**.

Who ever believed your propaganda ""we're going to moon""  ""buy now buy cheap"" at BCH 0.20, reduced his value over x3 times so far.

You might want to think why this keeps happening.

Damn core, right? 

Or maybe, just maybe:

* Roger lied to you guys about SegWit being ""poison pill"" there is absolutely no problem with it, especially it does not ""remove signatures"", it just ""sorts them into 2nd data-structure"", it is ""segregated witness"" not ""eliminated witness""

* Fake satoshi repeated that lie (or sold that lie to Roger, dunno who's crazy idea that was)

* Roger lied to you about his support for BCH, he certainly isn't buying it up now with all his millions

* The idea for big blocks is bad, because it means less and less people will run a full node

* The idea to not remove ASICBOOST is bad

* EDA is a bad idea

* Competing with Bitcoin on same PoW will not work. All altcoins learned that. Namecoin learned it the hard way and was dead for few months.

* You will not learn any of this in this echo-chamber / circle-jerk sub where you censored sub (downvote and then slowdown post rate so one can't reply even)

* You could learn all this all this and many smart technical info from Bitcoin Core, from whom you took their source code (big part on top of Satoshi's code, counting by features, besides SegWit too) or just talking to them instead of closig in own bubble

* Putting own destiny in hands of miners, instead of verifying blocks they maybe on own full node - is dumb

But nah, that all is just ""DAMN CORE!!"" fault, and you are all **being wise and smart** for buying low now. Totally.

"
The thing is BCH is simply another altcoin and as such it has to offer something much better than competitors. But honestly I don’t see why I should prefer BCH over Monero (for example) why? Because of problematic EDA or centralized ASIC mining?

That's not dying. That's the EDA. Unlike most around here, I find it useful in having allowed a viable price and payment mechanism for the switching miners to stay afloat with BCH. Come November 18, we'll find out what the market really thinks. 
"Bru, stop being so practical. :P

Completely agree with you. I trust that simple maths (fee of $0.05 vs $5+) brings people the right way, and that would be towards Bitcoin (cash), naturally.  

Ain't no third world nor thrifty students going to be doing much transacting and wealth generation with high fees."
"Nobody actually reputable have said ""a few months away"", it was only less than two months ago with SW that implementing it on top of Bitcoin actually became feasible. This also meant a huge uptick in the amount of dev ressources that are being put into it.

The point is, there is light at the end of the tunnel, even if the consensus layer of Bitcoin is hard to change. It is still the project with most of the dev talent directed at it. They just launched a desktop app for actual user testing a week ago:

http://blog.lightning.engineering/announcement/2017/10/12/test-blitz.html

Before SW I was worried too that scalability would continue to be at a deadlock. Now with SW, we are (even if it's slow) seeing a gradual throughput increase on-chain and the realistic implementation of LN and much more exciting stuff. 

If you keep buying into the bullshit misinformation about these technologies you will keep missing out on being part of it. If censorship on a subreddit and hatred towards a few devs ends up costing you that, that would be incredibly sad.

"YoungScholar89?  Not so young anymore, taking some time in high school, no?

"Wait wait wait. I was asking you what bitcoin is good for beside dumping your bag on greater fools but you don't know to avoid conspiracy theories? 

Am I understanding you right? "
"Hehe, yea. I was younger when I chose this account name. Young and dumb enough not to think it would be a bad username going forward - especially paired with a birth year ;)

Appropriate fee level depends on a few parameters:

* Tx size and 
* SW tx or not
* Confirmation time needed

A great source is:

https://bitcoinfees.21.co/

If you absolutely need to be in the next block you are going to pay for it. For a normal non-SW tx right now (let's say 400 bytes) I'd sent it with ~50 satoshi/byte or so equivilant to ~$1.2 at current prices, to be fairly certain of being included one of the next few blocks.

If I'm sending to an adress I own myself or the adress of a friend or family member I would do ~20-30 satoshi and expect it to clear in a reasonable time frame. I did as low as sub 10 sats/byte on Monday and was included in less than 20 minutes.

It all depends on the mempool, which have been bloated periodically but not been consistently bad since May/June, due to some obvious malicious spam txs (mempool history: https://core.jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#all).

"I don't subscribe to the ""AXA Blockstream Core"" bullshit. Framing your questions better will give you a quicker answer going forward, but I'll indulge you.

I'm fine with it being a store of value before becoming good for payments. Waiting for awesome new tech sure beats linearly scaling at the orders of a few CEOs trying to protect their business models.

It's fantastic to actually start seeing meaningful throughput increases due to SW. It's not a one day fix, but the patience is being rewarded and early adopters benefit mostly."
"I read that twice and got nowhere, quickly..

Maybe Bitcoin isn't for me."
"Ah that's excellent news!  There's been ""meaningful throughput increases due to SW""!

What fee can I expect to transfer money to Aunty Susan now?  I need to send her $10 to buy goodies."
Maybe so.
Yup, Bitcoin's value started with the two pizzas, grew with Bitpay's legwork to restaurants and etailers everywhere, and exploded with Overstock, Newegg, Dell and Microsoft. Now it seems like the same people who made housing and paintings trophies of the ultrarich are intent on doing the same to Bitcoin (that's assuming they're not doing a pump and dump to blow away the plebs first).

"Correct.

1) Dumb FOMO from people thinking they will get free coins, not realizing that is not the case with the SegWit chains unless emergency measures are in place for the losing chain. 

2) Whales banking on that dumb FOMO and easily manipulating emotional traders

I have to admit I vastly underestimated these forces. I've started to accept it is what it is, regardless of what I think personally of the current state of BTC tech, it is driving 50% of the market and has the best brand recognition. FOMO really could just keep driving BTC upward for years and making fundamentals irrelevant while the crypto market eats the fiat system. As long as you own any of the top 10 strongest coins you'll not be disappointed.  A rising tide raises all boats, for that we should all be thankful to be in this market so early on.

Because butthurt.  I genuinely feel bad for anyone that traded all their BTC for BCH. u/memorydealers doesn't have to worry though.  I bet he traded barely any BTC for BCH while his loyal followers got steamrolled.
the subreddit is r/btc, but ironically most posters are very anti-BTC, they support bitcoin cash, and obviously don't like seeing that BTC is shooting up in price and that bitcoin cash, well, isn't.
"Because there are already more than 5 of it and everyone that is the slightest mature is sick of these  ATH posts every 100$

The fundamentals have changed completely since then as well. Bitcoin is not nearly as niche, basically only being traded on a former magic card exchange. It's a world wide phenomenon with serious liquidity against dozens of national currencies. It's slowly becoming part of popular culture (Mr. Robot), getting daily news coverage from increasingly more mainstream media outlets and now slowly **real** institutional money.

UPVOTE PARTY 
THIS IS NOT THE REAL BITCOIN!
With 30% of the stack increasing 6x you are 80% ahead.
You should still be up in dollar terms. A profit is a profit.
When 60000$ ?!
Cool man. Just be sure to sell before the fork. 👌
BCH price holding *steady*.
"You guys really do come out of the woodwork. :D

Congrats on $6,000 Bitcoin, what a pity we aren't already at $10,000.  Such is life..

Blockstream, $70+ million

Twitter accounts, $1,000

Furious typers, $10,000

Bitcoin communication forums still censored, priceless.

Edit: Apologies if I'm off on the going rates. ;)"

"FOMO is bad because it's generally weak hands who succumb to it. Weak hands who get in for short term profit and who will likely panic sell at a loss when there is a correction.

If you're buying Bitcoin (Cash) at an ATH, make sure your hands are steady enough to hold for at least a year.

I tell everyone that my investment strategy is to sell at FOMO and but the FUD. Easier to say than to do, but probably one of the most valuable rule of thumbs if you want to avoid selling lows and buying highs.

Not really, I'm still having a hefty amount of   btc to dump on clueless noobs buying to wrong thing and I'm pretty sure it's more than you could ever afford :)
"Ah, the good ole ""fundamentals are different"" argument. I'm old enough to remember 1999 and 2007, there were a metric crapton of people saying the _exact_ same things you did.

Not saying that the fundamentals aren't different; they are. GBTC et. al. now exists to attract a lot more older folks who do not give two shits about the future of money, or central bank shenanigans, or financial freedom. But the peak of any hype always goes way, way over whatever the underlying fundamentals are, as we've seen repeatedly throughout history. "
"Not really. We are wise.  
Short term profit before a crash.  

Nah i'm good. I'll hold what I have.  "
Why are you so negative? You are like a bundle of negativity. You should do something relaxing. Get a massage. Go for a walk in the park. Light a scented candle.
why would you say that when the BCH price is holding, BCH?
FOMO is legit. I got in out of pure FOMO after being too lazy to get through the hoops needed to buy for 2 years although I believed in BTC since the start but thought the price would increase slowly. I got in at ~600 in the 2013 run. Hodled since then and even bought some more including ETH. If you get in because of FOMO just HODL :)
"Why should we sob about it? We don't care.

And bitfinex. Pah!"
Throwaway username checks out. Welcome.
There is a non-zero chance that SegWit2x is a great mess that pushes the price down due to slow and expensive transactions and confused users due to the lack of replay protection.
"In a free market society, things that are technically similiar can have completely different values. The technology and code of BTC and BCH is 99.99% the same. So the market is putting a 1200% premium on something that in GAAP would be labeled ""goodwill"". The market is saying the ""goodwill"" value of BTC is higher than BCH and that gap is widening. So something is fundamentally different in BTC that causes the mass public to put a greater value on it. This is what separates lead from gold. Metals that have similar characteristics, but completely different values.

You can close your eyes, or find out why the public sees more goodwill in BTC."
So did BTC when it crashed from $1200 to $400 and stayed there for months. Patience.
BTC brand is stronger than any technical decision in either direction.
This is true. I regret it took too goddamn long for the fork to happen. It should have happened in 2015.

"132 Comment karma. 21 Day old account.

Blockstream are going to run out of socks if they use them all to make sockpuppets."
"Man, all those posts in August and September from people that ""Made the switch"" and all the comments applauding them. They lost 60-70% of their BTC stack. 

Just search this subreddit ""all-in"""
Even I think that's a bit too abusive.
Not against BTC
Chillax. This is actually good news.
Ah, of course. The reason for Segwitters coin going up simply cannot be due to increase use and txs. It can only go up on hype and value props. SW1x = ponzicoin.
You should stop investing, you're clearly bad at it
