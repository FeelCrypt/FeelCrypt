Problem is how to define altcoin. One commonly used is a hardforked Bitcoin. So by that rule, you are not allowed to propose changes that need hardforks.
I don't have a stake in the game at all....Both sides are really annoying and hurting the community, if you ask me.  But, Roger Ver is so fucking whiny, childish and grating to the ear that I can't even stand to look at his face.  That's fine the little baby has excellent rage-quit skills in interviews.
That would make sense, but if you shit talk BCH it's not removed, also when you suggest Litecoin as a payment solution instead of BTC, it's ok ... it's ONLY when you talk about BCH and in a positive tone that an action is taken, so no, it's not because of the rules, it's specifically targeted.

 segwit funds will be up for grabs if that happens ... Segwit is never getting reversed
I didnt tell anything like that ! I only ask who control this twitter and i was ban. Roger isnot happy when someone ask question
Roger is king of doing the right thing the wrong way. He calls reddit a poorfag and offers them a bribe to take control over another community. Only Roger can make r/bitcoin look like the good guys.
What a sad little child.
"From the link which you apparently didn't read:
In the end, it is important to remember SegWit effectively nullifies AsicBoost completely. However, there are two different versions of this method, one of which is not easily detectable whatsoever. Without SegWit transactions in a block, any AsicBoost trickery will be effectively rejected by the Bitcoin network. However, pools could still mine empty blocks to oppose this scaling solution in its current form, since that has nothing to do with AsicBoost. It is an interesting situation, but it appears ASICBoost technology is no longer a threat.

"This is what I asked “On StockTwits where I have been active since its inception regarding the general stock market, I saw ripple trending and was quite shocked to be honest. What in the world was that token doing on my StockTwits trending app?  I decided to make a post trying to educate the “investors” that XRP is not a currency and the actual price is 3,428.57 USD (when you compare max supply to bitcoin’s 21 million) and simply appears as  .72 cents because of the 100 billion max supply.

A whole swath of people attacked me on the transaction speed and I refer them to the Lightening Network.  Where can we see verifiable proof of the LN working?

Can I setup two LN nodes and send BTC to myself to test it out? Has anyone done that?

"You're just spouting nonsense. Slush Pool became ASICBoost-compatible just a month ago, not two years ago. Saying that SegWit nullified ASICBoost but that it's still possible to use ASICBoost is cognitive dissonance. SegWit only stopped ""covert"" use of ASICBoost, not that it was ever really covert due to empty blocks being mined as a result. Now with SegWit, we have the exact same thing and even more pools are using the ASICBoost ""attack"". Slush is a huge supporter of Bitcoin. Why would they be attacking it anyway?"

">I don't think this applies to proposed forks that only take effect with a majority consent. 

No proposal has majority consent in the beginning. That is what public forums are for. To discuss ideas and try to engage consensus. If that is allowed, but fails, then the issue can simply be closed.

There was a funny interchange a while ago when someone wanted to raise a new BIP. He was denied on the ground that he should first discuss it on public forums. But he was denied from going that on /r/bitcoin."
This is incredible. 
The thing is we aren't all just looking at it like an investment so holding BTC is kinda hypocritical.   And from the investors standpoint It's also smart to invest in what you believe.  I sleep much better not holding onto any BTC.  
"No, it actually doesn't. 

Just because you don't like facing the uncomfortable truth that people here are spinesless when it comes to making hard decisions and shutting out the hate, vitriol and relentless multi-year-long trolling, does not make my comment spam. 

It's a visual representation of this community's failure to do what needed to be done. I called out the /r/bitcoin and miner Bullshit right at the very beginning, even after giving them plenty of time and the benefit of the doubt, but the vast majority here showed cowardice in the face of immeasurable evidence that Bitcoin as a network was already co-opted. Excuses, after excuse, chances to the point that the instigators considered large block supproters a laughing stock, and even after some of the best users/supporters/devs were driven out, still the n-th chances came in thick and fast, just like you are trying to brush aside my comment as spam.

That's why you call my comment spam, because you KNOW you all fucked up badly, and don't like to be reminded. This is also why I contribute so little here now, I know I'm surrounded by cowards that refuse to make the hard decisions when they need to be made, not when it's already to late to make a difference."
If this happens it will drag bch vs btc for years. We need censorship to kill btc sooner rather than later. 
Those seem to be treated as one and the same in this crowd.
Can this dude be a bigger cry-baby?
gee, i have tons.
Let’s see if that free speech works out here.... doubt it.
"Here's my TL;DR history:  I started out supporting Core and small blocks which I saw as a necessity.  I did a lot of math to back this, and eventually the math convinced me unequivocally that bigger blocks were better at least to gigabyte levels.  I began posting about this including detailed arguments for/against and about my change of heart and the math.

I found comments of mine being silently removed all of a sudden, which had never happened before.  I noticed this because they got no votes or few votes either way, and then I manually checked and found them removed.  The breaking point was when I made a comment that I put over an hour into that didn't say anything bad or rude or censorship-worthy and immediately checked and it wasn't there.  It got automodded.  (Reddit hides removed comments from you, you have to check them incognito or logged out to see what other people see).  A few hours later the comment went from 1 vote to 0 votes, and I checked again and it was still gone.  In other words, a moderator of the subreddit read my comment, disliked / downvoted it, and left it removed.

I was pretty pissed then.  Two weeks later I was banned for a nonsense reason and I began to read what was really going on all this time.  It still makes me livid to think about the manipulation that has gone on for so long and irreversibly damaged Bitcoin.  Regardless of everything else, Core's behavior manipulating opinions, lies, shitslinging and attacking everything they don't like disgusts me.  I haven't seen anything approaching the same bad behavior from the BCH community.  Or any other coin really.

"Agreed.  Although I think Roger has good intentions here, I feel like this just adds fuel to a situation where there is no clear end game.  
  
I would be much happier seeing us move away from all this hostility and focus on promoting BCH as a currency, educating people about the differences between BCH&BTC (and even other coins), and focus available capital into research, development, and incentives for adoption.  I feel like these are positive ways to improve our community, build relationships, and grow."
He would bribe someone if he was paying the moderator. He is not bribing here, because he is just asking Reddit, the company, to appoint a neutral moderator to the subreddit. Ver would not have control over this moderator.

"Create an account and say something positive about Bitcoin Cash.   Or say something respectful but constructively against Lightning Network and in favor of alternate scaling options for a few days.  See how long your account lasts.  

They ban people simply for disagreeing with the Blockstream business model.   Bitcoin has been coopted by a corporation, which can easily be proven by the fact that they refuse to even raise on-chain block size a little bit and nullify BCH's entire raison d'etre."
"You might consider looking up the words ""Literally"" and ""Possible"" up in the dictionary.  I literally think that it's possible that you are hurting your argument with your own words."
"I have been active in the Bitcoin community since 2011. When Theymos posted his infamous [""time for a break""](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3h9cq4/its_time_for_a_break_about_the_recent_mess/) post, the Bitcoin community was still very much using /r/bitcoin as a platform for debate and dialogue and lots of talking had been done about the scaling.

Theymos his message was very clear: ""I dictate this sub, my wish is law"" 

Sometime later I got banned for [this opinion.](https://i.imgur.com/73AwRNl.png) 

What is wrong about saying: Hey, I can't afford to use Bitcoin anymore because the fees are way to high for me. Why don't we make more room in the blocks so all transactions fit in there and there won't be a fee war? 

There is nothing wrong with that opinion. And there was nothing wrong with what I was saying. It's the truth. /r/bitcoin and bitcointalkforum and bitcoin.org, all have been under control of theymos and he abuses that power to make Bitcoin go the way that he wants. And we have seen the disastrous consequences of that. Ethereum was not build on top of Bitcoin, it all splintered in a to a million altcoins, the entire Bitcoin community got splintered up.

Theymos has mainly been responsible for that. He put an iron chokehold on the channels that he controls. Now the community has to get over that, regroup and build a community where this can not happen again, one guy taking control and hijacking the entire project.

  "
So you're complaining about censorship when you were reporting posts to be censored?
The former method has been tried and ignored.   The latter method is a last ditch effort to get individuals at Reddit to start confronting corruption.
Click the link in the video of Reddit’s CEO saying they aren’t a profitable company in an interview with Brian Armstrong.  Brian directly asked him to ban Theymos too.

Nah, ThePiachu used his powers to approve Dogecoin and Ripple posts.

He replied that ThePiachu had already approved those posts, and they couldn't do anything about it since he was the senior mod at the time.

The problem isn't that the censorship isn't proven. It's that it continues, and the users are unreachable because they don't know they're in a censored bubble. And after several years of this they have  such a huge majority of zombies that even in uncensored places it's hard to get objectivity (though they tend to unravel like mummies when faced with even minor questioning, ala Samson Mow).

The Core chain got irreversibly damaged anyway by segwit. So just let it go down, yes.. 
I DO care, that's why I converted it all to BitcoinCash.  That's the stuff I signed up for.  I don't just sit on my BCH, I spend it.  But yes, I care about my investment!  But unlike the core crowd I don't have to compromise my ethics to watch out for my investment.   
"It's better to have both chains be alternatives to one another. Then we can move away from joke/meme coins as Litecoin and Doge as backup and they can jokes for real or be more experimental.

I'd still like to see sub policies changed, but more than that we need a better medium for community discussion or at least lots of alternative subs."
Everyone knows they censor.  Paying to get the logs does nothing. They will not be shamed into changing. 
I agree. In Rogers defense I'd say r/Bitcoin is effectively probably breaking Reddit rules and this could be a reason to install a mod that knows what's happening on the inside.

"First logical answer. Glad to see some reason in here. Dont trust anything that has to do with the fight between r/btc and r/bitcoin.

Personally I dont jump into the slapfight since there is no reason to do that.

All it does is make two parties look even worse at the end.

One day r/btc wins, the other day its r/bitcoin. Dragging each other down doesnt help.

I believe in fighting thro implementation. Instead of wasting effort arguing, I use that time to reach out to people and let them know they should add an option for crypto to their store. And while they are at it, they should pick bitcoin cash for payments.

Simple stuff really."

The brigading that occurs if you mention bch negatively in another subreddit for example. Posts are reposted here for downvote brigades.

I check in here every now and again to see what the latest from Ver is, same way people check out what Trumps been up to. From my little visits here, its clear and blatant. I've never seen anything like  it from core or blockstream, in fact I don't think they have ever made such communications.

It should also be noted to newbies, that there is no real way to know who was behind those accounts.

I live in Sweden and yes I can move it for free inside EU and for around $30 internationally, excluding certain countries of course.
Really?  I run an import-export business and I do international wires all the time.  I have *never* paid as much as $100 for an international wire transfer.  My international wires through the banks cost less than USD 30.  From what experience are you claiming that the cost is > $100...?
Work for an investment firm, we waive all wire fees, especially for our large households. We have and will continue to do that domestically and internationally for no fee. No point risking a $40mil household over a trivial amount. So yeah, they can send a million abroad for $0.

Bitcoin was supposed to ""Bank the Unbanked"" and ""Give financial sovereignty to the poorest in the world by connecting them to a financial system that has shut them out due to its cost and requirements for permission"".

"The market adjusts with the rewards, so I think the transition should be pretty smooth in the end. Hype and price ""crashes"" might be a bigger obstacle. 

Let's play devil's advocate for a minute however;  If the rewards / fees are not enough at some point, worst case scenario is that there is ""hash drain"" that we can't mitigate the negative affects of by mere planning and business deals in a transition period and we can then either wait for the market to stabilize or fork to another algorithm. If we do the latter, an argument can be made that it is no longer ""Bitcoin""'. But at that point I wonder how relevant a name would be in comparison to a life saving fork.

"Having more than $1MM in assets is one thing.  Sending single transactions of $1MM is a different thing altogether.  The guy who used a $1MM transaction to justify a $100 tx fee is making a ridiculous argument.  Even millionaires will want to send transactions of ""only"" $1,000 every now and then, and paying a $100 tx fee or even a $50 tx fee for a $1,000 transfer would be ridiculous, and far more expensive than sending a bank ach, cashier's check or even a wire transfer."

you're confused. nobody is setting transaction fees. in your analogy what is fixed is rate of milk production.

no, security doesn't stay ""relatively the same"". miners dropping out means hasrate going down means security (cost of attack) going down.

in less than two years reward will be 6BTC. four years from that - 3BTC. before 2030 reward will be 1.5BTC. sure, some of the loss will be offset by price increase, but low rewards are not *decades* away. asset depreciation is a thing, what do you think is a profitable lifetime of a mining rig?

TRUE!
sooner or later?  You mean in 2140?  The idea is that Bitcoin would have world adoption at that point, meaning, there are bazillions of transactions and miners make plenty of money from tiny transaction fees for each of those bazillions of transactions.

Lol the fee market.  The block space is the market. As  you're charging people more just to get into the market, they deincentivized to use the market.   The fee market isn't a market.  It is a barrier to entry.   Say it with new now.  *Barrier* to entry.  
"You don't understand Bitcoin Cash's economic design _at all_ sorry.

Assume you are a milk delivery company for a small town. What is better for business and adoption of Bitcoin? 1) setting the price at $10 a litre so only a few rich people can afford to buy your milk but you make a small profit by selling at high prices to just a few people, or 2) Setting the price at $2 per litre but everyone in the town buys and drinks your milk because it's affordable and you still make a profit.

When block rewards drop due to halvings, if some miners can't make a profit anymore they drop off the network. No problem, the security stays relatively the same because it's still pricey to attack the network or gain a 51% advantage. Fees are not required by the miners to remain profitable until there is very little mining reward left (decades away). But then miners will make revenue by fees from _volume_. I.e. 10s of millions of transactions per day at 1 Satoshi per transaction. You know what the great thing will be though? Millions of places around the world accepting Bitcoin Cash for payments and everyone using it. Rather than the Coreons using BTC, they'll just have a few rich people using it and banks doing settlements on it. Nobody else will be able to accept it."
When blocks are full competition causes fees to rise exponentially until the currency is unusable. It's not sustainable.
That is the view point of many is the reason.

"I can’t speak for everything, but a decent example is when my little brother who lives in the US, flew to Amsterdam and ran out of euros, or USD to take to an exchange. For him to withdraw $400 while he was there, with the bank fees and exchange rate, would have cost him roughly $40 according to what he told me. Alternatively, he converted some of his BCH (which happens to be most of his holdings) to BTC, and withdrew it from a Bitcoin ATM, for about $1.50, again according to him. 

I do see western union advertised for 0.99 transactions, but in his case the boarders were going to cost drastically more money. "
BTC does not have a whitepaper as far as I am concerned. Satoshi's paper does not describe what BTC is now.
Totally agree. They are such losers.
confusion in the marketplace is to be expected.  BCH is a viable sound money that is easily workable to become the next worldwide reserve currency.

To me the whole thing looks like a stillborn."
Very true.  Still, I don't see how some people apparently think it's in their own interest to pay tx fees > $50 (or even $20) per tx as it was just a few months ago with BTC.  You are right, we should all do what is in our own interest, and the market will work.  Personally, I think it's in my interest to pay less than $0.10/tx, and I also think it's easier to promote a coin to new users when fees are that low.  The fact that low fees and fast confirmations make a coin more accessible to less affluent users is a bonus imho.
The remark only makes partial sense, in context of OPs previous remark about the poor. It wasn't created to be a socialist scheme. It was created to solve very specific problems of money and networking.
"This is a valid argument, I thought about it when I was typing it, but I think everyone gets the point, but it was directed towards the governments that restrict or seize funds, which I guess realistically is every government the more I think of it.

"You are telling us what Bitcoin was created to be. And we are telling you something else that Bitcoin was created to be.

Or a penny. 

That’s what cash is. Cash goes down to a penny.

Cash. Peer to peer. 

The intention is obvious.

Yes, your use case is also valid. 

But I think it would be ridiculous to claim that it’s the only use case, and is the “real” intended use case on a foundational level. 

Of course you can do layer two as well. Lightning network - - feel free. But to claim that bitcoin was not created as peer to peer cash for visa level transaction capacity of all sizes, is false. "

">why would you expect a currency that is 9 mo old, or 9 yrs old, depending on how you look at it, to be stable (in price)? 

I wouldn't, but that is something people tend to look for in a reserve currency.

>it's just a baby that has been attacked by opposing forces that want to preserve the status quo. of course adoption is limited for now. but the growth trajectory is clear; UP.

You mean more and more people will adopt it? Probably, although I don't know where the ceiling on that is. It's a new thing, which is great, but not only is it going to have to compete against existing and entrenched approaches, but it's going to have to compete against lots of other cryptocurrencies too.  In that context it isn't going to get close to where say the Canadian Dollar is in the context of reserves.

>and when you look at the technical capabilities and the economic fundamentals, BCH could easily become the next world reserve currency

How does it differentiate itself from any other cryptocurrency over that time scale (including ones not launched yet?). I don't disagree that there is potential, I disagree that it's likely at this point from the evidence available.

> there's no reason to think it can't, unless you can clearly articulate some viable objections. which i don't think you can.

How so? I agree it has been terrible months ago but the whole point is that they are trying a different scaling solution.

Tech progresses and Bitcoin might too, you don't know the future and neither does anyone else.

"I personally think volatility goes out to 2140 following the issuance curve. People are speculating  right now as the coins get issued, especially miners. This will flatten out and we're already seeing it. This pullback has not been in the 90% + pullback  like past ones because liquidity is getting better as adoption has grown. Stability will come.

I'm not worried about other crypto as they are just knock offs of Bitcoin and have nowhere near the network effect. Bitcoin  has all the right balance of features. "
There's only one major thing Core released in the past years - Segwit, and all the calls are made by Blockstream, so there isn't even any comparison. The weakest link in BTC is it's single centralized authority who calls all the shots.

">I personally think volatility goes out to 2140 following the issuance curve. 

I sort of agree, although there is still a question about how much of the value is utility driven and how much is speculation. The big issue is the classic one when it comes to currency, how do you ensure circulation when the real world value of a currency appreciates.. Why spend it, if not spending it means you will be able to spend more later.

Liquidity is sort of getting better, transaction times are still a problem, adoption is still fairly niche so there are barriers. None are insurmountable, or built in to crypto after all.

>I'm not worried about other crypto as they are just knock offs of Bitcoin and have nowhere near the network effect. Bivins has all the right balance of features.

If someone cracks usability, transaction speed, and gets corporate buy in, it'll be a killer, doubly so if it doesn't come close to seeing the sort of massive price increases that we've seen with some other coins.."
That's not what you **just** did .   Anyways have a good day.  
You're twisting the narrative here quite a bit.  Until you can admit that you childishly attacked me rather than the argument, and apologize for it, I'm going to refuse to have a conversation with you.  
">BCH is a viable sound money that is easily workable to become the next worldwide reserve currency.

It's not stable and it's not widely convertible so not really. About the only thing it ticks the boxes on are that it's free from direct government intervention and that there aren't any capital controls.  There is no chance it'll become a reserve currency any time soon (so.. within the next decade..).

And while confusion in the marketplace is to be expected, it has a negative impact. Just for context, taking the largest numbers I can find suggests that there are about 12m active bitcoin users (the lowest bound on that is 3m) that's nowhere near mass adoption for a currency. "
"Mining rewards will decrease by the size in bitcoin units or fractions of a unit, but the value of bitcoin will most certainly be astronomically higher in the future than it is today, thus still incentivizing miners.

"why would you expect a currency that is 9 mo old, or 9 yrs old, depending on how you look at it, to be stable (in price)?  it's just a baby that has been attacked by opposing forces that want to preserve the status quo.  of course adoption is limited for now.  but the growth trajectory is clear; UP.  and when you look at the technical capabilities and the economic fundamentals, BCH could easily become the next world reserve currency.  there's no reason to think it can't, unless you can clearly articulate some viable objections.  which i don't think you can."
Yeah, governments target slight inflation because it encourages spending, innovation, economic activity.. whereas deflation encourages hoarding..
erm, ok, what does that have to do with anything?
"> You need to brush up on reading my friend.

How so?"
The block rewards are still getting smaller even if they will continue for a long time. Probably fees will be a more substantial part of miners income for every block reward halving. The end game is still that transctions pay for themself, even if we hopefully have lots of transactions with small fees rather than the opposite.
"Over 99% of all Bitcoin will have been mined by ca 2035. The block reward for blocks 6720000 - 6930000 (last blocks that will have a mining reward, expected to be mined in 2136-2140) will be a single Satoshi.

Mining rewards will decrease faster than you realise. Talking about the year 2140 in any such context is nonsense"

Here is the issue, none blockchain has proven to be able to do it *while not compromising other factors* Point being, all blockchains are in early stages, and non are perfect for global adoption at levels higher of VISA.

"I actually don't own any crypto except for a little bit of ETH to test apps with.  I want to keep my perspective as unbiased as possible.  That's not to say i'm without bias.

It's not what you know that gets you.  It's what you think you know that just ain't so.  "
It's not a fee market.  That's not what a market is.   It's the barrier of entry due to artificially limiting the block space.   
You’ll get downvoted, but you’re the one actually making sense here. The volume offsetting low fees argument is about the only thing anyone has responded to you that makes some sense. On the rest, they just don’t get it. But I guess that shouldn’t be surprising at this point.
Yes... Are you explaining the point I made for me?
"Even better argument. 

Ultimately, the point is though, that currency is to be spent- that’s the entire philosophy behind it. It is an agreed term that can be used to transfer ownership, regardless of what item the ownership is, even if it’s just money. All of that being said, the ones who view scalability issues and fees as “it was not designed to be a charity” technically, sure you’re correct. I don’t remember reading in the white paper that Bitcoin’s goal is to be a charity. But it wasn’t meant to be held onto for dear life, it was designed to be SPENT just like other things we spend our FIAT on, without the trusted parties inbetween. SN didn’t say “buy bitcoin and hodl foreverzzzz!” or anything of that nature. Sure, you wanna save some of it? Go for it, people do that with Fiat too, however, it is ultimately to be spent. Whether it’s a savings for college, retirement, rainy day, or you just wanna save some money, one way or another you’ll spend it eventually somewhere, or give it away. This was never a money making plan, and again although a $100 fee on a million dollar transfer is a bargain, that’s not the fucking point behind it. I’d say they need to look outside the box, but they put themselves in that box in the first place and I can’t see them leaving it anytime soon. Sorry for the incredibly unorganized rant."
"Uhhhhh yes it does, I replied to a ""perspective"" post. Fool"
Satoshi intended *any* amount to be transferred easily.  Have you read the white paper? 
Yet there are BILLIONS of people in the world.
Thanks.  It’s motivated by about 4 years and tons of identical comments from tons of different people though.  PS:   I don’t feel pathetic?  I feel aware.

"So finding 2 dumb redditors that support a thing is a representation that the thing is flawed? Newsflash - most people in crypto subreddits these days don’t understand crypto. There’s massive support for Verge, Tron, XRP, etc. all over Reddit. 

If you all were more honest with yourselves, you wouldn’t have to go more than a couple posts to find one of your own saying stupid shit. "
"so here's my take: bitcoin's security relies on hashrate, hashrate is provided by miners for economic incentives, incentives are inflation and fees, inflation is quickly diminishing and was only put in place to avoid pre-mining all coins and get miners on-board, over time more and more incentive will be coming from tx fees.

*there has to be a reasonable fee market and reasonable fee market means that fees go high when demand goes up. without reasonable fee market miners have no economic incentive to provide chain security.*

the promise of keeping the fees as low as possible by bumping block size every time throughput hits the ceiling means destroying the fee market and has one of two conseqences:

- rules about bitcoin inflation will have to be adjusted to keep providing miners with economic incentive
- miners will leave, hashrate will drop and with it - value of the currency/network

so yes, bitcoin was never designed to be a charity. if you want to maintain value of bitcoin through security of the network you have to understand why fees matter.

P.S. PoS is not a solution, marginal revenue always = marginal cost and PoS just obscures the cost and pushes it out of simple ""i've burned this amount of energy"" into political aspect of fighting for control over the stake to maximize profits."
didnt it have a bit more to do with drugs and privacy?
Why are we even discussing the viewpoint of one single redditor? This is getting absolutely absurd from both sides of the fence. Complete waste of time.
that was a giant argument between Tone Vays and some libertarian (link is on his site). Argument went until I can buy a stick of bubble gum with BTC without the TX fee being more then its a currency. 
Except he's also right that it wasn't created to be a charity. But he doesn't seem to understand that it was supposed to be a money, not an expensive to withdraw from savings account.
That's the kind of response I expect from todays BTC supporter. They only interested in what bitcoin can do for them and how much fiat they can rinse out of it.  One of the things I most hate about that community is that for years I used the coin I had to promote it, I spent literally thousands of $ worth of BTC getting BTC established and to a position it was only for it to get hijacked by the wankers there now.
That's just one guy
"Bitcoin was created as an act to benefit people affected by actions like ""Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.""

In other words, to benefit the entire world.

You can call that charity if you wish.

It also benefits the creator of Bitcoin, if he is still around.

You can say that means it is not charity, if you wish."
It's unfortunate that the scaling debate has gotten so toxic. We're talking bleeding edge distributed systems here. When btc reached > $100 bill valuation, security and nonlinear scaling became most important to some. Immediate scaling and merchant/consumer interests was most important for others. A couple months of high fees definitely hurt user adoption and public sentiment. Bitcoin is an ambitious, difficult project. Luckily, we now have two different scaling test cases. Let's work hard to make sure both work in the meantime.
The hype society knows no bounds 
"The censorship has cut down the BTC version of Honeybadger in his prime, left him a mere shadow of his old self, succumbing to the ravages of the ""experts'"" Frankensteinish full-blocks experiment. Yet still, propped up on stilts by wide-eyed investor newbs and pumped full of some opioid they call ""Lightning"" by intravenous drop, his vacant eyes catch a glimpse of something in the distance..."
how are the drama boy queens doing here? still censoring bitcoin in the btc forum :-) LOL
This is the Bitcoin community.
Which is hilarious to think that way in the first place. I work for a large investment group and we waive all wire fees, ESPECIALLY for our large client. That $40mil household? Yeah, they’re not paying a fuckin cent to move their money. Why? Because the income they generate is too much to risk over a bullshit fee. Write that off.
"Perspective: how many people have 1 million dollars they need to move?

Also if you do have it you can probably move it for less than $100 anyway."
A guy with an opinion on the Internet.  Good find. /s
F*** these Lambo minions 
">Following this sub ... is fucking lame.

Then leave.   

See what I did there?   Solved all your problems.

And ours.   

Win-win.

Bye."

I remember when Bitcoin wasn't about making me rich. 
"Anyone who is being honest with themselves and has done 15 minutes of research knows the only reason btc is even still alive is because of name recognition. It will die eventually and it's place will promptly be taken by it's competitors. 

Disclaimer: I do not own any btc or bch , eth, ltc or any of the big names.. so I feel I am being as unbiased as one can be."
I've been following bitcoin since 2009. The store of value argument didn't crop up until it started gaining incredible value and the advent of hodl'ing. Not a single forum I was in had people talking about it being a future beanie baby.
That's what happens when censorship is there. People tend to be more arrogant and think emotionally instead of logically.
"That's not the core purpose. The core purpose is that trust in issuance and settlement can be decentralized. Which should in turn make it more reliable because it's hard / uneconomical to cheat. 

The only reason that it was cheap is because the network secured low value and miners didn't have to work very hard (and it was economical) to include the few transactions that were there. 

The good part is that the decentralized trust can be scaled by payment channels to make even smaller transactions with a secured collateral. "
"As far as we know, Bitcoin was built as a monetary system divorced from state and government control, as a reaction to the financial crises of the early 21st century. 

It was devised as a monetary system divorced from centralised control; built on distributed consensus. "
Happens to anything once it becomes big enough
No way you could move internationally for less than $100 through a bank.
Even with high fee, Bitcoin will remain attractive. It's technically most sound crypto currency that we currently have. 
I agree, this does not seem possible.
Some co-workers joked about Bitcoin's high fees today at work. I could only smile.
"While I don't a agree with him; you can argue that mining rewards subsidize transactions fees. Sooner or later miners will need switch over to earning there bitcoins from mostly fees, not rewards. One could from that point argue that the high fees is the ""true"" cost of a transaction. And thus the mining rewards are a charity if you use them to keep down fees. 
Think that is the point he is trying to make. 

But yeah I don't agree with that reasoning, to me that seems like a argument for unlimited block size and let miners compeat to keep fees as cheap as possible."
"> Except he's also right that it wasn't created to be a charity.

How is having low fees ""being a charity""? There is a difference between giving money (charity) and not taking money (totally unnecessary exorbitant fees), low fees have *nothing* to do with the concept of a charity.

So the whole comment is a complete non-sequitur "
So then why?
This applies to every subreddit in existence. 
Redditor /u/bitconsult has low karma in this subreddit.
thank you
Weird, this whole time I thought it was awesome that people with minimal technological access/bank access were able to at least start using BCH on old ass phones, you know, the whole adoption thing. Sure, in the scheme of things, it is still cheaper at a $100 fee to move a million dollars vs through an institution, but wasn’t Satoshi’s original vision so that lower developed, less trustworthy governments wouldn’t need to be relied on for an individual to own their own wealth? Maybe I didn’t read between the lines or something. 
The good news is lessons learned make for stronger new coin. 
"It is strange, but it's unsurprising. I played with it a lot early on, because it was novel and it showed promise, the lack of adoption as an actual currency was the barrier that I figured would remain (and it has) and that would limit utility.  That and the fact it was quite hard to use anyway (The granny test etc..).

So I acquired and shared, swapped, transferred, mined, lost and generally bounced bitcoins all over the place (I never had thousands of them, I think I worked it out at 112 at my 'peak', with a value of less than $10..).  I never thought they'd be worth massive amounts per coin (I was impressed when it went to $1..).  

Now that they are are worth vast sums, it has changed the equation. The existing problems (spending them..) still remains, most people can't do their grocery shopping with bitcoin, and a lot of people wouldn't want to. They have gone from being currency like, through appreciating asset and speculative asset, to essentially stores of wealth to be converted into fiat when the value rises.

The fact that the value has risen so massively has, in my view, reduced both utility and any viable wide scale adoption. The explosion of other cryptocurrencies has offset that a bit, but that has then added in issues of exploitative schemes and fraud.  You can add the confusion created by things like bitcoin cash, and the linkages between cryptocurrencies and their forks too.

The technology is still interesting, and there is still a lot of possibility, but things haven't quite gone how I would have hoped.  Throw in that there are now so many odd, and frankly counter-intuitive applications where block-chains are shoehorned in, and that major banks and financial services providers seem to be creating centralised tokens of their own and even that fades a bit.

Shame really.."
It is ironic that they are accusing the people who did most to promote the Bitcoin brand of 'stealing' it for BCH.  In reality, they have stolen our brand for a coin that is drifting further and further from Nakamoto-san's white paper.
My thoughts exactly.  
">still cheaper at a $100 fee to move a million dollars vs through an institution

this is the part i dont understand. wire transfers are generally $30\-50 to anywhere, for any amount. Nobody charges a percentage of the wire amount \(that i know of\)."
[deleted]
yep, there are a whole bunch of fiat money handlers floating around here who desperately don't want to see BCH succeed.
I got likes , when does my lambo arrive? 
Is also what blockstream preaches 
With several upvotes...
I don’t understand why every post from this sub is just bashing other people. Is this the point of r/btc?
I'm sorry about that, but expecting people goodwill is a great mistake, you should always be looking on what is most profitable to yourself and predict such behaviors. Unfortunately, that's how things are in most places, especially regarding money.
