He's looking much healthier than he did in the last photo I saw of him.
He has a life sentence that has been affirmed on appeal. The USAO has no reason to spend resources on another conviction.
I seriously doubt that.  We need a true Libertarian like Ron Paul, or maybe Rand Paul and he would have a much better chance.

The eyes of the gov't sees different.
"Craig S. Wright, a man who claims to be Satoshi Nakamoto but won't provide any publicly verifiable proof. He has a lot of authoritarian viewpoints and ideals that very much go against the spirit of Bitcoin (he's pro software patents, is against untraceable money, against allowing for gambling at the protocol level, etc).

He wants to be the one to guide the future direction of Bitcoin Cash."
Hey buddy, you shouldn't actually kill yourself. The internet and planet thank you.
There is no proof of that and he was never charged for that.  It was likely fabricated by corrupt agents.  There were multiple corrupt agents like Carl Mark Force III who were running scams and stealing Bitcoin from the site during the investigation.  
That's the biggest crock of shit ever, there was zero credible evidence of this or they would have tried to prosecute him.
"> He tried to have multiple people murdered when running the Silk Road

No he didn't.  That was a lie told by the same people who absconded with a ton of money during the investigation."
Those charges were dropped months ago
Once the democrats have power again he’ll have a chance at a pardon 
The government of the USA is limited by something called the US Constitution, of which there is nothing written that authorizes the prohibition of drugs or substances.
The tyranny will be overthrown eventually

He also said he was fasting at times.
Yeah leaf, chill the fuck out and proceed to Facebook 
Fuck sakes man.
Then be my guess and GTFO. 
Sorry leaf but I rather see a picture of man in captivity for an victimless crime and judged by an overreaching government than reading your comments.

"Do you have any evidence to support that? My only information comes from the book American Kingpin, but the author at least claims that there are chat logs showing this. He also says that Ross hired an undercover cop to do one of the assassinations, and the cop took fake pictures.

Is there evidence sitting the evidence was fabricated?"
If I recall there are chat logs backing up the accusations, and Ross never denied them.
Even if he trafficked drugs, there is nothing in the constitution that allows for government to prohibit substances.  This is why they needed a constitutional amendment for alcohol prohibition. So the government are the criminals, enforcing unconstitutional laws.
"Eh, this is less about party than it is about government control. Democrats have lost the plot in terms of individual liberty, but that doesn’t excuse the post 9/11 Bush era freedom-stripping nonsense.

TL;DR: Big Government gonna keep big governmenting regardless of party."

"[He did tweet about it recently](https://twitter.com/RealRossU/status/1023004366360305664):

> The murder-for-hire charge was finally dropped today. What a relief! It really hurt to have that hanging over me all these years, to be accused of being something I’m not. I just hope I won’t be seen in that light anymore. http://freeross.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Doc_14_Dismissal_Indictment_7-26-2018.pdf …"
His mother has stated over and over the he denies the charges, you can watch almost any interview with her. 
There is no mention of him denying the charges in that article.
Can you provide evidence that the ex employee was made up? The book I read even gave a name the employee, which Ross supposedly knew because he had all of them send him their id. Again, I don't know how accurate this book is, but I'd need to see what evidence there is in favor of your claim before I'd accept it.
"Well yes. I'm not saying he should be convicted for the crime, but not being convicted and being innocent aren't the same thing.

What do you mean by faking evidence? I remember the stolen money, but I don't remember anything about falsified evidence."
In America you are supposed to be innocent until proven guilty. Anybody can be charged with anything, it does not make it true.

"It was completely made up by the agent. They suggested some ex employee was going to rat (got paid for the tip) then they said DPR should have him executed and introduced DPR to a fake Hitman (really just the same agent) to get more money.

The charges where not included in his ny trail because while it wasn't public yet the court knew it would destroy their case if it came to light that the feds extorted and falsified evidence. Then they dropped the murder for hire charges completely years later.

Ross was not a professional criminal he was in experienced, so best case (for the feds) they showed he was convinced by corrupt agents to order a hit and in reality he just got conned out of the money. 

His entire purpose was clearly stated as being about removing the threat of violence as a means of coercion in the drug war. "
"And none of that shit was tried in a court of law to prove the truth of the matter.

What was proven in the case were corrupt cops that stole money and faked evidence."
He never trafficked drugs either, all he did was make a website that allowed voluntary interactions.
Can you send me a link with a source?  I'd love to be wrong on this one because excepting the murder-for-hire I have nothing against Ross.
"Dangerous to the establishment. My views are dangerous, too; come at me folks"
Rand Paul is the biggest family disappointment since Billy Baldwin.
This reminds me of the Hans Reiser case.  The comments on Slashdot defending him and doing mental gymnastics to explain how he had not done the crime were amazing.   
"From what I remember of American Kingpin (no idea how accurate this book is), there are chat logs backing this up, and he actually hired an undercover cop, who was pretending to be a hells angel, to do one of the executions. Supposedly, they took pictures of the guy pretending to be dead and everything.

I don't think Ross was ever convicted of the crime though, so I don't think it's true that he never denied it."
Innocent until proven guilty, right? Obviously the government should charge and convict on evidence like that before starting it publicly. There's a reason they didn't charge him.
He absolutely denied them, and the whole case was dropped. There are no standing accusations against Ross, they were dropped as soon as the govt no longer needed their smear campaign
He was never charged, if he was he provably would have walked free because it would have really shown how many holes were in the whole entire case. Also, both agents who worked on the case are in jail for theft, faking evidence, among other things.
"If you want to learn about the entirety of the story, try here:

https://antilop.cc/sr/

TLDR: The hit was offered by an agent, to be carried out on a fabricated target.  Hence those charges were dropped before trial, but not before media had a field day with it of course."
"Oh, unless they wanted to, I don't know, uphold justice. Or actually hold a real trial rather than a sham trial. Or save a political prisoner. The judge literally cited Ross's political convictions as a reason for the harsh sentence during the sentencing: ""These views are dangerous"".

So yes, we should absolutely still be fighting this."
Rand Paul libertarian, lol
What evidence did they fake? I knew about the money from the book, but I don't remember it mentioning anything about falsified evidence.
"https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9f832m/google_play_finally_take_down_the_rogers_fake/e5vgkzv/

Fuck off"
I think there is at least a small chance of this.
He will get a pardon eventually.
The war on drugs cannot end too soon, and American punitive justice system needs to change. It caused more than enough pain already. So many people in prison serving extreme sentences for victimless offenses, which amount to just doing something that goes against somebody else's personal morals. Do you not want to consume hard drugs? You don't have to. Do you want \*me\* not to consume hard drugs? Go mind your own business buddy. Live and let live. America: the land of the free. Fucking joke that is.
Sure, 200000 people are going to overcome the Government of the United States of America, and pigs fly.
Why do you want him to get out? He tried to have multiple people murdered when running the Silk Road. 
He's doing great in prison so hes institutionalized. 
i encourage you guys to check out freeross.org for more information the trial was so corrupt and goverment just made a big example out of him to discourage others. A cocaine dealer with the same offense levels got 10 years ross got 2 life sentences, it really is fucked up.
Please keep this garbage on facebook. I don't come here to see criminals family photos.

This guy will be pardoned some day.

He was sick for a little while. He said on Twitter that prison is a bad place to get sick. I think he said it was a cold/flu. 
"Lol @ people thinking a drug trafficker responsible for the movement of literal tons of drugs into and out of this country is going to be pardoned.

Remember, CSW wants him to stay imprisoned.
What's CSW?
