"Might be more factual if you said they were fireworks so it doesn't sound worse than it is: ""explosives"" while technically is not accurate given the context."
"My opinion is this. Reddit is built to filter unpopular opinions. So moderators needn't address opinion.

Spam, crap and hate are a moderator's bread and butter.

""Go away"" isn't hate. It's dull. It's a waste of effort. But reddit has mechanisms to filter that."
It is indeed impressive how thin-skinned some mods seem to be. 
"Welcome to Reddit /u/Coloco.


Odd how all the accounts attacking him are throwaways. /u/memorydealers is one of the most important figures in Bitcoin, and much of its current success is thanks to him. What you linked in no way validates your derogatory attack on him."
"Roger's intentions are (probably/hopefully) pure, but it's not untrue that he has made plenty of questionable decisions in the past. A major mistake was vouching for Gox (through a very awkward video, as if he was being paid to read a text written by someone else) when that ship was sinking.

Now this move of appointing btcdrak raises major questions as well.

I believe Roger is too involved with many people and projects (that we might be unaware about) to make unbiased decisions."
">contradicting his words with his actions

Shortly thereafter posting a duplicate of his ""Community Guideline"" as a locked sticky thread. I really believed I was being trolled when I saw that, since his own guideline stated ""Please refrain from posting duplicates""."
"It's just the result of principled idealism. In fact, Ver is a principled idealist as well. The problem with principled idealism is that it's way too easy to convince yourself that your ideals justify anything. Ver had an incident where he used inside info at blockchain.info to take back the money of a guy who cheated him (well, refused to return an over-large refund Ver issued), which I can see as being justified by principled idealism, but certainly a grave misjudgment for all practical purposes. Theymos likewise got caught up in the logic of ""anything that isn't Core is an altcoin and hurts Bitcoin, Bitcoin is good so I must defend it with all means at my disposal, and the subreddit is such a means."" I can understand it, but it's of course delusional."
In my opinion btcdrak is unsuitable to be a forum moderator for anything Bitcoin related, please remove him as a moderator for /r/btc
"You must be new if you think /u/memorydealers is anything but a ripe shitstain on the underwear of humanity.

Here's where he doxxes some rando that he accidentally sent money to:

https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=131574.0"
Don't spend it all in one place. It might be worth two quarters some day.
Hot damn, it's the most valuable quarter I ever got. Thanks again, brother!
"Yes, but I don't see how it relates to it being ""too late"" to remove a moderator."
/r/BTC_CessPool lol
"Let me give some examples of the moderation style I will be using.

>No repetitive posts?

By this I mean for example that I will encourage people to not create multiple threads for the same article article. It is much more productive if the conversation happens in one thread rather spread across multiple threads. If the topic is huge though (e.g. ""USA accepts bitcoin as legal tender"" or something) then this would be fine.

>No being ""aggressive""?

People should not feel the need to assault or attack a person with personal insults. I will encourage users to be good to each other and respect that people have differing opinions.

>No faith in the community to downvote such things as they see fit?

I absolutely have faith that the community will upvote and downvote people as they see fit. This should be 99% of the moderation policy. I believe moderation (from the moderators) should only be a last resort.

>Sorry, I don't trust mods who don't trust their users.

I absolutely do trust the users. I don't believe a 100% zero moderation policy is good for a sub though. I promise that if you give r/bitcoinone a chance, you will see that it is adding value to the bitcoin community."
Blocked a post by Gavin (at least I suspect he did, though no one officially claimed responsibility) to the dev mailing list, despite it being completely on-topic (this was fixed later by Rusty).
We could all go and restart /r/WeAreBitcoin
/r/truebtc
He's welcome to participate as a user of course, I just don't think he's ever demonstrated any level-headedness when trusted with power.
Yeah, that's not so good. It looks like he's a fan of censorship far beyond even his own personal agenda as well.
"Too many mod rules there, too. No repetitive posts? No being ""aggressive""? No faith in the community to downvote such things as they see fit?

Sorry, I don't trust mods who don't trust their users."

"I don't know all the mods, but from what I've seen the safe thing to do would be to delete 'em all and put in some non-unknowns, people with respect in the community as solid posters with good dispositions. Some small blockers would be fine as long as they have good personalities. 

Just noticed jratcliff65567 was added, which is a much better choice even if not perfect in my opinion since willing to moderate off-topic away."
"As I said, you can have any reason you want, though I also didn't mean to say that I thought your reasoning was bad. Furthermore, any time I think something makes sense and put my money on the line I find I'm wrong.

I guess what I was intending to say is that keep in mind what we see here is just a small amount of what's going on in the bigger picture. 

With that said, there is likely to be money made off of drama like this

tl;dr : you're free to do what you want and I say a lot of unimportant stuff on reddit."
"I think that is the moderator acting like a spoiled kid.

If you break the rules you get banned but to avoid situations exactly like this you need to be seriously offensive to me to get banned just for being offensive. It's completely expected for people to get frustrated by mod actions so moderators need to have a very thick skin otherwise we'd just ban everyone."
"You're welcome man. Glad I could be the first to tip ya :)

I really liked what you wrote and I support it fully. What better way to show than to send a tip."
Why not /r/WeAreBitcoin? It has a similar goal (it was created in the past when /r/bitcoin got particularly bad) and has existed for much longer.
r/Bitcoinarchy no spam so bad that it can be moderated!
Whoah, thanks!!!! My first ChangeTip receipt ever. Nice of you to send it for my support in removing abusive moderation!
Which Borg?
I support the removeal of btcdrak as moderator. I think all mods in future should have to be voted in by the community and have the power for them to be removed. 
"I dunno, I think it sort of does.
There are unmoderated subs, e.g. (not Bitcoin-related):

https://www.reddit.com/r/unmoderated/

https://www.reddit.com/r/freefolk/

It's up to the ""owner"" / creator of the subreddit to appoint further mods or get involved in moderation. However, obviously if things get out of hand (which they probably will) then Reddit admins might step in and do something about it. So I guess in that sense, there are no ""safe spaces"".

P.S. I agree with your sentiment that to be impartial, we should let algorithms sort it out. The problem there is: those who control the algorithm are effectively the moderators. So it would have to be self-adapting machine learning algorithm - not under human control - that is fairly resistent to malicious attempts to influence it. Not sure if contradiction in terms or equivalent to general AI, but makes for an interesting thinking."
Yeh if you appoint a fraudster thief troll as a mod, that either says a lot about your character, your judge of character, or your care and attention when making decisions.  None of which are great attributes.
"Basically the very problems that made /r/bitcoin go to shit are coming here too.

Browse carefully."
"Maxwell, Back (Blockstream), Btcdrak, Peter Todd, Theymos and some lesser grunts are Borg.

We left /r/bitcoin because it has been assimilated by the Borg and now /u/btcdrak's appearance as a mod signals that /r/btc might fall too.

It's time to grab the pitchforks, BitcoinBoo."
"So many people have been working their butts of to bring users from /r/bitcoin to /r/btc. We handed this sub to them on a silver platter, and now /r/btc is fucking it up. Time to find yet another subreddit to help with, I suppose.

Here's a message I sent to the mods of /r/btc:

>  Hey mods,
Me, along with tons of other bitcoin fans have been working together to bring people out of the censorious doucheland of /r/bitcoin and into to /r/btc, as an alternative place where people can discuss bitcoin the way reddit was intended: though the community. It's been crazy to watch people spread the word about /r/bitcoin being abused by moderators and how /r/btc would be a safe haven from that. This subreddit grew so fast! You guys had so much going for you!

> Then you went and made /r/btcdrak a moderator, and gave him a platform to create his own vision of censorious douchebaggery. I can't believe you fucked it up! All that good will, all that community support, down the drain. I don't get it. Why did you do it? You do realize many fans of bitcoin are also libertarians don't you? Did you think we would stand for this?

> In any case, like most everyone else, I'm done helping. I'm going to find a subreddit that shares my values of open discussion and letting reddit work the way it was designed to work. No heavy handed ""moderation"" or random bannings. That's a deal breaker. We moved on from /r/bitcoin and we'll move on from /r/btc."
btcdrak has a conflict of interest in moderating this community. He has exercised his moderation power within hours of receiving it specifically to silence dissent and establish authority using techniques most of us are familiar with from that other subreddit. This destructive behavior undoes everything this subreddit was established for, and needs to be reversed immediately for the good of the technology. Bitcoin cannot survive if its users cannot have their voices listened to.
I agree with this post
Can we please go just one day without drama in the BTC world, just one day?
"I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

- [/r/bitcoinone] [\[Repost\] Request to Roger Ver: Please remove btcdrak as a moderator. Anyone who upvotes this post is showing their agreement with this request.](https://np.reddit.com/r/bitcoinone/comments/3x0ikt/repost_request_to_roger_ver_please_remove_btcdrak/)

#drama
"What is this, kindergarten? 

How about instead of counting votes and being a drama queen, you try to actually articulate *why* it is ""unacceptable"" for btcdrak to be a moderator? "
"So far Roger has been very patient with the non-stop whining, mobbing, and disrespect on r/btc where ignorance was upvoted and knowledge was downvoted. 

Roger probably realized he had nothing to gain from letting childish behaviors transform r/btc into a cesspool of ignorant whiners. 

By appointing btcdrak as a moderator, Roger is sending a very strong signal to r/btc : the mud party is over and it's now time to build a friendly and knowledgeable place to discuss topics on this Bitcoin thingy we all care deeply about."
"@btcdrak is a great part of Bitcoin Whaleclub and lets give him all a hand for stepping up to perform mod duties.

- Adam
"
You've forgotten that he stole more than 1000 BTC from his altcoin viacoin that after the ICO he said was personal funds for himself instead of development. He lost all of that on trading btc.
"Haha! You still have Armstrongs references to this sub on your page!

Is it possible that you feel like you got nothing if you remove those? lol"
Creeps are drawn to power because they are small and empty inside.
Btcdrak should not be a mod because he is too knowledgeable of the bits & bytes of bitcoin, its behind the scrnes politics, AND he expresses his views, rather than echoing others. A mod should be anemic and viewless. He doesn't qualify! 
I agree. No moderation is key. No one shoudl get modded for anything ever, not even spam, which is why I have innovated and started r/Bitcoinarchy!
"which is just ridiculous, because even if BP101 isn't adopted (and i don't really give a shit if it is or not), it finally put pressure on the bitcoin development community and led to dialog that this shit has gone on too long, and something needs to be done.

It's essentially a poison pill for bitcoin core if it did nothing. So BIP101 succeeded whether it's adopted or not.

Even more interestingly, the rift in the development community has exposed such an autocratic nature in the governance of the ""open source"" system that there will be serious scrutiny on their behavior going forward. 

The walls are closing in on the core devs and blockstream proponents who are trying to co-opt bitcoin for their personal vision - it is their choice to adapt or die, just like every innovative community before them"
"I mean come on, was that ""Go away"" necessary? It makes you look like a child, he stated that he did not care whaqt you thought about him and the conversation should have ended there. However, the ban was not in any way called for and i'm on your side on that part, but I don't believe he should be removed from moderation due to it (assuming this is a secluded incident). Regardless, what is your reasoning behind you not wanting btcdrak as a moderator. You provided no reasoning in this thread nor your post. I believe you should be able to provide some evidence of his previous wrong doings."
Please check out r/bitcoinone. Its a sub where we can all work together to make bitcoin achieve its potential and move out of beta and into bitcoin1.0.
/u/ChangeTip, send 1 awesome
"Banned for saying ""go away""? 100% would not fly in the 200,000 subscriber subreddit I moderate."
I doubt it. Which sub reddit is that? If i said go away to a mod after he approached me in a respectful and humble way i too would get banned. It happens everywhere. If you act like a spoiled kid you get banned.
"*chernobyl169* received a tip for 1 awesome (549 bits/$0.25).

r/Bitcoinarchy/ is the solution to all your problems!
well i just unsubscribed from here as well now. 
You nailed the play by play. Well done. 
"> Don't moderate comments too heavily.

I think that is the key.

Remove spam. Remove illegal content.

Let everything else stay. Profanity. Personal attacks. Whatever. Also lowers the workload of mods.

Before btcdrak, /r/btc was actually doing pretty well IMO."
Unsubscribing until this is resolved.  You can find me in /r/bitcoinxt
Gone yet?
I think most of us have already established this. Do a little research if you don't know why.
What a dick move. Poor judgement on his part. His first post was fine, not everyone needs to like him, but now he's contradicting his words with his actions.
First time checking out this sub because I do not like r/bitcoin. What did i miss?
"Almost a day later and btcdrak is still a mod.

Fuck you /u/MemoryDealers

/r/btc is dead"
"Looks like its time for my litmus test. 

Go fuck yourself /u/btcdrak"
">The best mods are those who don't want to be mods.

sounds like you'd be perfect for the job then...;)"
"The only way to deal with this is to let algorithms sort things out. Humans are utter *shit* at moding anything; both forums and money (which is why Bitcoin was invented....). Too bad Reddit doesn't support subs without moderators (AFAIK)..."
Everyone hates the moderator because he must moderate. I have beleted the moderators in a state of great Nirvana. r/Bitcoinarchy
Publicly posting a personal and privately held opinion constitutes gaugeable action in most books. What he said was truly shitty and less than useless, I for one think that says a lot about him.
Btcdrak is part of the borg. I refuse to visit a forum where he has any sort of power.
No just an oversight. Will be fixed thanks
"I didn't know that, but being a scamming thief seems to be a common theme amongst small block proponents, it seems being a thief really helps get you noticed enough to moderate on Reddit.

I wonder why we're so suspicious of the financial motivations."
How old are you? 12?
