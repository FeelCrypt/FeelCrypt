"Actually its called abbreviated signatures and is a user activated softfork that were incorporated a long time ago. SMS has an interesting implementation that uses abbreviated signatures to enable op_emoji.
So what happens in english is that you can only fit so many words into a sentence. Words then become expensive and you should what you can to limit their character count so you sneak more words in the sentence even though technically you shouldnt be able to. Thats called charwit but we wont go into that right now.

If you take words that show up over and over you can actually make an abbreviated hash where a sane assumption can be made on its content. So you register the short once in the first 4 bits to signify the code then the following 12 bits make up the word.

Bitcoin

Bitcoin Platinum

Bitcoin Forever

Bitcoin Gold

Bitcoin Cash

Bitcoin becomes b, saving the characters and allowing more words in each sentence. 

Bitcoin

Bplatinum

Bforever

Bgold

Bcash

An interesting function that this opens is the ability to store entire sentences this way. This opens the possibility of something called Essay Processor which can instantaneously generate sentence exchanges allowing for paragraphs to instantly form with basically no way to know where the sentences came from and basically non existent cost.

Yep.  The stress test with 2.2 million transactions in 24 hours has vindicated on chain scaling.  This brought even Greg Maxwell back to the sub.  :)  So you know the trolls are busy.  Plus the sub is getting increased organic traffic from users who are questioning the Blockstream narrative.  Where is their peer to peer cash?  Why does BTC need all the special doohickeys and thingamabobs, when Bitcoin Cash can do 2.2 million transactions in a day with fees about $ 0.001?  Now the narrative controllers are here working overtime LOL.;31;1;False;CryptoshiStackamoto;e5ifco0;This sub is under major attack;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/9dlmsf/this_sub_is_under_major_attack/

"My post on Craig which was actually a call to not be so petty on social media (as he already is for us) and instead try to critique him better was initially heavily downvoted. 

While I'm obviously not pleased by this, perhaps worse was to see the sudden influx of clear bot upvotes (20 something) after half an hour or so of nothing. It would appear they blindly vote on Craig related posts after a set time.";7;0;False;fruitsofknowledge;e5ilwq3;This sub is under major attack;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/9dlmsf/this_sub_is_under_major_attack/

">Nobody attacks what isn't dangerous.

This isn't true at all. Bullies will often attack others who can't or won't fight back. And they do it because they think they can get away with it, not because they think the person or thing they are attacking is dangerous. Core trolls are coming out of the woodwork because they see the vulnerable position Bitcoin Cash is in with its current political divide.

We all need to realize that Bitcoin Cash is not in a position to split apart.";10;0;False;;e5il3j7;This sub is under major attack;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/9dlmsf/this_sub_is_under_major_attack/
