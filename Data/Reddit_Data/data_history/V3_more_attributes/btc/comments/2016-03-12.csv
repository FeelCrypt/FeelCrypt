"Who are you?

You accuse me of changing data presented on my site. Ever heard of site updates? I wanted to show different and more useful data, so I made a new graph a week ago. I do it periodically. I didn't feel the 1mb vs 2mb graph was much different data than the first graph on the site. I feel the 0.12 Classic vs 0.12 Core graph shows more up-to-date and relevant data. And this graph was specifically requested by multiple users, so I made it. Your bizarre claims of me making a new graph for some ulterior purpose are completely wacko. It had nothing to do with the PSA at all. I updated my graphs a week ago and the PSA was in the past 24 hours. You are trying to connect two things which are unrelated.

>Why the need for the constant changing and promoting of that site???

It's my site and I like to build it up to be better. Why would I cease constructing it?

And why would I not promote my own website? That's what website owners do-- we promote our sites.

You lost major mod points with me for this weird post. It seems like you side with Alex, which is up to you. But then to accuse me of things makes you seems really off.

This, in my mind, is the main problem that most people aren't discussing. Developing bitcoin software is hard work, and the people doing it should get paid for it. But how?

Similarly, we created confidential transactions as a tool I hope will, in some form, eventually be available in the Bitcoin network; but have no revenue generating plans for it there (nor can I think of a way that it ever could be).

"Blockstream has already determined that the original plan for Bitcoin laid out by Satoshi is a failure. The argument isn't about block size, that's part of it. The argument is about settlement layer vs peer to peer payment system.

Since Blockstream has already determined that  Bitcoin has failed as a p2p payment network so there will be no need to increase block size on chain.  Side chains are their goal.

If this is true then Bitcoin is a failed experiment and will most likely be replaced.  People on both sides are entrenched. It seems like Blockstream has the advantage if the majority believes Bitcoin can only be a settlement layer.  

I believe there is room for on chain scaling before we call Bitcoin as a p2p payment network a failure. Sadly Blockstream won't even entertain the thought of trying.

Yes, that private message is from me. I wrote it in the hopes of correcting the inaccuracies listed in the PSA on his site, which in my opinion is different from postings on Reddit, Twitter or the various community forums. Nodecounter, after all, is a site intended to provide factual data about the system itself. It would be one thing if Hellobitcoinworld was advocating for Bitcoin Classic on its merits, but to lay out a rationale based on factually inaccurate and baseless claims about Blockstream, to me, went beyond the pale. If a news publication reported the same things as fact, I would have asked for a retraction. But what about all those fallacies? Why is the response to just amplify them (e.g., keeping miners under our thumb)? That's unfortunate.

How is that possibly good for Bitcoin?

It is possible that his investors, or more likely their investors investors, are executing a hidden plan to cause bitcoin to fail.

"No, that is no what he is saying-- he's saying that Blockstream's commercial interest in lightning isn't lightning on the Bitcoin network; it's lightning in other networks. 

Lightning on the Bitcoin network is a great and long term important thing; and something we're happy to support and contribute to as part of our broad Open Source contributions, along with the half dozen other groups working on it... but our commercial plans for Lightning is as a scaling tool in sidechains-- where it applies no less.

"If Blockstream isn't planning on releasing LN for Bitcoin and they also aren't going to raise the blocksize, then how the heck are they planning for Bitcoin to scale to reach the masses?

As far as I can tell they aren't.

And the petty gains SegWit might make (if it wasn't bugged code) is not a scaling solution significant enough to matter, even if it did work properly (and even if it did get adopted widely enough).

So basically Blockstream just admitted they are not trying to let Bitcoin grow in any meaningful way.
