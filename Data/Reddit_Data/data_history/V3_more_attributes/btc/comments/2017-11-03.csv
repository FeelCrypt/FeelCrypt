No 99%. While we have had one or two where users have cleaned up loads of low value inputs that would be pretty expensive to move on BTC as it’d have a much much higher tx size and thus fee than normal. But for the next few years, 8MB full blocks will be a rare occurance, and we can change a configuration file to upgrade as a network to 32mb max no hard fork. So while probability drops long term, it should average out to 99% to get confirmed in the next block for a long time and manny if us hope t9 keep growing blocks if it shows successful and healthy;1;0;False;Inthewirelain;dp9he64;BTC just hit $7000;https://i.redd.it/c26cu3qaeivz.png

On the other hand, if Bitcoin continues to be the best medium of exchange, then the secondary (side-effect)  ""store of value"" value will be secure, because everyone can be confident that it will be valued/bought far into the future.";1;0;False;SpiritofJames;dp9hlm3;BTC just hit $7000;https://i.redd.it/c26cu3qaeivz.png

You will not get a non biased perspective from anyone regarding BCH and BTC . I am biased towards bitcoin so keep that in mind as I explain to you the differences -

**Bitcoin (BTC)** -

99% of developer/specialist support

Far more hashrate - http://fork.lol/pow/hashrate

Larger community of users

99% of merchant support

Far less mining centralization

Far more node decentralization

Most devs Road map is for conservative scaling and focus on security , privacy and fungibility.

Current capacity allowance is 14 TPS (transactions per second) average with most txs using segwit and millions of txs per second for LN payment channels (used right now but awaiting GUI development finished for widespread use)

LN wallets we are testing right now -

**B Cash (BCH)**

Roadmap is focusing on cheap tx fees and many hard forks for larger capacity blocks at the risk of centralization and lower security.

Currently doesn't have transaction malleability fixed so is stuck with a mere 56TPS max throughput. Their focus is primarily on onchain scaling but do open the possibility up for L2.

Is still vulnerable to this PoW vulnerability - https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-9230 which is largely neutralized in bitcoin with segwit

As a dev on an open source project, you don't get paid for making code, so in order to do so, they had to find a way to get a cut of the transaction fees (miners will refuse to give up block rewards).  How to do this? 

They have to code in an entire new layer of code to provide additional services (LN, sidechains) to users.  But they have the same problem of inconsistent source of income; plus donations are low (b/c average transaction is low -> buy coffee!).
