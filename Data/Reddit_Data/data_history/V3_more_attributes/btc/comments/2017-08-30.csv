"> Overlays over Reddit would probably cause more problems than just simple suspensions though.

Apparently creating and running ceddit has not caused any problems (https://voat.co/v/go1dfish/2011562). It looks like it had some third party technical issue which will be fixed soon, though. It was not banned, even though reddit could ban it if they wanted. Apparently spez himself is supportive of the idea of making hidden/deleted content available somewhere: https://np.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3djjxw/lets_talk_content_ama/ct5sip8/

Another idea: re-submitting the link or submitting the link to the text post in your subreddit so that people browsing the censored subreddit can see ""other discussions (2)"" and want to click it when it says there's 2 or more, and find out the uncensored version(s) of the discussions. Your bot could make a new comment there for each censored comment, quote it and put it in context.

You see, the things the moderators censor are sometimes quite revealing of the moderators themselves and their buddies. Many people would be interested to find out what has been censored easily and quickly as they are browsing the censored subreddit, and additionally be able to (somewhat) seamlessly continue the conversation (which ceddit doesn't offer).

 removecomment by AutoModerator 7 hours ago Removed, **account age less than required** : tippr 

If you look at the account age of tippr, it is 7 hours old it says, so maybe there is a rule that doesn't let brand new accounts comment? I see he is commenting now on /r/btc with no problem and have pasted a link to his profile and a copy paste of his comments. Also notice, it says it was AutoModerator that removed it. If it was removed within less than a second, I am sure the API that is polling reddit for comments wasn't fast enough to pick it up. I would assume the API calls reddit every few seconds or so, if it was instantaneous it would be insane for the bandwidth required. 

Also, it is completely possible tippr deleted their own comment later which would make it invisible to any other site, thus making the comment not be there. 

I think you are going way to down the rabbit hole on one random person's comment. Looking through the other parts of the mod logs looks fine to me. I consider this case closed and no issue is happening here.

Maybe when the account is less than a few hours it doesn't let it comment, to   drown out spam or something? Not sure on that rule.

The rule actually specifically says: Promotion of client software which attempts to alter the bitcoin protocol without overwhelming consensus is not permitted.

SegWit was contentious(I have personally been in favor for some time, just FYI - and in fact, the only reason we got it was the very NYA agreement that you're claiming has no consensus, as much as people like to say that the 4% of nodes running UASF was the reason...speaking of, not sure why that was allowed to be discussed seeing as it didn't have overwhelming consensus either, but I digress...) but we discussed that for ages quite freely.

No person or group of people ""only tells people the truth"".  This is a sad statement that reveals the blinders you're wearing.

>You can't blame us for wanting to educate people about what Bitcoin really is

""What bitcoin really is"" is a matter of consensus, and right now, the consensus says that bitcoin values infrastructure decentralization over throughput.  That is, the consensus is currently that r/bitcoin is right about what bitcoin really is.  But you're right, I can't blame r/btc for trying to spread *their* version of the truth, just as I can't blame r/bitcoin for trying to spread theirs.

>and there is a lot of deliberately misleading information on r/bitcoin.

"> What is the bias of the mods at /r/bitcoin in general can someone clue me in? I would guess Bitcoin permabulls?

Most recently the moderators were directly involved in protecting and participating in the astroturfing and shilling around the BIP 148/149 UASF scam against people exposing the truth about it, which is that it was all about duping victims into losing all their BTC. It was a technically sophisticated scam and they were counting on ignorance, but had to resort to censorship, too.

Additionally, they have a strong bias towards pumping the altcoins of Charlie ""cobble"" Lee and BTCDreck and hypocritically FUDding other altcoins. They FUD and disparage even BTC and try to replace it with forkcoins, so definitely not Bitcoin permabulls.

They also participate in other seemingly pointless astroturfing campaigns, such as promoting alternative and deceptive unit names instead of BTC/mBTC/satoshi.

"> Not working well yet

Yes, it has a number of issues.  It is still in testing.  We didn't want to make any communications yet but /r/bitcoin beat us to the punch so we needed to.  It got hung last night and again this morning.  Both were fixed, but there are undoubtedly more issues that will arise.

It is also very conservative.  It tries to not message people at all when it isn't sure of the situation and/or removal state.  Reddit does not make this easy for a few reasons.  When it detects some of the internal data getting screwed up, it's currently in debug mode so it stops until we can determine the cause and/or add more analysis code and restart it.

One of the next features we're going to make is an opt-in feature where you can specify for the bot to message you even when it doesn't have the sureness that it wants for normal messaging.  We've got a full schedule with other stuff this week so that will be a next week type thing.

> Intuitively, I'd expect reddit admins to frown upon a bot planning to send a large amount of unsolicited private messages

I hope the admins reach out to us if that is the case.  We've discussed and considered adding opt-out features and/or rate-limiting messages to individuals by default, but so far it hasn't been necessary and the response today was overwhelmingly positive.

"I'm very glad to see that someone spends their time and effort to implement this. It has been badly needed for some time. Some moderators went to the point of censoring (even manually) posts exposing scams. They have long been very underhandedly censoring in ways which don't let anyone know what has happened.

**I would suggest to notify not only the sender, but also the recipient** (commenter or OP/submitter) to whom the comment is in reply to. I've seen all too many conversations being interrupted by the insidious, usually automatic censorship. Hopefully your bot can let participants seamlessly continue their conversations uninterrupted, publicly or privately (you could add a link to e.g. PM the other participant and another link to start a new discussion in another, perhaps dedicated subreddit).

You could quote the sender's message. You can prove to the recipient that such a censored reply was indeed addressed to them by linking to the commenter's profile page the way I did here with the ""after"" *get* parameter:

https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6474l0/i_was_banned_on_rbitcoin_after_years_of/

e.g.: https://np.reddit.com/user/fts42?after=t1_dfvcyjv

You can instruct them that the comment in question is shown first on the page and that they can click ""context"" if they want to see that the comment in question is indeed in reply to the recipient and whether or not it is still hidden in the thread.

I don't know how you detect the comments or posts, but I guess you monitor all the accounts that have ever posted to any of the Bitcoin-related subreddits for new comments/posts that don't appear in the threads. I think that it is important to get high reliability and speed in notifying senders/recipients. Perhaps it is possible to monitor all accounts, even new ones, so that you don't miss any hidden comments/posts.

It would be nice to make the bot's source code open. Thank you so much for your effort!

Edit: Some more suggestions: add the ability to make a list or a summary/count of hidden comments/posts by a particular user throughout their history (I know I have more than a few) and then add this information (or a link to it) in the PMs to the senders/recipients of new hidden comments/posts. Also send this information in case someone makes a bold claim such as this quote from the discussion you linked: ""AFAIK, having been here some 4+ years, I haven't had a single comment automodded"". Perhaps add the ability for users to invoke this check and see the results.

"""Malleabillity is a major issue for blockchain innovation like drivechain, LN and cross chain atomic swaps.""

That is exactly right. And with bitcoin cash, we actually scale on chain like we are supposed to, so there is little need for those types of things yet. 

You see on BTC, the corporation Blockstream has fought hard to choke on chain scaling in order to PUSH business onto L2, where THEY make the fees. They need a malleability fix to do that. That's why they pushed segwit so hard. AND, that is the reason for the restriction of the block size.

On Bitcoin Cash, we don't do that. We scale on chain just like it says in the white paper.  We are not pushing business off chain to a corporation. So in our case, it is really not necessary. 

That's not to say we're opposed to L2 though. We just don't need it right now because we scale properly on chain. In the future, if it is needed, we may develop a second layer for micropyments, but it's really not a priority. 

Check out the ""yours"" platform. It is a decentralized social media platform that runs on BCH micropayments, but it's full on chain. Pretty cool. Fees of 1 cent are getting through just fine, on chain.
