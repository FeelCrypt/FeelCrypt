"Hah, projecting much?

I've spent the last couple of hours studying this, since it's clear that asking real technical questions here is pointless, yielding only vague claims, citations that don't actually back up the claim, and conspiracy theories.  I no longer have any doubt that the witness data is ""segregated"" to *another part of the block* in a segwit client, where it's stored with the block, hashed into the block headers, and delivered to any peer who asks for it, as part of the block.

The confusion seems to arise from the fact that it's not sent to old, un-upgraded peers because they wouldn't understand how to use it, as I originally posited.  That's how backward compatibility always works: the old code misses out until it's upgraded but at least retains *some* functionality rather than simply breaking.  You're confusing that the data *can* be separated with the idea that it *must* be separated.

> [it's] right in the fucking name!

Are you really admitting that you've made your judgement based on (a misunderstanding of) the *name*?  Just... wow, you're not supposed to reveal that.  It's almost like you had already decided to hate it and were searching for justifications, picking up any negative thing you could find without regard to its veracity.  It feels good to find confirmation of your opinions, I know, but facts are better than comforting falsehoods in the long run.

I was originally hesitant to even ask since discussions here so often descend into pointless, information-free flame wars and, sure enough, here we are.  I ended up learning a lot, but from studying specs and code, no thanks to you.  Thanks for keeping it civil for so long, I suppose.

Here are 2 reasons Segwit has no effect on Litecoin, 1) is because it's hardly used, and 2) transactions are not being limited by block space. 

Segwit will not degrade bitcoin if no one uses it, Segwit is only viable if block space is limited and the only way to increase capacity is to remove the security signatures. BCC is a hedge against fundamentalists who think they can stop the 2X hard fork November 18.

This is the equivalent of saying miners could work together to force a larger mining reward per block. Miners alone can't dictate protocol rules.

"> I'm talking about a concerted effort by a significant majority to conduct validationless mining which is a known bug in segwit.

It doesn't matter if it's 100% of the miners.  Any block that includes a tx with an invalid signature will be rejected by the network.  Do you not understand that?  Exchanges won't accept that invalid chain.  Any miner that build on that block will lose revenue.  This will cause a hard fork.  This isn't a flaw in segwit.  That is a lie.

> This is a bug which means it can go unnoticed - that is the definition of a bug. So there won't be any fork that you keep insisting will happen.

You don't understand this at all.  Validation-less mining only causes a problem when an invalid tx sneaks in, and miners don't correctly reject it.  Smart miners will validate and reject.  Greedy miners will skip the validation, but it will bite them in the ass because it will fork them off the network.  The block will be 100% invalid to all nodes on the network, regardless of how many miners attempt to build on it.";2;0;False;gizram84;dkz9yy3;"Holy shit!

"> BIP144 adds new messages types, but those aren't separate, they're the replacements. This is how it's backward compatible, so the witness information that's in the block is not delivered to peers that would not be able to parse it, instead they will receive a block with random-seeming scriptPubKeys (witness commitments) and no witness data

I didn't check the code to see if the new message types were used as a full replacement for the old message types or not because ultimately that's a distinction without a difference.  An attacker could separate the data without much trouble by simply setting up a second peer that runs only the legacy code and relaying the block through that client.  As compact blocks / fibre backbone don't require segwit, those could ensure that the block is relayed throughout the network even though segwit clients would be wanting/missing the witness data.

> All the witness data is in the block and included in the block header hash so 

The witness data header isn't in the block header, it is in a hash of a hash inside data that isn't always required.  This is all valid enough to be relayed for backwards compatibility reasons.  Ultimately these are strong arguments for why Segwit should have been a hardfork instead of a softfork, which is something several bitcoin developers requested/proposed but were ignored.  If Segwit were a hardfork instead, the witness discount could also have correctly targeted UTXO creation/destruction instead of the hack that accidentally encourages heavier signatures and junk data.

> There is no change in the meaning of anyone-can-spend transactions, it's simply that if you were to construct a transaction using that as an input it would be rejected by the network.

Signatures are never gone, they are transmitted as part of every transaction and block, downloaded by default by all Segwit nodes. 

It's possible for an individual node to choose to prune some historical signatures after validation, but frankly... today's existing pruning discards the transaction data as well, and we don't see people screaming that the sky is falling because of it.
