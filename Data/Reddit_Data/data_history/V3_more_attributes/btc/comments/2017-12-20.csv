"The bitcoin network reached maximum capacity recently. It wasn't unexpected - for the better part of the last two years or so, everyone in the bitcoin community basically knew that we were approaching max capacity rapidly, and the community was divided about how to solve the problem. One part of the community wanted to increase the size of the ""blocks"" of transactions, which would increase the capacity of the network at the cost of requiring a bit more disk space on the network ""nodes"". The other part of the community favored inventing a seond ""layer"" of the bitcoin blockchain which would handle most transactions, freeing up capacity on the main chain at the expense of some added complexity and need for brokers to tie up capital in payment channels with the new layer.

The argument got contentious, and though attempts at compromise were made by major players from both sides of the debate, in the end no compromise was really reached. The part of the community that favored the ""big blocks"" approach split off and became Bitcoin Cash, keeping the same history of transactions as the main bitcoin blockchain from before the split but having its own distinct transaction history for dates after the split. The part of the community favoring a second layer for main transactions with the main layer for settlement stayed as Bitcoin.

Coinbase, the largest US cryptocurrency exchange, is now making Bitcoin Cash available for purchase and sale for the first time. In the space of time between the split and now, it's been kind of a hassle to buy/sell the new Bitcoin Cash tokens. Many people who had Bitcoin held by Coinbase are now getting access to their Bitcoin Cash for the first time, so there's likely to be interest in selling those tokens from people who don't believe in the big blocks solution, interest in buying those tokens from people that do, and investor interest in reading the momentum and jumping in when they think the price is favorable.";8;1;False;kevin2357;drioyiw;Buy, sell, send and receive Bitcoin Cash on Coinbase;https://blog.coinbase.com/buy-sell-send-and-receive-bitcoin-cash-on-coinbase-65f1b2c7214b
"bitcoin is a digital currency that allows you to quickly send money anywhere in the world for a low fee.

Well, that's what it was intended to be... bitcoin (BTC) doesn't actually accomplish this anymore, as it can cost $20-$50 to send very small amounts of money and can take hours or days, because the network can't handle all the transactions people are sending and is constantly stuck with a huge backlog.

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is basically a newer version, split away from the original bitcoin, that does what bitcoin was intended to do. It has an improved ability to handle large #s of transactions, and thus you can send your money for a low fee and get it quickly on the other end.

So Coinbase, the main app where people buy and sell crypto, just added bitcoin cash, which is huge because it greatly increases exposure of the cryptocurrency to the general public and makes it much easier to buy. So the general expectation is that the price of BCH will rise greatly in the coming weeks and months (outside of people invested in the original bitcoin who are here to try to downplay these facts to protect their investments).";4;1;False;mimeticpeptide;drioh2f;Buy, sell, send and receive Bitcoin Cash on Coinbase;https://blog.coinbase.com/buy-sell-send-and-receive-bitcoin-cash-on-coinbase-65f1b2c7214b

"No, it's certainly possible and Coinbase didn't have to take any hit.

Imagine if the order book looks like this:

* Person A is selling 1 BCH for $3500

* Person B is selling 1 BCH for $6000

* Person C is selling 1 BCH for $9500

New Buyer D checks Coinbase and sees the price listed at $3500.  He decides to buy $10,000 USD worth of BCH, expecting to receive 2.86 BCH.  Instead, the order book gets swallowed up due to lack of depth and he receives 2.05 BCH.

Coinbase doesn't take any hit, it's just a big disappointment for the buyer, and that's a reason that market buy orders can be really hazardous in low volume markets.

"The entire reason for implementing SegWit on BTC is that it is a necessary layer for adding Lightning Networks after.  Lightning Networks have been in development since 2015 and might be able to bring instantaneous & near-free transactions to BTC.   The fork only happened because over 95% of miners supported it. 

I‚Äôm bullish on BCH and have diversified to hold both.  But I‚Äôd recommend you keep your skin in the BTC game too, until we see how the Lightning Networks play out.  I think the first bitcoin-powered credit card will be operating on BTC.  

I also believe BCH has big potential to poach a lot of the best developers, and might be implementing SegWit2x of its own.  We might still see both coins climb.

"That's an answer noone can answer honestly since that would just be speculation.

However the actual value (rather than the price) used to be dictated by that bitcoin was a fast and cheap way to do international transactions and that is simply not the case with bitcoin anymore, it seems like people just blindly invest in it currently. So as you might guess, my theory is that the bitcoin price will drop once people stop blindly invest in it and you cannot know when that will happen. I personally have a lot more faith in other cryptocurrencies than bitcoin (ethereum, litecoin, bitcoin cash, rai blocks), but you shouldn't blindly follow the opinions of a stranger on the internet. It's practically betting but with a higher chance at winning currently, so please diversify your crypto investments!

"Both are evolutions of the original vision of Bitcoin which was intended to be digital cash owned by everyone rather than a community or a country. 

Since then Bitcoin has become more like digital gold - solid, reliable, cumbersome to use - and therefore needs a ""practical"" digital silver to go with it (via Litecoin or the Lightning Network they are developing) so you can buy your coffee at starbucks with it.

Problem is that Bitcoin was originally meant to be a stand alone system. 

Bitcoin Cash can do that and works as cash rather than just a store of value. Therefore some people see Bitcoin Cash as the ""real"" Bitcoin since it is closer to the original vision.

Problem is that Bitcoin Cash's solution that enables it to be used as Cash (ie bigger data blocksizes) is only temporary since it will end up in the same predicament and Bitcoin when it gets big enough.

They are competing visions of the same original philosophy.

The good thing is that everyone who had a Bitcoin was given a Bitcoin Cash coin too so whichever one won the ""battle"" wouldnt have mattered if you held onto both coins. 

But people have gambled that one side or the other will win so have sold one half of their coins - hence there is a lot of animosity between the groups.";4;0;False;theprufeshanul;driicg5;Buy, sell, send and receive Bitcoin Cash on Coinbase;https://blog.coinbase.com/buy-sell-send-and-receive-bitcoin-cash-on-coinbase-65f1b2c7214b

"1. Coinbase(GDAX) is one of the larger exchanges and user friendly. This is important as there are lots of new users incoming at the moment. Similar to say a large supermarket now stocking a new brand, more people see it as an option.

2. When the fork first happened, anybody holding Bitcoin was credited an equal amount of Bitcoin Cash. Coinbase did not allow users access to their Bitcoin Cash but are now doing so. 

There may be other points but they're less quantifiable. For example, /r/bitcoin criticism the legitimacy of Bitcoin Cash this can be seen as proving BCH's legitimacy. (Personally this is a non-issue).

Bitcoin‚Äôs has scaling difficulties and transaction fees are rising so high it has become unusable ($30 per transaction). To solve this the blocksize limit needs to be increased so more transactions can be processed in each block. Bitcoin cash is the bitcoin implementation which allows for bigger blocks and keep transactions cheap. Because of the prapaganda of the legacy bitcoin camp to smear bitcoin cash with illegitimate accusations of fraud and scam, the bitcoin cash community is excited to be recognized as a legitimate blockchain by being added to the most popular service to buy cryptocurrencies, Coinbase.;20;0;False;potcasso;dricxio;Buy, sell, send and receive Bitcoin Cash on Coinbase;https://blog.coinbase.com/buy-sell-send-and-receive-bitcoin-cash-on-coinbase-65f1b2c7214b
"I am a crypto noob but here is what i understand.

As bitcoin became more popular, its transaction fees were increased due to demand/supply but most importantly due to a deliberate architectural restriction on the maximum transactions per second. Basically the block size defines how many maximum transactions you can have per second.

Many people wanted to increase the block size, in order to increase the maximum transactions per second(thus lowering the transaction fee cost). 

But that would also increase the hardware requirements for miners and it would pose a significant risk to the decentralized nature of bitcoin. If hardware requirements got out of hand, then only few centralized data centers would be able to handle bitcoin.

So people argued about how much it should be increased. But then noone would agree. Anyway, some people decided that they would go ahead and fork(split) bitcoin and create bitcoin cash. They would have increased block size, thus lower transaction fees. For most intends and purposes, **bitcoin cash is a different currency than bitcoin**.

Some people think that bitcoin cash is too centralized and controlled by the bankers and shit. Bitcoin cash proponents argue that at least bitcoin cash is a usable currency, unlike bitcoin. They also argue that many developers behind bitcoin deliberately keep bitcoin handicapped(unusable due to fees), so they can propose their alternative centralized, bank controlled, blockchains on top of bitcoin.

There are a lot of money and astroturfing by all sides IMO. The reality of the fact is that it is hard to have a real decentralized system that can handle a high amount of transactions(visa level of transactions). So everyone is trying to become the new pimp, the new banks for the crypto era by pumping their own crypto.

Dont believe anyone.

"Careful who you trust, lots and lots and lots of FUD and lies from everyone on reddit, at the very least.

The tl;dr is that many people believe the current bitcoin core development group to be some combination of malicious or incompetent and they have refused to increase the block size (how many transactions can be done per ~10 minutes) and so transaction fees have gotten huge (~25$ per tx on average). 

There was a community proposal back a few months ago called the New York Agreement, NYA, where miners and businesses came together to update the network to twice as large blocks, as a stopgap fix for now. That attempt was called off because of it being contentious, which many here (myself included) would say was due to the core group not wanting to give up control as the ""reference client"" more or less, they were the biggest opponents.

So before the first part of the NYA went through (segwit), a group of developers forked the network with their own client, and created bitcoin cash (typically, BCH on exchanges, sometimes BCC). Bitcoin cash does not have segwit, and focuses on lower fees by having much larger blocks (8MB, vs core's 1MB).

Cash currently has negligible tx fees (pennies, or less), and many (including myself, again) see it as the true bitcoin, since it most accurately implements the system described by bitcoin's original creator, Satoshi Nakamoto in his whitepaper - https://bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf or https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf

Above, I link two sources for the whitepaper - bitcoin.com is run by Roger Ver who is pro-bitcoin cash, bitcoin.org is pro-core devs. I believe both pdfs are the same as of this post, but there was talk of changing it on the bitcoin core github, I'm not sure if that went anywhere, but that would be inexcusable if they did so. 

If you have any questions, please feel free to ask, I'll do my best to stick to the facts, but of course don't trust any one source.

"I know I speak for all of us when I say thank you to Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong for recognizing the vision of Satoshi Nakamoto when he created Bitcoin as a ***Peer to Peer Electronic Cash Payment System***.  Not a store of value alone, or digital gold nuggets that have no utility.  

Bitcoin was created to put the power of people‚Äôs money back into their own hands. Without permission. And give them the freedom to transact on a scale of any size ***directly on a decentralized, World Wide Ledger***.  

Most of all, Bitcoin was designed to be ***faster*** and ***cheaper*** than the banking system, and bring transparency to financial transactions in an attempt to reduce corruption in Banking.  Remember the message he embedded into the first transaction ever:  

*‚ÄùThe Times Jan 03 2009 Chancellor on Brink of Second Bailout for Banks‚Äù* ( [website] (http://www.thetimes03jan2009.com) )

Brian, we know you [went to meet with the Core devs](https://blog.coinbase.com/what-happened-at-the-satoshi-roundtable-6c11a10d8cdf) before the fork, and asked them to reconsider.  They couldn't be bothered.  Now even the creator of Ethereum is [backing Bitcoin Cash and condemning the censorship](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/930276246671450112) on /r/ Bitcoin.

"The bitcoin network reached maximum capacity recently. For the better part of the last two years or so, everyone in the bitcoin community basically knew that we were approaching max capacity, and the community was divided about how to approach it. One part of the community wanted to increase the size of the ""blocks"" of transactions, which would increase the capacity of the network at the cost of requiring a bit more disk space on the network ""nodes"". The other part of the community favored inventing a seond ""layer"" of the bitcoin blockchain which sort of issues IOUs for small transactions, with the main blockchain handling fewer transactions which serve mainly to settle groups of transactions on the secondary chain.

The argument got contentious, and though attempts at compromise were made by major players from both sides of the debate, in the end no compromise was really reached. The part of the community that favored the ""big blocks"" approach split off and became Bitcoin Cash, keeping the same history of transactions as the main bitcoin blockchain from before the split but having its own distinct transaction history for dates after the split. The part of the community favoring a second layer for main transactions with the main layer for settlement stayed as Bitcoin.

Both sides troll each other endlessly because the debate about how to handle the network capacity limit problem was contentious, and there's a serious lack of any kind of reasonable community organization or stewardship in crypto so most of the arguing happened over the internet, which doesn't bring out the best in people.";12;1;False;kevin2357;driafz4;Buy, sell, send and receive Bitcoin Cash on Coinbase;https://blog.coinbase.com/buy-sell-send-and-receive-bitcoin-cash-on-coinbase-65f1b2c7214b

"**Apple Corps v Apple Computer**

Between 1978 and 2006 there were a number of legal disputes between Apple Corps (owned by The Beatles) and the computer manufacturer Apple Computer (now Apple Inc.) over competing trademark rights. The High Court of Justice handed down a judgment on 8 May 2006 in favour of Apple Computer, but the companies did not announce a final settlement until 5 February 2007.

"We have not figured out a way to have 100% decentralization, no crypto achieves that, including Bitcoin. What is important is making sure that no participant has *enough* influence over the network to cause harm. Decentralization is also not the ""objective"", it is a means to the real objectives. In my opinion those are things like: removal of central economic planning and shifting monetary policy, uncensorable transactions, and facilitation of a modern global financial system which does not leave 6bn people without access to modern banking.

It is true that bigger blocks will make it impractical for *some* people to run a full node - however in my opinion 1 - 8 MB blocks are still a long way from outclassing modern home computers. BCH supporters don't necessarily think we will scale the block size forever - however we can certainly scale far beyond the current situation on-chain and we are also open-minded that we don't know what will be possible in the future.

You also have to look at the alternatives. Lightning Network requires locking up funds in open channels, so opening a channel has to be cheap - otherwise if you're poor then you're already censored out of the system. If many people want to use LN they all need to open channels, which is a few transactions per person joining the network. With high adoption rates you will still need big blocks just to open all these channels. Next, when using LN, people get to choose which hubs to open channels with. Logically they don't want many channels since each costs money, so they will open channels with the hubs that have the most channels with other peers, enabling you to send funds to a wide variety of destinations with minimal ""hops"". That will cause massive centralization as demand grows exponentially for the biggest hubs. Those hubs will also need massive funding to lock up in channels, so will have to take investments from banks or large corporations. This means the hubs will probably be legal entities with operating teams. Therefore, it is also likely that hubs will be regulated as money transmission services, and possibly required to identify their customers and report transactions to government bodies.

Let's also think back to the full node argument: *running a full node is good because you verify transactions on the network, and therefore big blocks are bad because less people can verify.* Well in a Lightning Network future, who verifies transactions? Actually only a couple of hubs and the recipient, not very decentralized. What do full nodes do? Certainly not verify transactions since the fees will be massive for anyone sending an on-chain transaction. They will only verify channels opening/closing and resolve disputed channels. At that point Bitcoin has become a decentralised ledger (clearing house) for hubs (banks) where individuals need to open a channel (checking account) to send money through a system where everyone takes a cut along the way and can refuse to process certain transactions. Then what did we achieve?";22;3;False;snowboardinsteve;drjddlw;My favorite response to the Coinbase BCH launch.;https://i.imgur.com/C0AvlKw.jpg
"Both BTC and BCH have some kind of ""centralization"" as large mining pools dominate and concentrate in china where electricity is cheap. However, BTC and BCH share the sime miners, they can switch between the two whenever they want. Saying one is more ""centralized"" than the other doesn't make sense. Bigger blocks will not really change anything as storage costs for the blockchain are tiny in comparison to mining equipment and electricity. Non-mining nodes could get less with higher need for storage capacity but non-mining nodes don't confirm transaction and aren't needed.";4;0;False;maibuN;drjctet;My favorite response to the Coinbase BCH launch.;https://i.imgur.com/C0AvlKw.jpg

> There is NO excuse for not raising BTC's blocksize to 8mb today. It can be done in 5 mins.

No excuses are needed. There are very valid reasons for bitcoin not to increase the blocksize to 8Mb. Blocks are easily filled and blockchain bloated so that soon normal users can't even stop a fork even if they wanted to because they can no longer run a node on normal computer over TOR.

To be honest I don't really know if 2Mb or 4Mb could even work long term. We just shouldn't bet the whole ecosystem for that little aid we might temporarily get from it. 

Fees are a problem yes. They increased to 0.5-1$/transaction due to full blocks and then increased 10x when the value of Bitcoin increased.

> It is limited solely to choke bitcoin. And it is working. If the block size had been raised, and this censorship program not engaged, all of us would be on the same coin and BTC would be $50,000 right now.

No it's not. Don't believe all the lies you've been told. Even if I own BTC, I don't really care that much about the price. I would actually like it better if Bitcoin wasn't so popular yet. It's hardly ready for mass adoption.

> Forget the Greek, I recommend you read Satoshi.

I have read everything by Satoshi I could find. He was in favour of off-chain scaling as well. In his post to Mike Hearn he even described conceptual Lightning Network (without the routing) using payment channels (""unrecorded open transactions"" as Satoshi referred to them).

"Do you really believe the conspiracy theories he spreads? The lightning seems awesome! And its safe way to scale without risking Bitcoins decentralization.

I was here before Hearns famous letter and before Mike and Gavin brought the fight to the public. I was originally in favour of block size increase.

Mike Hearn had his own motives to for wanting to keep transactions on chain. It had become apparent that he wanted to have some form of blacklists, but had to back off after being critiqued of it.

Before the block size debate began, most people thought that scaling would require data centers. Most also didn't like that but accepted it hoping Bitcoin could still remain ungovernable. Because this understanding many people were initially behind Gavin when he took the fight to the community. However after people had better understanding of implications of Lightning Network proposed in February 2015 things changed. People realized that LN could change the whole notion that Bitcoin must scale as a potential Trojan horse. With a blockchain fee market (discussed in the white paper under incentives, and made possible by Satoshi's block limit), and with the routed payment channels, Bitcoin could remain inflation free, well-secured, and practically infinitely scalable without risking becoming governable.

Why, right after the Lightning paper (which showed a better scaling method), did Gavin and Hearn all of the sudden take their fight to the community? It would seem that such a concept should have given them pause, but instead, they acted in furious haste (as though their window of opportunity was closing). Just as Hearn wanted blacklists and no Tor, he wanted all transactions on chain, and LN (and some other development proposals) was a threat to that.

Best way to prevent transactions from going dark is to take the control away from ordinary users. One way to do that is to increase the limit to 20 MB. Soon, ordinary users could not even stop a fork, because they couldn't afford to even run a node.

I think most core developers (and Blockstream) are trying to prevent Bitcoin from going down the path of fiat and financial monitoring.

Also I guess you don't spot genuine enthusiasm of Core developers. They are very sincere in what they say. And of course technical facts are on their side. This video with monotonic voice tells me that even the speaker himself don't believe what he's saying.

Bitcoin scaled from 10kb to 50kb, to 100kb, to 500kb, until it hit 1mb and then broke.  Why couldn't it get to 2mb? 

> The lightning seems awesome!

And so do fairies and unicorns - and we're likely to see one or the other this week.

> Before the block size debate began, most people thought that scaling would require data centers.

Gross exagerration.  Even Satoshi poked fun at this by saying that by the time the network grew, a 2 hour movie wouldn't take long to download on the internet.

> hoping Bitcoin could still remain ungovernable.

Bitcoin is governed.  It is stymied and the thought police block any dissension.  Thousands of use banned can tell you about it.

$50 fees are not a conspiracy.  They are brought to us by Blockstream - owned and run by bankers.  Bitcoin was to replace banks.  Now banks run BTC.  How is that lost on you?

LN isn't a supplement to Bitcoin - it replaces it.  You sell secondary services to REPLACE the chain.

Just what blockstream has done.  Banned any dissension & ran a massive disinformation campaign.  You can't buy $20 worth of BTC today.

Because for some reason everyone isn't upgrading for SegWit. And do you really think 2Mb will help with the current situation? What if the price (and fees along with it) increase another tenfold?

> You are misinformed - running a node doesn't prevent a fork. It might let you know about a change, but running a node doesn't do anything.

If 90% miners decide to fork, they can. However if majority of full nodes aren't backing it, there will be two coins and the legacy coin will win. The miners are forced to come back to the real thing. That's why 2x didn't happen. There was no consensus.

Ban anyone who doesn't toe their contrived mantra.  Great preservation strategy.  Many of us are here because we were shut out of discussion - we were shut out of participating in the direction of BTC.  That is called centralization.

Raise fees over 500x - yes, that is preserving Bitcoin.  More and more people are leaving each day - because of the fees.

Preserve Bitcoin?  They're hammering it.

> Because for some reason everyone isn't upgrading for SegWit. And do you really think 2Mb will help with the current situation? What if the price (and fees along with it) increase another tenfold?

This argument flies in the face of historical fact.  Bitcoin scaled fine, year after year.  It ONLY had problems once the mem pool filled.

> However if majority of full nodes aren't backing it, there will be two coins and the legacy coin will win.

This is incorrect.  You can have ALL of the non-mining nodes only accept chain A and if all the miners mine chain B, then chain B is all you have.  Non- mining nodes do nothing more than observe.  They're like UN soldiers on the front line with no guns - they have NO effect in the balance of power.

> No it doesn't. It just makes sure Bitcoin stays safe. Many other kind of scaling can be done on other layers. Not just LN.

Bitcoin was safe already.  It was out of the reach of bankers.  LN is the bankers.

that one node.**

""The bandwidth might not be as prohibitive as you think.  A typical transaction 
would be about 400 bytes (ECC is nicely compact).  Each transaction has to be 
broadcast twice, so lets say 1KB per transaction.  Visa processed 37 billion 
transactions in FY2008, or an average of 100 million transactions per day.  
That many transactions would take 100GB of bandwidth, or the size of 12 DVD or 
2 HD quality movies, or about $18 worth of bandwidth at current prices.

""The bandwidth might not be as prohibitive as you think.  A typical transaction 
would be about 400 bytes (ECC is nicely compact).  Each transaction has to be 
broadcast twice, so lets say 1KB per transaction.  Visa processed 37 billion 
transactions in FY2008, or an average of 100 million transactions per day.  
That many transactions would take 100GB of bandwidth, or the size of 12 DVD or 
2 HD quality movies, or about $18 worth of bandwidth at current prices.

**""If the network were to get that big, it would take several years, and by then, 
sending 2 HD movies over the Internet would probably not seem like a big deal.""**

You can scale BCH, for many many years, simply by increasing the block size.  Many in the core community argue that you can't do it for 10 years.  OK, so if you can do it for 2 years, why not?  Until LN gets here, which it won't.

"Common Blockstream propaganda point.

BCH is very decentralized.  It is BTC that is centralized.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYHFrf5ci_g

[Digital Currency Group](http://dcg.co/who-we-are/) owns (in part) and directs [Blockstream](http://dcg.co/portfolio/) (go to ""B"" and look 13 down). Guess who runs Digital Currency Group:
 
1. Glenn Hutchins: Former Advisor to President Clinton. Hutchins sits on the board of **The Federal Reserve Bank of New York**, where he was reelected as a Class B director for a three-year term ending December 31, 2018.
 
2. Barry Silbert: CEO of Digital Currency Group, (**funded by Mastercard**) who is also an Ex investment Banker at Houlihan Lokey. This is the guy who thought SW2x was a good idea.
 
3. Lawrence H. Summers: ""Board Advisor""
""**Chief Economist at the World Bank from 1991 to 1993**. In 1993, Summers was appointed **Undersecretary for International Affairs of the United States Department of the Treasury under the Clinton Administration**. In 1995, he was promoted to **Deputy Secretary of the Treasury** under his long-time political mentor Robert Rubin. In 1999, he succeeded Rubin as **Secretary of the Treasury**. While working for the Clinton administration Summers played a leading role in the American response to the 1994 economic crisis in Mexico, the 1997 Asian financial crisis, and the Russian financial crisis. He was also **influential in the American advised privatization of the economies of the post-Soviet states [a massive FUD campaign that caused Russian citizens to sell their shares in public companies - these shares were purchased by Oligarch bankers with ties to Western Banks and most Russian people had their national resources stolen from them]**, and in the **deregulation of the U.S financial system, including the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act**.""
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Summers
 
4. Blythe Masters: ""Former executive at JPMorgan Chase.[1] She is currently the CEO of Digital Asset Holdings,[2] a financial technology firm developing distributed ledger technology for wholesale financial services.[3] Masters is **widely credited as the creator of the credit default swap as a financial instrument**. She is also Chairman of the Governing Board of the Linux Foundation‚Äôs open source Hyperledger Project, member of the **International Advisory Board of Santander Group**, and **Advisory Board Member of the US Chamber of Digital Commerce**.""
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blythe_Masters
 
DCG is also an investor in BitGo (See ""How it works""). See also: Money map
BitGo aims to become a ""service"" which prevents double spending. I thought Bitcoin had that built in. Well this service is only useful if transactions aren't being confirmed in the blockchain (rather, confirmed in, say, a side-chain, like Lightning--Blockstream's developing technology). Surprise, surprise. SegWit2x would literally take power out of the hands of the miners and gives it to central bankers and MasterCard. Interesting that after the decision to ""suspend"" (does not mean cancel) SegWit2x, Bitcoin gets held hostage by ridiculous transaction times.
 
edit: also worth watching this video from MasterCard before they invested in DCG. Notice this guy is just reading a damn script, too. Smh. Probably doesn't even know what he's saying.

"I agree with some of your points.

CNBC and other mainstream financial news is all just shilling. Normally they shill stocks and bonds. Now they move to cryptos. Don't take them seriously, find your own experts.

I can't understand your logic that Bitcoin does not match the white paper, yet Bitcoin Cash is an altcoin. If Bitcoin does not follow the white paper then it got that way by changing/forking from its original self. Why is it not allowed to fork back to the original plan? If Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash existed from the start, and ended up where they are now, which would be ""Bitcoin"".

Note that I am not in favour or renaming anything or trying to claim the BTC ticker. That will be confusing for everyone at this point. But I believe that the philosophy of Bitcoin Cash is the philosophy of the original Bitcoin.

Comparison to Bitcoin Gold et al doesn't really hold up. Those sought to add new features or change POW. Bitcoin Cash was created to avoid a change (SegWit). The EDA was new but in reality BCH would not have survived without it, and it was only a temporary increase to inflation rate, not a technical change to the transaction mechanism or consensus.

Finally, you don't need to like Roger to like BCH. But if you want to hear what he has to say, I would suggest listening to some of the many podcast interviews he has done. For example: http://dts.podtrac.com/redirect.mp3/ipfs.io/ipfs/QmcnhoCemJ74CydRjJmNpjDpaAAAwnzNm4CiEz2CK4RXVB/VAShow090417.mp3";8;1;False;snowboardinsteve;drj1zbn;My favorite response to the Coinbase BCH launch.;https://i.imgur.com/C0AvlKw.jpg

"The US is pretty much the only country that can pull this shit off. The deeper issue is that moving abroad as a US citizen has become really hard if you don't give up your citizenship because:

- Nobody will give you a bank account/credit card/loan/etc.
- You'll have to do double taxes (and pay the add-on tax of your home country over whatever you get taxed locally), and that's to say nothing of the impossibility of the US tax code and the weeks and weeks you'll need to get all your ducks in a row to be compliant

It's effectively the creation of a banana republic. In the land of the free, you're not free to go where you want to go, and do with your money what you want to do with it. Every step of the way the nanny wants to know what you've been up to and get its cut. And don't you dare consider there is more on this planet than the land of the free, you're not allowed to live there.

"It's a centrally distributed, premined ""coin"" in which the tokens aren't even used in most of the actual deployments that are occurring. Imagine if visa issued a coin that doesn't have anything to do with their payment processing (though to be fair, the token can be used for it, but just frequently isn't by their b2b clients). 

With that said, the tech is pretty solid as a pure transaction system (if you're not looking for a decentralized p2p thing). 

I remember back in the day when they launched and gave everyone on the Bitcoin forums 10000 xrp for free to drum up interest. I've still got a wallet with that somewhere actually. Everyone was calling it a premined scam at the time. Again the tech is solid, but the coins are just bought out of greed (then again so is BTC for the most part so what do I know).

If it does devolve like Bitcoin did, then someone will make a new fork, or you can exchange for something else, just like this time.

Keeping the BCH from the fork is better anyway IMO as you have a built in hedge by holding both BTC and BCH.

"Oh man, don't make me remind myself about when BTC was $4 a coin and I said ""Just buy $200 and sit on it for 3 years"" to myself.

Working paycheck to paycheck... $200 wasn't an option I thought.

C'est la vie.

Point remains though, is this post supposed to be implying the price at $8k, 9k, $3k, or where it'll be in an hour?

Let's leave the scoffing til the dust settles, for a few hours, eh? I'm just mimic'ing the same sort've joke around /r/bitcoin that floats about; e.g. ""My son told me I should give him a Bitcoin. What does he need with $19k anyway? Really, $17k is too much for a young person"" or however that goes.

Enjoy the ride mate, I'm sure it'll be bumpy on the BCH train for the next 12-24 hours. 

Edit: Either way, if guy-in-tweet sold at $668 to BTC... Well, I'm too tired and lazy. What's the comparison on his current gains in BTC versus if he stayed with BCH? Anyone wanna do the math? Nah, that'd just prove his BCH sell was smart... Anywho, downvote away, I'm still gonna be laughing on the shitter tomorrow morning when I check prices of BTC & BCH.

Edit2: Wait Coinbase didn't even allow people to sell BCH? Oh man, watching this all come crashing down is going to be *great*.

"> This is about using real bitcoin. And letting altcoin be altcoin.

If we read the white paper we see that Bitcoin = peer to peer cash.  Segwit coin has said, repeatedly that not only is the white paper wrong, but Segwit/core is a store of value and not a currency.

Another definition, in the white paper is that Bitcoin's very definition is a ""series of signatures.""  Remind me now, what does the acronym SEGWIT stand for?

This, all by itself, makes BTC not bitcoin.  It is now an alt.  And when BCH takes the lead, and it will in time, BCH will be, simply ""Bitcoin"" and BTC will be Bitcoin Core, Bitcoin Segwit or whatever core and blockstream want to call their bastard coin.

your bank account does not earn money when crypto skyrockets. Anyway crypto removes the middleman (banks) from then equation. you are in control of your own money, you don't have to conform to rules and regulations that are imposed by the banks. One can send Bitcoin(cash) back to their family in their home countries with no problem, little to no fees and super fast. They don't have to wait days for their family to receive the funds. That is just the tip of the iceberg brought by the 2008 financial crises.  The banks control your money, You get charged fees for everything,  a fee for overdraws, they limit withdraws etc etc. they can shut down your account for (technical error) which is a hassle to reinstate or freeze your funds for various reasons. Banks sell comfort service like  fraud protection, fdic insurance at a cost of their control. What happens if the market crashes, do you really think the banks will honor their fdic terms when everyone is trying to withdraw cash at once?

">-My debit card is totally free for every transaction

That is somewhat true from the consumer side.  The cost of the transaction is absorbed by the merchant and is realistically passed to the customer through higher item pricing.  

>-My debit transactions are instant

Posted instantly, settled much later in many cases.  This is much like 0-conf except you can expect some settlement security at the first time the transaction is included in a block.

>-My debit card comes with a helpline in case I ever have questions or need assistance

Agreed.  Probably one of the biggest detractors to crypto - If I'm going to ""be my own bank"" then the responsibility is on me.  Of course, you could potentially argue that identity theft is very common.  And on the other hand, crypto is both a payment system and a currency.  Third party credit-providers (and any benefits they may offer) are just as functional with crypto as they are with fiat.

>-My debit card features reversible transactions in case of fraud

Again, that is the customer's perspective.  This can be a risk to the merchant and is also likely included in the price of the item at most retailers.  To counteract this possibility, crypto offers escrowing functionality to reduce the likelihood of either party being dishonest.

>-My debit card features reoccurring payments for ease of subscription transactions

Nothing prohibits this functionality from being built-in to crypto (personal wallets or software can be programmed to schedule payments) or from being offered through a third-party credit services.

>-My Bank is community level, I have never had trust issues with them

Crypto is global, open-source, and ensured by mathematical principals.

>-My money is insured in case anything happens

Again, this is a third-party credit service that can still be offered by crypto.

In general, I would say that it is difficult to wrap your head around the fact that cryptocurrency is both the currency and the payment system.  From a payment perspective, Crypto provides the options to participate in the system on a personal basis (which I can't do with today's SWIFT banking system) without excluding the possibility of credit services (insurance) that many people enjoy from banks / credit cards.  At the same time, the currency properties of crypto allow for a ""stable"" basis for valuation stored within the network.  (I'll admit, crypto is quite young and valuation is quite volatile today.  Thankfully, that is mostly up for now.  And in the future, with global acceptance, it would be much more stable).";20;1;False;Venij;drjh28w;They say we are trying to Kill Bitcoin. No, we are not.

"You've just been mislead, studies have shows even full 4MB blocks 2 years ago wouldn't have harmed decentralization.

[what is decentralization, how does bitcoin get it](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin_Facts/comments/7dp5cn/point_2_decentralization_what_is_it_why_we_have/)


---


Decentralization is one of Bitcoin's main selling points. But what does it actually mean? Skip to the end for the tl;dr

**What is centralization**    
As we all know from reading everything Satoshi wrote about his design for Bitcoin from satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org, Bitcoin was finalized and born in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. In this event many normal people lost money while banking executives made more and more. 

**Where does centralization come from**       
These banks, much like the bank you probably use today, are centralized. That is, they alone control everything that happens. There is one database which has everyone's funds, if they decide you are a terrorist or something they can stop you from access your money. They can stop you from making transactions. Even if you have done nothing wrong they can stop payment on your transactions without your consent, lock you out of your funds, and monitor everything you do. 


**What  is decentralization**       
By splitting up the 'power' that a bank has we decentralize it. There is no longer any one single entity that can control txs and funds. This way no one is 'in charge' and no one can give themselves bonuses while other people lose money. This decentralization is a founding point of Bitcoin.

**Where does decentralization come from**       
Instead of one company controlling the database of funds like in the centralized model, in Bitcoin's decentralized model there are many people who can all contribute to the database and transaction processing without any one entity having full control. In Bitcoin and other POW based cryptocurrencies this decentralization is achieved by having a number of *mining nodes* who are not affiliated. As long as no group of miners controls more than 51% of the hashpower, bitcoin remains decentralized.

---


**So only mining nodes contribute to decentralization, then what about non-mining nodes**      
Non-mining nodes, full nodes, relay nodes, or storage nodes are often misunderstood to be part of decentralization. This can be easily cleared up by understanding the above information and then understanding that a non-mining node has no *power* if the majority of hashpower were to do something they didn't like. 

**I thought everyone was supposed to run a full node**      
This is another common misunderstanding, in the very beginning Satoshi did intend for everyone to run a node with 4 functions. He is very clear when he explains how this is not the way for the system to function in the future. The plan of bitcoin is that everyone can make trustless peer-to-peer transactions on a decentralized system. Not that everyone would run a home server with the whole blockchain. The business and bitcoin companies that need to have personal and instant validation of their tx can run a full nodes. Random sampling is a tried and trusted method, those unable to host their own relay node would be easily able to verify their transactions with overwhelming mathematically certainty.

**So who wants to run a full node then**     
Anyone who wants to can, it's like the Olympics, 'anyone can compete but few feel the need to'. There is no reason the network should be ground to a halt and made useless so people who can't afford to make a transaction would be able to run a full node on a 20 year old computer over a dial up connection. Bitcoin was meant to scale with technology, not become left behind. 


**What are the 4 functions that all early nodes did**       
When you read the design of Bitcoin which we all invested into, the design on which so much was built, the one at nakamotoinstitute.org, you see Satoshi mention the word 'node' many times. What we today call a full node or non-mining node usually fulfills one of those functions, that of storing the database. Finding other peers for connecting to is done by full nodes and pool operators. Sending and receiving bitcoin, aka a wallet, was also a function every node had. Finally generating coins by putting new transactions into the blockchain was the 4th thing all nodes used to do. Today these 4 actions are largely compartmentalized, as they should be in any good computer science project.

This is Bitcoin, some people are unhappy with the way Bitcoin was designed, well I suppose Bitcoin is simply not for those people and they should maybe find something else to do.


I hope you've all learned something today about how Bitcoin is decentralized, what is means, and how we got there.

tl;dr Banks control all txs and accounts with one database and are centralized, Bitcoin has many miners who perform this actions to make it decentralized. Non-mining nodes don't contribute to decentralization. ";8;1;False;siir;drji9dh;They say we are trying to Kill Bitcoin. No, we are not.

My bank account doesnt earn money when its not on the blackjack table either, I want to safeguard my money- not gamble it in crypto

Good luck. Hopefully BTC holds strong for you. I'm personally a bigger fan of ETH, since I'm still not entirely sold on the idea of deflationary currency being used for every day transactions. Seems like as long as it is associated with price increases people are going to view it more as an investment, and be less likely to spend it due to not wanting to be the person who spent a million on pizza.

"I agree with this 100%

Also I'd say another lesson in this is the dangers of censorship.  While it may be tempting at first if you have power over a community to censor.  It's the death of you.  Opposing ideas and discussion is how healthy ideas develop.  You risk idea suicide and insanity and being out of touch with reality when you censor.

Always prefer free discussion to censorship.  Even if that leads to wasteful bickering.  Bickering is better than intellectual death and being out of touch with reality -- which is the real risk that censorship brings. (Aside from it being just morally reprehensible on some level).

"falsehood ? It does.

Satoshi Nakamoto defined Bitcoin as ‚Äúa chain of digital signatures‚Äù.  SegWit assumes that signature data is only needed when transactions are being validated, and can thereafter be discarded as unimportant.

But if most nodes drop the signatures (which is the likely result), the blockchain can only reliably serve as a ledger for worldwide business transactions if:

Some nodes choose to specialize in storing all signature data. This gives those nodes special weight (as a trusted source) to verify and authenticate bitcoin transactions and signatures.  But this is antithetical to the idea of bitcoin as a decentralized, trustless system, with no central authority; 

or

Companies and consumers operating on the blockchain must keep their own copy of transaction records (or their own nodes storing all blockchain transactions with signature data), so they have access to the signature data later if needed for legal proceedings or audits. But this requires massive data duplication and eliminates the efficiencies of using the blockchain as a decentralized ledger.

"> Sadly, all bitcoin users need to do is look at the facts themselves to make their own decision; fees, speed, mempool size, unconfirmed transactions, capacity, potential market... but r/bitcoin makes this hard.

I agree with you.  There are two barriers to that.  One is the poison that is /r/bitcoin.  The other is actually the intellectual barrier -- you really have to spend time understanding stuff and to some of it is intimidating if you come from a different discipline (or worse, no formal academic discipline).

Now -- if /r/bitcoin wasn't so toxic and useless for actual honest intellectuals (real honest people don't even bother going there -- if they haven't been banned yet),, then maybe the barrier to educating people would be somewhat eroded.  A healthy community has experts helping newbies get started.  /r/bitcoin lacks this because experts run away from there like the plague.

"Hey man -- it all depends on what you want to learn to do.  If you want to learn to trade (or just want to buy and HOLD) -- yeah that's a good place to start.  

BCH order book opens up on coinbase ~~tonight at 9 PM~~  at 9 **AM** Pacific time -- so you can start buying BCH right away.  I wouldn't recommend BTC since it's so broken now it requires expert knowledge to transfer it around and is too expensive. Use BCH instead since it works better, especially for newbies.

After you bought some BCH off coinbase -- create a wallet.  I personally use Electron Cash.  http://www.electroncash.org/.

Send your BCH from Coinbase to your Electron Cash wallet.  Then send it back (be sure to create a ""Deposit"" request in Coinbase first before sending it back!).

If you plan on HOLDING for a while -- then make a decision: Are you good about keeping your computer secure and virus free?  Do you trust CoinBase won't go bankrupt in the next 2 years?  If you are good at security and skeptical of exchanges, keep your BCH in your Electron Cash wallet because then it's in your hands and you have 0 risk.  If you trust coinbase and know you suck at security -- then maybe keep it on the exchange.

I personally don't trust exchanges enough to keep it there.  They can always be hacked.  Ideally you hang on to your coins in your wallet and keep your computer secure enough to not worry about it.

That's a good hands-on way to start.  Basically learning how to buy cryptos and how to move them to your hands is 90% what most people want to know how to do.

If you want more background info: You can ask people in here (ask me!) to explain stuff to you.  Also search videos on YouTube that discuss bitcoin and blockchains.  Andreas Antonopolous is a good start as he was the Bitcoin evangelist for years.

Good luck!

"I switched some BTC to BCH via Shapeshift yesterday.  While I was waiting the rate went from more than 8 BCH per BTC down to 5 BCH per BTC.  No way to cancel the trade.

"There are zealots on both sides of the debate.  Doing your own research is really required.

The biggest issue I have with /r/bitcoin right now is the blatant censorship of anything that goes against the party line.  it's very difficult to have a meaningful discussion or debate there, because once you start to make any kind of sense, you post will be deleted, and you will eventually get banned.

The /r/bitcoin community has been curated through banning to include a very large amount of pro Core supporters.  As far as I know /r/btc doesn't ban anyone (unless they legitimately deserve it), so you could have had a rational debate here.  But /r/bitcoin is very condescending to this subreddit, and tells their members to avoid it.

The Core zealots despise BCH with a passion and want to do anything within their means to crush it and permanently kill it.  I will say that the zealots do not reflect the opinion of a vast majority of the people over there.  But they're definitely a very vocal minority.

On the opposite side, the BCH zealots can't wait for Bitcoin Core to die the horrible death they think it deserves.

In my opinion, Lightning Network is untested technology that will get here soon.  Holding the block size hostage for a year is simply insane.  We're losing retailers over high fees.  Steam is forever gone to us.   The fact that the answer the other subreddit gives to Steam is 'Who cares!

"""time"" is very subjective here. what we can say about technology now is totally different from where it was 30 years ago. we couldn't dream of the advances of technology to the point where we can carry a device powerful enough to operate what a room could have done in 1980. 

therefore, the idea is to increase block sizes with more adoption and deal with issues like that with either different ideas or in time when we reach that level of adoption. 

see: sharding, graphene and other technological advances that can accommodate to the original idea of bitcoin.

"I hold almost half a mil in BTC & ETH, can someone please explain to me the benefits of BCH? 

The only times I've had anyone try to sell me on BCH was some dude trying to scam me IRL. Not that BCH had anything to do with him being a scammer, I've just had bad experiences. 

What's all this stuff that I hear about fees, more specifically about how BCH is a cash (no pun intended) grab? Is there any merit to this? 

I'm trying to get a better understanding of BCH, but the last time I considered buying BCH I had a feeling that it was being pumped.. Lo and behold, the price dropped like a brick in a bucket of water. I like that the fees are much lower, but I am still really iffy on it. Any help is appreciated.

"Basically currently, bch's 8mb blocks are never filled so you could put in a tx fee of 1 sat and it will be the same as a 100sat tx fee. This is not the case with btc, as there are over 200k transactions waiting to be sent so paying a 100 sat tx fee will actually give you priority over a 1sat tx fee. You can see here that there's around 1k transactions in the backlog: https://blockchair.com/bitcoin-cash/mempool/transactions and the fees are all around a dollar. 


While btc has over 200k in the backlog: https://blockchain.info/unconfirmed-transactions


And a better comparison of the fees between the 2 where btc costs almost 30 dollars(part of the reason is because the fees are in sats and btc is more expensive):
https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/transactionfees-btc-bch.html#3m

edit: as for transaction times, both btc and bch have similar block times:https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/confirmationtime-btc-bch.html#3m however, bch can handle 8 times more transactions per block, it will be 8 times faster than btc. But because there's less people using bch, there's no line to wait so a confirmation would always take around 10 minutes.";12;2;False;rashaniquah;drigrqn;Everyone on /r/bitcoin/ threatening to leave Coinbase.

"I use this site: https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue, which shows you graphs of the bitcoin ""mempool"" (pool of unconfirmed transactions).

When someone sends a transaction, it gets added to the pool. And every time a miner mines a block, it confirms a number of the highest fee transactions from the top of the graph. When a transaction is confirmed, it is removed from these graphs. For Bitcoin, every block confirms/subtracts 1Mb of transactions. For Bitcoin Cash, every block confirms/subtracts 8Mb of transactions from the mempool.

&nbsp;

If you check the Bitcoin mempool: https://i.imgur.com/qUPkZhU.png

You can see that the only transactions that are getting confirmed over the last 2 weeks are paying 100-140 sat/b, and in the last couple of days as fees have gotten worse and worse, that price has gone up to 300-500 sat/b. At today's BTC value, you have to pay ~$15 USD for your transaction to confirm in a ""reasonable"" time (which still could be hours).

&nbsp;

Compare the Bitcoin Cash mempool: https://i.imgur.com/VzVwxJ3.png

Because Bitcoin Cash uses larger blocks, it's able to confirm a greater number of tx from the mempool every block. So you don't have to compete with so many other users to send your transaction by paying higher and higher fees. As you see from this BCH graph, even 0-5 sat/b transactions are consistently clearing from the mempool. So you can pay ~2 cents for a standard BCH transaction, and it'll get confirmed within 10 minutes.";10;0;False;biggest_decision;driizaa;Everyone on /r/bitcoin/ threatening to leave Coinbase.

I cant shake the feeling that somerhing sketchy/greed for money is going on and crypto newbies fall for it and get reck'd. Thats why I own neither of BTC nor BCH.

"Welcome to /r/btc/ and thanks for the questions.

A Bitcoin block is solved every 10 minutes.  If more miners join the network, the difficulty of solving a block is increased so that the 10 minute interval is always constant.  Also, there is a blocksize limit which restricts the number of transactions that can fit into each block.  That means you can only process that many transactions every 10 minutes.  If there are more transactions being generated around the world then can be processed by the network, you get a growing backlog of stagnant transactions (referred to as the ""mempool"").

A miner gets to choose which transactions he or she includes in the block and receives any fees attached to the transactions included.  This incentivizes inclusion of transactions with the highest fees.  Every block the highest fee transactions get included up until no more can fit, then the rest are left in the mempool.  If transactions are being added faster than they are being processed, the mempool never clears and the fees required to get into a block keep increasing.  This is the current BTC situation.

If you increase the blocksize so that more transactions can fit, you can solve this problem and eventually clear the mempool.  Then miners will include whatever transactions are available even with low fees because they have extra space in every block they mine.  This way, you can get your transactions processed/confirmed in the very next block with very low fees.  This is the current BCH situation.

There is plenty more to discuss on principle and arguments for either side, but I just wanted to try to paint the landscape for you first.";1;0;False;Virulent11;drj1y9t;Everyone on /r/bitcoin/ threatening to leave Coinbase.

"Dang that's a lot to put into just two cryptos. I'd definitely pick up some BCH, since money seems to keep flowing between the two. It's good insurance against BTC.

Advantage of BCH is that it has faster transactions, cheaper fees, and growing merchant adoption.

I'd also go and pick up some other coins like XMR. Probably can't go wrong with going with the top 10 coins, but do your own research, and approach all advice including this one with skepticism. Everyone's got an agenda.

"Totally understandable, and welcome to /r/btc/.  Most everyone here thought BCH was an evil bastard child before we started doing our own research so welcome to the club.  I can post a couple well done videos for you to get you started.  The full explanation is quite dense but basically BTC has added many ""features"" that are intended to be improvements but ultimately undermine the fundamental principles of how Bitcoin works.  BCH applies a very simple scaling strategy by increasing the blocksize and it has been shown that this scaling strategy is sustainable for the entire world population to adopt Bitcoin.  The argument against this form of scaling is ""centralization"" related to hard drive space, CPU power, and internet bandwidth.  However, you will find these arguments are rarely, if ever, backed by facts and data.

There is plenty more to read and learn out there.  Ultimately, I don't want to be the one who tells you how to think.  Dig into concepts like Replace-By-Fee, SegWit, the Lightning Network, etc. and you can judge for yourself how fundamentally sound these features are.

Best of luck to you.

"Depends on which direction you're talking about. The funds need flow *through* the payment channel. Or the channel itself needs to be expanded by additional on-chain transactions. If you've exhausted a channel in the receiving direction, you already control all the funds committed to it. No more funds can flow in your direction on that channel until you push some out or your counter-party commits additional funds to the channel.

If you exhaust a channel in the sending direction, then a liquidity provider, such as an exchange, can top you up by sending funds toward you. This service cost more than just the fee the liquidity provider charges - you'll likely perform it in a non-trustless manner.

"The first question is dependent on a couple of factors. The first one is network speed - block size / 10 minutes = bandwidth required to run a full node. Right now, 8MB blocks work out to less than a hundred kilobits a second, so you're good - but if the blocksize keeps increasing to the point where you need maybe a few megabits a second, or even tens of megabits per second to propagate blocks successfully, people will start getting priced out. The second is disk space. If the 8MB blocks were consistently full, that would work out to about 400 GB of blockchain in one year - still good, but on the fringe. I, for example, have a 1 TB external HDD that I use for storing the blockchain, so within two and a half years of full 8MB blocks I would be priced out of my node unless I was willing to buy a new, larger HDD.

The second question is something we really can't answer, especially in this day and age when things like Moore's law are starting to break down. However, I think the fact that ~85% of today's node-runners could still handle full 8MB blocks is testament to the fact that we were overdue for a blocksize upgrade.";2;2;False;iAmAddicted2R_ddit;drj32dj;Reminder: Core developers used to support 8-100MB blocks before they work for the bankers;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7l0oey/reminder_core_developers_used_to_support_8100mb/

"There are dangers of more centralization and unfairness when mining if you do it with the current p2p network. Mining pools seem to work together to exchange blocks between them very fast, but this extra network needs you to sign up and even if you agree with that as a workaround, is a sort of centralization that others might disagree with.

You might argue that it's not a big deal. I haven't decided on that, but it gives power to the people running said network.

This paper describes the risk of scaling the block size with the current (not a better, future one!!!!) p2p overlay network: www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~prateeks/papers/Bitcoin-scaling.pdf

If you want a rundown: Back when that paper was created (after October 2015), the block size was around 500kb. They took samples to see how fast blocks arrive at 10% of all nodes (not miners), 50% of all nodes, and 90% of all nodes. And then they calculated how long it might take if blocks were 1MB. They found out that with 1MB, it might take 2.4 minutes for a block to propagate to 90% of nodes. If you can expect a block every 10 minutes, that's a pretty big advantage for the 10% who get it within a few seconds (basically over 2 minutes of mining on the current block, whereas the other guys are still mining on top of an old one, and stop when they receive the 2.4 minute old one)

The people who wrote that paper said that 4MB might be fair enough at current network levels, but there's no real security margin in that. Over 4MB (or reduced timings on the blocks) is insecure in their opinion.

Hope that clears up why some people consider a block size increase beyond 2-4MB to be not a good idea right now. Core still wants to increase the block size, btw, but only after these issues are corrected. How do I know?

"I'm just talking about the technology here. Please don't confuse this with me saying Core is always right. This stuff is way too complicated, and if there's new evidence, I reserve the right to change my mind about what course of action was actually the better one.

I'm all for increasing the block size limit once we can have a p2p network (or something equally decentralized/hard to control) that can deliver the blocks to most miners within roughly the same time frame. There's a good chance we will have that in the future (basically only send the header and re-use the transactions in the mempool to build the block yourself. It's not trivial to implement and maybe requires a hard fork, I dunno).

Right now, we don't seem to have it, and I'd rather keep a mostly fair PoW system instead of allowing single actors to get even more of an edge. It really sucks to have high fees or to be unable to even do some transactions, but I'd rather scale securely from a technical perspective than a political one.

If it's 2019 and we still don't see any block size increases on the horizon without new evidence why it's not a good idea even then, I'm sure there will be another fork by other people thinking like me.

"Around 4MB (it's a bit less, but close) block size is possible. Miners decide what transactions they put in their block, so if someone really wanted to, they could do one like that.

As far as I know, a transaction that spends LOTS of really tiny inputs and puts them all in one output (could be a miner helping to clean up the mempool if they accumulated lots of change addresses) could nearly max out to 4MB. That's because the scriptsig (needed to verify your ownership when you add an UTXO as an input) is now in the segregated witness part, and that part is discounted (so it may grow the block to nearly 4MB)";2;2;False;bitcoincashthrowx2;drjhvln;Reminder: Core developers used to support 8-100MB blocks before they work for the bankers;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7l0oey/reminder_core_developers_used_to_support_8100mb/

"It is also commonly spread on this subreddit that core ""backed out"" of the block size increase agreement. This is not true for multiple reasons:

1. Core is a decentralized project, with a decentralized group of contributors. No one person represents core. Ergo no one person can enter in to an agreement for core.

2. The contributors who made a *personal* agreement, only made it to the extent of their ability to work within the common development guidelines of the core project. The guidelines state that in order for code to be merged it must generally have wide acceptance by all contributors, and if deemed prudent, by the greater community as well. The capacity increase proposal failed to meet this criteria. As such the contributor(s) who entered an agreement fulfilled their end of the bargain by proposing the block increase. But they can not force it. That was made clear in [the text of the agreement itself](https://medium.com/@bitcoinroundtable/bitcoin-roundtable-consensus-266d475a61ff).

"Is this sub really about discussing the truth? Because if so I'd like to point out that this post conveniently ignores a couple things with regard to bitcoin core in order to make it's point:

* Raw block size increase are now, and have always been in the [scaling roadmap](https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/capacity-increases) for bitcoin core:

> Delivery on relay improvements, segwit fraud proofs, dynamic
block size controls, and other advances in technology will reduce the risk
and therefore controversy around moderate block size increase proposals
(such as 2/4/8 rescaled to respect segwit's increase). Bitcoin will
be able to move forward with these increases when improvements and
understanding render their risks widely acceptable relative to the
risks of not deploying them.

... but it was thought by most developers that other technologies be developed and implemented first in order to reduce the risks associated with these increases. One such technology improvement was segwit, which was just activated a couple months ago, and leads to the next point:

* [Segwit](https://bitcoincore.org/en/2016/01/26/segwit-benefits/), which was only recently deployed, is an effective doubling of the transaction capacity. Yes, it requires people to use segwit TXs realize the extra capacity, but it is there and available to use. Expect a dramatic jump in segwit TXs once core releases segwit support in the next version, currently under testing and very close to release. Core, being the reference client, can then be used for all other wallets and exchanges as an example for implementation. Once this happens we should see fees come way down.

* [Schnorr signatures](https://bitcoincore.org/en/2017/03/23/schnorr-signature-aggregation/) is another technology currently being developed that will reduce the size of a transaction and therefore increase capacity without the centralizing effects of increasing block size.

* No, the [lightning network](https://lightning.network/) is not 16 months away. It never was. It was always just below the surface waiting for segwit to activate. Now that it is activated, LN development has been progressing at a fast pace. Lightning can provide the capability for virtually unlimited capacity at only pennies per transaction. All tests are passing with the latest builds, and further testing is currently happening with real transactions on the test network. Expect that to conclude within a month or two, and lightning to go live on the main chain early next year.


Finally: 

> Core developers used to support 8-100MB blocks before ....

It's true. These are real quotes. But the suggestion being made by the OP isn't fair. When all these quotes were made, things like schnorr sigs, segwit, and lighting weren't even conceived yet. SO what really happened was that they simply changed their preference in light of new information. You know, something that all smart people do. Something that, unfortunately, the creators of bitcoin cash failed to do. Scaling with block size increases has real drawbacks that you'll generally not see discussed here, and any attempt tends to get downvoted and hidden quickly.";36;7;False;fullstep;drj382f;Reminder: Core developers used to support 8-100MB blocks before they work for the bankers;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7l0oey/reminder_core_developers_used_to_support_8100mb/
"I‚Äôve been reading the past discussions of Core devs because the Cash arguments do have me concerned.  There are two big arguments I see a lot and they both come down to the fact that Core takes Bitcoin very seriously. Like, fate of the world seriously.

One is that ‚Äúhard forks should be hard‚Äù. Core believes that Bitcoin is ruled by consensus and they have a very high bar for consensus. They don‚Äôt mean ‚Äúa majority‚Äù or even a supermajority. I‚Äôve seen strong arguments in favor of no-change against changes that have 90% consensus. That‚Äôs because they don‚Äôt want to alienate 10% of the community today and another 10% later, and another and another until there is nothing left.  Default is no-change until there is practically complete consensus.  That was the issue with Segwit2X.  It‚Äôs not that it was inherently a completely bad idea. It‚Äôs that the S2X team declared ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre gonna go do this now. Join in or don‚Äôt!‚Äù  That‚Äôs not consensus.  Therefore, that‚Äôs a terrible path to go down for the fate of the world.

Two is that decentralization or full nodes is important to maintain strength against very strong counter force.  Bigger blocks won‚Äôt drive up the cost of running full nodes today, or next year, but they will in the coming decades. Today you can run a full node on a very cheap machine. If ten years from now only corporations can afford to run full nodes, then Bitcoin is fucked. Corporations are easy targets for state influence.  Even Google and Amazon bend over for the CIA.  The position of Core is that on-chain scaling simply cannot work at a universal scale.  They believe that side-chain is inevitable.  So, let‚Äôs get it going earlier rather than later.

Frankly, I‚Äôm still digging. On the one hand, I see Cash advocates arguing that it‚Äôs not that hard. And, sometimes even running tests to demonstrate that big blocks can work at large scales.  On the other hand, I‚Äôm an engineer and as such I have spent a lot of my time sniffing technical bullshit. The signal to noise ratio of Core is much, much higher than what I get from Cash. Core guys talk hard, boring, deep tech. Cash guys are much more political.

The blockchain is already 150 gb, and that on only 1 MB blocks. I used to run a full node, but not anymore; my server does not have much storage, and I'd rather use it for movies and music. I imagine that if the blockchain was in the terabytes, more people would have an issue.

"It increases centralization. Right now I can run a full node on my six-year old laptop that has 2 gigs of DDR2 and a 1.6GHz single core CPU, which means that pretty much any living human that is able to use Bitcoin is also able to run a full node. (Well, maybe not a BTC full node right now because of the size of the mempool and UTXO, but in theory.) More full nodes in the hands of independent users means less centralized points of attack and failure - even if only one out of every ten users ran a full node, it would be logistically impossible to ""take down"" Bitcoin or alter the blockchain, because you can't go after every last one of those one out of ten users. 

Blockstream Core says that if the blocksize is allowed to increase vertically as needed, eventually most or all home users like myself will be priced out of running full nodes, which will require industrial-size crypto interests to run nodes so that the blockchain continues to propagate, increasing centralization (if one of those interests is attacked, goes insolvent, or goes rogue, that's problematic).

[Digital Currency Group](http://dcg.co/who-we-are/) owns (in part) and directs [Blockstream](http://dcg.co/portfolio/) (go to ""B"" and look 13 down). Guess who runs Digital Currency Group:
 
1. Glenn Hutchins: Former Advisor to President Clinton. Hutchins sits on the board of **The Federal Reserve Bank of New York**, where he was reelected as a Class B director for a three-year term ending December 31, 2018.
 
2. Barry Silbert: CEO of Digital Currency Group, (**funded by Mastercard**) who is also an Ex investment Banker at Houlihan Lokey. This is the guy who thought SW2x was a good idea.
 
3. Lawrence H. Summers: ""Board Advisor""
""**Chief Economist at the World Bank from 1991 to 1993**. In 1993, Summers was appointed **Undersecretary for International Affairs of the United States Department of the Treasury under the Clinton Administration**. In 1995, he was promoted to **Deputy Secretary of the Treasury** under his long-time political mentor Robert Rubin. In 1999, he succeeded Rubin as **Secretary of the Treasury**. While working for the Clinton administration Summers played a leading role in the American response to the 1994 economic crisis in Mexico, the 1997 Asian financial crisis, and the Russian financial crisis. He was also **influential in the American advised privatization of the economies of the post-Soviet states [a massive FUD campaign that caused Russian citizens to sell their shares in public companies - these shares were purchased by Oligarch bankers with ties to Western Banks and most Russian people had their national resources stolen from them]**, and in the **deregulation of the U.S financial system, including the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act**.""
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Summers
 
4. Blythe Masters: ""Former executive at JPMorgan Chase.[1] She is currently the CEO of Digital Asset Holdings,[2] a financial technology firm developing distributed ledger technology for wholesale financial services.[3] Masters is **widely credited as the creator of the credit default swap as a financial instrument**. She is also Chairman of the Governing Board of the Linux Foundation‚Äôs open source Hyperledger Project, member of the **International Advisory Board of Santander Group**, and **Advisory Board Member of the US Chamber of Digital Commerce**.""

DCG is also an investor in BitGo (See ""How it works""). See also: Money map
BitGo aims to become a ""service"" which prevents double spending. I thought Bitcoin had that built in. Well this service is only useful if transactions aren't being confirmed in the blockchain (rather, confirmed in, say, a side-chain, like Lightning--Blockstream's developing technology). Surprise, surprise. SegWit2x would literally take power out of the hands of the miners and gives it to central bankers and MasterCard. Interesting that after the decision to ""suspend"" (does not mean cancel) SegWit2x, Bitcoin gets held hostage by ridiculous transaction times.
 
edit: also worth watching this video from MasterCard before they invested in DCG. Notice this guy is just reading a damn script, too. Smh. Probably doesn't even know what he's saying.

decentralization is their main argument and it's totally flase, non mining nodes don't contribute to decentrlization.

Decentralization is one of Bitcoin's main selling points. But what does it actually mean? Skip to the end for the tl;dr

**What is centralization**    
As we all know from reading everything Satoshi wrote about his design for Bitcoin from satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org, Bitcoin was finalized and born in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. In this event many normal people lost money while banking executives made more and more. 

**Where does centralization come from**       
These banks, much like the bank you probably use today, are centralized. That is, they alone control everything that happens. There is one database which has everyone's funds, if they decide you are a terrorist or something they can stop you from access your money. They can stop you from making transactions. Even if you have done nothing wrong they can stop payment on your transactions without your consent, lock you out of your funds, and monitor everything you do. 


**What  is decentralization**       
By splitting up the 'power' that a bank has we decentralize it. There is no longer any one single entity that can control txs and funds. This way no one is 'in charge' and no one can give themselves bonuses while other people lose money. This decentralization is a founding point of Bitcoin.

**Where does decentralization come from**       
Instead of one company controlling the database of funds like in the centralized model, in Bitcoin's decentralized model there are many people who can all contribute to the database and transaction processing without any one entity having full control. In Bitcoin and other POW based cryptocurrencies this decentralization is achieved by having a number of *mining nodes* who are not affiliated. As long as no group of miners controls more than 51% of the hashpower, bitcoin remains decentralized.

---


**So only mining nodes contribute to decentralization, then what about non-mining nodes**      
Non-mining nodes, full nodes, relay nodes, or storage nodes are often misunderstood to be part of decentralization. This can be easily cleared up by understanding the above information and then understanding that a non-mining node has no *power* if the majority of hashpower were to do something they didn't like. 

**I thought everyone was supposed to run a full node**      
This is another common misunderstanding, in the very beginning Satoshi did intend for everyone to run a node with 4 functions. He is very clear when he explains how this is not the way for the system to function in the future. The plan of bitcoin is that everyone can make trustless peer-to-peer transactions on a decentralized system. Not that everyone would run a home server with the whole blockchain. The business and bitcoin companies that need to have personal and instant validation of their tx can run a full nodes. Random sampling is a tried and trusted method, those unable to host their own relay node would be easily able to verify their transactions with overwhelming mathematically certainty.

**So who wants to run a full node then**     
Anyone who wants to can, it's like the Olympics, 'anyone can compete but few feel the need to'. There is no reason the network should be ground to a halt and made useless so people who can't afford to make a transaction would be able to run a full node on a 20 year old computer over a dial up connection. Bitcoin was meant to scale with technology, not become left behind. 


**What are the 4 functions that all early nodes did**       
When you read the design of Bitcoin which we all invested into, the design on which so much was built, the one at nakamotoinstitute.org, you see Satoshi mention the word 'node' many times. What we today call a full node or non-mining node usually fulfills one of those functions, that of storing the database. Finding other peers for connecting to is done by full nodes and pool operators. Sending and receiving bitcoin, aka a wallet, was also a function every node had. Finally generating coins by putting new transactions into the blockchain was the 4th thing all nodes used to do. Today these 4 actions are largely compartmentalized, as they should be in any good computer science project.

This is Bitcoin, some people are unhappy with the way Bitcoin was designed, well I suppose Bitcoin is simply not for those people and they should maybe find something else to do.


I hope you've all learned something today about how Bitcoin is decentralized, what is means, and how we got there.

 * increased attack surface
 * harder to get new debvs
 * harder to get new invetors as the plan is more complex
 * harder to add new features as they have to deal with all the added and convluted code

"speed modifier is a % of max speed and uses calculation below where utx is number of unconfirmed tx and ntx is number of tx in last block.

speed = max * (1 - utx/ntx/100)

there's also a condition set so minimum speed is never below 10% of max speed.

Because BCH usually clears all unconfirmed transactions when block is found, it's always at max speed (or 99.99% of it).";3;1;False;porlybe;drimo9b;this is the COOLEST visualisation of BTC / BCH comparison i have seen so far - the tax highway !;http://txhighway.com/#

Yeah I'm one of the devs. I agree, min car speed is probably set too low, maybe should only be half speed instead of almost stationary.

Car speed should not be configured and should represent average speed of transactions confirmed.
Since there are too many transactions to show them all, maybe they should be grouped by 2,3,4,... (that could be configurable). If the group is by 3, you would see the huge truck every 3 huge transactions for instance.

If the network confirmed 3 transactions per second, with group of 3, 1 car per second should enter and leave the screen.

With BTC, transactions do arrive faster than they get confirmed, so the default speed includes some room for temporary queue.

"Fair enough - I see what you are saying. Well, *long term*, I still think hash power is the defining factor - it has to be.

I called BCH a ""silent majority fork"" and I think it is: The majority of hashpower stands behind it, but still milks BTC for all it is worth.

Without the hashpower majority *protecting* BCH, it would not have gotten off the ground without being attacked IMO.

But everyone knows that trying to double-spend BCH blocks is pointless: Anyone who tries will feel the wrath of those miners that are long BCH.
