Your assertion that Gavin plotted to create a false Satoshi hoping that nobody would insist on proof, to back him up on the block size issue, is moronic.;1;1;False;forgoodnessshakes;d2w7975;Gavin, we still love you for all that you do.;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4i2oms/gavin_we_still_love_you_for_all_that_you_do/
"> I suspect you were almost convinced before speaking to me, and now you are thoroughly convinced. 

You're wrong. I was unsure when Gavin said he is convinced, even after talking to him, was about 70% convinced after listening to Craig's interviews and reading up on some follow up information, and am less than 50% convinced at this point. I was never ""almost convinced"" or ""thoroughly convinced."" At best all I can say is ""I don't know.""

I just believe you even less because of your accusations of Gavin based on pretty much nothing. You obviously don't even know him. Mostly it's cause of stuff like this:

> even though he already knew that the signature was forged and copied from the blockchain

Where's your proof he knew? Where's your proof he was in on it?

> He certainly knew by the time he began tweeting

Where's your proof that he knew? You do remember that all this happened in a span of a few days, during which Gavin was traveling and attenting Consensus 2016?

> Wright was Satoshi is what Gavin supposedly saw..

And John, and Ian Grigg

> Gavin is lying.

And I'm dismissing your claim because you have nothing to support it with besides your very obvious dislike of Gavin.";1;1;False;Rassah;d2vpaue;Gavin, we still love you for all that you do.;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4i2oms/gavin_we_still_love_you_for_all_that_you_do/
"Sounds good.  The list of people who were taken by Gavin is fairly long.  Many of them are coming to his defense for long enough to distance themselves with minimal embarrassment.  However, there are a few who still do not realize they've been had.  You are on the short list.

I'm one of those people who hates to see people scammed.  I hate it even more when it's done to the detriment of my holdings.  Accordingly, I've done my part in making the list as short as possible (even you guys will remain more guarded).  But I can't win them all.  You'll likely endure further disappointment.  But at least your numbers have dwindled to where Gavin's influence is minimal.";1;1;False;Lejitz;d2vq34b;Gavin, we still love you for all that you do.;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4i2oms/gavin_we_still_love_you_for_all_that_you_do/
"> I'm one of those people who hates to see people scammed

Interestingly enough, I was not scammed, and Gavin was scammed out of $5

My main complaint is shitting on Gavin who has done more for Bitcoin that anyone besides Satoshi, based on accusations made by people who obviously don't even know him.

"Being scammed does not have to involve losing money.  For instance, the short list You are a part of believe Gavin got scammed into vouching for Wright.  That you are playing with semantics suggests you too are not really on the short list.  Have fun trying to vouch for Gavin.  The mainstream media has gotten ahold of this and they are reporting fairly accurately.  The disinterested see this for exactly what it is; Gavin is vouching for a scammer, which implicates him as a scammer.  https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/06/bitcoin-project-blocks-out-gavin-andresen-over-satoshi-nakamoto-claims

You might want to reconsider your chosen route and openly distance yourself.  I'll still remember that you were willing to go along with Gavin, but most will never know.  There's a right side to be on in all of this, and you are not on it.";2;1;False;Lejitz;d2vyjx3;Gavin, we still love you for all that you do.;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4i2oms/gavin_we_still_love_you_for_all_that_you_do/
">is moronic.

I see you have nothing intelligent to say.  Fortunately, it seems the unbiased will agree with me.

https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/06/bitcoin-project-blocks-out-gavin-andresen-over-satoshi-nakamoto-claims

This mainstream article paints the clearest of picture: Gavin is insisting that a phony is the creator of Bitcoin.  Accordingly, he has lost his prominence for trying to scam the world.  Tisk tisk.

Have fun calling the rest of the world morons.  Different versions of the same story will propagate and the at-large public will draw the only reasonable conclusion; Gavin was up to no good.
