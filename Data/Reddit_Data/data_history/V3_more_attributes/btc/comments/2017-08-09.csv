"Erik you were one of the first people I heard speak on the subject in early 2013 that made me realise how profound an invention Bitcoin was.  Thanks for building Shapeshift and everything else you have done.

Your decision to sell your BCH is honorable in the light of the NYA which I do hope creates a strong path forward for Bitcoin.  However I suspect, a bumpy road with those ideologically opposed to larger blocks.

If the way forward on the legacy fork ossifies as I fear it will, I am sure you will be welcome with open arms on the Bircoin Cash fork or whichever crypto steps into the void.

"I did notice that you're defending the 2x deal to the best of your ability over at r/bitcoin, that's very honorable of you, however seeing the reactions, you are fighting a losing battle (not that r/bitcoin would be necessarily representative of BTC community as a whole, but still, it's a good&influential chunk of it).

But you may perhaps consider the point many are making - that Bitcoin Cash has obsoleted the need for that compromise, the community has already split and the Segwit2x compromise is not going to put it together anymore. Segwit proponents do not want 2x, big block supporters do not want SegWit and 2x is too little too late for them anyway - SegWit2x upsets both camps. It's perhaps better now that big blockers have split that everybody gets exactly what they want and let the market decide which one wins long term (or if they can coexist).

I obviously support Cash, I consider many individuals at the Core side plain toxic. Since the split, I registered substantial improvement in the atmosphere on this sub, people are joyful again, able to ignore the antics of people they vehemently disagree with, it reminds me of the early days. There are still plenty of jabs at Core but that's going to vane over time as we focus on future protocol and code improvements.

Bitcoin Cash is going to get the improvements that SegWit provides in due time, now that the most pressing issue of capacity is resolved. It just isn't going to be called SegWit and won't be a overcomplicated mess that SF SegWit is, it's going to be clean technically superior solution, perhaps FlexTrans or something else.

What I'm saying is, maybe you should seriously consider dropping he 2x part of the agreement and perhaps the crypto world will be better for it.";9;0;False;mushner;dldemyn;Overstock.com now accepts Bitcoin Cash via ShapeShift integration;http://fortune.com/2017/08/08/overstock-digital-currency/\
Myself and ShapeShift are fully committed to SegWit2x. We support SegWit, and we support conservatively larger blocks. Most importantly, we support anything that brings the feuding tribes together, because there are bigger fights to win ahead. ;3;0;False;evoorhees;dlcv0qq;Overstock.com now accepts Bitcoin Cash via ShapeShift integration;http://fortune.com/2017/08/08/overstock-digital-currency/\
