"Love it! One request though. Please start aliging the B mark straight up. There are two reasons for this: 

1) BCH is bitcoin designed to actually be USED as a currency, and as such it's mark should follow typographical norms. No other currency mark is crooked. 

2) Coreons like to complain that we are being misleading any chance they get, and the BTC logo is crooked.

"That's cool. 

This is not a critique of your work but I'll share some observation on the subject.  I'm so sick and tired of seeing a B inside a circle as though it ever was a round coin. It actually has nothing to do with a geometric shape, and considering that it has eight decimal places, that's super super high resolution! compared to jaunty Dollars and sense Bitcoin is like liquid, liquid money. 

For example, whenever you pay with dollars and cents you give the cashier too much money! Almost every time you give the cashier too much money! And then he gives you back a little bit of money, your change.

That's very silly! it's an example of something silly that we're used to because everyone has known it since they were a child. the more logical thing is to pay exactly the right amount every single time , down to the finest Element of value, down to eight decimal places. With Bitcoin you can do that. One transaction only. You don't have to wait for a rebound transaction to get your "" ""change."" there is no need because there is no such thing. Why should there be.

Anyway, a very good creative challenge (if you're in the mood) would be to kill the silly round B. The visual concept is not doing anyone any good.";5;1;False;LuxuriousThrowAway;e2qiz94;I've been practicing some 3D animation with your logo;https://v.redd.it/3v6wpnd664b11
