You should be cautious. If your data ends up in the wrong hands, than they can buy cars, houses and other expensive and illegal stuff on your name. You will get arrested for something you haven't done. And a heap of shit will follow.  You don't want that.. So f*ck them if they want your social security number. Internet is a dangerous place.  The watermark is there, so they can't copy your photo. So make sure you do that to. Identity theft is a pain in the butt if you have to deal with it. ;2;0;False;Jackal000;e05ch4r;This is reason enough to avoid verifying accounts on exchanges.

I don't know if it's true or not. Just something I found on Twitter, but the point remains. Giving a random entity, like a sketch as fuck exchange, my personal information seems like a huge risk...one that is unnecessary.  ;0;0;False;crypto-anarchist86;e051923;This is reason enough to avoid verifying accounts on exchanges.

I understand, make a new name, be orginal instead of confusing everyone and cashing in on the same name that a cryptocurrency currently uses.;1;1;False;nerdyviking12;e0624s2;BCH will soon be added to tens of thousands of convenience stores in Japan!;https://twitter.com/BitcoinCom/status/1003234920590962688
Yes, the name is Bitcoin Cash. The whole point of the fork is that our vision for bitcoin is no longer held back by yours. That means we don’t have to listen to what you think anymore. It doesn’t matter if you don’t like the name. Just like it doesn’t matter that you don’t understand bitcoin and don’t think it can scale. It can and it will. And you’re just going to have to deal with it. Sorry. ;1;0;False;CatatonicAdenosine;e064bkh;BCH will soon be added to tens of thousands of convenience stores in Japan!;https://twitter.com/BitcoinCom/status/1003234920590962688
