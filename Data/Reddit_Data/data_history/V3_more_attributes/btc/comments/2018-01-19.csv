I agree with most of what you said EXCEPT the privacy part. I'll give one example and I encourage you to think more deeply on the subject. Imagine you go to a movie theater, and pay for your ticket in BTC or bch or LTC or any clear coin. Now, today, tools to track actual WALLETS are mostly only used by governments, but those tools already exist. Let's say in an effort to maximize profit, this movie theater implements one of these tools. Ok so you go up to the line, pay for your ticket, and go to buy popcorn or candy. Since they know where that money came from, and the tool they have allows them to pretty much map all your activity on the blockchain, they can get a pretty good idea of how much money you have in whatever crypto you paid them in, how often you move money around, what amounts are involved, etc. They don't need your entire, intact financial history, because what they're doing is basically just guessing at how much money you have, and thus how price sensitive you are. They can charge higher prices to you, and expect that you'll pay them, because they know you have a lot more money than most other people. That's a problem. A lot of people agree that it's a problem, but either don't think it's possible, or there's not enough incentive for businesses to implement a strategy like this. Both of these objections are unfounded. It is possible for me to personally comb through someone's wallet history on the blockchain, and have a decent idea of their financial footprint. It is getting much, much easier for AI and machine learning to take this to the next level, essentially turning these fractured efforts at individual deanonymization into a big Sudoku game. KYC/AML ensures they have enough numbers to start, and it's not very difficult to fill in the rest. This is already happening, and companies like elliptic and chainalysis are refining their methods everyday. As for the incentives of the movie theater, they don't have to tell you what they're doing, because it's not an invasion of privacy. You put that information into the public domain, and so there it is, forever. ;1;1;False;BifocalComb;dsxngmb;Death of a Scamcoin: r/Bitconnect's front page screenshotted moments before they went private, showing panic, anger, and lots of ill-advised investment claims, several claiming to have lost over $100k;https://imgur.com/a/TLimM

"**Champagne**

Champagne (French: [ʃɑ̃.paɲ]) is a type of sparkling wine and type of an alcoholic drink produced from grapes grown in the Champagne region of France following rules that demand, among other things, secondary fermentation of the wine in the bottle to create carbonation, specific vineyard practices, sourcing of grapes exclusively from specific parcels in the Champagne appellation and specific pressing regimes unique to the region. Most people use the term Champagne as a generic term for sparkling wine, but in many countries, it is illegal to label any product Champagne unless it both comes from the Champagne region and is produced under the rules of the appellation.



Primarily, the grapes Pinot Noir, Pinot Meunier, and Chardonnay are used in the production of almost all Champagne, but a tiny amount of pinot blanc, pinot gris, arbane, and petit meslier are vinified as well. Champagne appellation law allows only grapes grown according to appellation rules in specifically designated plots within the appellation to be used in the production of champagne.

"> He pretty much singlehandedly turned the rbitcoin community against segwit2x.

I disagree. I think this was the work of some PR agency. The same that did UASF likely did NO2X as far as I can see.

I suspect this might be seen in retrospective as that one major mistake of old money that might upend the old financial order.

Up to and including the S2X part, they had their hooks in the system and a good chance of controlling and shepherding it.

"> He [Gregory Maxwell] also created the (pretty much baseless as far as I have been able to find) idea that bitmain opposed segwit based on ASICBOOST.

After a few weeks of spreading that accusation and threatening that he (Gregory Maxwell) would personally write the source code to change the protocol rules to disable the possibility of covert Asicboost, Jihan Wu (co-founder of Bitmain and Antpool) tweeted that if Gregory Maxwell would write the code to disable the possibility for covert Asicboost, then Jihan Wu and Antpool would vote yes to activate that code. Then suddenly Gregory Maxwell stopped talking about Asicboost and never created any such code. 

If even Jihan Wu would vote yes to activate such code, then why didn't Gregory Maxwell write and release such code? It's likely because the effect of using Asicboost was too small to matter and Gregory knew it but chose to pretend that he didn't know it, as political retaliation against Jihan Wu for voting no for Segwit and yes for a bigger base blocksize limit.";26;1;False;todu;dswt7a9;Blockstream is falling apart - Greg Maxwell resigns - Blockstream takes down team page in a hurry to reorg team - Adam Back must be worried;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7rfog0/blockstream_is_falling_apart_greg_maxwell_resigns/

"I think your reasoning applies just fine to gold: gold had non-monetary uses (such as jewelry) which helped bootstrap it into position as a medium of indirect exchange. But also has plenty of non-monetary uses today which bolster its effectiveness as a store of value.

Importantly, having a widely accepted medium of indirect exchange is an economic good, in and of itself.  This is what most people miss: the good ceases to be just the token, but rather, the network of trading partners as a whole. That is the qualitative shift which occurs when something becomes a money.  There's no need for the value of the token to be recursive, nor is there conflict with or need for special, historical reasons why gold is primarily a store of value, though those do play a role, no doubt.

Bitcoin tokens are not typically valued for their *bling!* factor, nor do they have many other obvious non-monetary uses or utilities...but what they can serve as right now is a share of a valuable, censorship-resistant payment network; which helps bootstrap that token to be widely held and demanded enough- such that it forms a vast network of trading partners; a medium of indirect exchange. And the good itself becomes this, rather than just the token; and this then feeds back on its utility as store of value, just like with gold.";1;0;False;kwanijml;dsxifum;Blockstream is falling apart - Greg Maxwell resigns - Blockstream takes down team page in a hurry to reorg team - Adam Back must be worried;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7rfog0/blockstream_is_falling_apart_greg_maxwell_resigns/

The you've never understood the big block argument : worldwide adoption via cheap fees creates MORE revenue for miners because of the sheer volume of cheap tx's.

Likewise, there's no reason to suggest he's changed his original vision, especially given that non full blocks was the norm until recently that got us to here.

Look, no one is against innovation, especially LN. But to cripple onchain scaling while we need it most and to give LN pumpers time to maybe get it to work is just stupid.

"Well, miners can't get all the fees if they can't process all transactions (big mem pool). They can make more money though, if there's a big backlog. So I don't get your point? I thought BCH was for big blocks to prevent a big mem pool full of transactions. Hence making less money for the miners... 

And we don't know what Staoshi's vision is at the moment, as we didn't get any news since 2013 (?).  It's like saying that anyone can have a gun in the USA because of the constitution, but not taking into account that the constitution was written some hundred years ago when guns could fire 1 shot each 10 minutes. 

That being said, technology gets more complex to be simpler for end users. That's what happened to the Internet and technological equipment in general. It didn't became simpler, it became more complex on the engineering side. You need complex machine to make tiny complex parts that can fit in a tiny phone... you can watch a video on a tiny device now.. and it's not because it's 'simpler' than what phones were before.

The blockchain is the same IMO. In the future, it'll get harder and harder to just update the block size and keep up with demand. You need something more complex. But here's the thing, the block size and transaction pool isn't the only problem here. Crypto in general is not usable for normal average users (my grandma will never be able to use that in its current state). It's also way too volatile to make sense to use as an every day transaction system and it's hard to use securely and not lose money. So all these problems will need to be fixed too.

If a company were producing something that provided no utility, and selling it, I would honestly consider that the result of malinvestment, and therefore under the purview of a bubble type scenario. The reason I didn't answer your question is because a company isn't producing and selling bitcoin, it's a currency. Sure, the ones who already own it want to get more people into it, to make money, but that's true of stocks and every other asset class, too. That Bitcoin provides NO utility isn't true, it certainly is useful in some situations. If it did literally nothing, like bitconnect, I'd agree, but it's simply worse technology than other cryptos employ, not useless technology.

Who do you think core is? How can you imagine they have an opinion or have forced anyone to think anything? It's an open organization of hundreds of people. If you were to argue it has a leader there is no compelling argument that leader is blockstream, it would have to be an argument that Wladimir as the principle maintainer is. I don't recall him or Core as an organization ever trying to make anyone think anything. I recall about 4 outspoken devs trying to convince a lot of people of things on one side of the debate and 2 on the other. Core as an organization didn't do or endorse anything, these are just people pushing their own views.

"You're absolutely right (and I've spent years trying to show bitcoiners this as well as the positive future implications)...but it is also true that neither bitcoin cash, nor any other cryptocurrency that I'm aware of, are very good stores of value...if only for the price volatility which means that we can't reliably or predictably retrieve value from the token at a future time.

Most all cryptos are currently: decent media of exchange, poor stores of value, and don't serve as unit-of-account, at all, for any significant economic sphere.

This makes the critiques and criticisms of economists about cryptocurrencies not being good currencies, valid....right now.

But it portends great potential future utility and qualitative change in the nature of the role that cryptocurrencies serve in the future, [if we understand how money forms on a market](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6u14b3/why_bitcoin_is_the_way_that_it_is_or_how_i).

It also gives us the more correct perspective on which side of the scaling debate to land on: when we understand the coordination problems, we properly prioritize on-chain payments utility as being fundamental to the process of bootstrapping a money into position as, not only medium of exchange, but good store of value, and ultimately, unit of account.

If the token does not become actualized money...we're just building an inefficient proxy currency for fiat.

TL;DR all three roles of money are somewhat complementary and self-reinforcing: you can't build a good ""store of value"" out of something like a crypto-token (which has little use-value except as a means of indirect exchange) without it also being a good medium of exchange.";2;1;False;kwanijml;dsxerq9;Blockstream is falling apart - Greg Maxwell resigns - Blockstream takes down team page in a hurry to reorg team - Adam Back must be worried;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7rfog0/blockstream_is_falling_apart_greg_maxwell_resigns/

The only ones complaining have been the small blockers who don't even mine.

"To begin with, you can't store value in something that doesn't retain its value over time.

In order to retain value over time, it must have a somewhat constant price.

In order to have a somewhat constant price, there must be a supply and demand in rough equilibrium.

In order for supply and demand to be in rough equilibrium, there must be a primary demand driver that is _not_ the store of value, for if it is, the store of value will fail at such time when many people want to take out the utility from the store, or just when no more people want to store value. In other words, such a ""store of value"" will only function until all the world's people have stored their value, at which point it collapses.

Therefore, a commodity can never primarily be a store of value. It can only be a store of value as a _secondary_ function of a primary utility that drives demand.

Then someone said that he should leave blockstream (I don't see the connection, but whatever). Then he left blockstream and wrote an email about 2 months (?) later. Then you say that it's like he admitted that he hacked accounts. 

Wow, you guys really go deep into one conspiracy leading to another, at some point you'll prove that Jesus is the one that created BCH?

"Full text of the resignation:

> Not really all that on-topic, but since it was suggested to me that this would be an efficient venue to reach others who might care to know: In order to spend more time working independently on deep protocol work, especially new cryptographic privacy and security technology for Bitcoin, I resigned from Blockstream last November. It took until the end of December to wind down my involvement there. Back when we founded the company I was concerned that there was significant underinvestment in Bitcoin technology: Bitcoin had a healthy technical community just as it does today, but lacked the kind of industry support that projects like Linux have. Without sustained financial support, some kinds of bigger projects seemed really hard to pull off with developers needing to share time between non-bitcoin employment, their families, and their other interests. For the most part, back then early Bitcoin companies weren't investing in public technology, at least not effectively. We hoped that Blockstream could help act as an anchor of support for technology development, and in doing so help grow the community. I think that has been a big success. The Bitcoin industry has matured a lot and today Bitcoin Core gets significant regular contributions from many organizations (including Chaincode, DCI, Blockstream, Coinbase, Bitmain, Blockchain, and probably others that I am forgetting or not even aware of) and a volunteer community much larger and more active than it has ever been before. From what I've been told Blockstream plans to continue to contribute to awesome technology in Bitcoin--as demonstrated by their Lightning webstore this week--but if they didn't, that wouldn't be a problem for Bitcoin. So for me this means that I can go back to working on the things I find most exciting ... without the overhead of managing staff or dealing with the many non-Bitcoin blockchain applications which are important to Blockstream's business. The maturing Bitcoin industry means I don't need to worry that Bitcoin development could be left with inadequate financial support. I'm very excited about all the new and interesting technology that is coming to production--Bulletproofs / CT, signature aggregation, improved propagation and synchronization--as well as the continuing maturation of Bitcoin as a viable subject matter for academic researchers. I'll be spending more time helping with these and other things, and will no longer have insight into Blockstream's activities or a Blockstream email address (I can continue to be reached at my xiph.org and gmail email addresses as I've used here in the past), but otherwise this shouldn't change anything for anyone here.";12;1;False;infcoin;dswspez;Blockstream is falling apart - Greg Maxwell resigns - Blockstream takes down team page in a hurry to reorg team - Adam Back must be worried;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7rfog0/blockstream_is_falling_apart_greg_maxwell_resigns/

"The November date is interesting. I have a hypothesis that may or may not have merit to it. Could it be that Greg was ousted by Blockstream investors after campaigning against Segwit2x, directly precipitating the unfolding disaster we have seen play out as BTC becomes unusable. All the major Bitcoin businesses, including Blockstream, are funded by the Digital Currency Group that brokered the Segwit2x agreement in the first place. All these businesses are struggling to deal with Segwit1x's high fees and congested blocks. Grayscale, the Bitcoin Investment Trust guys were forced by the terms of their listing on the stock market to choose either BCH or BTC to continue holding and liquidate the rest. This would have been less of an issue if the community could have prevented a schism and rallied around Segwit2x. Instead though the rejection of Segwit2x by Core has left the community fractured and leaves the possibility of a rally occurring around the technologically superior fork of Bitcoin (BCH). 

/u/JustSomeBadAdvice [documents here](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7ktnth/thoughts/drhhpt4/) how Segwit2x was very popular until Greg Maxwell came out against it. To me Segwit2x represented the absolute victory of one company in DCG's portfolio over every one else and that company was Blockstream. Possibly that could have resulted in a backlash from Blockstream investors who also invested in the broader Bitcoin ecosystem, and maybe that led to Greg Maxwell's ouster.

This is all just speculation on my part. Any number of other theories may be equally plausible or more plausible.";50;4;False;Zectro;dswnzwu;Blockstream is falling apart - Greg Maxwell resigns - Blockstream takes down team page in a hurry to reorg team - Adam Back must be worried;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7rfog0/blockstream_is_falling_apart_greg_maxwell_resigns/

"It's being naive because most people will ~~right~~ write a resignation letter like that no matter the real reason they quit.

Many high ranking employees leave a dumpster fire of a company and issue out a nice resignation letter.  Usually you need to read between the lines or wait and see what the person's future actions are to find out the real reasons they left.

Maxwell wrote he left Blockstream to work on Bitcoin.  Shouldn't he have had more power/influence on making Bitcoin better from his role within Blockstream?

"Coinbase is just a company. They can scheme all they want. What do I care? As Bitcoin demonstrates repeatedly no company can dictate it's direction.

Roger is in BCH because he genuinely believes provably false things like that Bitcoin has been taken over, and all his experience in how business works shapes the way he thinks about Bitcoin adoption and potential failure. Wu is in it because there is a financial incentive for him to be in it.

It's also worth noting it is provable Bitcoin and BCH have been attacked by similar ""spam"" attacks, which you are right aren't really spam they are paid for. The reason it's considered hostile is that in both instances blocks are being filled by transactions with hundreds of tiny inputs and fees multiples greater than the total being transacted - i.e. transactions designed specifically to be large and expensive while accomplishing no real transfer of value. Kind of amazing there is a system where consuming available resources the way a DDoS attack might ends up reinforcing the security model through high fees without actually denying service.

The biggest issue with these conspiracy theories, primarily those here, is they ignore the only real information that can be used to draw conclusions - git history and onchain data. They would rather rely on convoluted social ""evidence"", often grossly misconstrued, to support their preconceived conspiracy while ignoring any hard public data which refutes them.

It might be true that there are lunatics in every camp, but Bitcoin shed more than a few with the creation of these forks.";1;0;False;MrRGnome;dswqau6;Blockstream is falling apart - Greg Maxwell resigns - Blockstream takes down team page in a hurry to reorg team - Adam Back must be worried;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7rfog0/blockstream_is_falling_apart_greg_maxwell_resigns/

Blockstream's somewhat unofficial business plan very likely depends on most people being forced to use LN / sidechains instead of being allowed to keep using Bitcoin on-chain directly (with low transaction fees). It doesn't matter if Blockstream invented LN or not and it doesn't matter how many or few direct LN developers they have in-house. They still built their business around LN / sidechains and are likely planning on becoming a first-mover advantage big LN hub that collects LN transaction fees that would otherwise have gone to the miners. Or maybe profiting from sidechain transaction fees somehow or in a similar manner.;5;1;False;todu;dswv93v;Blockstream is falling apart - Greg Maxwell resigns - Blockstream takes down team page in a hurry to reorg team - Adam Back must be worried;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7rfog0/blockstream_is_falling_apart_greg_maxwell_resigns/

Most of the developers want to do it in a conservative way, with the real long term scaling being done through layered solutions.  I wish it would all happen faster, but both onchain and off chain scaling is a part of pretty much everyone's long term plan.;-4;0;False;xxDan_Evansxx;dsxdvf5;Blockstream is falling apart - Greg Maxwell resigns - Blockstream takes down team page in a hurry to reorg team - Adam Back must be worried;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7rfog0/blockstream_is_falling_apart_greg_maxwell_resigns/

"This is what I think about Bitcoin Cash:


1. It is very fast as it has 0-conf, the fastest over the counter trade short a customer with exact change. 0-conf is even faster than the so-called lightening network which must make multiple interactive hops to a recipient. As the [median](https://www.swiftinstitute.org/sites/default/files/upload/The%20Statistics%20of%20Payments_v15%20-%20Chapter%2010%20How%20big%20is%20that%20payment.pdf) cash spend is just $15, 0-conf hands Bitcoin Cash a speed advantage over **all other cryptos**.

2. It always operates **uncongested by design**, even when it becomes the first [global currency](http://blog.vermorel.com/journal/2017/12/17/terabyte-blocks-for-bitcoin-cash.html), your TX will still get into the next block.

3. It has 10 minute block times necessary for **incredible scaling on-chain**. It has already proven on-chain scaling to 8MB blocks and can scale on-chain to 32MB blocks by simply relaxing a soft-limit. The Bitcoin Cash testnet has [mined](https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://news.bitcoin.com/gigablock-testnet-researchers-mine-the-worlds-first-1gb-block/&ved=0ahUKEwiwxZCYv7DYAhWCx7wKHfD1DJUQFgglMAA&usg=AOvVaw0lommjypr6e-N0LaD5-Qb7) 1 GB blocks demonstrating on-chain scaling to beyond visa levels, and this [study](http://blog.vermorel.com/journal/2017/12/17/terabyte-blocks-for-bitcoin-cash.html) examines on-chain scaling to blocks supporting 10 billion people x 50 TXs/day.

4. It has gained the coveted **network effect** advantage with the influx of merchants which has already begun to drive merchant acceptance. You can expect Bitcoin Cash to regain the dominant crypto position it held prior to the blockstream/core aberration. This is why, regardless of the features/capabilities of any altcoin (including Bitcoin Core), Bitcoin Cash can look forward to the greatest growth.

5. It is supported by a community that is bound by **vision and generosity** rather than censorship and deceit. It enjoys the high moral ground of ""a peer-to-peer electronic cash system"" as described in the whitepaper.



**Bitcoin Cash - designed to be the first global currency.**

Both BCH and BTC forked away from what used to be Bitcoin over the last 9y. BCH merely increased the blocksize while BTC added 4500 new LOC and changed 95 % of it to accommodate a brand new block format that gives a centralized 75% discount to SW tx's over regular tx's meant to drive users to centralized LN hubs that will siphon tx fees away from miners and put network security at risk. ;12;1;False;H0dl;dsxa8se;Bitcoin Cash moving beyond just merchant adoption - Accountants and Lawyers;https://i.redd.it/tx6tcdoqf0b01.jpg

So funny story... In college I used to work at the finance office. My job was to go through all the receipts and make sure students who were asking to be reimbursed through their official student group accounts weren't buying alcohol- policy was you HAD to submit the ITEMIZED physical receipt so you couldn't do returns. Obviously there were great inventive ways to get around this, but the admins were pretty keyed in to the most popular method: whoever buys booze for your party- just pay for their groceries via the student funds by submitting their grocery receipts until you have reimbursed them for the amount they spent. The one that I spotted was new though (didn't rat them out): a student group bought >$1000 in forever stamps, submitted the itemized physical recipe to us, and got reimbursed. But since they hold intrinsic value, you can return them... and get all that embezzled money back for booze. ;2;1;False;reasonable_lift;dsxroc3;Bitcoin Cash moving beyond just merchant adoption - Accountants and Lawyers;https://i.redd.it/tx6tcdoqf0b01.jpg

"Lighting is also not secure, as for cheapest and quickest both wrong there are other cryptos out there that are much cheaper and much quicker than LN. My problem with BTC is exactly like you said 8MB blocks are fine, and the fact that if even with the current backlog developers are not willing to increase block size by some acceptable amount that would solve the immediate issue while long term solutions are implemented either shows they're stupid or malicious, and we know for sure they're not stupid.

LN incentives centralized nodes because you need a channel with big funds made to at least one someone, and the amount of connections that someone can make you is directly proporsional to his worth, so the more connections a node has the more convenient it is for you to connect to it, however as a node has more connections it requires ever more expensive hardware dedicated to it, making it so that big players can concentrate the most connections making the most out of the network, while small nodes would rarely get used, thus centralizing the network.

Not only that, LN has some weird perks, you can put money for 10 coffees in your channel with your favorite coffee shop, but then someone who has a channel with you pays the coffee shop 9 coffees and suddenly you only have money for 1 coffee on your node until you make two on-chain transactions to transfer money from one of your in chains to the coffee shop one. Not to mention that anyone can run a malicious node by simply spending all the money in his channel, closing it and double spending the coins, and if his transactions reach a miner before yours your money is gone for good.";1;0;False;Nibodhika;dsx4i1d;Despite massing brigading from r/bitcoin and core, @Bitcoin twitter account has gained 50k subscribers since it came out in support of BCH last week.;https://i.redd.it/kcs9rm3v2qa01.png

"So the difference is that BTC is changing the core functionality of Bitcoin while BCH Is maintaining it, but somehow BCH Is the one that's not Bitcoin...

Look, I agree that some off-chain solution is needed, I even agree that Segwit should be implemented. But Lighting Network has a LOT of problems, and not only does not solve anything it incentives Bitcoin to create centralized hubs of payment, which is the very thing Bitcoin is supposed to be fighting. Also 8MB every 10 minutes is not the end of the world, your phone is able to handle that on 3G easily, and a 1TB HDD would last 2 years of filled blocks, when the price to make a transaction on 1MB block is so high you could literally buy enough storage for 2 years of 8MB blocks, you really need to reconsider if keeping that limit isn't a bad idea.";1;1;False;Nibodhika;dswv3pz;Despite massing brigading from r/bitcoin and core, @Bitcoin twitter account has gained 50k subscribers since it came out in support of BCH last week.;https://i.redd.it/kcs9rm3v2qa01.png
