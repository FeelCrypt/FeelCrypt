"Aside the fact that strictly speaking, nobody except miners and big merchants actually *need* to run a full node, a node set up on a slow, high latency home connection is practically useless to the network other than retaining a full copy of the ledger.

I run a full node as a hobby to support the cause, on a low-end VPS with 1GB shared uplink for under 50 USD per year (admittedly it was on offer, but there's plenty similar available) current network usage averaging continuous 0.078MB/s...


Rough storage requirements based on average Bitcoin Cash block size over past 30 days;
> 202.29 (kb) * 4380 (monthly blocks) / 1000 (kb) = 0.89 GB monthly storage increase

Rough bandwidth requirements based on my node's statistics rounded up to 0.08MB/s;
> 202.29 kb blocks using 0.08MB/s bandwidth = equivalent 207.4 GB monthly / 2.5 TB yearly

8000kb Bitcoin Cash blocks, based on above calculations;
> Storage = 35.04 GB monthly / 0.42 TB yearly

> Bandwidth = 3.16MB/s = 8.2 TB monthly / 98 TB yearly


For what it's worth, here's Bitcoin Core 1000kb calculations
> Storage = 1050.08 (avg block kb) * 4380 (monthly blocks) / 1000 (kb) = 4.6 GB monthly / 0.055 TB yearly

> Bandwidth = 0.42 MB/s = 1.09 TB monthly / 13 TB yearly

While admittedly these figures could vary drastically & aren't what I would call accurate (by any means), I hope this helps put things in perspective - it should be clear that combined, the advancement of technology and falling hardware/bandwidth prices (let's ignore bitcoin's price appreciation) would likely outpace the on-chain scaling requirements for the next few years, until further optimisations are implemented and/or layer 2 becomes viable. As a short term resolution (and indeed, eventually block size would need to be increased anyway) it seems a no-brainer. ...Unless you're trying to sell a product based on sidechains...

"Or maybe the people who support BCH are old BTC supporters who saw the problems BTC was heading for and got frustrated with the lack of any development over the last 3 or 4 years. Maybe BCH is now more like BTC was years ago, a useable crypto currency again. Bitcoin a peer to peer electronic cash system. 

Maybe it's not the BCH supporters who are the desperate ones, seems the publicity is getting worse and worse for BTC, big names are dropping it as a payment option, mainstream media talk about high fees and unreliable transactions.

"Basically if you have 51% or more of the hashpower as a miner you can mine the chain any way you want, because in Bitcoin Cash like in Bitcoin, longest valid chain is what matters. 

In practice what this means is, for example you send 1 BCH to someone and in return you get something, like and entry on an exchange or a product, or credits on a gambling site. A few minutes later your transaction gets invalidated as if you never sent it. The other party can’t spend his coins received from you. You may by this time already sent yourself another coin from an exchange effectively cheating the exchange.

A worst form of 51% attack would permanently break the network by adding and removing the rogue hashrate over and over, not letting fair mining to continue. This would get worse as all fair miners leave the chain because of tanking price. 

It creates a customer service nightmare and huge uncertainty around BCH if it ever happens even once, but even without it happening people who understand the tech will be reluctant to use BCH for any medium or large value transactions.

"Your criticism defends LN, which is cool. It doesn't address the actual problem though, which is that the base layer is intentionally limited to drive demand for LN. It's ""TCP for money"" if Comcast were the ones designing the internet. 

Let me explain this in terms of net neutrality. Comcast would very much like to remove net neutrality so they can charge more for website bundles, like they do with TV, and also push their own entertainment services.

Consider the options you have with net neutrality removed. Comcast would be able to offer unlimited Hulu (""thousands"" of movies to choose from!) streaming *for free* with all subscriptions. Netflix, and other competitors would be rate limited and you would need to pay extra to get decent enough speeds so that you can even watch movies on Netflix. When a new customer decides it's time to pick a streaming service, will they choose: a) the free one with ""thousands"" of movies to choose from, b) the one that will always cost more because Comcast effectively charges a tax to use it. Most people would choose the free one, Hulu, because **why spend money when ~~it's going up~~ you can get something for free?**

Exactly the same thing is happening with LN. Blockstream claims it will offer ""infinite"" scalability, with no fees (or very cheap fees). Other competitors to LN, such as on-chain transactions will still be around, but you'll need to pay extra to get anything confirmed in a decent enough time. When a new user decides it's time to pick a transaction type, will they choose: a) the free one that offers ""infinite"" scalability, b) the one that will always cost more because blocks are purposely kept full to create a fee market. Most people would choose the free one, LN, because **why spend money when ~~it's going up~~ you can get something for free?**

I'm sure you're aware of the marketing-speak Comcast uses to defend it's decision for getting rid of net neutrality? ""Comcast aims to support an open internet, and is committed to removing Obama-era government regulation (aka net neutrality)"". The same type of language is used to justify LN. All that talk of ""large blocks cause centralization"" isn't really backed by any research, just hypothetical arguments and censorship, and is exactly the type of marketing-speak that Comcast uses.

I'm sure LN has lots of cool features. And you're right, if LN is ever released, Bitcoin Cash probably will support it. You know what the difference will be? **Bitcoin Cash will support transaction neutrality.** 

But if you want a Comcast-like company/""open source"" project/developers in your money that ""encourages"" you to use their products, that's your choice.";3;0;False;drowssap5;drdayda;"Friendly reminder: Vitalik ""I consider BCH a legitimate contender for the bitcoin name.""";https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/930276246671450112

"Why trust any confirmed transactions that happened? Why trust the entire blockchain history?  If a transaction took place and was added to the blockchain by everyone that should be the beginning and the end.

 Those confirmed transactions are all that really matters on the network. They are stamped and approved. Once approved they cannot be undone. So why do you need every transaction leading up to it? Why trust any amount of confirmations that come from miners? Sure miners need the previous transaction to make sure the incoming one is legit but why trust them? why trust the full nodes relaying them? confirmations are the trust of the entire network. The blockchain could be replaced by a algorithm.  A algorithm that determines what transactions are completely valid and no longer need a history. Say 2 week timestamp and 1000 confirmations. Just like a difficulty adjustment 

To ease your mind you could even build it so it only remembers 10 previous transactions with 1000 confirmations or more each. But you don't need it.

"> I believe the context in which it was mentioned was in the case of a fork scenario which arose due to two miners appending a block in the same ""heartbeat"" so to speak... not in the context of which set of consensus rules are ""bitcoin"".

Yes it does, but that would result in a chain split, which is exactly what happens during a fork. So it's a very similar case.

I also agree that I'll consider both as bitcoin since they share the same genesis block. Can't say the same about obvious scam attempts like BTG or whatever happened after that.

I'm actually looking forward to the Ethereum PoS upgrade, since it'll be a good proof of concept to see if the system will work in practice.

"For sure. But I wouldn't go so far as to say BCH is ""unlikely"" to ever switch to proof of stake. I fully expect it to be alive and well by the time quantum computers do become a threat to security... so, it may be probable in actuality.

And I am with you on BTG.. pre-mines may not have specifically been called out in the paper, but I don't think it's a far leap to suggest it is clearly counter to the spirit of the paper. I was actually expecting the BTG pre-mine to be overthrown by a larger computation power that disagreed with the pre-mine. I can't imagine the computational power behind the pre-mine was truly resistant to a 51% attack.

I suppose the fact that it didn't appear to receive a 51% attack suggests the majority of hash power preferred to mine a more profitable (somewhat synonimous with more ""real"") coin, than ""defend via attack"" the bitcoin ideologies on an arguably scam-like coin.";2;0;False;laskdfe;drd4p1a;Bitcoin Cash Logo Animation GIF.

Mining BTC for me means leaving my coins on pool for several months, which is just asking to be Nicehash'd. Additionally I can't move pools as easily, so this reduces miners' check on pool operators' power (via their ability to jump pools if they detect any wrongdoing by pools). 

For people claiming ""well some pools can give you your tx for free"", think again: that subsidy comes from a potential tx fee they could be collecting from users, which means it's just a freebie.

In addition to what others have already said, I want to add one thing: Even if your pool allows you to withdraw a small amount for free, it doesn't matter, the output is still dead: because unless you move it straight to exchange (leaving the exchange to deal with the headache), you still have to move the output once more to spend it. And moving that output will still be prohibitively costly.

"**$25 Transaction Fees**

Antminer S9 = $2000. 

Daily revenue = $39 (block reward) + $8.5 (tx fees) = $47.5 per day.

Tx fee to withdraw from pool = $25.

To make the $25 fee only 1% of revenue $25 x 100 = $2500 in daily revenue is needed.

$2500/$47.5 = 53 S9s are needed for this.

53 x $2000 = $106,000 (min mining hardware).

**$100 Transaction Fees**

Antminer S9 = $2000. 

Daily revenue = $39 (block reward) + $34 (tx fees) = $73 per day.

Tx fee to withdraw from pool = $100.

To make $100 1% of revenue $100 x 100 = $10,000.

$10,000/$73 = 137.

137 x $2000 = $274,000 (min mining hardware).

As you see, yes, revenue increases as fees increase, but so do centralisation pressures. That also ignores that with increased revenue, comes increased hash power and then increased difficulty.

"People who support Bitcoin Core tries to paint Bitcoin Cash into being centralized. They usually argue that Bitcoin Cash is centralized because:

(1) External forces outside the rules of the Bitcoin protocol like patents  (Bitmains AsicBoost patent).

(2) They indirectly object to Murphys law since they believe *everyone* has to be able to have the hardware to run a node unless you want centralization, which is ludicrous. Given enough time, the price of running a full node will be cheaper as time and goes on. You could also argue that the amount of nodes doesn't necessarily correlate to centralization.

Sure, you can think that these two points are true, and to me, the first case is a legitimate claim. **But where is the math?** Here you literally have statistics (albeit crude) that correlates to mining centralization. So why cant Core supporters hand over the statistics for these 2 cases?  

Maybe the reason there doesn't seem to be so much number crunching is because they might just be hypothesises..
