I thought the narrative is that Bitcoin cash is the original work dating back to 2009? From a technical perspective since it is a UTXO fork it is a work in progress dating back much further due to copying all the code and giving an airdrop to all BTC users , where BTC users have to actively choose to drop support for BCH to reflect in the price , otherwise BCH price has an advantage over BTC due to a certain percentage of BTC users losing their airdrop and or not being aware of BCH creating scarcity

Bitcoin is more secure, has more users, lower fees , and more merchant acceptance

>\> Lightning is unsuitable for most use cases because of the need to be always online

&#x200B;

this isn't true for multiple reasons---

\-- only receivers , not spenders need to **occasionally** come online without the use of watchtowers

\-- watchtowers

\-- even if you are unaware of watchtowers, one needs to only pop online for a few seconds every 24 hours

\-- If you are a retailer and your server goes offline , you can't process a  payment anyways due to needing to collect client data. You can't expect merchants to simply email or show a receive address for an onchain transaction when they need to take an order collecting additional info

False, if you have an open channel with a non zero balance, you need to be online. The only time you wouldn't need to be online is if your side of the channel has 0. So yeah, if you don't have any money, you don't need to be online, but that's not really a useful thing.

So, the fact that I need something like a watchtower, which has access to my private keys, or 'pop online' every 24 hours means, by definition, it is 'less useable' than legacy Bitcoin. Cold Storage on lightning simply isn't viable. 

Since I have to do extra work, and potential pay money and trust some ""watchtower"" with my private keys = *not as useful*

Casual users are discouraged by the fact that every lightning channel requires 2 on-chain transactions (one to open, one to close).

The only problem there is you need a centralized hub to do the replenishment, and centralized hubs are easy to censor.

False. Development on LN was launched way before anyone had thought BCH was a possibility. We need to compare when development began, not when it 'launched'.

That's not actually relevant here, because BCH is already accepted. So it's a wash, at best. 

So 24 stores accept LN natively, and *maybe* 4k can use them on an exchange like coinbase (that already accepts on-chain BCH for almost no fees and less hassle).

> What? LN was launched in early 2018 and BCH was created in 2017.

The LN white paper was written in 2015, and Lightning Labs launched development shortly thereafter. So you need to get your facts straight. People have been working on Lightning for MUCH longer than Bitcoin Cash, with MUCH less adoption right now.

A few things: 

didn't know this guy until now; 

I googled ""hodl shirt Charlie Lee "", and there is a photo of him wearing a HODL shirt with L printed behind it (maybe not the best message if you think crypto in general is about to take a long slide--not sure of timing)

BCH, BTC, ETH and LTC all took around a 50% drop in value since last year this time. (He sold in December?) BCH took the hardest fall with this latest hard fork. Every graph looks almost identical. Was this guy responsible? Is that actually the narrative. 

I don't think anyone should HODL any crypto as an investment. Treat as currency not a stock. If you believe in the currency, use it. Buy stuff with it or sell stuff and accept it as payment.
