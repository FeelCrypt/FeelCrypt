"I agree, why do we need to introduce extra elements (hubs) to already functioning network with nodes and miners? The second layer solution such as lightning could be possibly integrated on the current network by integrating the proposed hub responsibilities to nodes and miners instead.


I brainstormed more in detail about that in this comprehensive writeup.

EDIT: The important take-away is that the off-chain scaling solution via Bitcoin Core SegWit’s lightning network diminishes distributed and immutable network properties. It replaces bitcoin’s peer-to-peer network with a two-layer institution-to-institution network and peer-to-hub-to-peer second layer solution.

"Fast internet connection on my end. I'm not alone, a claim that can be tested by using the search function, for example:

https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/search?q=bitcoin+core+slow&restrict_sr=on

Theory of scaling is well and good, but we have clear evidence that users stop setting up or using nodes at some point because the volume of transactions makes running a node too laborious.

Newbies wanting to run Bitcoin Core (the most secure and private option) are routinely told to use a light wallet. This wasn't always the case, and points to a troubling trend. And that trend is users trusting third parties over time, and the dependent culture that spawns. Worse, experienced users eventually abandon the full node idea when it becomes clear they'll have to routinely wait hours to access their wallets.

Again, this isn't right or wrong - it's a matter of tradeoffs. And the tradeoff is clear. You can scale or you can promote censorship-resistance, but doing both is not easy and won't come about by adjusting a constant.

I would be more optimistic if I saw a concerted effort by the Bitcoin Cash team to make node syncing work way faster than it does now.

"> Miners are motivated to include transactions not just to collect fees but also to increase utility and thereby the value of their minted coins.

And therein lies the problem.

First, miners lose about 50% on their hardware investment every six months (as hash rate doubles in that period), making this anything but a long-term investment. The hash rate shenanigans taking place on Bitcoin Cash should dissuade anyone of the belief that miners in general have the best long-term interest of the network in mind.

Second, implicit in your response is that the block subsidy exists to begin with. And that's a function of two things: (1) the face value of the subsidy; and (2) the exchange rate. I'm sure some enlightened miners will notice the long-term correlation between (2) and profitability, but the rapid obsolescence of equipment means they might not even be around next year to reap the benefits. And the pernicious thing about (1) is that it leads down the path of infinite inflation.

I know, a miner can be compensated by either small blocks paying high fees or big blocks paying small fees. But banking the entire success of the system on high transaction volume sets the entire economy on a path toward centralization of nodes.

All of these things are merely tradeoffs - none of them are inherently good or bad.

"**Tragedy of the commons**

The tragedy of the commons is an economic theory of a situation within a shared-resource system where individual users acting independently according to their own self-interest behave contrary to the common good of all users by depleting or spoiling that resource through their collective action. The concept and name originate in an essay written in 1833 by the Victorian economist William Forster Lloyd, who used a hypothetical example of the effects of unregulated grazing on common land (then colloquially called ""the commons"") in the British Isles. The concept became widely known over a century later due to an article written by the ecologist Garrett Hardin in 1968. In this context, commons is taken to mean any shared and unregulated resource such as atmosphere, oceans, rivers, fish stocks, or even an office refrigerator.

"> I know, a miner can be compensated by either small blocks paying high fees or big blocks paying small fees. But banking the entire success of the system on high transaction volume sets the entire economy on a path toward centralization of nodes.

Let's assume ""centralization of nodes"" is somehow relevant (I'd say only miner-centralization but I'll go with you here). I do not understand the notion that this would somehow *decrease* with more transaction volume.

With minimum fees, people don't make flooding transactions, and transactions simply grow with users. If we have 10x as much volume, and thus 10x as many users, do you really believe their would be *less* full nodes?

We currently process 3 tx/sec, where my cheap laptop could *trivially* process 1000s. Even if a handful of Pi's are no longer viable, how on earth would 10x more users result in *less* full nodes?

"Lightning Network increases efficiency, it increases privacy, and it also removed the need to wait for multiple  confirmations to be assured that someone can't double spend. This sub is just filled with FUD over it because it's complicated to understand and people would rather fear monger. 

While the blockchain can scale beyond 1 MB blocks it still needs increases in efficiency like LN otherwise it can scale to meet the demand of tomorrow (eg thousands of transactions per second) as a distributed network just isn't capable of scaling to the capacity achieved through a semi distributed network. 

Lightning Network doesn't hurt the immutable properties of Bitcoin as LN is literally a series of smart contracts backed and enforced by the Bitcoin blockchain.

 It's just more efficient to say that instead of me sending you 100 Bitcoin transactions each onchain that I instead write you 100 contracts we both sign to send you Bitcoin with each subsequent contract canceling out the previous and then one of us only broadcast the last of those series of contracts onchain resulting in only 2 onchain transactions (one to close to payment channel and one to open it) rather than 100 onchain transactions.
