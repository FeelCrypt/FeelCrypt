Except you claimed that it was collateral that allowed loans to be classified as assets. If that wasn't your intention, then you phrase it incorrectly.

Yes, it is. Only someone who has no experience in the industry would claim otherwise.

"Please reread the first paragraph you quoted. Specifically 

> This move allows the banker to show the loans as their asset.

So yes, all loans are assets to the lender. We don't differ on this point.

Defaulting isn't entirely bad for lenders. The loans they make are in their favor. First, the amount of the loan, say on a house, is typically 80% of the value, and the rest is often subsidized by the gov't or covered by PMI (insurance).

The borrower is still on the hook for the balance of the loan after foreclosure, baring bankruptcy. 

Yes, foreclosures are costly, but the actuaries know how to cover the bases to know which deals are winners and losers. Banks don't lose money on loans, or they wouldn't lend. And overextending a borrower in order to collect assets or fees is a common profitable practice.

Finally, if there are losses, they are paper losses which are often inflated to offset other sources of income. For example, BoA bought Countrywide's crap $20B portfolio for two reasons 1) PR to show that they are helping out hard luck homeowners, and 2) a writedown on income.

Not exactly. They still had to have the money first. They didn't just make it. After they gave out bad loans they wrapped them up in loan derivatives and used fancy math and lies to make the derivatives seem valuable and sold them to people who didn't know what they were buying. Then eventually they figured out the bad loans were still bad loans and when they stopped making enough interest to fool pay the people invested in the derivatives the market collapsed.

"Market cap[italization] is just the outstanding ""value"" of shares in the market, in this case, coins.  Simply calculated by the # of coins in circulation multiplied by the price per coin.  

It's commonly used in investing to evaluate the risk of an investment based company size and interest in it.   

BTC and BCC have the same # of coins out, but BTC market cap is around 94bn, but BCC is around 5bn, due to the price differences.  

The disagreement above is based on perspective.  From a purely investing-commodity point of view, BTC is superior, but from a usability-currency point of view, BCC is better, as it still hasn't reached a significant number of users yet.  

Keep in mind that bitcoin acts in a similar way to both a commodity and a currency, so take everything with a grain of salt, as it doesn't fit into evaluation tools of the past, based around fiat/companies.

There is absolutely nothing stopping your bank putting $10000000000 in your account tomorrow, but if wanted to give some of it to your friend who is at another bank, they would need to transfer fed funds (if you are in the US) to the other bank, which is a 'real' cost to them.;1;0;False;ooloops;dolqx85;Since most people seem to have already forgot again what bitcoin was invented for, here is a copy of u/hodlgentlemen's post back then;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/77bx9m/since_most_people_seem_to_have_already_forgot/
"Arbitrary restrictions stemming from banking laws from previous crashes.

The weird idea people have to wrap their heads around is that in today's world, money = debt.  

If I have one gold coin and loan it to superman, who writes me an IOU, that note is practically as good as gold, as superman is practically unkillable and is a good guy with a stellar reputation.  

What is to stop superman from writing a billion IOUs?  nothing, but that would make his IOUs less valuable, so he publishes his own guidelines to put people at ease:  He'll pay back at least X number of notes every year, based on how much gold he can mine in a year from space.  But instead of mining the gold, he just issues new notes+interest notes, justifying the new mining capacity since he's been working out.  

That's how fiat works now.  There is no original gold coin anymore and we are all praying that the super friends always get along and keep on not-dying...

"> One thing: I find fascinating is how bitcoin seemingly prevents the fractional reserve to creating money. Can anyone explain that to me?

If people keep their bitcoin on an exchange, then the exchange can run a fractional reserve: it can sell their bitcoin on its own behalf while reporting to the 'owner' that the exchange has their coin. The exchange only has to buy replacement coins when the owner withdraws their bitcoin.

This is very similar to what happened with gold merchants, and still happens with banks (still happens with gold merchants too actually). The difference with bitcoin is that bitcoin is easy to withdraw over the internet, and can be stored safely by an individual, so the pressures that make people keep their assets in the bank etc. are reduced. So, more people hold their own assets, so the opportunity for an organisation to sell (hopefully temporarily) the people's assets on its own behalf is reduced.";17;3;False;astrolabe;dol1f91;Since most people seem to have already forgot again what bitcoin was invented for, here is a copy of u/hodlgentlemen's post back then;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/77bx9m/since_most_people_seem_to_have_already_forgot/
"Downvoted because this is chock full of economics “creation myths” that have zero historical evidence.

> People used to pay each other in gold and silver. Difficult to transport. Difficult to divide.

No historical evidence to this. Most ancient coins were worth basically nothing because if they were made of gold and silver people would just melt them down.

> Paper money was invented. A claim to gold in a bank vault. Easier to transport and divide.

Paper money was not originally invented for this purpose. There were numerous accounting systems but they were all just IOUs and didn't necessarily entitle you to some physical lump of metal.

> Banks gave out more paper money than they had gold in the vault. They ran “fractional reserves”. A real money maker. But every now and then, banks collapsed because of runs on the bank.

Maybe true but the history of money teaches us that money virtually never was backed by gold but by the concept of debt.

> All ties between the financial system and gold were severed in 1971 when Nixon decided that the USD would no longer be exchangeable for a fixed amount of gold. This exacerbated the problem, because there was now effectively no limit anymore on the amount of paper money that banks could create.

I still find it funny that some Bitcoiners are pro gold standard. *The whole fuckin' point of a digital cash system is that it's backed by debt, not by any physical material in a vault.*

> From this moment on, all money was created as credit. Money ceased to be supported by an asset. When you take out a loan, money is created and lent to you. Banks expect this freshly minted money to be returned to them with interest. Sure, banks need to keep adequate reserves. But these reserves basically consist of the same credit-based money. And reserves are much lower than the loans they make.
This led to an explosion in the money supply. The Federal Reserve stopped reporting M3 in 2006. But the ECB currently reports a yearly increase in the supply of the euro of about 5%.

Actually, as mentioned above, this is not the end scenario, it's the very primordial foundation of money as researched by actual historians and anthropologists, not economists.

> Apart from this insidious tax on society, banks take society hostage every couple of years. In case of a financial crisis, banks need bailouts or the system will collapse.

*Ding ding ding* Despite being this post being 50% bullshit, *there's* the reason we need Bitcoin.

> Apart from these problems, banks and governments are now striving to do away with cash. This would mean that no two free men would be able to exchange money without intermediation by a bank. If you believe that to transact with others is a fundamental right, this should scare you.

""Money ceased to be supported by an asset"" is untrue, the asset that supports it is the loan that is originated. It is 100% true that when a loan is made, money is created. But when that money is spent, your bank has to settle with the bank of the merchant. On the bank's balance sheet they have loans on the asset side. So all of the account balances they have fall as liabilities and if they had too many, the difference would fall on the owners (in equity). Yes, banks can create 'free money' by originating loans but that does not mean the money is not backed by any asset.

I can create 'free money' too by loaning you $100, all that is for the time being is a line in a database of mine saying that I credited your account $100. I still have the same amount of money in my wallet and you think you are $100 richer. But no value is created because the second you go to withdraw your money, I have to pay you. In reality, I make a lot of loans and know that only a few of them will even be withdrawn so I can spend some of my capital on other shit.

Banks expect this freshly minted money to be returned to them with interest. Sure, banks need to keep adequate reserves. But these reserves basically consist of the same credit-based money. And reserves are much lower than the loans they make.

It gets a lot more sinister and another point should be inserted into the list. **The banker doesn't back the loan with a real asset, but the borrower must back the loan with real collateral.** This move allows the banker to show the loans as their asset.

As you can imagine, the bankers got rich whenever someone defaulted on a loan. They got to collect real assets from the borrower. Given the right loan-to-value ratio, they could make a killing. This incentivizes the banks to make risky loans to collect from the forfeiture and basically put the lender into servitude since they still owe the banks the principal.

Of course, such a lucrative program wouldn't go unnoticed by the gov't. They got into the game by covering the risk margin in the loan. The banks had reached the lending limits ""by law"" (try to say that without laughing), so the gov't created programs to step in and cover the rest, ensuring even higher risk loans could be made.

This is how the little old couple built a huge $20B portfolio of high risk loans and sold them to Countrywide. The banks could buy the risky loan assets because any ""losses"" would be used as writedowns against income. Countrywide (and eventually BofA) didn't realize just how bad the loans were.

"Years and years ago, I started a business selling credit card equipment that I scrounged up from going out of business auctions.  I learned all about merchant accounts and transaction fees and how some merchants could lose their ability to accept credit cards if they ran any unusual transactions through their merchant account, like if someone owed them a debt of $2K when they were only a restaurant with an avg ticket of $18.  That sort of maneuver which might be thought ok to an immigrant fresh off the boat could cost you years of troubles. 

Anyway, I found all these layers above me that I could navigate around—I could work direct for an acquiring bank rather than an ISO and keep residuals etc. 

But I’m telling you in all of my knowledge and understanding I could never understand why transaction fees were so significant.  This was around 1996-2000.  Tech was progressing so why didn’t those fees come down? PayPal came along. Fees never went down. The fees still haven’t gone down. 

A fee should cover your electricity and hardware and expenses. Not much more. 

The thing I remember about a merchant account (having been trained to sell them) was the value claimed to justify the fees was that the merchant gets their money in their bank account in 2 days from the merchant bank. That bank in turn got their money from the consumer credit card bank days after that. So there was a period of time there where the business could run several thousand dollars up in fake transactions, get the deposits, withdraw and escape into the night. 

All of this knowledge from my past is coming back to me as I learn more about bitcoin.  The first deep impression I had about it was that it wasn’t a currency but rather a more efficient payment tech.  That’s why I argued it should be valued in relation to all payment tech it could supplant. 

Of course, with my background, I did immediately notice that it puts a person back into a position where they are sort of storing their cash in their mattress meaning you have to be your own bank which is still somewhat cumbersome and prone to loss. 

Anyway, thx to OP for this backgrounder.

Man would it suck if I could buy BTC and watch it go up in value.  I'd much rather buy something ilike BCH and lose money while giving it away tipping stupid reddit posts and buying coffee.  Let me go to coin market cap and see if I can find some more coins that I can lose my ass on;-2;2;False;kingp43x;dol7oss;Since most people seem to have already forgot again what bitcoin was invented for, here is a copy of u/hodlgentlemen's post back then;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/77bx9m/since_most_people_seem_to_have_already_forgot/
"There is no need to run a node on the network to verify the total number of bitcoins that actually exist and verify that it is no more than the scheduled amount.  One can just ask a friend who runs a node to do this for you.  Or if you are suspicious, ask several friends who run nodes.

Or if you want to check it yourself and are content to take a while to do so, you can do this without using any more bandwidth than the total size of the blockchain.  You download the block headers from several nodes to get the necessary verification information and then you download the data in the blocks one at a time.  (There used to be files you could get from Bit torrent to hold this data.  Or you could ask a friend to give you a copy of his files.)  No need to trust that the copy is good, because the hashes won't match the headers if the copy is bad..  

Then you go through the blocks one at a time, counting the relative change to the extant bitcoins.  You won't have to verify any signatures, since you don't care about whether the bitcoins are stolen and an error here would only make the usuable number smaller, not bigger.  You will need to keep track of the unspent transactions, to make sure that these are not spent twice.  So you will need a big RAM or a solid state disk.  If you don't have a big RAM then you can still use slow disks, but you will have to make multiple passes over the block chain.  (This is basically a sorting problem, and something that used to be done in the 1960's using tape drives, no need for much random access memory.)

Note that you are not running a node.  You are not running any transactions through the network.  You are not checking signatures.  You are not sending any blocks.  You don't actually need to connect to the Internet at all if you can get the block data on disk from someone, except that you will need to look at the headers and total proof of work (effort doesn't depend on block size) to verify that you have headers that are reasonably up to date and that the data in your block files matches these.  

Now contrast this situation with the banking system.  In the banking system you don't get to see the bank's ledger.  You only see the ledger the bank claims relates to you.  And even if you could see the bank's ledger you wouldn't know if the entries for other people's accounts were correct.  If you looked at the bank's ledger you would find that the bank has deposits with the central bank.  You wouldn't know whether these meant anything unless you checked the central bank's ledger.  Ultimately, you would have to check every bank's ledger, every central bank's ledger, and every bank's user's checkbook before you could tell how much fractional reserve hokus-pockus had been done.  **Contrast this with Bitcoin, where doing this audit is just a matter of checking a single ledger that is public.**

TL:DR.  The fundamental reason why Bitcoin is immune from inflating the currency is that all the extant Bitcoins can be counted by verifying a single public ledger.  It is easy to check whether one has a copy of the correct ledger and it is possible, albeit not necessarily quick, to verify that the ledger follows the  rules for the scheduled issuance of Bitcoin.";2;1;False;tl121;dolbbh2;Since most people seem to have already forgot again what bitcoin was invented for, here is a copy of u/hodlgentlemen's post back then;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/77bx9m/since_most_people_seem_to_have_already_forgot/

"While IMO you have the right idea but in this case, money is technically created when you get a loan. The bank's funding of the loan (by getting deposits from others) is actually secondary and the moment the money comes into your account, it is created out of thin air.

"> The banker doesn't back the loan with a real asset, but the borrower must back the loan with real collateral. This move allows the banker to show the loans as their asset.

No, all loans are assets to the lender. 

>As you can imagine, the bankers got rich whenever someone defaulted on a loan. They got to collect real assets from the borrower. 

Where did you hear this? Because it is entirely false. Defaulting is bad for lenders. The amount of work that goes into repossessing assets means it's not a money making proposition. 

>This incentivizes the banks to make risky loans to collect from the forfeiture and basically put the lender into servitude since they still owe the banks the principal.

Uh, no.

"> Now, I'll take your word on the state of the British media, but C-Span is an American network, and our discussion here is about that network.

I'm just saying that the right-wing, pro-brexit British press reported it just as C-SPAN reported it, and therefore the fact that C-SPAN reported it (and the way they reported it) can't be taken as some kind of lefty conspiracy to promote unnewsworthy things. It *was* newsworthy, and C-SPAN *did* report it in much the same way as the rest of the press, and in much the same way as the right wing blog-o-sphere reported it.

> Our discussion was about whether or no C-Span is biased, let's go back to that. You can easily convince me that they are not biased: 

I'm not trying to convince you that they're not biased. I'm trying to convince you that the examples you picked don't indicate more than a small amount of bias (hardly any news organisations are unbiased; BBC World Service is about as close as it gets).

> if you can point me to a few quality pieces they have authored which are praising Trump, praising the tremendous positive contribution of Putin to the Russian society, pro-Brexit, anti-EU

You seem to understand neutrality as ""equal time"", i.e. just printing every viewpoint uncritically and trying to balance it out. That's generally not what organisations like C-SPAN and the beeb aim for. Each topic/article/whatever should in itself aim to be neutral, rather than trying to balance out non-neutral articles that praise/criticise trump or putin or whoever. An article from the BBC might report a study or speech or conference, but it won't endorse its views. The news is only as pro-Brexit or anti-Brexit as reality allows.

And you seem to be taking the May comment as anti-Brexit. That's a pretty superficial reading, as given the cabinet in-fighting and prospect of someone more hardline triggering a Tory leadership election, hard brexiters are rubbing their hands with glee at any sign of May's weakness.
