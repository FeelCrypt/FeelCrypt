The patch itself was in a Github page describing.. the patch itself.

It was BTU who publicized the bug by describing it in detail and posting it into a commitid directly in the Git repository.

Amplifying BTU's own words with a Tweet is irresponsible?!

"Provide evidence that it was an orchestrated and planned attack. According to this article https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/security-researcher-found-bug-knocked-out-bitcoin-unlimited/ the bug was disclosed to Mitre’s Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database. The result:

>However, even following this responsible disclosure, Gardner thought there was a risk that the vulnerabilities would be abused as soon as they were fixed in the Bitcoin Unlimited code repository. After all, at that point the problem isn’t really solved: anyone running the released Bitcoin Unlimited software is still vulnerable until they download and run the new, revised version. This opens a window for attackers.

>“The problem is, the bugs are so glaringly obvious that when fixing it, it will be easy to notice for anyone watching their development process,” she said.

>It now appears that is exactly what has happened. While the Bitcoin Unlimited developers did indeed fix the issue shortly after it was pointed out to them, they did so with far too conspicuous a GitHub commit message, Gardner told Bitcoin Magazine once it appeared the bugs seemed fixed and before the attacks began.

>“Their commit message does ring alarm bells. I’m not sure if anyone will notice, but they probably should have obfuscated the message a bit more. The wording might attract closer scrutiny. But if it went unnoticed for this long, maybe it will go unnoticed.”

It's no longer in the hands of anyone if this is a clear and open bug which is exploitable. Of course you'll get back actors in any community (Note: I am not saying from which community) who will take advantage of this to either

 - Disrupt the service
 - Make a point about its vulnerabilities
 - Kick BU nodes off the network
 - Fun and games
