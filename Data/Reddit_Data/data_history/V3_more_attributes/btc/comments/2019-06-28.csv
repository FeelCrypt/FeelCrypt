The setup is in SQL. It works by inputting API keys into a user database. It only needs trading access so there's no way to withdraw funds. Worst case would be to market buy/sell all your funds and that would cause us to lose reputation. The trading logic is to use USD to buy when the market is oversold and sell when its overbought.

2.	if another sound money coin takes the crown as world reserve currency then im ok with that - so long as they arent compromised governance like BTC, LTC or Libras of this space.";8;1;False;mars128;es8uihm;HODLERS don't care!;https://v.redd.it/2bfcs5tsv0731
