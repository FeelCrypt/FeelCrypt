They became slow because they got so much new users so fast and didn't got time to scale appropriately. Of course this sucks right now but on the other side they have a very good history and were the first to release BCH to their users. The API works great during low congestion times but is a nightmare during high congestion as I experienced it too. That's why I also opened an account on bittrex (the process was done in under an hour) because their api is pretty fast & reliable and you can buy BCH from BTC;2;2;False;zhell_;dmp4st3;Just bought some beers with Bitcoin Cash in Fuzhou, China!;https://i.imgur.com/CpSYpFn.jpg

Sure but it still stops the users who would actually want to transact in BTC. Japan is excited about Bitcoin, no doubt, they want it to succeed, doesn't change the fact that no one is going to pay a $3 fee to buy a $8 meal, still useful for bigger purchases though I suppose. ;1;2;False;lechango;dmot6d0;Just bought some beers with Bitcoin Cash in Fuzhou, China!;https://i.imgur.com/CpSYpFn.jpg
