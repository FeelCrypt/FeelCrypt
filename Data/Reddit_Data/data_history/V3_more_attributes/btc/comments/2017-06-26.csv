"> I'd suppose users want the price to grow as well, because they hold btc after all.

There is some overlap between the populations, but I do not think it is so great.   

Holders believe that it will be worth much more in the future, so they must be reluctant to spend it.  

Conversely people who use it to buy drugs or whateveer will probably not muy more than they need, and will spend it right away.   If they buy $200 worth of bitcoin,  spend $100, and then bitcoin goes up 20%, they will make a $20 profit -- if and when they get around to selling or spending it.  I don't think that the prospect of such fabulous profit would turn that group into a force pushing for price increase...

> Traders surely like volatility, but how could they exploit that in PoS?

My guess is that Holders, not Traders and Users, are those who find PoS appealing.  

They must be also those with the stronger wish for the LN -- which will be of no value to Traders, and will probably be useless for most Users.  For one thing, every multi-hop payment will have to be negotiated with all intermediate nodes in real time; which should make interception and tracing much easier.";1;1;False;jstolfi;dje7qau;Bitcoin is no longer just annoying, but now literally unusable.
