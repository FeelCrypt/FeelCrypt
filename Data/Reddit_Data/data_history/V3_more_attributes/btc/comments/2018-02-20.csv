It's EXACTLY why we have a BCH fork. The Core camp prioritizes the ability to access the Bitcoin network possible at the lowest possible technical means. They'll do seemingly ANYTHING to hold that line. The problem is ""anything"" appears to mean killing any practical usability at any significant scale. They pat themselves on the back like their fortitude and position should be admired. I get a mental picture of them building a giant wagon, and someone says ""there's still people not fitting in!"" so they hold everything and focus on allowing every single person to fit, then the thing craters, the wheels fall off and with a giant *clunk* everyone sits there going nowhere.

In February 2004, the U.S.-Canada Power System Outage Task Force released their final report, placing the causes of the blackout into four groups:[8]

1. FirstEnergy (FE) and its reliability council ""failed to assess and understand the inadequacies of FE's system, particularly with respect to voltage instability and the vulnerability of the Cleveland-Akron area, and FE did not operate its system with appropriate voltage criteria.""
2. FirstEnergy ""did not recognize or understand the deteriorating condition of its system.""
3. FirstEnergy ""failed to manage adequately tree growth in its transmission rights-of-way.""
4. Finally, the ""failure of the interconnected grid's reliability organizations to provide effective real-time diagnostic support.""

Agreed. That takes time. That's why BCH is not at #1 today. It's not only the dev team but how community businesses/merchants/customers etc adopt it. There is an entire ecosystem to consider. That all takes time.

Yeah... Again this is why we forked. It doesn't matter what logic or arguments we put forth. People set in their view won't change under any circumstances.

Yes. There are not many great ways to take a community vote, but some are better than others at separating signal from noise. For example, one of your metrics is price, well Wall Street can now get involved in pushing futures pricing and many such speculators (whales etc) have been involved a lot longer.

Not necessarily when **both** route payments for third parties. Why would you assume that only Bob will route payments, but not Alice:

S (Salary), R (Routed payment)

- `Bob [10] <-> [0] Alice`
- S: `Bob [5] <-> [5] Alice`

- R (A->X): `X [+3] <-> [-3] Bob [8] <-> [2] Alice`
- S: `X [+3] <-> [-3] Bob [3] <-> [7] Alice`

- S: `X [+6] <-> [-6] Bob [1] <-> [9] Alice`

- R (A->X): `X [+9] <-> [-9] Bob [4] <-> [6] Alice`

At this point Bob can't pay Alice anymore.

"IMO, routing is even a harder problem than you explained in the video.
Currently, the source of the transaction has to provide the whole route by encrypting the message with each hop's public key. This is so that hops won't know the source and destination, which provides privacy and censorship resistance.

In BGP the source does not provide the whole route, so it doesn't have to keep the whole routing table.

In LN this is not an option, so every node must know all available channels in its network. This is a lot of resources to store and constantly maintain. If this ever scales, how long would it take for this global routing table to propagate? I haven't made any calculations, but it's obvious that it will be unsustainable, and a far bigger problem than the one that Core says big blocks create.

The long propagation time for the routing tables will also create another side effect - a route may no longer be good as some nodes/channels may no longer be available or able to transact the needed amount. So if LN scales, many payments will probably simply fail.

">1) Isn't Discord based on IRC? It seems to work without issues from my experience.

For a user, Discord provides basically the same experience as IRC. But behind the scenes their system is structured very differently to IRC. Discord operates one centralized service that all users connect to.

>2) Is there any proof that routing for the internet is unsolved and what are the reasons it's not possible?

Efficiently finding a perfect route is an unsolved problem, look up the ""Traveling Salesman Problem"". Think about all the different possible routes that exist between two nodes, as far as we know the only way to find the shortest route is to test every single route that possibly exists. There are techniques we use in the real world that make finding a ""good enough"" route a lot easier though.

But protocols like BGP (which is used for global routing on the internet) aren't perfect. BGP itself has issues with scalability, as well as stability issues.

BGP doesn't handle networks that change topology well. It takes some time for a change to percolate through the network, and until this happens certain connections may be unroutable. The more frequent these changes, the more unstable BGP becomes. On the internet, this happens infrequently, big ISP's don't change their networks around that much. But with LN, every time a channel is created or closed, the network topology changes. Further, every channel update (transaction, that changes the balance in a channel) actually represents a topology change also!

"I'll concentrate on point 2)

Internet routing works only because peers trust each other. When I as ISP peer with other ISP, I trust that routing informatio other ISP gives me is correct. This does not have to be true, other ISP can fake any information in that routing update. This can lead to routing just not working, or to interception of the packets.

In general, there are two types of routing used in computer networks:

* Distance vector routing protocol (and similar, path vector routing protocol)
* Link state routing protocol

**Link state routing protocol** is the type that is implemented in LN. Each node has information on **every** path in the network. Then it can run for example Dijkstra's Shortest Path First (SPF) algorithm on the full graph of the network to find the shortest path. This type of routing is implemented only in private corporate networks, never on the Internet itself, as nobody can have full state of every link on the Internet. This methot obviously doesn't scale. But I could for example, as a private company create ""LN Routing as a Service"" where I have enough resources to fully graph entire lighning network, no matter the size, and then provide routing service to wallets, perhaps for a fee.

**Distance vector and path vector** routing protocols do not acquire full link state of every link of the network. They work on the following principle:
* I know what my peers are, and how to reach them, they are directly connected to me
* I forward info about my peers to all my peers. They know what I can reach, and they know the distance to the destination is 1 (me). I'm their ""next hop"", and this is all they know.
* My peers forward that information to their own peers. They now know how to reach everything that I can reach, but with distance 2. The important thing is that those peers only remember it's own ""next hop"", they don't memorize full path to the destionation. So, in their point of view, they don't know what happens with packets beyond their first peer (next hop). So, noone has full picture of the network, and this is the reason why this scales beyond size of corporate networks to the network of the size of Internet. But trust is basic requirement for this to work. Everyone needs to trust routing updates from their own peers.

Lightning network is different. To find the efficient route, you don't just need to find the shortest route, you also need to find the route that has enough locked funds in each channel on the path from the source to the destination. This route might not even exist at all, so there is no guarantee that the payment even can be made, even if you have enough funds on your end. This is the reason why distance vector protocols won't work, you absolutely **need** to know funds locked in each channel so you can chose path up front. And because that information might not be true, anyone can theoretically fake that info, it won't be reliable.

He did not. He made the correct assessment that routing payments will most likely change the route your route discovery process will find even though you were not directly involved in these payments.

This is of course true (and has been used as an argument by supporters on how your channels might get rebalanced by routing payments for third parties), but not directly correlated to the amount of work you have to do when you actually need to find a route.

It does not matter if the LN near to your node processed 100 or 100.000 payments in the last week.

With 20gbps internet that is 4 seconds, and I wouldn't be surprised to see 100gbps being common in a few years... if we assume bitcoin usage doubles every year we have 13 years until 10gb blocks are needed. 5G network is supposed to hit 20gbps for peak... I'd be incredibly surprised if datacenters were not outperforming cell phones.

"Hi!   
Yes, we most likely would agree I think.  :D  
But you might be misunderstanding me, because I have no desire to call for 'enforcing' rules of behavior on people from the outside or making judgement calls about others.   
.    
Rather I have more the train of thought that people should cultivate some degree of self control **in themselves**, perhaps adhering to a cultural norm that placed high value on individuals assessing honestly their own relative degree of competency on a subject **before they even form an opinion in the first place.**     
.    
The mindset that is so prevalent today seems to place inherent value in the mere act of voicing of our opinions--no matter what amount of thought (even if NO amount) has gone into forming them!     
Opinions do not automagically have value, (whether they are shared 'anonymously' or not doesn't matter in this case), and whatever thread of pseudo logic that leads us to believe this, is doing us as individuals, and the community at large, a terribly destructive disservice.   
.    
The primary goal, perhaps the only one with any value at all, **is the striving to gain a clear understanding first and foremost.**     
Forming an opinion comes second.     
And then refining that opinion further would logically come next...    
And then, later, with as little emotion as possible comes the sharing of our considered opinion.    
**THEN** we have shared and contributed something of actual value with others.      
Otherwise it is almost a certainty that we will end up contributing on the detrimental side of our society's signal to noise ratio.

"On the whole, I agree, but given this is an anonymous forum, legitimacy or validity is veiled by one's profile. This means that some benefit should be afforded to those that are willing to engage on a specific topic. 

Your way of thinking implies that some hierarchical structure shoukd exist, where one has to reach a certain level (judged by who?!) to be allowed to voice an opinion in public, and if one doesn't have that required level one has to stay quietb or, even worse, never question 'superiors'.

tell me about it! 

i am getting called a deceitful snake on another thread for saying LN will be more private than onchain transactions!

"Thanks for the tip! You're definitely right re. BTC's use case at the moment, but I like to think about what crypto _could be_ in 20-40 years.

I've spent a decent amount of time brainstorming sharding and how I would go about it if I were to build my own cryptocurrency from scratch. I definitely think it is a viable strategy for scaling, but it would be _very_ complex (potentially a similar level, if not more so, than the LN). The good thing is that it's an option to continue investing in without thinking about off-chain scaling, teams can simply work on this and by the time it's needed -- maybe it'll be ready.

Some definitions/context:

- Sharding means taking the blockchain (and everything along with it) and splitting it's load across a distribution of machines
- I think it's _possible_ to add sharding to an existing blockchain but will add additional complexities in that hard-fork upgrade

Implementation thoughts (with _simplistic_ examples):

- A sharding mechanism needs to support a network where both mining and relay node count are inconsistent and not guaranteed -- this is one of the key challenges I think this concept would face
- Let's say I have a blockchain of 100tb and I have a network of 10 miners and 100 nodes. An ideal distribution would say each miner and node gets 10% of the block chain to handle on their own. 
-- One way to define this might be to say, assign each miner and node an evenly distributed number 0-9 and take `shard_id = transaction_id modulus'd by 10` and each node and miner only processes transactions with their shard_id
-- What happens when shard_id=0 miner's power goes out? Do all those transactions pile up forever?
-- Even more important than a backlog issue, what happens when all the shard_id=0 nodes get DDoS'd at the same time and forced offline. Can you no longer even pretend you're sending or receiving funds?
- With the above in mind, you might plan some redundancies, right? Maybe each node and miner get two shard_id values for redundancy. In this case, you could still target all nodes or miners with shard_id=0 and have the same effect, even if there are twice as many.
- I think this points to a fact that you either a) need a very large network _before_ you implement sharding or b) need better mechanisms for redundancy
- Re-sharding in this world would be very similar to database shard migrations and potentially quite slow. If you're sharding down, it's easy (which is the more likely scenario in the _leading_ coin), but if you're sharding up in responsibility you'll have to slowly draw the missing bits you need from the previously responsible shard(s). 
- One interesting quirk re. the shard attack vector that might be interesting -- depending on how easy it is to gather stats on the health of the network, is that wallets could eventually be smart enough to automatically attempt to craft transactions in a way that their transaction ID will be sharded into a healthier shard. I don't think there's anything wrong with this, and in fact it could probably be beneficial to avoid issues above (""oh no, shard 0 is dying, how can I get into another one?"").

A half-step to the world with proper sharding could be something along the lines of:

- You'll need some ""archive nodes"" online at all times (Ethereum does this) that contain the full block chain for seeding. There should be appropriate hashing along the chain so that anyone at the tail end can verify they have at least seen the correct chain up to the current block and can compare that value with the network to validate it's sanity. The system _may_ need to find a way to incentivize archive nodes to exist for security's sake. You also need enough to withstand potential attacks (note that attacking archive nodes would only prevent new non-archive nodes from getting up-to-date).
- Now all other nodes should still maintain a full working set of the UTXO database that has been formulated by processes the seed blockchain.
- With the above considerations, all miners and nodes can now be sharded based on the current node count and hashpower of the network (since you're only sharding responsibility, you can re-shard every X blocks to maintain balance). 

A note on the above half-step is that you're _not_ getting the massive disk space saving from proper sharding (though UTXO-only nodes honestly are fine if you have enough seed nodes available), but you _are_ saving a potential large amount of bandwidth and processing time on the sharded nodes. In this scenario you could even have sharding be opt-in (or opt-out).

"Why would routing be so hard? You could use the same approach Tor uses, with routing/directory servers. It doesnt matter that these are ""centralised"", you could query as many directory servers as you want to find a preferred route,  and it really doesnt matter what route you use, as long as you can find one;  the LN transactions are still trustless, so its not fundamentally different from any other internet application that relies on DNS, RIP and other 'centralised' internet protocols. And that includes bitcoin (cash) itself. Your node can only connect to other nodes using centralised routing information. You cant even chose your route in this case.  Does that make BTC or BCH centralised?

More over, this only affects the optional second layer, intended for low value transfers,  so even if you think its a compromise, its certainly a better compromise than having  more centralised base layer nodes.

Privacy

Opening a channel between two parties allows a number of transactions to occur, with only one transaction ultimately commited to the chain (the final balance of the channel).

As far as I know all intermediary transactions are/may be obsfucated.
