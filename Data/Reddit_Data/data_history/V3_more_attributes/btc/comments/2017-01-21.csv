"I'm not entirely convinced that second layers are something to be scared of overall. It seems like a way to maximize throughput with the least amount of centralization pressure possible. I realize you do not see it this way, however.

">It seems like a way to maximize throughput with the least amount of centralization pressure possible

I'm relatively sure of this too. 

What I object too is the changes to / and integration of second layer services into the bitcoin protocol.

bitcoin has a unique incentive design it's designed to support and secure the use of bitcoin as a value exchange technology. 

the integration of second layer services to be supported by the primary layer incentives will have a negative effect on bitcoin. 

second layer services should use other federated methods to maintain their independence and decentralization. 

moving fee paying transactions away from miners and onto separate networks is undesirable and will impact the economy and bitcoin in a negative way. 

the bitcoin protocol must remain simple and secure a public good already BS/Core are abusing their control encouraging protocol changes: https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5p35z3/urgent_alert_key_compromised_upgrade_required/ ";1;1;False;Adrian-X;dcp38an;"Charlie Shrem on Twitter: ""If we don't implement bigger blocks ASAP, Paypal will be cheaper than #bitcoin.

"do some more research. node count doped form over 10,000 to 5,000 as the need to run a full node drooped and people were able to run wallets on their phones. it decreased not because of cost but convenience - this is what the designer of bitcoin predicted would happen - and it happened as predicted. 

I run a node because I am invested in the network and ensuring the network always agrees my bitcoins are my bitcoins. other businesses have other reasons to run a node - such competitive incentives ensures other bitcoin users don't need to study economics, computer science and programming and then download and review the bitcoin code and then execute a blockchain audit to know the they are not being cheated, they can just use bitcoin as designed.  

my network of friends and family do not run a bitcoin node. When I ask them why they do not tell me it's because it's too expensive they say: ""why should I?"" 

If I told them they should run one because it's cheep I don't think that would convince them, it's not the cost of running a node that makes a business or an individual run a node but the necessity to do so or the benefits derived from running a node. 

so you see you are wrong. your thinking is way too linear. 

TL;DR

No! as the number of bitcoin users who need to run a node decreases the node count decreases. it increases as a function of number of bitcoin users who want the benefits of running a node increases.

"That is a valid point, that having an easier option is a significant factor in full node decreases. However, it supplements and supports my point rather than contradicting it. 

As the cost of running a node increases, the number of nodes decreases. This is plain, inescapable reality.

However, your other claim is a valid counterpoint. Yes, we might expect that the greater the number of people invested in Bitcoin, the greater the number of nodes. And, all else being equal, I'm confident that this is true. Unfortunately, as the number of users has increased, the number of nodes has decreased. This is, again, plain, inescapable reality.

The actual, real-world evidence suggests that the cost of running a node is a far stronger factor in the number and diversity of nodes than the number of users.

This sucks. But, it is objective reality.

"> As the cost of running a node increases, the number of nodes decreases. This is plain, inescapable reality.

you are applying simplistic linear thinking, the goal is to preserve the benefits of decentralized control the goal is not to increase nodes. 

decreasing nodes is not necessarily a problem, centralized control is, and centralized control of nodes through centralized control of development is a symptom of how corrupt the system has become. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5p35z3/urgent_alert_key_compromised_upgrade_required/

with BS/Core controlling around 80% of nodes its like the Lord of the Rings 1 ring to rule them all. In today's environment it doesn't matter how many nodes there are if they all run BS/Core. 

on teh topic of cost I'd say [$50/month for a 150Mbps](http://shop.shaw.ca/internetplans/) and [$290 for a 5TB HD](http://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822236971&cm_re=6tb_hd-_-22-236-971-_-Product) is affordable for someone interested in ruining a node. That cheep home setup will scale to 20MB blocks over the next 10 years and can only get cheaper in time. I'd say most people who can afford 2btc can afford a node those who can't don't have too. I'm not convinced the barrier to entry is cost it's the need to run one.

"You're ignoring that fact that 1MB is a unit of measure for 1048576 bytes not a unit of measure for bitcoin transactions. 

a 4MB block is a 4MB block a 1MB block is a 1MB block. 

I support the idea of segregated signatures. I do not support the idea of dishonest accounting - calculating 3MB of block data at 25% the actual cost and the other 1MB of data at a 100% the cost. If all block data was calculated at 100% then yes you could make your point that a 4MB block consisting of 3MB of segregated data accounted for at 100% and 1MB of no segregated data accounted for at 100% = a 4MB of data  accounted for at 100% that would be comparable to a 4MB block at 100%. 

Claiming that a 1MB block that results from segwit is a 4MB block its falce. It's a 1MB block - count the bytes once it's written to the blockchain if you don't believe me.

not to mention segwit as proposed introduces more scripting option, this will increase the use of the segregated data portion so we won't see a the transaction increase you are expecting.

"We probably do but I'm not convinced everyone sees what's happening to bitcoin. 

case in point a ""malleability fix"" is like fixing your cat it's not actually a fix he needs or wants it's a fix the owner wants.
 

>...is it really a good idea to call malleability a bug that needs to be fixed, or is there already some manipulation through language going on and maybe having malleability is a good trade-off in Bitcoin right from the beginning?


>Lightning needs a malleability fix to function and to allow off-chain multi-hop channels to work.


>But exactly that would also allow an overlay network that becomes more and more decoupled from the Bitcoin network, not unlike the history of banks and gold (eventually no one uses gold anymore and it just sits in cold storage) while also attacking the base layer through usurpation of fees meant to pay for that base layer.


>We have payment channels already, and we can form networks out of those, albeit with some counterparty risk.


>Isn't that enough off-chain capability for Bitcoin already?
