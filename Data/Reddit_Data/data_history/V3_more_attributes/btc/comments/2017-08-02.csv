"How mining 'works' is pretty complicated and not something easily explained over reddit. Go look up some guides for the full story.

In short, though: mining difficulty (read: how much computer power you need to make $$) depends on how many other people are mining it. Unpopular coins can be mined profitably on CPU chips. GPUs are a step up in power, and most mid-range coins need a hefty GPU to make any real return on them. Bitcoin is hugely popular, so it needs mega equipment called ASICs that are machines that *only* mine, and take a lot of power. You need tens of thousands and a good electrical hookup to make any real money mining Bitcoin these days. Note that some coins were coded to be 'ASIC-resistant' to prevent centralization of hash-power in hubs, so that GPUs are the end game in the technical race. This is why video cards have gotten so bloody expensive recently... 

That said, you can pick a less popular coin (www.coinmarketcap.com) and mine it with your home computer, but be wary of the power cost of doing so, plus the constant strain will lower the lifespan of components, especially fans.";3;0;False;Lancks;dl1odn7;478559 (BCH) was mined!;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6qy4df/478559_bch_was_mined/
"It seems to me like BIP 140 would have fixed the malleability issue without a whole load of un-necessary overhead.

Malleability is caused by a single thing (inclusion of signatures in Tx ID) - common sense and good development practice would suggest you fix it by implementing BIP 140, then, which goes straight to the heart of the problem and fixes if in the simplest way possible

In terms of segwit, that seems like a convoluted justification at best: what was wrong with BIP 140? If nothing, then malleability shouldn't be used as a justification for segwit, because it isn't even the best solution (BIP140 always fixes malleability, while segwit only does so if the entire transaction on both sides is segwit)

By your own logic, then (applications need reliable Tx IDs), we still need BIP140 even after segwit, because malleability isn't solved and Tx IDs are not 100% reliable (and until we see how strongly segwit is adopted, it could be well below 100%)

On malleability, segwit is an incomplete solution that adds a ton of complexity, when a better, simpler solution exists and will have to be implemented anyway...

Dude, why are you still even arguing this?  The guy said that 1.7mb was the *maximum* blocksize under segwit.  That's factually incorrect.  All I did was correct him.

"I'm confused, do you think the Chinese firewall prevents the guys who met and agreed to segwit 2x from posting on their slack channels or picking up the phone and calling each other? It's not like there are thousands of mining pools, over half the hash power goes through just 4 pools, and the largest 8 pools are all Chinese (so they wouldn't even have to communicate outside of China to coordinate, assuming for some reason that phones, slack channels etc were all suddenly blocked).

Major mining operations work like data centers where they're at least minimally staffed around the clock.

The speed of response to a major attack depends more on the complexity of the response than any lag in communication between the miners!

That said, we're talking about orphaning malicious blocks that can be done at the pool level by simply refusing to update pool members of the new block. I'm sure there are other attacks that could hypothetically require a change in mining software (like blocking covert asicboost required a soft fork) and they would take much longer for miners to roll out updated firmware.";1;1;False;Gmbtd;dl1yjec;478559 (BCH) was mined!;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6qy4df/478559_bch_was_mined/

So yes, if your point was merely to correct his error, fine, but then you claimed, ""It would still take 4 blocks without segwit."" and my claim it will still take 4 blocks with Segwit, and you have done nothing to prove that wrong or even counter it.

In the meantime they have coopted r/bitcoin and other communications channels, heavily censored the sub, mercilessly banned anyone who disagreed with them, and promulgate disinformation to unsuspecting newcomers.  Some of them even tried to rewrite the white paper in situ.  You can get banned just for posting links to the white paper or for quoting Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin's creator.  In short, original Bitcoin got hijacked and ""jammed up.""

"The community has been deeply divided for several years now.  The number of transactions that could be confirmed was being artificially throttled, and the 'plan' to fix it would, by many accounts, make the problems much worse.

Because of the limitation, people had to pay higher fees to get their transactions confirmed, and while you could set your own fee, you needed to pay a high fee to ensure your transaction was processed (if the fee was too low, your transaction would fall off after a few days, but the recipient would be out of luck).  

This made bitcoin both expensive and unreliable as a payment method.  This is completely counter to the proposition under which it was created.

With the split, each side of the split can innovate on their own.  Many potential uses for bitcoin and the blockchain came to a halt or moved to other cryptocurrencies.  Merchant adoption had stopped or declined.

Hopefully those trends can reverse so that innovation and adoption can increase.  One side of the split will adopt uses that the other doesn't, and that is fine as long as consumers understand which coin they spend for which purpose.

Right now it's in the pump jubilation phase and is being propped up by a small number of markets that haven't enabled proper flows of money....i.e. nobody can really sell much BCH yet.

"The Bitcoin project was largely co-opted by a group of people who believe that the best path to success for bitcoin is for it to be expensive, slow, and at full capacity. They say Bitcoin is digital gold, and gold is expensive to move around and is cumbersome, so if Bitcoin is those things it will be valuable like gold, too. The anonymous moderators of the original bitcoin subreddit (/r/bitcoin) support this viewpoint, but rather than allow debate and discussion they simply ban anyone who disagrees and delete all posts that argue to the contrary.

Somehow through their tactics and their media control, they've convinced a lot of people that their way is correct. Many (most) of the old school Bitcoiners bought into a vision of bitcoin as being a fast, inexpensive, and reliable global protocol. After years of in-fighting, enough people were finally fed up enough to spin off and create a competitor to the co-opted Bitcoin, but using Bitcoin's ledger state so that every person who owned Bitcoin (BTC) at the time of the fork owns an equal amount of Bitcoin Cash (BCC). This allows the two sides to trade against one another and let the best idea win in the marketplace.

My words may sound hyperbolic, but there's a lot of backstory and drama to all of this. Some recommended reading:

(These posts were all written by the earliest bitcoin developers, who were basically pushed out of the project by the group of people who co-opted it)

***Behind on Bitcoin Drama? A (Short) History of Scaling by Lukovka in btc***

https://reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6o872y/behind_on_bitcoin_drama_a_short_history_of_scaling/dkg42ct/

scaling has been discussed since 2009 by Satoshi and others. It was always been clear that bitcoin would scale well enough to meet the expected demand, and that the 1 MB safety limit should be raised before it affected the operation of the network.

The Block Size War started in February 2013, when Core contributor Gregory Fulton Maxwell (/u/nullc) claimed that Satoshi's design was doomed and the salvation would be to switch to a radical redesign of his own.

Namely, Greg proposed to push all user payments to a completely different ""layer 2"" network (still to be designed), and restrict bitcoin to a vehicle for high-value ""settlements"" of the same. The capacity of bitcoin was to be intentionally restricted to be less than the demand, so those ""settlement"" payments would be forced to pay very high fees by means of a ""fee market"".

Gavin (the chief bitcoin developer at the time) and Mike Hearn rejected that plan, and insisted that the increase in the block size limit, that has been planned since 2010, was long overdue.

(Note: Both CEO and CTO of Blockstream never believed in Satoshi's vision of Bitcoin, they both ignored Satoshi in the beginning and only got back years later, with a grudge to turn Bitcoin into a bank puppet)

"> I still cannot stuff 3.7mb of Bitcoin transactions into a Segwit block.

Yes you can.  They would have to 3.7mb worth of large 15-of-15 multisig txs, where 95% of the tx size is signature data (subject to witness discount), but you absolutely can do it.  It would probably be about 400 very large txs.  But my point is that those same 400 txs would take 4 blocks to get through without segwit.  So it still is a capacity increase over today.  [Here is an example](https://testnet.smartbit.com.au/block/00000000000016a805a7c5d27c3cc0ecb6d51372e15919dfb49d24bd56ae0a8b) on testnet of such a block.";1;0;False;gizram84;dl26dp6;478559 (BCH) was mined!;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6qy4df/478559_bch_was_mined/
"Some felt that Bitcoin should preserve its main distinguising characteristic in being decentralized and censorship resistant (why Wikileaks could use it when Paypal shut down their account) and the other side just wanted bigger blocks. If you ask me, the bigger block camp's real goal is to prune down the number of people who could run their own node and provide a check against the rest of the system. 

Bitcoiners are stubborn so didn't fall for it. The result, the big block camp seized on the well-known date of August 1st to introduce their fork. It's actually kind of a funny choice since August 1st first became a significant day by the UASF crowd that essentially wanted to force miners to do an upgrade they've been stalling on for a long time. At this point the main Bitcoin chain will be getting segwit in a few weeks opening the door to tons of improvements while this bcash stuff is a like a circus sideshow.

"Yes, probably. Bitcoin cash honors the 478558 blocks that came before it. So if your bitcoins are stored in a wallet you control you can import that wallet into a btc client and spend them in a way that bch won't recognize as valid, and then you can import the same wallet into a bch client and spend them in a way that btc won't recognize as valid. (It's important to do it in that order.) 

As of right now BTC is holding around $2700, and BCH is climbing up to $700. This appears to be good for people who had Bitcoin on Monday. 

Edit: Most exchanges warned users that they would not pay out bch balances to users who stored their BTC on their service.

So agreement needs to be made between as many systems as possible and to make it more resistant to attacks we weigh powerful systems more highly. That directly correlates with chain length and so we accept the longest chain as the canonical agreed-upon value.

This is exactly what I was talking about that was changed. The CPU Hashpower Vote he is talking about was enforced because if a true fork happened without the new fancy Bitcoin Cash difficulty adjusting mechanism, then the fork without enough hashrate for the preexisting difficulty would die and quickly become ""not the longest chain.""

"All the responses you get aren't exactly helpful so far so I'll do my best to explain.

On a blockchain you have to put computational work in to find a block, since the algorithm adjusts to factor in how much computing power is thrown at it the longest chain as in the number of blocks is not necessarily the longest chain by work.

You could view it as climbing up a hill on a bicycle. The longest chain it is not about the distance you have traveled, but the height you are. The difficulty algorithm tries to keep you moving horizontally at the same speed, so in this analogy the difficulty is the gradient of the slope. Currently Bitcoin Legacy and Bitcoin Cash are at the same height and on the same slope. Bitcoin legacy is currently steaming ahead that same slope, Bitcoin Cash struggling to maintain the same horizontal speed so the difficulty algorithm is flattening out the slope you on the bicycle meet the target speed.

In the future Bitcoin Cash may get to a slope in the future where it overtakes the Bitcoin legacy chain in absolute height. Only then can Bitcoin Cash claim that it has the most worked chain, thus ""longest"" chain.

"Hashpower calculators count the number of blocks created in a given time period. By taking account of difficulty (the slope according the excellent analogy by /u/2ndEntropy) they infer the total hashpower of a given network.

Sometimes miners get lucky finding a correct hash for a new block really quickly, sometimes it takes much longer. Because of this variance it's better to count the blocks over a longer period of time (e.g. 1000 blocks instead of 144 (144 is ~24 hours)).

"For a long time many people believed Karpeles was crooked but in the light of this new evidence it would seem Roger was right to think Karpeles wasn't a bad actor.

*According to WizSecurity, the head of BTCE-e is directly connected to the Mt.Gox theft, which resulted in the loss of $2.21 billion in bitcoins.
“We won’t beat around the bush with it: Vinnik is our chief suspect for involvement in the MtGox theft (or the laundering of the proceeds thereof). This is the result of years of patient work, and these findings were surely independently uncovered by other investigators as well,” the website says. “Everyone who worked on the case have patiently kept quiet while forwarding findings to law enforcement, so as not to tip suspects off and to maximize the chances of arrests.”*

"See this is what I'm talking about. Just stupid comments left right and centre. 

If you describe theymos as having 'run off' with money despite him being a daily poster on both reddit and bitcoin talk it doesn't give you (or anyone else peddling the same story) much credibility.

The whole Theymos thing seems shady AF. But everyone's lack of objectivity and insistence to exaggerate are completely contradictory to their supposed 'moral high ground'. Because it seems they don't care about being honest as much as they care about badmouthing Theymos. Therefore I have little choice but to take what both sides of this argument with a pinch of salt. 

Also referencing 16million (as though the BTC was worth 16 million at the time) isn't a very honest or fair way of communicating your point.

This are of course lies, because everyone can run Lighting Network node (the layer 2 scaling for Bitcoin).

This FUD you try to spread is just a projection - because it is your exiled developer Jeff Garzik who in fact DOES work on KYC/AML solutions.

And with your bigblocks, bankers are gods, and ALL TRANSACTIONS ARE VISIBLE ON CHAIN - much less private, and easier to censor.

Miners can censor on-chain transactions.

No one will be able to censor some of 2nd layer solutions (not all, but for example some 2nd layer blind signatures could be an option. No idea if this can be done in Lighting Network in particular).

Might have to sweep your private key(s) in a software that does work with BCC. Try finding their statement on the topic.

"It is a probabilistic thing.

If you expect that a transaction (or series of transactions) will make your blocks to take longer to propagate, you expect to be compensated for it. For example:

* Assume a miner estimates that a specific transaction will add a propagation delay of 30 seconds
* Given: 10 minute average block time, 12.5 BTC block reward
* The new transaction must pay at least 625mBTC (1/20 of block reward) to make the extra delay worth the risk.

Of course that example breaks down is the case of no block reward. In that case, each transaction is competing with the fees of every other transaction. Block times are still 10 minutes.

Also, 30 seconds may be high for a propagation delay. When I was mining P2Pool, I estimated my (slow) node took 13 seconds to validate/generate a new block*. This delay was not one of the directly observable stats on the P2Pool stats page.  IIRC I had my max block size set to 500kB, even though 1MB was allowed: I based that on my upload bandwidth.

*I recall accounting for the poor efficiency of my mining blade on P2Pool -- wrote that off as a pool donation.";1;0;False;phillipsjk;dl17964;The split has happened on 478558!!!;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6qw86m/the_split_has_happened_on_478558/

Hash power is not the kind of resource you have to commit that way. Currently BCH miners are making something like 90% loss with their hash power compared if they would be mining traditional BTC. They can easily switch from one cryptocurrency to another - switching costs are low. So they can switch back to BCH when it becomes profitable. It simply doesn't make any economical sense to mine BCH currently, and I guess the miners are realizing that as the hash rate has been decreasing. Of course people can do it for ideological reasons...;2;0;False;jerguismi;dl204ft;The split has happened on 478558!!!;https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6qw86m/the_split_has_happened_on_478558/

I'm glad the current modteam feels this way, as one of their previous moderators had previously created and posted a big list of what he described ""people attacking /r/btc and /r/bitcoin"", which promptly found itself on the frontpage. 

I found myself #2 on this list, and he repeatedly ignored me when I asked what I'd done to warrant such treatment. AFAIK I'd never interacted with the guy before, but because I argue a pro-core or middle of the road position I'm somehow worthy of demonization.

There was no lie. I bought at $8. I spent an entire day reading about Bitcoin and then wired my money immediately. Unlike some people who seem to literally take months or years to get involved I was involved pretty much instantly. I rode the first big rally to $32... and then the bear market down to the $2 zone... at which point I bought more than most people can imagine. Lately... I've felt Ethereum has a better chance of continuing the blockchain dream since the Usurper Core hijackers and Theymos censorship fucked Bitcoin up quite successfully.... meanwhile Ethereum has exploded in marketcap and international business support... while Bitcoin has shit in comparison.

No, there's a larger group of people (which I'd consider myself to be part of) that are rising above all of the bullshit of /r/btc and /r/bitcoin and are letting a small minority on both sides fight it out. Either way, no overwhelming mainstream consensus yet.

"Sorry OP, but I disagree.

I am on neither side of the fence here (and I feel any rational person who understands that human tribalism is a flaw should feel the same) - I follow /r/btc and /r/bitcoin. I now hold BTC and BCH as well as others, and I'm planning on holding all for a long time to come.

Whichever 'side' 'wins', so be it. It makes no odds to me - it's the future and progress of some sort is inevitable. Bigger blocks or SegWit. Maybe neither side will win outright and both will grow stronger over time.

But anyway, back to the point, to call BCH 'Bitcoin Cash' and BTC 'Bitcoin' doesn't some across as a great idea. It's going to be confusing for noobs and whilst you may consider that an irrelevance you have got to acknowledge the bigger picture here. Cryptos are/will be/should be the future but they need to be made as accessible and understandable to the general public as possible.

At the end of the day, why be so tribal and obstinate about the name? Bcash works well. It ticks all the branding boxes. It's a good name, easy to remember and the word 'cash' is descriptive whilst the 'B' denotes its origin.

I mean, fuck, we *could* rename Bitcoin-proper, but that seems like the less logical solution, by far, just to appease a vocal minority.

IF (big if) BCH becomes larger than BTC there would be a case for calling BCH 'Bitcoin', but it's simply too early to have that conversation. For now, BCH is the lesser of the two simply due to its age and lack of popular support at the present time.

"The reason ""Bitcoin Cash"" is less confusing than ""Bcash"" is because it makes clear that it's a variant of Bitcoin. If a tell a newb about ""Bcash"", then sure, he's unlikely to confuse it with the other Bitcoin chain, but he's also unlikely to realize that the new chain has the same ledger history and almost the same rules as the other Bitcoin chain, and that it's supporters believe it will be considered simply ""Bitcoin"" in the future.

The thing is, cryptocurrency forks are inherently confusing to most people.
