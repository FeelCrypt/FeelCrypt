"Bitcoin BCH is Bitcoin. 

No offence intended, but I'm not sure if you understand what a brand is? 

Bcash is an attempt to confuse the Bitcoin Cash Brand, alienate it from hits origins. Bcash requires you build a new brand.

Likewise green is an attempt to differentiate Bitcoin Cash from Bitcoin Core, it requires you build a new brand image.

Bcash = green

Bitcoin Cash = Orange. 

failing to understand this is probably why people haven't ever paid you to design brand identities. 

It so happens that many Bitcoin Cash enthusiasts were able to recognise the Brand dilution with Bcash, but not able to recognise the same with Green. Brands are not dictated they are earned, Brand images are used to leverage the brand. 

I'm pro brand confusion, it gives Bitcoin Cash enthusiasts an opportunity to muy more BCH at a discount. 

But to grow Bitcoin BCH needs a consistent brand identity and given 80% of Bitcoin were issued before the BCH fork I'd say it's >80% Bitcoin.

"**Barycenter**

The barycenter (or barycentre; from the Ancient Greek βαρύς heavy + κέντρον centre) is the center of mass of two or more bodies that are orbiting each other, which is the point around which they both orbit. It is an important concept in fields such as astronomy and astrophysics. The distance from a body's center of mass to the barycenter can be calculated as a simple two-body problem.

In cases where one of the two objects is considerably more massive than the other (and relatively close), the barycenter will typically be located within the more massive object.

"First, note that you're taking the ""double-down on the changing the subject to focus on a different subreddit"" strategy, once again reaffirming my initial point here. This doesn't bode well in the ""does this account reflect a genuine person trying to seek truth and engage in civil discourse, or a troll solely interested in spreading malicious, false propaganda"" department... but whatever, let's set that aside for the moment.

>How about you extend an olive branch and unban me from /r/bitcoin then?


Have you appealed (or even inquired about) your ban via the mod-mail feature? Generally that's the proper medium to do so (and the first step to take, if you're interested in getting un-banned).

>You'll never win over someone like me

I'm not sure what you're referring to in terms of ""winning""... are we competing in some way that I wasn't aware of? I'm simply trying to discover, express, and propagate the truth, thereby furthering the collective understanding to the best of my ability; incidentally, that's all I am ever really doing on reddit. I would hope that this (or something like it) would be a common goal we share.

>someone like me who was banned for nothing except challenging theymos

You claim that you were ""banned for nothing except challenging theymos"", but this doesn't appear to be the case. This leads me to believe that you haven't actually inquired into the reason for your ban, which once again doesn't bode well for your sincerity or intentions here.

>no matter how strong you think your argument is because I'm living it personally

I also don't understand this bit, because none of the statements I've put forth so far have to do with anything that you're ""living personally"" in any way that I can see. *Again*, I'll set this aside, though.

>That's why your time here is probably better spent elsewhere.

I agree. I'll go even farther: my time is probably better spent elsewhere, period. The very presence of signal in this chamber of noise is questionable.

>You're telling me you're nice while slapping me in the face at the same time.

I am neither telling you that I am nice nor am I slapping you in the face. I'm furnishing facts and correcting misconceptions with the relevant truths. Until this most recent comment, nothing that I had said was in specific reference to you at all, other than to observe that you had proved my primary point with your very first reply to me.

In any case, if you offer me your honest assurance that you're not going to go deliberately breaking the rules of the /r/Bitcoin subreddit (and to be perfectly clear here, going around trying to convince people that ""BCH is the real Bitcoin"" *does* unambiguously qualify as breaking the subreddit rules), I will rescind your ban in good faith.";7;1;False;thieflar;duazczi;Vitalik comments on /r/Bitcoin moderation;https://twitter.com/vitalikbuterin/status/964126608654151681

"It's quite clear why the threads were removed (apparently using the word ""bcash"" alone is enough to warrant a removal in most cases).

>It's funny, the /r/bitcoin mods use the same excuse, spam, for why they remove a lot of posts.

No, we don't (unless it actually *is* spam). The vast majority of posts that are removed from there are actually flaired so that the rBitcoinMod account can automatically remove the post and respond with a distinguished comment to notify the user of the reason for the removal and suggest a next step. You can see a list of its recent actions directly from [its user page](https://www.reddit.com/user/rbitcoinmod), in fact.

The mod-logs aren't ""hidden"" in any sense, they're just not published publicly, just like [you don't publish comprehensive financial records for you and your family, even if I ask you to](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7ej6io/roger_ver_is_paying_millions_in_social_media/dq7q8dn/). Of course, if you want to turn over those records and prove you're not a human trafficker, please let me know, and we can proceed from there.

Literal financial censorship. And then he has the nerve to act like he's some libertarian on Twitter? What a joke.

/u/theymos has been [protecting the Bitcoin subreddit from abuse for a very long time](https://web.archive.org/web/20111028210631/reddit.com/r/bitcoin). It's more than reasonable to have a moderation policy that ensures the community isn't taken over with off-topic discussions. Bitcoin Cash is technically, socially, economically and literally **not** Bitcoin, so it doesn't belong on /r/Bitcoin. Same with XT, Unlimited and every other altcoin or altcoin-to-be that claims it is Bitcoin or will become Bitcoin.

Libertarianism doesn't mean that you have to be **forced** to tolerate dangerous ideas you disagree with on your own private spaces.

"Helping or giving good advice to BTC (Bitcoin) dev team is actually bad for all Bitcoin Cash (BCH) ~~users~~ hodlers. It's like cutting a branch on which we sit.

Imagine if by some divine intervention, luke-jr, theymos, Blockstream, and all that's bad in Bitcoin (BTC) would go away. Bitcoin (BTC) would immediately shift block size to 8 or 32 MB, remove RBF, while keeping all the Segwit innovations. Fees would be the same or lower than BCH, thanks to Segwit. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) have no reason to exist, and it's value would drop to... I don't know, drop to where a redundant airdrop drops once it's dumping is complete.

I love what BCH is doing: it's enabling us to exchange money without any fear of high fees or network congestion. It's a real peer-to-peer cash system, what Bitcoin should be. My crypto holdings are at least 50% BCH by this point, because from what I've seen so far, I strongly believe it's going to win long-term. But if Bitcoin (BTC) implements all the good things from BCH, then the long-term projection is gone, and it's game over for us BCH holders.

So, just... Everyone, be careful who you help. Bitcoin (BTC) is fine the way it is. It's a blind god without a guide dog.

There's an organization (blockstream), funded with tens of millions of dollars by VCs, trying to ensure that bitcoin sucks unless you use the Lightning Network.

The Lightning Network is a really neat technology whereby bitcoin transactions can be free as long as you make an account with a centralized service. But because it's complicated and hard to understand, they try to tell everyone the Lightning Network is decentralized.

When realistically, due to the network effect and how the Lightning Network works, it is likely that only one company can succeed at doing this.

If Bitcoin can be so effortlessly attacked then you should sell your BTC for a coin like BCH that welcomes all transactions. It should be left to a free market of miners who should decide what value a transaction has to them. And it seems transactions don’t have to be expensive to be included in every block with BCH.

"It took all of 12 minutes for me to set Coinbase Commerce up with my Shopify store and now we can accept BCH, BTC, ETH and LTC.  Until today we could only accept BTC and LTC because they were the only cryptos with gateways that worked easily with Shopify.  This is a big day for BCH.

Bitpay really screwed themselves because I had their gateway set up and waiting for them to implement BCH and it never happened.  Now that I can take four cryptos with one gateway... it would take a lot more work to get us to switch now.
