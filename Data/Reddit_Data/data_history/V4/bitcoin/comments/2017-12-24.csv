"First to market is a massive advantage as you can see.

2. It is not centralised, no spokesperson can give a bad interview, no CEO can lead Bitcoin in a certain direction. Humans inevitably make mistakes. By having a community you minimise such risks, similar to why a company has a board.

3. The coins are far more distributed, although around 1000 people own 40%, that is far more distributed and less controlled by the big boys than Bitcoin Cash and other coins.

4. The Bitcoin community focus on security and decentralisation, over fast/cheap transactions. This makes it more suitable as a long term store of value, that doesn't have an upkeep (digital gold), hopefully lower volatility in the future and one that the people trust because of its proven track record. 

Lets see how Bcash scales, but just 1 month ago the number of transactions were lower than those of Dogecoin. If it can live up to its scalability claims is another question.

"Anyone can make typos. And not everyone does well at grammar. Being weak at grammar doesn't make you weak at evaluating technical patterns, nor does your ability to outline an argument properly with perfect use of the English language on an online forum have any relevance in technical chart pattern recognition, let alone any other descussion other then grammar usage discussions.

**But nice red herring.**
--

Furthermore, if you base the validity of an argument on grammatical errors that don't make any impact to the actual substance of the argument, instead of the actual argument itself, you are being illogical. Take some time to understand how to actually logically evaluate a claim as well as getting yourself familiar with pattern recognition in technical trading. Come back to me when you can counter my claim with something that actually has weight to it instead of a pointless retort on word usage.

Just for reference, in the hours since my first post, bitcoin peaked at  about $15,000 on December 23rd before beginning to slide back down. On 24th Dec (today) its at just under $13,000 with a general downward trend. If you can recall, I clearly stated the right shoulder should peak at about $15,000 to $16,000 before another downward slide occurs. I even suggested that people sell between those price points if they are in bitcoin to protect themselves from the next downward slide. A sale at this point would have successfully protected against a 14-15 % capital loss. And thus, was a successful prediction.

Full confirmation of the pattern will occur when the slide reaches the neckline of the pattern again. Given that its a descending neckline, I would say that this point lies between 12,000 to 11,000. Possibly even as low as 10,000 given the steepness of the neckline, but that's a bit of a stretch.

 I'm going to put my guess on 12,500. If I had a long position on bitcoin at this current point in time, I would sell should the price go below 12,500 to protect capital. Obviously a successful prediction would mean this proposed sale at that proposed point would shield the seller from sizable capital loss.

But I probably used a word wrong somewhere or accidently used a homophone incorrectly so apparently my argument and analysis is completely invalid, even if its already being shown to be correct. *eyeroll*

"> This means nothing if the government decides they want your gold and can seize it at will.

Government can seize your bitcoin (they've already seized hundreds of millions in bitcoin), so this can't be the core point either.

""not if I hide it"", well you can hide gold as well. That doesn't make it any more useful. If you want to interface with legal markets you have to report your income and holdings. As you should for both practical, moral and legal reasons.

This is also straying from the ""store of value"" arguments. if you want an anonymous currency then there is nothing better than cash. A blockchain that keeps a perfect record of every transaction which will one day be decrypted, that requires interface with exchanges which keep records and has to ask for identification, is not.

The government is a lot more likely to try and seize something like bitcoin than gold. Gold is firmly established and regulated all over the world. Governments still hold a lot of their wealth in gold, they do not want to disrupt the gold market. Bitcoin is new and its use cases are mainly illegal, there is no underlying economy based on bitcoin that the government has to worry about disrupting. Without exchanges the current bitcoin economy would collapse and it would be trivially easy for them to shut down exchanges if they wanted to.

If you're worried about government then there are multiple other failure points that exist in bitcoin:

During times of crisis government often suspends internet use (including satellite internet). This will make bitcoin unusable.

Even if your government doesn't ban or crack down on bitcoin, a foreign government might, and due to the centralization of bitcoin mining, if China shuts down every bitcoin mine in its territory could easily cause a crisis in confidence which tanks the value of bitcoin.

Government can legally hack your computer and monitor your internet use. They have already compromised things like Tor.

If there's a societal collapse, the power grid will fail and so will the telecoms network, there'll be no way to operate the blockchain and bitcoin becomes no different to any other encrypted number. Even if we got blown back to the stone age gold would still be valuable (since gold was valuable in the stone age).

"You seem to have basic misunderstanding about stocks: 

Let's say you have a growing company, your dad isn't Donald Trump but you really need a new factory to keep growing. What do you do? You put yourself on the market and sell 50% of your company in stocks in order to get capital from shareholders. Shareholders now have a stake in your company, they vote in board members to run the company and are entitled to dividends if you pay them. As the company becomes more valuable the value of stocks rise, sometimes the shareholders benefit more from money being put into the company instead of receiving dividends. For example Apple pays quarterly dividends to all shareholders, the more you own, the more you get. Sone companies decide to invest that money into RND or infrastructure. 


That's some basics of stocks. Sure, P/E ratios are fucked right now but it's been a bull market due to government intervention, we are overdue for a dip in stock prices. But stocks are backed by actual companies, unlike bitcoin, which is entirely based on belief.

Apple stock can not go to 0 without the actual company losing value, bitcoin can go very close without anything fundamentally changing about bitcoin. 

Let's say I copy the open sourse software of bitcoin, so they are basically the same thing, my shitcoin and bitcoin.

"**Scalability**

Scalability is the capability of a system, network, or process to handle a growing amount of work, or its potential to be enlarged to accommodate that growth. For example, a system is considered scalable if it is capable of increasing its total output under an increased load when resources (typically hardware) are added. An analogous meaning is implied when the word is used in an economic context, where a company's scalability implies that the underlying business model offers the potential for economic growth within the company.

Scalability, as a property of systems, is generally difficult to define and in any particular case it is necessary to define the specific requirements for scalability on those dimensions that are deemed important.

Wrong. The gold standard was adopted at the end of the 19th century, the dollar had been in existence for a century prior to the gold standard.

The question is why does the mexican Peso exist when they could use dollars instead? The reason is that it started as a currency pegged to the dollar. This gave it value. But when they let it float, it lead to hyper-devaluation. They then pegged the new peso to the old peso and the devaluation has continued. There is momentum in an assets price, it can't disappear overnight with millions of people holding on to them. Its price will continue to devalue until they switch to a better currency. Mark my words, that currency will be a cryptocurrency.

The dollar started the same way. It was pegged to a weight of gold. When it was left to float on the market, it has steadily devalued relative to gold. Pegging is how national currencies are created. Peg to something with actual value, then let it float and watch it devalue. Then start the cycle over again. 

Pray tell, why do you think the mexican peso and dollar exist side by side? Is it because government ""gives it value""? How would a government do that?

The people are the reason. People's belief in a currency gives it value. People tend to believe in a currency when they believe in its monetary policies.

>Edit: your comment itself answers your first question

Exactly, as in any market *what someone will pay for it sets the value*. 

Only in the crypto market, especially considering the fact that out of my six friends who own crypto **not one hold their own private keys**, there is literally nothing *behind the crypto* whereas with a commodity there is an item theoretically of some consumer/industrial value and with a stock you have a company that *hopefully makes money*. 

What do you have with crypto? 

> total supply vs current market cap.

Irrelevant when you can fork the code and create the next coin. It's all about *what people believe*. 

The HODL'ers help solidify the market and then there are folks like me *who want an actual cryptocurrency* and even more who are looking for a get rich quick scheme.

So if someone is ""shitting on crypto"" make sure that you spend enough time listening to their arguments so that you can determine if they are churning FUD, full of shit, or providing you *honest advice based on their experience*. 

If you're under 40, it's likely that you haven't been *bit by a bubble*.

If you're under 30, it's likely you don't even *remember what a bubble looks like*.

Bitcoin today is still the reserve currency. You can scream and yell about it all you want, but the whole industry was created from what they did. All other digital currencies are “pegged” to it.

You underestimate how entrenched bitcoin is at this point. What other coin, that’s decentralized could take its place right now?

 Fees are high so people moving small amounts will have issues.

For the committed users of bitcoin, it’s a rounding error. We don’t move bitcoin all that often.

"Your response to my point that deflationary currencies like gold stop getting used because the incentive is to hoard them not spend them was to say ""let me know if you need me to explain how bitcoin and lightning work"".

Except neither actually work as a currency, so it doesn't dispute my point. Even bitcoins most ardent supporters have given up saying bitcoin is a usable currency and now say ""its a store of value"" that will one day maybe be a currency (or maybe not, some people say bitcoin is meant to be an asset and other coins will be currencies). Some people say that Lightning will solve everything and make bitcoin usable, except Lightning doesn't work as anything more than a tech demo so you can't say it ""works"".

It works in theory, bitcoin was meant to work as a P2P currency in theory. 

There are lots of software projects that took years to develop and had tech demos that failed completely. The fact its taken a long time is not proof it will work. Even if it does work it doesn't stop bitcoin being hyper-deflationary, so it doesn't change the incentive to hoard instead of spend.

"bullshit, the availability of communication channels and some trigger words like BTFD, Discount, blah blah blah make collusion more effective/probable... You telling me there's no chance there's a group of traders pushing the market???... please...

"so... Social Democrat... isn't left... it's actually a moderate right (leaning center) in my country... which actually makes sense since we, SD's, tend to be exactly like this... privatize what needs to be privatized, keep it publicly owned when it's a strategic sector, ie, healthcare (country is healthy, the market is healthy sort of mentality)

but you know, your country is so fucked up that every option you have is extreme right-wing compared to most republics/democracies, so I end up sounding like what you consider a neoliberal... which would be a conservative left wing in your country (ironic, I know, since I'm overall right-wing in my country's political scene)

You don't really seem to understand the issue of the Venezuelan economy...

they subsist pretty much on oil... oil dropping in price means they can't import most... anything... at all, this means products are rare, prices are super high...

add to this extreme inflation, and obviously people can't afford shit unless the government issues new type of currency and forces an overall raise, as per the raise of minimum government-backed wage (as is customary in socialist countries, the private sector tends to follow these)

so their case right now is that what you got with 1000 bolivars yesterday, is 10000 bolivars today (just an example, don't have an exact example of this, but let's just consider the fact that coca-cola decided to stop producing locally due to the price being far too high due to importation costs of ingredients, and no one actually consuming coca-cola when it's almost as expensive as any basic necessary bit of food)

In addition to this...

I have far too many friends with family over there, they tell me news of their family every weekend when we tend to meet up...

your next step would be ""they could just leave""

people aren't being allowed to leave the country...

so yeah, I'm not trying to be righteous here, I'm trying to point out the fact that a country became so corrupt and dependent on one single resource, that when that resource's value dropped, they basically went bankrupt (tbh, bankrupcy would've been easier on the population in the long run) due to corruption and an idiot being in charge";1;0;False;Booyanach;droveig;Quick grab the offer!;7lg5dt;https://i.redd.it/1lciqvoynf501.png

Serious and experienced investors as many here know that the best time and now

This is the best moment of the BTC when it goes down and you can get more coins to wait HODL, get your profit wait new fall and buy more coins

If we assume the actual value of a Bitcoin to hold steady (which we don't because it's a deflationary currency), realize we're talking about its value relative to the USD.

"> Ah yes, the old 'you don't lose until you sell' line.

It's true though.  Buying $75,000 of Bitcoin today and expecting to cash out with a profit in less than 30 days is kind of ridiculous.

6 months or 1 Year is a more-reasonable planned time horizon if you invest $75K of BTC today.      You could still lose if you plan to put that in for 1 year,  BUT  it is more reasonable to expect a profit  than expecting price to keep going straight up  the same month.

"**Economic bubble**

An economic bubble or asset bubble (sometimes also referred to as a speculative bubble, a market bubble, a price bubble, a financial bubble, a speculative mania, or a balloon) is trade in an asset at a price or price range that strongly exceeds the asset's intrinsic value. It could also be described as a situation in which asset prices appear to be based on implausible or inconsistent views about the future. Asset bubbles date back as far as the 1600s and are now widely regarded as a recurrent feature of modern economic history. Historically, the Dutch Golden Age's Tulipmania (in the mid-1630s) is often considered the first recorded economic bubble.

"It's nice that you funded the Internet Archive, they have a good heart and vision. Unfortunately they are hampered ridiculously by copyright legislation.

That million $USD would actually be most of the finances required to build the *replacement* for Internet Archive.

Financing the IA (and EFF) is great, but neither organisation is actually capable of doing more than the status quo allows or affecting any change in the area of digital preservation.

Replacing the IA will require a commercial entity, following the model of a Usenet newsgroup provider with a centralised^1 storage network, the control of which can be ceded to its users in a manner which cannot be legally censored in any Western nation^2. Luckily accessing the data in such a system would not require a subscription, as a Freenet opennet-style p2p network can be interfaced with by the user-controlled nodes.

There is actually a great model for this. In the future though people will take it for granted, like how no one actually thinks about the moving parts behind their daily driver technology, but I would not be bringing any of this up if it were without merit. The most important thing in the world to me is the end of censorship (10+years contributing to the first darknet software - Freenetproject.org, which would be a wonderful place to throw some money if nowhere else) and rights restriction technologies like DRM. People seem to love these ICO things lately, so I will continue with setting up the ""token sale"" for the system I am talking about, but if you feel like making a long term investment in the digital archive we *need*, I would actually suggest that we talk . . .

Nice job taking shots at a charity and then at a random subredditor. You should better spend time on actually doing stuff and not just shitposting on reddit. Saw your website. Registered in 2014. Founder has made one tweet since 2014. G+ recently updated after 3 years. One video on YouTube channel and absolutely no fucking info on things you've done on your website. Registered in Switzerland so money can't be traced. Also what the fuck is North Korean Human Rights Defender Foundation and how exactly is it supposed to work? I may have nothing better as compared to a big fucking NGO going on in my life but I am also not the one trying to scam people on the internet.

I made a couple thousand in Bitcoin and it felt so good that I donated $200 to a paralyzed artist in Kenya named Kennedy. He lives in a village with all disabled individuals that have been marginalized by society. Kennedy is a great young man and I try to support him as often as possible.

Pineapple Fund will be donating all of the funds to charity, and everything will be published on the website. The most useful cryptocurrency (acceptance, fees, reliability, tooling) will be used, and Pineapple Fund isn't going to donate to any ""partisan"" causes on either side of the divide.

"ive been working on this. the blockchain community foundation. 

its goals are pretty useful to the community: 

1. educate and train more blockchain developers. particularly to convert existing senior developers from non-blockchain stacks into the blockchain stack. we have jimmy song teaching a class at the end of january, and getting local projects in the bay area to come and teach us about their architecture and code. 

2. to help establish regulatory and accounting frameworks and standards. i am working with several projects in the bay area including stanford law's blockchain group, in talks with blockchain at berkeley and berkeley law, and other smaller groups with this same focus. i also plan to be very involved in consensys' brooklyn project, which is handling consumer protection amongst other regulatory stuff. 

3. to bring the community together and encourage adoption of blockchain technologies. specifically, having more friendly meetups and conferences, which im doing now already. ive been helping set up some events, 

* conference: the ""world crypto economic forum"" in south sanfrancisco on jan 15-16. (www.wcef.co, pm me if you want a discount code) which should be fun. nick szabo will be there, and lots of other speakers and cool people. 
* meetup: jan 9, cryptocurrency 101 with verity from coinbase
* meetup: jan 23, cryptocurrency hedge funds with founders from coinalpha, quantiacs, evercoin, bitbull capital and moderated by blockchain at berkeley
* meetup: feb 6, cryptocurrency law; shephardmullin, tokensoft, digiramp, legal.io 

There are other things that the community needs done, but which are not profitable to do like:

* creating general educational content, 

* maybe creating a free public space where people can come to work on cool projects and to meet other enthusiasts during the day, which can also be a venue to host blockchain project workspaces/ event spaces/ meeting spaces. 

* i also want to drive an initiative to help traditional nonprofits benefit by training them how to handle and accept cryptocurrency donations, and things like custody, security, and key management basics. 

* im also working with legalhackers, a community of about 50 cities of legal hackers, to put on a smart contracts hackathon around March of next year. stay tuned for more info on that. 

i've spoken with several cool people in the space, and theyve offered to help out in various ways, either by contributing funds, or volunteering their time to either be a teacher or to help in other ways. 

this project is just getting off the ground, and if you have any ideas for what else we can be doing, i'd love to get your feedback! if you want to help out, pm me and lets chat! ill make a proper announcement with all the verifications when we get some more stuff in order, and hopefully have the irs tax exemption so donations become tax deductible.

"Yeah, I've been reading through it. It looks like it's basically a paypal type of thing. It has nothing to do with crypto at all. Also looks like they're working with US dollars. You link your bank account to them and can transfer money around that way (just like paypal). It's convenient for them because nobody can get cash out of the banks to spend, even though they have money in the bank. And then they can use this paypal-like service to exchange funds with each other, rather than not being able to get cash out, or not being able to get change (and receiving gum or cigarettes as change instead). 

Pretty straightforward and is good for them. But again, has nothing to do with crypto in any way. ";1;1;False;HugeVagina2;drp43ur;My response to everyone who sold yesterday below 12k;7lnji5;https://i.imgur.com/pPdNZ3c.jpg

"> We could also adopt the concept of ""trusted agreement"" of Lightning Network to crystallize all transactions on the blockchain up to a certain point and then stop including in each node the section of the blockchain before the crystallization

"So here is just a brief thought:
 Exchange and user open a channel that is 1:1. For example: user locks 1 btc and exchange locks 1 btc.
That means that at most the user can double his total btc by buying from the exchange or sell all his coins.
This channel can remain open as long as the user does not want more than 2 btc or if he decides to move his cash to the bank.

"They use rather different approaches, which is probably a good thing this early on. It also helps that all transactions ultimately are validated by full nodes and that there's less global consistency to worry about than with Bitcoin. When a you try to make a transactions and your fellow peers don't do what you expect them to do, your node can just close the channel, and a partioned Lightning network isn't the end of the world.

LND, and the desktop app built on top of it, take advantage of the proposed [neutrino lightweight wallet protocol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FWKc8lM4Ek). This means you can use without your own full node. Probably the easiest to start out with to help testing for that reason.

Downside is that if you do want to run your own full node with lnd, you have to use an experimental [branch of btcd](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/master/docs/INSTALL.md#installing-btcd). This innovation is useful even outside the scope of lightning, so worth helping out testing as well. Hopefully someone will implement it for Bitcoin Core though; it's taking me almost two weeks to sync my btcd node because it hasn't had the same performance improvements. There is a work in progress PR that connects to bitcoin core.

"nope you're wrong.

Let me explain why fees are important
 
The network involves an intrinsically scarce resource which is block space. This resource is intrinsically scarce in the same way that a boat has a load capacity. Go beyond that load capacity and the boat sinks. Likewise, go beyond a certain amount of data in the blockchain and the network sinks by losing its decentralization which is what gives it its security. Consequently, the amount of data that can be processed must remain limited and therefore users must compete over who gets to actually input data into the blockchain.
 
Users compete by essentially paying the miners a bribe, which we call a ""fee."" It is worth noting that in the very early days when bitcoin was unpopular, transactions were free. And transactions would still be free if there weren't so many people trying to get through the door at once. Miners are like bouncers who have to decide who to let in first. Naturally, the best way to get the bouncer to let you in first is to pay him, and that's what we are doing when we pay transaction fees. If fees were based on a fixed percentage, low value transactions with correspondingly low fees would never get confirmed because miners would always favor the higher value transactions with their juicier fees.
 
The blockchain is not designed for cheap low value transactions, it intrinsically favors high value transactions. This is because for high value transactions, the percentage the fee represents is small, whereas for low value transactions the fee quickly becomes a large percentage of the value of the transaction. That is, for high value transactions, fees are cheap, percentage wise. For low value transactions, on the other hand, they are expensive.
 
So it is important to understand that the blockchain is a value transfer layer, and as a value transfer layer it is by its nature designed to favor high value transfers over low value transfers.
 
The more payment networks come to be relied upon for small value transactions -- and the more people use them as opposed to trying to get every transaction into the blockchain directly -- the less people are fighting over the scarce resource known as block space, consequently the cheaper block space becomes. That is, payment networks not only offer a cheap way to transact for low value payments, but they also reduce the costs of high value transactions on the blockchain itself.
 
Roger Ver's confusion -- along with many who agree with him -- is that he thinks of the blockchain as an efficient payment network. It's not. Just look at the electricity expenses that are going into making transactions on the blockchain possible. Right now the network is consuming as much energy as the country Ireland? All that energy is not being spent on making transactions cheap or fast -- additional mining power has a negligible affect on the speed of bitcoin as the protocol always seeks to maintain 10 minute confirmation times, and additional mining power has a negligible affect on the price of fees as that is determined most principally by the fact that there is a limited supply of block space.
 
No. That energy is being spent entirely on securing the network. The blockchain is about security first, not cheap payments. Cheap payments will come with Lightning and other such payment networks, but the purpose of the blockchain is first and foremost about securing a global public ledger.
 
What you want is the security layer to be secure, and the payment layer to be fast and cheap. The two combined (along with so much more) is what will eventually be considered Bitcoin (much like people ceased to differentiate the internet from the web). What you don't want is to try to use the security layer as the payment network so that it isn't secure. And since the blockchain, the security layer as it were, isn't particularly fast or cheap, any network that attempts to use the blockchain as a payment network to compete with networks specifically designed to be payment networks, like Lightning, will in the long run fail.";16;2;False;GalacticCannibalism;drpejyu;⚡️ needs you.

"> Satoshi said

Are you so insecure that you are desperately looking for a new God/Prophet to worship? 

See, the rest of us have moved on and understood the game theoretical implications of Bitcoin better than Satoshi, at least of his understanding when he was still active. I'm sure he now agrees with off-chain scaling, if he's still around and hiding. And the reality is that the Bitcoin network will require essentially a ""healthy"" backlog of unconfirmed txs to keep the miners honest and mining for the benefit of the system.

"Ops another question. Would it be possible to add one of the ideas behind the Lightning network to the idea of bigger block size?

We could increase block size to allow more transactions, less fees and faster confirmation.

We could also adopt the concept of ""trusted agreement"" of Lightning Network to crystallize all transactions on the blockchain up to a certain point and then stop including in each node the section of the blockchain before the crystallization. For example, if there is anonymous consense that transactions before date X are correct, there would be no need to continue adding those transactions to the blockchain downloaded by each node.";1;1;False;botolo;drpf79x;⚡️ needs you.

BCH will beat BTC.


Bitcoin has scaling issues.
Bitcoin has tx fees issues.
We need to improve Lightning Network to overcome the fees of $xx we have today.
We need to achieve the same fees as BCH with Lightning of another Layer solution asap.

Do you see the difference between these?

"> he only difference between these approaches are the transaction validation part

There's big difference between using something like the Neutrino protocol, BIP-37 SPV or directly communicating over RPC, the latter being impractical for mobile. There's also differences in the dependencies and framework they use (which need screening, and might have their own security trade-offs).

"Poor planning, caring about immediate profits as opposed to having even a mid-term plan, not channelling engineering towards scaling their own business with the tested and working tools in hand, instead backing forks that would get them out of this mess they've created.

[Coinbase has a 3.2 million dollar wallet that now it cannot move funds out of](https://twitter.com/LaurentMT/status/943624312304611329), because the whole wallet consists of utxo's averaging $2.2. This is simply because they did not do utxo consolidation, remember that this is not a time sensitive operation and they could have done this on the cheap.

A bitcoin faucet I use used to be able to offer me, up until last week, a free bitcoin withdrawal option once a week because they do utxo consolidation and batch like crazy. It's now unfortunately 3000 satoshis to withdraw now like that because of the immense fees.

Let me give an analogy: Coinbase gets a small room which is just big enough for them. But then they make a mess of it and manage their space really inefficiently. And instead of cleaning up the room they start yelling and screaming that they need a bigger room. The truth is: they will get a bigger room because they grow up and need more space.

"No, core had nothing to with them to not implement batching, or even scheduled input consolidation. If you take the time to think that a free bitcoin faucet can offer 0 fee withdrawals without even Segwit, it's because they did their homework. Coinbase digged themselves into this and are begging for bigger blocks. (I support bigger blocks but not because we need to save Coinbase's back).

Lack of batching whatsoever created themselves a fine grain wallet that they never even consolidated, using existing wallet software. (Use all funds -> send to address), and this is not Core's problem to solve. Batching would require some programming on their side and it's not rocket science, but every once in a while, consolidating your inputs during calm times, is something an ordinary user can plan.

"All nodes are part of consensus. They can and do reject blocks that do not follow the rules. Miners just decide who gets put in a the next block.

The reason everyone doesn't collectively decide on transactions is that scaling it is hard. Every node needs to negotiate transaction validity with every other node. If you have 10k nodes that's 10k^2 negotiations per transaction. So you need more hierarchy (such as PoW). You also have an issue where people start operating nodes to try and influence the network or attack it. So PoW gives you one way to negotiate consensus with less overhead and less attack surface.

That being said PoW is not the end-all be-all final say in how to achieve consensus. What you're describing is probably best implemented by Ripple/Stellar at the moment. These are federated networks with some trusted servers doing consensus and the rest of the network functioning much like regular non-mining nodes on Bitcoin.

"Well, that depends. Maybe you see an error message. Or maybe the opening of the channel fails. Or the client disconnects unexpectedly. If you expend some effort to investigate or fix it yourself and still nothing, you should report it. It could be a bug, or it could be bad UX. Both should and can be fixed.

I will give you an example of the bug I found: When I tried to close the channel, in some cases the channel would close only on one side and not the other and the logs contained an error message that the signature was invalid (see https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/issues/502)";38;3;False;mtaborsky;drp3snj;⚡️ needs you.

"Also, from a commenter higher up (and I'm resharing because it opened my mind):

""Let me explain why fees are important
The network involves an intrinsically scarce resource which is block space. This resource is intrinsically scarce in the same way that a boat has a load capacity. Go beyond that load capacity and the boat sinks. Likewise, go beyond a certain amount of data in the blockchain and the network sinks by losing its decentralization which is what gives it its security. Consequently, the amount of data that can be processed must remain limited and therefore users must compete over who gets to actually input data into the blockchain.
Users compete by essentially paying the miners a bribe, which we call a 'fee'.""";2;0;False;de_la_guerre;drph00b;⚡️ needs you. Yes, you.;7lui2v;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7lui2v/needs_you_yes_you/

"This is only tangentially related, but I think there's also a need for educational resources.  If you're setting up and testing out, pay attention to any parts of the process that are confusing or unclear, because ironing those out is critical in terms of end-user adoption.

Bitcoin itself is no easy thing to use, for most people.  Hopefully it's possible to use LN without first having to understand Bitcoin in any depth.  Some guides that explain the concepts and execution in a way anyone can understand would go a long way.  I think a lot of people have heard of LN, but don't really know how they would use it, or what they would use it for.

"Can someone answer me this 1 question?


You tie up say 1 BTC in a Lightning channel. Takes a few days to get in the channel because well the network will still be clogged (don't kid yourself 7tx/sec is terrible even with 8MB blocks it's only 56). Great now you can spend it fairly easily, quickly and cheaply. Now, uh oh, the channel unexpectedly closed. You'll get your remaining balance back eventually. But in the meantime you have no funds to spend and even if you did have reserved coins it'll still take a while + fees to open another channel. 

It's like locking up your debt card for a few days while you wait a week for a new one in the mail.

"One of the best ways to help prepare for the Lightning Network is to make sure you're ready to run a secure node and teaching others to do the same. Receiving payments on the Lightning Network requires that the recipient's node be online with autonomous access to the unencrypted private keys used to manage its payment channels. There is a substantial difference in the security requirements of an LN node compared to holding a Bitcoin wallet or even full node. Nothing will undermine public confidence in LN faster than if a widespread malware outbreak ends up stealing funds from early adopters. The pervasive data breaches across companies large and small demonstrate that most are not yet prepared for the responsibility that awaits them when Lightning strikes. The community must act now to promote strong security or look on as LN flashes and fades, leaving only the rumble of disillusioned supporters.

"For anyone reading this concerned about the state of bitcoin and this sub:

There have been posts that complain about this sub turning into a meme and greed sub. That there is no more discussions about improving the technology or about uniting the community. Now, take a look at the comment I'm responding to and just think about why this sub is the way it is.

The OP (original post) is about the technology and is asking for the community to contribute testing the lighting network. If you haven't already, you should try it out and witness how amazing and real it is. You'll realize that scaling is possible and being worked on. 

This sub is filled with spammers, trolls, and lil FUDsters. It always has been. However, this space has grown and attracted a lot more people. Some new, some good, some bad, some close minded, some short sighted, etc. 

The point of my comment is to highlight the comments/posts that contribute nothing to Bitcoin's progress. Anytime you see some ""alarming"" or ""warning"" or the-sky-is-falling type content, take it with caution. This post is specifically about advancing the technology and the comment I'm responding to highjacked the top comment to sneak in a snarky, obvious remark and goes as far as to provide ""proof"".

"Wrong.
From a commenter a bit up higher:

Let me explain why fees are important
The network involves an intrinsically scarce resource which is block space. This resource is intrinsically scarce in the same way that a boat has a load capacity. Go beyond that load capacity and the boat sinks. Likewise, go beyond a certain amount of data in the blockchain and the network sinks by losing its decentralization which is what gives it its security. Consequently, the amount of data that can be processed must remain limited and therefore users must compete over who gets to actually input data into the blockchain.
Users compete by essentially paying the miners a bribe, which we call a ""fee...";3;0;False;de_la_guerre;drpgwzn;⚡️ needs you. Yes, you.;7lui2v;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7lui2v/needs_you_yes_you/

"> All feedback is welcome but crash/loss of funds is what we really are after atm.

People can probably live with UX inconveniences, if it means much lower fees and faster transactions, but lost funds are unacceptable, I'm not really experienced at programming, but I like tinkering and I have a lot of free time, gonna report all bugs that I find.    

Hmmm... it'll probably be a good idea to record everything and supply short video examples in case somethings goes wrong.
