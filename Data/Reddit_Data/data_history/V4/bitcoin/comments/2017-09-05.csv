The market trends upward over time.

A wise investment is one which has consistent returns and value so that you can liquidate easily when you want to.

If I do python version then Raspberry pi would make sense. But even then API keys are vulnerable if someone steals your Rasperry pi... the only secure way would be require you to enter password when starting app on Rasperry pi and keep decrypted API keys in RAM.

Ideal solution if you ask me is for GDax to directly support autobuys through their website. Maybe if /u/CB-Dave or /u/coblee end up reading this and they point it to Coinbase dev team it'll happen.

"Fees are one of the key reasons I did this. When you buy through Coinbase there was like $0.15 + 3% fee for transaction. So you can't easily set $1 daily buy.

With GDax you deposit say $30 through ACH on which there is NO FEE. And then you pay like $0.02 per transaction. I just looked my transaction from today... I've bought $10 worth of Bitcoin and fee was $0.012.

"Yeah but people who ""play"" the markets are doing nothing but gambling. That's not investing. An investment is something that has inherent value (ideally where your money goes to help fund improvements) and isn't just a gamble on someone else eventually paying a higher price than you did. Land is an investment. Comic books are not. Certificates of Deposit, yes. Classic cars, no.  Mutual funds, yes. Gold, no. 

I'd support a restructuring of the tax system to discourage random betting in secondary markets. It would push silly people with more money than sense to buy things with actual value (where the value isn't based solely on fiat and other people's stupidity.) This kind of ""investing"" is a zero-sum game where some people get lucky. It's a sucker bet. Bitcoin is no better than buying Beanie Babies.

No, *you're* making no sense. You're arguing that caffeine is worse because people consume more of it and it's easier to consume a lot. You're forgetting that people don't consume nicotine only via cigarette. You can control how much nicotine is in your vape, for example. Also, I wasn't arguing which is done in higher amounts, I was arguing which is worse. Being lethal in smaller doses scores highly with me in terms of which is worse. Fentanyl is considered one of the worst things to cut heroin with because a very small dose can kill someone.;1;1;False;YuriDiAAAAAAAAAAAAAA;dmkzyj9;I will buy 10$ of bitcoin everyday instead of my daily cigarettes !;6y1hx4;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6y1hx4/i_will_buy_10_of_bitcoin_everyday_instead_of_my/

You're making no sense, nicotine is done in much smaller amounts then caffeine. it would take like 100 or more cigarettes smoked consecutively to give you nicotine poisoning, and probably only like 30-50 coffees to make you overdose on caffeine.  Caffeine is dosed in much higher amounts, so even though a gram of nicotine would kill you, a single cigarette only has like 5-10mg of nicotine and you don't even absorb that much when you smoke it, where as a cup of coffee can have 150mg of more of caffeine.  ;2;1;False;omgurheadsgone;dmkx3fs;I will buy 10$ of bitcoin everyday instead of my daily cigarettes !;6y1hx4;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6y1hx4/i_will_buy_10_of_bitcoin_everyday_instead_of_my/

"**Nicotine poisoning**

Nicotine poisoning describes the symptoms of the toxic effects of nicotine following ingestion, inhalation, or skin contact. Nicotine poisoning can potentially be deadly, though serious or fatal overdoses are rare. Historically, most cases of nicotine poisoning have been the result of use of nicotine as an insecticide. More recent cases of poisoning typically appear to be in the form of Green Tobacco Sickness, or due to accidental ingestion of tobacco or tobacco products or consumption of nicotine-containing plants.

"> Seriously though, some of it isn't as complex and scary as it seems. 

Perhaps not to you, but to this poster?

> Where can I learn about buying bitcoin and/or other cryptocurrency? I can Google it, but if you can point me to something that is actually accurate and understandable, that would help a lot. Also, how much to you have to invest initially?

This reads like the sort of person that asks ""Should I buy XYZ? How much will it go up?"" and then loses their child's college funds.

...I'll go one step further and add, because I've *never* seen it mentioned anywhere before, cryptocurrencies are addictive. There is an appeal to trading in crypto that is not unlike gambling, of the worst kind. All the pretty colours and exotic names, the sudden wins and losses. Yeah? Serious question.

You could at least argue comfortably that bitcoin is the furthest removed from that arena.

"Don't mistake an exchange for your wallet, even if they claim they'll provide ""an online wallet"" for you.

Exchange can give you an account and keep track of *balances* associated with that account for trading, but you can't *own* anything in an exchange.

Coinbase decides what you get to do with your *balance*, because they control all the actual currency.

While exchanges provide a very valuable and convenient trading service, they don't have the kind of regulation and insurances banks do and require a significant amount of trust from you.

Exchanges are also *extremely* lucrative targets for criminals. I've personally lost BTC I'll never see again thanks to an exchange being hacked a few years back, regardless of all the ""bank-like"" security measures like single sign-in codes.

This is why you should withdraw the currency from the exchange into your own wallet for storage.

Such wallet can be [software, hardware or even paper](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet), the important bit is that you alone hold the private key to control the actual currency. Then nobody can deny you access to the currency, even if the exchange goes down.

Now all that being said, exchanges are still a good thing and it's reasonable to trust them a little. A business like Coinbase or Kraken isn't run by amateurs, they take security seriously and stealing your coins would do more harm than good for them.

It's perfectly reasonable to have small sums of currency in an exchange for a little while if you are intending to trade them soon, but if you've got a significant amount of Bitcoin or any cryptocurrency, it's *really* dumb risk to let an exchange hold them.";4;0;False;Voidsheep;dml2qgo;I will buy 10$ of bitcoin everyday instead of my daily cigarettes !;6y1hx4;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6y1hx4/i_will_buy_10_of_bitcoin_everyday_instead_of_my/

"Coinbase is utter shit . once bought 100€ worth of BTC before its value increased(200-300%) . not only did i have to wait several weeks to get my BTC , they also gave me less than 100€ at the price it was weeks after originally paying for my BTC(So alot less BTC than i originally bought ) . 

So in the end they screwed me . Since i got <95€ worth of BTC after the value increase . if i would have recieved it when i purchased it , i would have had somewhere between 250€-270€ . 

And if it werent for me spamming their facebook and twitter after 1-2 weeks of having no response through their costumer ""service""(Dont expect a quick reaction , they dont care if you need support , they'll take their time screwing you over) , they prob wouldnt have done shit, marked my closed my ticket and kept the money. 

So fuck coinbase . bunch of unprofessional scamming fucks . 

PS; Dont let someone else hold your BTC and Just make your own wallet , it aint hard and its something you should learn how to do when you want to buy BTC . I personally buy from anycoindirect but they are only available in certain countries . somewhat expensive but their costumer service deserves a 10/10 rating.

"It's easy to find articles that tell you what to do, but then you're still putting trust in the authors of those articles, and the authors of the software they tell you to use. Just the other day, the first search result for Bittrex was a phishing site... How do newbies know who they can trust? They've already implicitly trusted Coinbase with their USD in order to buy-in, so trusting them to store their coins safely is a minimal escalation of that trust.

Not to mention, storing your seed in a way that is both secure and accessible to you is a non-trivial problem. If you forget your Coinbase password, you can restore access within a few days. If you lose access to your seed, your coins are gone. See the guy a couple days ago that lost access to his coins even after taking precautions to setup redundant backups, just because he inadvertently reverted his Keepass keystore.";2;0;False;farsightxr20;dmkvuad;I will buy 10$ of bitcoin everyday instead of my daily cigarettes !;6y1hx4;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6y1hx4/i_will_buy_10_of_bitcoin_everyday_instead_of_my/

"> Lol Fentanyl is lethal in the 1 milligram range so 1/1000th of a gram. How can you even compare that to something lethal in the gram range like nicotine

I didn't. I just said that things that are lethal in small doses is something to consider when comparing drugs. A drug like fentanyl is scary for that reason. Mortality rates in small doses ranks highly to me as to which one is worse. I think you'd be better off vaping caffeine than nicotine, for the aforementioned reason. 

You're fighting a losing battle here, because I have my criteria for what constitutes a worse drug, and you have yours.

"> the trick is to find a replacement. like unhealthy food. or heroin.

shitposting on reddit is pretty addictive judging from the amount of garbage here.

But on the real, I saw a interesting study that something as simple as perspective can greatly increase the possibility for success in quitting. For example, instead of saying ""Im never going to smoke again"" they found that people who instead said ""I dont need it now, maybe later"" had much greater success rates.

Something about the way the human mind works.

I never got too deep in smoking, but I found when I stopped smoking that smoking weed greatly reduced cravings. I know that may seem like a 1:1 trade to some people, but weed is much less toxic than cigarettes and a much healthier alternative. Just dont roll blunts and smoke 2 grams every time and you'll come out improved. Then once you are no longer physically dependent upon nicotine, you can kick the non-addictive weed habit.

"Thanks, this looks great!

I am very recently thinking of doing this. But I was thinking of doing it using Python. Two quick questions. 
1. do you just pick the highest bid price at the moment of execution? I can imagine that there is risk of the price moving quickly so the order either never gets filled or gets filled with the market taker fee. Do you run into these problems?

2. What environment do you use to run the app? I think it probably isn't safe to put the API key on a server.

"Lol Fentanyl is lethal in the 1 milligram range so 1/1000th of a gram. How can you even compare that to something lethal in the gram range like nicotine, so 1000x less dangerous. No one accidentally consumes a gram of nicotine unless they are trying to purposely do it.  Most e liquid comes in 3-12mg per millimetre sizes, and 30ml can last you weeks as you can only only put a few millilitres into a vape device.  This isn't some chemical where skin contact could be dangerous, 1 gram of pure nicotine would be a lot of powder, where as a lethal dose of fentanyl would be like a grain of salts worth, big difference. 

Yes caffeine would require a bigger amount to cause an overdose, but it is also dispensed in much higher amounts typically, you can even buy straight 200mg caffeine tablets. Nicotine is dispensed in much lower amounts so unless you are purposely trying to harm yourself you would never accidentally take a whole gram of something, and the person could do the same thing with caffeine to harm themselves if that was their goal.

As far as health effects go, I don't think pure nicotine when vaped is any more bad for you then caffeine.  Nicotine may be addicting but it's not what causes all the problems that come from smoking cigarettes. Those are caused by the other chemicals found in cigarettes and the tar inhaled when you smoke something. 

I would say vaping nicotine is no more worse for your health then drinking coffee. Caffeine can also be very addicting and has a bad physical withdrawal as well if you take it every single day for a long period of time, reported withdrawal include horrible headaches, sluggishness and fatigue, lack of appetite and all kinds of other negative things when they go a day or two without it.

"Between January 1st 2016 and Today there have been numerous changes which have sparked interest in Bitcoin resulting in more buyers, more scarcity, and a higher price.

The most notable changes from my perspective have been:

1. The US SEC's review, rejection, and [secondary review of a the Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/25/bitcoin-flying-as-etf-gets-second-shot.html)
2. [The UN experimenting with using Ethereum as a method of distributing secure ""coupons"" of value](https://www.coindesk.com/united-nations-sends-aid-to-10000-syrian-refugees-using-ethereum-blockchain/)
3. [Papers being released by the UN's research institute discussing blockchain tech](http://www.unrisd.org/brett-scott)
4. Legislation both completed or in the planning stages which opens legal access to crypto currencies to people in multiple countries in the Asia/Pacific region.
5. The successful activation of Segwit (regardless of how you feel about it)
6. The successful fork of Bitcoin Cash without major price volatility proving the stability of the system (regardless of how you feel about Bitcoin Cash)
7. The continued Venezuelan currency crisis.
8. Public recognition of and support for currencies with privacy support like Monero and [ZCash in popular media](http://www.radiolab.org/story/ceremony/) resulting in more buys of Bitcoin (since bitcoin is one of the few methods to reliably trade into many altcoins).
9. Fear of the current state of US political relations reducing the buying power of the dollar driving people to hard assets such as gold and bitcoin.
10. A healthy dose of people who don't know the above riding FOMO into a technology they do not understand.

Short version: More public exposure in the past year than in the previous few years combined. More interest and more people who can legally access it. All of that combined with fear of war, catastrophe, or fear of missing out.";9;1;False;Pj7d62Qe9X;dmkgi5i;I will buy 10$ of bitcoin everyday instead of my daily cigarettes !;6y1hx4;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6y1hx4/i_will_buy_10_of_bitcoin_everyday_instead_of_my/

Try some tx's yourself and say this again. I have made several tx's this week and none of them were even close to $10. The thing about Bitcoin is...

">""China bans ICOs. That's not something a formula can predict.""

If there's a worse example of trying to equate an external event with ""ultimate unpredictability"", I can't think of one. Everyone has been saying everywhere that China will do some kind of regulatory thing that will affect Bitcoin's price, and even people who aren't being that specific have been saying the ICO craze will result in a big correction at some point. 

Any person who bought Bitcoin without considering how this could affect their investment in the short to medium term can't say ""Oh man, China banned ICOs, what a rotten bit of luck!""

I get it: You're trying to explain that Bitcoin's price is so unpredictable that committing a large investment to Bitcoin is functionally the same as gambling in a casino. It isn't because there is no meta-game happening here, where some other player (the house, a government, a shadow cabal of cypherpunks, whatever) ultimately wins over the long term no matter what you do.

I do agree that you or I sitting at home at a single PC have little hope of being able to predict Bitcoin's crests and dips. But what I am predicting, right here right now, is that one day soon we will have (well, rich people will have) AIs that analyse millions upon millions of data points - from political opinion polls to recent harvests to consumer confidence to text-analysis of the President's speeches, to how long the average commute was that morning, to the amount of opiate in sewage water (indicating usage levels in general public) to 'comfort rating' of current weather in key markets, all this stuff will go into the pot and the AI will make thousands of tiny purchases and sales, such that the longer the AI operates in the market, the more its purchasing behaviour matches the actual cost of Bitcoin (or whatever it is buying.)

There is no point assigning an AI to the lottery because there really is no way to make a meaningfully useful prediction of which ball is going to fall out of the barrel first. 

Also, maybe go and look up what a ""straw man"" is huh? Refresh your memory. Because just yelling ""OMG you disagree with me? Straw man!"" makes you look stupid.

"> I get it: You're trying to explain that Bitcoin's price is so unpredictable that committing a large investment to Bitcoin is functionally the same as gambling in a casino.

This is a straw man.  I never once said this.  I was not ""redefining"" my use of the word ""gambling,"" and, in fact, it was YOU who accused me of meaning one particular thing that I didn't mean.

All investments, including and especially crypto currency investments, are gambling, because there is chance, randomness, and a lack of absolute predictability.  Crypto, in particular, is highly volatile, and makes it more of a gamble than other forms of investment.  Gambling doesn't mean you can't win, or that you can't improve your odds by some means.

You seem to have taken particular offense to this notion.";1;0;False;HeroofTime55;dmkui3u;Patiently waiting on this pullback...;6xdv4t;https://i.redd.it/s205xup399jz.jpg
"Again with the straw man that I am comparing this to a casino.  I am not.  I have not.  YOU are constructing that straw man against me.  I have not made such a comparison.  A straw man is when you accuse me of an argument I have not made, in order to make it easier to take down the fake argument, rather than my actual argument.  It's not ""just because you disagree with me,"" it's because you're constructing an actual straw man.

I do not dispute that you can look at various factors and improve your odds, even significantly.  And you speak of an AI that is really, really good at determining the odds.  But at the end of the day, it is still just odds - probability.  No matter how much you boil down as much information as possible, there will always be randomness.  Even if you have perfect information about the molecular arrangement inside the President's skull, there is still randomness and unpredictability.  There is still chance.  It is still a gamble, even if you make it a safe gamble.

We have much bigger concerns than the price of Bitcoin when AI gets that powerful.  ";1;1;False;HeroofTime55;dmksix4;Patiently waiting on this pullback...;6xdv4t;https://i.redd.it/s205xup399jz.jpg
"> Any decision is gambling

Your simplistic statement that started it all. I defined Bitcoin in terms of the kinds of gambling it WASN'T. That is to say, lottery and casino. 

You wanted to redefine your use of gambling to just mean ""unpredictable"" but you couldn't resist mentioning that exchanges and brokers take a cut:

> Not all gambling involves a house that takes a cut, either. If a group of friends gather to play poker, it's still gambling. Which doesn't apply here anyway because Bitcoin brokers do take a cut, as does the network itself...

So you say there IS a ""house"" that's taking a cut. And I responded to that by pointing out that yeah but it's still not like a casino because no long-odds that favour the house etc.

Just because I aim pointing out how Bitcoin is not like a casino, does not mean that you think it is a casino. 

This is not ""straw man"".
