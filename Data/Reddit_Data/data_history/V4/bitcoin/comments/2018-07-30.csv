"**Big Mac Index**

The Big Mac Index is published by The Economist as an informal way of measuring the purchasing power parity (PPP) between two currencies and provides a test of the extent to which market exchange rates result in goods costing the same in different countries. It ""seeks to make exchange-rate theory a bit more digestible"".The index, created in 1986, takes its name from the Big Mac, a hamburger sold at McDonald's restaurants.

The Bitcoin is very clearly and interestingly deflationary. The concepts of inflation, deflation, and 'backing' are all quite in this realm. This McDonnald's coin is a currency issued by a private party who is backing that currency. It's not like that company is trying to make a currency, but they might have done so on accident just like gift cards are used as a form of currency in some countries with weak government-issued money. 

Happy to also make a case for wanting money that's anti-inflation, which is sort of the basis of wanting money backed by something that can't just be hand-waved to existence (either special gold atoms which are hard to forge or burgers which take energy).

Fiat: I will accept this fiat for my goods and services because I know that others will accept it for their goods and services.

Gold: I will accept this gold for my goods and services because I know that others will accept it for their goods and services.

It has no inherent value other than people agree that it has value.  It seems to me that the the only thing with true inherent value are goods and services themselves.

"> The Bitcoin is very clearly and interestingly deflationary

**It is not interestingly deflationary.** It follows the same rule that most deflationary currencies follow. There is a finite amount of it.

> This McDonnald's coin is a currency issued by a private party who is backing that currency. It's not like that company is trying to make a currency, but they might have done so on accident just like gift cards are used as a form of currency in some countries with weak government-issued money

**You can label anything with value some sort of a currency if you really wanted to.** You don't really see gift cards having an impact on the economy either. They are valued in relation to the fiat currency it is representing so it is directly tied to that currency.

Example: Gift cards (x) are only equal to the fiat currency they represent. They are not standalone currencies and do not fluctuate in value. When you buy a $50 xbox live gift card, it remains worth $50. It does not change.

> Happy to also make a case for wanting money that's anti-inflation, which is sort of the basis of wanting money backed by something that can't just be hand-waved to existence (either special gold atoms which are hard to forge or burgers which take energy).

If you haven't taken a modern economics course, you probably would believe that deflation is good because uncontrolled inflation is bad. This is wrong. For a better explanation, you should probably take some economics courses but for simplisticty, 

**Controlled inflation allows fiat currency to remain balanced and more stable than a currency that is uncontrolled. Do you know how hard it would be for most people to do finances if the value of USD changed drastically every day. Not only is that a problem, but controlled inflation encourages economic growth through encouraging spending. You can say all you want about bitcoin but as a single currency, it would be very bad for the economy. People would realize that over time it will just gain value and people will begin to hoard bitcoin (as we already see today). Thus, people stop spending and the economy begins to collapse. I mean, you can't even argue with this because its currently seen today. Most people that own bitcoin own it as an investment and most people never spend it.**";6;1;False;;e3azyyd;So they agree that fiat currency has no value anymore.;933bnu;https://i.redd.it/ozij0ypxn2d11.jpg

Money is anything of value that can be exchanged. It helps if it is standard. It also helps if it is divisible. But most of all it helps if the value it represents is inherent not denoted as there is no need to earn or maintain trust. So if there were state issued tamper proof standard gold coins of say a gram each then those would be a great form of money. A dollar is not backed by gold, but it is backed by trust won over many years of stability. So while it can lose all value suddenly, that would lay waste all the effort put into earning such trust. A big mac coupon or coin is also inherently worthless if McDonald's decides to withdraw the redemption offer or if the offer lapses on its own. In short both dollar and big mac coin can lose value suddenly but the latter is more likely to do so. If someone offers a dollar equivalent for the coin, go for it. That said, things are a bit more complicated. With denoted money you are able to participate in group logic scenarios. With trustless money, not at all. In the sense that with denoted money, you are trusting others to manage the real value (mostly it works against you but that's subjective).;1;0;False;panjwani_ajay;e3b1nit;So they agree that fiat currency has no value anymore.;933bnu;https://i.redd.it/ozij0ypxn2d11.jpg

Great question. The only issue with the BigMac coin is the counter party risk of McDonalds.

"I'll buy your no-value USD for nothing in exchange, if you say it's worth nothing and has no value... why not give it to me? Because as long as people believe in it, that's enough to give it value. What's more important is the exchange of goods and services, the trades we do between oneanother. What currency needs to do is just keep an accurate representation of any given trade in numbers, so it's easy to keep track of and count. So then, the USD and any other currency serves their purposes, even if they no longer hold gold in reserve that the paper banknotes could be exchanged for.

It's the same reason why bitcoin's price is so high, is because there's someone willing to pay x ammount(whatever it's worth now) for it.  The USD and any other national currency will hold their value as long as people are gonna work their backs off for it, or mortgage their homes for an x ammount of $ loans, to sell any of their belongings for that currency, or to start a venture/business/travel etc whaever. 

A currency is characterised as it's ease of acceptance (what % of the people you need to trade with will accept x currency vs y currency) In this regard, the USD is still king.

"Think of it this way, if you hodl bigmaccoin™ it will always be worth 1 big Mac, no matter what a big Mac sells for in Fiat. So big Mac coin will always hold it's value relative to a big Macs value in dollars. 

Backing a currency just means that your currency is always able to be exchanged for what's backing it.  This works in this case as McDonald's is not likely to be unable to make a big Mac when you turn one in. Now if for whatever reason they made billions of these things, it could lose it's backing if everyone all turned their coins in at once, and thats pretty much what Happened to the dollar.
