The reason Bitcoin price is so high is because some of us see much more in it than just a currency. A different way to look at it is that blockchains are digital value storage devices in the same way hard drives store information. It allows ways to directly interact and program digital value in ways we cannot comprehend. No one knows what applications will emerge, but it will make creating, transferring, storing, and programming digital value much easier. What are things with digital value? It could be anything a currency, a song, an event ticket, or even ownership to a physical object. When all these different blockchains like Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc interconnect we will have the Internet of Value. At some point most things that have digital value will be created on blockchains as it makes interacting with digital value much more feature rich. So yes, Bitcoin and its ilk will make your life much more easier in the future, but of course before that happens cryptocurrency must be widely adopted. ;1;0;False;escapevelo;dh9tqsz;Amazing bitcoin billboard near LAX!;69mugf;https://i.redd.it/f4dmhdwzexvy.jpg

"I just saw a lot of misunderstanding here, that I feel I can clear out a bit for you, so here's my few cents:

> The whole limited number of bitcoins thing also makes me confused. What happens when bitcoins stop being generated, why would a miner continue to mine without getting paid. Wouldn't the fees for transactions explode, as the number of bitcoins dwindle (since there's no getting back ?

Actually the furute of bitcoin is still not clear, but they are a lot of approaches to solve this, like Lighting Network (where blockchain would mostly be used as settlement layer and the transactions would be happening outside of it, so the fees would be divided since one blockchain transactions would mean many more real transactions. They would still be secure and trustless, but that's a very wide topic, so you can read about it somewhere by yourself if you're interested) or simply - bigger blocks (which would mean more transactions in one block, so the fees would not need to be so high, cuz there could be more transactions in each block. Even today the network is full of transactions that are not immiedietly confirmed, so increasing the block size would mean a miner could put more transactions into the block and make more profit without the need for fees to get higher. And it is expected that in the future there will be probably much more people using bitcoin than today, since it's still a relatively new technology).

> I don't know what bitcoin is backed by, can you tell me?

The network, the electricity and time that is used to mine it, kind of... rareness? (limited supply that can't be tampered)... You can come up with many things. Mostly by idea and people's believes, as everything is.

> Don't I have to pay a fee to buy bitcoin (and give some very personal details)? Isn't that like at least a 10% transaction fee after taking that into account?

Well... no. There are many ways to buy bitcoin. Online exchanges are probably the most popular and if you choose to buy them there, you surely do have to give personal information (but that would be the case with most things that you want to buy on the internet I suppose ;)). But 10% transaction fee? Never heared of that. Transaction fees there are usually like 0,1-0,5%.

> Great! How do I cash out? Oh right...10% transaction fee.

As I said before, there are many ways to buy bitcoin, and so there are many ways to sell it. If you wish to do it on some online exchange, the transaction fee would be probably like 0,1-0,5% and you would also need to pay withdrawal fee, which is mostly like 1%, but depends on the exchange really.

Besides, if you want to buy bitcoin just to move money from place A to place B and than cash out immiedietly than you don't really take full advantage of it as a means of payment by itself, do you? Sure, maybe there are not too many places where you can buy things with bitcoin right now, but there are more and more every year. As I said, this is a relatively new technology.

> Don't I have to trust the exchanges and the person selling me stuff to send me the stuff?

That's the case with everything you buy or sell. I think the point is - once someone sends bitcoins to you and the transaction have a few confirmations on the blockchain, you don't have to trust anyone that you own those bitcoins. There is no bank or middle man that keeps them for you. They are pretty much ""locked"" in the network, unless suddenly most of the miners decide to mine against you and that would probably never be profitable to anyone and yea... I don't think it ever happened.

> Can't I, by the same token lose everything because I lost a hard drive or backup? Or hackers getting into my pc?

You can drop a hundred dollars on the street, but whose fault will be that?

> Don't I have to get them at an exchange, where they ask for my ID?

As I said - there are many ways to get them. Quick example: Bitcoin ATM.

> Is that guaranteed?

No, it's actually bullshit. It usally takes 10 minutes for 1 confirmation. It may take more or less. With each confirmation it becomes more secure. In 30-60 minutes it usually becomes quite safe. Exchanges would mostly rely on 3 confimations for example.

> Don't care (about open-source)

That's the only reason this technology even makes sense. But I get that you may not quite understand that.

> So who are the fees I am paying to going?

If you mean transaction fees - it's not like someone cuts the way of your transaction to take the fee. You decide what fee will be and send it with the transaction to encourage miners to include it in the next block. They are not the middle man in the sense that they ever directly recieve the amount you sent. Just the fee. The Open Source code that you so much do not care about makes sure of that.

> I can carry my credit card or debit card on me anywhere in the world.

True. The difference is, if you have your bitcoin private key with you by any means and an internet connection (true, you need that), noone can really stop you from using them at this point, since, as I said - there is no middle man in bitcoin. Only huge, decentralized network. If you have a credit card, your bank can always refuse to make the transaction or lock your card for some reason. You only have a tool that can allow you to access your money. But that depends on your bank, too. If you have your bitcoin private key, internet connection, some device and the right knowleage, you do not really depend on anyone. It's a bit closer to having physical cash.

> So if somebody finds out my public key, they can see everything I've ever bought?

Maybe not that, but they could probably figure some things out. Depends on your knowleage of the blockchain and how you use it really.

> Internet access (as point of failure)

These days doesn't seem to be much of a problem, does it?

> Why would I WANT deflation in a currency?

Why would you want inflation?

> If the person has received the cash why would they provide the service? 

That's also the case with every form of currency. With credit card you chose to use a middle man, and with bitcoin you can do it also. But with bitcoin you may program some stuff, so that for example - if a transaction has 3 confirmations something is automatically sent to you (like an online good). Such program could also be Open Source so you could compile it yourself and be sure that it works this way. That's just an example.

> So why would I as a consumer in the US use bitcoin? That's probably a better question

Right now? I don't know. As an investment and store of value maybe (not the only one of course). I'd say it's a technology with great potential and a lot of possible future use cases. You can read some books about it and decide for yourself. I wouldn't judge it just by the usability it has as of today.

"in a perfect world, yes. 

the cynical view is that, in the future, even with full adoption of crypto, it will be just as it is today; the very few possess the lion's share of the wealth, the rest have very little.

luxury communism would be great, but when i look at the USA right now, with their rising oligarchy, i dont hold much faith for any thye of economic utopia for a long time, crypto adoption or not.

just my view, i am a disappointed idealist.

mostly, my original comment was about the problems facing crypto seeing mass adoption. i didnt even mention security. stolen crypto is really prohibitive to new adopters. ive heard every argument about how one must take responsibility etc etc etc, but every new user who loses coins to a hack is more likely than not to walk away for good. its a big problem.";2;1;False;GoggyMagogger;dh9mlfa;Amazing bitcoin billboard near LAX!;69mugf;https://i.redd.it/f4dmhdwzexvy.jpg
