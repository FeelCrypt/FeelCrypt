"Our government is by the consent of the governed. It's not just an arbitrary affair. A citizen accepts his obligation and the government sets it politically. In Sumer it would have sounded like this: you can have land and the means to work it for a portion of your harvest on the threshing floor. A nomad could enter into this arrangement. We get into a similar arrangement. Ours goes like this: if you accept to be citizen you will have a well defined set of protections of your rights and a system of laws will oversee it all. You will be able to deal in the shared obligation of others with money that is politically defined to be the only thing that will settle your obligation. 

If you want to understand why money has value you must understand that it has so out of your obligation. Your fellow citizen's obligation to his government can be monetized and given to you who then owns the exact value of his obligation because that is enforced by law. All the games people play with money are based in a fundamental agreed upon obligation that is not arbitrary. I know what my obligations are. The government let's me know ahead of time what they are. Things like my labor can then be valued by me in accordance with whether or not that is sufficient. Obligation underpins the value of everything that money then prices in a standardized fashion.

Bitcoin has no fundamental obligation attached to it. It could. A government could declare it the only way to settle obligation to it and then it would move into being a standard of value. The problem with that is that this goes against the Bitcoin philosophy of being controlled and centralized. Bitcoin, just like everything else that we are not obliged to partake in trades as a commodity that we value against our standard of value which is government money within a country.";1;1;False;sweetsmellingrosie;e1hvgkp;Mark these wise words;8ucnu6;https://i.redd.it/13jz54lmjl611.jpg

I'm over 50 of that helps you. Been there, done that. Have owned all sorts of assets and have only ever made a degree of serious well being for myself by using the nature of fiat to the end that is was meant for. I borrowed from myself and paid back. I never had to turn to a billionaire to ask him for a loan under his terms. A bank just deposited the money in my account and took my word + some interest that I would pay it back to make things come out in the wash. Today the money is long gone. It vanished when it was paid back to cancel the obligation. I never brought new money into being except for the time period I also had a counterpart in obligation. It always summed to zero. Everyone else's ability to borrow from themselves rose the price of my assets to such a degree that I became richer without working. It is amazing what fiat has done and continues to do for me. Every person born today has the same opportunity to borrow from his future revenues. What is most scary is that a lot of people would want to destroy this sort of thing so that young people would have to turn to existing piles of wealth to borrow from it or work in the service of it.

Rome ran their economy on slavery. And believe me, you had plenty of obligations in Rome too. The nature of the token behind money is unimportant. It can be silver, gold, turkey feathers or fiat and that changes nothing. You can count money with anything, including virtual numbers. Money needs not be in hard form. At the core the representation of money is just how we count or account for it. In a fiat system you still trade in the obligation. To have money it must have a counterpart in debt. The debt is the obligation that gives value. No obligation= no money. Gold and silver are hoardable and of no use to run economies on. Even when there was a gold standard people were trading in fiat gold reserves. There is simply too little of it to be useful as a counting token. A virtual contract existed to make you feel like you owned gold. France once cashed in that contract and demanded gold the US did not have. The US immediately saw fit to scrap that primitive system. Gold and silver failed for Rome too. In the end Rome collapsed because it failed to be able to enforce any obligation by force. There's Roman money buried all over the place.

A commodity used as a currency in one market transaction is not a standard of value. It is an agreed upon market exchange value. 

I haven't invented any of this. There are objective ways to explain all these concepts that are well understood by the people who bother to look into it.

The hard trick that Bitcoin believers have to perform is convincing anyone of how a commodity becomes a standard of value without any sort of obligation attached to it. It will not distinguish itself from gold or turkey feathers because there is no agent of force attached to Bitcoin to make everyone value it and trade in that value.

It did not function. That is why it was abandoned. Today it could not work. At very specific time people understood that if they were going to be trading fiat gold contracts they may as well be trading just fiat. That was a correct conclusion. Today no one is limited from borrowing from someone who has money. They can borrow from themselves and their future incomes as long as they pay interest to make it worth someone's while to hold the debt obligation. There is no need for any great big stockpile of money to exist to have anyone borrow it. A world today based in a a rare currency would mean a drastic loss of affluence for almost everyone. As I've said before, even if Bitcoin was brought into the realm of being money it would trade just like fiat with all sorts of fiat Bitcoin contracts associated with it.

When was the last occurrence of a government running its economy on a commodity currency? I tell you it was gold and that fiat contracts in gold was a part of it. Commodities as currencies are not workable. They are not easily sourced. They are inefficient because they need energy inputs. They are unequally distributed. They are of short supply. They are hoardable. The only economy you will ever run with commodity currency token is a very small one where there will be great inequality. Kings would love it, but Kings are long gone. We all gave up this notion in the 20th century, so by any reasonable person's argument it failed to serve us past that point without the fiat notion. Bitcoin is the new heir  to gold's old promise, limited in quantity and hoardable. It has all the shortcomings we threw gold out the window for. But, I do understand the appeal to a hoarder who thinks he can get the entire economy priced in it if he can just destroy obligation to government. That's Peter Schiff again.

So if you think Bitcoin will become successful just as a collectors item you are mistaken. Especially when anybody can create another collectors item by creating another coin. 

>All it’s gonna end up doing is facilitate the flow of money.

It if only facilitates the flow of fiat money the world will still be stuck with fiat money. 


>And if you think the government won’t show up to tax your ass based off of income from a decentralized currency then your just fuckin stupid.

Governments allowing their citizens to pay their taxes in crypto would be a huge succes for crypto.

If crypto offers something of value to society then governments should embrace it because it will be good for them.  

If crypto remains speculative, like gold, but where it's way more easy to sell something fake because you can really say that one crypto is real and another crypto is fake.

Then I full understand while governments are not happy with crypto if they are being used to rip of and defraud their citizens. 

So your way of thinking is part of the problem. The idea of using Bitcoin as currency is the reason why we have Bitcoin in the first place. Nobody got excited in 2009 about a way of ""facilitate the flow of money"". No, we got excited about a new form of money with possible better properties then current money. 

>A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online
payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a
financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main
benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending.
We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network.
The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of
hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing
the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of
events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As
long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to
attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The
network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort
basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest
proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.

It will lose node support fast as blockchain size increases along with the minimum bandwidth and processing requirements to run a full mode.
