"When talking about money period, those words have a specific meaning. If you're talking about putting more air into a balloon, then the same word is fair game. 

I've feel I spelled out pretty clearly why using those terms the way you're using them isn't functionally valid. If you don't want to address those points and offer a counter framing that makes some kind of functional sense, then I'm going to keep arguing that the only appropriate way to use those terms when talking about money, is in the context i'm using them.

There's an actual mechanic that causes prices to rise when a currency inflates, and there are thousands of other reasons that could also cause prices to rise that have nothing to do with inflation. The way you're using the term removes any kind of technical discussion about how currency supply works and how the prices of goods and services vary based on monetary policy.

>Imagine if you bought a car from a dealer after doing an astonishing amount of research only to discover that the dealership concealed a huge flaw in it and the engine seized up a month later and there was no regulation saying that the dealer was liable to pay for the fraud they just pulled on you 

Keep in mind, you're assuming my research wasn't enough, which is a pretty hefty leap in itself. Without regulation, there will be a lot heavier scrutiny on organizations like these. Private ""regulators"" would appear that don't have the power to shut down everyone that doesn't kiss their boots, but could give a very meaningful seal of approval.

But even if I didn't fully trust it and scams were a real danger, I could get some sort of scam insurance. Point being your doom and gloom scenario is unrealistic, because so many things would exist to replace regulations that would be better for everybody.

>scam businesses know that and bomb their Google and Yelp with fake reviews?

And we know about that, and trust such reviews less as a result. Review organizations are subject to the same scrutiny because believe it or not, not everyone is completely stupid and helpless.

">No. An increase as small as that would definitely NOT have sacrificed decentralization.

Every single increase has a measurable affect on decentralization. That's a fundamental law of nature. How much affect is subjective and circumstantial.

BTC is focusing on distribution and decentralization at its core. The more people who have access, the better it is for all. It's a long term goal, one step at a time. 

BCH is focused on utility, and making it useful right now, while sacrificing the core principals which BTC was originally intended for - decentralization and incorruptibility. People don't like BCH because, 1. it fundamentally goes against the original concept, and 2. It's marketed like some titty show in the bad part of town.

 1. Doomsday preppers fork BCH just in case the liars keep lying, this time saying they will upgrade to 2mb blocks if SegWit is accepted as a compromise but reneging on the deal after it is made. 

 2. Even-minded folks assume good will and advocate for a reasonable compromise. Core faithful get their full wish, SegWit integration, big blockers get the meager 2mb I stead of the 8 they wanted. That's ok let's stick together.

 3. Core supporters support 2x and make it seem as if they will accept it over reneging.

 4. 2x obviously doesn't happen because the doomsday preppers were right. The agreement was reneged upon. Even minded folks (like me) realise the whole thing was a farce, they only pretended to agree to get their way, and don't care about reneging because they have absolute power over the Bitcoin Core code (ahem centralization cough)

 5. Smart people realize BTC has been compromised and BCH is the actual decentralized fork and move over.

I am not saying it will not be needed in the future, most  probably yes. I am saying I am in favour of getting Segwit adoption to 100%, batching, Schnorr, Merkle trees, Lightning and other possible improvements and when we reach a point where it cannot be optimised further then 2X. I get the point of a part of the community about increasing the block size. What I don't get is why they would have to block Segwit because none of the reasons they gave were true. Couldn't they support Segwit and once adoption is 100% ans we hit a hurdle then pusb for a block size increase? S2X would have never been necessarh in Deceber if Segwit had been implemented for a year and at +50% adoption, that was my point.

"There were two initiatives going on at the same time.

One was Bitcoin Cash, while the other was ""SegWit2x"". 

SegWit2x was a two-phased (*heh*) initiative. First ""segregated witness"" (segwit) was to be implemented. Then blocksize was to be doubled. Segwit was implemented, but the doubling of blocksize never happened. There was a lot of drama.

But the BCH-people considered segwit a poor solution. They therefore forked before segwit was implemented.";3;1;False;gudlek;dy3u74k;Sir this seat is reserved for people with disabilities...;8fdy3y;https://i.imgur.com/gynXbKh.jpg

"There's a lot of concern that their chosen path, on-chain scaling, will create heavy centralization pressure. When blocks got full, they decided to just make the blocks bigger, and some of the discussions I've seen over in /r/btc suggests that they're willing and even eager to just keep ramping up block size whenever it becomes an issue. This creates centralization pressure because it means more processing power to check that blocks are valid, more bandwidth to send and receive blocks, more storage space to store the entire blockchain, etc.

If your goal is to maximize decentralization to make Bitcoin difficult to control, this is a terrible idea. If your goal is to increase capacity as quickly as possible to handle adoption rates and you don't really care about that centralization pressure, it's a decent idea. Some downplay the centralization pressure this would lead to because of things like hardware costs, but I have *never, not even once* seen someone try to make that argument from the perspective of someone in an impoverished nation. Sure, an enthusiast in a nation with a high standard of living and wages will have little problem affording it, but non-enthusiasts won't spend the money, and huge chunks of the human population simply *can't*, no matter how much they may want to if cost of a node increases much.";32;3;False;AHemlockslie;dy3nhxx;Sir this seat is reserved for people with disabilities...;8fdy3y;https://i.imgur.com/gynXbKh.jpg

Very Wrong Ver has been constantly doing things to affirm his wrongness, and its reached a pitch where people will naturally react.

Please view this history, its important for context -- https://hackernoon.com/thats-not-bitcoin-that-s-bcash-f730f0d0a837

This doesn't happen overnight. 

People don't sit down and decide to post a very thorough and documented article on something unless the situation demands it.

And that is what Very Wrong Ver has prompted. 

His underhanded tactics, deception, mimicry, social engineering attacks -- all of these has pushed and prodded people so far, that they're willing to expend energy to correct it.

So no, it isn't a problem that BCH is being discussed -- the real problem is that Very Wrong Ver doesn't know when to stop, how to stop -- or even entertain the idea that his push for power is corrupting the very thing he says he ""loves"".

"My theory: This is a new FUD campaign (just hear me out)...     
     
The current FUD campaign (claiming ""BCH is the real Bitcoin"") is coming to an end. Even if the calls for a class action lawsuit against bitcoin.com's fraudulent nature don't pan out, the community has been vocal enough to put a huge damper on their efforts. But let's remember one very important thing about the ones we know as ""The Others(ub)"": Call them what you may, but they can take a beating 'til they're black & blue, and yet they have always lived to fight another day (albeit with a re-imagined ""face"", and a completely different fighting style). 
     
My hypothesis: This new campaign is an attempt to make the r/bitcoin community look petty, mean, and immature (and in effect, causing newbies to venture over to the Others(ub) to see what they're all about (a.k.a.- bad publicity is better than no publicity). 
     
This attempt is sneaky, and I've got to hand it to them: *Smart*! Not only will they have their own legions of shills to upvote these posts to the Front Page of r/bitcoin; there will also be a vast number of ""true"" r/bitcoin subscribers helping them along just to spite the Others(ub) (and ironically, their/our own face). Think about it: if you were a n00b, ignorant to the reasons behind the BTC vs BCH debacle, and you went over to the BTC side only to see the Front Page filled with these kinds of posts, you'd probably go over to the Others(ub) based *solely* on the childish & borderline-bullying nature of this shit!        
    
Why do **We** need to be wasting our time & effort with that *fucking obvious* shitcoin? **We** have Segwit, LN, and much more tech that's just around the corner! **We** have *the best of the best* developers working on the protocol. **We** have a 9+ year track record and a **$7.5-Billion** market cap! And most importantly, **We** don't have to worry about our project failing as a result of anything other than a failure of the the base technology.     
     
Let me remind all of those misguided r/bitcoin subscribers that are still upvoting this shit: We/You do not need to stoop to the level of insults & smearing. Bitcoin can stand *just fine* on its own two feet. Do you see any other ""coin"" out there that's trying to do the same thing that We are? And no, I'm not talking about no-fee&instant-confirmation payments (most existing payment methods already offer this) and I'm not talking about BigGains&Lambos (which are definitely **NOT** mentioned in Satoshi's Visionary Paper of Whitefulness).    
    
If you understand the technology and its ramifications, then there is no need to spend another minute thinking about the Others(ub). They can have 80% market share for all I care; it will never change the fact that their ""technology"" is at best a cheap knock-off, and at worst a fraud.

"It's a bit more complicated than that.

Roger's claim is essentially that Bitcoin Cash is a more authentic realization of the original Bitcoin white paper. That isn't a transaction that can be confirmed or rejected. There is no governing body with the authority to overrule it. The miners have some control over what is allowed to happen on the chain that they're mining, but they can't somehow make it an objective fact that their chain is the one and only ""real"" Bitcoin blockchain.

None of that matters at the end of the day. What matters is that the Bitcoin Core blockchain is much more *popular* than the Bitcoin Cash blockchain, therefore all of the exchanges call it Bitcoin and give it the BTC ticker. No amount of hash power could've prevented them from treating Bitcoin Cash as a straightforward upgrade if they had wanted to do so. Sticking with Bitcoin Core was a business decision informed by popular demand, not the result of some formal democratic process.

Roger may be wrong in some sense, but he isn't wrong on *facts*--because there simply are no facts about the ""realness"" of any given Bitcoin fork.

I've seen this argument, and Richard Heart destroys this as an argument from authority. Satoshi and the original core devs stepped away from Bitcoin because they didn't want to become the thing they wanted to stop. They wanted the entire Bitcoin community to vote with their CPU (EVEN SAYS THAT IN THE ORIGINAL PAPER, VER!!!) and not their power... But as Heart describes, you're going to create two communities, and both are going to fight for control with power and influence, with both saying they're the real bitcoin... Honestly, people just have to be smart about this. The whole reason we needed crypto in the first place is we can't trust humans in power, we have to trust a system, I feel that's why Satoshi wanted to stay anonymous and why he's disappeared. He wanted people to focus on Bitcoin and not the name. But that's ironically exactly what we've done, even naming a unit of Bitcoin after him...

I despair at comments made by those that toss an insult in the first line in an attempt to establish themselves as an expert. The decentralization of bitcoin is something that seems to be greatly in doubt. There are other coins far more decentralized. Never the less, while there are plenty of experts in bitcoin there seem to be few with 1. Solid understanding of how markets work 2. Solid understanding of economics, Bitcoin, requires people to actually buy in at ever increasing risk of continued growth based only on speculative value. At the same time bitcoin promises to become the primary currency of the world which would require price stability, which is the last thing speculators desire. If I am a large speculator...my risk becomes substantial, and the volatility perhaps too much, unless I can hedge to the downside, as more money goes into that kind of hedging big money manipulation enters the market....its one thing to speculate, but quite another if poor souls drop their last 20k into the market on hope.

Stop trying to rewrite history. Antpool was blocking segwit, [they said so themselves.](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/antpool-will-not-run-segwit-without-block-size-increase-hard-fork-1464028753/)

""When asked specifically whether Antpool would run SegWit code without a hard fork increase in the block size also included in a release of Bitcoin Core, Wu responded: “No. It is acceptable that the hard fork code is not activated, but it needs to be included in a ‘release’ of Bitcoin Core. I have made it clear about the definition of ‘release,’ which is not ‘public.’”""

i.e. They will block segwit until a hard fork version of Bitcoin Core is released. (That's what they said until the UASF movement sent them packing)

He did it for dishonest purposes.

Speak for yourself. I'm a Bitcoin user and I wasn't fooled by this scam fork. I never ran that scam node software. Same with >99% of us. Your scam really never caught on.

All that users needed to do and did was to run the real segwit client, which is Bitcoin Core, and let the miners activate segwit when they may. UASF looks more like an attempt to allure miners to disable or delay segwit, which failed, partly because not enough users like you were dumb enough to put their bitcoins up for grabs. You guys tried to insult miners, promise things to them and then betray them, allure miners with free bitcoins through a UASF fork and attacks, and all this failed to divert them from their course of activating the real segwit when they promised.

> Miners quickly fell into line without a fight, because that's how bitcoin works on a technical level.

HAHAHA tell me how bitcoin works on a technical level, let's hear the idiotic misconceptions. According to you, consensus rules changes can be dictated by some random central idol figure and his few worshippers and then everyone else has no choice but to follow them. You speak of decentralization and then promote ideas of central planning for bitcoin, which don't work anyway, on a *technical level*. Hypocrite.

Right, and forking bitcoin into a shitcoin, as you attempted with UASF, is not part of this. *We* (apparently not you, that's why you said ""they"") want real segwit on the real bitcoin, not on some worthless forsaken shitcoin. You were forced not to fork off through UASF only because miners activated the real segwit on their own and your UASF shitcoin was ill conceived. Let that not hold you ""hostage"" to the bitcoin miners that you so hate.

"> We can both accept that what he did here is good, and that what he did before with S2X was really, really bad.

I wonder. He is calling out Ver for failing to to topple Bitcoin with a looney fork he co-opted once S2X failed. He is not calling Ver out over the technical inanity that is the BCH roadmap, inanity that S2X was no stranger to.

Let us not be mistaken, BCH is garbage on its own lack of technical merit, regardless of how obnoxious Ver is. This fork isn't even at the point where implementation snafus would matter, because it would crash and burn on a perfect implementation anyways, seeing how terrible the ideas being implemented are to begin with.

Voorhees is critical of the tip of the iceberg. It's hypocritical, as he attacks the politics, yet conveniently ignores the inane technicals, even more so in a space where code trumps politics at every turn. I would even say he goes as far as saying BCH is sound, as he implies it would be Bitcoin if it had the most accumulated work.

"> the users decided Bitcoin is the software code hosted at the **bitcon core repository** right now

This is true.

> what the miners decide to mine is irrelevant and that was demonstrated with UASF.

This is contradicted by what you just stated above. UASF was a different repository with different consensus rules from Bitcoin Core (the rules about activation of new consensus rules are themselves consensus rules). UASF constructs and demonstrates exactly an *exception* to the rule that miners don't decide on their own. Normally, users first adopt a soft fork (like BIP141 in Bitcoin Core) and then miners signal for it and activate it. Both users and miners decide. It goes through only if both users and miners agree. This is good. This is how it should be. A UASF does not do what it is claimed to do. Miners practically get full control over what happens to those naive enough to run UASF software, right down to the ability to appropriate the bitcoins which UASF users transfer, in the cases of new transaction output formats such as with SegWit. That's right, the security of bitcoins sent in new ways through a new soft fork absolutely depends on and assumes that the majority of miners *agree* to such new soft fork rules, otherwise the bitcoins can be transferred somewhere else.

This is so, because if a change to the consensus rules is not properly *agreed to*, the old rules are the legitimate ones (in this case, Bitcoin Core rules). This principle holds in law and other fields. It is a really simple social principle.

Users using UASF in effect give up full control to the miners, even if they delude each other that they do exactly the opposite.

Perhaps you meant to say that a good demonstration of the fact that miners are not in full control over the whole system is the failure of the 2x hard fork (which was never adopted by users).";1;1;False;fts42;dy3rjf8;Erik Voorhees: “Roger - please stop referencing me to back up your opinion that Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin.

"Erik,

I don't think at all that you are an enemy of bitcoin. In fact, I think you are a great supporter of it. But it's difficult to really understand what bitcoin really is. 

Think about it this way. Let's say that in the future about 51% of miners decide that they don't like the fact that the block reward will be decreasing and they want to keep it at 12.5 btc. So, they get together and agree they will maintain the block reward at 12.5 btc no matter what. So there is a chain split---in the immediate period their chain will have 51% hash power (thus greater total POW) and the other 49%. 

Now you are saying that the market will decided because based on which chain users prefer the price of one chain will drop and the price of the other will rise and therefore miners in the 51% group will switch to the 'true' chain. But let's say that they don't because of ideological reasons--we saw how during the BCH fork initially there were miners mining it at a loss just for ideological reasons so this can happen.

Which is the real bitcoin now? By your definition it is the one with the highest 'work'--the 51% chain with the perpetual 12.5 btc reward. But that's not right. Why? Because the miners changed the consensus rules of bitcoin unilaterally and even though they have the highest POW chain they have created an 'invalid' chain. I think Satoshi himself pointed out such a scenario.

I think Roger is confused. He created a new coin FROM BITCOIN--but it is NOT bitcoin. I think he would do himself a great favor by just realizing this and working to make his new coin 'better' than bitcoin instead of wasting a lot of energy trying to confuse people by claiming it is the 'real' bitcoin.

">Bitcoin is the chain originating from the genesis block with the highest accumulated proof of work.

**Nope!**

Each block in the chain must also conform to the consensus rules that were enforced when forming the previous block.

Although Voorhees has moved in the right direction, this seems like just another attempt to leave the door open to later redefine Bitcoin.  Under Voorhees’s asserted definition, all that Bcash lacked to be Bitcoin is more hash power.  The result is absurd.  In Voorhees’s world, one moment Bitcoin could be Bitcoin, then the next (with a shift in hash power) BCash could be Bitcoin, then with a shift back, Bitcoin is Bitcoin again.  Then this could be applied to Bitcoin Gold, Diamond, etc. such that at any moment, any number of forked alts could be the ever-changing “real” Bitcoin.
