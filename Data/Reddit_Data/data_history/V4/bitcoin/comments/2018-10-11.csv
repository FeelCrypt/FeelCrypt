"What has any of your post got to do with wealth inequality??

Bailouts happened because government decided the impact on society of letting so many banks go under would be bad for everyone. How we got into that situation in the first place was due to dodgy ratings systems that gave AAA ratings to assets that were extremely risky and should not have been relied upon. Yes the system was full of incentives to sell credit to everyone and anyone but the ratings put on bonds was the way to ensure that bad loans were not profitable for banks and credit agencies to sell to people. That is really where the system failed the ratings agencies were not truly independent and trust worthy.

During the crash I didn’t lose a cent. No one I know really lost any money at all. Other than super accounts/401Ks though again that was across the board so not sure what it has to do with inequality? It was actually those people holding bonds (the rich) who lost out. So yeah really no idea what point you’re trying to make here.";1;1;False;wballz;e7kx24u;Hmm...;9mtjva;https://i.redd.it/ncktmkc5g8r11.png
"The reason I say taxes algorithm on a centralised currency chain wouldn’t work is because taxes involve items that are not just the input and output of money. For example the number of dependents (kids) you have may impact your taxes and the benefits you get from the government, or your healthcare bill/mandate. The blockchain cannot easily determine if the petrol you just purchased was a work expense for that big meeting you have in LA. Or if was just you filling up the tank for a trip to the beach. Taxes are insanely complicated and a simple algorithm looking at transactions only would not work.

Mate everyone right now has the ability to create value if they so choose. You can create art and sell it, farm produce and sell that, mow lawns and get paid, or as most of us do get a job and trade your labour for money. If you wanted to make money from the electricity grid you could do that by getting craploads of solar panels and selling the electricity back onto the grid. Right now people have numerous ways to create wealth, not every millionaire out there was born a millionaire. Much to this subreddits belief the man isn’t keeping you down and the USD isn’t keeping you down, it’s all on you.

"okay, so it looks like we agree that any block chain that would eventually be implemented would have to be *centralized.


 we disagree on what can be programmed into the chain (and that's cool believe me, accountants need jobs too), but I totally think that you could program automatic taxable transactions just from like a programming perspective it's possible, getting governments and people to trust it? who knows.


when I was talking about decentralized aspects I was referring to scalability, kind of like a hermit in the woods, he has access to resources maybe not money though, but if he wanted he could see what I mean?


Like I said earlier, I think that everyone should have the ability to create value if they so choose rather than just being a conduit, that Is why (while the government would control market saturation through production/nonproduction) the average joe would be able to create kwh$ proportionate to his ability, thus (in a very similar way to current the economic model) value is tied to both the government and the free market, all the while creating an incentive for renewable infinite energy to replace fossil fuels using the profit motive.

"You’ve proved time and time again you don’t I understand the basics of economics. Yes inflation can be a bad thing when out of control, but the best way for an economy to run is with a small amount of inflation. That’s how it works mate.


As for the rest of your post I am not even going to bother because you can’t even format it to a readable version it’s just one long rambling paragraph and I am not going to bother when it’s clear you have no idea about economics and think taxes could be just enforced at a transaction level on the chain. You seriously don’t have any idea about the complexities of the system you are trying to replace. As I said before it’s as if you are trying to replace the entire education system with a single dictionary. You don’t have a clue.

>	 so when you keep talking about inflation like it is this big hole in my idea when I covered how multiple forms of inflation would play out in a kilowatt hour dollar... so many people would use something like a solar panel as an investment, and anything they get back (kilowatt hours/ dollars/ etc.) would be ROI exactly like in today's economy,

Do you even read the crap you write? Lol ‘would be ROI like in today’s economy’ Jesus man that has gotta be the funniest statement I’ve heard. It’s like saying I’d buy goods via a transaction like in today’s economy!

"Sure thing buddy. If the entire tax code could be replaced by an algorithm it would’ve been done already mate. Our banks would be running the algorithm and taxes would be handled automatically. Blockchain doesn’t introduce anything that would make automating taxes easy, you are living in a dream land. You are one of these idiots who thinks blockchain is somehow gonna make us into gods who can fly and live forever. You are so deluded it’s not funny.

Dude you obviously don’t understand how inflation and deflation works and why we need government and monetary policy to manage the inflation. You can’t have a decentralised system where there is no control or management by a central authority. Otherwise you would be pushed around by the whales as all you crypto guys already are.";1;1;False;wballz;e7k0497;Hmm...;9mtjva;https://i.redd.it/ncktmkc5g8r11.png
"Hahaha ok so you have obviously not read all of my posts in this thread because I’ve actually said specifically that it is decentralised currency that cannot work. If you put a centralised currency on a blockchain I wouldn’t really have a problem with it but the chain would need to be centralised and controlled by the government.

Yes in many instances taxes are easy to calculate for example the sales tax you pay on the ice cream at the shop. And even here in Australia we are getting to the point where a person working one job and doesn’t plan to make deductions will soon be able to avoid lodging a tax return but for people with investments, multiple income streams, dependents, expenses etc. You need a full tax return for the end of the financial year to summarise everything you’ve done that year.

As I said before adding a taxing algorithm to a blockchain that manages all payments in the world would not work for all the items I’ve listed above.

As for why decentralised won’t work I have explained this multiple times. There needs to be a central authority which manages the economy which makes sure that inflation is kept under control. Which makes sure that every citizen is paying their taxes. Which makes sure that people are not laundering illegal money or sending huge sums of money around for illegal purposes. You need a way to actually fund the government and everything they do without reducing the dollars that every one of your citizens is earning. You need to manage interest rates to a point to ensure that people do not go broke by having a home loan but then again debt can’t be too cheap to the point where the housing market booms out of control.

As I say you need to understand monetary policy and all the systems, regulations and processes in place that make our economy actually function. Moving to a decentralised currency would break most of these systems and would not allow for adequate replacements. Basically there is almost zero upside to a decentralised currency and countless downsides.

So you have faith that wealth will move around freely with bitcoin but not with fiat? When in reality in a fiat economy with inflation people are encouraged to spend their money or invest their money whereas in a deflationary economy like bitcoin people are encouraged to hold their currency and not spend it. As you see now the big holders then manipulate the market and the price and whales bully you while they make more money. Facts are facts, distribution of wealth on bitcoin is many many times worse than fiat and there is no explanation for why that wouldn’t get worse rather than better especially when there will only be 21m of them.

"okay so I said I was done but you actually came back with a point that can actually be discussed go you! a lot of taxes are already on algorithms amazon, walmart, your mom's strange, lots of places (accountants just write it down and fill out forms which block chain does automatically so taxes *could be just as easy)! so incorporating it into a *centralized (said that it would be centralized the entire time... but you don't know how to read)  crypto would be easy and way more possible than you are giving it credit for...

while we're on the subject, I don't even like Bitcoin, I'm here to remain informed... 

and again, in a *centralized crypto/ kilowatt hour currency not only would such policies be possible but they would be more effective and efficient because of better accounting in cyber currency. which leads me to the point of you really don't even understand the idea and because of your closed minded ignorance have only the capacity to create strawmen of my idea.

decentralized currency and *centralized currency are completely different, and you don't know how to read, I said crypto was optional and that paper could still represent the currency but the currency would be based on kilowatt hours... the system would just function better if it was automated.

I really think that you think that this conversation is about crypto currency so the little ~~dick up your butt~~ voice in your head won't let you listen... so you just parrot the arguments against crypto not realizing that (resource based economy) =/= (crypto currency)

"see you keep proving my point... you don't have an argument, you only have insults and a command to Google something, how about you Google why inflation is a bad thing? because inflation is a coin and it has two sides... so when you keep talking about inflation like it is this big hole in my idea when I covered how multiple forms of inflation would play out in a kilowatt hour dollar... so many people would use something like a solar panel as an investment, and anything they get back (kilowatt hours/ dollars/ etc.) would be ROI exactly like in today's economy, and like I covered before the idea is similar to farming in that value is created in the form of electricity and is ""sold"" (converted into kilo watt hour dollars) in the same way that food is (kinda) the electricity can then be spent or saved, like money except that once electricity is spent it is gone, so the need for a constant power supply is created, necessitating the very same money creation you credit inflation with... except on a daily scale and it literally makes it impossible to hold on to money forcing reinvestment, not just creating an incentive... let me ask you a question, if I gave you 1 billion dollars, do you really think you'd be able to spend it all in one life time? if your answer isn't no, you're lying... If your only point is inflation I'd like to point out that I pointed out how a governing body would be able to create the very same inflation that you are obviously so obsessed with, using an economic switch much like the oil reserve we currently have... but I bet you haven't addressed it because you have no answer to it... so you just call me a teenager and talk about wages... well you say wages are on the rise and I say they're stagnant, particularly when you account for that inflation that you are so fond off, it honestly makes  me sick when people don't address actual points in an argument and go straight to insults... But Now in fairness I must address the whole point to countries that have unstable currencies thing, well okay, so when I was talking about the roman empire I could have talked about any number of nations, the holy roman empire, Britain, china (pre opium), etc... and how they all fell victim to currency manipulation and well as inflation... hell I can even take your examples as well, because they have fell victim to the exact same thing currency manipulation at the hands of a banker or another country (cough the us cough cough cough) now I will admit, this curency is not without the ability to be manipulated and inflated, but because there is a tangible resource that is backing the economy it doesn't matter if the currency is being manipulated because the resource can be pulled out of the economy and created independently of the economy, (but then how would you prevent things like the black market and tax evasion? well that's the beauty of using electricity over say... oil for instance, electricity is harder to transport cost effectively without using infrastructure... so on a small scale the black market will not go away, but on a large scale, it would be almost impossible [given that cyber versions of the currency are used] ) now to your ""point"" about Hitler, when comparing things it is important to compare apples to apples and tomatoes to tomatoes and oranges to oranges, now when you said you could replace Rome with Zimbabwe or Venezuela, I cringed a little, see Rome is a apple (economic power House that spanned about a fourth or fifth of the world's surface) and Zimbabwe is a tomato, and Venezuela is also a tomato, (small country of little significance to the world economy) America on the other hand is an apple, see when the apple is big enough you can cut off slices but, the apple eventually gets to a point where it cannot be cut anymore, we call this systemic stagflation, and every time that it has occurred  it was caused by internal economic failures like the failure to control inflation for example, or corruption causing a failure to recoup taxes, causing larger than ""acceptable"" deficits and a lack of austerity measures because that would hinder the economy... which is bull shit... because well a healthy economy breathes, but a constantly inflating economy just exhales until it's last dying breath... Small economies are more like tomatoes if you keep slicing you get ketchup meaning a change in leadership with promises of sugar to sweeten the blow. I think the American empire is on its last leg because we shot the other one by starting shit, like you know a trade war with our biggest trade partner and tearing up a peace deal and getting called a rouge state by the UN that your country helped create in its prime all the while idiots are screaming about a dude who got drunk and allegedly did a bad thing over fifty years ago, and all the while underemployment is up, unemployment is down and the stock market is hitting record highs (from stock buyback mostly) the fed officially spent it's silver bullet letting the interest rate loose trump lowered taxes on people who have more money than any one dude with a solar panel could ever hope to create. Did I mention the minimum wage is still 7.25 an hour? which has *not* kept up with your inflation. Not to mention the fact that Americans are in more debt today than any other society in history... because... debt is good? wether it's the national debt or the personal debt, it's on the rise and for some reason, people think that it's a good thing, but what happens when the inevitable austerity measures have to be put in place? and the banks steal all those houses, cars, iphones, boats, and Americans are hit with another depression? the phrase too big to fail is bull shit... I'd like to turn the page to Brittain and it's ww2 debt, during ww2 GB incurred some serious debt, and in exchange for the United States continued aid the empire had to fall into it's current role as well not an empire. The same thing (probably worse) is coming for Americans because the UK had the balls to hand over the reins where the US much like Rome is way more likely to go down with the ship than to take handouts from other nations... especially ""communist"" China who is definitely going to overtake the us as a world power... which in my opinion is sad because I think America truly deserves at least 300 more years of being on top, but it would take some serious changes to make such longevity feasible... one such idea is a resource based economy the other ideas should be, reinvest in manufacturing, education, crops, tech, renewables, implement new tax policies with austerity on the rich and leanincy on the poor/middle class, removal of monopolies and oligopolies, and legalization of pot, universal pardon on weed, decriminalization of drug use and rehab instead of prison yah know basic end to prohibition, ubi instead of welfare, 15 dollar minimum wage and free college, a public works program similar to a new deal and sort of optionally QUIT FUCKING SPYING ON YOUR OWN CITIZENS but sadly the last one isn't necessary for the plan to work... on another note, why doesn't the United States make education federal? when it's ran by the state it's just worse and credits don't transfer across state lines...";1;1;False;isflerganaword;e7jyh5g;Hmm...;9mtjva;https://i.redd.it/ncktmkc5g8r11.png

"""even I can tear them down"" did you though?


a dog is a dependent, say a man has a wife and when he files taxes he claims his wife as a dependent, his wife has a job though so she's an asset right? wrong she's still a dependent. dependents can make money and still be a dependent.


wealth creation is the creation of a new primary production asset there is a nice clean definition for you. 


so even if you classify a dog as an asset it is still not a primary production asset. how is it not? well the dog must be fed to reproduce so something must go into the new dogs production.


but... but... fertilizer... water... all this supplamental to a plants growth... the plant would still exist without purchased water/fertilizer, just as the gold would still exist without the pick axe, we use these as supplements to extract value. Let's apply it to the sun, the sunlight would still exist without the solar panel, but the solar panel supplements the collection. could you honestly say the dog could exist without food? sure in the wild dogs hunt, but what happens if there is nothing to hunt? dog dies. but... but... what happens if there is no rain? plants die so what then? um seeds... and seed migration, plants can wait on the rain.


so the government would pay for things using taxes, and wealth creation in the form of electrical production... I thought that would be obvious. but you think dogs are assets so I guess I have to spell out everything.


Yeah but you do have the dollar as the world reserve currency, which is hilarious your money gets its value off of my money!


so let's be real, for a second, China and Russia are both buying up a shit ton of gold and are selling their us treasury bonds... G, I wonder why.

maybe it's because a RBE is more stable than fiat and they are about to make a currency play, or maybe it's nothing and the dollar will be the currency foreeeeeever!


when you shut down the ability to create hypotheticals and alternative theories you limit discourse, not unlike the christians you just compared me too, you limit the discussion with preconceved notions about economy with no ability to suspend belief, it's all very closed minded, and you seem to be projecting, see I have no doubt that the current system works, whether or not I think it works well is neither here no there. if a system is presented as the only way to do things it is dogma, and if I cannot question the system it becomes religion... so yeah, I'm the closed minded one.";1;1;False;isflerganaword;e7l0iyk;Hmm...;9mtjva;https://i.redd.it/ncktmkc5g8r11.png

"1. the currency would only be centralized, not the resources backing it, so these resources could be pulled out in the case of governmental failure. nice try.

2. we would still be on the gold standard today if it weren't for Nixon and it would be fine, the reason we transferred to this model was to buy influence in the middle east in the fight against Communism (which was also stupid)

3. profit =/= wealth creation, this can only occur when new wealth enters a system, dependent =/= wealth therefore new dependent =/= new wealth, see you classify a dog as an asset it's really a dependent, one that can be sold, but a dependent none the less (kind of like slaves back in the day FWI). see if you really understood the concept you'd be asking about what mining does to this system, and the answer is technically wealth creation, manufacturing on the other hand is technically wealth transfer, as is recycling, but you're just talking about dogs... like an idiot... 

I guess the last thing I'm going to tell you is that fiat currencies are historically proven to collapse humans have a tendency to be selfish and fiat currency ramps up the ability to create money from nothing the very problem you accuse my system of having. when in reality it's not money from nothing it's money from the sun, and other rbe's are money from the earth.

"On a few points before I finally stop this craziness.

1 - your only argument against the current system and bonds etc is government collapse. As we’ve already established the only currency that works is a centralised one controlled by the government so if you only problem with the current system is government collapse, sorry to break it to you but that is a risk with any system.

2 - we got off the gold standard as it’s not sustainable, you are talking about moving to a system that we previously had and have now moved away from because we found a better way.

3 - just because the sun is free energy doesn’t mean farming creates wealth and dog breeding doesn’t. Breeder creates dog, sells it for $500. Transaction complete $500 profit minus costs to create the dog. Dog dies tomorrow, well there was $500 made and the dog didn’t cost nearly that much in food. It’s not a transfer of wealth, I am giving them an asset that I just created and they are giving me money. You know animals also need sunlight to survive? While plants also need water, fertiliser and maintenance to survive. And when you sell the produce or Apple tree or whatever it is you farm again you are not creating new currency you are receiving money for your goods from someone who earned that money elsewhere. Anyway you may not have made up the concept but in this context it’s not just garbage but it’s totally irrelevant and has no bearing on currency being used. As whatever the currency is it’s issuing needs to be regulated by the government you can’t have people just creating new money from nothing. We’ve already established that.

And that’s where I’m gonna leave it. Most of your post (as with previous posts) is incoherent, irrelevant drivel that doesn’t actually address any real process that could completely replace what we have now effectively. 

I guess the last thing I’ll leave you with is to tell you to go and google why we have moved away from gold backed currency and why we now have bonds and gov can print money. As listed in my previous post how does the gov finance a $10B rail project and then $50B for obamacare and then $xB for this and $yB for that. A resource based system is just not sustainable in today’s world it would only hold us back.

"how do you not see that creating a new dependent is wealth transfer? so breeding dogs is wealth transfer... let me explain, sure you are getting a new dog but the dog itself requires more resources in than it could ever hope to put out... You really don't understand the concept, and I'm not the one who created it... 

okay so the printing bonds is the problem... when the US was on the gold standard (Nixon changed it fuck Nixon btw) the us if they wanted to build something they would have to have enough gold to back the project, just like my model... so your point is that because we as a society got so dumbed down that we accept fresh off the press paper a currency that we couldn't replace it with something more substantial? I hope you realize how retarded that makes you sound.

that's like ""If it ain't broke don't fix it"" meets ""unsafe at any speed"" and instead of saying ""hey you're right we could just change one thing about these cars and it still be a car"" saying ""what would you have us do quit making cars? you must be an idiot!"" which is exactly how you're treating me and this argument... 

and the bond system is garbage, the value of a bond is not backed by anything other than the government's word and future taxes, all of which are insecure if say the government collapses but an economy based on resources would still be standing no matter what entity collapses.

it's like the three little piggies, this piggy built his house out of stocks and the wolf came along and blew up the stock market, this little piggy built his house on government issued bonds and the wolf came and the government collapsed this little piggy built his house on resources and the wolf huff and puffed and what do you know we still have gold!

so sure maybe kilowatts aren't the way to go (they are though I've done a lot of research on this) but a resource based economy *DEFINITELY* is wether it be gold, silver, copper, iron, oil, trees, kilowatts, food, cocaine, etc.

see this argument has many layers, and many different ways something like this could be implemented, one such way is with crypto currency, another is representative currency, another is cyber currency. 

taxes, ubi, and specific commodity examples are irrelevant to the argument and are subject to policy. I am specifically referring to the currency base, as are you, You think that a governmental promise is as good as gold, I'd rather have gold (kilowatt hours in my argument's case).

if the system is so much more complicated than I can grasp than how come you can? see this is the fundamental flaw in you federal reserve ass clowns you think that someone must know every single move and it's name to play chess effectively when realistically speaking, all they have to know is the rules on how the pieces move...

"Ok first up your wealth creation crap is just that pure crap. You didn’t address what I said about dog breeders. For example I have 2 dogs I bought for $500 each, now I can breed these dogs and create new dogs to sell for $500ea. I can keep doing this over and over creating new dogs to sell off. How is this different from a farmer who buys seeds, plants and maintains them and sells off his crop?

Regardless you have strayed so far off topic. And your entire post is a perfect example of what I said in the last post you are basically now trying to say yeah we would replicate every existing system in this new system except instead of the government printing notes they would produce kilowatt hours! Wow what an amazing revolution here this is going to fix everything! Forget the fact that right now for a government to fund a $10B railway project they can print money and issue government bonds... in your world they would need to generate enough energy to sell off for $10B worth of goods? Dude I could do this all day listing so many flaws with your concept though much like all these crypto fan boys your response is always oh yeah we’d just replace that with another system that works! Easy!

Dude the current system is so much more complicated than you can grasp and I’m just sick of constantly poking holes in your fantasy world. It’s a joke mate and I can’t believe after my initial post saying I wouldn’t waste my time educating you on inflation, taxes, monetary policy etc I’ve now wasted all this time on someone who refuses to accept the status quo is actually an amazing system and after I’ve pointed out numerous flaws with your concepts you fail to really point out a single problem with the existing system.

You describe banks as being issued the bonds by government and then being able to leverage up based on that. Bonds are assets and revenue streams purchased by banks (could be purchased by you if you can afford it) just like any asset. But you act like the concept of leverage is a bad thing, but without it your country would be in total shit. Businesses would not exist as people couldn’t get loans to start them up, people would not own their own houses as they would not be able to get loans to buy them. There is so much of society and the economy that relies on functioning banks in order for us all to prosper but you can only see the bad side and even then what you think is the bad side is actually the system working well.";1;1;False;wballz;e7kp6ke;Hmm...;9mtjva;https://i.redd.it/ncktmkc5g8r11.png
"oh fuck off, you were being reasonable and then you had to ruin it didn't you? like I have said multiple times, taxes could be completely left alone and this system would work yah dingo!

and I REALLY don't think you understand the difference between wealth creation and transfer... because you're coming off like an jack ass, so the wealth created by farming is mostly transferred quickly in a system and sure there is a roi rate on fert and seed and water, etc.. but seriously it's renewable... and energy comes from the sun... and is added to the system

no dog breeding is not wealth creation and I don't see what that has to do with anything except it shows that you don't understand the concept. all dog breeding does is increase demand in a system just like adding another human... therefore more wealth must be created to meet that demand...

desalination *is* wealth creation bud,  it's just one I hadn't included in the list. even though it is limited by input just like most wealth creation... new water enters the system...

this limited input is what would stabilize the market...

not to mention the fact that I already outlined how this type of currency could be regulated, you just choose to ignore it so you can call me a child and make sweeping remarks about everyone in this sub... you have no real criticism only whataboutism and strawmen, 

okay so regulation in this system would come from consumer demand, the government could influence this demand by increasing/decreasing federal production of kilowatt hours (like they already do with oil), people would not ""just be creating money willy nilly"" because it would eventually not be profitable to do so... like how it's not profitable for everyone to farm even though nothing is stopping you from farming. 

you keep talking about how I don't know how the economy works when it's clear you don't understand that this form of regulation already exists...


 so before you continue to call me a child you should really try to come up with a better argument than patronizing me... ";1;1;False;isflerganaword;e7kn392;Hmm...;9mtjva;https://i.redd.it/ncktmkc5g8r11.png
"Lolll now you just sound like a crazy conspiracy theorist screaming on the corner.

>	The system didn’t crash because of dodgy rating systems, although that was a factor. It crashed because YOU CANT KEEP PRINTING MONEY WITH NO CONSEQUENCES.

Printing money had zero to do with the crash. As I said it was all about banks buying up bonds that were not as stable as they thought they were. While at the same time smaller banks and credit unions were incentivised to sell loans to people who couldn’t afford them because the bond market ate them up as they would always get high ratings despite the risk. None of this has anything to do with printing money at all. In fact if the government printed more money and sold government bonds to the banks instead of the banks buying up credit bonds from retail banks the entire crisis may never happened. You couldn’t actually be more wrong about the cause.

Then you go deeper into the whole us vs them crap with out any facts or figures to back you up. What are your thoughts on people who worked at Bear Stearns, from the top to the bottom. What about all the elites who owned Bear Stearns shares? You think the piddly inflation related to bailouts impacted you more than the people who lost money on the stock market during the crash? You’re delusional if you the rich were unaffected by the crash.

Oh and I love it when you sit there talking about the top 1% seeing it coming, converting their money, buying up later etc etc... had a look at any stats about how many bankers & traders were out of work due to the crash? Yeah right they saw it coming and made money off it. There is the odd person who did (eg The Big Short) but they are in the tiny minority of the rich, most of them suffered way worse than you or I. You’re just spouting more of the usual anti bankers garbage on here with only conspiracy theories to back you up.";1;0;False;wballz;e7kyop7;Hmm...;9mtjva;https://i.redd.it/ncktmkc5g8r11.png
"You’re at least right in the sense that these days in America coming up from the bottom is harder than ever. But as I’ve said in the past that is not due to the currency, or banking system it is due to the politics of your country. If you all voted for universal healthcare and free college education (or a hecs system we have here) the debt burden on your citizens would drop dramatically and help to allow people to move up the classes. As I say it’s not at all got to do with the banking system.

Creation of wealth wow I don’t know who sold you that garbage but it is just that pure garbage. Farms create wealth huh? You do know that a farmer needs to buy land, seeds, water, fertiliser, pesticides, workers to sow the land, workers to harvest, then find people to on sell their goods too. Tell me how a farmer creates wealth but a dog breeder doesn’t? Or an artist doesn’t? Why is electricity production different from a company that bottles and sells water? Or a desalination plant? Your claims are insane I think you’ve been reading way too much reddit crypto forums. Regardless even if I somehow accepted your insane premise the entire reason you are trying to sell this idea is that you want a currency where people can produce their own coins/money by generating kilowatts or whatever. And as I’ve said a million times over you can’t have people just endlessly creating money without government regulating it, people creating money out of thin air would reduce the value of existing money at a crazy rate.

And then there’s your crap about taxes. That paragraph perfectly illustrates the problem with your entire argument. Instead of accepting that the existing systems work well and are designed in extremely complex way that has many moving parts to it. You just constantly try to claim (as others in these subs do) that step 1 is replace the currency and tracking system for it and then just work out bastardised hacked together solutions to replace highly complicated systems. We have this hugely complicated tax code and you’re like oh yeah we just change the whole thing to make it easier so it works with my currency idea. Ahhh yeah no mate. That’s not how things work, it’s like me saying you can’t get to China by driving a car you need to fly or take a boat and you’re like nah cars rule we just need to build a bridge there duh!! You guys try to suggest replacing the currency with another one that has a huge amount of flaws and will not effectively function as a currency and then when the associated problems are raised with other parts of the economy (loans, taxes, inflation, money laundering etc) the response is always ah we’ll just change it all so it works.

It’s like talking to a kid. You don’t just replace the professors at a university with monkeys and then say ah we’ll sort out all the other issues! But most important thing is we don’t have old white guys telling us about the future!

"okay so your first point is valid, (given current tax models) you are right we would have to drastically change the way we pay taxes for an algorithm like that to work, unless you just did rebates at the end of the year like tax returns kind of, but I think that something like ubi would work very well to offset an automatic algorithmic tax because most things that we take as exemptions would be covered by default so yeah.


And you have a fundamental misunderstanding of the creation of value argument, which I don't blame you it's not really taught, so in our economy there are only a few things that add new value into an economy, farms, (mainly renewable) electricity production, fossil fuels (kiiiind of but not really), and very few other things... the other part of the economy that you are most familiar with is wealth transfer, this is your job, your house, your car, resource mining (this is were fossil fuels are imo but that's neither here nor there), software, banking, it's all wealth transfer.

the main difference between the two is that wealth creation is where new money enters a system, and wealth transfer is when wealth circulates in a system.

plus unless you're from America I don't think you really understand just how hopeless things are for some people... but I'm not talking about how much I hate the us economy, I'm talking about a modern vision for the economy, and the benefits over our current out dated system...

see in some place like Australia, you aren't dealing with stagnant wages like many cities are in the us, (the minimum wage hasn't changed in over 10 years here mate) and considering that college price has, as well as car prices, and the cost of living, you tell me if this economy is fair.
