"Hello, 
I see you’ve donated to MAPS which is great as they are researching psychedelics for therapeutic purposes and yet in the 32 years they’ve been operating no research into Hallucinogen Persistent Perception Disorder (HPPD) has ever been conducted.

The Neurosensory Neuroregenerative Research Foundation has created a team to address this disorder and if successful would salvage the lives of the afflicted and prevent anyone from ever having to endure the suffering that comes with HPPD.

Please consider helping us as there exists no federal funding for HPPD. Solving HPPD in a way will make psychedelics safe for everyone.

Thank you

"Depends on how you really think the market is reacting. When bitcoin hit it's ath there were people that bought at 19k, held on to probably 17k and decided it's going down a lot more and took the loss. Well they are now sitting pretty at 11k with a potential to rebuy the same amount of coins cheaper. Same with buying high, you can catch the wave for a little and get out with profits.

There is a chance everyone buying at 11k could think this is low, but in 2 months we could be sitting at 6k, and 11k was the high. It's really not that easy to determine the highs and lows - but all you can do is use good judgement on what news there is, how long the price has been sitting and the % swings.";7;1;False;tranceology3;dt8gryq;Keeping Coinbase on their toes - Robinhood adds no-fee crypto trading!;7sx64q;https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/25/free-cryptocurrency-trading-app/?ncid=mobilerecirc_recent

">That's not investing. It's speculating. Investment is when you spend money on the expectation of returns. Dividends, growth, whatever.

True.

>There are no dividends here and never will be.

Of course not. Its not a stock. 


>Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme. 

Never go full-retard. There is no ""one"" who owns bitcoin as a fund, and is promising growth or returns or dividends.  Ponzi has a very specific definition and by definition, a public, decentralized cryptocurrency can't be one. Even tulips in the 1630's were not a ponzi scheme. Commodities can't really be ponzi schemes (now, derivatives could be made into one).

>The only possible way that it might be worth its current astronomical prices would be if it had a chance to become a real currency, which the speculation-fueled bubble rules out categorically. 

There's a lot of truth to this; bitcoin is not (yet) a money.  But you kinda have causation backwards: there is market failure or coordination problems inherent to getting a non-monetary commodity or token bootstrapped into position as a money...for better or for worse, the lottery-like speculation on and volatility of bitcoin's exchange price, is a market mechanism for bootstrapping this token into more widespread holding, so that the token's good monetary properties (fungibility, scarcity, durability, divisibility) can be fully actualized.

The tech of course has also begun, over the last few years, to limit the token's progress towards moneyness, because of the difficulties in scaling transaction capacity, before it became too popular for its own good. This obviously has made it a poor currency, because of high fees and slow confirmations.

Don't forget that some countries, especially the U.S. have been taxing cryptos as a commodity or capital good. This makes it de facto illegal or at least completely impractical for most people to use the token as a currency; as the tracking and reporting requirements complexify everyday spending (and can't just be automated simply in wallet software either) to a point that the vast majority of people are certainly not going to deal with, just to start spending and supporting some new experimental currency like bitcoin.

These and many other persecutions by some governments, have greatly curbed the use of bitcoin as a money, and instead, left it in the realm of speculators and day traders; so transaction loops are not formed and the gradual decline in price volatility which we were seeing has thus likely been halted.

It's the difference in psychology between a trader and investor. There are pros and cons to each. Trading takes a lot of time. A LOT of time. It will consume your life if you let it. When your cash is sitting in a losing position, as a trader, there is an opportunity cost to every day it sits. Most traders seek to open and close positions in a matter of days. Day traders specifically look to be in and out of a position within a single day (definition of day trader, makes less sense with Crypto since the markets never close - much easier to measure when they are only open a few hours a day). Swing traders look to do overnight trades. Volatility is a trader's friend, so it's unsurprising we're seeing so many in the crypto space.;11;0;False;ex_nihilo;dt8fq0y;Keeping Coinbase on their toes - Robinhood adds no-fee crypto trading!;7sx64q;https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/25/free-cryptocurrency-trading-app/?ncid=mobilerecirc_recent

"No, the entire system itself is circular. The other poster is correct in his description of what money itself is. Money itself has no intrisic value, it's a stand-in for things of value it is exchanged for (i.e. goods and services). 

Money was created because bartering goods and services was inefficient and difficult to keep track of. How do you value someone's skilled labor for 2 hours against someone's unskilled labor of 4 hours? How do you pay someone to dig a well with wheat you grew when they didn't need the wheat themselves? How do you keep up with appropriate rates of exchange when one good is plentiful and another is more rare? You can do this in a ledger, but it quickly becomes cumbersome to keep up with and difficult to divide those valuable goods and services at a fair and predictable rate.

That's where money comes in and was created as a distributed ledger system for units of value. Now, this shiny piece of metal that is hard to find (making it hard to counterfeit, especially when minted into specific shapes), is somewhat easy to create set units of trade in (denominations) and is easy to distribute over a large trade area. There have been all sorts of currencies, both paper and coin but their purposes we're always the same. Even peppercorns were used for a period of time because of their value and ease of transaction, but that starts to muddle the line between currency and bartering for a good (similar issue with precious metals but different and I'll explain shortly).

Money/currencies thus became the medium of exchange (the middleman) for all goods and services and its form has been largely physical in one way or another, but not always, especially when banks and lenders are involved. That's where the previous use of ledgers still play a role, but now instead of keeping track of how many bales of hay or hours of digging you owe for the 5 quarts of milk you bought, they simply keep track of the popular currency amounts instead since it became the common way to judge value.

So now that you have a trustworthy unit of exchange that can be easily transfered from one person to another, now you can sell your goods and services to anyone (not just to those who had something you needed) and thus compete in a market against like goods and services. This is more efficient and cost effective for everyone. 

People confuse money with things having intrisic value. Money itself has no intrisic value, unlike good and services. Goods and services still have their value without money but money has no value without goods and services. It starts getting murky when you start using things like precious metals and such because those have been used as a unit of currency but themselves are a good which can be traded for other use besides as a means of transaction. As such, gold/silver/precious stones are really a commodity more than anything else. They can have both an intrisic value and be used as a means of exchange, though technically anything can be used as an exchange medium really.

Over time, we developed markets and financial systems that have so complicated everything, the average person no longer thinks of things having value except what it is tied to in a unit of currency. It's kind of ironic really. We created money to simplify the means of trade and ensure the value of goods and services were appropriately traded and ended up with a system with so many middlemen, that money became the object people perceive as value and not the end goods and services it was created to facilitate the transaction of. 

Where you seem to be getting hung up on is the concept of IOUs vs a promissory note (i.e. I promise to pay you money). A promissory note would be an IOU for a loan of currency, not for a direct good/service. What he's referring to as an IOU is what the medium of exchange is. Think of it as money being receipts that everyone transacts in. 

For example: I have a bale of hay but need some nails for my barn only the Blacksmith doesn't need hay and doesn't  want to have to deal with a bale of hay to exchange it for something he needs. Because a bale of hay is difficult to transport, I give a receipt for a bale of hay to the blacksmith. The blacksmith now possesses the IOU receipt of a bale of hay which they can trade to the butcher for a chicken and so on until someone trades for the IOU of a bale of hay that actually needs it and collects. As mentioned, this is inefficient and also easily subject to counterfeit. The goods exchanged throughout the transaction cycle we're the only things of intrinsic value, not the IOU receipt.

Now, if you were to start talking about promissory note and lending of currency, that gets into the rabbit hole a bit further but it's really nothing more than individuals or institutions that act as a trustworthy middle man to increase market liquidity by using their own surplus as a buffer. They themselves are providing a service and charge for that service in the form of interests. Honestly you could talk for quite awhile getting into the banking system as a whole but it all boils down to that really.

Public ledgers are really no different than the private ledgers that a bank might use internally. Most USD does not exist in physical form as the vast majority is really all electronic ledger entries in various private institutions. You also have to remember that because lenders can loan money to others that isn't theirs, they are essentially creating additional money in the system based on how much they leverage their account holdings (see fractional reserve banking). This is why regulated money markets and finance laws are important because a run on banks could be catastrophic to an economy, but that's a whole other conversation.

TL;DR - Money is a system (electronic, physical, ledgered, etc) of unitizing goods and services in a common rate of exchange so as to facilitate transactions with any party in that system. That unit of exchange is itself paid and accepted because of trust in the system of the stability in the unit of value. That trust can be government, private (banks) or a public ledger (crypto). Those units themselves have no value except for the goods and services they are built upon, hence IOUs.";2;0;False;xanatos451;dt6zpga;Steve Wozniak: Bitcoin is better than gold and USD;7sln7i;https://blog.unocoin.com/steve-wozniak-bitcoin-is-better-than-gold-and-usd-4fdbfcb6e5bb
"1) The government creates glorified IOU's called BONDS

2)These BONDS increase our national debt and put the public on the hook to pay it back...These IOU""s are swapped to create currency, the Treasury sell the Bonds to the banks, the banks sell our IOU's to the Federal Reserve Bank (which is another bank which they probably own, an not a part of the government) at a profit ...The federal reserve then opens it's checkbook which doesn't have a penny in it and buys those IOU's with IOU's it writes, check on a checking account that has a ZERO balance...then they give those checks to the banks and currency just springs into existence and the the who process repeats...this results in a build up of bonds at the federal reserve and currency at the treasury which is really just a supply of numbers...the treasury just deposits this supply of numbers in the various branches of government...

That doesn't matter. I don't care if you think it's valueless. I'm telling you I've already traded like 20k for USD this month. I'm not fucking over any system, I 100% support the system and the government. YES it's overhyped. I never said it wasn't. That's why it's so easy to sell. 

Lol shit I responded again. OK this is the last one for real. Dude you need to calm down. Why do you care so much if other people use crypto? Nobody is forcing you to. You have to learn to not get so upset over what other people do. 

Anyways, for real I'm done. You're not responding to what I'm saying. You're claiming I'm making statements I'm not.

"Remember Betamax? It was technically superior to VHS. But it was a terrible investment.

I note you're not OP, but calling me a shill isn't helpful. 

I wasn't saying LTC was a good investment. I wasn't saying ""buy LTC"" - I was saying it was technically superior to BTC and to say that LTC couldn't handle today's BTC transaction loads is factually incorrect.

Yet I'm not invested in LTC, I'm invested in BTC and one other alt-coin that I'm not going to mention by name because I don't want you to buy it.

Even though I believe LTC is better than BTC, I don't think it's a fantastic investment because in this crowded field, it's not got a rosy future, simply because it's not got the BTC brand - and there are better altcoins than LTC at doing the job LTC does (note: BCash is NOT one of them).

But BTC's current transaction limit is a f*cking disgrace, and introducing a few of the features LTC has proven would do a lot to improve its future prospects as a currency.

"The problem with what you've outlined is this:  The perceived value has the direct ability to affect a companies immediate purchasing power, thus further casting that business into a downward spiral.
If I spend McCoin to go buy a cheeseburger, and after that I write a blog post about how I hate McDonald's and am somehow a social influencer, there is the potential that lemmings holding McCoin decide to sell off on an exchange to purchase WendysCoin.  Since everyone pays McDonald's in McCoin, McDonald's now has to immediately react to this drop in demand and sell off McCoin to get MeatCoin and BunCoin so they can maintain the ability to buy from their suppliers before McCoin diminishes in value (be that temporary or permanent).  The sell-off of McCoin further sparks a volume-trading flag on the market, further dropping the value of McCoin, and when it comes time for them to cash in for RentCoin and PowerCoin, the apparent value of their coin no longer reflects the value that it had during the period in which they made the sales associated with the current accounts payable.  
So maybe every single day they should be hedging their McCoins right?  Buying a little PowerCoin and RentCoin and BunCoin everyday, and BikeCoin, and all sorts of other coins, put all that shit into all sorts of baskets because the market is completely unpredictable. That sounds like a completely fascinating world to live in doesn't it.  A real improvement on the current system.

If any other currency crypto, or Fiat exists in the world BTC will be compared to it. It would be an impossibility not to be. Fiat is not going to disappear. People still need to buy things with coin and paper in their hands, to deny this is simply to deny reality. The idea that its Fiat VS crypto is FALSE. Both will continue to exist. Further you seem to believe that Central Governments will not intervene in some way if they should decide. Centralized Power exists. It can block exchanges. This would not shut down a blockchain but it would cause failure of mass adoption of BTC or other coins. Governments ordering shutdowns of exchanges, use, corporate use, etc, are powerful tools.

Let's just look at stability. Gold last year started at around 1100~. 

Right now it's sitting at 1352, which is it's high over the last year. Cool to know. Generall it keeps around the 1.2-1.5k area. In the past five years it's low was just over 1000. So generally, for investing, it's relatively consistent.

Bitcoin started last year at around $935. Had a really good year, peaked at $19,343. In just over a month it dropped down to 10,965. It's lost more value in one month than gold has in 5 year. Companies are pulling out of accepting Bitcoin because of how unstable it is as a currency. On top of all of that, it's constantly under blast from government because it is a payment method used by criminals to purchase high quality, very potent and dangerous drugs in an almost completely untraceable form, and they are aware of that. They want to regulate it, they want it to devalue. 

I'm going with the currency that has a physical weight to it, bitcoins are imaginary money, they hold no physical value. A million different variables can instantly crush the bitcoin market, as we've seen in literally the last month alone. 

You can live in your fantasy world where you think it's the superior investment, and fuck it might have made you a great amount of money. And that's cool. But for real world long term investing, I'm going to go ahead and stick with the products that don't have the possibility of tanking 6k in a week.

"Depending on who you talk to it either *does* or *will* or *can* solve the fee problem.

The idea behind how it *can* solve the fee problem is two-fold, first, someone pays the fee on the blockchain to open/close a channel, and all transactions within that channel can be very inexpensive, like if the blockchain fee were $20 and you did 20 transactions, you would only need to charge $1 for each transaction.  That's just at current/outrageous fee rates...play with those numbers more and do 200 or 2000 transactions inside the channel and the fee can be miniscule.

The second way is that taking 200 or 2000 or 20000 transactions *per channel* off the blockchain and doing them within the lightning channels frees up the mempool right off the bat.  With a practically limitless number of channels able to be made, significantly fewer transactions to deal with on the blockchain itself, then blockchain fees go back to normal, or even lower than normal levels, so instead of $20 to open a channel, it could be $2 or $0.20 or whatever the market demands. Take 'that' number and start dividing by number of transactions handled on each channel, and you can start to see why other coins that wanted to be the coin that 'fixed' the problems with bitcoin were so anxious to get started before anyone ever saw an actual lightning transaction in the wild.  

Not saying it will be perfect, but if they make it as simple as it sounds to open/close a channel, and everything works smoothly, then there's really no need for another coin to be the 'cash' version...and the lightning network doesn't really introduce any other mining or coins to own or keep track of, etc.  

Also, in addition to transfer time and fees, it adds an anonymity feature not available with bitcoin itself...basically if it's half of what it promises, it's worth the risk the Core team took in holding their ground, Ver and Cash and all the FUD that came along the road in the meantime.";1;1;False;dnick;dt7genk;Steve Wozniak: Bitcoin is better than gold and USD;7sln7i;https://blog.unocoin.com/steve-wozniak-bitcoin-is-better-than-gold-and-usd-4fdbfcb6e5bb

"It’s a valid question you’ve posed. 

Think about it like this: Value in fiat currency enters the cryptocurrency market and that Is finite and real at the time of entry - speculative value or not, the money invested in cryptocurrencies is real. This value can theoretically always be flowing from one cryptocurrency to another, and their values will change to represent this flow. If someone moves $100 worth of BTC to ETH, the $100 is not multiplied by 2, it is literally exchanged. This is not an infinite supply of value, but instead high volatility in the market. New coins are gaining value from new fiat entering the market and from the exchange of other cryptocurrencies for the new entrant.

When cryptocurrencies and their underlying distributed ledger technologies mature, in theory the volatility should subside.";1;0;False;SleazySPI;dt731w9;Steve Wozniak: Bitcoin is better than gold and USD;7sln7i;https://blog.unocoin.com/steve-wozniak-bitcoin-is-better-than-gold-and-usd-4fdbfcb6e5bb

"You forgot drugs and child pornography... :/ 

Crimes are almost never solved by examining bank accounts, although arguably, the biggest crimes happen on bank accounts. Fact is, terrorists have no problem getting funded using USD and if you want money laundered, JPMorgan, UBS or Deutsche Bank are there for you. 

As for taxes; again if you have enough money, this isnt a problem with fiat. Large corporations and the uber rich get away easily with paying little to no taxes. its only the little guy that doesnt have access to the right financial instruments or overseas accounts, so he cant hide anything and pays taxes for the rich. Blockchains level the playing field.

But why would you even want to tax money? Thats almost as crazy as taxing labor. Tax consumption instead, and everyone will pay taxes, even thieves and drug dealers.

BTW, using smart contracts, you could make consumption/sale tax completely transparent and provable, without necessarily giving up any privacy. A shop could prove for every sales transaction that taxes where indeed collected, and those taxes can go directly and automatically to the government. Supply chains will increasingly be managed by blockchains, and could give governments selective insights, enough for instance to know no taxes where evaded  (and for food/drug safety and that sort of thing), without having to know what I bought when or where.
