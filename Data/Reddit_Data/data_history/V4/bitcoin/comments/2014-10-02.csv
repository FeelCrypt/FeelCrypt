"I responded to your snarky retort and addressed the use of cellular based ""wireless""   
     
>  so in your case you are talking about an even more powerful ""backhaul"" system, copper and/or fiber that is slightly further away.      
       
It has nothing to do with past/future until something changes that we can't even imagine yet. ""4G"" in the US or Africa still uses wires, big fat wires that you couldn't drop a ""meshnet"" in to replace them. Just because they are a 1/2 mile or so away rather that 100 feet away doesn't change what the OP said copper/fiber it is the same.

"I didn't know that cellular isn't wireless.

Deploying a meshnet does not need wires at all.  It could be done with many radios.  Radios are cheap now and have improving bandwidth and distance.  Bringing wires into a meshnet would be idiocy.

"cellular is a form of wireless between the device and the tower, the tower then has (sometimes several) wires called backhauls. They can be copper or fiber depending on the conditions. So yes, contrary to what people may think cellular networks are only generally wireless for the first portion of the journey that your packet takes through the internet.       
      
Cell based wireless can also use microwave or other other wavelength systems for backhaul in certain conditions (those still connect to wires then).  http://www.ciena.com/connect/blog/Cienas-1-Terabit-optical-transport-demo.html        
       
>   Deploying a meshnet does not need wires at all. It could be done with many radios.      
    
Yes, I know - I said you could not reasonably replace the backhaul for a cell tower with a meshnet (meshnet in current vernacular means wireless)";1;1;False;classicrando;ckyry42;Protestors are using using a P2P mesh network (Firechat) in Hong Kong to coordinate and not get shut down.

ugh, whatever dude - current technology cannot create a meshnet based internet with anywhere near viable in terms of reach or capacity - I am familiar with both, I ran the aodv routing code from the guy at the nist back when he came out with it in ~2000 - kernel modules, etc. That was before the current meshnet hysteria when they were called ad hoc wireless nets and it was mostly the government who was working on them.;1;1;False;classicrando;ckysaq2;Protestors are using using a P2P mesh network (Firechat) in Hong Kong to coordinate and not get shut down.

Firechat uses bluetooth right now, the bluetooth lib on android is worse than the one on iPhone (that is from a real developer who used them for real work). BLE is too new and mostly on iPhones currently all bluetooths old and new built in to phone are not built to support a number of connections as you would see on a denser mesh network. wifi chip and libs on devices have similar problems - they are not made to be APs, they are made to be clients.

The jamming wouldn't even have to be continuous but just enough to make people miss/lose some percentage of calls/emails/texts to make the network appear unreliable.
