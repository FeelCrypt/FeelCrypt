>__Chris Lamprecht__, aka MinorThreat (*mthreat* on [reddit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit)),  is regarded as the first person to be banned from the [Internet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet), in 1995.   After being sentenced to 70 months in prison for [money laundering](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering), Lamprecht was also given a punishment of no access to the Internet until 2003.

>Christopher Matthew Lamprecht had the [Federal Bureau of Prisons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Prisons) ID# 61153-080 and was released on March 3, 2000. 

>Under the order of Judge Sam Sparks of the [US District Court](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court) in 1995, Lamprecht was ordered to 70 months in the [Federal Correctional Institution, Bastrop](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Correctional_Institution,_Bastrop). Though a known computer [hacker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_(computer_security\)), the 24-year-old was never tried, nor pled guilty for [computer related crimes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_crime), making it the more unusual that he was not allowed to access the Internet. In 2002 Judge Sam Sparks released Lamprecht from his term of supervised release, effectively lifting his Internet ban as well.

"You create a certain number of keys for one address, and need a certain other number of them to spend bitcoins from that address.

For example, generate 4 keys. Set it so 2 keys are required. Store one on your phone, one on your home computer and one on your work computer. Give one to a friend, in case you lose some of yours.

You now need access to at least 2 of those devices, or one device and your friend, to spend your bitcoins.";1;0;False;immibis;cg78h6c;In the near future...;20r3a1;https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*A_V4-l0Loh6CFbHyM5Qg5A.jpeg

I think that bitcoin wallets apps should have a feature where two different passcodes will both unlock the wallet but one of the passcodes shows a decoy account with only a small percentage of your funds. Sending funds from the decoy account should trigger a silent alert as well. ;2;0;False;vizzlepuff;cg73tr3;In the near future...;20r3a1;https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*A_V4-l0Loh6CFbHyM5Qg5A.jpeg
