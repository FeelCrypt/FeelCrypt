No it most deffo isn't. Even if it was over now, it still wouldn't be a bubble. Zero is a lot less than 3 grand is it not.

I have fond memories of the days preceding this time last year. I work in an office full of tech-orientated people, at least half of the room were holding some quantity of Bitcoin. We had one of those little serving bells in the room, which someone would ring every time Bitcoin broke another $1000 dollar interval as the price climbed. I swear we must have rang the bell at least three times on on one particular day, all laughing as we dreamt of Lambos.;349;7;False;mhj360;ebwm7wv;Last Year & Today;a6o4sp;https://i.redd.it/vdeafl7obm421.jpg

"Are you guys all gambling? Is it price you're betting on? 

Is it not the historically right way to invest in the future VALUE of assets? 

Should we not be focusing on businesses that are showing good metrics? Companies that are doing the right things, and things that people do want and will be more valuable in the future? 

Let's say you buy an investment property, a 3BR house. And you're solely counting on selling it in 5 years for more than you bought it for, because you believe that that particular house is the kind of house people want, in an area people want to live. You think even more people Will want houses like yours in the coming years. Supply/demand says the price of your house goes up.

In the meantime, the market shifts downward, lowering the price of your house. Do you give a shit? No. Because you believe in the future value of your asset. You hadn't planned on selling this year. You said a few years from now. You make long term bets on expensive and risky investments. 

Price of your house goes down this year, you don't care. 

Long term bets. 

You don't gamble.

You evaluate assets and believe in their long term value. 

Sell when you feel you've profited enough that you value the cash more than the asset. When you'd rather have the money than future money it could produce.
