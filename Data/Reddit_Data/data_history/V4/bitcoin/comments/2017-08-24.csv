Yes true, but eventually it will repeat, the GPU miners then pool together again because they are incentivized to do so: the cost of mining a rejected and orphaned block is large, so you want as little latency as possible. Satoshi probably overlooked this. After all, his original release had the node and miner as part of the same software, so his intent was correct. ;1;0;False;buttonstraddle;dm2cn07;:/ That was an expensive coffee I just bought to show a demo transaction.;6vbfip;https://i.redd.it/6axrx39awahz.jpg
">the current market cap is due to investors (e.g. myself) believe that Bitcoin has more potential than only relatively cheap cross-border transactions.  

Agreed.

>relatively cheap cross-border transactions.  

You cannot downplay how immediately useful it is to have that ability. It gives bitcoin a real utility, right now. It gives bitcoin value.  

Other things like smart contracts, dapps, and all the cool stuff enabled by bitcoin are still in their infancy. The forex, settlement currency aspect of bitcoin is currently a major factor in its value. 

Bitcoin has much more potential that just ""relatively cheap cross-border transactions"", but those are currently something that makes bitcoin very attractive. Even better, its an aspect of bitcoin that doesnt undermine the basic concepts that make bitcoin different and give it its real value and revolutionary nature.

Better described as wiped maybe than formatting. It's a loose term anyway.
