"«*I'm aware that population birth rates moderate and even begin to decline in rich societies*»

You weren't aware: you claimed right above that population decrease was due to ""economic stagnation.""

«*have been unable to hold a steady, long-term job*»

Wrong. As I have already pointed out, Japan has a lower unemployment rate than the US. 

«*This is a situation where you have to look at more than just the numbers, although even the numbers would suggest that there is more at play here than a simple trend that all wealthy nations go through*»

This is a very vague statement that means nothing. Why is Japan's population decrease worse than the trend? Why do you want to look at more than population numbers to determine if the population is decreasing?

Look, I know that economists generally agree that deflation is unwanted. I recognize this. But 100 years ago economists were in widespread agreement on things that sound ludicrous today (eg. that having your currency 100% backed by gold was a great idea—it's not). So if economists have historically often been wrong, what makes you believe that economists of 2017 won't be proven wrong 100 years from now? The fact is, we don't understand economy that well. It's a constantly moving research topic. Knowledge is changing. It is possible (not plausible, but possible) that in the future we will change our stance about inflation/deflation. And maybe no inflation, or a very mild deflation will be seen as favorable.

All I am pointing out is that if you apply critical thinking and examine a particular economic turmoil that is usually attributed to have been caused by deflation, it is actually not very obvious that deflation was a *cause*, as opposed to a mere *symptom*. And this is pointed out by some economists—a minority, I will give that to you. Finally, as I pointed out with **facts** about Japan (low unemployment, high Gini index, etc), it's not even clear what the ""problems"" are in a country like Japan that is ""supposed"" to have problems caused by deflation. In our entire exchange you have failed to point a single source, a single fact, a single number that shows ""here deflation caused X in Japan"".

"> With deflation, you'll get continuous underinvestment.

not all investments are created equal. investing in a car factory is different from opening a mall which is different from buying securities and so on and on.

deflation hampers only the worst investments. so no damage to growth.

it is really not so hard to understand.

> Referencing the IDEA of a source, isn't referencing a source.

it was many years ago and i don't have it anymore.

> Wait, are you basing your arguments on some sort of tribal feeling?

Bitcoin will replace $ and it is deflationary. people will learn how deflation works and will enjoy it. no need for me to convince you or any other guy. bitcoin will do the trick for me. and when it does your theories will be nothing more than trash.

that's all. i'll win the argument just by waiting

"""subjective preferences""

every individual feels rich at his own point. but if i get richer by my savings gaining purchasing power at some point i'll feel rich. 

anyways while i become richer i'll tend to spend more.

so the hoarder at some point stops / starts spending more, but we don't know until it happens and it's different for every one of us


imagine this: you win the lottery. will you spend more? probably. 
money deflation is like slowly winning the lottery.

">China

The biggest improvement in quality of life in human history was under a Communist regime. The Communist Party is still in power in China today, although obviously the economy is no longer collectivized -- China's economy is something like a quasi-centrally-planned market system.

>Venezuela

70% of GDP in Venezuela is from the private sector. Nationalizing one resource doesn't automatically make you a socialist state.

">  All the things you said apply to both scenarios.

yes, but in inflation scenarios people tend to overinvest and squander resources.

> When I say discourage, I mean encourage a little less.

ok good! and why this should be bad?

Econ101: savings are key to growth.

this btw was the 8th chapter in my old econ textbook

so if i consume a little less and save a little more i'll get more growth. it's really simple and easy.

btw i'm not thinking in extremes, i'm just showing you that your arguments are nuts pointing out what happens in extremes. if your arguments were sane they would hold up even in extremes circumstances, but they are not.

> If the car puts out 3% productivity, then it discourages buying the car.

and what if it's 2017 and i can buy bitcoins? 
this will discourage purchasing as well. no need for deflation

>Your comments don't even make sense. Read them.

fine ;)

anyway there is bitcoin and it is deflationary. 
your bogus theories are going the way of the dinosaurs, no matter what you say/believe/hope.

cheers :)

You keep asserting this, but it doesn't make sense. With deflation, you'll get continuous underinvestment. If it's your opinion that that's ok, then I guess we have to agree to disagree.

When using a source as part of an argument, it helps that you quote it or provide a reference. Referencing the IDEA of a source, isn't referencing a source.

> btw i'm not thinking in extremes, i'm just showing you that your arguments are nuts pointing out what happens in extremes. if your arguments were sane they would hold up even in extremes circumstances, but they are not.

If cars sold for $1, then the car companies would go bankrupt.

Wait, are you basing your arguments on some sort of tribal feeling? Are you imagining that I said Bitcoin is going to disappear? Get that feeling out of your heart. I think bitcoin has growth in it, but not solely because of deflation. If deflation was the only thing backing Bitcoin, it would be a scam.

">Seriously China have best quality of life by communism ?

That's not what I said.

>And by Venezuela the state have total control over the economy to the point to dictate what price the private sector should sell and creating massive bankruptcies and penury(hence the toilet paper penury)...

You are objectively incorrect. The Venezuelan state does not have total control of the economy. Public control of GDP is barely higher than that of France, and much lower than that of Cuba (your other favorite socialist bogeyman, no doubt).
