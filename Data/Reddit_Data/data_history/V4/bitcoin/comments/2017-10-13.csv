Oh! My understanding was that if you owned 1BTC before the fork then after the fork you would own 1BTC *or* 1BCH.

But really you would own 1BTC *and* 1BCH?! So you could sell 0.5BCH and afterwards you would still own 1BTC + 0.5BCH?

I assumed that selling from one fork would reduce your holdings in the other by the same amount (i.e. selling 0.5BCH would leave you with 0.5BTC + 0.5BCH), so you would have to choose one or the other.";3;2;False;fallofmath;dob0dki;Bitcoin breaks $5500, less than one day after it broke $5000.;761ri4;https://i.redd.it/f2p8tajk9irz.gif

Gemini is an exchange where you can purchase BTC (bitcoin) and ETH (ethereum).

"I've taken it upon myself to hand out information in this thread. Like cheap candy. Because I blindly stumbled into bitcoin, I want to help anyone interested in bitcoin that might have stumbled on to it here. Personally, I recommend /r/bitcoinbeginners, and bitcointalk.org. They're good at explaining things if you ask respectfully. I can answer questions, but I'm no pro (despite 2 and a half years experience in bitcoin)

Well, I dont know much about investing ether :P... but I *do* have reasons. Primary one of which is that I believe in bitcoin, so I'm always looking to buy in. I have some of my bitcoin stash that I'm never selling, and I have some that I sell when there is a big movement up... like now (well, I don't operate *exactly* like that, but it's a close enough approximation, I guess). Bitcoin saw a ~20% increase in value in about 2 days ($4700-$5800), that usually doesn't happen without the price correcting downwards. I sold at about $5700, and I want to buy back at $5200 because its roughly a 10% decrease from the top. So that's where I want to buy back in.

As you can see in [this price chart for Bitstamp.com (exchange)](https://bitcoinwisdom.com/markets/bitstamp/btcusd), the price has rallied hard and corrected hard. Specially this year (if you click on 12h, you should be able to see most of this year, depending on screen resolution), bitcoin has had a clear uptrend. But sometimes bitcoin can over-extend into bubble territory, like it did in 2013. That year, it rallied from $100 to $1000 and everyone was saying $10,000 was the price 2014 would be at... but the price crashed **HARD**. The market went into a hard downtrend, it crashed from $1000 to $200 over the course of 2014 and a slow recovery happened in Jan 2015- March 2017. You can see the entire price history on that chart if you click on 1w.

We're rallying hard, but I don't think we're in quite at bubble territory yet, although, I would be cautious if we got near $8000 this year. So... yeah.

I also think ETH is a good long term buy. They are targeting a different market than Bitcoin, and have a similar first mover advantage in their niche like Bitcoin does. 

Both certainly have downsides, and could absolutely fail.

I'm less sold on litecoin. It seems like it is a solution to a problem that doesn't, or won't, exist. Bitcoin is divisible, and doesn't really need a silver to bitcoin's gold, assuming Bitcoin solves it's scaling issues. If it doesn't, I think that completely changes everything and betting on LTC is still a big unknown.

If your looking to day trade, and don't mind the excessive research necessary to do so successfully, then none of the cryptos coinbase offers can really compete with the potential of up and comers. Monero, Zcash, Dash, Ripple, NEO, OMG, Ark, etc, all have much more short term upside potential, but they are also a lot riskier. Their price increases also don't necessarily correlate with the fundamentals of the cryptocurrency as much as they are influenced by speculation and hype. So more risk and reward in alts, but also a lot more difficult to make informed decisions.

This is not investment advice, just my personal opinion on the crypto space right now. Things change so fast that everything I just said could be obsolete and wrong within a few weeks, but that is my quick assessment as I see it today.";2;0;False;D4200;dobsqoz;Bitcoin breaks $5500, less than one day after it broke $5000.;761ri4;https://i.redd.it/f2p8tajk9irz.gif

"The number one rule of bitcoin is to never store your bitcoin on an exchange. Start now learning how to use a wallet that you control the keys for.

It is critically important at first to learn how to use a light wallet like electrum. Start with learning how to transfer small amounts. You should learn how to store your seeds and wallets, delete your wallets, and reinstate them from the seeds. You need to safely secure those seeds, because if they are stolen your money can be gone in an instant. Start small first and learn. There is no rush. Bitcoin is about financial sovereignity. As long as you have to login to an exchange to access your bitcoin, it isn't your bitcoin, it's an IOU.

"> What do you think else would be the value? 

The thing that it is counter-intuitive about crypto, is that the solution to electronic anonymous and censorship resistant money, turned out being record everything forever. When someone can flick a switch and take everything from you, you don't have freedom. When you can access the ledger from anyone, prove that it it is valid, and be able to send your money to anyone, for whatever purpose, you do.

It is my opinion that this technology has been developed as a direct response to the insidious and anti-democratic implementation of AML/KYC laws on a global scale over the past 30 years. The extrapolation of these laws, given a long enough timeline, is slavery. Not figurative slavery, actual slavery.

Bitcoin is the technical response to that problem.

"**Ronald Wayne**

Ronald Gerald Wayne (born May 17, 1934) is an American retired electronics industry worker. He co-founded Apple Computer (now Apple Inc.) with Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs, providing administrative oversight for the new venture. He soon, however, sold his share of the new company for $800 US dollars, and later accepted $1,500 to forfeit any claims against Apple (in total, equivalent to $9,296 in 2016). As of March 2017, if Wayne had kept his 10% stake in Apple Inc., it would have been worth over $75.5 billion.

Market rules

Insider trading, collusion, cartels, manipulation, etc are all common on the unregulated market that dictates the value, fluctuations and volatility of Bitcoin. 

The volatility which prevents it from approaching anywhere near being a usable currency. Retailers accepting BTC are down. 

It still gets use as a type of money - unfortunately it excels at blackmarket use, randomware, laundering (combined with other coins) and eye-watering amounts of tax evasion 

The tech is great - but large industry are realising they can create their own safer, centralised blockchain and DL tech

It's a speculative cashcow. If it disappeared tomorrow, the world wouldn't blink - why? because there's no reliance on it.

Bitcoin only started to gain real value about 4 years ago. The problem with Bitcoin is that popularity is the only thing feeding into it, the technology is rapidly increasing and superior blockchains already exist like Ethereum which can have long lasting utilization by companies. All it takes is one massive scare and a shift to a different coin to bankrupt bitcoin's value. It's still too fragile, although there is no doubt that some blockchain in the future will have a very real and very applicable worth beyond mostly speculation and black market use.;6;1;False;salgat;doaxqg3;Bitcoin breaks $5500, less than one day after it broke $5000.;761ri4;https://i.redd.it/f2p8tajk9irz.gif

"I was trying to talk my friends in 2010 to invest $500 each and they all said no so I didn't.

People here like to say I would be a billionaire having money fights with Bill Gates but the fact of the matter is you wouldn't have.

Other online friends all cashed out when their investment hit $200 per coin and most of the millionaires you hear about now literally forgot they even owned coins and just had a nice surprise when they found out they had some.

If you would have followed the history of bitcoins, many times sites closed and took your coins and many didn't get refunds.  People were hacked if they kept their coins not secure on their computers as well which made it an annoyance as well.

I felt that if I would have invested in BTC back then, I would have lost the coins up until the point they became worth what they are today.  I mean hell, the drive I would have kept them on doesn't even work anymore.

As for getting into it now, it is a gamble and I'd suggest maxing out other retirement accounts prior to investing into BTC.

This is what some people don't think about enough: as long as you HODL all forks, you can't be harmed, and which particular one ""succeeds"" if in aggregate the sum total goes up in value makes the fear of forks irrational.  

I think BTC will win out anyways, but as long as you own pre-fork and HODL for a long time at least until the fork ""winner"" shakes out... you have nothing to worry about.

The private key is associated with the wallet, the account.  When you transfer btc, it leaves one wallet/account and goes to another.

Coinbase customers *right now* do NOT have access to their BCash. Understand why?).

"It's a conclusion I've arrived at after studying the technology, arguments for and arguments against.  I'll try and briefly summarize why I think that.

I think the current price of bitcoin is almost entirely based on price speculation and people trying to profitably trade it.  I think almost none of the current value the market is pricing it at is based on the actual underlying technology.  The largest buyers and sellers of bitcoin don't want the actual coin, they want more dollars than they have now.  I think that because of those underlying facts, it will never be stable enough to actually be used as a serious currency and will remain a speculative asset, only drawing in more speculators in the short run.  I think bitcoin has a price floor of whatever it costs to actually mine, but I don't think it'll end up being priced at much more than that once enough people are no longer interested in speculating, which could end up not being for quite some time.  When I say it's a bubble, I don't mean this is the top, bitcoin could end up going to $10,000 or $20,000 or some other very high price, but I think it will come crashing down very hard very quickly in the end.

"First off, I understand at a technical level what bitcoin is. Sounds like youareverysmart...

Secondly, bitcoin very much fits my world view. However, if we want to encourage global adoption, the purchasing power of bitcoin needs to be stable.

Followup question: do existing public businesses who transact and pay taxes in central bank dollars - but also accept payment in bitcoin (i.e. Amazon, MS, etc.) - do these businesses hedge the volatility of the currency? With 10% ""forex / exchange"" swings per day, hedging would be difficult and expensive.

Or - do such businesses hold that bitcoin in reserve and use it to purchase with suppliers / employees who accept bitcoin?";1;1;False;;dob7omu;Bitcoin breaks $5500, less than one day after it broke $5000.;761ri4;https://i.redd.it/f2p8tajk9irz.gif

"Yea that’s my point. Gold has held a value much greater than its actual manufacturing use because it’s a good store of value. It doesn’t corrode, it’s easily split up and malleable. It shows a store of value has a lot of demand. If bitcoin took just a fraction of gold (say 1 trillion) it would be around 50k per bitcoin. That doesn’t include any other market like remittances or blockchain storage.

Bitcoin will always have booms and busts but if you look at gold the daily price movements are minimal. Much better for a currency and it’s because of its higher liquidity. I don’t see bitcoin being used in any great volume for transactions until bitcoin is big enough that volatility is decreased to the level gold.

"That's a moot point. 

First of all, if Bitcoin replaces money - yearly growth will be less than 5%, since without new people getting into it the value can only grow with the economy/population growth. 

Even if you imagine crazy growth like x10 every year - it is only applicable if you have something else to spend. It is regrettable to see that pizza costed a million dollars not because Bitcoin increased in value, but because dollar didn't. You were left with something that stayed the same, while something else became valuable. And it's easy to see this on the example.

let's say it's year 0, Bitcoin is worth 1$ and price is multiplying tenfold every year. 
let's say you have $100 dollars to your name and you buy $10 pizza every year.

Now in your case you have let's say 20% of your worth in bitcoin, so 20 BTC and 80$. 
If you decide to pay for pizza in Bitcoin your balance will look like that:

* Year 0 - 10 BTC + $80 (10$ 10 BTC pizza)
* Year 1 - 9 BTC + $80 (10$ 1 BTC pizza)
* Year 2 - 8.9 BTC + $80 (10$ 0.1 BTC pizza)
* Year 3 - 8.89 BTC + $80 (10$ 0.01 BTC pizza)

So now your balance is equivalent of $8 890 + $80. If you think back you see that you could have saved 20 BTC and payed in cash, and you would have $20 000 +  $40. That's your point - why would anyone spend BTC then?

BUT if you get rid of cash equivalent and only have 100 BTC. 
Your balance will look like that:

* Year 0 - 90 BTC (10$ 10 BTC pizza)
* Year 1 - 89 BTC (10$ 1 BTC pizza)
* Year 2 - 88.9 BTC (10$ 0.1 BTC pizza)
* Year 3 - 88.89 BTC (10$ 0.01 BTC pizza)

So now your balance is equivalent of $88 890. And now you could think that you could have $100 000 if you didn't buy the pizza in year 0, but now it's completely irrelevant since you payed for the goods you wanted at the appropriate price at the time and there's no alternative way to buy it cheaper.

">That is an oxymoron. Crypto without decentralization is simply a digital token.

Not at all. e.g. banks in conjunction with other banks are developing their own blockchain and especially DL tech to speed up linear processes internally, such as cross-border settlement. Many banks are engaging in this, I know this, I work in the industry, I am sitting a few meters away from our development whitepaper on this.

For example, market infrastructure, such as a settlement bank requires a huge amount of linear processes to service their clients (banks). With their own blockchain and DL tech (including developing crypto with smart contracts) they can streamline activity and cut costs

Banks are also (tentatively) joining public blockchains such as RippleNet (as a service and most in the testing phase)

Market infrastructure with 400 to 1400 clients can operate a distributed ledger with tech built on top - and have nothing to do with the risky, volatile, unregulated secondary market

The technology that BTC uses a long the way can be used by others in their development of their own BC and DL tech - but the actual use of BTC is entirely separate

There is zero industry need for BTC, like I said, it could die tomorrow and everything would continue on as normal

"Hate to break it to you but that's exactly how your dollars currently work as well. Fiat currency has a store of value and once it's converted to 1's and 0's it's just sitting there waiting to be converted back into dollars once transactions happen. Whatever value the dollar is when you convert back is what gets pulled. More similar to Venmo or Paypal balances. Just digital currency that get converted back to dollars but currencies no less. 

Not if I'm swiping my card. The point of sale transaction happens the moment I swipe and the value of the currency in that moment is the cost I pay. I don't need to sell, that's on Shift. When I swipe my card it's an instantaneous transaction on my end that goes into a ledger on Shift's end of when I made the transaction and the value of BTC in that moment. Sometimes, like last night, when the value shoots up unexpectedly I'll use my card to buy any big ticket items or pay any debts/bills I owe for the month before the value corrects a bit a few hours later. 

You're speaking to a broader scope of people but if you choose to use it as a currency the absolute option is there. It's a currency if you want it to be.

The Vigenère (French pronunciation: ​[viʒnɛːʁ]) cipher has been reinvented many times. The method was originally described by Giovan Battista Bellaso in his 1553 book La cifra del.

"**Gold standard**

A gold standard is a monetary system in which the standard economic unit of account is based on a fixed quantity of gold. Three types can be distinguished: specie, bullion, and exchange.

In the gold specie standard the monetary unit is associated with the value of circulating gold coins, or the monetary unit has the value of a certain circulating gold coin, but other coins may be made of less valuable metal.

The gold bullion standard is a system in which gold coins do not circulate, but the authorities agree to sell gold bullion on demand at a fixed price in exchange for the circulating currency.

First I created and secured my wallet (including encrypting it, and making and testing a backup). I did this by downloading Bitcoin Core and running it in my laptop, but you could use any other wallet software.

Once I was confident in my secure but empty wallet, I went to the exchange (I used bitstamp.net, but I suppose other exchanges are similar). I created an account, got it validated (involved uploading a photo of and ID), and did a SEPA transfer of euros from my bank (SEPA is a standard way to transfer money in Europe; in this case I transferred to a bank account given to me in the exchange's website). Two or three days later, the exchange's website showed my euros. At that point I just put an order to buy Bitcoin (simple operation in the exchange's website), and then did a withdraw to an address in my Bitcoin wallet (another simple operation in the exchange's website).

"The real currencies are in turmoil because the countries are in turmoil, cause people start to think that existing concepts should be replaced, everything is in more chaos, but that doesn't make those concepts obsolete. And no, ""The internet"" is no economical room, that is the point, cause its all covered by other economical rooms. Your internet is in Country X and so all things happening with the internet in your country impact the economical value of your country and so your country currency, which means whatever you do with bitcoins in your country _IS_ impacting your currency, if you want it or not, you didnt ""switched"" currency, you just used another product. That is what you have to understand. If now a country says ""We use bitcoin as currency"" and so do not have any other currency in their country that is covered by the government (the ruler of this economical zone) then it would have an own economical zone........... and that country would be probably doomed forever 8-) You must see, its not all about how you see it from your little point of view of yourself, you must see the big picture, and if you do not reflect a economical _ZONE_ (like a PHYSICAL AREA of people doing TRADE inside and outside) then you are not a currency, period. There are often in many countries those alternative ""currencies"", introduced in local areas, ""Freigeld"", a very good concept hopefully gets the currency concept in the world longtime, but beside this, this ""Freigeld""-experimental islands are STILL not an own currency, even tho they are sold and traded like a currency and even probably covered by government, but they are still just tools of cashflow inside the complete economical zone of the currency the country has.

And your little scenario with all the money lost, you must see other around: If you can't lose the money when your country gets broke, then it was never there for the country, so it MIGHT BE that even you participated to make the country broke with moving its value into bitcoins so massivly that the actual currency the ACTUAL economical value reflected of the economical zone gets broke. It is like, you can't ""replace"" currency, it is just there. Even if a country is not making up a currency, it WILL have a currency in some other form, it might be not messured but it exist. Would be kinda cranky for the world market if they do not have a ""number"" on that country, but it has to sort in the things coming (and going) to the country. Oh right there are actually countries without an OWN currency, but using another ones currency. They still are an economical zone and so still have a value on their own, but this value must be calculated all the time in context of the currency, so people in those countries have pretty wonky prices, but that is then their currency, even if its not theirs.

You really need to see that currency is not something we really made up. The concept of money is not bad, the extreme freedom of the financial market is, but not money itself. That is like literally driving all the people to bitcoin, thinking that it gives them a security they dont have else, but that is just a cloud, if there is suddenly no one taking bitcoins anymore, because the government made it highly illegal (could also happen) then you would see the value going down, INDEPENDENT of the still thousands and thousands of people using and trading with it, but the real demand goes way down and so its value. It is just a product, bound to its own reality, not to the reality of a complete country.

It is like 2 layers which are looking like they are exchangeable but they arent. Money is there no matter what. BTW: In Germany you have to pay taxes for Bitcoin, they are regular income, so the government wants you to report those bitcoins (if you are a company getting paid with them), they are really not that much of a different world, as they have always be bend into the existing structures.

If you say Bitcoin can be a currency replacement, then Putin is just happy that there can be more chaos made around the world. Bitcoin is nothing more as a trading good, a trading good with a gigantic speculation range... why is that gigantic speculation range? Cause its nothing more than a cloud of illusions :) It is like the same with the rise of USD after presidental vote.... Every 4 years directly after the president is voted it, the USD rises like crazy, no matter what president is voted (even if its a revote of the same one), just because there is so much ""illusion"" about the brand new america that comes up, so half the people invest invest invest (the half who waited for this specific president, the other half is unhappy and doesnt invest, but that doesnt crush the huge amount invested from the first half).

BTW: What bothers me most actually about all this, is the fact that Bitcoin is so trackable, that we will have a time, where if you pay at a shop with bitcoins, the police will come and handcuff you, cause you might have a bitcoin that went through an illegal deal before. I really have no idea how that helps you to get ""independent"" from the government, if the using of the bitcoins is literally putting you near unrelated criminal activity with prove.

"I didn’t mean to sound condescending when I mentioned not knowing enough about Bitcoin. My apologies for that. It’s just a lot of times the people saying bubble only think of bitcoin as a currency trying to take over the dollar which is very far from what it is and what it’s doing.

Yes I do think bitcoin is overvalued. I think it was undervalued below 2k. But that’s just today. The ruler keeps moving as companies come on board and developers innovate on the protocol. So tomorrow (or realistically 6months from now) I’ll say under 3k is undervalued. 

I do think we are in mostly agreement. I only mentioned the US market to illustrate some people’s bias toward something they know and something that’s new. In this case they are both overvalued probably. But that only means there will be a correction in the short term and then continued growth.

Just because there is a bubble doesn’t mean you shouldn’t invest. I’m still contributing to my retirement accounts even though I think the US market is in a bubble. That’s because I know when it corrects I’ll keep buying and over time I’ll end up even better than where I started. 

I just think when people say there is a bitcoin bubble they are meaning that bitcoin isn’t a good investment because it may decrease in value in the short term. What I’m saying is that doesn’t matter because long term the trend is still up after the correction.";1;0;False;the_zukk;dobn63k;Bitcoin breaks $5500, less than one day after it broke $5000.;761ri4;https://i.redd.it/f2p8tajk9irz.gif
"So back on my PC, a bit more efficient with wording here ;)
I'm not a native english speaker aswell so, don't worry, looks perfectly fine to me.
So, just to be clear, what would your definitions for a currency exactly be, what points must something fulfill to be counted as currency? When I look it up, I see so many different opinions about that, I ain't even sure if there is a final made up defintion for a currency that counts as this world wide. Also I do agree with your points about the economical value to some degree, but the ""real currencies"" right now are also in a big turmoil of speculations, where usually the currency gambling does not have as much impact as political/eviromental happenings might have, since these currencies are mostly established for a very long time and the whole volume is just too big to really have a noticable impact on it. 
(Illegal Trading is currently mostly covered by $ in cash)
If you want/need to name an economical room for the Bitcoin, I think I would simply answer that question with, the internet. It's the money of the internet and it has a lot of followers (Altcoins), which also are mooning quiet hard, even though they didn't reach this astronomical heights yet, but hey, we are still in the ""early adopter"" phase, so there is so much more room to grow here. And if you look at the Value Gains over most of the top 10 Cryptos this year, almost all of them have gon up by multiple 100%.
Also there is a very big demand for what cryptos provide. Easy accessible, mostly decentralized, private, fast, cheap and global. After having gone through multiple fuck ups by big banks, having seen an uncountable amount of people lose all there saving in between hours, after seeing the crash from 2008 and it's consequences, you have to admit, there has to be something ""better"". And let's say Bitcoin - (because there are so many cryptos already with so many different goals, aspects and intentions) - does provide a lot or all of that. It provides what currencies are meant to do and much more. So in my eyes, why shouldn't it be a worthy currency, that is global and for everyone with internet access and a propper devise acessible, without giving out your personal details to anyone, and still you can be sure that when you send x to B and you put in the correct reciepent adress, that the amout will be there in a pretty specific amount of time, for whatever reason you are paying B. Currencies are in no way as stable as you say, Look what happened in SImbabwe, look what happens in Venezuela, what happens in India... Money suddenly loses all of it's value do to central banks printing it out like crazy and driving up inflation as never seen before. Everything you had stored in a Bankaccount is gone, in hours.
Bitcoin will in my honest opinion probably more be some kind of a store value like gold. In the end the market and the users will tecide what it will be used for and if it survives, becomes more valuable and less volatile, all of that the future will show, like I said, we are still in a very early phase of cryptos. (If bitcoin will survive, just to be clear, I say cruptocurrencies will be the thing in the future, but in no way I can tell if it's bitcoin any other or even multiple coins with different values)

Anyone that's been in crypto any amount of time knew that was bs, and got in right before the fork to get both coins. That isn't the reason why everything is going up though. A side effect of these 'free coins' was that people just sold them off and put the money in more Bitcoins.

After that fork, Bitcoin rose from $2.8k to $4.3k AND all the altcoins pumped extremely hard in a recursive feedback loop. Bitcoin pump -> Altcoin pump -> Bitcoin pump -> Altcoin pump etc.

Why is every post that hits the front page from r/bitcoin about how much money is being made instead of how many people are being helped?

Daily transactions haven't increased in the past year despite a 5x increase in value. That's not ""investment"", its just lots of money being pumped into an artificially scarce asset.

People buying up millions of dollars worth of bitcoins, not to use as currency, but to speculate on, does not help anyone, it simply makes the price unstable and discourages anyone from actually using it as currency because why would people spend it as currency when its increasing in value so much?

"Yea paper or hard wallet is best. Leaving on exchange youre at the mercy of them doing work to give you your coins. Aside from all the other risks..

Any, and every, future fork... exists now inside your Bitcoin. All future forks will stem from the current chain (**although, some may fork from forks.. like Bcash, so I guess you'd have to hodl that as well).

If you hodl, forks shouldn't bother you.. I've been learning this recently from some others that I follow. It's starting to make a lot of sense.

Edit: the forks from forks point is important. I didn't mean to imply forks will *only* come from main chain. Because they may not, and many predict there could be hundreds more forks in the near future, it only makes sense to 

1) Acquire the earliest branch(es) you can because *choosing* the correct one later is harder than hodling ""all"" forks early..

2) Not sell the forked coin. The total price adds up to an increasing total, so fear of ""Bitcoin"" losing price is unfounded, and... day to day price swings are less important than letting the differences of the coins play out over time.

"Could be ;). Relevant is that the complete world is splitted into those economical zones which is reflected by this currency. All currencies of the world together make the ""(economical) value"" of the world (Which is currently 150-250 trillion dollar depending on who you ask). Everything else, the products and everything else (including bitcoin) is ""under"" this layer of currencies. You influence currencies, you actually take away value from the economical room and put it in a ""moving"" state, its like the ""(economical) value"" of the bitcoin is frozen in some way, but luckily the more is frozen in bitcoin to more the ""(economical) value"" will sink, as it is less contributing to the complete picture. Keeping it moving is like literally keeping it ""In the mouth"" and so people want that product, and given that this product is designed to be handled LIKE a currency, you can see that price change like instantly, its a special thing, other companies could do the same and recalculate their product prices every day live, while they are on demand or not, but that is just administrative kinda waste of resources ;-). Overall I think you should understand that a currency MUST reflect an economical room.

What I _DO_ admit here is: Bitcoin might have an ""economical"" room in the illegal trade, given that illegal trading (slaves, guns, biological warfare, chemical warfare, explosives) was never covered in any economical room, you MIGHT can go as argumentation that Bitcoin (or all crypto currencies combined, all 1000<) reflect this economical room. But that is not like the picture you might want from the money you earn with it ;).

So under the line: Every product is gamble, even every currency is gamble, but a product can suddenly lose its value when the product has a problem or is out of sense or whatever, while a currency is stable by concept, as stable as all the products of the economical area combined. Might be that a storm comes and wipes out the complete economical area and makes it pretty worthless, but you must admit, in no scenario of the world you would say that wiping out a country physical would be going without fundamental changes to values.

P.S.: Always in this context a very important point: That is why the EURO introduction was so ""easy"". They literally defined one economical room out of them all, and made the value of it mathematical based on the dimension and value of those economical rooms before. And then just ""Let it go"", they did technical not 1 bit more. The rest was covered through the european union trade contracts before, always super fascinating for me how ""easy"" that goes. Doing the same with products is just not possible, people do not accept that Product A and Product B should be enforced as one product, you would also say that another crypto currency is NOT the same as bitcoin, but all argumentations for ""bitcoin is a currency"" are things that are attributes of all crypto currencies, so TECHNICAL they are all the same solution for the problem, but ..... oh boy.... only the one that is mentioned in every article in the world about crypto currencies explodes like hell.

"There are not infinite use cases for bitcoin. So in my opinion, when bitcoin reaches full market penetration in whichever markets it is disrupting it will stop growing. Or only grow as that market grows. 

So for example if bitcoin is a big player in the remittance market, it could take over the $585B market. Which would put bitcoin at around $34,000. At that point bitcoin would only grow as fast as the remittance market grows. 

Then you can use that logic and apply it to whatever market you think bitcoin might dip a toe into. Such as a store of value (disrupting the $7 Trillion gold market), or micro payments, or cloud storage, etc.

I mentioned 25 years earlier, because in my mind, that might be the soonest time when there might be a fundamental shift from ""how much is bitcoin worth in terms of USD?"", and more toward ""how many USD is that worth in terms of bitcoin?""

They want to get coins before it reaches 10k, which they are now convinced is entirely possible by the end of 2017. But more importantly, they are salavating over the upcoming hardfork, where 'free money' can be made in the split.

Some people made a lot of money off their BCH. The 2x hardfork is going to be even crazier. Be very careful all, getting greedy can backfire, and you don't want to be the sap selling off BTC for BCH thinking you've been gifted a new, cheap price to buy in.

"It won’t be a currency until two things happen. The first is it will level off after significant market penetration. More liquidity will bring down volatility. The second is when second layer protocols are completed. Then you can do anything from micro to macro transactions with minimal fees. 

Until then it is speculation on the first decentralized secure trustless protocol. Every time a company builds a new service on the network it increases its utility. Every time its utility increases its demand increases. It’s also a store of value completely decoupled from the current financial system. A hedge against the rest of the market. That alone is worth a lot. I can see very soon every person who owns stocks or mutual funds also hold 10 percent in bitcoin in case of another recession. Similar to gold.

Of course today the majority of value comes from speculation that utility will come. And many times the price gets ahead of reality. But it’s a positive feedback loop. Each time the price rises. It brings in new developers and funds the current developers even more to continue innovation. More innovation pushes the price up.

"> wasn't bitcoins value in being a frictionless form of exchange for goods and services on the internet. 

That was certainly part of the original vision.  Also a store of value.  Today, it has also become the reserve currency for all other cryptocurrencies.  But I believe its current value is mostly due to people realizing the huge potential of decentralized currencies in general, and bitcoin being the market leader and backbone.  Consider being an early investor in Apple, Amazon or Google.  Let's say 15-20 years ago.  Companies with a big vision and lots of potential, but also the potential to fail spectacularly and lose your money.  Does Bitcoin have issues with scalability, regulation, governance, and usability today?  Yes.  Are those unsolvable problems that fundamentally doom cyrptocurrencies and can never be fixed no matter how many smart people throw billions of dollars at them over the next few decades?  History suggests such problems get solved rather quickly once the technology is there.

"I feel the same as I did the same. 

I was in year 13 and had a part time job where I was earning like £40/week. Bitcoin was worth Just under $0.1

My friend (who was well off) bought 1000 (for under £100) and suggested I do the same. I was in a band at the time and most of my money went into that. I didn't realise quite how the technology worked at the time, so I blew it off and paid my share for a recording session for my band instead with that money.  

A year later and it was worth like 100 times what it was in 2010. I realised I'd missed a trick, but it was too late, as far as I was concerned. I had like no money and was saving up for university and for music projects. 

By this stage, my idiot of a friend had spent well over 80% of his Bitcoin on drugs. This sent the message to me that it was only really useful for drugs and not much else and so I, again, didn't invest. 

I forever regret my decision not to put even £10 into it when it was $0.1. Even 100 would have put me at being in a very different life right now. ";1;0;False;dude2dudette;dob2bsa;Bitcoin breaks $5500, less than one day after it broke $5000.;761ri4;https://i.redd.it/f2p8tajk9irz.gif

"I think the most fundamental aspect of bitcoin right now is that everyone thinks they can get rich off it and the fear of missing out, which is why I continue to sit on the sideline.

Yes I've been wrong from a total return perspective but I have only seen this fundamental strengthen over time with more exposure to the public.

I come into these threads and all the posts are ""How do I get into Bitcoin [for the crazy returns]"", ""I got rich off Bitcoin"", ""I regret not buying Bitcoin earlier because I would be rich"".

Never do I hear people talking about improvements in their daily life from Bitcoin or the block-chain technology. 

Transactions in BTC are cumbersome: USD -> BTC, trade in BTC, BTC -> USD. It's essentially an in-kind transfer. Exchange in purely USD is far more efficient. This is because nothing is priced purely in BTC. BTC price is USD price translated at the current price of BTC in USD.

While I think block-chain technology is very interesting and can challenge current payment tech, I don't see it doing this in its current form and especially BTC.

"Someone explain this to me.

If one person held all the bitcoins in the world, it would be useless because it has no value. You could have all the [meme]coins ever invented, if you are the only person who trades it, it becomes meaningless since no other person can get any return out of it.

Things that are artificially made/sourced in a market without fair competition have value because of the demand for them. How scarce it is is explicitly NOT a factor. Diamonds are not rare at all, there is just a high demand for them and maximum profits are obtained at selling at a high price (prices are absolutely not subject to competition and demand).

The question I want to ask people, is why is demand for bitcoin so high? Who are the people out there paying for it? Is it as I fear, and the people who have the highest demand for it, are actually bitcoin miners themselves, thus in a feedback loop? If this is actually the case, I think there is a serious problem and bitcoin is 100% in a bubble. If you have a scheme where new entrants pay real money to get some [meme]coin and the only way to increase your share of [meme]coin is by encouraging other new entrants to pay more money to increase the value of your [meme]coin, this goes right the way to the top where the overall owner is filthy rich.

I'm making some stretches there but the points I make about who is dragging the price up has to be addressed and the answer absolutely can not be 'supply and demand' because supply is 100% not involved here (there are no competing sources), the demand is.";12;9;False;DBrowny;doaxvr9;Bitcoin breaks $5500, less than one day after it broke $5000.;761ri4;https://i.redd.it/f2p8tajk9irz.gif

"**Tulip mania**

Tulip mania, tulipmania, or tulipomania (Dutch names include: tulpenmanie, tulpomanie, tulpenwoede, tulpengekte and bollengekte) was a period in the Dutch Golden Age during which contract prices for bulbs of the recently introduced tulip reached extraordinarily high levels and then dramatically collapsed in February 1637. It is generally considered the first recorded speculative bubble (or economic bubble); although some researchers have noted that the Kipper- und Wipperzeit (literally Tipper and See-saw) episode in 1619–1622, a Europe-wide chain of debasement of the metal content of coins to fund warfare, featured mania-like similarities to a bubble. In many ways, the tulip mania was more of a hitherto unknown socio-economic phenomenon than a significant economic crisis (or financial crisis). And historically, it had no critical influence on the prosperity of the Dutch Republic, the world's leading economic and financial power in the 17th century.

"I credit this general factor more heavily than the various other drivers. (Or rather, adoption may be the primary factor catalyzing several others.) I think we're beginning to see effects from some influential institutional investors' buy-in/capitulation. Consider, for instance, https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/12/analyst-sees-momentum-in-blockchain-technology-likes-credit-cards.html . This would also help explain why we are seeing big jumps in certain BaaS crypto-fintech coins/tokens, as well as strong recent showings from some ""stable-ish"" coins, unrelated to the BTC fork (e.g., LTC). 
Lastly--and MOST telling, IMO--is a parallel surge of interest in blockchain-related  securities on even traditional, regulated stock exchanges (e.g., BIOP on NASD, or BTLLF, PRELF and many others OTC)...

"> First of all, that's not how markets work. You can't just buy something from yourself and drive the price up, unless you have infinite supply of either money or goods.

Bitcoin isn't a market though. A market has multiple suppliers and multiple customers. Bitcoin has 1 supplier like with diamonds.

And your analogy of buying something yourself to drive the price up is very wrong. I'm not talking about individuals buying from themselves, I'm talking about those who stand to make a profit from an investment, buying from other investors. Its the makings of a ponzi scheme.

Observe house prices and retirees buying investment homes. You have someone with 2 houses selling one of them to someone with 2 houses themselves. The investor is going to have a lot more money and collateral than someone without a house, so they drive the price up by outbidding first-home buyers. The seller earns an inflated profit which they then use in another auction, buying from another retiree and outbidding the first home buyer with the excess profit from the first sale. Repeat forever and you now live in Sydney/Vancouver. That's not a wild scenario, its real life for tens of millions of people.

That's what I see with bitcoin, all the trading and selling is coming from people already in 'the game'. Someone has a lot of bitcoin, so they up their mining efforts to ultimately reduce the amount that all other players own since there is a finite amount. If bitcoin reaches a point where buying into it is unfeasible, the instant a negative trendline develops, no one is going to buy it at all and there will be mass sell off among those that have a lot. No one is going to sit around as their portfolio goes from $100k to $90k overnight which will trigger mass sell offs. This is distinctly difference to something like a house where houses will always have intrinsic value and can't drop too far. Bitcoin has no intrinsic value at all and can go to $0.

And that point will happen, the more bitcoin grows in value the less people can afford to buy into it. It seems to me like the only thing encouraging people to buy into it, thus increasing its value is the fact its going up. When that graph hits its peak and moves down I don't see how bitcoin can recover.";0;1;False;DBrowny;dobbxwa;Bitcoin breaks $5500, less than one day after it broke $5000.;761ri4;https://i.redd.it/f2p8tajk9irz.gif

"The thing about bitcoin is that its not ready to be a currency. It's just not ready. We're in the early days of this ""new type of money"", and time will tell whether it really works as a currency, economically speaking.

Mechanically speaking, it's about as good as cash. I have a friend in LA, I live in Guatemala. I can send them 0.05 bitcoin  (currently worth about $260) in 30 minutes, at the click of a button. If I wanted to send them $260 I have, I'd have to go to my bank, line up, then send them the money through moneygram. That should take me about an hour.

What I described in the previous paragraph is why I believe in bitcoin. There are things that need to be worked out, like price volatility, which isnt too good for currency. But it works, and it just needs to work for long enough to start accumulating users... and ideally, more users means more stability. An example I like to use is Netflix. Netflix wasn't ready to be the streaming service juggernaut it is now, back in 2001. But they developed a service that worked, and it kept working consistently... now it rivals DVDs, when it comes to home entertainment. 

I believe Bitcoin already rivals some fiat currencies, when it comes to worldwide usage. It's somewhere between the Zimbabwe dollar (practically worthless) and the US dollar (of considerable worth).";9;3;False;BlackSpidy;dobm9yr;Bitcoin breaks $5500, less than one day after it broke $5000.;761ri4;https://i.redd.it/f2p8tajk9irz.gif

it's only volatile right now because less than 1% of the global population is involved in it, so distribution is low and price seeking is high as it opens into new markets. As the technology improves and cryptocurrencies disseminate all over the world and billions of people begin to have access to them, the enormous fluctuations in price that we see from single buy or sell orders will become far less influential, and the price movement will become far more granular. The more people using the currency, the higher the value and the more stable the market will be. This is the strength of networks and decentralised markets, the bigger they get, the more stable and robust they become.

"You need to do more research. It is evident that there are foundational aspects of the protocol that you are either unaware of or don't understand.

For one, you can't create new Bitcoins either. You can mine them but once all 21 million of them are out they are out. It is estimated that by 2140 all Bitcoins will be mined. This is one of the most important aspects of the protocol. This was one of several ways in which Bitcoin was modeled after precious metals. It is designed to be a kind of digital gold, hence why people often refer to it as such.

And secondly, you don't need a trusted broker for Bitcoin to have value at all. It is a ""trustless"" system, that is the whole reason why blockchain technology is so groundbreaking. Everyone has a copy of the ledger so no one needs to trust a single entity/organisation/third-party. There is no need to trust when you can just verify against the public ledger that you and everyone else has a copy of. This is the foundation of blockchain technology. Saying ""Being your own bank is fine and dandy if everyone trusted you but that's simply not the case"" sounds ridiculous when talking about blockchain technology. That's like saying in reference to the internet ""Being your own library is fine and dandy if you had stacks and stacks of paper to print all the books on.""

Right now the incentive for miners is both this block reward and the fees they collect from users making transactions. Two separate things. Once all the bitcoins have been mined, there will only be the incentive of collecting fees.

"Yea I agree with those thoughts somewhat when it's about your house or debts and such things. What I mean about the cliche beeing flawed is that it does not fit into the term investing. Having an asset or a portfolio with 100% down risk is pure gambling. Many handle cryptos as gamble hoping to hit the moon and therefore have to risk it all but still calls it investing. For me it's about retirement savings and Im absolutely not willing to lose it so I hope to manage risk properly by diversifying and holding cash sometimes. 

For example say if I would ask a manager for a stock market investing fund ""are you ready to lose it all?"" he would probably shake his head and say ""uhm no, I diversify buying over ten different assets and increase my cash position when the market turns down so there's absolutely no risk that I will lose it all"". And he also would be fired if it was confirmed by the risk management team that he was risking it all.

It's just that people write this flawed cliche all the time in investing forums. Investing is about expected returns, not about 100% down risks.";2;0;False;Anothereth;dob95cd;BTC Breaks $5000;75vjl0;https://rollercoasterguy.github.io/

"So funny. Maybe you're a young kid or ignorant of both. You have no idea how ridiculous you sound.  I'll copy paste some of my points for Bitcoin for ya. I'll add some flair as well :)

#1.  This is the EXACT same thing people said about the internet in 1994.  Wow!  Computers connecting  I can chat with other people!  Who cares.  

You have no idea the kinds of applications and amazing advancements will be made using Bitcoin and Blockchain technology. Yes it's early but that's the entire point. Get in now is good.   

#2.  You think the big banks and the Fed are and ideal way to run society?  Do you have a moral compass?  Do you read or understand anything about what happened in 2007 ?  Any idea what happened in Greece and Cyprus when ATM machines overnight failed?  Any idea what happened a couple weeks ago when all of Puerto Rico had no banking and no ATMs. Cash only but couldn't get any.  You think Bitcoin may have been useful then?

Just like we were able to avoid censorship with the internet and gain free speech freedom, we'll do the same with Bitcoin and gain financial freedom.  

Cash will go away.  I for one don't want the government to be able to freeze my funds or tell me what I can or can't do with my money.  Believe they can with venmo, PayPal and your bank.  

#3.  I don't go to the galleria subreddit and talk about how art is a waste of money. I may believe that but if they're into then bless them. Love art. I don't.  

I'm not the kind of person that wants to control others and impose my will on them.  I love Bitcoin. Why do you care?  How is that funny to you?   You think it makes you a better person because you're ignorant on this issue?  

It's like the moron in class when he gets asks by the teacher for an answer and he does know so he says ""I don't know that!"" And smiles and every one laughs.  You're being that idiot.

Its completely sensible. If some dollars were made of gold and others were made of paper would you spend the gold ones and keep the paper and say ""its wrong to think of gold dollars as an investment""?

You just said people shouldn't be thinking they shouldn't spend bitcoins since they'll be worth more later, which implies you do actually have an opinion on how you perceive it.

How bitcoin is perceived is entirely relevant to how much its worth. Is it a currency or is it a speculative asset? Right not the vast majority of people are using it as a speculative asset, not a currency, even though those same people claim the reason its valuable is because its a great new currency that's going to revolutionize the financial system.

That strongly indicates unrealistic bubble thinking, especially from the people who think it will indefinitely increase in value at the current rate which is literally impossible.

Because we are in that situation *right now*, aren't we? What if that is it. $6k. So according to you, if it flatlined now (the insane upwards trend stopped), then the speculative investors would say ""this is it"" and cash out.

1. Then there are a lot of people just waiting for a situation like a month ago to invest heavily again. People are looking for a crash just to buy *right now*.

'I did' is not a percentage. your use of past tense is also conspicuous.

You can find out the rough percentage if you like by googling the ratio of market cap to daily transactions. You might not like what you find though.

If 2 years ago you had $50 in dollars and $50 in bitcoin, why would you pay in the currency that is now worth hundreds of dollars rather than the currency that is now worth less than $50?

There is no difference other than the opportunity cost of hundreds of dollars you're standing to lose or gain.

Bitcoins are deflationary and dollars are inflationary.

In 2 years 50 dollars in dollars will be worth less than what its worth now. There is no incentive to save in dollars. This is what keeps the velocity of dollars high because no one wants to hold onto large amounts of dollars for long, they want to spend it on things or invest in things that won't decrease in value. This makes it a useful currency because if you have shit you want to sell you will always find people who want to swap dollars for it.

People also like dollars because when you get debt in dollars the value of debt decreases over time. If you got a $200,000 mortgage in bitcoins 2 years ago you would be financially ruined by now, there's no way you could ever repay the mortgage.";2;1;False;suninabox;dob7mn0;If Bitcoin hits $100K, I think I care less about being rich than I do about rubbing it in everyones face that kept calling it a scam.;72rzhc;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/72rzhc/if_bitcoin_hits_100k_i_think_i_care_less_about/

Except its not flatlined though?

The price has gone up a thousand dollars in the last week. That's an incredible level of volatility. Why would anyone assume its suddenly hit a perfectly stable equilibrium and no longer increase or decrease in value. It might go up another thousands in another week, why would anyone who is convinced bitcoin will be worth 100K decide to sell now?

People are far more likely to buy in during such boom times rather than sell, which further increases demand which further increases gains in price which increases its attractiveness as a get rich quick scheme.

>The situation you are describing, we are in it. 

You misunderstood what I was describing then. I was not describing a situation where bitcoin suddenly hits an arbitrary price point and everyone decides its no longer going to increase in value for no reason.

Something actually needs to destroy confidence in the potential for increases in value for speculators to want to leave. One of these can be a sustained period of low or no growth, which is what some bitcoin proponents think will happen. I don't think bitcoin price will ever level out, I was simply addressing the claim that somehow an asset that most people have bought to speculate on can hit equilibrium and not lose all those speculators to other assets.

Other things that could destroy confidence is another cryptocurrency surging in popularity whilst bitcoins popularity stalls or falls.

Bitcoin was designed to be deflationary so it can't ever level out, it will keep increasing in value until further growth is impossible and then it will crash.

The Soviet Union was dissolved on December 26, 1991. It was a result of the declaration number 142-Н of the Soviet of the Republics of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. The declaration acknowledged the independence of the former Soviet republics and created the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), although five of the signatories ratified it much later or did not do so at all. On the previous day, Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, the eighth and final leader of the Soviet Union, resigned, declared his office extinct, and handed over its powers – including control of the Soviet nuclear missile launching codes – to Russian President Boris Yeltsin.

What wealth does a war bring to a country? Nothing: all that happens is you spend money and lives.

Inflation (of the money-printing variety) is the Federal reserve stealing wealth from the entire population and spending it to issue defunct loans, such as those to the government.

">WWII didn't grow the American economy, the end of the new deal did

Do you even understand what the broken window argument is? The argument is that *all* government spending harms the economy because it somehow crowds out private spending. Either way, whether you think the war or the new deal was responsible for the recovery, either situation proves the broken window argument wrong. If the broken window argument had merit, both the new deal AND WWII should have been bad for our economy. 

And yes, thats exactly what I'm saying regarding keynesianism. Talking about things in terms of keyunesianism vs austrianism or in terms of any other schools of economics is out of date precisely because we are all keynesians in some ways and none of us are in other ways. And again, that is because modern economics has incorporated the good ideas and tossed the bad ideas from all the old schools.";1;1;False;ja734;doampps;I always carry around a 10 Trillion dollar bill, it reminds me, what happens when our banks f**k up.;75r3fz;https://i.redd.it/wt8baig4w8rz.jpg

It would seem that way. Except it never is in practice. The poor in Zimbabwe are certainly worse off due to inflation.

"Your bribery excuse is clear misdirection. India's economy was struggling and faced great turmoil. The ""bribery"" excuse was just the justification to exert ungodly power of the populous and the excuse doesn't even hold up.
Loads of bribes are given in forms of jewellery or food.
And yet they didn't delegitimise jewellery or food - couldn't if they wanted to tho
Loads of bribe money was used to buy good or was invested in stocks or bank accounts. 
And they didn't delegitimise stocks or bank accounts - and they could if they wanted to. 

And now that this clearly untrue ""bribery"" excuse has been made, what's to stop bribes being made through several low denomination notes? The excuse is a paltry attempt at a blatant coverup.

Your patriotism is misguided. 
There's no point defending central banks, fiat and the governments that wield that power. ";1;1;False;PlatoTheGreato;dob8kws;I always carry around a 10 Trillion dollar bill, it reminds me, what happens when our banks f**k up.;75r3fz;https://i.redd.it/wt8baig4w8rz.jpg

"Bitcoin is a way out of a great deal of duress for third world citizens:
Access to your money whenever you like.
Access to your money wherever you like.
Remittance tax is removed.
Remittance fees are drastically reduced.
Your money is immune to inflation.
Should you need to leave the country your money is easy to carry, store, hide and access.
Your money is free from the clutches of Govt.

In South Africa tax on money leaving the nation is 80% - that's not what their law says but it's what it imposed.
In Greece and Cyprus the government, banks and other institutions can seize funds from your bank without your permission.
In Greece you can only withdraw a nominal amount each day from your account. 
In Mozambique, Colombia, Venezuela and other nations that faced civil war large swathes of citizens had to 24hrs to leave thus abandoning their accounts.
In Mozambique and other places, the banks were seized and patrons lost all claim to their money.

All fiat systems have the power to do what any of these nations did. 

Honestly, stop clinging to your predatory and exploitative institutions. 

Income inequality is an economic fault not a financial one - hence you had economic inequality in bartering times and in gold's time. The third world is systemically oppressed by financial institutions and the like through the fiat system.

"I understand your plight, I totally support bitcoin in that respect. But lets not give examples of, fake economic collapse to Bitcoin's advantage. This might seem against popular opinion and even another in context of US but hear me out. 
The move made was to weed out money with individuals stored in form of cash earned through illegitimate sources like bribes, which is a major problem in India. With fiat, it could be done while in case of gold or Bitcoin, not so much. How do you think wealth distribution problem will pan out with Bitcoin? Bitcoin is placed with a handful of individuals in international context and it's being distributed into others. Don't you think it is a huge, first moved based, problem where, the poor people in third world countries, suffer? With bitcoin, we're probably only moving from one set of problems to other.

"Sigh.

If you held those notes and weren't able to change them in time (as many people couldn't) then you lost your wealth thanks to an action of the govt.

This control is granted exclusively by fiat money.

Even under the Gold Standard the govt could try decommission notes but it wouldn't matter because that note still had a gold value and as such would be traded regardless.

I never said that India's economy collapsed, I said don't think that what happened in India was a once off that couldn't happen again. 
The government dispossessed thousands of people by using their monopoly on the control of money to nullify their citizens' wealth.

"That article jumps to extreme conclusions based on flimsy assumptions. There's no proof that it was satoshi and in fact the blocks that we do have proof of being Satoshi's (where he pays hall Finney) do NOT match the pattern. Did satoshi deliberately create that pattern and then pick an off block just to create plausible deniability?

Also the block times were often much much longer than 10 minutes around that time, indicating nobody was mining at all and this certainly not satoshi trying to maximize his own block rewards.

He also clearly never have himself the opportunity to premine by putting a news paper header in the genesis block.

In short there is no proof that he did mine that much and there is in fact plausible deniability as well as evidence of him doing his best to be fair.";1;0;False;coinjaf;doai49s;Satoshi Nakamoto At a Blockchain conference in Santa Monica today.;75j79e;https://i.redd.it/elklu91it1rz.jpg
