But you have made a decent point here, as the buyer has no choice but to buy in at a higher price if the expected future value makes it worth it, while the potential seller has no reason to sell without knowing about a drop.

Greed. 

When you enter a volatile market, you understand that there will be ups and downs, but that your overall goal is to come out ahead. Focusing on price highs with 20/20 hindsight is at least an irresponsible, if not a downright stupid, position to take when investing.

> Crypto is in a lot of trouble.

Maybe for someone who got in a couple months ago, cares about nothing but the price, and expects to leave soon. For anyone else, this is factually wrong; the market is orders of magnitude larger than it was 1 year ago and since any time before that too, and the technology has matured tremendously, and can compete more than ever with traditional currencies.

> It’s time for people to be realists and accept discussion on negative trends instead of labelling it as FUD and dismissing it.

What is there to discuss other than volatility? Nothing new there, other than to say that volatility has been decreasing overall. A large factor here is of course market size. Small markets are vulnerable to volatility.

As always, in a bear market, the best thing to do is to take the time to research and reevaluate your position: ask yourself why you are in this market.

Nope. I've been in Bitcoin since 2012 and I simply learned that I'm really *really* bad at trading. I guarantee you, if I had sold at $15k, I somehow would have managed to lose money. Riding out dips is for most, like 99.99% of the people, the more profitable option. The memes are just a bonus.

"The answer to this question always depends on ""what kind of regulations"" and ""on who""?

Bitcoin is somewhat regulation-resistant; BTC-BTC transfers are traceable via the public ledger but not directly linked to a person.

It's similar in difficulty to cash in some ways.  The tech for ATMs to scan the serial numbers of all cash they take in and hand out, for example, could be deployed in probably a year or two, if it's not being done already.

Exchanges are somewhat centralized by their nature, and act as a big data store of account information.  That data, along with acts of transferring fiat and crypto, is an obvious target for regulators.

As /u/joyofpeanuts says, this is likely to help acceptance in the mainstream, but I think, like cash, there will continue to be ways to skirt this regulation if you are inclined to do so.";0;0;False;ryani;dvvvbqn;Mood Currently.;858n7c;https://v.redd.it/mo6a9ysnpfm01

"**Hindsight bias**

Hindsight bias, also known as the knew-it-all-along effect or creeping determinism, is the inclination, after an event has occurred, to see the event as having been predictable, despite there having been little or no objective basis for predicting it. It is a multifaceted phenomenon that can affect different stages of designs, processes, contexts, and situations. Hindsight bias may cause memory distortion, where the recollection and reconstruction of content can lead to false theoretical outcomes. It has been suggested that the effect can cause extreme methodological problems while trying to analyze, understand, and interpret results in experimental studies.

Bitcoin vets would have learned from MtGox 2013 and sold around at least a good chunk of  coins between 15 000 and 20 000 either after 15 000 and before the 20 000 or before it went down below 15 000 again. When MtGox started buying up coins to pay back customers their coins the price went from 200 to 1000 in a very short time. If your objective is to get as many Bitcoin as possible, it's very rational to sell at high points and buy back more at low points. Bitcoin will always have value and the target is like a million per coin or some but there is really no law saying it will never drop back down below a certain point. Getting to that million point can take 20 years because crazy unexpected stuff can happen in the future that nobody ever thought was possible. You know like bcash taking over or something.

📊Lowest Volume Since Nov📊

When evaluating the 1 yr log uptrend (the one that broke last week) we were looking at the candle closes - as opposed to the wicks. It's not necessarily right or wrong, it's a matter of preference; as long as you’re consistent. That means you shouldn’t connect wicks to candles and visa versa. 

We used the candle close because the wick from hitting the $6k bottom was a capitulation point and the bounce was massive. We figured if we dropped below that trendline it'd be a great short opportunity, and boy were we right. There’s been 13% downside since that trendline broke. Another profitable short.

With all that said, if we use the wicks to draw the uptrend, you'll see that we're now right on it - technically the 1yr uptrend is still intact, though we’ve been in a downtrend the last 91 days...but who’s counting 🤷‍♂️

Today Bitcoin saw the least amount of volume it’s seen since late November. It’s about half of the volume average of the last 30 days. The last time volume was this low, the BTC price (and therefore marketcap) were almost exactly the same.

If we bounce off this uptrend and find consistency at this level of volume, we could finally be in for some consolidation - some sideways price action.

>	Let’s say you go into a casino with the intention of gambling $2 million, and you wind up doubling your stake. Chances are you are going to value the newly-gained $2 million very differently from the original $2 million you earned through hard work. Most people will consider such a windfall to be the “house’s money,” says Calabrese, rather than their own money. “We often put labels on money, so not every dollar is treated the same way,” he says.

>The danger here is you are likely to take on greater risk with the windfall—increasing the odds that you are going to make a bad financial decision with the money.

Anyone with half a brain would have cashed out when this shit peaked at the end of 2017. I don't care how high it might go in the future, cashing out with an investment that nets 1800% profit is a once in a lifetime opportunity for the vast majority of people. Even more so if you bought in at the beginning. I don't understand how high every HODL investor thinks BTC will bounce back to. It's the most unstable commodity I have ever seen in my life. And yes, at this point BTC is a speculated commodity. Use as a currency alternative is never going to happen unless it's regulated. At some point the bubble will burst and prices will plummet. I don't have a dog in the fight so good luck to everyone holding. Just don't overextended yourself because you think you'll get rich.

"Why is this guy downvoted? Is it his presentation? Or is it that he's spamming this comment? Or is it that it's pretty off-topic? 

I recently recommended a bunch of documentaries that make the same point in another thread on this sub and it is my most upvoted comment ever. But to be fair, it was on-topic and wasn't just a bunch of headlines cropped for imgur.


Edit: probably the spammy nature and lack of saying anything useful based on most of the comments. I was thrown off by the one upvoted tinfoil hat comment.

">faster transaction confirmations

No technology can give you faster on-chain transaction confirmations while preserving the security properties of Bitcoin. It's going to be 10 minutes on average for each additional confirmation. You could use an altcoin with faster block cadences, but that doesn't actually change your assurance that a confirmed transaction is final: think of it in terms of electricity burned (which is what confers security) to mine the blocks under which your tx is buried, rather than in terms of the number of blocks (which is quite arbitrary).

>nearly free during day to day use

On-chain tx fees seem to be hovering around 5 satoshi/byte these days. For a normal, reasonable (i.e. not a sweep of 1000 faucet outputs) transaction that would be something of the order of 5000 satoshi for tx fees. 0.00005 BTC. I think that's as close to ""free"" as you're going to get on any cryptocurrency that more than a handful of fanboys actually use.";1;0;False;bpj1805;dvv9k64;After countless late nights, lines of code, bug fixes, and memes...
