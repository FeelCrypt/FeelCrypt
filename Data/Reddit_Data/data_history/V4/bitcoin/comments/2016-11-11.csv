"haha /u/soberasfuck deletes all his comments when he loses debate.  What a fag.

I had high expectations for you.  As the mod of /r/fattv, i thought we could be pals ripping on people but you were all sensitive and defensive when it came to trannies.  Sad.";1;1;False;ellenpaosanus;d9ve5bl;Excuse me?;5bhru0;https://i.imgur.com/eXh8daN.jpg
"> Plus fat people can lose weight

You cant say youve never heard a fat person all like ""muh thyroid""

transgender people can present as a masculine female or a effeminate male.  Neither group has a medical condition, but they will  both whine and cry and blame it all on a ""medical condition"".

">security reasons

You didn't delete your original comment.  You can see what the comments say still with various widgets and you didn't say anything that could be used to identify you in this thread. 

you just deleted the comments where you looked stupid 

Serious question, why should we make fun of fat people but be nice to transsexuals?.  Shouldn't we laugh at em both for the same reason (they look funny / are freaks)";1;1;False;ellenpaosanus;d9vgwao;Excuse me?;5bhru0;https://i.imgur.com/eXh8daN.jpg
"It doesnt really effect my life, fat people or transgender people.  Its probably the attention seeking behavior and victim mentality in both situations that makes me dislike them.  And its not even that i dislike them on an individual level, its the insistence that i accept them as beautiful as they are in the case of fat people or the gender they are pending to be when it comes to transsexuals.  That aspect of it is hilarious to me.

Isn't the flip side to that no one would want to be fat unless they really were sick because it would suck being a lard ass.  Fat people put up with a ton of shit too.  Changing gender and becoming fat are alike in that its not an instant process in either case.  They start normal and after a long time of doing weird shit to their body, the look weird as fuck at the end.";1;0;False;ellenpaosanus;d9vi5xp;Excuse me?;5bhru0;https://i.imgur.com/eXh8daN.jpg
