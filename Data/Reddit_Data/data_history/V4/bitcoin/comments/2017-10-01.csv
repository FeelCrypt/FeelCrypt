"First person there gets the most business, reputation, and opportunity to lead the way. If your company always innovates and keeps pushing the envelope, people will want to work for you. You get passionate people, you get the best workers.

No one will be able to reasonably compete if you're leading the way at every step. Think Google back in the early 2000s. They rode the internet to becoming the 2nd biggest company in the world, in a matter of 3 decades.

I assume an entire nation could accelerate this process, making their people the leaders in digital space, finance, security, and innovation. They will highly impact the economy and be a superpower just because everyone turns to them for guidance on what to do next.

"You are free to download and develop a game with unity and unreal engines but you must pay a license or fee as soon a you start selling copies of a game. Also only specific tools in Unity are open source, the engine itself is not. Unreal engines source code is available to developers to extend or modify but is also not open source. Both companies still expect you to compensate them if you are making money with their technology. They are just trying to attract more indie developers to their engines because casual hipster indie games have been en vogue for the last few years for some reason.

I'm very familiar with open source, MIT license, etc. I spent several years in college studying software engineering. You don't have to preach it to me. Yes I've 'tried' Linux, it is in no way a replacement for the convenience of Windows and or OS X. 

The difference between us it seems; Is I believe in a free market and I do believe in fundamental IP rights. I do admit that lobbying has lead to overreach in areas of IP law, but that is no reason to throw the baby out with the bath water. I think if people want to charge per copy for the digital goods then they should have the right to do that. And I think if you want it then you need to respect the way they do business or find a different product. Kind of like picking out a restaurant. Unfortunately patent trolls try to stifle competitors but luckily in the software world patent infringements are pretty rare unless you literally Ctrl+C Ctrl+V the code. I appreciate you idealism but you seem to have very black and white thinking on the matter

I don't agree that open source software is inherently better. It can be. But I think there is a handful of examples that are, and shit tons of open source programs that are far worse than commercial programs. Have you seen the annals of Git? It almost doesn't even warrant argument. As far as spying in Windows and Mac, egghhh. Spying is kind of dramatic for ad targeting. It's been a big deal lately I get it, but if Linux was really better Windows and Mac wouldn't still be pushing such good profit margins right now. Linux simply isn't for everyone.

"Look, I understand how you may think that information property is similar to physical property. It's true that cryptography can protect certain information and passwords control access to systems, but those things are **inherently protectable.** 

I know you made a metaphor to an unlocked house yet that really is apples to oranges. An unlocked house would be like a system without a password, which admittedly is not a very nice thing to do to another person or system owner. Walking into that house would be a violation of property rights, which most people agree with (except commies) and taking a physical object would mean that owner of that object loses it. 

Firstly most people agree with property rights, and aspire to buy a piece of property themselves. It is a natural and organic law which we are conditioned to understand and utilize. Communists don't actually agree with physical property but that is why it is nothing more than an agreement among people. It is mutually beneficial for everyone to respect each other's physical property. 

Personal space is actually a more natural ""law"" but also just basic human behavior. The thing though is that almost everyone agrees with physical property rights because it benefits everyone and because **physical matter is a finite resource.** Information is copiable.. 

**If I say a string of words then you copy me and repeat those words then I am at no loss.** This is because there is no penalty for creating information the same with that there is with physical matter and information is not finite like land. Now you would probably counter by saying that if i was using those words like in a song or something to make money then if you copied me that would be infringing upon my right to make money from my information.

 But there is no intrinsic right to make money from labor. There is only value in something which has demand and because information is copiable that means that you can only make money from information in particular ways and there are other variable like a singer's voice which make information valuable or not. 

Information is much much much more abstract than other laws and phsyical property and **it's not mutally beneficial for the general population to agree to information rights.** In fact in Finland there is a pirate party which seeks to get rid of information property and provides resources to users which get penalized for torrenting. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirate_Party

Information property ""rights"" has other distinct negatives for society and the individual. Patents were meant to incentivize innovation and make being an inventor a viable career but now we see them being used as way for frivolous lawsuits to target individuals or business owners ie patent trolls. The problem is that certain things have been patented which would be analogous to copyrighting the word ""the."" Such as UI elements like a menu on a website.

It's worse though because patenting in general slows down innovation and because something which is patented may have been thought of before. There are companies which try to patent as much stuff as possible and then make money by suing people later for actually producing things. Can you imagine an artist just patenting as many things as he can draw? That is the current state of the law and a prototype is not even needed for a patent to be awarded.

But even ""legitimate"" patents have negative implications. Like I said before, people often think of things yet dont patent them, and there are very basic elements of technology which are like building blocks to other technology, like the word ""the,"" which are currently patentable. Right now it's impossible to build your own version of google glasses because they own all the patents to that yet all good science fiction movies show people with different kinds of information visors walking around. That's simple not fair!

And it gets worse. Airplane manufacturers patent as much shit as they can which means that engineers often build airplanes with elements, like a door or a valve or control surface actuator, which are not the best design for the job. There are established designs already which have been refined yet the engineers have to come up with compromised solutions just to be different and get around patent laws.

Then there is patenting biology, creepy! We are all in possession of biological technology because our bodies have the necessary building blocks and the only reason that companies are allowed to do these things is because of crony capitalism.

So, you can see now that it's not ethical or in the general public's self interest to agree to information property laws anymore. The only reason that they are still around is because of corrupt government officials and massive lobbying from centralized corporate power. It is now our responsibility to resist information property laws as much as possible, yet people like you who allow yourself to be turned into useful brainwashed idiots hampers that effort.

Finally you are wrong when it comes to information property laws benefiting most content producers! The massive communications and information sharing networks today mean there is less of a barrier to entree for content producers and developers. It also means that we have to better than our predecessors but that's okay because it's easy to make money for an individual content producer still and it just takes a little bit of effort. 

You are **incredibly** naive to think the only way content producers ""remain viable"" is too survive by selling individual copies! **Information sharing has drastically lowered the barrier of entry for content creators.** The old way may have benefited centralized corporations but the current state of things benefits the individual and they are only limited by their creativity in coming up with revenue models.

The optimal model for a content producer would be that people **pay as much as they can.** Content producers actually still benefit from people viewing their content That's why the solution to the problem of content is not **brutal violent authoritarianism which throws users in cages.** The solution is a cultural shift towards taking care of content producers so that they produce the content you want.

If tomorrow steam went away and the video game industry had no more revenue for individual copies people would just donate more!

Furthermore, **content producers still benefit from the popularity of their content even if not all of the consumers pay for their copy of the content.** There is inherent value in being able to captivate the attention of a large audience and advertising has been the traditional revenue stream for this. **And that is why the most successful content producers sell physical products as well as produce content.** 

**Notice how both Joe Rogan and Alex Jones sell their listeners vitamin supplements and also things like workout equipment and water filters!!** Both these people have net worths over 20 million. They would make farrrrrrrr less money if they sold individual copies of their broadcasts. 

And I understand that things like video games or movies are harder to make than a podcast or radio show but it's possible release smaller video games in episodes and also video games are actual applications where you can manipulate the users experience more directly. Cryptography can also be used in video games, and I think you will see more advanced anti pirating techniques.

 Although I am sure that the content producers which at least offer some free content will make more money than the ones who expect cash for every copy. Although admittedly right now its very easy to make money with steam but many people think that videogames are in a bubble and soon video game developers are going to have to get more creative in their sources of revenue.

Youre wrong as well about open source developers! Most open sourcers make decent money but it's just not from selling copies of their software directly. The trick is that they have a mutually beneficial relationship with the consumers of their software so that the more free software that is produced means that more free software is produced. 

Do you know any open source developers in real life? I know some and they make money by selling companies websites and then they work on the open source tools with their spare time. There are also crowd funding options for them. **But most open source devs are content producers who make money off their content but work together in order to produce open source tools for EACH OTHER!** That is, they all benift mutually from taking part in an ecosystem which provides tools and software to make more content. This is a positive *feedback loop!*

The bottom line is that content or software producers which expect money for individual copies of their information **are incredibly lazy** and are not creative enough to think of ways to profit from the attention their content or software is getting. Their revenue is only limited by their imagination and people who expect money for copies of information are incredibly dim witted and that is why they make inferior products, and that's part of the reason why Hollywood has such shitty movies.

Windows and Apple are objectively worse than Linux and that is because **the goal of the Apple and Microsoft is to extort the user. They feature such qualities as planned obsolescence and spy ware.** **A decentralized mutually beneficial relationship with the user is far more robust produces a better product every time.** The problem is that corporations do not like this and they benefit from relationships with politicians, ie crony capitalism.

Torvalds also has far more money than celebrity net worth thinks he does, because that number was before Android came out. Also many members of the ""Free Software Foundation"" profit from donations and such and open source. Also I have copyrighted this piece of writing so do not copy it!

">Yes I've 'tried' Linux, it is in no way a replacement for the convenience of Windows and or OS X.

You obviously did not try hard enough! What distro did you try and did you make *any* effort to learn how to use the terminal? You spent literally years learning to read and write at some point. Would it kill you to spend a couple months becoming familiar with computers? 

Linus is *objectively* better and in fact easier to use. The problem though is that people cannot be arsed to look up something even for 5 whole minutes. Windows and Apple are literal mazes and become slower over time in an effort to extort the user into buying new hardware. 

Not only is there no excuse for spying on the user and it can be used to black mail users in the future, but it fucking makes the computer slow! Ever wondered why windows takes forever to load and constantly has to install updates and get slower and slower? Ever wonder why Linux uses so little resources and doesn't just randomly start using 2 gigs of ram over the course of a few weeks?

There is no fucking excuse. These are shit fucking products. People are fucking retarded idiots for putting up with this shit. It's like everyone is brainwashed or something but i guess that is the power of bias. 

Look at this UI:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Elv13/radical/master/screenshot/all.png

Apple and Windows could never be customized to that point, and they force the user to use shitty flat or skeuomorphic headache inducing UIs because they're fucking full of shit and the developers only want to blackmail and extort their users. Where is the cyberpunk UIs promised us in movies and anime? Only on Linux! There is nothing which is easier to do on windows or Linux unless it has to do with some piece of proprietary software or spying on users. 

And the only reason that people think Windows is easier is because they are scared of the terminal interface, yet they learned how to read and write and cannot be arsed to even spend 1/100th of the effort when it comes to their computer. And I mean everything because I have dealt with windows server and there are corportate solutions that are very robust in Linux. 

**People do not have a right to control eachothers thoughts or arranging ones and zeroes.** Cryptography is very specific but even protecting cryptography with laws is dangerous and can lead to abuses of power. There are in fact very robust profit models available to developers and content creators which allow their customers to freely share their content. There is no need for brutally throwing people in cages for thought crimes anymore and therefore it needs to be taken off the fucking books! 

The founding fathers made all kinds of compromises but they **always** erred on the side of freedom. Benjamin Franklin famously said **"" “Those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety.”** Our society has been cucked! People have been conditioned to err on the side of authority even when there are perfectly viable solutions which respect freedom! Society isn't going to collapse tomorrow if we forget about IP!

There are very specific and unusual situations where a case for information property might be righteous but this is for things like nuclear power or viral genetic engineering. But even then, relying on a centralized state authority leaves us vulnerable! A much more robust solution would be a decentralized network of trust! I don't have the specifics designed yet but in the future we would be better off using a kind of anonymous circle of trust using cryptography to trust each other on a mass scale while still respecting individual privacy, and it would be much much more robust and less vulnerable to single faults.

And you completely ignored the fact that all possible permutations of characters have already been ""published"" and creators are only finding these patterns. Every computer code exists already, every book, every conversation. It's not ethical anymore for individuals to be able to claim ownership of these abstractions anymore! And there is no need! 

Imagine when 3D printers become more robust and useful! Can you imagine how corporations are going to cramp down on people using IP laws? When 3D printers get better we could transition into a true *post scarcity* world yet I guarantee it will be the authoritarians and the corporations which stand in the way! 

Please, for the love of god, do not be a useful idiot for these people! You already disobey the laws... they're useless and ineffective just as much as telling people to not use drugs or gamble or engage in prostitution! You already use bitcoin! You already have the spirit of freedom yet some part of your ego clings on to your own enslavement!

"Look I know I may not convince you on this topic but it's something that I am required to organize my thoughts on anyway. 

Property rights are organic in human behavior, especially in the western world. If you were living in a tribe and fashioned yourself a stone tool would it be natural for another tribesmen to get to walk up and grab it from you right away? If you were laying in your hut with your girl do you think it would naturally okay for another tribesmen to barge in without permission and lay next to your woman?

Also information sharing does not destroy the original copy. **If someone scanned one of your possessions and used a 3D printer to print one out for themselves would you really mind?** These type of laws are going to be used in the future to try and keep individuals from gaining decentralized power relative to corporations and politicians! 

These laws **do not benefit** the general population and **only benefit content creators to lazy and stubborn to seek alternate revenue streams.** Meanwhile these lazy content creators benefit from the increased communication and information sharing which the internet allows. **Also content producers are at zero loss, and in fact benefit when somebody experiences their content for free who would not have paid if they only had the option to pay for it!**

There are example after example of content producers who are independently wealthy and give away free content. It is not out of reach to anyone and the content creators who are just starting out are in a better place than ever with platforms like kickstarter and patreon. 

The video game industry doesnt like ads but **they embrace crowd funding and pre sales.** If steam disappeared and video game quality went down then more gamers would be motivated to participate in pre sale and crowd funding. We are currently experiencing a cultural shift which places more value on supporting content creators **directly.** And talented content producers will never be out of work specifically thanks to the interconnectedness offered by the internet. 

Furthermore games are complicated pieces of software which can incorporate cryptography to naturally protect their content. And you cited that game engines are expensive to create but **the most successful game engines (unreal and unity) are open source and freely distributed.** 

You say that the open source and free software models are not going to replace the tradional model anytime soon yet you are wrong because *it already has.* You, yourself, even admit to torrenting constantly, but you also justify your actions because you are not wealthy enough, and a large portion of the general public does not pay for content either and many refuse to pay even if they can afford it and only support content producers directly who are outspoken against information property.

And open-source/free software already TRUMPS proprietary content in both quality and respecting the user's rights. 
If you have not tried Linux yet you really owe it to yourself because it is much better in terms of quality than the legacy OSes. The traditional command prompt scares many users away but as someone who is forced to deal with windows servers from time to time I can vouch that for complicated system administration, it trumps navigating through a maze of clickable boxes. Advanced system features become as easy as ""copy and paste"" to implement with the command prompt.

Furthermore the free software that is available for linux is organized into repositories with package maintainers that insure that the software is maintained properly for the operating system. And in general most of the software that is meant for development is much better in overall quality because it's made by a community of developers for other developers. Free software also respects the users rights because it's not motivated to spy on or extort the user. In fact the whole motivation behind free software is to empower the community of users. 

Operating systems like windows and iOS literally spy on the user and anyone with half a brain would not touch them with a ten foot pole. The only exception is phones and gaming. The former is only true because of obscene regulations and crony capitalism and the latter is only true because many gamers are immature and do not understand that they are enabling unethical practices by purchasing games. 

I implore you as an individual to read through the free software foundations literature on the benefits of free software. They are not all communists and many of them are even bitcoiners who wish to empower individuals to become independently wealthy like they are! https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/shouldbefree.en.html

Overall we need to strive to live in as free a society as possible and to empower individuals instead of corporations and politicians. We cannot do this if we give them the legal power to prosecute us for sharing information. Arranging 1s and 0s into patterns does not entitle you to profit. Only the demand of your efforts will reward you with anything and that is dictated by the laws of computing.

You said that authors are entitled to the rights to publish their work. But you are neglecting the fact that every book ever written and will ever be written has already been published. **The following is a link to the ""Library of Babel"" which is a an algorithm which has arranged all the characters in the alphabet into every possible combination:

You see, when we are creating something we are not actually creating anything at all. In fact we are only *finding* the answer to a question. Creation can be more accurately thought of as subtractive synthesis. Information already exists as white noise and our brains have evolved to filter in or tune into certain frequencies of thought or understanding. Ever heard of the concept of *the muse?*

Have you ever done psychedelics? When we create something we are only trapping ideas into physical manifestations. It is not fair or just to regulate this process and those who wish to do that are only feeding into a nefarious, fearful, and greedy mind virus which wishes to control humanity. When people seek to make laws which regulate our thoughts and the information which we access or copy they are literally making a deal with **satan.**

"Firstly I thank you for such a detailed response. 

 You argued that rights to physical property are inherently organic in nature. I think ownership of a house, car, etc. Is just as abstract as the idea of IP rights. The car is not part of me or an extension of my being. It is simply a car. and there is just a general agreement that I paid for it, ergo its mine. But that ""ownership"" is extremely abstract, except for of course legally.

 I won't argue that IP rights have over stepped what I consider fair, but I still think they are extremely valuable to people who create content, software, music etc. I also think that everyone should have a right to pursue which ever business model for their IP they want and though I'm sure open source has its pro's its simply not going to replace the traditional license/copy model in our lifetimes probably. Really selling copies of a digital song is no different than an author being entitled to the sole rights to publish and sell his book. This idea 

 On the case of video games, this is probably the least likely to go 'opensource'. The gaming community has shown a general disgust and hatred for micro-transactions and ad revenue for free to play games. The games that use this model are usually targeted at the mobile market because it takes much longer to recoup your investment and mobile games are much easier and quicker to develop than say a modern first-person shooter for game consoles or PC. The gaming industry shows no signs of slowing down in terms of investment on a single title. Most players want to play games on the cutting edge of engine/hardware technology and a free-to-play model with ads or micro-transactions is a stupid bet for any producers to dump several hundred million into the project. Some Game studios spend 5-8 years just developing a game engine for future games which can be several million in of itself. 

Really this is all just a matter of opinion. I thank you for sharing yours";1;1;False;Swimmingbird3;dnqzko7;Kim Dotcom: No Government can stop the rise of crypto now. Bankers begin to panic.
