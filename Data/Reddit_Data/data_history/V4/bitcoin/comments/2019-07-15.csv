Believe it or not, “No one ever went broke taking profits” is misleading and bad advice. This is because people tend to sell profits early and ride our losses hoping for a recovery.

"If Bitcoin gets mass adopted then yes a 21 trillion dollar market cap is possible. But there are several factors to be considered. 

First, we most likely won't get there within the next bull cycle. Bitcoin made a 20x from its past high of about 1k in 2013 to 20k in 2017. As Bitcoin gets bigger the potential of percentage growth gets smaller. So Bitcoin doing a 50x jump (20k to 1 million) in this bull cycle is very unlikely. So we are looking at a longer time frame, anywhere between 4 to 20 years. 

This brings us to the second point. We are assuming that Bitcoin stays the leader in the cryptomarket. While there is a lot that supports this idea, we can't possibly know for sure. We are looking at a long time frame and therefore it is pretty much unpredictable. Just because something is currently leading the market does not mean it will stay like that forever. 

Some examples of market leaders that failed: Nokia could not keep up with the smartphone revolution and therefore lost its market share to Apple/Samsung, Taxi companies around the world are getting replaced by Uber because Uber is more convenient and cheaper than Taxis, Kodak that dominated the photography film market went insolvent as it was left behind by the digitalization of cameras, Yahoo, that was once the leading search engine, got completely replaced by the more innovative search engine Google. Those are only a couple of examples.

Of course, Bitcoin could also stay the market leader, but it is important to always have those possibilities in mind.";13;1;False;UniqueUsername642;etv3cvj;Gave my sister 1 BTC for Christmas in 2013. Got this text yesterday. Warms my heart, so happy for her.;cdkxbx;https://imgur.com/Srj9IBb

"This sub is so over the top with their ""HODL"" shit.

It is completely rational for your sister (who is a normal person and not a bitcoin nerd) to see a 20x ROI on an investment and then want to cash it out.  No one ever went broke taking profits.

Not only that, but she's using those profits to invest into the property value of her house.

If you guys in this sub want to attract people to Bitcoin, you should stop bashing the shit out of everyone who sells theirs for a profit.  ""DUDE IN 5 YEARS IT'S GONNA BE WORTH 500K MOONSHOT DUDE HODL HODL I KNOW THE MEME TOO SEE?!"" is not a rational investment strategy.  

Maybe it's just me but in the last few years this sub has turned into a weird investment cult of everyone jerking each other off fantasizing about what they are going to call their new country when they buy an island with their bitcoin profits, and then trashing anyone who is excited that they made some money in a super volatile investment vehicle.

She's held onto it for 6 years, it's not like she's jumping at the chance to sell it the first time it goes up 3% overnight.

If everyone here is so certain that in 20 years she can buy a house with it, why aren't you guys jumping at the opportunity to buy this BTC from his sister at a decent price?

Most (not all) of the people bashing her for not holding probably own like $500 in bitcoin anyway, and if they actually owned a whole bitcoin, and had the opportunity, they'd be cashing out that $10k in a second, and using the money to buy useless skins on Steam.";8;1;False;Where_You_Want_To_Be;etur4rz;Gave my sister 1 BTC for Christmas in 2013.

I love giving Bitcoin away.  Every time I have I feel great about it...it has done so many things for me I can't help but give back now.  I gave away 0.1 when it represented $10.00 usd, and I commonly give away $5.00 to each employee of the stores I work with that sell Bitcoin.

"That's awesome dude :) Congrats to you both! I'm a brother... Can't afford a whole Bitcoin or pieces atm for my 13 yo brother. So for now every time I visit I bring him 1-2 ozs of silver out of my stack and give it to him. It gets thrown in the safe and that's it unless he wants to oogle them. I imagine the same will happen with my BTC stash when it appreciates.  


Little man will have a free car at 16 or a couple years of college paid for by the time he's there. Even if SILV NEVER went over $15/oz.
