"It is nicely done and it's great that someone took the time to do this... but please please don't use this on a website without making it so it doesn't repeat the animation more than once.  There's nothing worse than trying to use a website or read text on the page while some annoying animation is repeating over and over.  That's a web design no-no and it will drive away many of your potential customers.

Edit:  From reading the author's comments, I don't think he intends it to be used on web pages, but I bet some people are still going to want to use it that way.  If you do use it on a web page, at least turn off the animation looping.";76;2;False;thbt101;cdmfegz;"I was bored so I animated the ""Bitcoin Accepted Here"" image.";1rdyqe;http://i.imgur.com/3onivJa.gif

I used to be a flash animator at an advertising company. The higher-ups sent us off on a training course to learn after effects, so that we can create higher quality material. Eventually i got made redundant from that job and i have been freelancing ever since. The key is to find a substantial project that you can really get your teeth into. I was lucky enough to know a guy who makes Facebook games for a living, and he asked me to create a few videos for one of his new games. Its been great fun! So yeah, there is potential for freelance work, but you might have to expand a little on the services (i offer graphic design too).;1;1;False;imitator22;cdmjbbj;"I was bored so I animated the ""Bitcoin Accepted Here"" image.";1rdyqe;http://i.imgur.com/3onivJa.gif

"Cinema is more for 3d broadcast (as opposed to Maya and full-blown movies, but these days you can use various programs all across the board).

If you wanna learn motion graphics, get a copy of After Effects (not gonna say how), and check out some mograph channels on vimeo, r/motiondesign, r/animation, r/aftereffects, r/vfx, and check out some simple tutorials on schoolofmotion.com, find some lynda tutorials, and most importantly, GIVE YOURSELF A PROJECT, and commit to it. I would rather learn this way than through tutorials (but tutorials will walk you through the interface, which has its learning curve), and as you slog through your project, you will come across challenges that you can then google specifically for how to solve them.

GO FOR IT.

It's a great pursuit and incorporates so many artforms, and motion design is mainly for TV/film/video, but the principles can carry over to videogames and web as well (but you gotta learn entirely different workflows and software).

It's great!

I hope not too many sites end up using that. I hate animations on websites and I frankly think they are a bad design decision - with the obvious exception of sites where the animation itself is the main focus. In all other cases, animations just get on my nerves by constantly diverting my attention from what I came there for in the first place.;1;0;False;waigl;cdmruzg;"I was bored so I animated the ""Bitcoin Accepted Here"" image.";1rdyqe;http://i.imgur.com/3onivJa.gif
