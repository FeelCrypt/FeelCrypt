What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little shit? Ill have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and Ive been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and Im the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. Youre fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and thats just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little clever comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldnt, you didnt, and now youre paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it.

We will shortly be a fully regulated firm, potentially managing several billion within a few years, if we started keeping anyones coins we would be rightfully thrown in prison.

The main advantage our method has over yours is as follows;

If 1,000 redditors follow your instructions over a longer timeline (lets say 30 years), when it matures, only 800 of those redditors might be alive in which case theres a decent chance that 200 pots of bitcoin get lost.

In a tontine, if you are one of the surviving 800 then you now get 25% MORE bitcoin than you started with.

But all of these things would be pretty stupid too.  The less you diversify, the more it becomes high class gambling.  Don't put all your money in BTC if you wouldn't be willing to put it on red.

"Well, I very much suspect this method is outdated now, what with all the fancy new 'programmable money' things that Bitcoin can do these days, but here's how someone *might* do it:


1. On an *online* computer, use a service like `random.org` to generate a small random-char string, about 6 to 8 characters long, e.g. `jw49fw4d` *without reading it!* Let's call this `$randchars`
2. Download a script such as the one at `bitaddress.org`.
3. Transfer that script, and `$randchars` to a separate *offline* computer (using something like a USB drive)
4. On your offline computer, create yourself a long, secure passphrase. e.g. `incorrect donkey power glue` Let's call this `$passphrase` - and back it up somewhere (offline) so you never lose this part!
5. Still on your offline computer, use the 'brainwallet' tab of the bitaddress script to create a bitcoin address/privkey pair from `$passphrase` added to `$randchars`. e.g. if your passphrase was derp and your randchars was 69, then you'd be making a brainwallet from derp69.
6. Transfer your entire life savings into the bitcoin address you just generated.
7. Back on your online computer, use a service such as `futureme.org` to email `$randchars` to yourself at some far off date in the future.
8. Delete all trace of `$randchars` from your own computers.


Some important points:

1. Back up, back up, back up, the `$passphrase` part should never be lost! But don't put that part anywhere near the internet.
2. If you can manage to do the entire process without *actually reading or seeing* `$randchars` so much the better, because you won't have to rely on will power to not access your coins - you shouldn't even know these chars. However, if you're copying/pasting with your eyes half closed, you have to be doubly triply sure that the bitcoin address you generated was definitely from `$passphrase$randchars` and not `$passphrase[some other random crap in your clipboard|null]`
3. The length and chars in `$randchars` is very important. You're trying to aim to make this part bruteforceable (plan B scenario where `futureme.org` fails somehow), but not *easily* bruteforceable (you don't want to be tempted to try to access your coins before the vesting date you chose). I think 8 alphabet chars is good, because it's about 200 billion combinations. So you can't just casually get to it, but the number is low enough that you won't permanently lose your money in a brute-force scenario.
4. Make sure whatever email address you give to `futureme.org` is one that you'll be able to access on the vesting date. I recommend having your own domain for this purpose, as you never know what policies hotmail/gmail/latesthipstermail will cause your account closure.
5. You'll see from this process that because you choose a very secure `$passphrase` and never shared that with anyone, you're the only one that can actually brute-force the brain wallet if it comes to that. So you don't need to worry about futureme staff or any intermediaries intercepting $randchars. The worst they could do is make you access your coins early.

Edit: Aaaaactually, if you're going to go and actually set this up, there's one more thing that I'd recommend doing...

1. When you create your secure passphrase, also create a secondary one, completely different e.g.   `secondary going factory transport`   ...`$otherphrase`
2. Generate a secondary bitcoin address by using `$otherphrase$randchars`  <-- the exact same `$randchars` as you used for your first term deposit address.
3. Save that bitcoin address somewhere, but don't transfer any coins to it (yet).

The reason for doing this is so that in a bruteforce scenario, you can ask other people to help find `$randchars` without exposing your life savings. e.g. You publish `$otherphrase` and the secondary bitcoin address, and publish the rules you used to create $randchars (i.e. how long, allowed characters, etc).

Optionally, you could transfer a small 'reward' amount into the secondary bitcoin address. If some 3rd party can generate the secondary address/priv key using `$otherphrase$randchars`, then they can tell you what `$randchars` is and you can access all your coins (using `$passphrase$randchars`).

"Part of the problem is that bitcoin was designed to give big rewards to early adopters in order to encourage people to start mining the coin.

This created a culture from the very start where people's incentive to get into bitcoin was to make money off it, rather than to use it as a currency.

This is especially bad when a small number of mining conglomerates have a huge amount of power in deciding the future of the currency. They make a huge amount of their money off appreciation of bitcoin, and very little off transaction fees, so their primary focus is on things that will keep bitcoins price increasing rather than things that will increase the use of the currency.

They have no financial interest in seeing bitcoin stabilize. And once all the coins are mined, their incentive will be to use their mining equipment to mine other currencies rather than to let that investment go to waste making a small percentage of transaction fees.";1;1;False;suninabox;dp8s3rb;⚡⚡⚡ Bitcoin hits $6,500 and reaches a new ATH ⚡⚡⚡;7a2i4x;https://i.imgur.com/qpBnqBN.png

"Don't worry too much, bitcoin is pretty confusing and you're not alone in feeling that way. You are on the right path with a wallet and exchange. Your goal should be to buy the desired amount of bitcoin on the exchange and then withdraw it to your wallet. Protecting your wallet is what makes you a bitcoin user and your own bank. Some people don't ever use their own wallet, they just use an exchange, and that is what I am warning against.

Buy bitcoin, withdraw to your wallet, and secure your private keys. What this security part means is up to you. For some people it means never letting private keys be on an online computer (you can actually send bitcoin while offline, delete your private key, and reconnect to the internet to send bitcoin), it means having encrypted backups of your private key or pass phrase in multiple places, it may even mean buying a ""hardware wallet"" which is a dedicated security device for holding bitcoin.

"> I don't think that's true at all, there are a lot of people investing and trading currencies.

Currency traders don't just buy up millions of dollars of currency and sit on it. 

The key word is currency trading, not currency speculation.

If you bought a million dollars of euros 15 years ago, you'd have less than a million dollars of euros today.

>Cryptos are 95%+ speculation

Which is what makes Bitcoins position incredibly precarious. If 95% of the value comes from speculation then 95% of the value will disappear once people can no profit from speculating on it.

"Your wallet will give you a private key or a pass phrase which equates to your private key.

When you create a bitcoin wallet your computer will create a private key and a corresponding public key. These keys are tied together. Your public key is your address, like an email address, and anyone wanting to send you bitcoin sends it to your public key. When you withdraw your bitcoin from the exchange you will send it to your public key.

When it comes time for you to send your bitcoin from your wallet you will need your private key. Once loaded into your wallet the private key will ""sign a transaction"" using some math, to prove that you control the funds associated to the corresponding public key. This signed proof gets sent to the bitcoin network and thats how bitcoin gets transfered. Your private key is the ownership of your bitcoins at the corresponding public key address.

You know thr saying ownership is 9/10ths the law? In bitcoin its 100% of the law.

"Its true that the more coins that are mined, the more work it takes to mine a coin. Whilst the amount of coins being produced is decreasing, the value of bitcoins is still increasing, and they make far more money from mining the coins than they do from transaction fees.

The higher the price of bitcoin the more money they make for each coin produced.

When it comes to votes on the future of Bitcoin, these mining groups have a huge amount of influence, and their incentives are all aligned to make sure they continue to make as much money as possible.

Transaction fees don't make a lot of money, and they're limited by the number of transactions happening, and there currently aren't many daily transactions because not many people are actually using bitcoin on a daily basis.

This is part of the reason why small transactions take so long to go through on bitcoin. They make a greater amount off processing large transactions so their incentive is to prioritize the largest transactions in the system.

Yeah, if you have full control over the wallet you should be fine. A hard fork is literally that, it just divides everything in two. Exchanges are a bit tricky as you don't actually own the bitcoin on them generally, it's just a contract between you and them. Because of that some exchanges have been a bit funny about giving people an equivalent to their BTC in BCH. I'd be a little less wary with this B2X fork, as if the exchange wants to stay in business they should be accommodating it, but still, retaining control over your own wallet is always the safest option.;1;0;False;HawkinsT;dp8fjja;⚡⚡⚡ Bitcoin hits $6,500 and reaches a new ATH ⚡⚡⚡;7a2i4x;https://i.imgur.com/qpBnqBN.png

No currency trader is just buying millions of dollars of euros and then sitting on them waiting them to go up in value. Currencies aren't speculative assets. Currency trading involves taking advantage of short term fluctuations in the value of currencies which helps liquidity and price signalling for people who want to exchange one currency for another.

Why is MySpace not worth billions? Because some idiot did create a better alternative. 

Being market leader is not enough to save you. It wasn't enough to save Netscape Navigator, it won't be enough to save Bitcoin.

The only thing that will work is actually being the most useful currency. Bitcoin is almost entirely useless as a currency outside of the black market, and its getting less useful over time as the % of people actually using it as a currency decreases and the % of people speculating on it increases, not to mention problems scaling and increasing transaction fees.

A speculative bubble is the last thing you want in a currency. The idea that it somehow helps adoption is pure bubble thinking. The volatility prevents adoptions and a large enough crash will cripple confidence and leave an opening for a competing coin to become market leader.

"CME sells derivatives, which represent characteristics of underlying assets in the time domain. (Think like when the dollar was backed by gold). 

Bitcoin is notorious for being hard to Short due to it's nature. You can either buy Bitcoin, or sell it if you already have it, but you can't sell Bitcoin you don't have and borrowing it is next to impossible. 

With derivatives, you can sell (short) Bitcoin (by buying the negative derivative of it) without owning any and then buy it back (sell the derivative) after the price has dropped. If the price doesn't drop you take a loss because you still need to buy it back to close out. 

The derivative writer makes money without trading the real Bitcoin if the price goes against you or stays constant because you pay a fee to set up the derivative contract with the writer of it in the first place. 

But hey, if you know the price is going to drop by half the next day, and you short Bitcoin, you'll make twice your money when cashing out of the derivative.

That's not even mentioning the more exotic ones such as leveraged (think +$10 per dollar gain) or options (I'll buy 100 Bitcoin at $6500 a month from now and I'll pay $1000 for that option) or the weird basket ETF style things ( ETH + BTC + ETC + Dogecoin price , all averaged out)

"You're not buying bitcoin to use as money though are you?

You're buying because you think its going to make you rich. 

No one buys dollars or euros or any other functional currency to get rich quick because currencies need to have a stable value to actually be useful.

No one wants to spend a currency that indefinitely increases in value, especially have access to other currencies that don't increase in value. If you have $1,000 in dollars and $1,000 in bitcoin, why would you spend bitcoins when they'll be worth more next year, but dollars will be worth less?

People buying up bitcoin and not using it as a currency are just making it less viable as a currency. As long as people keep speculating on it then the price will be too volatile for people to use it as real currency for everyday purchases.

In order for bitcoin to become a mainstream currency people have to regularly use it to buy and sell goods and services.

"> Where did I say all investments are bubbles? You are just creating a straw man at this point.

You made the straw man by inventing that I had said bitcoin is 'different than every type of investment vehicle' when all I said is that the ridiculous analogy of tulip mania does not apply. I was thus not making a straw man in return but attacking the position you had plucked out of thin air and ascribed to me.

> I’ll simplify this for you.

Don't patronize me by 'simplifying' it by actually giving your very first argument (which I appreciate and have been waiting a long time for). If you can't hold a grown-up conversation why bother interacting with other people in the first place?

As to the actual substance of your argument, I agree there is a lot of speculation and as a result it is very volatile, meaning ups and downs. It does have significant value as a currency as it has already shown in countries with significant inflation, but I do not believe it will ever replace or significantly compete with fiat. Its potential as such will only become fully realized once the speculation slows and when that happens there will be some significant drops, but I do not believe we are anywhere near that level yet, and I believe it will stabilize to something quite reasonable. It is overall far more akin to the gold rush than tulip mania, except it is known exactly how much there is and will ever be.
