"\>iOS

\> some weird reason

As a fellow developer, I think I found your problem :P

I had a similar idea last year, using the rollercoaster guy showing the history too instead of just the current moment.  Basically what you've done, with more history in view and less jumping. Haven't had the time to make it yet, but you're more than welcome to if you want.

Could go crazy and make it a VR rollercoaster if you want :D";1;0;False;PaulJP;dxh34cv;Crypto Rider - A free game I made about racing on Bitcoin and other crypto's historical price graphs! (more info in comments);8cpgxx;https://i.redd.it/jwhypb5p5bs01.gif

"Crypto Rider! A 2D racing game, where the tracks are historical price charts of popular Cryptocurrencies!

I was fed up of watching the charts during the bear market, so I thought I would make something a bit light hearted, to cheer myself and (hopefully) others up.

The game is easy to play, but hard to master. Also, no audio in the game as I imagined most people will be playing whilst travelling and listening to their own music.

** The game is free for iOS and Android devices. **

Download links:

[Crypto Rider iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/crypto-rider-bitcoin-racing/id1363093922)

So yeah give it a download and let me know what you think!  Post some suggestions on what levels or riders you like to see in future updates.

Anyways thanks for looking!

**UPDATE 1** : Just wanted to say a big thanks to everyone for up-voting and commenting and downloading. It has been a crazy few hours. As much as I want to stay up all night and read comments I have to work tomorrow(UK TIME)! It's crazy to see the game I spent months on finally out there in peoples hands :)

And I actually had an article written about a game I made? New personal best achieved! https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/16/someone-made-a-game-where-you-ride-the-rapidly-changing-prices-of-cryptocurrencies/

"**Final Fantasy VII Remake**

Final Fantasy VII Remake is an upcoming action role-playing game developed and published by Square Enix for the PlayStation 4. It is a remake of the 1997 PlayStation game Final Fantasy VII, retelling the original story following mercenary Cloud Strife as he and eco-terrorist group AVALANCHE battle against the corrupt Shinra megacorporation, and the rogue former Shinra soldier Sephiroth. Gameplay is planned to be a fusion of real-time action similar to Dissidia Final Fantasy, and strategic elements, and the game will be released as a multipart series.

Rumors and demands for a remake of VII existed for many years, but multiple reasons were given for why the project was not being developed.

"Yeah, the full SNES version was definitely superior for having the full interrogation scene.

And as for Cid, his dying is definitely the stronger scene. And hell, as much as he did for Celes, he kind of deserved it... literally the whole game is his fault. His Magitek research propelled the Empire into worldwide warfare, inspired the Emperor to genocide the Espers, and if that wasn't enough... Cid personally created Kefka. The Magitek Knight procedure may have been perfected by Leo and Celes, but Kefka... we don't even know what he was like before Cid ""augmented"" him. Maybe he was already a little shit... but look at Leo & Celes. Shockingly upstanding individuals, very honourable. Wouldn't it make sense that the first Magitek Knight was likely a similar individual? Cid may have single-handedly created the God of Destruction.
