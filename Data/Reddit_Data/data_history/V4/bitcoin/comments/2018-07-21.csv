"""Yea John... you're right, losing a mother is devastating, but that's how life is. You never know what's going to happen... like in the Bitcoin market for example. I recently invested about $3500, and sure, I may have lost a bit in dollar value, especially after I shorted at 6800, but that's fine. We all lose sometimes, loss is a part of life, I get it, but we just have to learn to live with these losses. Btw, I recently read about a small village in Africa that makes personalized coffins with international shipping. They only take bitcoin, so maybe this is what you've been waiting for to finally take the plunge.

This is it really. My best friend is huge on crypto. He basically forever me to buy are $3,400 and when I sold at $16,500 he was furious with me. Jokes on him, I bought a Honda Accord and a lambo sticker. To this day I don’t care about crypto, but I’m glad he brought me in that one time. Now he is all about Monero or something.

"I'm not sure this is the case.

Most people will literally work their life away to chase USD or other fiat. They wonder why they can't get ahead. They aren't interested in the mechanics of what gives USD value; yet they will slave away 40+ hours a week to for those USD.

The truth is; everybody cares. People get upset because talking about monetary policy brings into question the labor of their lives.

Most people get naturally defensive when they feel threatened or attacked; even subconsciously. So when I talk about the superiority of Bitcoin to USD and other fiat currencies what they are hearing is ""You've wasted your entire working life to support a conspiracy to keep you enslaved""

So people will naturally defend the object that they've been working for, for decades; as well as put up resistance to new ideas.

The idea that most people don't care about the mechanics of wealth creation is just not true. Everybody (almost) wants to be wealthier; and want to understand how to be wealthier. Its just that most people don't have the intellectual tools to even comprehend basic market dynamics and therefore aren't capable of digesting or parsing claims about monetary policy.

I've had quite a few college educated (in STEM fields) near retirement age adults, who own stocks, IRA, etc; who ask me ""Who/What determines the price of Bitcoin? It changes all the time""

People with millions in assets that are completely ignorant to how the market determines the price of anything. People who think that the prices of goods and services are set by other people and not by markets.

Most people care intimately about Wealth. We've just had such a ridiculous 150+ year economic bullrun hangover from the industrial revolution that people have been able to successfully get by and raise families for several generations without having to understand the dynamics of wealth.

"Bitcoin won't stop people from needing to work and I've never claimed that.  What I said is that people work their lives away for the almighty dollar without questioning what it is they are working for.

>Most people will literally work their life away to chase USD or other fiat. They wonder why they can't get ahead. They aren't interested in the mechanics of what gives USD value; yet they will slave away 40+ hours a week to for those USD.

Will Bitcoin end the need for work? Absolutely not.

But working for a deflationary money instead of an inflationary money allows people to retain and grow the value of their labor over time.

When you work for inflationary currency you are forced to make a decision and turn it into a relatively non-liquid asset like stocks, bonds, real-estate, etc in order to retain or grow its value.  Most people in the world are working paycheck to paycheck without any stored value.

The richest people in the world are those closest to the printing press and the banking institutions that inflate the currency supply through fractional reserve. The richest among us get to enjoy spending money created out of thin air before the impact of increased supply of currency reduces its value.

Those working paycheck to paycheck which is the vast majority of humanity, their wages are sticky. Their wages don't increase as the currency supply increases; at least not in lock-step. The poorest and hardest working people in the world are the ones that fiat currency inflation steals the most from.

I'm not one of those people who believe that we need to ""redistribute"" wealth; but I do strongly believe that the mechanics behind the money we all work for should be politically neutral and not designed to steal from the hardest working among us.";6;1;False;45sbvad;e2sd46j;Whenever I meet up with my nocoiner friends...;90lnu4;https://i.redd.it/xioukk5k77b11.png

"It takes the courage to accept possible failure due to your own mistakes when you take actions outside of what is ""normal"" and socially encouraged.

If you go with the flow and fail; well you're just doing what is expected of you in society. 

If you go on your own direction against the advice of others and fail; that failure is very clearly and obviously your fault.

In reality failure is failure and success is success. You own your actions and your decisions always follow your true beliefs about this world, even if they are in conflict with your vocally stated beliefs.

A person who believes in gravity does not walk off a cliff (unless they're suicidal). Every action a person takes is rooted in their deeply held beliefs about the way the world works. Part of the problem is that peoples beliefs about the way the world works can be easily influenced by their desires about the way the world should work, in spite of evidence to the contrary.";6;0;False;45sbvad;e2sb0yw;Whenever I meet up with my nocoiner friends...;90lnu4;https://i.redd.it/xioukk5k77b11.png
