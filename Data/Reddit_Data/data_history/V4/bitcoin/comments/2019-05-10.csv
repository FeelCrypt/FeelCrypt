""".@BradSherman was so concerned about $crypto users using #cryptocurrency for deceptive and illegal financial activity, yet his top campaign donation came from a company that had to forfeit $13.3 million to the US Government for facilitating illegal gambling."" -from the Coincenter twitter feed.

Remember who these politicians work for and get on Twitter and let them know how you feel. 

Personally, I find this attempt deeply insulting. As someone who was with one of the first units in Afghanistan after 911 and who has devoted years and years to the service of this government and its people, I am disgusted by people like this who so transparently take massive donations from banks and become mouthpieces for US hegemony and petrodollar dominance through bans, rather than meaningful marketplace competition. 

If the US dollar is so strong, then it should be robust enough to participate in a global economy that is bound to be rife with competitive challenges in fintech.... such as Bitcoin. and others. If we, as a people, need to resort to BANs to protect the dollar from these, it is evidence to the *contrary*- that the dollar is weak, not strong. That which warrants bans in favor of it, is by definition- weak. 

I strongly urge politicians and their millenial advisors (like the ones seated behind the Congressman in the video above) to stay true to your Constitutional principles and teach older politicians that in the global internet driven economy, banning only serves to isolate and weaken.. like AOL or Compuserve back in the 90's. Creating walled gardens- islands of stagnant innovation that were doomed to fail because they failed to expose their systems to the world. The dollar is no different. 

You risk turning ordinary, law abiding people like me into driven opposition to a hegemony of governmental bans. Because that is precisely what legislation like this would do.

"This exact guy has been saying things about Bitcoin for a long time now, long before the Democrats got the house.  At first this exact guy said Bitcoin was 'a crock', then he made fun of anybody who would use them as somebody 'sitting around their house in PJ's all day', now suddenly Bitcoin has the power to completely take away government control (according to him) and it needs to be 'nipped in the bud'.  He has even called on banning crypto before now, he said it last year too (July 18th, 2018).

If Democrats got on board with banning crypto, it would be in conjunction with Republicans, and it would be the moderates doing it. The ones that get huge contributions from the financial industry (one of Brad Sherman's top donors was a credit card processor).  The financial industry donated $339.2 million to the Republican party in 2016, and $289.6 million to the Democratic party in 2016.  In 2012 they donated $178 million to the Democrats, and $371 million to the Republicans. (2014 and 2018 midterms were also higher amounts going to Republicans).  Money talks in politics, so you can bet there's a lot more Brad Sherman's on the Republican side right now, people who got financial industry money to get to the office they are in right now.  On the Democrat's side the biggest financial industry receiver is Beto O'Rourke, with over $4 million in donations in 2018.  On the Republican side it's Martha McSally at $2.6 million in 2018 (Ted Cruz right behind her at $2.4 million).  Here's Brad Sherman (Allied Wallet is the credit card processor):  [https://www.opensecrets.org/members-of-congress/summary?cid=N00006897&cycle=2018&type=I](https://www.opensecrets.org/members-of-congress/summary?cid=N00006897&cycle=2018&type=I) .  

O'Rourke for 2020 might be pretty bad for bitcoin, but let's be honest - Trump is going to rubberstamp any bill McConnell tells him to unless Fox News tells him his base won't like it, so it isn't like Trump winning would make things safer for cryptoholders.   Now, somebody like say Bernie Sanders - well, for the 2016 cycle - finance didn't even make it into his top 20 donors (the finance industry really didn't want him to win).";1;1;False;ualdayan;emz5th8;Today in Congress Rep.

90% of the replies on this post are about how stupid this guy is, but in reality I think he’s a step ahead of those people. America has benefitted greatly from their world reserve currency status and if crypto ever replaces the dollar, it will be to the detriment of many Americans. Our country’s population is massively exposed in such a situation. I’ve been speculating if the Yuan/Euro replacing the dollar would drive the next economic crisis in America, but it could be crypto. Hopefully if it did ever reach IMF basket currency status, there would be a large number of Americans long on crypto by that point.;2;1;False;shorner;emyuq25;Today in Congress Rep.

"I don't think Congress is stupid enough to try to ""ban Bitcoin."" It's a worldwide protocol.  People could stock up on hardware wallets the way people stocked up on guns when Obama was elected (for fear he would ""ban guns"", etc.); software wallets are available via Tor; and mining is nothing but a process of data-hashing about as threatening itself as the search for the next highest prime number. Could Congress try to limit mining by stipulating that ""no one shall hash data at a rate in excess of *x y flops* per second""? Nonsense -- such a limitation surely would be inherently unconstitutional. Congress could try to impose stringent environmental controls on mining, but even then, there would be no local economic advantage in having miners in rural New York move to Canada and probably no environmental advantage either -- the key point being whether or not the electricity is subsidized to a rate below market level. Regardless, Canada would have to be onboard -- like it *wasn't* during Prohibition. Indeed ""banning"" Bitcoin would have parallels with ""banning"" alcohol.

It is hard to identify the constituency that Sherman, who represents the San Fernando Valley in California, is trying to impress. Congress isn't stupid enough to fall for it, and I doubt that many Californians are either.

"Faulty logic. They cannot prohibit crypto because they do not have global prohibition reach. They would have long ago banned the barbarous relic (having soaked up 7 trillion dollars in value and largely insulating its owners from vampiric Inflationary practices) but the Empire understands that they must remain somewhat competitive and relevant lest countless other countries will out compete them in the free market that is the world regulatory landscape. Outside of what this “representative” is paid to “think” as of late by the regulatory capture set, it is widely understood within the deep state that a country prohibits at its own risk, less that country watch capital, talent, innovation and numerous other forms of advantage flow to those political jurisdictions that respect and welcome it.


Multipolar world Gentleman. If US steps up BTC demonization rhetoric it becomes all the more appealing to the burgeoning global powers presently vying to trade outside the petrodollar paradigm. Game theory brought us the blockchain. Game theory demonstrates its continued viability and resilience in a world of competing global interests.
