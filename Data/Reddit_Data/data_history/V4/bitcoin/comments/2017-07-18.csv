Did a google search and it said one is worth 2000 something something USD. I'm sure it'll stabilize some day, but when and at how much is an important question. It certainly is an important currency for spending wherever conventional payment methods fail. Hell, PayPal still doesn't even do porn sites. I need to look into that though, because if it dips to 50$ it does sounds good to me. I can see how price swings could happen if someone's shoving a couple million USD around, making them disappear, or some ransomware making it big. Bitcoin feels more like stocks that are being used as currency and that are utterly uncontrolled. Be careful with actual gambling though. The house always wins - with Bitcoin at least there is no house. ;2;1;False;;dkdf7sf;John bets on Bitcoin;6nvgty;https://i.redd.it/giqzirlwg7az.jpg
"Same here.  Around 7 years ago I was still living with my parents and they where still in control of money at that time.  I practically begged them to let me get $100 worth of Bitcoins of my own money for a fun investment but considering they hardly even used the internet they didnt let me ""throw my money"" away.  This year when I last saw them I brought up Bitcoins and told them that if they let me buy those Bitcoins on my birthday I could have payed for my college, a small house, and a car.  It was meant as a job but they actually felt extremely guilty.  :(";1;0;False;MercenaryOfTroy;dke8ldo;John bets on Bitcoin;6nvgty;https://i.redd.it/giqzirlwg7az.jpg

"**Spotted dick**

Spotted dick is a British pudding, made with suet and dried fruit (usually currants and/or raisins) and often served with custard.

It is made from a flat sheet of suet pastry sprinkled with dried fruit, which is then rolled up into a circular pudding.

The dish is first attested in Alexis Soyer's The modern Housewife or ménagère, published in 1849, in which he described a recipe for ""Plum Bolster, or Spotted Dick—Roll out two pounds of paste ... have some Smyrna raisins well washed..."".

There is constrained supply of land and fossil fuels too.  They have perceived value but price rises aren't certain.

I think precious metals are the best analogy to cryptocurrencies.  They are difficult to mine.  All the cheaply mined stuff is already mined and owned by someone.  There's a finite amount on Earth and no more can be created or destroyed.  They have little utility as anything other than a store of value, a medium of exchange or a unit of account.  At the moment, they are best as a store of value.  At least with gold and platinum, you can make jewelry from it.  Bitcoin's potential utility is diminished unless it is a proper medium of exchange.

"I don't know.  Why does the model of buy and hold have to be smart for cryptos to succeed?

Might be that they're a better short-term play, and medium of exchange, than they are a place to park your wealth in the hope of getting rich.

But even then, just because bitcoin, the first and not the best technologically because others have improved on it, isn't the one that winds up on top, doesn't mean another one couldn't gain top spot and keep it more than 5 years.

Your whole rationale seems to be : bitcoin was first so it has to lead the crypto market and will never be abandoned.  And you don't have any real reason to assume this will be true forever, especially when some of the others have improved on some of bitcoin's shortcomings.

That's like saying the Model T should have ruled the auto market forever even when better cars came along.  I don't see why.  The only thing I can think is that you have too much invested, financially and emotionally, in bitcoin to allow you to countenance any world where it doesn't stay on top forever.

"Hey bitcoin 1989 - You seem like you know what you are talking about. I need your advice. I'm a 59 yr old mom of 4 boys probably your age (1980-1995). I just sold the family home, hence I have maybe $2-5k I can finally gamble nightmare-free to try and make some seed money for retirement. I bought about $1,500 BTC during the down spiral this week and a little Ether. Yes, I'm out of my depth - but desperate to try and make a profit for a change. Do I wait until after Aug (possible split) to see what happens before putting any more money into the crypto market?  Do you have any idea what happens to BTC that is currently owned if split does occur -- do I have to figure out how to pick alternate btc?  or Do I stop and do nothing further until after split?  
NO, I didn't tell boys I did this -- they would freak that ""mom"" is wasting money. At these low levels of investment -- is it even worth it? I am hoping if I can get at least 1+ BTC and 5+ ETH, I might have a chance of a small nest egg in 5+ years. (No eating of dicks involved).
I would appreciate your opinion when you have the time.

You might *think* you can easily buy one and let it sit. But if you are asking the question, you are implicitly saying that you can not.

Your view of yourself doesn't match up with your actions.

So for you, no. It's not worth it.

Adoption = Demand. If more people are finding it useful then more people will be needing to buy bitcoin to use it. Since the supply of Bitcoin is so constrained that means people will very quickly be out bidding each other and paying more. I think you are right that crazy price volatility will scare away and make alot of use cases difficult. So we see this insane Oh! bitcoin is useful I should get some. Holly crap! the price of the bitcoin I just bought is sky high I should sell it before it crashes. Causing a huge crash type behavior. One day bitcoin and bitcoin knowledge will reach a point of difusion where it will allow it to be valued accurately and the price volatility will subside. I can garantee without a doubt that that price will be between 0 and infinity.;2;1;False;Bitcoin_Acolyte;dkdr7j3;John bets on Bitcoin;6nvgty;https://i.redd.it/giqzirlwg7az.jpg

That is actually in correct. You can prevent a transaction but you will be found out very quickly. You can double spend but you will be found out relatively quickly. You can't steal someone's money. You can't create more Bitcoin. Everyone on the bitcoin network validates and enforces the rules wether they are minning or not.

Trading on bitcoin is reckless and had I had the money to do so I would have done, knowing full well the risks because the trend TO ME was clear... but I absolutely would not have been left dumbfounded had I lost money. The trend is clear, don't trade on bitcoin thats stupid... but don't bet against it either, that would be equally stupid and most of us have nothing to lose in that case, but there are a lot of institutions who could be missing out on billions by not ACCEPTING the writing on the wall.

"Ironically, one of things preventing Bitcoin from being a fully fledged currency is its exchange rate volatility.  Rising another 480k in 3yrs would pretty much kill it as a medium of exchange because who would spend it today when it could be worth a lot more tomorrow?  That means take up by providers of goods and services would also be slowed, partly due to less demand and partly because they would have to deal with exchange rate risk on something which is super volatile.

The best thing for bitcoin (and all cryptocurrencies) now would be a long period of exchange rate stability so that consumers and providers can build their trust and infrastructure so that it can serve its intended purpose:  as a currency, not just a speculative position.";8;1;False;cabramattacowboy;dkde5rl;John bets on Bitcoin;6nvgty;https://i.redd.it/giqzirlwg7az.jpg

"I don't believe it. I believe with some confidence that we *won't* see $500k in 3 years. At $500k, bitcoin will still be a pipsqueak currency in the global economy, so prices will still be mostly denominated in government-fiat currencies. That includes electricity. $500k bitcoin would require some tradeoff between 500GW dedicated to mining vs. much higher electricity prices than now. I don't think we can bring another **50% of global electricity production** online within the next 3 years, so bitcoin mining will be competing for the ""same electricity"" (nitpick: it's fungible) as the rest of the economy, driving prices up while also displacing other uses of electricity. Both of these effects would slow down the economy. I don't think a serious economic contraction is compatible with $500k bitcoin.

To answer the objection that bitcoin mining is part of the economy: yes, that's true, but I don't think it's a very productive sector. By design, all that work done by miners is ""useless"". There's no loaf of bread you can eat or manufactured item you can use to improve total utility.

Another objection: if another halvening happens, then the numbers shift to 250GW / 25% of total.

"**Spotted dick**

Spotted dick is a British pudding, made with suet and dried fruit (usually currants and/or raisins) and often served with custard.

It is made from a flat sheet of suet pastry sprinkled with dried fruit, which is then rolled up into a circular pudding.

The dish is first attested in Alexis Soyer's The modern Housewife or ménagère, published in 1849, in which he described a recipe for ""Plum Bolster, or Spotted Dick—Roll out two pounds of paste ... have some Smyrna raisins well washed..."".

"That's a jump from 42b$ to 9.55t$ if you take in consideration there will be around 19.1m bitcoins in 3 years from now and a price of 500.000$ per bitcoin.

That's more than the current entire gold value. This will not happen, let's be real. Bitcoin if anything at best will hit a 50.000$ mark in 2021/2022. There's still a lot to take care of before BTC goes into daily life of everyone. Especially increasing the limit of bitcoin's transactions per second. But yes, we just need to fix our problems and live through them. Once bitcoin reaches around 35.000$ or 40.000$ the snowball will just begin. Money does not come from nowhere, there's a limited amount of money in the world. Hitting 40.000$ mark in 2020-2022 would mean bitcoin achieved a 1 trillion market cap. Something this big cannot be ignored and will only snowball from that point on because other investment options will lose value due to a new competition.

Astonishing though how bitcoin within just a few years from it's creation may end up having more value than gold. I do believe if we reach 500.000$ per bitcoin - it will happen at best in 2027/2028.";1;1;False;Alphazz;dke9qd4;John bets on Bitcoin;6nvgty;https://i.redd.it/giqzirlwg7az.jpg

"Terrible bet to make.

Why is bitcoin the best crypto?  Just because it was first?

Others that are technologically better will eclipse bitcoin.  The entire market cap of cryptos is going way up, and maybe bitcoin will lead that charge for a while.  But that doesn't mean Bitcoin is going to have all the gains, or even stay in the lead.
