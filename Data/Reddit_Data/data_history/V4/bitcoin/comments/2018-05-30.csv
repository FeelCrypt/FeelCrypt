Besides, wirering $10 Euros worth of fiat money is stupid.

Only rich people get special bank accounts to protect against this (I wanted to figure out how to ripp off scammers and found this loop hole, but the banks that offered that protection requires big bank balances and high account opening fees to be eligible for that specialized protection) the rest of us banked non-rich people have to fill out paper work after theft has occurred making us wait for our property to be returned and cleared of any wrongful overdrafts and legal liability.

This is also why BitCoin and other cryptocurrencies are so awesome, no one can charge your account when you send them initial funds -- it's a one way non-reversable transaction using a public address that cannot be charged.

"**XHTML**

Extensible Hypertext Markup Language (XHTML) is part of the family of XML markup languages. It mirrors or extends versions of the widely used Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), the language in which Web pages are formulated.

While HTML, prior to HTML5, was defined as an application of Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), a flexible markup language framework, XHTML is an application of XML, a more restrictive subset of SGML. XHTML documents are well-formed and may therefore be parsed using standard XML parsers, unlike HTML, which requires a lenient HTML-specific parser.

XHTML 1.0 became a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Recommendation on January 26, 2000.

""In mathematics, orthogonal coordinates are defined as a set of d coordinates q = (q1, q2, ..., qd) in which the coordinate surfaces all meet at right angles (note: superscripts are indices, not exponents). A coordinate surface for a particular coordinate qk is the curve, surface, or hypersurface on which qk is a constant. For example, the three-dimensional Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z) is an orthogonal coordinate system, since its coordinate surfaces x = constant, y = constant, and z = constant are planes that meet at right angles to one another, i.e., are perpendicular. Orthogonal coordinates are a special but extremely common case of curvilinear coordinates.""

Though tbh, 1 BTC or any Satoshis would be nice as I have been living off of $400/m since 2009 (that's $4,800/yr which I found out today is less than the average wage of the 1930s in the USA, fml lol). Yet, since learning Day Trading and Scalp Trading I'm optimistic that cryptocurrencies may be the sling shot I need to swing me out of poverty -- of which I have yet to incur any actual loss of my initial investment back when I started with a $50 USD investment at the end of December 2016. Thus, with every gain I build off of my small initial investment trading portfolio is a gain in savings I may one day soon liquidate to fund a business launch and thereby obtain secure housing with such an income finally after becoming homeless back in August of 2014 (though by 2015 I was offered free room and board, yet the State still categorizes me as homeless since I'm living with friends where I'm not exactly a leasing occupant). Regardless, I'm pretty confident in my plan to exicute this upward mobility quest of mine, as I have yet to take any trading losses; *and* I already once had a business in the 2000s so I've already been around that block albeit it was humble compared to what my newly found ambitions are today.
