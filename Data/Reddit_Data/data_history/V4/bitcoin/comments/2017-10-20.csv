Maybe, maybe not. We'll see.

> You're rationalizing some irrational behaviors.

Or it just looks that way from your point of view.

> There's zero reason that the thing to dethrone Bitcoin has to be based on the Bitcoin ledger.

I tried to explain why I do think that this is the case. We're already seeing people moving on to that with Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold or SegWit2x. With every new bitcoin users and every new transaction it get's exponentially harder to argue: hey all, let's start from scratch! Anyone making such a proposal will be asked loudly by millions in unison: ""WHY?"".

There's not a single good reason to make the next thing not be based on the bitcoin ledger. You want to restart because you missed the train with bitcoin and want to get into a good start position this time around? Forget it.

> Facebook isn't based on the Myspace ledger...it just shut Myspace down by being a superior product.

Another indicator that the ""mind blown!"" moment of bitcoin is still ahead of you. Apples and oranges.

> I wish you the best of luck, but you're playing a dangerous game and I don't think you are adequately evaluating the risk because you are too emotionally invested in your investments.

Rest assured that I draw the line somewhere. I'm far beyond the usually suggested ""5% of your assets"", but I don't take on credit to buy bitcoin nor am I all in fiat-wise. But it is in fact the only *investment* I have. (But I don't think I would own stock at this point, even without bitcoin.)

I acknowledge that there's risk, but at this point it's mostly the potential to somehow lose my private keys.

And yes, I am emotionally invested in bitcoin. But I don't let that drive my buying behaviour. I buy fixed amounts in regular intervals as a long term investment without looking at the price at all. If I lose all of it, it would fucking hurt, but it wouldn't have any effect on my lifestyle.

I could also argue that you're too emotionally invested in the idea that such a paradigm shift and immense value transfer can't happen right before your eyes without you recognizing it as such.

You maybe missed the point of what bitcoin is. Its a currency platform. It was never intended to be an investment, but it was clear there was a possibility. The miners and early adopters who speculated its success are the ones who stood to make a lot of money because they stood up the currency. That isn't a Ponzi scheme, at least not intentionally. Let's all understand, there are people who use bitcoin and other crypto to pay for things and people who use crypto as an investment.

BTC is a new class of asset, that literally appeared over night. People are putting money ""into"" it, but noone knows how much each bitcoin should be worth. What we're seeing, is the market filling the bitcoin with it's true value.

The early believers are getting their reward. I wasn't that early, but I still believe in a nice reward. I think of it more as a head start to when it's more possible to rely in bitcoin usage in daily life.

Your original claim that ""Supply and demand"" is the reason is more accurate. Liquidity of Bitcoin is low. There is a small supply of Bitcoin available for sale at current market value. Which is why the price spikes anytime a few million dollars want to enter the ecosystem. These people will actually have to purchase over several different exchanges to get the coins remotely near the original market value, while driving the price up significantly. Which then triggers margin calls for short-sellers to cover, further driving the price up.

"You really do have a hard time spending it easily. Unless you use a debit card that you load with bitcoin? that basically is like taking x bitcoin to the exchange and cashing it out and carrying around x bitcoin worth of dollars in your pocket around to buy stuff. If you are ""spending"" bitcoin you need to go to the super market and transact a bitcoin transaction in exchange for goods, or at your car repair shop for services. Until that is wide done and accepted im sorry man, you are dealing with something that is traded for cash to be useful. Most businesses using bitcoin are taking your payment in bitcoin when you send it to them and direct converting it to cash dollars in their bank account. Things are coming along and some of these stepping stones are necessary to bring it up to full adoption, but you are kidding yourself a bit if you think that its a currency at present. 

Currency: a system of money in GENERAL use in a particular country.
Currency: the fact or quality of being generally accepted or in use.

Sorry friend i don't think bitcoin in its current state qualifies for general use or generally accepted. It has all the potential but you are not there yet. Go down to your local super market and grab a loaf of bread and when the cashier asks you for a dollar tell them how much bitcoin is that and what address to send it to. where will that get you?

"i wrote ""when you can't convert your btc to hard currency it's worth 0 usd all of a sudden.""
so when you can't convert btc into us-dollar/euro is practically dead, i hope you agree. 

of course, i acknowledge that there will be possibilities to evade a ban on trading bitcoin. i also acknowledge that governments will try to combat illegal trade. bank accounts are basically completely monitored by the financial authorities today. so, i don't believe it will be sufficient linking a foreign exchange account to your local bank account. who wants to be dependent on exchanging money in the black market (peer to peer transactions)?  
 it's impossible that all this has no impact on the btc exchange rate. btc will be a lot less attractive to potential investors. maybe not you, maybe not your friends. but for sure the kind of investors that are driving the bitcoin/usd rate up so steep to ever higher values.
Also, I cannot see the governments have been listening to the people a lot in the past say 50 years. so, as long as the political system remains the way it is now, I believe the governments' actions are not at all refelecting the will of their constituents. and when they do it will not go unpunished as we've seen repeatedly in the past and as it can be  currently seen in venezuela.

"People are buying, but not spending. 

And every time the news writes about BTC breaking a new level, more people want in on it. Some buyers are aiming for the stars, others want to make a quick but risky buck. 

In a sense, the current rise can be compared to a classic pump'n dump penny stock scheme. Only instead of a worthless penny stock, it's a complex currency that many owners don't understand. The only thing many DO know, is that if everyone buys and holds, the value will go up. And the insane publicity just keeps attracting buyers. 

If people started spending it on actual products, they would create supply. Store owners would need to sell their BTC to pay for rent, products, salaries, etc. (so long none of those can be bought or paid with cryptocurrencies), so the spent BTC would go back into the market.

"the reason that bitcoin has sky rocketed in value is because people are buying it as an investment. As more people buy it the price will go up. when people stop wanting to buy and start wanting to sell it the price will go down.

there is nothing that gives bitcoin any value other than the people buying it as an investment. at least until it starts becoming widely accepted as a currency which will happen if enough powerful people buy shares of it. if they don't then it will bubble and crash and when it crashes people will start buying again and it will go up again. this will continue until it falls into the hands of someone who can push it into becoming an acceptable form of currency at which point the value will sky rocket into figures that are way above $6000.

or it will never be widely accepted as a currency and it will crash and become worthless and all these people buying at $5000 will lose tremendous amounts of money.";8;2;False;filter_out_politics;dona2vm;6000 motherfuckers!;77ml0a;https://i.redd.it/cft3xqmq00tz.png

"Literally no one can economically explain why BTC is doing anything. It is factually wrong to claim there is evidence of any kind to support BTC gains given it has existed over 10 years, and spontaneously jumps nearly 90% in a single year (most of which was in the last 4 months). If BTC was a commonly traded stock, betters would've shorted it and it would've plummeted to $2500 twice over now. Even Goldman Sachs doesn't understand how to bet on BTC despite manipulating currency being their primary profession.

As for how to explain it logically, the twin jumps BTC has shown both occurred on the worst market days this year if you factor in the 1~ day buyer's delay on the S&P500/NASDAQ. People have been speculating a Bear market for over a year now, and these 7-10% dips cause people to transfer their wealth into BTC, assuming the full bear is hitting (but it hasn't yet).";22;5;False;;dondbqs;6000 motherfuckers!;77ml0a;https://i.redd.it/cft3xqmq00tz.png

"The simplest, truest answer is that there are more Bitcoins trying to be bought than sold.

Other reasons:

* Segwit2x concerns are disappearing, especially considering this is our second fork. We can kinda predict what will happen.
* Bitcoin has constantly been growing in terms of user base. Most of my peers have shifted their opinions from ""I don't want to buy such a risky investment"" to ""I should probably just buy a little""
* People who have made money from Bitcoin are still buying some, even at this high of a price
* Public knowledge is increasing
* It seems that Wall Street and other financial experts are on the fence and disagreeing on how Bitcoin is going to play out
* We are seeing more and more that government controlled money isn't necessarily better than cryptocurrency in terms of experienced benefits of the majority of the world
* Increased segwit support and adoption

The ease of use of the dollar may be helped by favorable treaties that may not have been as favorable had the US not been a superpower. But wars don't help the US economy and don't help bolster the value of the dollar. In fact, having a strong military that mostly stays *out* of wars is the best for the dollar. And the government doesn't really have much to gain from keeping the value of the dollar high. As inflation rises, tax revenues also rise so the buying-power of tax money in total stays the same (or rises with productivity). And the FED can simply create more money as needed to keep up with any inflation. The main concern is keeping the dollar strong against other national currencies. Banning bitcoin won't help do that, tho it would preserve the ability for the FED to extract value from dollar holders via inflation. Bitcoin's ability to close the inflation loophole is the only incentive governments have to ban it. ;1;1;False;fresheneesz;donnfc7;6000 motherfuckers!;77ml0a;https://i.redd.it/cft3xqmq00tz.png

"> I like most of sehwit, but my main qualm is that witness data doesn't cost a fee, unlike the transaction info.

Witness data is just discounted, not free. There's also a fair rationale for why:

Since the witness data only satisfies spending conditions for the inputs, it doesn't relate to the outputs and thus doesn't grow the UTXO set. In other words, the witness discount makes creating outputs more expensive relative to consuming inputs than what was the case for legacy transactions.

While a bitcoin node stores the full blockchain history, once validated, it's only really useful for sharing with other nodes and to backtrack during chain reorgs. Validation of new transactions happens against the UTXO set which is stored in a separate database which thus contains every currently existing bitcoin balance.

Because of the different sizes and access patterns, it could make sense to store the blockchain history (big, low activity) on a HDD and the UTXO set (smaller, high activity) on a SSD. For this reason it also makes sense to penalize growing the UTXO set more than just growing the blockchain history, and this is what the segwit discount achieves.";1;0;False;largely_useless;donjj29;6000 motherfuckers!;77ml0a;https://i.redd.it/cft3xqmq00tz.png

Every day, more businesses legitimize BTC. A currency which was once associated with drug-dealing sites like Silk Road, is now being associated with sites like Overstock.com, Home Depot, DirectTV, Microsoft, and Dell. Every day, more large institutional investors start buying into it. Every day that it isn't hacked and it doesn't plummet, confidence in it grows. Right here in my little city, there are several restaurants which accept it. That list grows every day. Et cetera, et cetera. 

Bottom-line: there is steadily (exponentially) increasing demand for it... yet the supply remains basically constant.

As for the sudden and erratic jumps in price, that's slightly more complicated, but easily explainable.

The more people that buy into bitcoin, the higher the price will go.  Aren't we in the 0.1%?  We are still early adopters.  HODL.  Lately, every time it climbs there is some media coverage that causes the average Joe who didn't even know what bitcoin is to buy in.  On top of that normal ebb and flow behavior, there is a fork happening for Bitcoin Gold Oct 25 and another fork for segwit2x happening mid-Nov.  People will get equal amounts of each new coin as they already have bitcoin.  So many people are dumping alt-coins to build up their bitcoin stash for the free coins.  I expect the price to go down a few days (hours, even?) after the 2nd fork as people go back to their fav alt-coins.  ;4;1;False;RandyInLA;donep9z;6000 motherfuckers!;77ml0a;https://i.redd.it/cft3xqmq00tz.png

"Calling it a hijacking is being a bit facetious.  It was *intended* to be a well-supported part of the segwit2x/nya agreement that miners signalled in order to enable segwit (step 1 of the 2 step plan of reaching sw2x)

Unfortunately, a lot of the original sw2x supporters only wanted segwit and quickly began backtracking after segwit locked in. In doing so, sw2x went fr o m having a *reasonable semblence* of consensus to a diminishing support group, which is a bit of a catch-22 as it became more contentious, more people withdrew support.

I fully supported sw2x, but with the fact that a significant part of the ecosystem has drifted away or pulled support from it, it has obviously become contentious. Imo people on both sides are playing dumb politics by refusing to cooperate on a path that has full consensus, and in the process sw2x is unlikely to succeed with enough support. As much as I wanted it to succeed, I now feel we need to ditch the 2x for now and revisit the drawing board.

There's no such thing as the ""intrinsic"" value of any asset, two entities decide to make a deal that met both parties criteria, where those criteria might very well be specific to each of them. 

If you think your house is worth 200k and toy sell it for a 180k is just because you wanted to reduce the risk and get guaranteed money today instead of waiting for the next one who might very well offer just 150k. So yes, you have less money in your bank account but you also mitigated a risk. Purple often tend to forget that risk is part of the equation and how much risk your willing to take depend on many factors.

Putin has perhaps seen the threat of fiat bleed, speculative attacks, hyperbitcoinisation and all that, before any one else. 

Russians are, generally, intelligent and paranoid. Often a good combination (sometimes not). 

If Russia moves to a completely controlled electronic cash economy then it can effectively prevent all exchange of “cryptoRuble” for bitcoin. 

Yes, some people will still be able to exchange, but not the great, unwashed masses.

"I really really really thought this was bullshit, but after thinking and talking about it with a few other people, this is pretty bullish i think. 

No doubt, the ""crypto"" ruble is bullshit in so far as it is not actually a crypto currency and that it isn't decentralized, but it's still useful.

I'll quote the example my brother gave was as follows (see if you can poke holes):

""Japanese Bob wants to buy Russian bonds at 8% yield, as Japanese bonds pay -.5%.  Russia, understandably so, refuses to let it's bonds be denominated in anything other than Rubles.""

""Current scenario - Bob sets up a Russian brokerage account (assuming he can't get his local brokerage to source the bonds due to trade sanctions) , Bob uses SWIFT, waits 3 or 4 days for it to clear, possibly routing through multiple countries. Bob then buys the bonds and holds. At some point he sells or they mature, he then has to reverse the whole thing.""

""New scenario - Bob buys BTC (this could take some time for traditional funds to settle depending on method ). Bob creates an account and sends them to the Russian exchange, buys bit-rubles then buys the bonds, all on a blockchain so they settle instantly.  He then reverses the trades when he feels like it and either sells the BTC or keeps it.""

You might ask why Russia doesn't just legalize the buying of bonds via BTC. The reason is that they don't want to denominate the bonds in BTC, so they have to take a ruble or a ruble equivalent. 

My next question was, why not just allow people to buy rubles with bitcoin. I don't actually know how difficult that would be, but the assumption was that perhaps it would be easier just to set up a new alt so the exchanges can easily integrate it. 

What do you think?

"Yes but it also adds unprecedented transparency to those fiat currencies depending on implementation. None the less it allows outsiders a much more in depth view into your fiat currency. This is great for smaller nations who can't produce that information with out large costs to running their government. 

Would you rather the fed reserve be completely secret or be able to view a blockchain that they might be able to alter but every watch dog on earth invested into that currency will most likely catch it. Again depending on implementation which is what really matters.   


Look to the economics and transparency of it.

"I say this all the time, the strongest aspect of crypto currency is how it can easily be integrated with bigger systems. Rewarding people with tokens that hold monetary value like gold has a ton of potential.

A fiat crypto can be very useful as it allows the state to dynamically integrate socialized programs that do not meddle with the free market. For example, paying people to do things like clean the streets. Its also possibly the best vector for a government mandated UBI.

We should have state or government crypto currencies. As long as they don't meddle with other crypto currency the idea is welcome in my opinion. ";3;1;False;;dolz72t;CryptoRuble my ass;77drja;https://i.redd.it/5p5oqk1qursz.jpg
