">Part of the allure

No one that owns a relatively new rolls is nickel and dimeing for much. Youre still paying six figures, this isn't an early 2000's M3. That said it is only *part* of the allure of luxury vehicles. Self made rich people don't become rich by being stupid with their money. $20,000 for tires is stupid unless you're stupidly rich. The average millionaire doesn't care about frauding you, they just want a nice car and some of them don't care for being ripped off simple because they have the money.

This is about who their main target market and customer base is, not if there are exceptions to the rule here and there.

I didn't say people with money HAVE to spend it - just that the people who buy Rolls Royce's fall into the category of those who aren't generally concerned about saving a measly $20k. That's what a target market is - it's a blanket demographic of who is most likely to be purchasing a certain product. 

Go visit a Rolls Royce dealership and ask them about who their purchasers are - and see if the majority of these people are concerned about saving a few bucks.

Nothing wrong with saving money. But the target market of a Rolls Royce owner is not that of a penny pinching bargain hunting consumer. It just isn't. 

I think some of you are out of touch with just how much wealth is out there and how truly disposable money is to some people. 

Also the wealthy who like to live low key frugal lives - as there definitely are some - would not be purchasing a Rolls Royce in the first place because it's the polar opposite of low key or frugal.

"There’s levels to this. There’s a huge secondary market of people with new S-Class money who are interested in a barely-used Phantom or Brooklands. Just like there’s people with new Rolex money who are interested in a gently used Vacheron.

Personally, I bought an expensive luxury car for 25% of MSRP because it had 4k miles on it. Could I afford it new? Sure. But I’m a stickler for money management and refuse to pay sticker because that’s financially irresponsible. This applies to almost every facet of life - being selectively frugal adds up.

My favorite wristwatch was bought used. It means no less to me than luxury watches bought brand new. It’s pretty and it tells time.

"Theres a level of wealth - generally that of Rolls Royce owners and the like - where the thought of ""saving $20k"" isn't even something on their radar. These people don't have to worry about staying rich. It's a level of wealth that's hard to grasp.

If you can afford to purchase and spec out a brand new phantom - options that can run you $200,000+ in addition to the $400k cost of the car - you're not going to turn around and try to save a few grand on tires. That is not the demographic that generally purchases a Rolls Royce. It's not impossible, just highly improbable.

The ultra wealthy who live the type of sensible/frugal life you're talking about drive a Toyota Camry or a Cadillac and stay low key. ";1;0;False;DEEPFIELDSTAR;e2jgtvk;Bentley with bitcoin hood ornament;8zd7my;https://i.redd.it/9v1fszu9oca11.jpg
"I do see your point and normally I’d agree with you if we were talking about an S-class or a 5/7 series BMW - but a Rolls has a much different target market. People with Rolls Royce money generally are not looking to purchase second hand cars. A big part of purchasing a Rolls Royce is the midboggling amount of bespoke options available. You want that car built for you. If you have the money to buy a Phantom chances are very high that you belong to the class of people with true fuck-off money. 

Yeah sure I guess you can have money and buy one second hand but to me that’s cutting out a big chunk of the experience. 

It’s like people who finance expensive watches. The point of an expensive watch is to reward yourself for earning it - not to go into debt just so people might think you’re rich.
