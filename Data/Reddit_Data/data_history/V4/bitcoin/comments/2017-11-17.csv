"Your original comment. 

>They make 1 battery bank type and when you pay extra you get more kwh unlocked. Its logical to manufacture only minimum differences in components, all car manufacturers do similar things.

Tesla does indeed make more than one pack .. ( I believe you conceded this point already ) 

Next we look at the second point. **all** car manufactures do ""similar things"" 


The ""things"" that tesla did , was to have a software lock that degrades both range and performance. 

I concede that most ( if not all ) automakers will use similar , if not identical parts across various lines. I just do not agree that using the same steering rack for all your lines is anywhere near the same 'thing' as having a software lock ( that you can pay to have removed ) that degrades range and performance. 


Next , lets look at the word ""similar"" for a moment. Because I believe this may be where we are having the biggest difference of opinion. 

From https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/similar

>1 :having characteristics in common :strictly comparable

>2 :alike in substance or essentials :corresponding
no two animal habitats are exactly similar —W. H. Dowdeswell

>3 :not differing in shape but only in size or position similar triangles similar polygon

What tesla did with these two specific models is to have a software lock that degrades both range and performance. 

GM making 4 versions of its LS1 with various internal parts and or different induction systems does not fit the definition of similar 

GM de-tuning a 700 HP version of its LS1 for use with a 'less strong' transmission does not fit the definition of similar. 

What would be similar ( even though it doesn't degrade range )  would be requiring ( or giving the option to ) a hellcat buyer to pay an additional fee to get the red key. for reference https://artofgears.com/2015/11/10/this-is-why-the-srt-hellcat-has-two-keys

GM doesn't sell a version of the hellcat without the red key. 

To side track for a bit , you compare a battery pack to a gas tank. Close , but not quite.  The size of the battery pack is the bottleneck for two major things. The range ( which makes it similar to the gas tank in that respect ) however it also determines the peak current output of the pack. A battery technology and construction method determines a batteries ""C"" rating. To figure out the peak current the pack can provide , you multiply the C rating by the size of the pack.  a 60kwh pack would be c X 60 as the peak , a 70 would be 70 X C.  Tesla did not software limit just the range , they also limited the peak current. The software lock causes the larger pack to perform exactly the same ( similarly to ) a physically different pack.

"No, the correct term is an OEM Options dealer. Once I am home I can happily scan to you the brochure of a factory commodore from Holden listing the options from Walkinshaw, a list in the same brochure as Holden's options. Also they don't purely rebuild vehicles they can do option packages coinciding with options from Holden. So unfortunately you're incorrect in that part.

Regarding my original statement, of course they do seperate sized Amp/hr packs for their range of vehicle classes. But for a single vehicle model, a single battery package is the most cost effective option. No car manufacturer installs 4 different types of fuel tanks for 4 different options levels on vehicles, so why being battery packs are fuel tanks for electric cars would Tesla do any different?

To continue with the discussion points I have brought in every single comment thus far. Show me another all electric vehicle that is semi autonomous and highly computerized? I know for a fact many Mercedes models, BMW models both have many options that a simple software install will allow use. Even most lower value cars have options that software will allow the upgrade to be used. Sat Nav is an obvious upgrade. Most vehicles have the facilities from the middle models up, some require a simple software update to access it. 

You speak of changing goal posts yet in your last paragraph you talk about going from a base package to a top of the line. Even in ICE powered cars this is clutching at straws. Nowhere have I spoken about going from a 30,000 base model car to a 70000 top of the line car. Tesla's upgrade option is not like going from a 2ltr 4cyl to a 7ltr 600hp v8. You seem to be creating strawmen to simply attack my valid point without ever countering the argument with your own. So i return the question, what is your issue in a free global market of a manufacturer with hundreds of millions of cost in RnD, creating a system of ease of install and a simple process for those willing to pay to be able to ascertain an upgrade? 

My personal favourite part of this whole discussion is yourself saying ""Tesla would actually install a larger pack and software limit it to a lower capacity as Its cheaper to produce one battery pack and software lock it , than to produce and install a lower capacity pack."". So now we have proven your simply being argumentative for some petty reason beyond comprehension I think our discussion is done.

The correct term is ""remanufacturer"" The car gets a COMPLETELY  new vin number ( not just a few digits changed for option packages ) , it's in no way OEM. its no longer a holden. OEM is ford's SVT or subaru's STI or toyota's TRD or mercedes AMG. Walkinshaw is the same thing thats done here in the states with saleen and their mustangs.  You don't go buy a holden , give it to them , and they give you back an upgraded holden. THEY go buy a holden , and build you a walkinshaw. 

>My original statement and logic is coherent throughout our discussion.

I agree that its legal , I can not agree that its regular.

"When it gets too easy to make money, that’s when u may want to park some of your cash elsewhere.  The FANGS are steady but boring, so u make 50% in year? Boring, but steady.  

We are still in the early stages of a Bitcoin bubble, think lots more to go. But don’t expect a steady ride. Sorry to say there are people out here that are out for blood, they’re called traders. Most of them go by the name of C++.  They have no mercy.  

So diversify.   Just a tip. :-)

And do your yoga of course.  But I digress from the topic at hand.

"> You are admitting point blank that prices go up more than inflation. Ergo, inflation statistics don't reflect actual inflation.

There's a difference between a price increase and inflation. If you use ""inflation"" to describe any price increase you really lose the ability to distinguish between an overall increase in prices as a result of monetary inflation and specific increase in prices due to supply and demand.

>Your argument is ""it goes up because of inflation, and inflation goes up because it goes up.""

That's not my argument.

Inflation of the money supply gradually increases the amount of money available for all goods and services in the economy. This has the overall effect of making each dollar worth less but it increases the overall number of dollars.

You can calculate this effect because its evenly distributed because every dollar is diluted by the same amount.

This is separate from supply and demand for a specific good or service. Every single good has hundreds of factors going into demand and supply that decide the price, there's no way you can just say its all inflation.

If all the price changes in fixed assets like property come from inflation, not supply and demand, then why is it that some places property skyrockets in value and other places it plummets? If its all down to inflation then it should be a even effect because the whole country is running on the same money supply.";1;1;False;suninabox;dpxlsci;Old but I will never get tired of it;7d7a3o;https://i.redd.it/12m1n65fg7yz.jpg
">Because it is my view that the only reason that fixed assets, as a median, increase in price is because of inflation.

Okay, that's a good testable claim. So what is happening when fixed assets increase in price above the rate of inflation? In my humble opinion the fact that the cost of fixed assets are rising much faster than the rate of inflation shows that this is not the only reason, and in fact adjusting for inflation allows you to see what the rise is when you take inflation out of the picture.

Obviously you think there's some other explanation.

>Why would rent go up? Yet again, my point.

I would have an easier time finding your point if you just outright said it rather than implying it with rhetorical questions.

To give my own answer without trying to guess what you think, rents go up because demand increases for a finite supply of desirable living spaces. There's very high demand for living spaces in a few areas that are already very densely populated. As people generate more forms of other wealth, they can bid up the prices of fixed assets.

Agglomeration effects make the supply and demand problem worse. People don't want to live where no other people live, so the more people concentrate in cities the greater the demand for city space and the lower the demand for other places.

I assert there is no difference.  You are trying to make something more complex than it is.  Has the price gone up for the same asset?  Inflation.  When the same house, falling into further and further disrepair, keeps going up in price, and wages have not, then clearly there is something wrong with your metric.

">I assert there is no difference. You are trying to make something more complex than it is. Has the price gone up for the same asset? Inflation.

Are you saying that there would be no difference in the price of houses depending if one year they build 200,000 new houses and another year they build 0, or one year there are a million new immigrants looking for somewhere to live and another year there are none?

Of course supply and demand has an effect.

Calling all of that ""inflation"" is just uselessly broad. It doesn't describe anything in useful detail and just serves to rob inflation of its useful meaning which is describing overall increases in prices due to monetary inflation.

>Just looks like a bunch of tangets to me. You are only trying to insert edge cases in order to confuse the issue.

Saying economics is more complicated than inflation being for all price changes and that supply and demand are different for every good is not an ""edge case""

>When the same house, falling into further and further disrepair, keeps going up in price, and wages have not, then clearly there is something wrong with your metric.

I already explained its because the land the house is sitting on is getting more valuable, combined with the fact the dollar is getting less valuable because the supply has increased. 

The house itself is worth less. If you moved that house to a place with the same land values as when it was first built then no one would be willing to pay as much for it. But its not practical to actually move houses, which is why the issue gets confused of whether you're paying for the house or the land.";1;1;False;suninabox;dpxmg7u;Old but I will never get tired of it;7d7a3o;https://i.redd.it/12m1n65fg7yz.jpg

">If you argue that the depreciation of fiat makes it attractive to spend, it also means that it is unattractive to receive. This is why demand has to be created via legal tender laws.

Day to day currency is not held long enough for this to discourage anyone from accepting dollars. 

Most people spend their entire paycheck the month they get it. There is no noticeable depreciation in value from one month to the next. Anything that they don't spend can be put into an investment fund.

What it does discourage is people thinking that holding onto dollars and doing nothing with them is somehow going to make them rich. Currency has no use unless its facilitating trade. 

If you want to make money from dollars you have to invest them in something that makes money. You can't just hold them and hope other peoples work makes you rich.

>A merchant has an incentive to give a discount for a deflationary asset (even bigger discount when there is no risk of fraudulent chargeback)

If a merchant wants a deflationary asset they can just buy it with fiat. There's no reason to give a discount because trading happens day to day and the difference from one day to the other is not significant. Amortized cost of chargebacks does not anywhere near approach the increased transaction fees. 

There's nothing stopping people from simply saving deflationary assets and spending inflationary currency. If someone has gold and dollars they spend the dollars and keep the gold, which is what killed off gold as a currency. Gold didn't stop going up in value. ""people will accept bitcoin because it goes up in value"" is not what makes a currency.

> It is both. The Schroedinger metaphor does not apply since both properties are not mutually exclusive.

What makes a good speculative asset is mutually exclusive with what makes a good currency.

By definition a speculative asset is something you want to hold over a long period of time as it increases in value. Currency is something you need to spend day to day. You can't simultaneously incentivize two diametrically opposed activities (spending and saving).

>Governments rarely act purely in the interest of the governed. If central-bank fiat money was clearly superior than alternatives, governments would allow free banking.

They act in their own interests. Governments want to be rich. If having gold based currency actually made people richer than the alternative, why would they be against it? They have the power to tax, so they could just tax the extra wealth generated. Why would they care where it came from if it made them richer overall?

It requires a very convoluted explanation of how every nation on earth somehow conspired against its own interests and deliberately made itself poorer because of some ideological opposition to the gold standard.

You're the one who brought up tangents dude.  The only thing I've seen is that you intentionally try and confuse an issue because you don't like, and can't refute, the arguments being presented.  Notice how suddenly the rent increase argument has disappeared?  Because that is the exact issue, and suddenly it's not important because it directly contradicts your assertions.

"> So what is happening when fixed assets increase in price above the rate of inflation? 

The statistical rate of inflation isn't actually the rate of inflation.  It has long been my contention that the statistical rate of inflation is not reflected in reality, and is simply used as a method of governments hiding the cost of inflationary policy.

> > Why would rent go up? Yet again, my point.

But that's it dude.  It's that key point that you're glossing over.  Your argument is ""it goes up because of inflation, and inflation goes up because it goes up.""  It's a circle.  The only thing you've got is a desire to reference your belief structure against an inflating framework.  Take away that framework, and the justification for increasing prices goes away.  

Unless, as I stated, you're actually delivering a better good or service than what already exists.  Then, you get a price increase over existing goods or services, because those have an increased value than the predecessor.  And that is an increase in productivity.

What do you think happens when interest rates do not incentivize savings, but actually heavily incentivizes spending (especially consumer spending)?

Gold was used as a currency for many years, so it is less terrible than the alternatives.

> when they want to explain away how its a currency if everyone just sits on it and doesn't spend it.

If you argue that the depreciation of fiat makes it attractive to spend, it also means that it is unattractive to receive. This is why demand has to be created via legal tender laws.

A merchant has an incentive to give a discount for a deflationary asset (even bigger discount when there is no risk of fraudulent chargeback). You can argue that the consumption pattern of bitcoiners is different than that of non-bitcoiners, but they also have economic activity.

Depends on your metric. If you're talking 0-60 or redlight racing then yes. There are a few other things Tesla takes like cost, practicality and giant center display. If you put the Tesla on a track with curves it's going to get spanked by a Focus RS (TBF it's a nice car). If you're talking curb appeal, interior quality, sound, overall performance, looks then the Lambo is better and it's not even close. I thank Tesla for all they are doing even though I don't own one but in 20 years the world will be flooded with self driving electric cars.

"Exactly. Fuck, say you bet everything on a Bitcoin gambling site. No way they can subpoena a dodgy Russian business looking for evidence. It really is the Wild West here. Unless you fuck up and admit to a judge you have coins on a paper wallet or Trezor no one can ever prove you wrong (yet). If it did get that ugly that you're looking like you're going to lose half or more of your hard earned stack of coins - then a tumbling service is your best friend. Then, at worst they could subpoena Coinbase, prove your purchases, follow them in the Blockchain until they hit that big muthafucka of a wall at the tumbling service- no tracking coins from that point on.

"It could be either. BTC would either dip or go up depending on what people would do with the fork. My guess is the fork itself won’t have any real impact, but BCH could take advantage and launch another pump and dump to again attempt and crash BTC.
