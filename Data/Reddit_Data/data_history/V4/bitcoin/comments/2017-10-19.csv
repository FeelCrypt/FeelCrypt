Or were too busy spending it on the darknet...as was my case in 2012. I don't regret my purchases, I just wish I hadn't been so greedy and short-sighted: I had the opportunity to purchase bitcoin when it was 8-12 dollars per coin. This was only 5 years ago, for crying out loud QQ. Nevertheless, the currency remains very young: I would't expect the same returns from 2012-2017 over the next 5 years (where the value went up by about 700-fold), but I would still expect some really crazy increases, far beyond the realm of most investments. However, bitcoin certainly always carries the risk of going to 0, or near there, unlike commodities, which always have a base value.

"> I mean some points of interest here include that the coin itself is also a fiat currency. In the market of cryptocurrency it's sort of acts like a commodity, but if we want to treat it like a currency than it is a fiat currency as well. It has zero intrinsic value which is what the definition of a fiat currency is. Regardless, you are either speculating in a commodity Market or in a currency Market like the forex. And there is always money to be made in currency markets but to imply that there's no risk is just silly.

Bitcoin is most certainly NOT fiat. Fiat money is ""intrinsically valueless money used as money **because of government decree**"". No one is forcing you to use bitcoin. And bitcoin is only intrinsically valueless in the sense that everything else in existence, e.g. gold, is. The fact that it's virtual or ""not backed by gold"" doesn't make it valueless. It's value is derived from it's properties (and people finding those useful). Open. Permissionless. Decentralized. Global. Virtually instant. This stuff has utility and thus *real value*.

There is of course risk in bitcoin, but I'm arguing that it's comically low at this point. Absolutely and especially relatively to the rewards. I'd say the biggest risk factor is the social aspect. Stuff like S2X for example. Takeover through ignorance & stupidity of plebs. But the current attempt seems to be failing... yet again.

> Buying and holding looks like a good strategy now because the Market has yet to do one of the two things that it will do eventually. It will either crash or it will Plateau. Or both. What's your plateaus and only gains 3% value per year... In this case, you are barely beating inflation and probably losing to a bond market and absolutely losing to a stock market in terms of average returns.

Bitcoin will only really crash if it suddenly loses its utility. How would you imagine that to happen? All governments globally banning it with hard punishments? Yeah right... Even then they can't stop it without shutting down literally everything. Bitcoin would just evolve to adapt to that environment.

Eventually bitcoin will ensure a slow and steady price deflation rate. As long as people lose bitcoin and/or the human population increases it will slowly gain value. It will gradually become less of an investment opportunity and more store of value... and virtually perfect money.

> This is why diversification is important. It's not just about crashes but also about plateaus. Holding some crypto is a fine idea as a hedge. I hold some. But you nor anyone else knows exactly where this thing is going. It might hit 10 billion dollars per coin in value and then crashed to a penny. It might go to $10,000 and never move again. Anything is just speculation. Anyone who says they know for sure is lying. You can make the same arguments about Enron stock because for a long time it was just going up and up and up.

I also don't *know* that I would fall to my death if I jump out a fifth floor window. But I sure do act like I would. Just because there's uncertainty doesn't mean that every scenario is equally likely. Anyone who says they absolutely know what'll happen is lying, yes. But not everyone who's assigning extreme likelyhoods to certain scenarios is.

Bitcoin is not a stock. Repeatedly comparing it to one is pointing to the reason you find my position absurd or extreme: you haven't really conquered bitcoin intellectually yet. That might sound like an insult, but really isn't meant as one. It's a process that simply takes some time. I know, your bullshit radar is beeping again. Understandably so, but it's a false positive you'll eventually recognize as such.

> If you want your whole Investment Portfolio to be crypto I at least hope you are diversifying between the different currencies. You are playing a high-risk high-reward game. If you make a few million dollars you're going to feel like you made the right choice. If you lose everything you're going to feel like you made the wrong choice. It's a fun game to play as long as you realize that there is a massive amount of risk investing in what is effectively a currency exchange without further diversification.

I'm not and advertising for altcoins in this way is to me another indicator you have still stuff to learn about this space. Well, I do own a small amount of litecoin but more as a novelty. Sure, I could've made a killing with Ethereum if I hadn't decided, based on my understanding of it and the criticisms I read, to not invest. But with Ethereum it would've always been about finding the right time to exit with huge profits. Pure speculation. Getting in front of the greater fools. Not my cup of tea. Bitcoin on the other hand *is* the exit to me.

I have lost what to me are huge amounts of money in the years after the 2013 bubble (on paper). And it still felt like making the right choice when I acquired more at <$300 levels instead of thinking about minimizing losses.

Bitcoin loses it's perceived risk very quickly the better you understand it. Once we deal with the social attack vectors and bitcoin is properly inoculated, I guess the biggest risk factor that remains are governments managing to fix the whole financial system and everything that's wrong with it by themselves, thus making bitcoin somewhat redundant and unnecessary. I feel confident that this is not going to happen.

Anyway, I recognize that there's also the possibility that I've gone mad. My (obviously biased) assessment is that this has a low probability :) ... I believe I 'get' something many many other people don't quite get yet. And I'm putting my money where my mouth is.

"You cannot compare gold or any other commodity to bitcoin because those Commodities do have intrinsic value which will keep their price at some minimum level. Gold has value because it is used for in manufacturing and even if people stopped liking it because it's shiny and the price went down, manufacturers would just continue to use it for more and more industrial purposes. Similarly all Commodities have intrinsic value because they are either precious metals that can be used in manufacturing or food items which can be eaten. Bitcoin has neither.

Personally, I think that because Bitcoin is going to be a deflationary currency is the exact reason it's going to be a piss poor currency and terrible money. It's going to act more like a commodity.

My hypothesis is that if cryptocurrency does take off Bitcoin will be like gold is to money today. People will spend ethereum or Litecoin or tezos, and Benchmark those off the value of Bitcoin. And that's best case scenario.

My question for you is this: why is Bitcoin the end? Why not any other coin? Is it not possible that a newer coin comes out and solves many of the problems that Bitcoin currently has? 

My main criticisms of Bitcoin as a currency include that because it is deflationary it won't work very well as money. It will work as a commodity. and as such all investment is just speculation against future value. Additionally, because it is proof of work, it has already centralized itself. It is supposed to be a democratic currency but instead the entirety of Bitcoin is controlled by roughly 5 cartels. 

I think crypto is the future... At least I hope it is. but I want a better coin than Bitcoin. It was the first, but that doesn't make it the best.

Similarly all Commodities have intrinsic value because they are either precious metals that can be used in manufacturing or food items which can be eaten. Bitcoin has neither.

Intrinsic value in the strictest sense doesn't exist. Gold, and anything else really, is only valuable because it's useful to someone. Even food has no value for someone trying to kill himself.

If at some point gold stops being useful and/or people stop associating it with prosperity it will be effectively worthless. Aside from industry and jewelry, part of its use also comes from its long history as a reliable store of value and the expectation that this will continue to be the case. But the fact that you can hold gold in your hand doesn't make it more valueable than immaterial things like information.

Bitcoin is scarce and it's useful to many people. Therefore it has value. It can also lose that value just as gold can lose its. But I don't think it will stop being scarce or useful any time soon.

> My hypothesis is that if cryptocurrency does take off Bitcoin will be like gold is to money today. People will spend ethereum or Litecoin or tezos, and Benchmark those off the value of Bitcoin. And that's best case scenario.

Why would you trade your bitcoin for Ethereum, Litecoin or Tezos? Bitcoin is perfectly suitable as a currency (when we have the transactional capacity to support it). But it will invert a couple of things. The economy will be less debt based and more equity based. Deflation is only bad for people in debt. If you as a merchant can rely on money increasing in value, you might to start to factor that into your prices. People still need to buy stuff, even with money that appreciates in value. At some point a discount is simply high enough to facilitate the trade.

> My question for you is this: why is Bitcoin the end? Why not any other coin? Is it not possible that a newer coin comes out and solves many of the problems that Bitcoin currently has?

Sure, but why should it start from scratch? The coin that will eventually dethrone bitcoin (probably bitcoin v2) will be based off of bitcoins ledger because nothing else makes sense. The moment you establish that the dominating value token can be replaced with an entirely new ledger, it completely shatters the idea of cryptocurrency as a store of value. Because the next replacement might already be around the corner -- so why invest at all?

Bitcoin is the first and the biggest and it is backing every other altcoin out there. Altcoins are mostly pump & dump extravaganzas. Scams left and right. There are only a handful that have something to offer.

People will try to dethrone bitcoin and they will fail again and again. Every attempt made it harder to succeed and I'm confident we passed the point of no return here.

"Hi, your head is up your ass.  Explain to me how a person can't invest a million in index funds, draw 4% annually, and chill out and be an artist if that's what they want to do.  40k after taxes is maybe 30k-ish; I live in my own apartment on the west coast, eat out all the time and buy bullshit I don't need, and my living expenses still don't crack 24k in a year.  And there is no shortage of midwest states where I could do the same probably on 16k or less.

Now if you want champagne and monthly cruises, it might not do... golly, you might need 2 million to sustain that lifestyle.

Clearly you've been around a lot of money and you probably have had a lot of lifestyle creep.  But there is no barrier to making your $1M your permanent 'fuck you' fund if you wanted to.

"> Well, what is stopping you from producing creative youtube videos on the side for fun right now? Would that still exist with a ton of cash under you? Similar with starting exchanges/hedge funds - it would require dealing with the same legal issues as now.

You are confusing your desire for monetary freedom with the freedom you desire from your emotions. Yes if you had more money you wouldn't have to go to the job where you feel bad, but the job is not the cause - it is just the context for your unbalanced emotions. It also isn't good to attach high emotions to money, because if that money were to be lost you would feel down in an equal an opposite way. The only way to beat your situation is to learn to to be neutral about your hardships. One of the best ways to do this may be mediations, learning to be more equanimous.

It's a shame though: his political leanings are strong, but I wouldn't take is financial advice personally. Gold is a shiny piece of metal that will be a mockery by the end of this century...that fact that we still invest in precious metals as a species like it's the second coming of Christ is really strange. Bitcoin has value because it works through the internet, which itself has ENORMOUS value, and that is not illsury...it's a communication media that has revolutionized our ability to interact with one another. Gold makes pretty objects and bricks...you can talk about it, but you can't talk TO it: that's why bitcoin is amazing. We're interacting with total strangers in a very trusting manner through the blockchain (and, to a lesser extent, through our beloved social media: reddit).

">what percentage value would give you confidence that bitcoin wasn't just a speculative-asset bubble (wholly, i.e. back to 5 cents a coin), i.e. that it was actually a useful, global currency? Is there such a percentage?

You can't come up with a precise figure because economies are dynamic systems. for example, volatility caused by speculation actively disrupts utility of the currency so you can't say exactly how valuable it would be without that volatility until you remove it. Sufficed to say that in a system where 90%+ of bitcoin users are using it as a speculative asset, not a currency, you can safely say that most of the current value is based on speculation.

> Also, why does Metcalfe's Law not hold?

There are many reasons its not applicable. 

-bitcoins price is currently far exceeding what metcalfes law says so the idea its somehow predictive of bitcoins increase in value is demonstrably false

-there's no evidence that Metcalfe's law applies to currencies and commodities just because they happen to share some similarities as a network. There are obvious and significant differences that means you can't just treat them as a telecoms network.

-Even if Metcalfe's law applied to a currency as much as a telephone network, its a complete misunderstanding of metcalfes law to think that the ""value"" being talked about is the monetary value of each node of the network. The overall value of the network does not map to the value of the individual nodes. A phone network of 1,000 people is exponentially more valuable than a phone network of 100. That doesn't mean you could sell each phone for exponentially more. That's not how economics works. The economies of scale mean that each phone becomes cheaper. The economies of scale of bitcoin production would make bitcoin cheaper if it was designed to be inflationary rather than deflationary. 

-even in the field of telecoms, where it was designed to apply, it is not some unbreakable law as the name suggests, but [a general trend that doesn't always hold](https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/networks/metcalfes-law-is-wrong)

-people simply buying bitcoin to speculate on does not add a ""node"" to the network in the same way that adding a phone to the phone network does. If the person isn't buying things in bitcoin, or selling things in bitcoin, then its not a functional node, its a static asset. the only thing the vast majority of bitcoin users buy and sell is dollars (or equivalent native currency). There are far more ""nodes"" buying and selling soybeans than bitcoins, but there is no soybean currency network because none of those people are using it as a currency they're just buying and sell

If anything, it is Putin who should be laughing these days.  And to suggest that Russians are backwards at data analysis or cyber security is naive.  Look what Vitalik was able to accomplish on his own, and than imagine how many resources Putin can point at this project.

* A.  Putin is bluffing some bullshit
* B.  Putin has a plan to acquire marketshare in crypto
