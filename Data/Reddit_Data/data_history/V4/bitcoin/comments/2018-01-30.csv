"FSF activists want real software _freedom_, not just free (as in beer) software. it does not matter how much money a person or company spends making the software - it’s morally wrong to release it without adhering to the four freedoms per Stallman.

Linux is a very bright and influential person, but he helps develop maybe 10% of what the modern “Linux” operating system is composed of, and should not be the only person in the room whose opinion is considered.

Lol. There are a fuck ton of promising altcoins that have reached a pretty sizeable marketshare that are still under a dollar. I'm not going to list what I'm invested in specifically, but I've established a set of criteria for white papers and for stated directions that I see value in. I don't see a need to mention them here because I'm just trying to encourage people to do more research into crypto in order to take advantage of the opportunity that is still out there and not be so down on missing the btc rise. Crypto will change the world, just like computers did. Crypto will be ubiquitous like computers are, but it will be in ways no one can predict yet. Learn about some of these possibilities, invest in the possibilities that pursue endeavors you find worth investing in, and take an educated risk. Hedge that risk with other things, and hope your decisions net you enough value to live the life you want.

There's no need to have a repeat of the 1920's because people get swept up in the fever. Don't focus on being rich tomorrow. Money comes and goes, but real wealth takes time, attention, and patience. 

So however much the 10-15 cryptos each person considers buying is up to them based on their personal financial situation, and all I can advocate is doing that responsibly with the understanding that putting aside a little bit frequently and in a lot of places is more likely to make you wealthy than thinking you can out-trade the market. And to be fair, some people can, but unless you have the resources and influence to do that, dreams of buying an altcoins today at a penny and then having it buy you a house in a month is toxic and unrealistic.";1;1;False;eitauisunity;dth012y;The Free Software Foundation has received a 91.45 Bitcoin donation from the Pineapple Fund.

"Actually, I'm more frustrated with the mobile landscape. If you want to use Linux on a desktop, it's never been easier. I split my desktop time in roughly quarters (Windows 10, Mac OS, Ubuntu, Chrome OS). I think Linux is going to have a hard time making inroads on the desktop/laptop at this point simply because it's a market that isn't growing (and is probably shrinking). Linux isn't going to take over in most workplaces (bleeding-edge tech companies like Google notwithstanding), the only place left is consumers, and they're shifting away from the desktop.

So back to my original point, if you want to use a ""free"" operating system on mobile, it's practically impossible. I know that the immediate response is likely ""But Android is Linux!"", but unfortunately Google has their services so intertwined with Android that it becomes practically unusable without them.

Obviously the next answer is ""Well just use Lineage OS then""; so I did. And you know what? Installing it was a living nightmare. Linux on desktop has gotten to the point of just popping in a USB drive with the image, clicking through a few steps, and you have Linux. I *really* know a lot about software, installing OSes, etc. I'm very comfortable with it, and trying to take an Android phone, even one with high compatibility with Lineage OS, over to Lineage was a truly awful experience. That's not a knock at all on the developers/maintainers of that ROM, it's an honest assessment of the mobile landscape. Driver support is terrible, hardware is incredibly closed, standards are followed a lot more loosely, it's just not good.

So the point here is that more and more users are making mobile their main/only computing experience, and yet from an open-source OS platform standpoint, it feels like all the gains on Linux have been lost, and I'm back to trying to install Redhat 6.0 in the late 90s...except maybe even worse, because there isn't nearly the ""we need to support/embrace open hardware/software"" community. It's more like the community just accepts that it sucks. It's a real bummer.";12;1;False;hexydes;dtgwed1;The Free Software Foundation has received a 91.45 Bitcoin donation from the Pineapple Fund.

"The vulkan API could end directx's reign of supremacy though. That would be a good start. 

Then again Microsoft might actually be having some foresight here and is making their titles windows 10 exclusives as well as allowing all current and future Xbox exclusives to run on windows 10 as well. As it is windows has all the inertia so all it would really take is one or two killer apps to keep people tied into windows and get older windows version users to upgrade. 

Then we have stuff like Photoshop, Ableton, FL studio, etc. I know these run on windows and Mac but how about Linux?  Gaming is one massive piece of the puzzle but if all the major productivity software is OSX and Windows and you're stuck finding open source alternatives that's a no-go for many. 

I guess lastly there's just familiarity too. I'm a windows power user and have only lightly dabbled in Linux distros for fun and digital security, and from the bit of basics you'll learn from rooting Android phones and being a power user on that platform too. However a new OS might intrigue me, I know that absolutely none of my gaming friends would be willing to learn a new OS even if the performance was just as good. There would need to be a serious delta in Linux's favor for them to even consider it and I'm sure I'd be on constant tech support helping them adjust.";29;1;False;Tyr808;dtgucbc;The Free Software Foundation has received a 91.45 Bitcoin donation from the Pineapple Fund.

"The 50btc ‘hack’ happened when I was mining with 3 ASICs. It wasn’t that big a deal to lose 91btc at the time because I had hundreds of bitcoin anyway. I had it set to auto payout but the owners fucked off with everyone’s coin and led us on for a long time. They said they’d been hacked and we’d get our coin back but then they just disappeared. 

The mtgox loss was annoying because I sent 27btc to cash then out to my bank account right at the time they disabled withdrawals. I cancelled my fiat withdrawal and tried to get my coins out but it was too late. There is a small chance I will get a percentage of that back some time in the future as I have submitted a claim to the bankruptcy lawyers in Japan. 

This was back in like 2013-2014 so it’s only when I  reminded of these losses that I realise I would literally be a millionaire right now.

Or you can just copy and paste them.

"Well, we can employ any testing and standards we want. 

I half made the comment as a joke but I have been contemplating creating a free hardware network myself using raspberry pi's and other single board computers.

Essentially, since hardware prices are plummeting thanks to products like the raspberry pi, the giver of the ""free"" hardware would eat the initial cost but the hardware would be permanently removed from the profit motive market by using contracts with conditions of use and future exchange. 

Basically, the rule would be once gifted a piece of hardware, the recipient could only give it away on a first come, first served basis (along with any improvements made to it) once they no longer had a need for the device. 

And exchanges could be recorded and tracked online so that a limit of one of each device per real person could be ensured. 

And of course people would be encouraged to build their own ""free"" computers and add them to the free hardware network all the time.

"**Domain Name System**

The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the Internet or a private network. It associates various information with domain names assigned to each of the participating entities. Most prominently, it translates more readily memorized domain names to the numerical IP addresses needed for locating and identifying computer services and devices with the underlying network protocols. By providing a worldwide, distributed directory service, the Domain Name System is an essential component of the functionality on the Internet, that has been in use since 1985.

The major stresses are all in the past these days, but every time I see the mention of bitcoin it solicits a certain response from my brain.

"> exclusionary enlightenment

This statement alone proves that you are from abrahamic religious background and have a very poor understanding of karmic religions, Law of Karma, **TRUTH** and enlightenment.

That being said, clearer minds would provide what is required in the world much faster and efficiently than minds that aren't so. A normal person (rich or poor) has many desires, fears, delusions, hopes, etc etc which distort what is in front of him in many ways. An enlightened being sees what is front of him clearly and does what is necessary. Nothing more, nothing less. You may think that you are helping someone, or you are hurting someone. But without clarity you could be hurting someone without knowing it. So, it is better to become enlightened then go around helping in the world, especially if you are rich.

Of course, I don't think you understand such things. Just keep doing what you are doing. Some people don't deserve to be on the spiritual path.

"No disagreement there. Lots of graphic design work is in the Adobe ecosystem. But I wouldn't consider Adobe's software ""basic programs"" like the comment mentioned. Basic programs would be a web browser, email client, office (word processor, spreadsheets, etc.), basic image editor (think MS Paint or Linux's Pinta), screen-cap utility, media players, even torrent clients or password managers. Basically things the mainstream, non-professional users would be using.

But on the graphics side Linux has GIMP for Photoshop needs. I've used both, prefer Photoshop because it's what I am/was most used to and has a some more built in advanced features, but GIMP is incredibly customizable and full of extensions. The amount of customization available makes it a really powerful tool. I'd say it's more then adequate for hobbyists or a regular user that wants a little more oomph than a paint program. Inkscape does vector graphics like Adobe Illustrator, similar story as GIMP vs Photoshop as far as replacements go. Plus 3D rendering has Blender and even Autodesk Maya.

The poor are just a statistic for them. But once you are self realized, you will see that everything is one only. Sharing wealth or knowledge won't be a problem then.

So, to summarize, if you want to quickly remove poverty, spiritual development of the rich is the shortest and the best way.

"Yup, aware of Lineage OS being based on AOSP. Android is a great OS, just like Windows is a great OS; the problem, like I said, is that in order to use a Google-variant of Android, you have Google Play Services so deeply-tied into the OS, that you can't really get rid of it, short of building a new ""distro"" based on AOSP. I would want to use an AOSP version of the OS because Google is coming to a point of having so much information about people that it's actually very scary from a privacy standpoint. Even if Google is completely altruistic, there are legal requirements that might necessitate them opening up a LOT of information about people.

I don't have a problem with AOSP-based OSes, but I really have had a different experience than you in getting an OS loaded. Locked bootloaders, caveats about various parts of the hardware not running, having to tether and run things in debug mode on the phone, having to dig through hundreds of different ROMs to find one that matches your device...none of that is a reasonable expectation of a normal user.

"Doesn't matter how much you put in since % gain is the same. If you put in 100 and it grows 10x, then you have $1000; if you put $1000 it grows 10x then you have $10,000, and so on. So just start wherever you're comfortable.

r/cryptocurrency is a good resource, though at times it seems that the users forget that noobs exist and we would shouldn't expect them to know everything we take for granted. If you could find someone willing to help that would be great, otherwise start by first reading into what cryptocurrencies actually are and how they work (things like block chains, private/public keys, wallets, transactions), then figure out how to get money in the system (if you are US based, then coinbase is the most popular option, though they get a lot of criticism because their customer service can't keep up with the influx of new users). Once your money is in coinbase, then you can purchase one of their crypto offerings (Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash). Other cryptos that you would want will be listed on other exchanges, so to get those you will need to purchase Ether (or bitcoin) from coinbase, send it to another exchange, and trade for the crypto that you want. 

If you're also at the point where this all makes sense and you want investing advice, I can suggest some ""blue chip"" cryptos that have more dominant positioning in the market. Of course nothing is a sure thing, especially with an industry so young, but the one certainty is that the technology will revolutionize different industries. You can play it ""safe"" by betting on the companies with certain advantages that give higher likelihoods of disrupting the industry, or you can bet on the less popular coins and hope that the one you choose will reward you with 10x or 100x (these we refer to as ""shitcoins"").

"I'm in a similar boat. When btc hit 10k all I could think about was how different  my life would be if I held, but I had no way of knowing what it would be, and what the actual implications of crypto would be.

The good news is that btc isn't the end all be all of crypto. We're living in a time where the lightbulb was just invented and everyone is getting their houses wired for light without realizing the value of the electricity that runs that light. There are plenty of opportunities to make plenty of money if you do your research and spread your risk around.

Think of it like the stock market. The people who ended up jumping out of skyscrapers were the traders. Yeah, everyone hit hard times, but the people who invested in various stocks and just held on to them or didn't think about the massive crash, sure, some of their stocks went under, but they had enough diversification that the winners they picked more than made up for the losers.

I see that crypto might be similar. No one can tell the future, but the technology behind crypto makes automating the various costs of human trade and making them virtually unbound by time, distance, and identity.  Just like manufacturing automated the production of goods, and email automated the sending of information, crypto will automate the financial institutions (among other things). The best part is that it will do it in a decentralized and distributed way.

What I'm saying is there are plenty of opportunities still in this space. Don't get down on yourself about making a completely rational decision with the information you had at the time, and don't let that discourage you from ceasing the vast amount of opportunity that currently exists. Pick 10 or 15 crypto currencies based on what type of niche they fill and make it a financial goal to throw an amount you are willing to lose in each one. Then put them in cold storage and forget about them. Still follow the news and updates about the coins your purchased, but resist the temptation to sell until the day comes where trading them out to be wealthy in fiat is an obsolete concern.

And if they all tank, then you didn't put more into them then you could afford to lose. It's also important to hedge your bets in fiat as well and make other investments.

Whenever you make a Bitcoin investment, you are essentially buying a digital token. Making a Bitcoin investment is currently regarded as a viable investment option. At precisely the same time, if you're likely to earn a Bitcoin investment, you've got to take on significant risk because the digital currency market is extremely unpredictable rather learn to invest in real estate.

"Don't feel bad, there's a lot of confusion and misinformation about open source and free software. It's a surprisingly subtle topic that even confuses experienced lawyers at software companies - I've dealt with some of them.

It's worth reading the text of the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) (really short!) and the [BSD License](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause) (also short) to see what the simplest open source licenses say.

The [Apache license](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) is a bit longer, but still easy to get the gist of on a brief skim. It's similar to the above two in intent, but it adds some features like saying what happens legally if you optionally choose to contribute changes back to the license owner.

If the above were the only kind of open source license, the topic would be much simpler. But licenses like the GPL complicate things by being more ambitious, particularly in regards to the requirement to make the source of your own changes to GPL software freely available. Because of this, the license is longer and more complicated, particularly in v3 which addressed software services provided via networks. Since the license puts more restrictions on users, a larger license is required to define those restrictions and their implications.

Yes and no. Open source is great for those who have knowledge to assert the code. Otherwise you will still have to blindly trust the source. Besides smart person can put backdoor in your open source and obfuscate it so 99% even qualified users won't be able to detect without picking code line by line.

Open source licences *literally* entitles everyone to the product for free forever. So yes I'm asking for those entitlements. And nearly all of the software I use entitles me to all of that too. So what I'm suggesting to OP, is that if he wants to compete with other similar apps that grant those entitlements, and open his app up to a wider audience, he should open-source it.  I'm not trying to beg for something, I'm trying to help OP.

If he is trying to build a business out of this app and doesn't want free help from the community, and has some crazy wonderful proprietary UI features he's trying to keep secret, that's fine too, but he's going to have a harder time.

"There was Bitpesa in parts of Africa, that might be what you're thinking of. But having a wallet and a way to send transactions was only a small part of the issue. You still had to find a way to convert the BTC to cash, and especially in converting amounts like $20-$300 you ended up paying big fees to the money changers, and probably still do today not even considering the network fees. It wasn't that good of a situation then really at all. The spread you pay on the cash to BTC part of the transaction doubled dipped with having to pay the much worse BTC to cash spread in very small markets was bad. If there's no liquidity, even if there's no network fees it's still not great. 

I only remember one company that created what appeared to be a decent situation for Filipino workers in Hong Kong sending home money by acting as the middleman. That was good I guess, but it was just a company that was is/was able to exist because it did a ton of work establishing the channel and then being able to avoid regulation for the time being. Good for them, I applaud their efforts, but that was the rare exception rather than the rule. If Bitcoin was super liquid worldwide with low spreads, it might be a different story. Maybe it actually is now, it was very illiquid worldwide back then with money changers charging big percentage points on the cash outs. Even now, a quick look at localbitcoins and it doesn't look great even now. But back then it was even worse.

I'll reply here to everything

> Is it unethical for the bcash community to represent itself as Bitcoin? A simple yes or no will suffice.

This in itself is a more complex question. If they were attempting to confuse people into believing they were BTC, then the answer would be unquestionably yes. If, however (as I see things from what they're claiming), what they're doing is laying claim to the Bitcoin ideal, ie: ""a p2p electronic cash system"", a currency to let the unbanked be their own bank, to allow everyone to participate in the global economy despite borders and oppressive governments, then I honestly don't see why BTC should have an automatic monopoly on that, or what authority does it claim for it. It seems your argument for BTC to claim such things is based on nothing but authoritarianism, but that's completely against the cypherpunk ideals bitcoin was founded on.

If BTC is undisputably the superior p2p electronic cash system, it should have absolutely nothing to fear from BCH, and, indeed, you would regard it in the same way you regard Bitcoin Gold. But you don't regards it as such, and it's mighty telling. And you get terribly angry and call me a shill when I point out that you seem unable to point out the actual difference between Gold and BCH in the way they're marketed, and yet, you double down on it.

This is what blockchain tech brought us; permissionless systems. I understand for some people, going running afoul of the ""authority"" **feels** dishonest and scammy, but you must realize this is your preconditioning, and your fear of change. There is no reason BCH should anger you so if you truly believed BTC to be superior.";1;0;False;forthosethings;dtgc6eu;He's not wrong.;7tn69m;https://i.redd.it/hwj3mu02kvc01.png
