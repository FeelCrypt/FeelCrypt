"> I think the issue is conflating the decreasing rate of supply increase with the change in demand.

That i agree with.

> All else being equal, a slower rate of supply increase shouldn’t increase prices. 

I'm trying to understand your side but I don't get it.

SO let's say that there is constant demand, no new people buying bitcoin, just the same people wanting to buy the same number of coins each day.

If the rate of supply drops to a tiny fraction, let's say 1BTC per day. Then you're saying that won't affect the price?

Or if the supply suddenly jumps up to a billion a day, that won't affect price either? (i'm aware there's only about 21M BTC but you get my point)

Or are you saying that the difference in production supply gets naturally balanced out by people selling existing supply? What about all the coins that simple aren't up for sale?

"Yeah I'm sorry, the earlier post was a bit of an attack rather than a rebuke. But my point was in general, conventional stocks have a million safeguards warning people about the risks in investing. Gambling is shunned by society. Bitcoin is being celebrated, the continual posts come across almost as propaganda, celebrating the price increases and at times causing the next ones. Maybe, this posturing by the community might lead people to have false expectations from bitcoin. Especially desperate people, who don't have a lot to lose.   
As far as not doing something because someone might get hurt, this farrago created by btc and it's owners is actively clouding realities, aiming to profit off of people's ignorance. It's not innocently apathetic towards it.

"Loving the niche examples here, keep em coming. What's next, sending your chemist a fiver every time you pop a boner? You know why those services are paid for? There's no demand for them. It takes someone to go out of their way, programme that into a system to make it happen. Cause nobody gives a shit about you wanting to give your pals an insignificant amount of money according to your whims.  
Your example of transacting money without a middleman or agent, not a central authority, that would be a presiding regulator, mind your ignorance here, is one of the fruits of blockchain tech. Which does not have much to do with bitcoin itself. Btc is just the first crypto originated on the blockchain system. Thats all there is to bitcoin.  
Moreover, blockchain is what should be sought out and developed. The tech bitcoin is based on is revolutionary when it comes to removing transaction costs, which you mentioned. An ideal world would be one where everyone transacts their home currencies on a blockchain system with the Fed controlling the supply.  
Where does that leave us when it comes to bitcoin? Very very low adoption, little intrinsic value, high conversion costs. Most of all, very low utility.

You can research what the blockchain is but I'll try to quickly explain. In essence, it allows for the creation of decentralised services. Bitcoin is the worlds first decentralised currency. It has no owners, no central servers, anyone can chose to participate and join the network. Its peer to peer (no middlemen), permissionless (no gatekeepers), open source (anyone can view the code/ monetary policy).

* the statute of limitations for a lawsuit (class action or otherwise) regarding that is still valid in many locations

* Its now an amount of money that would be interesting for attorneys to pursue

* It would obviously be completely impossible to figure any of that out...

* Theres now motivation to pursue (criminally) for the hack given that its become a crime that would arguably endanger national/international security because its ~$8.5 billion dollars instead of a few mil

* Theres motivation to pursue it because it would further legitimize the BTC market and major exchanges are coming on board (CME/Nasdaq/etc) as well as the entire financial community that likely need or want the market to appear to be at least somewhat legitimate

* Further motivation because its a theft of ~$8.5 billion dollars of a currency which is supposedly used mostly by ""criminals and money launderers"" (as opposed to just cash obviously because its much cleaner... 90% of it literally has cocaine residue on the bills themselves)

* A bold move cotton... trying to hide $8.5 bil when even ~$500 transactions are automatically reported by almost all systems... lets see how this pans out

"Explain to me how banks are a ""symptom of the disease of fiat"" when banks certainly existed in America before 1933 when they went off the Gold Standard.

So the Gold Standard failed completly in one of the first times a globe spanning war happened. Even though that was the exact kind of time that according to Fiat haters would say gold would be king. Instead it meant runs on not just banks, but on gold, and leaving people with gold that could no longer be easily exchanged. Of the countries that tried to go back, none of the major ones made it through the great depression with it, and it certainly would not have been able to handle WW II.

"From the recent Change My View thread:

>I understand where you are coming from, but my argument is that to some degree, the greater fool theory is irrelevent and not particularly uncommon even in the accepted stock markets of the world.
Most stocks right now that you buy in companies off things like the New York Stock Exchange do not pay dividends, ie there are not quarterly or annual payouts of profits to stockholding investors. Furthermore, there is nothing necessarily linking stock value to profits. For instance it is entirely possible that a company loses money, but its stock value still goes up anyway. This leads to a certain divorce from reality in some ways. The stock itself is worthless (it pays you nothing), beyond what a 2nd person is willing to pay for it for whatever reason
So why the heck can say Tesla's stock value go up like this over the past year, when during that same time period they have posted losses >$200 million each quarter!? Now you might say, /r/taranaki, its because people think in 10 years Tesla might be making large profits. Sure. Except I would also say, in such a scenario, is that piece of (now electronic) paper that sits in your vault paying you any more money w/ the company making millions in profits versus millions in losses? They answer is NO! Its still paying out $0 in dividends. In fact its only value is that now other people will want to buy the stock, and then sell it to someone else on the thought they will expect SOMEONE ELSE to want it for more money if quarterly reports look good. Why!? Because thats just what people are ""supposed to do"". But implicitly if someone declared tomorrow stocks can no longer be traded, then you still have a worthless piece of paper in a profit or loss scenario(because it doesnt pay dividends).
Do you kind of get the shell game that goes on in real stocks? Its the exact same speculation that goes on w/ bitcoin. People want bitcoin, because they believe that other people will want it based on the thought it will keep going up. People want Tesla stock on the thought that OTHER people will want it due to the thought that if earnings go up a 3rd person will want it for even more (even though increased earnings in a vacuum doesnt help or hurt the owner of the stock if he cant trade it to a 3rd party)

It's dealt as a bankruptcy. A trustee was appointed years ago and over 20,000 claimants had their claims accepted. People who didn't submit their claims are out of luck now.

Also, in my experience people tend to ask about wages and rent. I don't ask people, but I assume that if someone asks then they are comfortable sharing as well. Might be a small cultural difference though, since I'm not in the US.

Though personally if I won the lottery I wouldn't tell anyone, unless/until I did something that required an explanation. Which I might not do anyway.

"Why would backing make it stable? It’s not as if there is inherent stability to the valuation of a backing instrument. All money is based on the appraisal of some item’s value in aggregate, whether the item is a specific mass of a precious metal, a specific volume of petroleum, a specific quantity of special paper, or a digital representation of same.

The idea that backing a financial instrument with an asset makes the instrument value more stable than an alternative instrument backed by wishes and promises is provably false, and based mostly on a gut instinct that THINGS have REAL VALUE which is also provably false.

"I deliberately simplified the hell out of it to make it easier for people to understand.

Obviously there is far more to stock valuation than the assets over liabilities, the purpose was to reflect that a cash dividend reflects an asset which the shareholders already own either way.

You're nitpicking, and doing so badly.

As for liquidation, normally it occurs involuntarily with failing companies which is why the shareholders being at the end of the line matters. E = A - L, if L > A then yeah, the shareholders don't get shit. But if a successful company were to decide to liquidate overnight then they're absolutely going to get the net assets over liabilities. The only thing they wouldn't get is the value of the future revenue streams.

A company can be viewed as a combined asset (net assets in excess of liabilities) and future revenue stream. Whether the revenue stream is set to automatically reinvest or not is irrelevant.

"That's completely incorrect. I'm not even quite sure where to start...

When you pay for that coffee, you create and broadcast a transaction which says you want to move some Bitcoin to Starbucks' address. No funds actually move anywhere until a miner includes that in a block, which could take weeks depending on congestion and the fee you've set (it may even *never* be included if miners ignore it).

The Bitcoin does not sit in the mempool, the transaction does. Your client software will make everything look pretty by subtracting that amount from your balance and making sure not to spend those specific Bitcoin in another transaction, but they're still certainly under your control. 

You could walk outside the coffee shop and create another transaction which spends those *same* Bitcoin to a different address, such as another of your own. If a miner includes that transaction instead of the one to Starbucks, then you keep the money and Starbucks gets nothing.

"That's dumb as hell. The reason companies don't need to pay out dividends is because the ownership of the share represents incorporates the dividends.

Let's say you own 1% of Company A. Company A has assets worth $100,000 and your share is valued at $1,000 (this is a super simple example). If Company A has revenues of $1,000 then they could give each of their 100 shareholders $10 and continue to be worth $100,000. That's a dividend. But if they don't declare the dividend then they now have assets of $101,000, and you still own 1% of the company. Your share is now worth $1,010. You can simply sell 1% of your share and give yourself an effective dividend, getting your $10 and keeping your holdings steady at $1,000.

When you buy stocks you're buying a share of ownership in an enterprise, ideally a successful one. When it succeeds it doesn't matter whether they give you cash or whether they roll that cash back into the company, you own a share of that cash anyway.

It's nothing to do with Greater Fool Theory. Netflix has never paid dividends but if you were to offer to pay a Netflix shareholder twice what he paid for his shares five years ago you would not be a greater fool.

"For one, this isn't really a solid proof or reason that bitcoin isn't speculation (or that speculation is a solid investment), since it effectively just say ""what about stocks?"". It doesn't attempt to explain why something could be a solid investment and not a bubble even if there is no inherent value to anyone, it just says that stocks are just as much of a bubble.  
Secondly, there is clearly a fundamental misunderstanding of stocks. Stocks are a share of a company, a percentage of ownership. Even if that ownership doesn't pay dividends or even grant voting rights. In the worst case scenario of a company going bankrupt, you own a portion of that companies assets, and will be able to collect a percentage of their assets after debts are paid. Yes, stock prices can fluctuate independently of the companies profitability, because people speculate on stocks as they do any other investment, but speculating that the companies profits will go up is completely different from speculating on something with no inherent value. Speculating on a companies value can be an informed decision based on facts that the company will grow, and it can be right most of the time for everyone who speculates it because the whole economy grows and each individual company grows with it. Speculating on something without inherent value is what's called a bubble, you are speculating only that ""some greater fool"" will be willing to pay more than you did in the future, and is inherently unsustainable because eventually, when there is no greater fool with enough money to meaningfully effect the price, all the people who only ""invested"" in speculating that others would pay more will sell, since that was their intention all along. There is no point at which such a thing would happen for a companies stocks unless the company went bankrupt, in which case stockholders are at least entitles to a percentage of the companies assets and so there is still a price floor to which the stock will drop.  
All of this is not to say that bitcoin is a bad investment, to be clear, this is just a particularly bad argument for investing in bitcoins. Bitcoin does have inherent value for trading, but if you believe that the majority of bitcoins valuation is speculation on bitcoins valuation, you should recognize that that is a bubble (which seems like a pretty sound hypotheses to me given its meteoric rise in price which I would guess is primarily caused by a scarcity caused by people investing in bitcoin, but I don't know the actual transaction rates and thus demand for BTC as currency which is inherently valuable)";2;0;False;Valectar;dqkarz4;I hope James is doing well;7gla05;https://i.redd.it/h4ngqma643101.jpg

"That question is dependent upon how quickly you need the transaction to be moved from the mempool to the blockchain, or how fast the transaction needs to be on the blockchain ledger. The higher the fee the faster it will be mined onto the blockchain. If I needed to send my mom $100 right now and I decided to do it in Bitcoin, but she is okay with it being in her wallet by 6pm tonight, and it is currently almost 3pm where I am. Currently the blockchain is averaging 8.43 minutes per block. This means between now and 6pm there will be roughly 21 blocks mined that my transaction could go on. Thus, I could probably put a $1.50 fee on the transaction and it would be in her wallet by 6pm at the latest. If I needed to get a transaction through instantly, or on the very next mined block, it would be around $4. This would mean the money would be in her wallet and usable after about 8.23 minutes or whenever the next block is mined.  
  
However, the $4 fee is also during a time right now where Bitcoin price has skyrocketed so A LOT of transactions are occurring right now. During a time in which BTC is relatively stable (respective to BTC volatility) the fee could be as low as $1 to be included in the next block.  Currently BTC is working on a way to lower these fees even more so that you would be able to send a transaction for $0.25 that would be included in the next few blocks.

"True story... Literally this exact thing happened to me, but not in the context of bitcoin. I have an ex, started dating after I came back from a Mormon mission for a couple years in South Africa, so I was 22 years old at the time. We even got engaged after about 10 months of dating. Then, 2 months into the engagement, she cheats on me and says, ""I just want someone with more ambition I guess. You're just a programmer. Sorry."" Knowing her, what this really meant was she thought I was too much of a computer geek, my Computer Science degree I was enrolled in (and molecular and cellular biology double major) was not going to make as much money as a ""business"" guy, of what she kept telling me I should really be doing.

Well that was it. Queue some years later, I finish grad school, I am working solidly in computational biology, I'm published, I'm making 6 figures, and my position at my company is Chief Technology Officer (CTO) on my LinkedIn, and she messages me saying BS like we should catch up, she's in town, she'd love to see me and then trying to throw in little memories of old times. Note, I am married now with kids and she is married with a kid, and she hasn't talked to me in years but has the balls to say and I quote, roughly, ""Things are pretty rough. [Name of husband] and I haven't been getting along, and he got diagnosed with cancer and I have been having a hard time with it. He doesn't seem interested in going for promotions anymore at work. I am so impressed with how well you are doing. You are so smart and funny. Want to catch up? You can call me at [X] time as my husband won't be home then.""

Somehow she thought that would make me want to call her lol. Ya, I did not ever meet up with her since, nor did I care to, and she has reached out at least half a dozen times over the last few years. Oh and ya, she doesn't work and doesn't like working. My wife now complains that she doesn't work enough, even though she could stay at home. Who sounds like the person I'd rather be with? lol

This memory hurts my heart.

When Bitcoin hit $100 I said, ""I would buy some at $50 because this is just too expensive right now."" I said the same thing at $500, $1k, and even last month at $6.9k.

This memory hurts my heart.

well, right now its value comes from the borderless and secure means to store and transfer wealth. Bitcoin is my bank.

If that would be how you would play it, then it would only harm your reputation an integrity. You are already in a better spot, so why are you bothered still by small little problems. The only thing this does is shows your insecurities.

It's a currency, with a physical amount of coins available, that have to have actual labor (computer labor) in the process of retrieving them. This first part gives them their value. The second part is our acceptance of them as a currency, making them valuable.;2;0;False;Raydonman;dqk4qlx;I hope James is doing well;7gla05;https://i.redd.it/h4ngqma643101.jpg
"Bitcoin is a digital currency you can use on sites like Overstock.com, Microsoft digital store, Steam (for games), Newegg for computer parts, some other sites and I think a few Subway franchise stores accept it, at least one that I've heard of.

It's a currency where you don't need a middle-man to send or receive. Where most banks will lock down your account if you buy from certain services they don't like, the Bitcoin network doesn't give a shit.

Where fiat (US dollars, euros, etc.) is controlled by a central bank, and they can decide whether a purchase is valid/invalid based on how they feel, Bitcoin is decentralized and transactions are verified using math. As long as 1+1=2, the transaction is valid. (Not entirely exact, but gets the point across hopefully)

You can buy Bitcoin from sites like Coinbase, and use the Bitcoin to pay for it. You can make money from it when the price rises. Holding Bitcoin doesn't get taxed. Selling Bitcoin for profit (or even loss) is taxed.

If you are new to Bitcoin and wondering why it's so valuable, please read this:

Bitcoin’s value derives from its current real uses (mainly for money transfers and remittances) its limited supply and scarcity (store of value) and its many potential uses. Also, behind the curtains there is a huge growth in the bitcoin ecosystem development that a regular folk can't see because it's ignored by the media.
> 
> If you buy for day trading you may lose money, but if you hold long term, it has been proven you get nice ROI. And bitcoin has barely started, think of the Internet/email in the 90's. A decentralized technology that has a valuable use it's not going to disappear, even if a few tyrannical governments try to ""ban"" it.

> Bitcoin is a worldwide-distributed decentralized peer-to-peer censorship-resistant trustless and permissionless deflationary system/currency (see Blockchain technology) backed by mathematics, open source code, cryptography and the most powerful and secure decentralized computational network on the planet, orders of magnitude more powerful than Google and government combined. There is a limit of 21 million bitcoins (divisible into smaller units). ""Backed by Government"" money is not backed by anything and is infinitely printed at will by Central Banks. Bitcoin is limited and decentralized.

"I'm not a 100% clear what you're trying to argue but you're deluded if you think there is intrinsic value in bitcoin. A currency derives value from its ability to act as a means of exchange and because of (or occasionally in spite of) the economic policies that back it up. e.g. inflation targets. It is otherwise useless.

Gold has industrial and cosmetic applications and is relatively rare/expensive to extract for those uses, same as platinum, palladium and other metals. If you're looking for the ""new"" gold you'd be better investing in Helium-3 which we need a lot of but it is increasingly scarce.

Bitcoin - well blockchain - is an interesting tech that has a lot of use, but it is the concept of blockchain that is being used and developed in industry not bitcoin. BTC is proving only that the tech scales (kind of) but should a government of global consortia back a crypto then for mass adoption that'd probably win.

Exchanges have internal databases in order to avoid paying transaction fees for every operation and because it's much faster and convenient, so these transactions can't be counted in the total.

"The fees confuse me so far, is there a minimum fee on each transaction? On my first transaction I bought $20 of bitcoin and it charged me a $1.49, which isn't exactly 1.9% of $20.

Bitcoin is in a league of its own. Its network is tremendously larger than any other cryptocurrency. It has much more vendors willing to accept it than any other cryptocurrency. Its brand is very powerful. Most people don't know what a bitcoin is, but infinitely more people know about bitcoin than about the second biggest cryptocurrency. The Lightning Network will allow bitcoin to scale beautifully. Even microtransactions will be virtually instantaneous and almost free. Most cryptocurrencies aren't ready for mainstream usage, bitcoin is actively working on it. This will create an entirely new industry.;7;1;False;Exotemporal;dqj6v4t;BTC dropping due to lack of quality 11k memes.

We indeed can't differentiate between transactions for goods and services and transactions to exchange bitcoins. The total volume transacted outside of internal transactions at exchanges in the past 24 hours is in excess of 12 billion dollars. Bitcoin as a currency is a secondary use case currently, but this will change once the Lightning Network is implemented, allowing for near instantaneous and extremely cheap transactions. I think the biggest use case currently is an international store of value that's impossible to confiscate or steal if the necessary precautions are taken and that can be carried everywhere with you simply by remembering 12 words. That's incredibly innovative. I hope that it will become a practical currency as soon as possible, but we can't expect a stable price while we're in the adoption phase and while the price is being discovered.;2;1;False;Exotemporal;dqjl7hl;BTC dropping due to lack of quality 11k memes.

Almost every currency has a scaling issue at the moment but it's because excitement is building rapidly and the infrastructure is struggling to keep pace. The currencies that overcome these issues (the ones with strong developers and goals) will be more favored than other coins.

Don't be silly. I spent over 100 bitcoins on goods and services. Buying other cryptocurrencies isn't exactly using bitcoin as a currency. He asked if he should divest in an another cryptocurrency because he wasn't comfortable with today's fluctuations and I told him that he shouldn't, not that he should never spend his bitcoins. Moreover, bitcoin doesn't have to be used as a currency to succeed. Bitcoin is what the users make of it. It's been going strong for 9 years now. When the Lightning Network finally gets implemented, we'll have near instantaneous transactions for extremely low fees. However, as long as bitcoin is unstable, bitcoin as a currency is a secondary use case and we can't expect bitcoin to have a stable price while we're in the adoption and price discovery phases.;1;0;False;Exotemporal;dqjqa36;BTC dropping due to lack of quality 11k memes.

"It's just gambling at this point. If you have 3k you don't need and enjoy gambling on coins more than sports or penny stocks then go for it.

Any coin on the market could easily be worth double or half what it is now in 6 months.

If you actually want to invest your money then you need a diversified portfolio of which a small percentage can be in high-risk high-reward assets like cryptocurrency.

If your dream is to become a millionaire off a 3k investment then you can't gamble on established coins like bitcoin.

Bitcoin has gone from 6 cents to 11k. It's literally impossible for bitcoin to see that kind of rise again, because it would have to hit 2 billion a coin, and that would make the market cap many times more than all wealth on earth.

Or the myspace of social media, or the Netscape Navigator of web browsers, or the Nokia of phones?

Being first to market, and even being market leader is not enough to secure monopoly position in perpetuity, especially in a fast moving innovative sector like technology.

Myspace lost out to Facebook just by having a slightly worse design. It's not like Myspace was fundamentally broken and Facebook came up with a radical improvement, and yet it still lost out even with a massive headstart and network advantage.

Bitcoin is far from being a functional currency yet, and has dozens of competitors based on exactly the same technology. I would be amazed if it was still market leader in 10 years time.

He asked if there's a better cryptocurrency than bitcoin right now. This was just a small dip, we're used to them and it doesn't require any action. Bitcoin has tremendously more computational power securing the network than any other cryptocurrency. No one is claiming to know if bitcoin will still be the gold standard of cryptocurrencies in 20 years, but right now it's in a league of its own and the other cryptocurrencies are tied to what happens to bitcoin. Bitcoin has also been much more peer reviewed and tested than any other cryptocurrency and it has been working for 9 years.

"Bitcoin is an asset which has never existed before.

It is similar to gold.
Supply is finite.
Takes effort and resources to produce.
Functions as a store of value.
Can be used to facilitate commerce.

On this last point, gold isn't widely used anymore, but it once was.

Gold has serious drawbacks. 
Its heavy.
If you want to pay someone in gold you have to do it in person which could be dangerous if they are some rando.  Doing it remotely requires secure transport and some way to guarantee payment.

So here comes bitcoin, a deflationary asset like gold, with the liquidity of credit cards, no dependence on a third party, the ability to transact globally and some privacy (not enough which is one issue with bitcoin).  

The financial sector is having a problem grokking the potential and since its growing so fast, the only other scenario that seems close to what we are seeing are the many many bubbles we have seen over the course of human history.  So people who aren't visionaries are dismissive calling bitcoin tulips and bubbles and claiming every correction is a sign that bitcoin is doomed.

You are absolutely right about mining being an energy suck and the arms race going on can't continue.  I am not sure how that is going to ultimately get resolved.

On the subject of consumer surplus.  There are only 16 million bitcoin in existence.  Of those, probably 4 million are lost, in wallets that have no private keys,  or are otherwise not in circulation.  that leaves 12 million coins in supply.  Coinbase at last report has some 10 million users.  There's barely enough supply for all of coinbase's users to have 1 each.  Demand is through the roof and every dip is seen as a sale.

This isn't a bubble, its the beginning of a [technology adoption curve](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_adoption_life_cycle) and things are going to start moving very quickly over the next 24 to 36 months.

edit to change ""in the next 24 to 36 months"" to ""over the next"" because momentum is already building.

"This is a fallacy. If energy costs fall with the introduction of cheap renewables, this will actually cause more energy to be devoted to Bitcoin mining (giving the same amount of overall expenditure).

Miners will expend as much energy as is profitable to mine a Bitcoin. If the price of Bitcoin is $10,000 then miners will find it profitable to spend just below $10,000 to mine one. If the the cost of energy falls by a factor of 10 they will just expend 10 times the energy but still the same amount of money overall.

"> So people who aren't visionaries are dismissive calling bitcoin tulips and bubbles and claiming every correction is a sign that bitcoin is doomed.

I remember when they called it a scam and a ponzi scheme and when every dip was a sign of the impending collapse of bitcoin where it would collapse to $0.00 value and you would loose everything! lol

"**Technology adoption life cycle**

The technology adoption lifecycle is a sociological model that describes the adoption or acceptance of a new product or innovation, according to the demographic and psychological characteristics of defined adopter groups. The process of adoption over time is typically illustrated as a classical normal distribution or ""bell curve"". The model indicates that the first group of people to use a new product is called ""innovators"", followed by ""early adopters"". Next come the early majority and late majority, and the last group to eventually adopt a product are called ""phobics."" Phobics use the cloud without knowing they are doing.

Bitcoin is a list of transactions shared on a very large network of computers. Your bitcoins are attached to a private cryptographic key which allows you to send said bitcoins to a bitcoin address. The bitcoin network, a decentralized network anyone can participate in, uses a large amount of computational power to verify the validity of transactions and mine new bitcoins by solving a difficult cryptographic problem.

Price goes up when demand outweighs supply (lots of people trying to enter the market.) Price goes down when supply outweighs demand (some whale/lots of people decide to cash out of their purchases or sell their mined coins for cash.)

The difference with Bitcoin is everything is exaggerated. Because there are so many people who are in to make a quick buck, they emphasize these price swings with excitement in both directions. There is overreaction to price increases, causing massive FOMO.

When things start going down, lots of people panic, and unfortunately make the mistake of selling. This increases supply further and reduces the price further. There are only so many stupid people though, and only so many people who want to cash out, so eventually the selling stops, people who understand investing or Bitcoin buy back in during massive drops which corrects the price.

It’s a great comment, but that goes for everything in society. If money stops flowing, Everything collapses. That’s all the stock market is is a future gamble. That’s what interest rates are set on. That’s why we have inflation. Because it keeps velocity up in the monetary system. Minor Inflation is not a bad thing. It’s when we have the big dickheads at the top of the pyramid manipulating the system in the big banks gaming the system and government fostering those actions. A real stable currency should be released slowly overtime in accordance with population growth but we all know that greed destroys even a perfect system. I love big coin but I do believe it is an experiment, and a complete mystery as to who the fuck created it! I personally think that it will be around but it will be so valuable that transactions will be difficult to do in and out of that. Kind of the same thing when you invest in a 401K, moving money in and out of it is difficult and takes an act of Congress and usually occurs a huge penalty. That is because they want stability to an extent. I believe there will be another widespread currency that is adopted for day-to-day transactions that will be centralized and government controlled. That is not what I want but I am not stupid and actually believe that government will stand back and let us create our own money. Those fuckers will shut it down so fast. The IRS is already subpoenaed coin base for their transaction records. Regulations are coming. decentralized currency will be great for the micro economies that will emerge with block chain technology;108;7;False;knadkicker1;dqjqu3t;Don't invest recklessly;7gi55s;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7gi55s/dont_invest_recklessly/
"> We're all pooling our ""wealth"" into bitcoin and as long as only some of us takes it out at a time it works.

You're almost correct. However, there's no pool to take money out of. It's already taken, all of it. For anyone to sell bitcoins for money, somebody else must be willing to buy them, essentially putting some money in the pool which the seller immediately takes. There is no buffer. If there are no more buyers, no more bitcoins can be sold and the price goes to zero.

"> compared to 10 years ago

I'm not sure how old you are but things aren't the best or worst they have ever been. There were two HUGE credit bubbles in the 90's and again in the 00's. The first was personal loans and credit cards, the second was mortgage and mortgage insurance. Given the chance, people in the U.S. will live well beyond their means for various reasons and it has been like that for a while, going back at least to the Regan administration. This has put pressure on everyone to live beyond their means just to feel like they're status-quo.

At the same time we've reached a critical point in logistical infrastructure in the last few decades. A car used to be a large, long term investment because they were ""durable goods"" and more money went into maintaining them than making them. As engineering, manufacturing, and shipping costs have all come down proportionately cars are now cheap and interchangable. Think ""car as a capital investment"" versus ""car as a service"". It's not just cars, either. Nearly everything in wide ciculation has undergone this change, we are now a much more truly ""disposable society"".

Very few people can do everything in cash, and it actually doesn't pay in most instances. Big purchases like a house or vehicle help you get ahead and make more than they lose in the long run.

Only if wages don’t keep up with inflation is there a problem. I think the middle and upper classes have kept up but the minimum wage earners have not until the recent attempts to increase the min.

"Imagine you invested $100 in BTC because that is what you are comfortable risking.  Your exposure is $100.  If the value goes up to $500, you are now risking $500 on your BTC investment.  The extra & 400 is gains, but it is your money and you are rising it on BTC.  Are you suddenly comfortable with a $500 risk?  

I ask myself... If I sold all of my BTC, and that money was in the bank , how much would I want to reinvest?  If it is the full amount, I don't sell.  If not, I should sell some.

It is smart to ask these questions in pure dollar figures, as in the example, and also as a percentage of your wealth.  In the example, if you started with $600 in the bank and invested the $100, that was about 17% of your money.  Then the BTC became $500, your total value is $1000, and now 50% of your money is in BTC.  Make sure you are comfortable with that.

In traditional (long-term) asset investing, ""buy and hold"" is the mantra to avoid emotional (irrational) decision-making. But even then, you [should] periodically re-evaluate your investment case for that asset to ensure there has not been a material change that affects your calculations of that asset's value.

"Deflationary currencies can discourage impulse buys, but not purchases that are required to maintain your standard of living. The main difference vs inflationary systems is that people with savings wouldn't get screwed over by rampant inflation.

Hell, even GDP wouldn't suffer, because all that capital gains from savings would just be another source of income as far as the government is concerned. To offset reduced consumerism, corporations would simply hold savings and benefit from the deflation. The politicians would still get to point to growing GDP and pretend it was thanks to them, everyone would have the same or higher standard of living, but there would be less rampant consumerism filling up the landfills with crap. Merchants who sell less from reduced consumerism would still make up for it in capital gains.

"> That's only a ~2 Trillion Market Cap

Right now for $100k I can change bitcoin's market cap by over $100 million dollars (although briefly).

Market cap is useless as a number for bitcoin when trying to compare it to its impact on the larger economy. The market cap right now is over $100billion and I can assure you no where near that amount of money has gone into bitcoin. And **that** should worry everyone.

Think about it, where did that ""wealth"" come from? What former billionaire is now flat broke since everyone who invested in bitcoin took his money? When bcash split off, who put in $23billion into it? Why is it ""worth"" $23billion?

Everyone seems to hate fractional reserve banking, but not realizing that bitcoin as of right now is almost the same thing (in terms of creating ""fake"" wealth). We're all pooling our ""wealth"" into bitcoin and as long as only some of us takes it out at a time it works. But if we all took it out at once? It'd collapse the system completely.

The only way Bitcoin survives in the long run is if people can use bitcoin directly for goods and services. Right now that just isn't true as very few people accept bitcoin as payment. (Processors that just take bitcoin and deliver fiat to businesses don't count).

Until it's usable as a currency in a real sense, Bitcoin's value depends on people not actually claiming their ""wealth tickets"". ";454;15;False;awoeoc;dqjps5b;Don't invest recklessly;7gi55s;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7gi55s/dont_invest_recklessly/

"The importance for Bitcoin is the number of people buying some. I personally think it's value is directly related to this.

Not how much they spend individually. How much we each spend now is our own call on how rich we're hoping to be in the future from it.

So if anyone is trying to have a more solid understanding of how much they should value Bitcoin then look at the number of people who own some. If it correlates with it's market value you can make a call on the price being over or undervalued.

Another thing: 60% of Bitcoin trades are made by Japanese people.

If you take the relative value of any one currency and compare that to derivatives it is insanely small.

"blackjack is predictable and winnable depending on the agreement of rules.

bitcoin has the intrinsic value of being an untouchable store of wealth, unlike fiat.

saying ""it's like gambling"" is because your involvement is to buy at X and sell at Y when Y>X.


To put it another way, banks ""close your account"" if they don't like you moving around too much, or too often, bitcoin money. How's that make you feel? When ""official"" money is just as tainted? 

Funny, I can buy and sell other things. Why are these tokens considered so hostile and poisonous? 

Control is why. Just like a casino can ban you for winning too much.

And this isn't a neckbeard libertarian slant, it's a ""the people with money will suppress others from wresting control away from them by setting policy via threat of incarceration, seizure and violence."" 

Think about it this way: you trigger suspicious activity at a bank via bitcoin, wouldn't it make much more sense for that bank -- who has all of your personal information -- to let it keep going so that an investigation into your ""crimes"" can occur? Now think why they just shut it down, instead.

"I have no idea :)

Generally speaking, I interpret it to be contrarian - sell when the price is going to the moon, and buy when others are jumping out of windows. Assuming, of course, that you have done your due diligence to determine that you are investing in a solid asset that will recover the value that Mr. Market is irrationally shedding.

Warren Buffet (who said that quote) is considered to be a great investor because of his ability to analyse businesses and determine fair values, and then purchase/invest in those businesses when the broader market has unfairly / irrationally discounted them.

As for Bitcoin - we don't have a valuation model that fits (or at least I haven't seen one), so ""fair value"" is impossible to determine.  I certainly see the parabola as being ""greedy"" - and if Bitcoin were a significant/substantial part of my investment portfolio I would be selling & re-balancing at this time.

However - for me it's ""fun money"". If it goes to zero, my retirement is not impacted. If it goes to Mars - then my retirement might come early :)  And everything in between, I'm just going to hold until I have a better use for those funds.

For example - I could cash out now and pay off my car. That'd be nice, but it wouldn't change my life.  If it hits $100k+ in a year (or two, or three) - where I can then cash out & pay off my house -- that's a much more compelling offer that I would probably take advantage of, because that would have a huge impact on my living situation.

"For what it's worth, that general sentiment is part of why I hold a lot of BTC. The principle that it's all just software and that you can always update software is pretty powerful. And while it may be true to some extent, even a great extent, I don't think it's true for everything. 


It's especially not true for some unforeseeable advancement that, for whatever reason, is fundamentally different from Bitcoin in such a way that it can't be replicated by Bitcoin devs.


All that said, I'd love some clarification on the general issue of Bitcoin updating/adopting to new advances in the technology. 


Take Ethereum - it's written in its own custom programming language vs the stack-based language Bitcoin uses. If the custom language is ultimately something that turns out to be very important, could Bitcoin implement something similar? ? Could Bitcoin implement the Smart Contracts and DApps that Ethereum offers? Is there any current coin with features/fundamentals that are different from Bitcoin in such a way that Bitcoin can't replicate it later?


And now I'm rambling. As I say this, it seems clear to me that Bitcoin could always (hypothetically) just freeze the ledger and update to a completely new platform that somehow has the original ledger/blockchain attached. Still, disagreement/animosity among Bitcoin devs might halt the sort of widespread agreement that could be required for implementing such a massive change.

This. If you use a third-party service like Coinbase to store your BTC, then all your kin actually have is a promise from Coinbase that they'll pass your account balance to them.

"People tend to get this weird idea that 10%+ increases per day are totally sustainable and that, worst case, it will probably only drop 20-50% in the case of a crash. People need to understand that a 90% drop is not only possible, but extremely likely based on previous bubbles.

Earlier today I saw someone say that you should buy now because if we get to $25k, it will only crash to $20k! No. If we get to $25k and it then crashes, expect to see a drop to ~$6-8k followed by a bounce back up a bit, then a very slow drop to $2.5k. This scenario has happened before.

If you remove the bubbles from Bitcoin's history, it looks pretty similar to Amazon, yes. So, if you have a bunch of money that you don't really care about, putting it in Bitcoin is not a bad idea. But, that was never the point of the OP. The point was that if you invest more than you can afford to lose in the short term and know that you would not be able to withstand a drop to $1k or less for an extended period of time without being pressured to sell at a major loss, you should re-evaluate your investment decision.

That is why we always push for dollar-cost-averaging: you put in what you don't need from every paycheck and HODL until you hit the moon.

"I've invested quite a lot in BTC, but this type of  sentiment  unnerves quite a bit. Talking in absolutes about the future of something with so many unknowns is dangerous. You're writing as if, in the span of 3 sentences, you've composed a definitive proof of why BTC can't fail (""So if it was going to fail, then it would've failed already by now..."").


There are so many ways BTC could fail. No one knows what's going to happen. I think the most likely scenario is that BTC has an ""AOL-like"" rise and fall. Super exciting new technology, first major success of its kind, but ultimately replaced by a far superior tech/product. AOL is still around, and I think Bitcoin will always be around, but I don't think it's going to be THE coin in the long run. And yes, yes I know AOL and BTC have essentially nothing in common, I just feel like they share some really general themes.


All that said, I place well under a 50% chance of that scenario playing out.

"A key point I like to make is that if you over extend yourself you will be a bad investor.

A good investor is calculated and unemotional. A good investor has a plan and executes on it, revises it with reliable new information, but otherwise stays the course.

A bad investor is irrational and emotional. They get worked up and constantly second guess themselves; they get worked up by crowds.  They freak out at rapid increases and buy high, they freak out at rapid decreases and sell low.

Accidentally leaving my brokerage keyfob at home has resulted in some of the better trading ""decisions"" that I've made.

For most people, if they over-extend themselves, they will behave more like a bad investor even if they know better... if you've made an investment you can't afford to lose, you're much more likely to lose part of it in a panic effort to prevent losing all of it.

It can be easy and fun to visualize the million dollar Bitcoin and the private space elevator you're going to finance with your new found wealth...  but you should be equally mentally and emotionally prepared for movement in the other direction. If you aren't, you're going to do something different than what your own dispassionate analysis would tell you to do.

Probably the hardest thing about this is that the fears that drive bad trades are not completely ill-founded.  It's _possible_ that if the market is now at price $x that this will be the last opportunity to trade (in either the buy or sell direction) at that price in your lifetime.  But given the volatility of Bitcoin,  ""seldom again prices"" are pretty rare, and happen in both directions-- so while it's possible to miss out, but you shouldn't let that drive your decision making. People tend to think only about the option they're considering and forget that for every trade someone else is taking the opposite position.

Another thing to keep in mind is that trading itself involves fees, which are incrementally small but add up.  You can make every decision correctly but still lose a lot of funds if you trade frequently.  It's not enough for a trade to be right, it has to be right enough to overcome its overheads (e.g. spread and fees). You can improve your odds both of not wasting funds in fees and of making poorly considered emotional decisions by behaving more passively.";74;2;False;nullc;dqjyknw;Don't invest recklessly;7gi55s;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7gi55s/dont_invest_recklessly/

"I wonder how many other late baby-boomers now approaching retirement are in this Subreddit?

As a generation we started so hopeful in the 70’s butbhave, over the years, been ground down by declining (in real terms) wages, corporate power consolidation and ever more corporate MSM-called ‘special interests’ corruption at the higher levels of government in the West.  

(For those who haven’t seen it, I suggest to watch Nigel Farage on YT expose many - even the most senior MEPs - in the EU as being in the pocket of George Soros and his vile agenda).

I was in Bitcoin in 2013 because I thought it cool.  This was before I figured out, that like the internet, it appears to have been gifted to humankind as a means to take back control over our amazing place  - our planet - from the Babylonian money-lenders who have all but stolen all our collective inheritance.

I have an unfathomable number of Dogecoin on a hard-drive somewhere from that era and rue the day that I liquidated many BTC in payment.

I mention this experience as I hope it will urge some who are in this first-time-round to exercise caution/ moderation in alt coin investing. ( I still do this, but now practice what I preach.)

I am in a position where I have invested 50% of my pension funds in BTC and siblings.

It is my best chance to fund the retirement that I worked for and believe I ( and everyone else ) deserves.

We are not here as get rich quick types but because we are in the situation we are.   In previous generations the government who we paid taxes to in our working lives would have looked after us in old age with a comfortable pension.

Nowadays we ( and unfortunately younger Subreddits will) pay taxes to repay government debt to privately-owned central banks ( who issue us money out of thin air ) and then ask for interest in return !  The interest burden on this phoney debt leaves nothing for our governments to pay for basic services and pensions for those you have worked every day of their adult lives.

So for those in a similar situation to myself I urge you to pay heed to this Subredditor and invest wisely and follow his/ her advice.

BTC and siblings offer humankind a lifeline to finally rid ourselves of the Babylonian banksters and their evil cabal who do not have our best interests at heart.

Millennials I urge you to embrace it, further it anyway you can, don’t let the corrupt legislate against it, love each other,  support each other, take back control- my children (and yours) will understand what you did and will love you for it.

This is all actually really great information. I honestly think with all the new people getting into BTC, something like this should be added to the FAQ or as a sticky, because I think a lot of people are getting into this exclusively as an investment, and are buying blind. There is a ""bitcoin as an investment wiki,"" but it doesn't really stress how important it is to avoid common traps when investing like this post does. 

Also, I think people should stop viewing it as an investment in terms of growth. I personally view it more as a hedge against the buffoonery of government money management, which has wrecked many a currency in the past. The hope is that if my gov screws up our money and the value goes to crap, maybe BTC will still work. If it goes up in value in the mean time, great.

"Bitcoins have been increasing like crazy year over year. There is nothing specific in this post as to why not to invest. As long as you're investing for the long term you're good. 

This post just compels you to worry over it. It's like saying ""invest.. but wait you should not invest because it's not safe.. but invest.. but wait it's not safe"". Worrying over your investment isn't going to make it better. In fact it's more likely to get you to make worse decisions. If you invest some money in it then do it for the long term. Put the money into it and then don't worry about the weekly fluctuations. And just like you invest in the stock market you should invest a little amount. Don't invest everything you got into this.

All good advice and very carefully framed. My one nitpick is that I think that $100k-$250k would not imply that fiat is becoming worthless or the prevailing economic regime has completely fallen apart. That's only a ~2 Trillion Market Cap still far less than gold and the rise of gold certainly hasn't made fiat worthless.

Good points. I'd just like to add that we're treating a currency here as if it were a commodity or a company, which it's not.

I meant the comment initially as a joke, then it evolved to be ""*obviously unrealistic as an expectation - but plausible nonetheless*""

I look at it this way - $4k initial investment to $1m requires eight 'doublings'.  I just deposited enough money for a second bitcoin so that drops my required doublings to seven.

So on that scale, I'm at about 1.6 out of 7.  That will be out the window if the growth is indeed additive.  Why did you suggest it would be?

"> Coinbase does not give you the seed and handles security for you. Coinbase could freeze your account for whatever reason. Also, exchanges get hacked: (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mt._Gox). When you have your bitcoins in a more secure wallet, no one can stop you from accessing your funds. Hacks are much, much less likely. I use Greenaddress for iPhone and a Trezor (https://trezor.io) for larger amounts. I recommend those because the transactions fees from those wallets are cheaper than most. Other recommended wallets can be found herehttps://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet.
> A seed is usually 12-24 words that you write down when setting up these more secure wallets and store in a safe place. Even if GreenAddress, for example, disappeared of the face of the earth, your phone got run over by a car, you lost your Trezor...if you have those 12-24 words, you should be able to access your funds. Those two are very user friendly, without technically computer knowledge or anything like that.
> Saying you are over your heads makes me think you invested too much money. Bitcoin is not a guaranteed road to riches. Only invest what you are willing to lose.

100% agree. I'm personally maybe more conservative than some here and crypto remains at 10% of my total investment with new money. If it goes to 0, doesn't impact my future that much because the 90% in index funds and such was what I was relying on. If it continues to moon rocket, that 10% investment could grow bigger than the 90 and I'm richer than I bargained for. ;2;1;False;ShaidarHaran2;dqji040;Guys, I am out;7fvoxh;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7fvoxh/guys_i_am_out/
"Mathematically, I know what I'm doing.  

*Let's assume* that the nature of growth is multiplicative, then evaluate that assumption later.

* Start with a two bitcoin investment at $4k (so $8k)

That's not the argument.

The argument isn't that nothing will ever need adjusting and that anything that doesn't work straight away is doomed to fail.

I'm not arguing against the need for innovation or iterative design. I'm arguing against the opposite of that, of dogmatic loyalty to one idea.
 
To use your car analogy, Bitcoin is not the Model T, Satoshi is not Ford. Bitcoin is the Rivaz engine. The people I'm arguing against are the people that are saying that the Rivaz engine is the best engine design there could be, and all we need to do is improve that design and we will have the perfect car. In fact there's no problem with the Rivaz engine, it was never meant to power a car by itself, we just need an attachment to the Rivaz engine to make it work the way it was always meant to. Any other engine designs are shitengines and are just people trying to scam people who really want a Rivaz engine.

It's as ridiculous to assume that Bitcoin is the final word in currency as it would be to assume the Rivaz engine was the final word in automobiles. 

If Lightning fails to scale, do you honestly think that this community will sit back and go ""oh no, that thing we were convinced would solve all bitcoins problems has failed, maybe bitcoin won't work after all, maybe we need to look at a different technology""? Or do you think they will just immediately switch to being convinced that some other solution will fix all of bitcoins problems. 

This is not the attitude of being open to innovation wherever it comes from. This is an attitude of trying to justify the ever increasing price of bitcoin no matter what. There is no underlying principle at work behind these arguments, its just use whatever is the most convenient explanation for why bitcoin needs to keep increasing in price. I would not be surprised if we start hearing ""2nd layer solutions were never supposed to work by themselves"" soon.

"**Civil forfeiture in the United States**

Civil forfeiture in the United States, also called civil asset forfeiture or civil judicial forfeiture or occasionally civil seizure, is a controversial legal process in which law enforcement officers take assets from persons suspected of involvement with crime or illegal activity without necessarily charging the owners with wrongdoing. While civil procedure, as opposed to criminal procedure, generally involves a dispute between two private citizens, civil forfeiture involves a dispute between law enforcement and property such as a pile of cash or a house or a boat, such that the thing is suspected of being involved in a crime. To get back the seized property, owners must prove it was not involved in criminal activity. Sometimes it can mean a threat to seize property as well as the act of seizure itself.

"> In my opinion it's dangerous as it has no intrinsic value

Ah the ol no intrinsic value meme. I use [the 1:10000 rule](https://xkcd.com/1053/) for this argument.  It is my opinion that the intrinsic value of bitcoin is far far greater than anyone really comprehends.  People generally are too focused on people just buying and selling the asset, but not about the cryptographic proof, and incentive structure that perpetuates the network functioning.  So when people like to ask what the intrinsic value of bitcoin is, I say :

You are thinking of the store of value property without the cryptographic property that secures it. You are talking about it as one would talk about valuable shells, and even shell sellers, and not the security that separates it from all forms of value exchange before it. To understand the intrinsic value of bitcoin it is good to use the analogy of an envelope. So i ask you : does an envelope have intrinsic value?

If I have a letter that I need to send securely, would I prefer to send it open, and ready to be read? Or would I prefer for it to be sent within the confines of an envelope? Now let's think... would I prefer to just leave an open envelope, or would I think it necessary to put some seal across it to ensure that it isn't opened, and read whilst en-route. Does a sealable envelope have more intrinsic value than an unsealable one? Hmm... but what if someone can counterfeit the seal? I need some method of ensuring that the message I want to get to that person isn't read, and preferably, isn't even identified as a message. That's when you need to get lawyers involved. Sounds expensive. There's obviously something intrinsically valuable about such a service, because many people pay oh-so-very-much money for it.

Now let's imagine we're not talking about letters, we're talking about money. Would you address a $100 note through the mail to your child for their birthday? You'd pay for a stamp at least. Would you encase it in an envelope that you paid for at the local post-shop? Hmm... bill in the envelope.  Anyone will be able to see that it is money. Perhaps encase it in a card? What if it is $1000? $10,000? $10 million?  Does the protection service of an envelope somehow decrease because the value of the contents of the package increases? It's the opposite, isn't it? Bitcoin is both the cryptographically sealed envelope, and the network to deliver it.

What say you? Is an envelope intrinsically valuable?

I just feel there are other coins that are or will be more functional than Bitcoin, and once they start being accepted in more places and especially if they catch up or pass Bitcoin in trading pairs on the exchanges, people will switch to  those currencies, and Bitcoin won't make a very good store of value if it doesn't have utility.";1;1;False;LegitosaurusRex;dqjjjzi;Here's to all of our new friends, welcome!;7gdit9;https://i.imgur.com/QA8FPGA.jpg

I dislike and disagree with civil forfeiture just as much as the next guy, but I haven't heard of any cases where the government seized all the assets of people who mostly weren't doing anything illegal, held by a company that wasn't doing anything illegal.

If Coinbase doesn't comply with court orders, I could see them being shut down, but even then I would think it likely that the government would give people a chance to get their money back first.";1;1;False;LegitosaurusRex;dqjk557;Here's to all of our new friends, welcome!;7gdit9;https://i.imgur.com/QA8FPGA.jpg

"Don't worry, buying at the peak before a correction feels bad, but as long as you don't sell, eventually (in a few weeks) you will see it rising higher than your buying point. We all have had experience like this, and trust me, the only regrets we have are for the times we sold, never for having bought in the past.

Another advice is to move your bitcoin to your own wallet as soon as you buy them. Don't leave them lying around in exchanges because you will be tempted to sell or to set up limit orders and like I said above, you are likely to regret selling bitcoin later. Just keep them in your offline wallet and let them grow.

"Setup a wallet at your leisure. Whatever works for you.

I suggest starting with something easy like Coinbase. I also know people here hate it but the normies I converted prefer it because it’s a US operation and the owner was interviewed in the news.

Download and install nicehash miner, by clicking Sell on Nicehash.com, then CPU/GPU. Then that page should have a download link.

If you have an AMD GPU in your PC you’ll need the legacy version.

Once installed paste your wallet address in the app and click GO.

Easiest point and click method there is. Now the catch.

Nicehash is using your PC to mine altcoins. They get zcash, ether, and lite coin and then pay you for the trouble in bitcoin.

They probably aren’t giving you a fair amount, and calculating what you’re missing gets complicated.

You could make more operating the mining software from the command line, and joining your rig to a mining pool, then selling those alrcoins for bitcoins, but that gets technical and a bit investments/markety.

So that’s the trade off, but I think it’s worth it to effectively “mine bitcoins” at home. Aka get paid in bitcoin to mine altcoin for someone else.

"I just started last Sunday after the ""$9000"" hype. I had heard and looked at Bitcoin a few months ago, but it looked difficult to get into because I didn't want to have it connected to my checking account. I looked around again on Sunday and found that Coinbase was finally taking credit cards. I bought a few hundred $ between BTC, ETH, and LTC. Hate the fees, but I like the convenience and security of using a credit card. 

I saw the rise yesterday evening and the dip today, fun stuff! I'm looking into how to use GDAX to mitigate the fees and I bought a Ledger Nano S to put my coins in cold storage. I plan to buy on the dips and ""HODL"" until I reach my ""moon""...which I'm not sure what that is yet. Retiring by 35 would be nice.

I know I'm a bit late, but I wanted some better security. Hopefully I've managed to get in before this goes really mainstream. I'm looking forward to following this sub and laughing at the memes.
