"Look, I'm sure you're a lot smarter than you sound right now, so I'll give you the benefit of the doubt that you're asking this question because you, yourself, are being obtuse and just pretending not to understand that there is a difference in risk between contacting someone to recover a debt and contacting someone to inform them that they have money waiting for them. If I'm mistaken in that assumption, I humbly apologize and bid you good luck with all your life's endeavors.

As far as ""defending banks for some ungodly reason"", if you haven't been following, pretty much everyone who knows how this actually works has already informed OP that chances are, his money is in a fund waiting for him to verify his identity and claim it. If this were cryptocurrency that OP had forgotten, it would not only be lost forever to OP, but it would be completely out of circulation for *everyone*. Why OP and you seem to think that the latter situation is somehow better is anyone's guess.";1;1;False;G_Porgie;ehx21zx;When you forget about money in a bank account and soon realise that cash you had in the bank was never yours to begin with...;avz79f;https://i.redd.it/vzg3cvsc1fj21.jpg
"As was stated above by another commenter,

>If you don't have the right mailing address on your account, how are they supposed to contact you?

People give the banks tons of excuses for their behaviour that have nothing to do with money. I shoot down those ""reasons"".

"So, do I *also* share all my debt with anyone who shares my name? How does the government know who to release the money to if there's no way to differentiate between people who share a name??

"Forgetting about an account for decades is your own fault.  Not updating a bank with your current address is your own fault.  The State taking the funds is not your fault, but is the consequence of multiple bad decisions that are your fault.  


The point being that in this case, the person has recourse.  It is unlikely to the extreme that a person would forget about a bitcoin account for many years and simultaneously have the keys to access it availability.  In that case, you have no possible recourse.  


This is a story about bad laws and bad banking and bad stewardship.  It is not a case study for why Bitcoin is better.";1;1;False;IndianaGeoff;ehy2vqs;When you forget about money in a bank account and soon realise that cash you had in the bank was never yours to begin with...;avz79f;https://i.redd.it/vzg3cvsc1fj21.jpg
