Yeah. At money exchanges. 

I mentioned gold because you seem to think vendor acceptance is what gives something value. 

There’s no question Bitcoin was modeled on gold anyway. Satoshi even mentions gold mining in the white paper. 

Dude, Bitcoin doesn’t have to do anything to rise in value. Inflation alone can do the job. An immutably limited and deflationary supply guarantees that. ";1;1;False;ebaley;eivv95f;So you don't get robbed...;b26qxy;https://i.redd.it/riv6dcyoepm21.jpg

As for evading gold, I didn't evade anything because the only mention of gold was your nonsense about Bitcoin being digital gold, I never once claimed to use it as a currency. You've suddenly pulled that shit out of your ass and are like ""YoU DiDn'T ReFutE My pOiNt"".

"What you're saying makes no sense.

What I'm telling you is based on real world experience with actual ATM operators. Many of their locations are operating at a loss. To add insult to injury, after they lost money on a location they then have to spend money on a technician who goes to that location and moves the ATM to another location.

Say you want to stop this from happening? You go and lobby congress and they cancel the 90's law that opened up the ATM market (before this law, only banks had ATM machines; the law was passed because banks failed to establish presence across the US leaving many communities without an easy way to access their cash).

Ultimately this is all bullshit because:

1) Hopefully crypto will eventually become easy enough for the common mass to adopt and use and trust

2) Nobody gives a shit what you think, if you don't want to pay a $3 fee just drive further to your bank ATM and extract your cash for ""free"".

3) Companies like VaultLogic.com and Maya.tech will make all of those old ATM machines obsolete (including bank ATMs).

"I used to live in London. I never saw anywhere accept Euros or dollars. Maybe street vendors. But then they could just as easily accept Bitcoin. And certainly no one accepted gold (something you evaded). 

It’s not doing nothing sitting in a wallet. Holders bolster the economy and are rewarded by Bitcoin being a hedge against inflation or even economic collapse. It’s use as currency will come when everyone desires it for itself and not just accepts it as an alternative. A larger market cap will make it more stable. 

Anyway why do you take it for granted Bitcoin should be accepted internationally when no currency is? Also Bitcoin has to contend with not being legal tender and not being required by law in  each country.  It has a lot to fight against. I don’t consider vendor acceptance as a criteria in any case  as to whether it’s a currency or not.

"Okay then, you're wrong on point one. I've used Euros and dollars in the UK. Believe me, don't believe me, I don't give a fuck. I've done it, they accept them, end of. 

Again, Bitcoin needs mass adoption and to actually be moved around like currency to become anything other that a speculators wet dream. It might be all of those things you claim but it's also pointless sitting in people digital wallets doing nothing, it's also much more difficult to understand and work with, which are huge negative factors for many countries in the world, basically right now and for the foreseeable future it's digital fairy money that sounds shady as fuck to almost anyone that's not tech savvy. 

Everything you said after digital gold is basically rambling so I'm gonna ignore that.

"Yup, I never said it was anonymous, its pseudonymous. that pseudonymity is often sold as a way of having ""untraceable"" transactions that you can't have with a credit card.

I mentioned cash being anonymous as an example of being superior to a selling point often cited for Bitcoin (untraceability) that doesn't actually matter because its less convenient and convenience matters more than all those selling points I listed, hence the massive and increasing popularity of credit cards.

>Because on average, it shows that people are comfortable with transactions that involve an intangible currency

Why would that be more important than it showing people are comfortable with transactions that involve a centralized 3rd party, non-anonymous traceable transactions, government fiat, fees and charges? All things that are supposedly reasons people would favor Bitcoin?

That such a payment option is on the rise weighs far more heavily against bitcoin than ""people are okay with a currency you can't hold in your hand"" weighs in favor of it.

You bozos are so one dimensional you think Bitcoin is just a currency or aiming to be one. It’s the whole thing. It’s a payment network, it’s an internet protocol, it’s a swiss bank account, it’s digital gold. 

I can’t buy toothpaste with it in the corner shop? Who gives a fuck? I wouldn’t anyway. I use fiat because I know it will lose another several thousand per cent in the next 5 years vs Bitcoin. Why?

"Come to think of it I actually had once a exchange account at Bittrex. Despite filling out full KYC, I had to wait days. The site was slow and unrelieable, and when I wanted to pull my holdings from the exchange, they only allowed me to withdraw a small amount each day. Other say thats pretty normal. 

In Asia a couple of weeks ago a owner of an exchange ""died"" and all the holdings of the exchange customers were gone, because only he had access to the keys. And should I remind ypu of the biggest Bitcoin hack in History?

I once had a problem with a Bitcoin ATM, theres a service line you can actually call and have someone to actually talk to. Try to get anybody ever on the phone from an exchange.
