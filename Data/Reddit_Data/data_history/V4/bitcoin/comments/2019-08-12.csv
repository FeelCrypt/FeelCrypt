"OK so his original investment was sth like $102. What you are saying that those who have invested that much (say 0.01 btc for simplicity) will be in the same situation in 9 years.

There were over 5.7 million addresses that had 0.01 bitcoin or more as of end of 2018, let's say it remained the same. That is way too many multimillionaires for the world. Current estimations are about 30 million btw.

Let's say world can handle 5-6 million more multi millionaires, but the picture is weirder. Among these 5.7 million addressed over 130,000 have 10+ bitcoins. If 0.01 btc will be 20 million by then, 10 bitcoins will be 20 billion. That is just not feasible, as number of billionaires today are not even on the 5 figures level, and introducing 6 figure new multi billionaires is a pipe dream.

Bitcoin will be a transfer of wealth. Those who hold Bonds and Cash will get anihilated due to currency depreciation... the wealth will transfer out of the fiat system and into alternative currencies (Bitcoin & Gold). 🥳

In this world, there is inflation which eats away at the cash every year.

How? Well I’ll tell you how;

Eventually every country will go to currency battles with each other to try pay off their debt, the citizens will OPT OUT of the nation by using Bitcoin to store and pay

Why? Because the volatility of your own country’s currency relative to another may be too vicious. For example, what if Aussie Dollar v Euro gets stronger too much but the Aussie v Yen crashes? These have implications for exporters, tourists, no coincels.

What if you could spend some of the value of your Bitcoin without actually selling your Bitcoin.

Just like when you own a house, if you own it straight up, you can mortgage it and spend the money you get out elsewhere.

Now it certainly wouldn't get you 85% value, but perhaps 85% of whats been ""proven"" to be the ""long term"" support for the current cycle.

So like right now, you'd be able to pull out 85% of $3,000 per BTC.

So every BTC could be ""mortgaged"" at $2,550.

And then there could be different intrest rates for different ""bottoms"".

This would make it more like a store of value than a currency, though.

 Cryptocurrencies  are stored either in hot wallets or cold wallets. Hot wallets are  always connected to the internet and are easier to set up. Access to,  and spending these coins are relatively easier in hot wallets. Cold  wallets, on the other hand, are storage devices and can range from  simple pieces of paper to external storage units like hard drives or pen  drives, or even encrypted phones and computing devices that aren’t  connected to the internet. Thus, cold wallets are considered much safer  than hot wallets.

I feel like the only reason you should have real regrets is if you realize a loss instead of hodling.

"Not just hold. But to accumulate. To spend and replace. And when (if) it does reach $1000000000 we hopefully won't have to ""sell"" since BTC will be accepted as widely as Visa or Mastercard today. Or 2nd scenario, we rapidly reach a point where dollars/euros/pounds will barely have any value left at all.

Honestly today whoever sees and understands the possible world-changing implications of Bitcoin should never ever sell *all* of their coins.

"Dumb. Guy made an awesome return on a small investment when Bitcoin was super sketchy.  Very tough to purchase back in the initial period as well.  Could have also lost or had his coin stolen in the numerous hacks and thefts as well, unless he literally put it in cold storage and just forgot about it.  It's endlessly pointless to look back ten years ago and say ""why didn't I invest in x"". You can do it for so many things. But how many investments also go bust or lose money? A lot.
