It's been proven over and over that most of the people that come and troll BTC threads are bitter old nasdaq and DOW traders that are for some reason completely pissed off that Bitcoin is a thing. My guess is because the majority of them got pissed when they seen people becoming overnight millionaires and billionaires & they've been playing the regular market for 20 to 40 years and still haven't seen anything close to a million dollars.

"According to the clues here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8kk0pa/1_btc_is_hidden_in_this_puzzle_good_luck/dzadar1/

clue number 5 is ""00212121""

I guessed it is an offset, when I go to that offset on the picture, it shows an ""x"" (see ""the x.png"" in here: https://www91.zippyshare.com/v/QDlyuOEW/file.html)

and the bonus clue is: ""To triumph, one must look within. To infinity, and beyond. When you are close to home, X marks the spot.""

so, maybe, I find a correct hint... maybe...

If I replace that X with certain values, the pic goes weird as I show in the files.

This is the far I can get for now.
