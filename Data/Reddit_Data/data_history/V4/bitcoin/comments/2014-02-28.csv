Shit just change it to ""poor accounting"" and that's fucking obvious from the face of it. In what crazy ass world would you honestly list yourself as a liability to yourself? So Mt Gox had 120K in coins, that got jacked. That's not a liability, it's a trading investment, AKA short term asset which should be revalued every balance sheet period and any gains or losses should go through the income statement. Fuck even listing it as ""treasury stock"" is closer then listing it as a liability. I mean really... Are we... what we are no longer reporting PPE, Prepaid Expenses, Prepaid insurance, Acc dep, AR/AP, accrued wages? ""Nah just lump all that together, and call one ""assets"" and list a dollar amount, and call the other ""liabilities"" and just list another dollar amount, and you know what, fuck that equity shit, who needs RE and Paid in Capital, and common stock, etc... to hell with double sided entries, this is mt gox bitches... Plus that shits totally worthless, like anyone would actually want to see a balance sheet that balances!?!?!?""  Jeezussss.... I'm seriously hoping this is fake, there is honestly no way that can be a true doc... 

Sorry to keep ranting but I just found this thing and part of me is hopeing its real, because it will be the laughing stock of the accounting world for YEARS to come. 

>With actual assets using arbitrage/ injecting new coins to erase them from the books. 

Anyone have any idea what that means? Is Gox suggesting that through arbitrage it would be able to recover all the lost funds? 

>Informing and asking selected Bitcoin main players to ask for their help. 

So literally forming a conspiracy, engaging in insider trading, and all the while... what? telling the public everything is okay? HOLY FUCKING ENRON! 

>Injections in coin are most useful (enough to run the exchange) but some cash is also needed to not run a fractional reserve

So as if insider trading wasn't enough you're going to double down on stupid and admit you are running a ponzi scheme, IE using newly injected coins to pay off depositors?!?!? 

I'm seriously at a loss for words!?!?!? Seriously.....

"see now we are on the same page lol. I can understand not giving full disclosure statements monthly as that would be UN GODLY expensive and probably a waste of time. Furthermore I would even be willing to accept just who the auditors are, what the scope is, and what regs there applying. I think those things alone could be a huge help to bitcoin. 

> nd that a simple audit of Private Account Balance v.s. Blockchain Address Balance would take an hour or two at best

Right!?!?! I'm not sure if you're familiar with IDEA, but that program is BADASS, and it could very easily query that data it also accepts data from QB, PeachTree, Excel, CSV, and a few other lessor platforms, and any decent accounting software I ever come across at a minimum allows for TB export into CSV or EXCEL. I mean if you came to me and said Romad you will look at this company monthly, and you only have one billable hour, the VERY first thing I'm going to do is verify balances. If time permits I would probably move on to make sure no transfers went to personal accounts. 

>Listen to the latest Lets Talk Bitcoin podcast. Charlie and others thing that 740k bitcoins just disapearing before MtGox noticed is just ridiculously insane to be believable...

No doubt, I know clients that don't check bank balances daily, and I have one client that only checks it monthly, (against our advice), however to think that you could do a bank rec consistently month after month after month, and not notice your are continually coming up millions short?!?!?!

"Thank you for your kind words of support during this difficult time. It's become apparent to me that my ass pizza joke was perhaps too subtle, too edgy or too soon and I have paid the price for my temerity. 

Thankfully I am surrounded by supportive people (including your good self) and am being counselled through this period of loss. My 47 down votes were like surrogate children to me. It's difficult to comprehend the suffering that has been inflicted on me - when I woke this morning and looked at my profile I let out a plaintive cry and collapsed, crying, rolling about and pounding my fists futilely on the cold and bitter ground. 

However there is a ray of light peeking out from the smelly, dirty sky of this evil day. And it shines from you.

It is because of you that I was able to pick myself up, steady my shaking hands and quivering lips and slowly begin the painful journey of moving forward with the rest of my life, irrevocably changed as it may be.

So please accept my sincere thanks and also the only thing I have to give, paltry and shallow as it may be. This humble upvote is yours my friend.

"Excellent question!

Keeping your bitcoin keys in a safe deposit box is what is generally referred to as *deep* cold storage. Generally very safe, but the tradeoff is obviously in convenience and utility.

Cold storage can be a paper wallet or a usb drive, or just about any medium that can store a key offline (clay tablet, a dead hobo's jawbone, etc) that is readily accessible. Some people may quibble on the fine points of the distinctions between deep cold storage and cold storage, but I think the characterization I've provided is functional, at least.

Paper wallet instructions are [here](http://blockchain.info/wallet/paper-tutorial). If you think you'll be making several purchases with Btc (and you should!), you can keep a certain amount in an encrypted wallet on your computer (less secure than paper/usb/deep cold storage/etc, but more convenient, and still more secure than an exchange).";0;0;False;StringJunky;cfr44gr;We've gotta be able to laugh at ourselves;1z5ynn;http://explosm.net/db/files/Comics/Rob/givemeyourcash.png

"You know its funny you bring the SEC into this.... Can you guess whats the first rule that SEC has regarding exchanges? Go ahead I bet you can... Check this out. 

>The Commission adopted Rule 15c3-3 in 1972 in response to a congressional 
directive to strengthen the financial responsibility requirements for broker-dealers that 
hold securities and cash for customers.
 In particular, Rule 15c3-3 is designed “to give 
more specific protection to customer funds and securities, in effect forbidding brokers 
and dealers from using customer assets to finance any part of their businesses unrelated to 
servicing securities customers; e.g., a firm is virtually precluded from using customer 
funds to buy securities for its own account.”
 To meet this objective, Rule 15c3-3 
requires a broker-dealer that maintains custody of customer securities and cash (a“carrying broker-dealer”) to take two primary steps to safeguard these assets. The steps 
are designed to protect customers
 by segregating their securities and cash from the 
broker-dealer’s proprietary business activities. If the broker-dealer fails financially, the 
securities and cash should be readily available to be returned to the customers. In 
addition, if the failed broker-dealer is liquidated in a formal proceeding under the 
Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 (“SIPA”), the securities and cash would be 
isolated and readily identifiable as “customer property” and, consequently, available to be 
distributed to customers ahead of other creditors.10 

Hmmm.... Sounds like the SEC figured out Mt. Gox's plan was horrible back in 1970... 

Oh and before the Derp Derp, yeah what about blah blah blah.... Allow me to show you how this rule works PERFECTLY with MF Global. 

>On Sunday, October 30, 2011, a unit of the New York-based brokerage first reported to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) a “material shortfall” of hundreds of millions of dollars in segregated customer funds. Customer accounts were frozen the same day.

And what was the end result of this? 

>MF Global Inc.’s trustee will get court approval to complete distributions to former customers of the failed brokerage, allowing all missing funds to be returned by the end of the year.
>That’s quite an accomplishment,’’ Glenn said at a hearing in Manhattan. At the outset of the case, nobody thought that customers would recover everything they lost, he said http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-11-05/mf-global-trustee-can-distribute-100-of-customer-funds.html

OHHHHH!!!!!! Look at that shit 100%!!!! Financial regulations designed to protect depositors in the event a brokerage goes out of business, and what happens! They fucking work just as expected....

Generally yes, but due to a transaction program shitstorm (I believe that's the technical term) mtgox denied users the ability to withdraw their coins for a time, so coins on gox were insanely cheap because they were useless for all but trading on gox. Then people started thinking they could make a quick buck by buying gox fun bucks and (wrongly) assuming they would at some point get them out.;14;1;False;frazior5;cfqwsr2;We've gotta be able to laugh at ourselves;1z5ynn;http://explosm.net/db/files/Comics/Rob/givemeyourcash.png

"The fact that people trusted Mt. Gox is the biggest joke here.  I was never fully sold on bitcoin, but at least bitcoin is novel and interesting.  Yet to buy into bitcoin you had to trust all the exchanges, because where else were you going to get the exact amount you wanted?  

That was my biggest complaint about bitcoin, the whole infrastructure seemed taped together with duct tape and always has.  Even when I wanted to get involved I didn't simply because we aren't dealing with the New York Stock Exchange.  The government tries to make trading fair, but to do that it has to play a somewhat direct role in businesses.  In most cases the government tries to make investing and trading fair for everyone involved (I know the government can be untrustworthy too, but the SEC does more good than harm at the end of the day), what protections do people have concerning Mt. Gox?

If something like the SEC was allowed to look into Mt. Gox and found everything was in working order I would have at least a little bit of trust.  As it stands people were handing enormous amounts of money to people who had no government oversight and likely had never seen a million dollars in their lives.  Can you imagine how tempting it must have been to possess control over this wealth but no ownership?  

I barely trust banks or services like Scottrade, and everyone involved in things like that are licensed and watched very carefully.  Yet it would seem Mt. Gox found countless people to buy into the hype train while ignoring common sense.  That common sense?  A Magic the Gathering card game website and the people who ran it were not equipped to deal with a fucking exchange this large.  Even professional exchanges experience hiccups from time to time, what did people expect the Mt. Gox crew to be doing?  Carefully handling all these millions?  

Serious question, does this mean Bitcoin is dead?  I can't imagine anyone trusting these illegitimate exchanges anymore.

Talk shit about things like the SEC all you want but I guarantee you those running Mt. Gox were not very discreet about their thievery, and anyone could have caught them before we reached this point.  I'm sure *I* could have determined they were stealing if I was given complete access.

"The bitcoin investing crowd has the psychology of any other past or future single speculative investment. There is no such thing as a sure thing when your strategy and emotion point you to a single investment. If the goal in life is to have your net worth grow through investing then it takes diversifying in all kinds of stocks (usually through mutual funds), bonds, real estate and for many your own business.  Why risk so much on something so speculative when their are so many ways to grow your money with much less risk? Once you have money to invest the name of the game is ""asset protection.""  Taking your hard earned money and getting emotional about any one investment has shown time and time and time again to be a bad strategy for accumulating wealth.

"My old homie hassan used to do a very particular whistle when walking our block. It's how he knew if friends were near. We would whistle back.

I had just started a job at Jack n the Box, and was sitting on my steps waiting for the bus to make it's appearance. And these 3 Navajo came walking up. They all 3 looked like guys, but one was a girl. Well, hassan was drunk as shit, and I heard his whistle. Not having any time for his drunk ass, I paid no attention hoping he wouldn't notice me. But the natives... They were drunk, and didn't know what was going on. So they started whistling. Well, here he comes, with his bulldog. 

Now, I'm a reformed thug. We used to be horrible fucking people. I knew shit might go down, but I stayed on my stairs just watching to see what he was alike when he was *alone*. 

Turns out, he's 10X as mean alone as he was in our little crew. This motherfucker starts beating all of them. One of them takes off like a little bitch. The other one stood there and took all the hits to the face, and just kinda did the coward thing. But then he slapped the chick, and I had to get down there. When she was like *""Wtf bro, I'm a girl.""* he literally say's *""Shouldn't be lookin like a man then""*. 

I've been in mma for a while, but it took all I had to get his mean ass out of that situation. He was damn near ready to pull out his fucking gun. *Over a god damn whistle*.
