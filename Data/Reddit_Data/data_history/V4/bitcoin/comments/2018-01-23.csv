I’m sure this has more to do with Coinbase internal review policies or huge accounting error than BSA laws. Some risk officer at Coinbase probably thought it would be a good risk control to require transaction reviews past a certain threshold. Or maybe Dale from the wire department screwed up a batch. Most instance of BSA/OFAC transaction holds are due to potential OFAC/SDN hits. These hits occur when an individual or company is linked to a name on a watchlist (terrorist, Interpol etc). Some other instance can include fraud, but the BSA is only trying to establish a paper trail for cash transactions. For example if you walk in to a bank with $10k cash the bank teller will ask you some questions and then process your transaction. If you refuse to answer then they will process your transaction and file a suspicious transaction report (much worst). These reports are reviewed and if the BSA officer of the bank decides to report you to the Feds (FiNCEn) then a SAR is filed. If the Feds receive enough complaints (SAR) they will Penetrate your life with the LONG DICK OF THE LAW. The bank won’t hold the transactions for this sort of thing. ;1;0;False;fistfullofcashews;dt45nlo;***** WARNING ****** DO NOT SEND ANY (LARGE) SUMS TO COINBASE. $40,000 wire transfer missing since 12/18 with ZERO response;7rfwec;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7rfwec/warning_do_not_send_any_large_sums_to_coinbase/

"Firstly, I'm not sure where you assumed day trading from my post. In the last couple of weeks, BTC dropped to $10000, went up to $17000, dropped to $9000, then back up to $13000. That's 2 trades. It's just smart financially if you have the ability to pull it off.

Secondly, the liquidity of BTC has never been an issue for me. More people trading increases liquidity and, to be honest, the more volatile the market, the more you can make at certain times. That's why Cryptopia's charts have more gaps and are more messy than Bittrex's for example.

"That is a misleading question. If something is banned, it may be pushed into the black market due to demand that still exists for that item. Technically, the price goes up for that good, but as that good becomes illegitimate (illegal/banned), the overall amount of demand dramatically goes down, as most people do not wish to participate in illegal activities. The increase in price represents the risk involved in dealing with the item, not the increase in demand or value of the item. 

Sometimes, being banned or illegal can actually lower the value of items. A good example of that is stolen property, which often has to be ""fenced"" to people or businesses (ex: a shady pawn shop that doesn't shy away from selling stolen goods). When an item is ""fenced"", it is dramatically lower in value than a legitimate item. 

Another example would be the market for banned firearms in Australia. Australia enacted new gun legislation in the mid-90's which required citizens to turn in many of their firearms and dramatically restricted the purchase of new firearms. Today, if you tried to buy a banned firearm (ie: black market) in Australia, they are probably available, but are very expensive. However, most people turned in their firearms as they were legally required to, so the overall availability and ""value"" of second-hand firearms in Australia is dramatically lower.

"Not true we care the most about personality by far, that takes up most of our pie chart. Then depending on the girl and her level of materialism or interests they either look at aesthetics or financial stability second. Of course there are women who are exceptions to this, but they aren't terribly common. We hate, hate, hate guys who want a ""mother"" or ""maid"" instead of a girlfriend. So if the guy has a great personality and treats us like a partner we are happy. Of course anyone male or female enjoys the idea of their partner making at least 45K a year, but that isn't usually a dealbreaker and certainly not something most people ask or think about on the first couple of dates. The amount of wealth isn't as important as having a steady job and adulting.  It is more important the person has a career in general. Financial stability is important for your future, and your partner wanting that isn't out of materialism, but being practical.

 I have turned down a few wealthy guys because their personalities were horrid even though they were conventionally attractive and outright stated they would pay for everything. As if their wealth was enough to sway me to be their girlfriend and overlook the fact that they treated other people horribly. I'd rather pay for my own gilded lobster suit then have to listen to their inane drivel for years. So remember to work on how you treat others including your partners, increase your self awareness and consideration as that has biggest impact on whether you will attract women.

"**Martingale (betting system)**

A martingale is any of a class of betting strategies that originated from and were popular in 18th century France. The simplest of these strategies was designed for a game in which the gambler wins his stake if a coin comes up heads and loses it if the coin comes up tails. The strategy had the gambler double his bet after every loss, so that the first win would recover all previous losses plus win a profit equal to the original stake. The martingale strategy has been applied to roulette as well, as the probability of hitting either red or black is close to 50%.

"Just zoom out. I repeat this so the time and even antonoplolous says this.  This revolution will be a series of bubbles. But just a straight line up.  IMO we are due for a bear market consultation cycle. I think if your a hodler it's time to stop checking because it's gonna go a lot more down before it goes up.  

Maybe in 6 months to a year as lightning channels get worked out and become ubiquitous. Rootstock smart contracts get going and maybe an ETF gets launched. Then Bitcoin will be ready for another parabolic move.

But we are about to get the mean time and it's gonna be painful if your looking at price every day.

You'll need more than a dollar, and, I would honestly look into other options if you're doing anything under $100, lets say that if you bought bitcoin at $10,000 USD, 100 dollars worth, once it goes to $20,000, that would only be 200 dollars, which is nice, but the time that it takes to go from 10k to 20k will probably be awhile since it appears were in a bit of a bear market.

* A big exchange goes bankrupt taking everybody's assets with it.

* You can make the comment ""I just bought some bitcoin"" before a business meeting or at a party and reliably get a ""are you f*cking nuts?"" look from the room.

When all the Bitcoins have been mined, supply and demand will certainly come into play,

I never did care...I mean I always cared about Bitcoin and the  financial revolution that it slowly bringing about. But I never CARED about the cost of btc in USD. I only have a few hundred dollars worth of electricity invested in mining back in 2014. Then I unplugged the miner and didn't even look at btc for nearly 3 years. Fast forward to 2017 when my gal asked if I ever heard of btc and that it's x price in USD. I was like holy shit! Now I only buy 25-50 dollars of btc a month. So  no matter what markets do I still hold btc and have enough fiat to pay bills. So nope I don't care either.

"Is there ever a point where you’ll reconsider this strategy? I’m just curious to understand the logic behind the “double down” method, since it doesn’t really exist with equities or most other investments. Usually an investor will set a valuation on an asset they buy and reassess their investing strategy based on how the market moves. 

Doubling down does exist in gambling but that’s a moot point I’d suppose. 

Do you just believe the value of BTC is endless/much much higher than the market says it is and so you’ll keep buying until it hits your valuation? What is that point?

If a government began torturing people to extract their bitcoins, I don't think that would cause the price of Bitcoin to crash, I think it would cement the need for the separation of cash and state.

"You would have to believe so strongly in bitcoin that you see no reason to keep the money elsewhere unless you need to liquidate for something.  I don't agree, but I can understand it.  

You're coming from the logic that I share, that this is way too volatile to hold forever.  It's not as safe as an index fund or bonds.  If I didn't cash out my holdings at $600 and stop paying attention to btc for over a year, I would probably have been cashing out 20-50% of it at some point soon after the recent ATH drop.  The rest let it ride.

Also, despite all the ""HODL!!!!"" talk you hear, long time holders cashing out is a very simple explanation for why you see wild volatility like this after a crazy all time high.  If you bought a bunch of coin at $600, seeing it dropping from an all time high of almost $20k sounds like a great time to exit.";1;0;False;vaporvendor;dt3b2oo;I don't care anymore.;7s5yjd;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7s5yjd/i_dont_care_anymore/

"It really depends. If you use term deposits, in my country at least you can expect 3% interest currently. If you've got around 2 million, that's around $60,000 a year in interest. That's more than enough for most people to live comfortably. At 10 million, I wouldn't even care too much about interest since I'd never spend all that money. 

$60K would be less than what I am earning right now to be fair, but if I were given the option to not have to work and have 2 million in the bank with a steady 3% interest on it every year, you can bet I'd take it up in a heartbeat.

Alternatively, if you're looking for better returns, stocks will probably do a lot better than 3% so you'd need less money to get the same return. It all really depends on how extravagant your lifestyle is. I live rather simply so I save a big percentage of my paycheck as it is so if I earned less from interest, I wouldn't be too concerned as it would be unlikely to affect my lifestyle.";2;0;False;;dt3ngxu;I don't care anymore.;7s5yjd;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7s5yjd/i_dont_care_anymore/

I am a busy professional that enjoys working.  I really believe that bitcoin will be worth >100k each someday.  Prior to my investment in BTC I was already multi-millionaire.  BTC just made possible to retire very easy.  I just like doing things the hard way.  I don't expect people to believe me.  That's fine.  Life is not about ease it is about what you do with what you are given.  I feel that I have been given a lot and consequently think I should give a lot back.

"If scenarios are stupid and don't apply to anyone.

If I played the 2008 stock crash and played every single Bitcoin dip and peak I would be the richest man on the planet right now.

If I bet my house on green last time I was at the roulette table I would have enough to support myself and the rest of my extended family for life.

Basing your investment off of what if bullshit is stupid and how you lose money. Yeah a lot of people probably have more Bitcoin than before the dip because they traded it properly, but I guarantee more people lost Bitcoin because they didn't trade it correctly and sold low and bought high. Nobody on this earth is a clairvoyant.

I'm holding because 1. I can afford to lose the money I put into it and 2. I am too stupid and inexperienced to profit off of daytrading, yes it would suck if Bitcoin and all cryptos took a huge nosedive and never recovered but I would easily survive the hit, I know there is at least someone out there who has a shit ton of money in Bitcoin and this dip could cost them half of their investment, saying ""if you just sold at the peak and bought at the dip you would have made money"" is focusing on an event that will never change, and doesn't determine anything to come. 

If someone wants to sell then let them sell, I personally trust in Bitcoin and what it strives to be, nobody will know what the correct course of action will be until next year.

As for the emotion standing, even the rules you make are determined from your emotions, we are humans and are emotion centered beings, the only people who can function like robots are sociopaths and robots, everyone else has an emotional tie to everything they do which is what fuels the what if scenarios.";3;0;False;Ju1cY_0n3;dt3doab;I don't care anymore.;7s5yjd;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7s5yjd/i_dont_care_anymore/

I'm an Ethereum and Bitcoin guy. And I don't believe those two are directly competitors. Bitcoin is great because it's tried and true. No one has ever broken the actual blockchain and stolen money after all these years. Think about that, it's never been hacked. I often wonder what, if any, cryptanalysts have tried to break into something like Vechain or Tron. People are so busy buying new coins that I sometimes wonder if there's any technical foundation there. I'm not a tech genius but I know enough to know that if these alts can be cracked by someone that will simply walk off with all the tokens, they have no value EVEN IF the concept behind them is great. ;4;0;False;I_am_Jax_account;dt3cz3a;I don't care anymore.;7s5yjd;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7s5yjd/i_dont_care_anymore/

"Doubling down is just a term from gambling used because investing in a volatile unregulated market is gambling. What they are doing is not necessarily doubling their holding, but buying at lower values to bring the average price of their holdings down. It's actually a very common tactic with stocks when you are planning on going long (hodling).  What it does is give a slight bit of extra security if you are wrong on your long term projection, get cold feet and want to exit, or need to cash out your holdings for any reason, then if the market value is at or above your average, you break even despite that you bought some at $19,000.

The math (using round numbers for simplicity).  You get all excited over the moon rocket and buy in with 1.0btc at $17,000.  You miss the exit at 19,200 and decide to hodl. You see it crash to $10,000. Instead of panicking You spend less cash than before but now buy 1.5btc.  Your average price is now (17000×1+10000×1.5)/(1+1.5)=12800.  So despite buying so much at a high price the average cost is now 12,800. Now instead of having to wait to get back to $17,000 to break even if btc reaches 12800 you can cash out and not lose a penny and reaching 17000 means lots of profits, and if the moon? Get your lambos ready.";2;0;False;skiman13579;dt3wvmr;I don't care anymore.;7s5yjd;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7s5yjd/i_dont_care_anymore/

It's not like you guys pretending to get informed have any fuckin clue of the code quality or the math and logic behind this networks.

Not even to mention how many bullshit argument I hear everyday:
""ark is great because it will connect all other blockchains"".

Even if it does, who cares? There's atomic swap, automated contracts on Ethereum that already do that, and well, exchanges?

Also, how the hell does an Ark holder benefit from people using the ark network to exchange their ETH for BTC?

Or all the ""siacoin is great because it's decentralized"". Who fuckin cares it is? Did you even ask yourself if there's even a need for decentralized storage at all? Who is really the client of such a service? What's the difference between decentralizing your files and encrypting them with some sha-512 and put them on motherfuckin free dropbox and similar services?

BAT? You seriously believe people will install and use that browser safe for some bat holder?

You guys fuckin pretend to get informed yet 99% of you, when you speak, seem absolutely detached from reality.

Not even to mention, why would a person buy bitcoins with their dollars to use bitcoins where he already can use its dollars?

So what's the purpose of Bitcoin, really. Also, how does its deflative nature would make it a viable coin? Deflation suppresses spending and promotes hoarding because you know that the amount is fixed.

"Cryptos enter your brain man, it's volatile and I was a day trader so staring at book order and graphs was my way of life and impacted me negatively.

Out on a dinner? Still checking blockfolio like every 20 minutes top. In gym? Check blockfolio every rep.

The worst was going sleep without knowing what I'd wake up. And waking up rushing to blockfolio again.

I just couldn't handle it anymore. It affected my sleep cycle to a great extent.

Holding was not a thing for me either, as I thought I had good profit already and I thought the market was, imho, way overpriced. Maybe I was wrong, but to me 500billions of market cap sounded very crazy and the rampant greediness and detachment from reality of so called ""investors"" was making me more aware of wanting to leave.

Mind you, I still believe the blockchain is a great technology that might change the world, but I see way too much greediness and way too little use.

In the end I made more or less what I make in an year at work, I call myself happy.

"Trading is more akin to gambling than investing. The difference for me is that gambling involves random chance and investing still involves chance (otherwise there's no risk), but it's less random and an investment is driven by a thesis. To me, a good thesis is something like ""Given the previous quarter's profits vs. where the stock is trading, I think this stock is undervalued in the long term"". A bad thesis is something like ""I drew fibonacci spirals on a chart and it said this stock is going up 10x next week"".

Right, but you have less control over the outcome of an investment than you do the actions of the other players in the poker game. You maybe have greater predictability, but you can't bluff a market into acting a certain way, at least not alone. So you are making informed gambles. What you control is how much you invest/bet on the desired outcome. To me it's no different. Some gambling is just longer term.;1;0;False;OBOSOB;dt4qxme;Every new crypto investor!;7scwk5;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQegMA_kY9Y

"Maybe, it's just numerous studies have shown that loss is much more hurtful than never having.

To use a crypto example, I put $100 in Ether and then sold it for $10,000.  If ether crashed and I only sold it for $200, I would absolutely not be saying ""Hey, $100 for free!"".  I'd have been devastated.

So it depends on what you think you can handle.  I didn't get in to crypto to make money.  I was hoping to be able to use it.  It's not my investment style at all.  I don't have the tolerance for that sort of risk.  My guess is many others don't either, but they just don't think about what would happen if bitcoin crashed to zero.

"Yeah, I came for the Drunk Questions videos and hung around for the sketches. He's consistently funny.

Also, he recently starred in a Netflix original series called American Vandal, which (despite being based around a premise that sounds too-dumb-to-watch) was legitimately hilarious pretty much the whole way through. He is also getting movie deals these days, I think. Good to see him on the up and up, dude deserves it.";85;5;False;thieflar;dt3wxl8;Every new crypto investor!;7scwk5;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQegMA_kY9Y

I understand and appreciate the value in cryptocurrency albeit there are still flaws and challenges to overcome. However the idea of investing in cryptocurrency just Escapes Me. It seems like the equivalent of penny stocks worst case or regular stocks best case scenario. At any rate it seems way too risky and speculative for 99 % of people. ;1;0;False;clkou;dt4whtk;Every new crypto investor!;7scwk5;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQegMA_kY9Y

"This is the real ""new investor"". -- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ednsMWsbbKA

Gets on Coinbase, sees three coins for trading, gets in on ETH and then LTC. *(Probably thought BTC was too expensive.)*

Then makes a long drawn-out video about trading with your ""gut feel"" and feeling guilty for making profits.

His answer? He'll just hunker down and work for someone else the rest of his life.

The title is misleading since he didn't even touch BTC, but that's the icing on the fail-cake.
