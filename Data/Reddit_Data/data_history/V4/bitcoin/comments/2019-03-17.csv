My Ally checking ATM fees are $2.95, but I get $10/mo refunded anyway. Barring that, it's *completely* up to customers to bank with another company and use that company's ATMs.  

But really, OP's submission is just juvenile. People are switching to using card more and more. The last few times I went to a restaurant with coworkers and friends, none of us paid in cash. It was all card. One could argue that this trend toward everyone using card is going to make it way easier to transition to cryptos in our lifetime.

Most banks in Ireland charge a fee to withdraw cash from an ATM.   The fee is charged by the bank rather than the ATM operator, so if you use a British card in an Irish ATM is no fee, but an Irish card at an Irish ATM will charge you a few cents on the euro.  The fee does have a yearly cap (I think it's €5) but was quite controversial when introduced

"I was thinking recently and I realized how much better it is to encourage Free Services for owners of Bitcoins vs merchandising.

Like ""Free ATM"" is because they have other fees, law of averages, etc. But there is the 'unspoken' requirement of having $500 in USD to get access (same for Bill Pay services, etc).

Managing $1,000 USD has ATM, Bank, Credit Card, Check, Bill Pay, Paypal, Mortgage options whereas BTC has:

* LocalBitcoins + Meetups for Bank like services

* Can't really do Mortgages, Credit Cards (too volatile - technically you could but interest rates might be over 40%).

* BTCPay for Paypal like services

LocalBitcoins and Meetups aren't close to the level of ease and convenience of an ATM. There is probably an easy way to set up an automated system where people swipe a credit card + pay the 3% fee to get Bitcoins (or a paypal address to sell Bitcoins - maybe Square will do this?). If you advertised $100 or less 'no fee', this would be comparable to ATMs.

I bet this could setup for $200 one-time outside an office without any increase in crime. Credit Swiper + IPad + Basic Software should be all that is needed, with BTC sent to customer via email or accessed via a login.

The person whose business it is at would supply the power, internet, plus the initial Bitcoins to take care of $100 or less buyers... purchases bigger than that can get charged fees say $5 per $100 to reward the business owner.

Cheap investment to drive traffic, offers customers a 'lotto purchase' as they go out the door, and VASTLY improves the BTC network as you could easily have thousands of these setup worldwide for easy access to $100 of BTC / USD ""For Free"", kind of like the Supercharger system (lots of free *slow* charging for electric cars) or ATM.

This sort of infrastructure improvement is likely more important than any codebase improvement, for increase the value of a Bitcoin.

"But you're not getting your own money.

You're using a private machine, that's giving you physical cash.

That's a service and you pay for a service.

It costs money to maintain these machines and maintain security/withstand attacks.

It's incredulous that you think these things should be absolutely free/no cost involved, $3 is a bit of money but these machines cost $ and cash is accepted everywhere. Cypto isn't so to offer a secure and dependable accessible product it costs money.

But I do agree it would be nice if everywhere accepted cypto.

But, even bitcoin cost you to spend it.

Stop acting like things happen with no cost at all and that's normal.

Maybe in the future we'll have virtually free transactions, but there's still a network to secure and maintain, a internet to pay for and machines/PCs/mobile phones to buy and use to utilise these coins.

So yeah at what point was your money ever completely free/ without some sort of cost involved?

Okay $3 is a lot, but it's not easy to offer secure physical cash in the real world and that's why these machines exist, because cash is king.";13;0;False;1one1one;eirfr32;So you don't get robbed...;b26qxy;https://i.redd.it/riv6dcyoepm21.jpg
