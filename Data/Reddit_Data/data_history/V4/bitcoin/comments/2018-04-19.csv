"While being mostly true this is far from foolproof and a fuckload of work for a very mediocre result. 

The real answer is using an actual privacy coin. 

Verge is pure garbage for one of a dozen reasons, pick any 3 really. Monero is not as secure as it once was with the forking resulting in groups gaining potentially deanonymizing power over the blockchain (monerox for example). Onion coin (think tor coin), zclassic / zcash (Snowden's favorites) and bitcoin private (btcp, same teams as zcl) are currently the only ways to truly retain trustless anonymity.

"> In order to have true decentralization communication in the form of transactions must be highly protected and private to the level of satisfaction of its users.

This seems like you're massaging the definition of centralisation as most involved with crypto understand it. Typically the issue is around participation, i.e. can more and varied individuals participate in the operation of the network, if so, that's more decentralised. This means hardware requirements being lower enables more decentralisation. Completely hiding the identity of transacting parties would require a lot of more data, if you thought the 2X debate was fierce, imagine how the arguments over increasing the size of the blockchain to allow for ring signatures would be. To keep using Monero as the example, even with pruning, for the same volume of transactions, the size of blocks would be much larger than Bitcoin.

Sales tax for products is somewhat more easy to collect because stores (physical or web based) can be raided. Also products are produced and they can be counted by the tax authority, so the tax it's harder to avoid.  

Sales tax for human  services is almost impossible to enforce and relies on people declaring them, again: unless they abolish cash and all other cash-like alternatives like bitcoin

I personally use Amazon because of the insane reliability of their shipping. As a guy that once owned and ran a multi million pound logistics company I can tell you their setup is jaw dropping.

I agree completely about your choice of crypto, but that is not the point in my personal opinion. Blockchain is a means to establish decentralization. In order to have true decentralized communication in the form of transactions, they must be highly protected and private to the level of satisfaction of its users.

Sounds as if they treat it like every bitcoin user has 1 address. With HD wallets you actually have an endless chain of addresses. So a real users wallet will likely contain several addresses. If I send a friend bitcoin for a beer, some goes to the friend's new address, some goes to a new change address of mine. To the outside observer you cannot tell which is which, you've got a 50% chance at being right. After a few real case uses like this the chain of who's coins are who's becomes more and more uncertain. The address tagged with my data is likely to never be used again.;83;5;False;mabezard;dxmb12w;Amazon filed a patent to de-anonymize Bitcoin transactions and sell the data to law enforcement;8dc65s;http://darkcitycrypto.com/index.php/2018/04/19/amazon-filed-a-patent-to-de-anonymize-bitcoin-transactions-and-sell-the-data-to-law-enforcement/

"Don't sweat this. It is inevitable.

As Vinay Gupta has pointed out, government is not going to be excluded from crypto. On the contrary, they will demand their slice of the pie, and they are able to get it. There is no point in fighting this. If crypto is ever going to be mainstream, it WILL be just as transparent as existing banking, and for the same reasons. All sorts of firms will devise all sorts of ways to attach identity data to transactions - very possibly retrospectively.  

The big win here, it we can get mass adoption, is a monetary system that no government can abuse or interfere with. If Bitcoin, or Ether, or any other coin, becomes massive, at the very least it will force some big governments to be much more disciplined in their monetary and fiscal policy. I dare say some governments will abandon their fiats altogether in favour of crypto. (and once a central bank, somewhere, starts buying Bitcoin, the game will be forever changed - what a day that will be).

I wonder how long the public will allow and consent to this data collecting that can be aggregated for surveillance by corporations that serve customers. You really think LE needs Amazon for this and LE is the only intended customer?  This isn't about just Bitcoin, no about more private systems. This is about a public company collecting data from the data marketplace and creating profile for LE. Time to decide where you spend your money and what you will tolerate.

Obviously the government would be able to subscribe. Why wouldn't they?

> A group of telecommunications providers may subscribe downstream to the combined data stream and be able to correlate the IP (Internet Protocol) addresses of the transactions to countries of origin. Government agencies may be able to subscribe downstream and correlate tax transaction data to help identify transaction participants. 



the entire point of this is to collate bitcoin addresses. if you use bitcoin to buy something and get a shipping address. amazon would store that in a database (no shit) and share that with all of their vendors (also no shit). If you opt in to being identifiable, you will be identified. Amazon is proposing a way to store that.

I mean, blockchain has certain addresses labelled already.


This implies that amazon would be directly taking bitcoin payments, because if they were using a payment processor the coin would not be coming from ""your"" wallet.

"Because its pretty much common sense that you will be de-anonymised when you want to purchase a good and have it delivered at your address because....well you entered your address, its as simple as that. When you buy something on Amazon your credit card and address get saved in a database, all they have to do is look up your account in the database and pull that up, they can do that with crypto as well as if you enter in a crypto address as payment, Amazon knows you're using crypto and can type that public address onto a block explorer and follow your money. Same way if an employer pays you in Bitcoin he/she will be able to see your entire balance and how much you tend to move from one address to another. Lightning Network is a blessing but I think Bitocin should have never been open in the first place, maybe that was the best design at the time and was a compromise so as to not get it immediately banned by the govt.

People are talking about not attributing wallets because that's really the only solution and really all that matters, this whole patent was already known, you can track people without these patent as you are associating a bitcoin address with a physical address. For every purchase you make, a different LN payment that way the only thing Amazon, Company X, Company Y, see is an address that had specified an amount of Bitcoin exact to their Amazon cost total. In this way, Amazon knows you use crypto but they don't know how much your total money in crypto is and where you send it to. There is nothing wrong with that, Bitcoin alone allows for the things  just said which LN prevents which is bad.";2;0;False;;dxmj6fu;Amazon filed a patent to de-anonymize Bitcoin transactions and sell the data to law enforcement;8dc65s;http://darkcitycrypto.com/index.php/2018/04/19/amazon-filed-a-patent-to-de-anonymize-bitcoin-transactions-and-sell-the-data-to-law-enforcement/

"Enron created various entities to shuffle around losses while booking future earnings from projects as present revenue.  At the same time they pinned their own company investments to their stock so as the stock rose from inflated estimations so did all the bonuses the employees received in addition to the capital gains from stock options and the what not.

Amazon does the exact same thing except they enter new industries, create high barres to entry through technology innovations, patents and huge war chests.  All for the purpose of booking future revenue as future earnings projected as value into the stock price which is jacked up by Bezos' buddies on Wallstreet who profit insanely from the capital gains. All while Bezos' hides the fact he has his finger in almost every internet outlet or business and controls a huge media empire that is growing in which to push the ""retail apocolypse"" all while fleecing UPS, USPS and FedEX of billions of dollars of shipping revenue.  

Their original business model was based on not having to pay tax.  That loophole closed several years ago thanks to Texas Comptroller.  Now their business model is divide, conquer, project, jackup price, and keep the spin going.

"Lightning also offers significantly better privacy than the base bitcoin blockchain. It's not as good as monero in privacy terms, but it's a nice bonus, that using lightning hides more about your transacting than plain bitcoin transactions. It may even be possible to foil analysis of your transactions by creating two nodes, funding one, and sending the btc to the other. At that point, it's extremely difficult to link the two nodes together, and will only really be possible if the attacker is able to surveil you in other ways, such as having spyware on your computer or some kind of visibility of accounts used to spin up servers or something. 

If you're super paranoid, you could open and fund one node using tor, and only access and close the second, receiving node on a fresh tor connection. Timing attacks then become your only real online attack vector, which is already true of tor anyway.

"Lightning is a counter measure. Cant track ""promises"" of payments in Bitcoin that aren't stored in a database. You either have the tx to broadcast and get some BTC out of a channel, or you dont... also nobody knows who's promise is being routed around the network because only the final hop knows if it is the recipient or not. Great stuff. CHEAP AND SECURE payments. Sounds like digital cash again. 

Now if they can just get us some wallets working worth a shit. I've tried eclair several times and I can never find a route to blockstream (SLEEPYARK) to get a payment to them to buy a sticker.... so yeah.

The problem with cryptos is that they are not an established technology yet. It is still being developed so in itself is not being trusted. It's in speculation phase, if it gets out of it unscathed (i.e. without any major hack/attack) big institutions would start trusting it more readily. Nobody wants (or needs) to lose a percentage of its wealth in financial crime, for better or worse an ideal blockchain stops *exactly* that.

Blockchain ledger technology has the potential to remove this lack of trust, and ensure the funds are only accessible by the intended party.

The real question is: do governments have the appetite to adopt this change or would they rather the lack of trust was still in place? I suspect we all know the answer to this.

That would be true if I could choose to stay away from welfare benefits and only pay the strictly necessary spending like infrastructure and then be responsible for myself. Now I got a government that others elect that is aiming at 40% of my salary in income taxes and I don't even make a lot much, plus capital gains taxes, plus consumption taxes, plus plus plus... Is never enough... This is not my choice because I cannot opt out. Also this government forces me to use a fiat currency which is constantly losing value and makes me pay capital gains taxes if I use other forms of money.;13;1;False;lazarus_free;dxm634m;Amazon filed a patent to de-anonymize Bitcoin transactions and sell the data to law enforcement;8dc65s;http://darkcitycrypto.com/index.php/2018/04/19/amazon-filed-a-patent-to-de-anonymize-bitcoin-transactions-and-sell-the-data-to-law-enforcement/

When Final Fantasy 6 was originally released in the US, it was called Final Fantasy 3 (the same happened for FF4 in Japan, which was released in US as FF2). With the release of FF7, they made the games match up. Also, every release of FF6 in the US other than the original SNES version (and what's on the SNES Classic) is just 6 now.;2;1;False;nochilinopity;dxmpqg7;When your favorite game hinted that you should have bought bitcoin before it even existed in 1994;8cixgc;https://i.redd.it/nhlvfpgoi5s01.jpg
