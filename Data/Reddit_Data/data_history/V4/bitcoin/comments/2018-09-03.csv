I try to explain. First i got known to bitcoin it was pretty new. At the time i understood that banking was bad, i liked the tech. I even played around with it. Calculated about mining etc. But i decided somehow to not really do anything with it.
Then there was a big parabolic rise, i got (because of the price) again interested and started to read even more. But i still didn't get in (i bought like 20usd to try)! Only in the beginning of last year it started to read once again and became really hooked to it.

"Just another foothill. If you cherrypick January as your starting point all you see is down. That's a form of selection bias. Consider the whole timeline if you want to think about price. Bitcoin regularly goes through media hype cycles every couple of years, booms and then consolidates in price, then slowly paces onward. I've personally seen 3 of these cycles since 2011. Part of what fuels them is the halving of mining payouts every ~4 years which tightens supply. Demand then overreacts with hype. 

When you look at other metrics beyond price, like network growth, lightning network growth, media attitudes, global regulatory adoption, it's consistently advancing. Bitcoin isn't some company you ""invest"" in that potentially goes belly up or potentially does well.

"There is only 1 state where this is the couple's decision:  Alaska is an opt-in state.    Otherwise,  if you live in a community property state,  then the couple is an entity and all money and property earned from business or acquired while you are married and any earnings from investment on community property is legally owned by the couple;  that's a 50% / 50% ownership.

So if your Wife only works part time, and you work a full time job for $100k.   That's 100k a year  Plus your wife's earnings legally owned equally by both husband and wife.

It's quite meaningless to speak of ""your money"",  or ""her money,  because  technically all the money belongs to both of you,   and if you decide to invest your share in Bitcoins while you're still married --- any earnings on the BTC are equally owned by both,  and  a share of the  income goes on both of your tax returns if you are filing separately.


If you want to agree as a couple  to  informally subdivide the earnings and assign designated personal spending to each partner and put a partner in charge of most  ""house spending"",  or  set a  ""rule of decency""  requiring approval by both partners for major  spends ----  you can  do all those things.     However,  **legally**  speaking,  you can't make the restriction ---  there is no  ""his money""  or  ""her money""    other than  premarital assets  that were never comingled.

Even if one partner managed to lasso the bank account ---  the other partner  can in fact open a credit card or take out a loan in the name of the couple,  and both partners are liable to cover the debts.
