I'm sure they don't care about 99.9999% of them.  The chances of them coming after you based on an internet post are effectively zero. But you're leaving a digital footprint that you may think is untraceable now.  And if/when computing power explodes (perhaps quantum computing) I think there's a decent chance that most everything people think is anonymous online could be revealed.  And at that point, it might not be difficult for someone to write an algorithm to find people who racked up crypto gains and didn't pay their taxes.  Also, it's entirely possible that someday something will happen that leads authorities to investigate you for completely unrelated reasons.

If you are making a deal with another party then an escrow service would be ideal for the exchange. I would presume that the buyer intends to pay for the property with bitcoin in full so I wouldn't complicate that.  Make the exchange, hire an attorney or use an escrow service.  Then once you have the bitcoin you can move towards an exchange and depending on how much you are moving can also arrange to sell the coins to the exchange directly rather than trading it on market, as moving large sums of BTC to usd can and quickly does changes its price.   Also Ideally you would want to make as few trades as possible on your coins as capital gains is a bitch so I would also hire a financial and tax advisor who can better assist in helping map out what the best course of action would be, and help you get down to the hard numbers of fiat you actually will need, which will help you decide on how you want to sell the coin.  A situation like yours could be very varied in the means to achieving  your goal. Depending on how much Fiat capital you need now, whether you would instead take out a mortgage or a loan, is this as a private entity or are you incorporated etc.  If you do decide or find you need to turn a large sum of BTC into USD, I would get in contact with at least several exchanges and see what their offerings are for corporate level accounts and large trades.  ;2;1;False;TRUMP_WALL_2016;ds1mbe5;TIL that the FBI seized 144,000 bitcoins from Ross Ulbricht (silk road guy) in 2013 following his arrest and conviction.

"Unfortunately logic is not your strong suit, but I'll spell it out for you. 

>If you believe taxation is theft then you must unavoidably be okay with anyone murdering you with no consequences

>If ... taxation is theft then you ... must be okay with murder [because taxes pay for defense services and a legal system]

Implies 

>If taxation is theft then you must be okay with starving where food is socialized [because taxes pay for groceries].

Even though you could voluntarily pay for groceries instead of paying for them under the threat of violence.

>If taxation is theft then you must be okay with leaving shit in your house because taxes pay for the sewers. 

Even though private sewer systems do exist and decentralized solutions like septic tanks work well too, and are paid for voluntarily without the threat of violence. 

So, in the same light, I can be opposed to theft and murder and be in favor of defense of innocents, because there are ways to defend yourself and others that don't involve stealing from everyone on a prolific scale (such as learning martial arts, being risk averse, putting better locks on your door, hiring a body guard, visiting establishments that have private armed security over those with rampant muggings, etc, all of which are voluntary decisions).

"Google ""economic calculation problem"". I'd rather live in a country where people throw away food than Venezuela. 

Socialism is mathematically guaranteed to starve people because you can't calculate whether the demand for something is greater than the cost of producing it when resources have no prices. And resources have no prices to the government, because it just appropriates whatever it needs.

Example: if a taxi business steals all the cars in town, they have no cost of production because they didn't have to buy the cars. The taxi business will make a profit if they only provide one cab ride. Even though their actions immobilized an entire town and they never provided a legitimate service, they still make a profit and have no incentive to stop doing what they're doing.

That's why it's already illegal to commit socialism for all of us.";0;0;False;;ds1ngle;TIL that the FBI seized 144,000 bitcoins from Ross Ulbricht (silk road guy) in 2013 following his arrest and conviction.

"Exactly. It's absurd to think that anyone would pay if it were voluntary.

I just find it strange how much people defend an action that must be enforced with violence as just and reasonable. 

It's amazing what this sub has turned into. If you love paying taxes so much - pay extra! Nothing is stopping you.

>Take, say, April 15th. In a functioning democratic society that would be a day of celebration, the day you hand in your taxes. You would be saying: ‘Alright, we got together, we worked out some plans and programs that we think ought to be implemented and we’re now participating in providing the funding to get these things done.’ That’s a democracy. In the United States it’s a day of mourning. It’s a day when this alien force, you know, the government, which comes from Mars or somewhere is arriving to steal from us our hard earned money and use it for their own purposes, whatever they are. That’s a reflection of the fact that the concept of democracy is not even in people’s minds anymore. Now, I’m exaggerating. It’s not quite this sharp, but it’s pretty close.

"**Civil forfeiture in the United States**

Civil forfeiture in the United States, also called civil asset forfeiture or civil judicial forfeiture or occasionally civil seizure, is a controversial legal process in which law enforcement officers take assets from persons suspected of involvement with crime or illegal activity without necessarily charging the owners with wrongdoing. While civil procedure, as opposed to criminal procedure, generally involves a dispute between two private citizens, civil forfeiture involves a dispute between law enforcement and property such as a pile of cash or a house or a boat, such that the thing is suspected of being involved in a crime. To get back the seized property, owners must prove it was not involved in criminal activity. Sometimes it can mean a threat to seize property as well as the act of seizure itself.

For example, let's say you bought 3 Bitcoin for $10 each. Bitcoin hits $1,000 and you use .1BTC to buy a $100 Amazon gift card. You then own capital gains taxes on the price the Bitcoin appreciated, in this example, it's $99. 

This is agnostic of any sales tax you may pay on the goods or services being purchased. You pay taxes on the appreciation of your Bitcoin, regardless of it exchanged for fiat, or goods and services.

"> People still fucking die to drugs every day.

Is anyone forcing these people to do drugs? No, it's their own choice.

Silk Road provided a review system and relied on seller ratings. It was much safer than buying fucking fentanyl-laced shit off the streets. THAT'S how people die from drug use, so fuck right off your high horse and don't try to pretend you care about their safety. 

Ross is a brilliant mind, you can easily find proof of that by doing a little research on the guy. He would do far more good for society as a free man than locked up in a cage.

There was no human trafficking or other fucked up shit that actually caused harm to human beings on Silk Road.

"If I recall correctly, they waited for him to log into his laptop at the public library where he did most of his communications. Multiple federal agents approached him, immediately took his laptop and restrained him; because the laptop was on, the hard drive encryption he used was useless. 

At that point, it's relatively trivial to acquire everything on the computer, including passwords and private keys.

Had he had enough time to close his laptop or if an agent mishandled it/accidentally turned it off before a Computer Forensics Analyst could do a RAM capture on it, it would be virtually impossible to get anything off the laptop.

Pretty crazy how close of a call it was.

Lol at you bringing up the DPR, his entire defence was grasping at straws by dredging up alternative theories and creating smokescreens.

"Let's say you have $15mil in bitcoin.  You suddenly have a great business opportunity,  but you need to put up 200k in cash.  With the 10k/day rate,  it'll only take you 2 and a half months to take the 200k our and make it liquid.  By which time you've lost the opportunity. 

15mil would take you 16 years to take out at 10k/ day.

That limit is there for a reason,  and you can agree or disagree with that reason,  but to pretend it's not onerous is ridiculous; the *point* of it is to be onerous, inconvenient and slow.

"Mate, I've lived in the 'States, I'll take our freedom over your freedom any day, a freedom that won't be taken away by anyone, because you don't know Australia and you don't understand Australians.
Australia Day is on the 26th of January, always a good day for a Barby.

As for the greatest country in the world, may I quote the esteemed Darryl Kerrigan, ""You're  dreaming"".

Checked out your voting system recently? It's a joke.
Had a look at your health care system lately? talk about a 4th world system
You drive on the wrong side of the road and do it in Mph. instead of a civilised KM/h.
The biggest company in the world, Apple, an American company, has it's flagship consumables made in China and stores it's profits in Ireland.

Ever heard of a little place called China?

They sort of ruled the world for about 3500 years, they've had a bit of a dip in popularity over the last 750 years, but they're on the way up again.

If there was an exchange for nations I wouldn't be  investing in USA, there's much better pairs to trade.

"Haha nice, let's get right to the insults then.

I'm going to assume you didn't go to college, and probably barely graduated high school since you seem to not have a basic understanding of things.

Yes, engineers ""design a building to collapse into it's own footprint."" I'm not going to even bother to get academic links, because you're too dumb to understand them and you'll just blow them off as ""blah blah illuminati."" But if you want to, just google it, and stay away from any conspiracy websites. They're easy to find. 

I'm not an engineer today, but I thought I would be years ago. I took countless engineering classes. I've studied a lot on my own. And most importantly, I have common sense. 

By saying they're ""designed to collapse into their footprint"", we're not saying the engineers designed them to collapse. If you knew even the very first thing about engineering, which you clearly don't, you'd know that when you engineer something, you try to account for everything. It huge construction, civic engineering, you account to failure. If this building collapses, what will happen? If we design it this way, it will fall sideways like a tree and destroy a quarter of manhattan. If it falls into itself, it will only damage surrounding buildings. Let's design it collapse into itself in the untimely event of catastrophic failure. So they do, like with nearly every other high rise.

Of course controlled demolitions collapse that way, too. That's because once again, that's how they were designed to collapse. The demolition team just rigs explosives at the right points to make it collapse in the first place.

You're one of those truly idiotic people that barely graduated high school, yet think they know more than everyone else because they read a couple conspiracy websites. Go educate yourself before insulting people. You're so stupid, it's sad.";1;0;False;Yodiddlyyo;ds1idt0;GREAT NEWS: In Australia, Bitcoin has just hit a YTD new high and the same is bound to happen in America in just a few hours!;7n8reu;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7n8reu/great_news_in_australia_bitcoin_has_just_hit_a/

"Why does uninsured per capita matter for QoL?

Australia has universal healthcare.

If you need to go to the hospital or doctors you don't pay anything for treatment or scans etc.

And if you want fast, extra care for non emergency visits you can pay or use private health insurance so either way you're set.

My family would've paid tens of thousands of dollars for our health problems and we were poor. I didnt have to pay for my cancer treatment and radiation and scans. Nor did I pay for my stint in drug rehab nor the weekly doctor appointments.

I only paid for medicine which was really cheap and my psychologist which was covered by like 70%.

Now I have private health and pay taxes because I and my family worked hard and didnt have a massive debt burden.

Likely people were saying building 7 was damaged and it was misreported as building 7 collapsed.

"I don't believe that 67% number, just because progressive collapse is much more complicated than a single number. Once you have parts of the building collapsing they can bring the rest down even when the rest is structurally sound.

It did actually get hit by quite a bit of aircraft and building debris. 

The twin towers were built to survive wind loads, but not while severely weakened. It's also worth noting that wind loads are lateral and loads from the buildings' weight are vertical, so it's a totally different set of stresses.

The buildings were designed for an impact from a 707 or smaller, unfueled. The empire State building was hit by a lost b-17 coming in for landing in the fog, so designers assumed a similar set of conditions but with an airliner available at the time. The actual planes were the much larger 767s, with much of their fuel still on board. 

My impression was that the van bombing might have been enough to take down a tower if it was done in another section of the parking lot closer to the foundations.  The explosion punched through a huge area on three or four floors. 

Your source states that no high rise has collapsed from fire, but they fail to mention that other high rise fires started from a point and spread outward, not lighting an entire floor on fire at once and destroying significant amounts of the insulation that would prevent weakening for a normal fire duration. I'm pretty sure the micro thermite was later disproven, but I don't have a good source for that because I'm on my phone.";6;1;False;Dilong-paradoxus;ds0opgo;GREAT NEWS: In Australia, Bitcoin has just hit a YTD new high and the same is bound to happen in America in just a few hours!;7n8reu;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7n8reu/great_news_in_australia_bitcoin_has_just_hit_a/

"What are your sources, you have none apparently. Lots of detail information as if you're an engineer that built skyscrapers. I know that's not true so don't bother saying...

Your impression of the car bombing is opposite of the engineer that built the building.

""I don't believe that 67% number,"" That's the standard and design the building was built to. Period.

How did the building cascade implode from... how did it collapse again, I'd like to know what you believe. It's some outlandish shit for sure.




""The exterior columns of the Twin Towers, for exam
-
ple, used only about 20% of their capacity to withstand 
gravity loads, leaving a large margin for the additional 
lateral loads that occur during high-wind and seismic 
events""


In the case of WTC 7, for example, the 
factor of safety was generally 3 or higher. Here, 67% of the 
strength would need to be lost for failure to ensue, which 
would require the steel to be heated to about 660°C);

"> generally you only keep fund roughly proportional to your expected liabilities in the foreign currencies, as anything else is basically currency speculation.

This is not true. Holding assets denominated in a variety of different currencies is less speculative than holding assets all in one currency. For example, suppose I held all my assets in USD. That would be far more risky (and speculative) than if I held all assets denominated half in USD and half, say, in euro. This is because the USD may depreciate against the euro.";1;1;False;tramselbiso;ds0ygr0;BitMex has just liquidated and distributed their Bitcoin Cash in the form of Bitcoin to their customers.;7n24lu;http://bitcoin-daytrading.com/bitmex-just-liquidated-distributed-bitcoin-cash-form-bitcoin-customers/

"No, it depends on your liabilities.

If all of your costs are in USD, holding half Euro adds risk because while the USD depreciates against the Euro might give you a profit, the Euro depreciating against the USD might leave you unable to meet your obligations. The latter can bankrupt you.
