"ASICS are only a few years old, hardly enough time for Economies of Scale to expand. Even large warehouses are having problems in terms of after a certain point you have extra costs like heating, employees, and slippage when selling large quantities of coin to make up daily operational costs. 

This has led to OTC partnerships and other deals to try and mitigate the risks but essentially the zero-sum game appears to be working. 

And also think about it this way: if we are going to build a global transaction system for other applications and infrastructure to be built on top of, I would hope that the network is steadfast (of which comes the benefits of the ASICS fight, much more security in the blockchain than beforehand). This network runs autonomously for anyone to freely use, which is much different than a closed off transaction network like paypal, mastercard, etc. 

Thus the benefits of this protocol, in my opinion, still greatly outweigh the ""inequality"" aspect. Sure, money allows greater participation in processing transactions, but anyone around the world can equally build on top of or use the network despite geography, nationality, creed, etc. Fleeting internet access is much more accessible on a global scale then fair banking institutions and payment networks.

"Hong Kong Protesters are using mesh-net on a widescale right now. Meshnets grow stronger with more users. The Old-School Traditional Internet is connected at the core through ""BackBones"" which are owned and operated by corporate, government, military interests. These backbones are centralized points of failure that can be exploited or manipulated. In addition, the cables and frequencies that the internet is transmitted over are owned by corporate/government interests, taking another point of control away from the people.

The Meshnet is a concept embodied by many technologies and services. The main idea is to use overlapping WiFi signals on cellphones, routers, laptops, etc to create a new Internet that cannot be censored or controlled. You may be saying to yourself ""But there will be many connectivity gaps and at some point the meshnet will need to connect to the traditional Internet"" This is where Bitcoin and the Cryptographic revolution come in.

Some Protocols for the Meshnet are now maturing, things like BitCloud, and MaidSafe. 

These Protocols incentivize people to provide bandwidth, storage, and servers to the meshnet. The protocols use cryptographic techniques that allow people to a) Prove that they something of value, harddrive space for instance, and b) Receive payment for providing the service.

The data on the meshnet is orders of magnitude more secure, both in privacy and in reliability. Data is encrypted and broken in millions or billions of bits and those bits are copied and spread throughout the meshnet like grains of sand. No one place stores a full copy of your data, yet many, many copies of your data exist.

The more traffic your facilitate on your network, the more Bitcoins (or ""local"" crypto) you are paid. The more space your provide for storage, the more cloud computing power, the more you are paid.

Just like Bitcoin mining, we will see an arms race to provide network connectivity, storage space, computing power, at cheaper and cheaper prices. The charts below are the amount of computing power invested into the Bitcoin network in the:

1) Past Year https://blockchain.info/charts/hash-rate
2) Past 2 Years https://blockchain.info/charts/hash-rate?timespan=2year&showDataPoints=false&daysAverageString=1&show_header=true&scale=0&address=

3) Past 5 Years  https://blockchain.info/charts/hash-rate?timespan=all&showDataPoints=false&daysAverageString=1&show_header=true&scale=0&address=

This is the kind of accelerated growth we will see when the Meshnet is given the proper incentives.

This is a real chance for meaningful revolution without any kind of war. I say it is a revolution because it overturns the control of information and financial systems.

It also empowers individuals to be paid by a non-human entity. You work for the protocol and the protocol rewards everyone fairly without taking a cut for itself. Yes, its still funded by humans paying into the system, but its a different kind of control system.

Information, Coinage, Employment. These systems are ripe for inversion. The traditional systems will simply become less relevant and the new systems more profitable, more relevant. It will be analogous to the industrial revolution. Agricultural and traditional jobs simply became less relevant compared to industrial jobs.

You might think to yourself ""The powers that be wont take this sitting down"" and I say to that; they are certainly running out of time to do anything about stopping it. The nature of these programs is that there is no single point of failure. In order to stop it they must stop everyone who is using these programs. And as they stop people, it becomes more and more profitable for those who keep running, just further incentivizing it. These programs are all open-source, which allows anyone to review the code at anytime. This results in secure code devoid of ""backdoors.""

At this point there are only 3 options I envision that will keep the Cryptographic revolution from occurring.

1) Solar Flare/Gamma Ray Burst/International Pandemic (Rare Life Ending Events; Non human based)
2) Outright War on Cryptography which ends in full Dark Age; Possible WW3
3) Quantum Computers developed in the future are able to decrypt classical encryption. However Quantum Computers would also be able to create unbreakable encryption, which could lead the way to a new Cryptographic revolution.

I see #3 as the most probable of these scenarios, but practical Quantum Computing is still decades out and even then we may be able to anticipate developments in Quantum Cryptography that allow a transition to the new system before opportunists. It would seem that if the first Cryptographic revolution is successful then Quantum Computers would be developed for the express purpose of aiding the Protocol rather than destroying it.


The Hong Kong Protests may be the ignition to set the revolution off. Meshnets need users, the more users, the stronger and faster they are. Once meshnets break a certain thresh-hold they will be an attractive Internet option.

Instead of paying an ISP, you will load Bitcoin into your Meshnet router. Each packet of data will have a tiny fraction of Bitcoin attached to it. You can offset your internet costs by making some harddrive space available or allowing your router to be used as a node to facilitate other peoples traffic.

Just because something has been Peer Reviewed doesn't mean its correct, just that it has been looked over by other knowledgeable professionals that agree it doesn't contain egregious logical or methodological errors.

When everyone is talking at the same time, no one can be heard. Throughput goes to zero.

Now eliminate the infrastructure and switch to mesh. The problems are compounded a hundred times, as now you have differing delay characteristics, differing transmission powers and receiver sensitivities, hidden and exposed node problems.

I really think the best approach (if you have low-level access) is to jam the jammer -- jammers work by overwhelming the signal with noise. So if you amplify the signal tremendously, you make it exponentially more difficult to jam. If you sync up all of the device clocks well enough and choose a slow enough transmit frequency, you could have each device repeating the traffic of another device, overwhelming the jammer.

"> And if you feel that the OS is, go rewrite it, there's no one stopping you.

I never said it was the OS that was insecure. Compromise a program,(bug, malicious developer, malicious packager) typically, you got the entire usespace.. Mandatory access control isnt that widespread yet, really wish package manages would tackle configuring them. Even with MAC, a bug in there is not impossible.

Really think the best route to more security is to drastically limit the number of places where vulnerabilities might lie. Thats why the approach i suggest, and might even try do, is to use a secondary computer where you can push the compromise between security and convenience much further towards security.

Your 'DIY' mentality is silly, btw. I mean, it is not like i am alone in wanting security, so i will tell people about this idea all i want.

"The hardware itself can be vulnerable, all it takes is the hardware manufacturing process to be compromised by state actors. If the vulnerability can be added asynchronously then there is no good reason not to exploit the hardware at this level. For example when moving data your CPU checks for a specific marker and if found it decrypts the next N bytes with the NSA's key, if they decrypt then they are executed. This means that the NSA *and only the NSA* can execute code on your processor by simply tricking it into reading some data.

If widely used it would cost the economy loads because nobody would trust foreign hardware (and governments really shouldn't), but in a war to, say, prevent Bitcoin from replacing the dollar it may be worth it.

"I think the routing part of it would be huge hurdle to overcome seeing as how phones move around constantly or shut off due to the battery dying or for any number of other reasons.  I feel a good chunk of available bandwidth would be used up just trying to keep track of how to send data around...and then what if a node moves out of range or is shut off while an image is being uploaded somewhere or something?  You'd have a massive delay while a new route is found.  

If I had to design a system like this, I'd probably come up with some sort of addressing scheme based on GPS coordinates so routes can be calculated based on geographic location easily.  Maybe something like have small ""cells"" (a few city blocks maybe) where your phone will keep a table of everyone in your cell, but if you want to reach outside of the cell, the route could be calculated by analyzing the destination address against your current location.  Device addresses would have to be updated often as they move around so a dynamic DNS system would have to be used too.  The more I think about it, the more complicated it gets.  And that's not even taking in to account battery life.

"Ultrasound would probably be a better bet, but it'd be crazy hard to devise a protocol capable of managing it because everyone would be trying to use the same communications channel and it would start to look like straight noise. You'd have to do some kind of crazy frequency modulation -- you'd probably need to do this with light as well.

"Hello LTE direct! Coming soon to a smartphone near you:

> LTE Direct is built on top of the LTE protocol that's already helping your smartphone connect to a cell tower and transfer data at high speeds. LTE Direct doesn't just talk to towers, though. Instead, it enables mobile devices to talk directly to each other, and at distances greater than 500 yards no less. This is much, much farther than what Wi-Fi and Bluetooth allow.

> With LTE Direct, however, it's possible to communicate with other phones or with nearby beacons without connecting to a tower. This allows for mesh networking on the fly.

Whether intentional (you're asking volunteers to use their free time to review code changes, after all - it's not infesible for them to miss an obfuscated backdoor inserted into a bug fix or code refactor) or not isn't my argument, just that the extra visibility is not being used well enough by the community.";8;2;False;bananabm;ckxdkc0;Protestors are using using a P2P mesh network (Firechat) in Hong Kong to coordinate and not get shut down.

"Meshnets are a great concept, but they'll never see the sort of speeds necessary to replace a proper ISP. 

Especially not without specialized hardware,  and, I just don't see that becoming likely. 

As a proof of concept, it's great,  but for any data transfer it often fails to do its job. 

They are also very hard to scale and regionally restricted. Nobody can run connections between different city nodes,  and it completely neglects rural areas. 

They're fantastic if you wanna take an interest in them and see what you can accomplish(and as an inter-city communication hub it's great) but they will never replace traditional ISPs.

"Keep this in mind though. In order to offset the cost of a connection you, let's say, give hard drive space. People with more cash on the outset can pay for extra hard drives just for this purpose. So it's inherently *not* fair.

Same goes for network speeds, the ones with money to buy high quality network devices and are going to get more transit traffic and therefore more digital coins.

This just leads to the same problem Bitcoin has now with mining democratization, Joe Sixpack can no longer just let his video card run this on it's down time. 3ish years ago maybe, but with developments in processing abilities of custom chips it's pretty hard to make money mining without spending significant resources on those custom mining rigs.

If meshnets will ever become a threat to ""the powers that be"" (which really simply means the people's majority), by far the most probable outcome will be tighter control on the hardware.
