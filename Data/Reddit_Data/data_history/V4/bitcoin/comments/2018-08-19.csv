"It's actually quite deceptively clever, maybe it doesn't translate very well but if you need to ask it means you don't know the answer, if you don't know the answer, you don't know your friend well enough and if you know your friend will lend you the money then you are actually telling them you need money and they are simply obliging. Therefore a true friend never asks for money.

">Gresham's law states that any circulating currency consisting of both ""good"" and ""bad"" money (both forms required to be accepted at equal value under legal tender law) quickly becomes dominated by the ""bad"" money. This is because people spending money will hand over the ""bad"" coins rather than the ""good"" ones, keeping the ""good"" ones for themselves.

"Your quote (from Wikipedia, AFAICT) confirms what I said. If the exchange rate between the two currencies is fixed by government decree, then people will prefer to spend whichever currency is really worth less than the fixed ratio (while the other currency is worth more and thus is better to be hoarded).

Gresham's Law was particularly applicable when the U.S. government was defining a ""dollar"" both as 1/20th of a troy ounce of gold and as 371.25 grains of silver. Since gold and silver are independent commodities, each with their own independent supply and demand, there is no way to force their actual market values into a fixed ratio, so when the government tried to fix their exchange rate, people tended to spend whichever one was being overvalued by the government's fixed exchange rate and hoard whichever one was being undervalued. Gold and silver swapped places as the popularly preferred medium of exchange several times, as gold's and silver's market values fluctuated independently, before bimetallism was finally abandoned.";7;1;False;whitslack;e4g1bmw;Behold my 20 Bitcoin lawnmower bought mid 2012;98gtdd;https://i.redd.it/kt0r50bahyg11.jpg

"You didn't read what i wrote, to ask also means you don't know what the answer is going to be, so really you're using ask in a very relaxed context when in fact you are actually telling someone your situation.

like asking if you can use the bathroom when you're in someone else's house, you're not really asking for permission per se, you're telling them you need directions to the toilet in a polite manner. Same with borrowing money, if you know the answer, then you are simply explaining the situation.
