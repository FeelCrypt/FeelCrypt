"**Stress Relief (The Office)**

""Stress Relief"" is a two-part episode of the American comedy television series The Office. They constituted the fourteenth and fifteenth episode of the fifth season, and the 86th and 87th overall episodes of the series. Both episodes were directed by Jeffrey Blitz and written by Paul Lieberstein, who also plays Toby Flenderson on the show.

In this episode, Dwight stages a fire in the office to test the office's fire safety skills, but things go from bad to worse when Stanley suffers a heart attack, causing Michael to come up with ways to relieve stress in the office, including a comedic roast of himself.

"I had a friend who had about 300 BTC a couple years back...He used them to buy weed/other drugs on the Silk Road. 

I always ask him ""remember when you had $6 million in bitcoin? (at peak price)""

I have been told to fuck myself hundreds of times by now.

Dude actually made multiple 10k pizza deals, as you can see discussed via Btalk.

this made me laugh out loud lmao just imagining the permanent black cloud of bitterness and deadness in the eyes. 100% would never be able to eat pizza again. I'd literally go into Vietnam flashbacks just seeing pizza.

I take it as a cautionary tale to not look at crypto in the short term.";269;5;False;j-shwift;dz2o54s;Walter White's confession about bitcoin;8jut80;https://i.imgur.com/BZgElgt.gifv
