"1700 BTC at 0.06$ is a mere 100$. I don't see any point in cashing out even at 1$. It's not a significant amount of money, anyway.

8$, on the other hand, would make it worth about 13k$, so it would be great to cash out 50&#37; of the gains, for example.

Point is, even if he cashed out 95&#37; at some point (or various points), he still would be sitting on a very impressive amount of money (about 425k$ by current BTC exchange rate).

Which means that all he needed to do is not to cash out everything. Especially considering that his initial investment was so small in the first place.";2;0;False;digital-state;e1jnltd;Don't be like Greg;8t9c6d;https://i.redd.it/7iu2c1vckq511.png

"When you bought at 19K, your ""investment"" is at a low point right.  Luckily, I never hold onto Bitcoin long enough for this to be an issue.  I usually spend it within a couple of weeks and replenish.

But even holding onto Bitcoin for 2-3 weeks can have serious negative consequences.

I look forward to the day when Bitcoin is not compared to the USD, but to gold or oil.";5;0;False;plazman30;e1j46gb;Not an AMG but thank you Bitcoin from the bottom of my heart!;8urtw7;https://i.redd.it/idltxupctw611.jpg
