"And you realize that was essentially one of my main points, right? Your reply only serves to validate my argument that people only congregate in this sub to validate each other's like minded, half-sided beliefs, and treat any opposing argument, or more accurately worded, **complete,** argument as propaganda to be taken with offense.

Now if you had a valid, well thought out counter-oppinion, I'd be more than happy to have a discussion- but what your response shows is that you are either unable to grasp the most simple economic concepts- or, more likely, are simply unwilling to. Your OP already shows your willingness to disregard a bounty of equally valid data and facts, and your reply to my comment shows your animosity towards anyone who presents a valid argument contrary to, not what you even necessarily believe, but what you want to believe.

Now, if you had a well thought out rebuttal to the points I presented, my response would not be to dismiss them blindly as they are not in line with my thinking, but to fully contemplate any information put forth by you, and engage in an intelligent conversation. If your points were valid and backed by facts and fully analyzed data, I'd accept them and be more the wiser for it. If I had information to continue our discussion, I'd present in in a respectful and thought out response- and in the end, perhaps we both may have learned from each other.

Sadly, I find simple refusal to accept clearly laid out information which is not in line with the collective mindset of the group to be the growing trend.

Irrelevant to my main points, I am a supporter of digital currencies, and of course that includes the original- my argument was against your single-sided presentation of data taken out of context and the idea that encouraging the hoarding of any currency with the intent of that leading to growth as being oxymoronic.

Present a beliefs not inline with mine and you will not be met with utter dismissal, but met with thankfulness for enlightening me on a side I had not considered. 

That is why I bother to post here, in the hopes of engaging in intelligent conversation- unfortunately, I'm met all too often by those skip would rather fling insults than discussion. There is always the minority who, unlike you, do provide me with food for thought- so alas, I remain.

*I would hope that to the casual lurker, and vast percentage of those who read but don't post, that your initial response to my comment would show that information like your OP should be taken only with a grain of salt and followed by individual research and their own conclusions.*

You see, you have only strengthened my argument and further invalidated your own. I do apologize if I've introduced doubt into your selective way of thinking which you use to help ease the suffering of the wealth you have lost as a result of falling for the mass delusion that it is more wise to hold through times of prosperity and depression alike, rather than to engage in buying low and selling high. But attempting to encourage others to participate in the same pyramid economics which caused your own losses will not help you to retake your losses. It will only lead to stunted adoption and subsequent growth.
