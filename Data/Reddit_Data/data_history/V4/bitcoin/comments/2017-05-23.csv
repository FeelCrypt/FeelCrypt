Although I concede that one of the reasons I like and use Bitcoin is because I want to off-ramp on the broken money system that most western countries have. I don't like it and I want out.

Just because joe your friendly neighborhood crack dealer sells you crack without any problems doesn't mean that crack isn't involved in violence, used to fund violence, or in any other way is associated with violence

The college kid snorting a line he bought through the Silk Road? Maybe he's not doing anything violently, but profits from that cocaine are funding drug cartels in Latin America. 

The war in drugs is a bit ridiculous and yes research done by organizations such as the WHO do strongly suggest that the stricter drug policies in the United States are not necessarily more effective than the less stringent policies in other countries. 

BUT just because the Silk Road appeared to be a nonviolent marketplace does not, by any means, necessarily mean that no violence was funded by, the result of, associated with, etc. drugs bought through the Silk Road. 

Drugs in our country do absolutely correlate with violence. And the Silk Road 1. Broke laws that, regardless of their effectiveness or popular support, are still laws and 2. Almost definitely contributed in some form to drug related violence simply through making it *easier* to fucking buy drugs.

"Ross William Ulbricht (born March 27, 1984) is a former darknet market operator, best known for being convicted of creating and running the Silk Road website until his arrest. He was known under the pseudonym""Dread Pirate Roberts"".

Ulbricht was convicted of money laundering,computer hacking, conspiracy to traffic fraudulent identity documents, and conspiracy to traffic narcotics in February 2015. He is currently serving a life sentencewithout the possibility of parole.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Ulbricht

Silk Road was an online black market and the first modern darknet market, best known as a platform for selling illegal drugs. As part of the dark web, it was operated as a Tor hidden service, such that online users were able to browse it anonymously and securely without potential traffic monitoring.

Ulbricht was indicted on charges of money laundering, computer hacking, conspiracy to traffic narcotics, and attempting to have six people killed. Prosecutors alleged that Ulbricht paid $730,000 to others to commit the murders, although none of the murders actually occurred. Ulbricht ultimately was not prosecuted for any of the alleged murder attempts.

In summary, police can lie to you and offer you illegal services or products as long as they dont force you to make use of them.

"The fact that he tried to have people murdered was factored into his sentencing though:

>>Ulbricht's directed violence here is and relates to the murders for hire which he is alleged to have commissioned and paid for. The Court must determine whether these allegations have been demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence and I find that there is ample and unambiguous evidence that Ulbricht commissioned five murders as part of his efforts to protect his criminal enterprise and that he paid for these murders. There is no evidence that he was role-playing.  The Court finds that the evidence is clear and unambiguous and it far exceeds the necessary preponderance findings, that Ulbricht believed he was paying for murders of those he wanted eliminated, and that he believed they had in fact been murdered.

>>So, the Court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the addition of the two-level enhancement is appropriate.

A) Ulbricht was neither charged nor convicted of this

B) It wasn't conclusive that the person who approved of these murders was in fact Ulbricht (source: http://thelibertarianrepublic.com/no-ross-ulbricht-didnt-murder/)

C) Even if he was that person, he did it because they were threatening to have him and his website users thrown in prison, probably for life. That's an act of aggression, and responding to it with violence is an act of defense.

> Ya, I was, and I stopped a long ass time ago, in large part because I took the time to find out where most of the shit that comes to the US actually comes from. I was also not facilitating millions of dollars in international trafficking and trade for them, and I did not try to have people killed for threatening to snitch me or my friends out, so let's not play some bullshit game where you pretend those things are even remotely comparable.

I didn't say they were comparable, and how much money you did or didn't make from your involvement in the drug trade is pretty irrelevant.

> The socio-economic causes of the problem are. Irrelevant. We have a good idea of some of the driving forces behind the rise of American street gangs, that doesn't mean you magically aren't accountable for your actions if you go out and join one, or sell drugs for them. or act as a middle man for shady shit that they do.

Selling drugs is not unethical. In this context, only acts of aggressive violence are. Being ""accountable for your actions"" doesn't mean you have no right to defend yourself if someone is threatening to destroy your life because you chose to do something a group of politicians (themselves criminals) have forbidden.

> Think about what you're saying here. Cartels exist because prohibition made them exist....and? Your point is? Now it's okay to financially support them, do business with them, make it easier for them to do business, just because we know why they exist? That's fucking insane. These are people who decapitate rivals' kids for sport and traffic underage prostitutes. The fact that you know what socio-economic woes allowed them to flourish doesn't mean you aren't accountable if you choose to support them.

Just because cartels exist does not mean Ulbricht was a party to their violence. This is why the airport analogy is relevant -- not because airlines are literally the same thing as Silk Road, but because any individual anonymously using a service may or may not be a violent criminal (or themselves connected to one) in the same way that a passenger aboard an airplane might be.

Your logic: Cartels are violent, therefor all drug dealers are violent, therefor Ulbricht is guilty and deserves life imprisonment.

Alternatively: Cartels are violent, therefor Ulbricht is not ethically entitled to defend himself if his life is threatened with permanent imprionment.

Just lol

Why do you keep claiming that it has something to do with the sentence? *You* are making the positive claim here: ""His sentence was so harsh because he tried to have people murdered"", is what you keep saying.

Okay then. Source? Where do you get the idea from that this attempted instigation of a murder (which never came before a court of law) influenced the severity of the sentence that was handed out? Who said that this was the case? Where did they say that?

If I was up for assault, and there was evidence that I was generally a shit who got into fights all the time and not the tree hugging pacifist who was 'just defending myself' that I was claiming to be, then maybe that evidence should factor into my sentence.  One gets community service and fine, the other gets time in a harder institution. The prosecution wouldn't have to *prove* I was being a shit to passers by and spitting on puppies, but they would maybe be able to assert that I wasn't a generally nice person through various means, even if the evidence against me wasn't 100%.

>that's not legal.

Please cite that evidence relevant to a case shouldn't be considered as part of the sentence (and yes, his DRP activities and *everything* he did on Silk Road are relevant to this trail) and doing so is somehow illegal.

"> Well... it can be entrapment, clearly! It all depends on the hows and whys of the situation. Ulbricht's case (according to what people have said in this thread, which is admittedly not any measure of truth of accuracy) may fall squarely into the definition if the investigators purposefully made him think his life was in danger whereas he would never have tried to hire a hitman if that hadn't been the case.

Thats... so wrong. All that they showed was that Ulbricht would have ordered a hit if he thought his life was in danger! That's not a crime you wouldn't commit otherwise. That's a crime you have decided to commit and it just happens that a police officer is the reason why.

I don't know about you, but if I felt my life was in danger, I wouldn't order a hit. I'd probably go to the police.

It's not a perfect analogy, but it's pretty silly to claim that Ross Ulbricht deserves to be in jail for life (twice) because some of the people who used his website are bad criminals.

Sorry, were you not financially supporting them when you huffed all those hard drugs into your system that you bragged about earlier? Or I guess those drugs were just given to you for free, and clearly you got them from friendly criminals who definitely didn't get them from cartels.

> Unlike you and your hero Ulbricht, who would gladly make money hand over fist for the drug cartels you pretend don't exist.

I know drug cartels exist. I never denied that. The violence of cartels, and others operating black markets, is an inherent economic problem caused by prohibition. Ulbricht profited from drug trade on his website, which is itself not violent. That there were some violent, cartel-connected criminals who used his website really has nothing to do with it, and definitely doesn't make Ulbricht ethically culpable. In fact, his website served as a relatively safe way to trade drugs, compared to buying from dealers in person. This is in contrast from how you brag about acquiring the drugs you use.

"> They don't do shit to prevent it, the TSA does that. This is like claiming ISPs work to prevent the Silk Road from operating.

Airlines do not offer as a service, highly anonymized stealth flights for drug traffickers to ship goods across borders. It's not that this just isn't a good analogy, it's just not even an analogy, and it's beyond stupid that you're still trying to push it.

>but it's pretty silly to claim that Ross Ulbricht deserves to be in jail for life (twice) because some of the people who used his website are bad criminals.

No, he deserves to be in jail for life because he tried to have 6 people murdered so he could continue facilitating tens of millions of dollars in business for really awful people for his own profit.

>It's especially ridiculous when you consider the fact that they are operating on a black market created by an illegitimate government which profits from prohibition and that prohibition itself is what attracts the violent criminals you're referencing to the drug trade.

So? It's entirely irrelevant. I know that poverty contributes to high crime rates but that doesn't make it okay for me to buy stolen shit from people just because I know being poor influenced their decision to steal some shit. Likewise, just because I know *why* violent criminals dominate the drug trade, doesn't by any means make it okay to do business with them.

>Sorry, were you not financially supporting them when you huffed all those hard drugs

Ya, I was, and I stopped a long ass time ago, in large part because I took the time to find out where most of the shit that comes to the US actually comes from. I was also not facilitating millions of dollars in international trafficking and trade for them, and I did not try to have people killed for threatening to snitch me or my friends out, so let's not play some bullshit game where you pretend those things are even remotely comparable.

>The violence of cartels, and others operating black markets, is an inherent economic problem caused by prohibition. 

The socio-economic causes of the problem are. Irrelevant. We have a good idea of some of the driving forces behind the rise of American street gangs, that doesn't mean you magically aren't accountable for your actions if you go out and join one, or sell drugs for them. or act as a middle man for shady shit that they do.

Think about what you're saying here. Cartels exist because prohibition made them exist....and? Your point is? Now it's okay to financially support them, do business with them, make it easier for them to do business, just because we know why they exist? That's fucking insane. These are people who decapitate rivals' kids for sport and traffic underage prostitutes. The fact that you know what socio-economic woes allowed them to flourish doesn't mean you aren't accountable if you choose to support them.

>Maybe consider for a moment that you're railing against a position that doesn't even really exist.

That is hilarious coming from someone who has, not once, replied to anything I've actually said. You have, in nearly every reply to me, grossly misrepresented what I've said, from claiming I support violence (I don't) to claiming I want people locked up because I don't approve of what substances they use (I could care less what you put in your own body).";1;1;False;;dhx6omy;Hi, my name is Ross Ulbricht;6cp2ql;https://i.redd.it/djb8i3hoh3zy.jpg

It's clear what the law says, and you're right. I can't argue with how the law treated him from the pure basis of that's what's written and that's how racketeering offenses have been handled since RICO was written.

However, maybe I should be clear that my gripe is more of a idealistic one - that someone who facilitated a non-violent marketplace where people dealt drugs got a heavier sentence than most murderers, rapists, and drug dealers. 

That's what's bullshit. Yeah - he broke the law, and the sentencing was handed down at its fullest extent. Gotcha. That still doesn't make me think it's any less bullshit. That this country is so scared that people might be able to get drugs non-violently and THAT deserves super harsh punishment while they leave alone the murder stuff just because it was a harder case to build.

is definitely wrong. 

> All that they showed was that Ulbricht would have ordered a hit if he thought his life was in danger! That's not a crime you wouldn't commit otherwise. That's a crime you have decided to commit and it just happens that a police officer is the reason why.

This is very dangerous in a society with checks and balances. The police can't ""just happen to be"" the cause for a crime. **If this scenario was true**, Ulbricht wouldn't have ordered the hit without the police intervening, so the police's intervention actually *caused* the crime! This is what's ""so wrong"" with entrapment. Judges sentence people for committing crimes, not for ""being the kind of people who would committ a crime if the police forced them to"". 

> Ulbricht was not an unwary innocent. He was a criminal, they just found a way to catch him.

This is dangerous too, because you're essentially saying that if you want to catch a guy who committed a crime, it's OK to make him commit *a different, worse crime* to put him in jail. That's... kind of insane, really.

" It's not anarchism. You open up any Poli Sci 101 textbook and in the introduction when they define the 'state' it's almost always going to include the definition of the state as an entity that has a monopoly on violence in some area. That's just how the world works and it's not really a secret.

 But in this case, Ross Ulbricht cannot realistically expect to benefit from the state's protection. Indeed, violence from the state is what even makes blackmailing him possible. So he must perform what is normally carried out by the state. Could I agree that death penalty is excessive for blackmail? Yes, though I understand that Ulbricht was more concerned about not being imprisoned for decades than whether the punishment fit the crime. Is Ross Ulbricht a bad person who should be removed from society because he exercised force against someone threatening his life? I don't believe so.

Consider a different case. What if you got into a line of work that exposes you to hazards, say you're a prostitute. Suppose then that you turn down a client but he tries to rape you. You could shoot him and be legally in the clear.

">This is a totally different scenario then the one we are dealing with in this thread, and it's pretty irrelevant to the discussion.

 How so? It's still a case of an individual dealing with police. Police make a demand, the choice remains the same: comply or resist. It get to the essentials. Why can't you resist? And you've actually answered although you don't seem to recognize it:

>you know that the police are legally authorized to use force against you and that resisting them forcefully is a very bad idea for you.

That's the threat of force, and ultimately, the threat of death if you are able to mount a highly effective resistance. And, indeed, even a traffic ticket is covered by this because if you absolutely refuse to sign it or provide ID, or if you never even comply with the police demand that you pull over, they will try to arrest you. If you resist arrest:

>the law is constructed to authorize the police to use force to arrest you, and to allow you to pursue release through the courts. The law is also constructed so that resisting arrest by force is in itself a violation of the law, and police are authorized to escalate the force used to arrest you based on your resistance.

I really don't see what you take issue with here. You seem to accept that police authority rests on their ability to exercise force. Even if the populace willingly empowers police to exercise force, that still means that compliance to police is compelled by force. At that point, it's just a matter of following the scenario to the end.

What do you expect this unreleased information to contain to support Ross' innocence?

Do you believe the uncaptured staff framed Ross?  Or that one of them is the real DPR?  What are you basing that on?

>>The government didn't care if ross only wrote one line of code or was the full master mind. They needed someone to go down so they could show the world that they will fuck up your world if you continue to try to fuck with their profitable drug scheme known as the American Drug War.

In your first sentence in this post you admitted that Ross created Silk Road.  Later you said you think he ""consulted and helped"" with the website.  So you don't believe his involvement was limited to one line of code, do you?

"Ok, but your definition can be misconstrued to include the exact examples I was stating are not entrapment.

I'm not saying your definition is wrong or not the technically/legally correct definition - I'm saying that your definition is the exact reason why people misunderstand what entrapment is - because the wording can be misconstrued easily.

Wikipedia:

>[It] is the conception and planning of an offence by an officer, and his procurement of its commission by one who would not have perpetrated it except for the trickery, persuasion or fraud of the officer.

So it has the requirement of false pretenses, persuasion, or lying.

From Sherman v. United States:

> ""To determine whether entrapment has been established,"" it said, ""a line must be drawn between the trap for the unwary innocent and the trap for the unwary criminal.""

"Yeah, I am generally one of the first to call bullshit on white guilt and black anger and the whole ""privilege"" guilt mongering (there are a lot of illogical inconsistencies with all of it). 
Racism, prejudice and bigotry are on a continuum, everyone has it as it is a basic cognitive trick of the human mind. White people (like me and presumably you) are going to have some blind spots and a coloring of events due to our subtle societal programming ranging from ""he looks different than me"" to ""oh, there is a person of color, let me go run and be tolerant to them,"" neither of which are helpful or real and lead (I feel) to more anger between groups of people. 

The vast majority of white people saw Eric G. and saw a black man committing a crime (no matter how minor) and refusing to submit to the police. Most of us think that if you have a law, you can't just go around selectively enforcing it, and we would be right.

The vast majority of black people see Eric G. and see a poor guy trying to make some money, being harassed by police using a law that is stupid. When he refuses to comply, he is just showing that he has had enough of the daily indignities their community faces each day by a system designed from keeping them down, and they would be right.

I know you like the DNM because you're an abrasive cunt and have no way to get drugs besides ordering them online, since nobody will deal with you in person and you probably look like a cop, but the fucking hard drug game is not all peaceful hippies just trading their wares and minding their own business.

Its not. Dreadd was hoodwinked. What happened was the ""victim"", Curtis Green, was flipped by fedders. The fuckboy who went to jail in this case, Mark Force IV, was posing as a cartel leader and had baited said shitbird into accepting a ki of coke (which the deetz on that are still sketch.) 

(If anyone is familiar with Sabu, he's the one who flipped on Jeremy Hammond for hacking stratfor. He's also the one who helped the fuckboys crack dreadds government.)  

Dreadd had ordered the hit on Curtis after Force, posing as a hitman, had set up a fake torture sting (which has been done before, see Hells Angels.) Dreadd had asked Force to do this, AFTER FORCE HAD TOLD HIM HE WAS AN ENFORCER. Force provided opportunity through his BS back story and the rest was history. 

To me, it would seem like Force did entrap Dreadd. To the courts & law, no. Dreadd was egotistical & certainly had motive, but Force couldnt prove shit, since his own involvement in stealing the BTC's makes him an accessory after the fact. He too should be faced with RICO charges and a new trial set for Dreadd so that the people can see just how fucked the fuckboys really are. 

Also, Dreadds trial was completely fucked and biased: the judge should have reecused themselves. ";4;0;False;;dhwxblk;Hi, my name is Ross Ulbricht;6cp2ql;https://i.redd.it/djb8i3hoh3zy.jpg

Well... it *can* be entrapment, clearly! It all depends on the hows and whys of the situation. Ulbricht's case (according to what people have said in this thread, which is admittedly not any measure of truth of accuracy) may fall squarely into the definition if the investigators purposefully made him think his life was in danger whereas *he would never have tried to hire a hitman if that hadn't been the case.*

As his persona 'The dread pirate roberts' when he ran the site it he had a whole philosphy of freedom kick he'd go on. Part of that was that anything intended to hurt others (guns, knives, hitmen, etc.) weren't allowed to be sold on the site. One of the common observations in the silk road community was that it was safer than buying drugs face to face, there wasn't really any opportunity for violence.

"He was making the drug scene safer. Take for example a heroin addict, if you are a heroin addict you usually have no more than a couple dealers that are willing to supply you with what you need to continue living (no exaggeration, withdraws can kill) you are usually at the mercy of those dealers. Which means that they have no accountability, and will likely not care if they sell some product that is laced with fent or carfent. On the other hand, with the silk road there was a rating system which would allow you to rate the quality of the drugs you recieved and this resulted in vendor accountability. Also, there was an abundance of dealers that you could choose from, all of them competing for your business, if one dealer allowed heroin laced with fent or carfent to get out then no one would ever buy from them, after all, why would you buy heroin from someone who was accused of lacing it when you can buy the same product at around the same price point from one of the other dealers. Also, the faceless transactions sharply curbed the amount of violence that results from the drug trade and most definitely took away millions of dollars from gangs that used to hold total monopolies over different areas. While yes, drugs are bad and no one should use them, there will always be people using them, and Ross created a way for people to purchase and use them in a much safer way and undoubtedly saved hundreds of thousands of lives.

My goal during this period of my life was simply to expand the frontier of human knowledge.

Now, my goals have shifted. I want to use economic theory as a means to abolish the use of coercion and agression amongst mankind. Just as slavery has been abolished most everywhere, I believe violence, coercion and all forms of force by one person over another can come to an end. The most widespread and systemic use of force is amongst institutions and governments, so this is my current point of effort. The best way to change a government is to change the minds of the governed, however. To that end, I am creating an economic simulation to give people a first-hand experience of what it would be like to live in a world without the systemic use of force.""

"Think the problem there is that respecting the law requires abiding by it and theres been plenty of positive changes made by people willfully refusing to abide by the law. 

The laws don't change all on their own. Its almost always because of people breaking them and not respecting them, that we have discussions of their merits and whether we as a society should continue keeping these laws. Its this very public refusal to obey that tends to swing opinions in public discourse where politicians lose support by continuing to advocate for those laws. 

That makes them much more likely to change positions or be replaced by people who are willing to introduce or vote on legislation repealing laws. 

The largest social movements in our history are examples of this and our very founding as a nation is based in this. A lot of people have a very valid point that even though drugs are a harmful thing for the individual, our criminal laws dealing with them makes the situation twice as bad by criminalizing behavior and creating a class of convicts because people exhibit drug seeking behavior that exists in every society and every time period in human history, that you're basically making people criminals for acting like humans. 

Just because someone points out that these laws are illogical isn't advocating drugs as a positive. Its advocating that we can reduce the burden on our society by not throwing people in prison just because they get high on particular substances. That simply won't happen by following the law. 

To tl;dr it. You won't change anything by respecting the law and not breaking it as an act of civil disobedience. Blindly respecting the law is antithetical to being an American.

"Thing is, there is such a thing as ""civil disobedience,"" the breaking of laws in order to make a point or further a moral goal. This is what the civil rights movement did, after all. There is even the notion that if a law is unjust, you are obliged to break it (and accept the consequences) in order to draw attention to it.

Of course, blindly.  The fun part of this is that, usually, people like you NEVER expect to be the criminal, until they are. And crime is a big concept.

> Clearly he was made an example of. Good. He can rot in there so that we have fewer people that want to take his place. The alternative is living in a country run by drug cartels. No thanks.

Oh but you ARE living in a country run by drug cartels (and where you live has little matters) what Silkroad, and Dark Markets in general, did is offering an alternative. Taking pushers away from the streets, clients outside dangerous encounters and exchanges, users away from potentially harmful and lethal cuts, basically making big holes in cartels domination. Of course DMs drugs don't come out from the tooth fairy butthole but the very big revenue of cartels, mobsters and criminals come from the distribution system, the same system that spawns ulterior criminality as a side dish.

> Before you down vote me to oblivion, I do believe we should legalize marijuana. I just don't believe that allowing people to willfully break the law for personal profit will build a viable society.

And of course it won't, it would be an oxymoron, but sometimes the harm comes from the law itself.
Your reasoning implies that without dark markets the world would be free of drugs. That's laughable.

"For the most part, but the website was so deeply engrained in the actual transaction (and profited from it) that he was considered party to the sale.

He was making the drug scene safer. Take for example a heroin addict, if you are a heroin addict you usually have no more than a couple dealers that are willing to supply you with what you need to continue living (no exaggeration, withdraws can kill) you are usually at the mercy of those dealers. Which means that they have no accountability, and will likely not care if they sell some product that is laced with fent or carfent. On the other hand, with the silk road there was a rating system which would allow you to rate the quality of the drugs you recieved and this resulted in vendor accountability. Also, there was an abundance of dealers that you could choose from, all of them competing for your business, if one dealer allowed heroin laced with fent or carfent to get out then no one would ever buy from them, after all, why would you buy heroin from someone who was accused of lacing it when you can buy the same product at around the same price point from one of the other dealers. Also, the faceless transactions sharply curbed the amount of violence that results from the drug trade and most definitely took away millions of dollars from gangs that used to hold total monopolies over different areas. While yes, drugs are bad and no one should use them, there will always be people using them, and Ross created a way for people to purchase and use them in a much safer way and undoubtedly saved hundreds of thousands of lives.;2;1;False;miki77miki;dhwxrox;Hi, my name is Ross Ulbricht;6cp2ql;https://i.redd.it/djb8i3hoh3zy.jpg

And yet, when this current trial, with seven charges was brought, all allegations of murder-for-hire were mysteriously dropped.

"It is kind of frightening that people are asserting things in this thread that they are 100% *sure* are true, which simply are not.

[I wrote a book about Silk Road](https://www.amazon.com/Silk-Road-Eileen-Ormsby-ebook/dp/B00HTWDEK0/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top), so I've been [following it pretty closely since almost its inception](https://allthingsvice.com).

There were no hitman services available on Silk Road. The entire site had a policy of not selling anything the purpose of which was to harm or defraud others

Ross Ulbricht was never charged for any murder-for-hire or attempted murder-for-hire. Five were dropped, and one charge is parked in Baltimore, but that will never see the light of day because the corruption of Force and Bridges, the two cops involved in the case, was so immense that everything they touched was tainted.

[There is evidence of tampering with the logs](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/new-evidence-suggests-rogue-government-agent-deleted-evidence-in-silk-road-case). There is another rogue agent, as yet unidentified, who did a very good job of covering his/her tracks.

"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/05/silk-road-doc-unintentionally-shows-whats-wrong-with-the-free-ross-crowd/

""That verdict, reached after three hours of deliberation, came not because Ulbricht wasn't allowed to make his case—a nonsensical trope still touted by his lawyer, family, and core supporters—but because his seized computer was literally full of Silk Road business records, chat logs with top SR admins, and a personal journal describing how he built the site.""

Now personally I think the article gives short shrift to the notion that the prosecutors referenced chat logs without accepting any possibility that there were more than one person using the ""Dread Pirate Roberts"" sign-in. Also, the documentary claims that the ""targets for assassination"" were members of the Silk Road forum that were fictional people created by the investigative team.  Considering that two unrelated and not coordinated efforts by rogue federal agents to steal bitcoins involved in the case, things are pretty fucking messy.

"While its totally fair to be skeptical, I know that silk road was well regarded amongst my peers for the safety it added.

I know street dealers who pride themselves on making a profit selling sketchy analogs as the real deal cause 'nobody knows the difference'. The peer review process mostly eliminated that.   

I have seen out of their mind drug dealers show up with half the product and demand twice the money because concepts like measurements are beyond their current state of mind. They feel like you are ripping them off and pull weapons and make threats. That doesn't happen through silk road. 

If you're not in the game, it may not make sense, and I can respect that. Seeking evidence is the appropriate avenue.

It's not some conspiracy, it's not so that people would talk about it on the internet, obviously. It was to convince the jury he was a bad man, obviously. It also really helps when major news networks show that stuff to hundreds of thousands of people. Not that he necessarily didn't do it, but the reason was not to convict him, but to ensure that the jury thought he was a bad man. I think they used that tactic because they used that tactic against my dad. My dad was a terrible man, but he wasn't a violent killer, but when he and his gang were arrested for selling weed, the prosecution intentionally made it appear as though my dad's gang was very dangerous and violent, to ensure conviction.

"While I don't have hard data to show you, it's quite obvious that the silk road rating system caused vendors to actually give buyers what they wanted. Which was high purity drugs and abundant information. When you bought a pill from the silk road the vendor told you the dosage and everything and would even recommend how much to take and how to take it. This was because if the vendors didn't give the customers a safe, and easy experience a customer would just go to another vendor that was selling the same product. On the other hand on the street, you would likely have a small amount of dealers that had 0 accountability and 0 reputation. I'm sure the silk road also helped lessen the amount of overdoses in the heroin community, because if a silk road vendor was found lacing their heroin with fent or carfent then it was game over for them and no one would ever buy from them again, since there was such an abundance of vendors. While on the streets you may be forced to buy from a certain dealer (that may have impure product) either of gang control or them just being the only dealer around.

"[Plural of Mongoose](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/3mkwbb/variety_jonesplural_of_mongoose_reveals_new/). Be prepared to do a [lot of reading](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/3mlwjf/the_ballad_of_plural_of_mongoose_aka_variety/)...

[This is the most recent article](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/sep/8/silk-road-suspect-defies-extradition-efforts-thail/) I can find about him.

He's also briefly mentioned in [this Playboy article (warning NSFW, maybe?)](http://www.playboy.com/articles/nick-bilton-silk-road-book-inteview). I'll paste the relevant text below, especially the question about who logged in as DPR after the site went down and Ross was in jail.

>>One of those people he trusted perhaps to a fault was his alleged mentor who went by the alias Variety Jones. And, yet, he was also someone who pushed back against Ross on a lot of these issues regarding consent. A man named Roger Thomas Clark was arrested in Thailand in Dec. 2015 for being Variety Jones. What’s interesting is there is still theories over whether there was more than one Dread Pirate Roberts that helmed the Silk Road or if Clark without certain is who is accused of being.

>First off, I don’t have a question in my mind that the people they arrested are the right people. I spent hundreds of hours with law enforcement, and interviewed numerous people who were on the site and worked on it. On top of that, I read 2.1 million words of chat logs, and Ross’s diary entries. So, yes, There is not an ounce of a question that these people are who we think they. One of the genius things Variety Jones did was suggesting to Ross that he take the name Dread Pirate Roberts, which was borrowed from the movie The Princess Bride. More specifically, it presented this concept—just like in the movie—that DPR is not one individual but several people who keep passing the moniker to a successor. For Ross, it was a way to erasing his past and to make the claim he gave the Silk Road to someone else after going from the name Admin to DPR. And that was the entire defense in Ross’s court case! That there were multiple DPR’s.

>There was a line the judge said during the sentencing of Ross. That “people are very complex.” The same thing was true with Variety Jones. He’d sit there on chat logs and say things like “We should have this person killed for stealing money” or whatever. And yet he was adamantly against heroin on the site. He told a story about how he was in jail in England, and there were these things called “hell days,” which was when people would get access to heroin and took as much as they could over the weekend, before the drugs tests began on weekdays. He was horrified about how sick this people would get from withdrawing during the week. He thought it was the most destructive drug in the world and wanted nothing to do with it. So it was fascinating how people who worked on the Silk Road and sold on it had all these different philosophies. The weed people didn’t want to be associated with the people who sold guns, and the gun people didn’t want to be linked to heroin, and the heroin guys didn’t like the fentanyl sellers. There were all these dynamics. And Variety Jones was an embodiment all these things. And without question he was the most important person on the Silk Road besides Ross.

>>What do you make of the argument that there must had been more than one DPR since someone logged in as DPR on the Silk Road message board, which stayed up after the site was brought down, weeks after Ross was arrested?

>It interested me, when I first started reporting this. But then when you see the stuff that they got on his computer and his writings, it’s impossible to make that claim. And if you go through the chat logs, it would take a team of hundreds of people several months to manipulate that many words. What my researcher and I did was. So for instance, you see in the chat DPR say , “okay I’m going away for the weekend.” And then literally 10 minutes later there is a picture of Ross with friends as they sat up for a camping trip. And then, come Monday, he would log on and say he met this beautiful girl on the camping trip. These things happen over and over. There is not a doubt in my mind, whatsoever, that Ross was Dread Pirate Roberts from the beginning to then end. There was a defense that when he was in the library that day when he was arrested, that the real DPR had hacked his computer and put all those chat logs on there and manipulated things. It is impossible that much information could have been planted on his PC in that short of time.

>In regards to the login on the Silk Road message board, from what I’ve gathered from my reporting is that the team that had been working for him were working on the Silk Road 2.0 and they took all the code from the first one and it turned out that the code allowed them to log in as DPR.

EDIT: This is linked further down, but [there is suspicion the chat logs were also manipulated and evidence was removed post-seizure](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/new-evidence-suggests-rogue-government-agent-deleted-evidence-in-silk-road-case).";12;1;False;Yorn2;dhwsnxf;Hi, my name is Ross Ulbricht;6cp2ql;https://i.redd.it/djb8i3hoh3zy.jpg

It's insane the amount of misinformation people just spew on this subject.  I always tell people for a while you could make a listing for anything. There was a big difference between something being listed and something being bought.  There was at no point a hitman with a sold listing or positive review.  They were all most likely scams and super expensive.  (60KUSD?) Guns were sold for a while but eventually you couldn't sell anything that could bring harm to someone.

Of course, it would be ridiculous to argue that there were not (our would not be) abuses even though there were rules against such things. Even if those rules were set in place to give some theoretical safety net to the operators. My point is that this guy is indeed being railroaded, he is a victim of government excess.

You can get just about anything you want on Craigslist buts it's still up. I don't think your argument is thought through. My point simply is that the man should not have been sentenced anything close to what he did and a lot of people who are far more informed that I think so as well.

You are stroking it pretty hard for Ulbricht in this comments section so I'm just going to point out that the evidence for the murders was presented at the trial where he was convicted.  While murder wasn't one of the charges, the evidence was covered during the trial and not disputed by the defense.  If I was Ross and I didn't do it, no way I would have let that slide by.  Your argument that he wasn't tried for murder only works on stupid and callous people.  The evidence shows very strongly that Ross did it and intended for cruel things to happen because of money.

Silk Road, no matter how good its existence was for a jumpstart of Bitcoin, was, for all senses and purposes a black market. Yes, you could buy a lot of things there but it was used mostly for drugs - either buying or selling them.

When you create a meme which just says ""Support this guy he was a saint who created this innocent marketplace and guvrnmt thrown him into jail"" you're creating a false narrative and making him a martyr.

You're not presenting the facts and ask people to support Ulbricht on the merits of facts, you're painting the narrative which would rile up the large number of people (""Oh, government locked down an innocent man, those bastards"")

For all good he's done he wasn't innocent. The debate about the legality of drugs is one for the another time but what he was doing was illegal. And he's not one of those poor kids who're getting locked in prison for years, for the possession and smoking of marijuana.

He was a middleman of one of the largest drug markets on the Internet and he profited from it. His motives weren't entirely altruistic - he wanted to profit from the illegal activity.

Now, was his sentence just? I don't think so.

"This is a lie.  It's repeated everywhere and it's not true.  An important thing to remember is anyone could create a listing on silk road for anything.  There is a vast difference from a listing existing and something being sold.  I can make a craigslist ad selling the international space station but doesn't mean I have it.  During some period in silk roads infancy there was a few weapons for sale on there.  I used to browse the listings and reviews quite often on everything on silk road.  The guns were all very over priced and there was never ever a vendor with more than 2 positive reviews.  In fact I would be willing to bet my life that less than 100 guns were sold on the site. But if id have to guess for a million dollars i'd say something like 17.  Never at any point did the site have a reviewed hitman.  I remember seeing a few listings ever for ""murder for hire"" and they were like 60k USD.  No one is going to send 60 thousand dollars of untrackable anonymous currency to an anonymous person.  If they did it seems 99% or more than likely it would be a scam.     During the last 2 years when it truly blew up you couldn't sell anything at all that was meant to harm someone.  Not even stolen identities.  I remember at one point ricin was for sale from a fairly popular vendor and his account was permanently banned.  

I don't think Russ Ulbricht was some hero or saint.  He was a genius for sure.  It's impossible to say how much of the stuff he said about wanting to help people was true.  Many people bought into it.  I was always skeptical it kinda seemed like marketing to me.  The dude made a drug empire online in 4 years that rivaled some of the biggest cartels on earth.  The net effect of him was certainly positive.  For the first time in earths history people had access to safe, peer reviewed, lab tested illegal drugs.
