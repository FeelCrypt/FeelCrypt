It's a fantasy land. 

I obviously didn't have my bike, but on day two of our stay the guy I the best tent, a local who volunteered to be the safety coordinator of the track corner at the entrance to the campsite, offered to let me borrow his old katana 600 to get around the island for the rest of our stay.

"I'm long on crypto. Not trading much to be honest. It's really not that expensive or complicated to setup a second residency.

I'll use Mexico as an example.. The costs to get a 1 year residency include like $30 for the initial visa application, the cost of a round trip flight from the US, and rent on a Mexican apartment ($300/month) so you have a mailing address during the application process. You have to stay in Mexico for one month while applying, another month to renew after 1 year, and 3 years after the renewal you can apply for permanent residency.. If you want citizenship, you have to live there for 18 months prior to applying and learn some basic conversational level Spanish. Not a huge deal. It'll take 5 years total but you're only required to actually be in the country for 20 months total (18 consecutively). You get a really great passport in the end for a VERY minimal financial investment.

"Yes. We live in US, were staying in Ireland (currency: EUR) for a couple weeks, and took the ferry to IoM (currency is GBP) in a spur of the moment decision to see the races. If you're not familiar with the IoM TT this may seem odd, but its a small island of a few thousand suddenly is swarmed by tens of thousands of fairly wealthy, partying, motorcycle enthusiasts and racers for two weeks. 

We showed up at the end of week 1, with backpacks, euros and debit cards, left most of our luggage in Ireland, and had reserved a campground on the northern part of the island (shout out to The Silly Moo!), ferrying into the southern tip (only point of entry). The plan was to ferry into town, buy a tent, and take a bus to the campground. 

Buses are cash only. My cards had only been working at ATMs for the whole trip for some reason, and at large businesses (car rental, hotels, etc) but not for small purchases (pubs, merchants, taxis). I realized this days earlier so I'd just been keeping plenty of Euros on me. But EUR don't work on the Isle. No problem, just go to an ATM! No Cash. Go to another ATM - out of service. Ok. Go to another ATM - out of service. Fuck. All banks are closed (Friday after 5pm), 80% of businesses are closed because locals either party with the bikers, or leave for the event. Only places open are pubs, and every pub's ATM is out of service. So we just started walking. The town is on a hill (coast of an island), and the coastal streets are full of drunken tourists so we walked uphill away from the water into the residential area. Finally found a tiny convenience store with an ATM at the very back that was working.

"Many reasons.

The more paranoid answer is that it is an insurance policy against future unknowns. When investing, do you diversify your assets? Why wouldn't you do the same with your living situation?

A practical reason is that establishing a secondary residence can change your tax position so that you aren't required to pay as much in taxes.. or any taxes in some situations. Do your crypto trading through an LLC in a tax haven then you potentially wouldn't have to pay capital gains tax.

The more pedestrian answer is that it makes international travel easier. It is very difficult to get a long term residency in (or even go to) some countries.

"Why do you think credit card processors are blocking bitcoin purchases with credit cards?  They're terrified of the LN making them obsolete, just like the WWW made AOL obsolete, Amazon made Sears catalog obsolete, and Netflix made Blockbuster obsolete.  In the near future, people will open credit lines with banks and/or investors directly over LN.  

This will happen because companies like yours, that do hundreds of millions a year through the card networks, are run by smart people who are going to be able to reduce those transaction fees to almost nothing and pass the savings to the bottom line and/or lower consumer prices to win more sales.  Business owners and shareholders will demand it.

Visa, Mastercard, Amex, Discover, etc. need to come up with some other value proposition, because being a middleman in the digital age is a death sentence.  One free suggestion for them would be to start LN nodes now and build out their cross connections as quickly as possible.  Sears could have crushed Amazon in the crib if they had the vision of fulfilling their catalog orders online, but they didn't get it and now they're struggling to stay in business.

No, they're avoiding fraud; they couldn't give a shit about LN.

> In the near future, people will open credit lines with banks and/or investors directly over LN.

Lol, no, they won't.

>This will happen because companies like yours, that do hundreds of millions a year through the card networks, are run by smart people who are going to be able to reduce those transaction fees to almost nothing and pass the savings to the bottom line and/or lower consumer prices to win more sales. 

No, Visa and other networks will simply lower their fees, they charge as much as they do now because they can, not because they have to.

> Visa, Mastercard, Amex, Discover, etc. need to come up with some other value proposition,

No, they don't, their value proposition is protecting consumers from fraud, which they do better than anything else and which Bitcoin/LN are not even competition.

"VisaNet processes 150M tx per day, which amounts to about 1700 tps on average with a 24,000 tps theoretical maximum.  

There are *currently* almost 2,000 LN nodes on Bitcoin Mainnet, in the project's infancy.  Each LN node is certainly capable of at least 1 tps, which means it could currently handle Visa's throughput right now with room to spare.  Each LN node can easily handle 12 tps, so LN can match VisaNet's theoretical maximum performance right now. We're talking about real world performance on a deployed network, not vaporware.

Each LN node can process hundreds of tps, so LN is already an order of magnitude better than Visa, and it hasn't even started to take off yet.  VisaNet is a dead man walking.
