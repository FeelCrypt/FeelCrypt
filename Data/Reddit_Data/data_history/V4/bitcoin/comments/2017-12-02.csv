"There are plenty of periods of times where deflation has occurred and has not cause recessions. My point about it being made up was more about ""deflation is more dangerous than inflation"". I do agree that rapid change in a currency is going to mess with a market, especially where you have sticky prices and fixed contracts (due to the prior expectations of a stable currency) but this is irrelevant to whether it's inflation or deflation. There are far more examples of runaway inflation causing issues than the other way around.

Any argument that can be thought of against deflation on the technical/nuts-and-bolts level can be applied to inflation equally (and often times is more applicable to inflation) just by flipping the question.";1;0;False;out_caste;dqo4kq0;It's official! 1 Bitcoin = $10,000 USD;7g9cd3;https://v.redd.it/e7io27rdgt001

 I got it at a 50% discount to the ticket price, I buy the dips and spend on up days. The bitcoin I spent is worth more now, but once it leaves my hand it isn’t mine anymore.  But that’s how bitcoin encourages saving over spending, the cash you hold is worth less every day where the bit coin is worth more. ;1;0;False;mixologyst;dqnttuj;I hope James is doing well;7gla05;https://i.redd.it/h4ngqma643101.jpg

Do you have or use bitcoin? Through Coinbase I got a shift card, it swipes anywhere they take credit cards. Whenever I swipe, they transfer the approximate amount of bitcoin (usually +10 to 15%) to the card. When the transaction settles, they credit the difference back to bitcoin in Coinbase. This works anywhere that accepts credit cards, not because San Francisco. ;1;0;False;mixologyst;dqnt2tu;I hope James is doing well;7gla05;https://i.redd.it/h4ngqma643101.jpg

No, it couldn’t. We’re at a time now that the actual “investment” the regular Joe’s are throwing down is big money for them.

"**Paradox of tolerance**

The paradox of tolerance, first described by Karl Popper in 1945, is a decision theory paradox. The paradox states that if a society is tolerant without limit, their ability to be tolerant will eventually be seized or destroyed by the intolerant. Popper came to the seemingly paradoxical conclusion that in order to maintain a tolerant society, the society must be intolerant of intolerance.

"The point I was making is that the stuff has no inherent value to fall back on. It is a bubble and unless people stop treating it as an investment and start using it as a currency (and I mean on a massively larger scale, like I can go to a drug store and pick up a box of Tylenol and pay with bitcoin), I’m very unconvinced it isn’t just a speculative bubble.

I mean obviously I could end up being very wrong. It could end up actually replacing or reinforcing standard currency and then go on to continue increasing in value.

"By swing trade?

Daytrading is pretty self explanatory and longterm investing as well. Swing trades are an intermediate.

Basically a swing trade is when you see a price swinging around a resistance point for a few days or weeks and buy it on the low swings, sell it on the high swings. Such as BTC has been doing swinging around the 10k landmark price.

For a while you could set your watch to $AMD falling to 2-3 bucks because Intel was taking over the world, everyone crying bankruptcy, then swinging back to $4 when people bothered to look at their finances. It was easy pickings for anyone who noticed the pattern.

A blow-off top is when a price rises too fast and abruptly pulls back — not necessarily because of bad news but just because impulsive or ""weak hand"" investors decided saw a scary steep line and decided to cash out. Like when these mainstream journo dorks were reporting 11k back to 9k as a ""catastrophic plummet! bubble has popped! oh no!. They can be prime swing trading targets.";4;0;False;lonely08;dqnf8nw;Eleven!;7gzr64;https://i.redd.it/07te6jshxe101.jpg

No more time to tell how
This is the season of what
Now is the time of returning
With thought jewels polished and gleaming
Now is the time past believing
The child has relinquished the reign
Now is the test of the boomerang
Tossed in the night of redeeming
Eight sided whispering hallelujah hatrack
Seven faced marble eye transitory dream doll
six proud walkers on jinglebell rainbow
Five men writing in fingers of gold
Four men tracking down the great white sperm whale
Three girls wait in a foreign dominion
Ride in the whale belly
Fade away in moonlight
Sink beneath the waters
to the coral sand below
Now is the time of returning";2;0;False;;dqnhueb;Eleven!;7gzr64;https://i.redd.it/07te6jshxe101.jpg

"It’s a gamble. I see this is a bubble that will eventually burst and never recover. The fact that this sub exists, and is in the state that it is, should tell you something. Would you trust these people with your money? I, for one, wouldn’t.

Or it could keep on keeping on and become the new world currency. But I highly doubt that. This seems like a fad more than anything, and when it inevitably crashes, I just can’t fathom it recovering. Too many people will be burned in such a way that they will not be able to recover. A lot of people “investing” in bitcoin are putting almost all of their money into it because they see others making insane amounts of money. Problem is, when it crashes hard, a lot of people will be left with absolutely nothing. At that point the hype train will be gone, and it will never return, because of the crash. That’s my theory at least. Everyone here will disagree with it though, because they’re not legitimate investors and they didn’t diversify worth shit, and this idea scares the living shit out of them.

Edit: Also, the stock market is likely going to take a fucking nosedive if the tax bill passes. It’s a complete repeat of the 1920’s leading into the Great Depression. If that happens, Bitcoin will fold.";35;9;False;BLMdidHarambe;dqnb3hl;Eleven!;7gzr64;https://i.redd.it/07te6jshxe101.jpg

When bitcoin grows by 20%, your capital grows by 20%. The same is true for litecoin. It doesn't matter which cryptocurrency you buy.

* trading even at larger volumes and longer wait times becomes unreliable or to costly it loses value.

For that reason I have not re-balanced out of cryptocurrency, but I have a pretty high paying day job anyway, if that were not the case it would be insane to continue holding the vast majority in crypto.

"Say's law says that the supply of a good creates equal demand for that good. That's not what I was saying at all. It is generally accepted in monetary economics that an increase in production (or an increase in returns from investments in capital) lead to a higher demand for currency. That is basic monetary economics; would you like me to show you on paper using an endowment economy model?

And it does matter what currency you use, buying a PS4 from the Swiss market using francs makes no sense if you're a US citizen. The cost (time, effort, and money) to convert your assets into francs is strictly higher than buying the PS4 on the US market, not to mention the costs of obtaining the PS4.

And it's a grave misconception to think that people are going to ""cash out"" just for the sake of profit. Bubbles burst when the market realizes there is no value in what they are investing in, *beyond any doubt.* The housing market crashed when CDOs became utterly worthless because it was *absolutely clear* that 80% of the mortgages in those CDOs were in default. Investors weren't cashing out because the prices were high, they were cashing out because it was 100% clear that their investments were worthless.

The future of bitcoin is extremely uncertain but there is promise. To say that it is beyond a doubt worth less than $11k is a weak argument at best. Hell, to say it's worth more than $11k is equally as weak. But I can assure you that the market won't crash just because people want to cash out for a quick buck.";2;1;False;M0T0RB04T;dqmtz7i;Don't invest recklessly;7gi55s;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7gi55s/dont_invest_recklessly/

"How are you going to wire money to the exchange in another country to buy Bitcoin if your bank won't let you? What if it is illegal to send money out of the country for the purpose of buying Bitcoin? How would you repatriate the funds from selling BTC?

I support some of the general idea of Bitcoin but I think that the speculative action going on now that is driven by the exchanges will ultimately be harmful and will collapse, probably sooner than later.

As the value of a Bitcoin increases the incentive to clone or fork it also increases. Each clone or fork decreases the value of Bitcoin. The original blockchain is indeed a limited good but it is not unique. The idea of an SHA-256 encrypted blockchain is not particular to any one token. The very same machines that mine (process transactions for) Bitcoin can be used to mine any other SHA-256 coin. By contrast gold is a truly unique relatively scarce element so **can** serve as money. I am not saying it should or should not. I am just saying that Bitcoin is not truly scarce in the sense that gold is. It is also possible that in the future an algorithmic weakness will be found in SHA-256 or that quantum computers, if they can be built, will be able to quickly decrypt it.

If there is a real commerce, as opposed to speculative, demand for a Bitcoin like financial instrument then the one with lowest cost and most efficiency of use will ultimately win out. Value stored in $10,000 Bitcoin is not worth much if it can't be spent by the majority of holders, i.e. exchanged for goods or services or sold for fiat, without driving down the value toward $100 or lower. There is no intrinsic value in a Bitcoin besides what is transactionally useful for and not much can currently can be purchased without currency conversion. There is no reason why market price can not crash in the future. If there is a demand for Bitcoin-like assets substitutes will arise until the marginal benefit of forking / cloning equals the marginal cost of doing so (almost zero for non-holders).

Ultimately money is about the power to allocate scarce resources in society. A global Bitcoin economy would arbitrarily assign a disproportionate amount of power to early adopters, disregarding real merit or skill, at the expense of everyone else. The broad swath of society won't accept this so it won't happen. What we consider money arises from a **broad** social consensus. People already complain about the 99% many of whom are self-made through their own work not just lottery winners. Society will not accept a new elite made of OG CypherPunks. So the left out people will make their own coins or nation sates will issue coins and make them legal tender. If enough people accept the new coins in exchange for goods and services then that will depreciate the real value purchasing power of BTC. 

The current dollar value of Bitcoin is a mirage due to lack of people spending it and speculative demand possibly primed or pumped by Tether funny money and the hype surrounding Ethereum and its myriad ICO offspring.

In the context of Crypto tokens such moves may be seen as normal and healthy. In the context of real world money, such as Bitcoin seems to aspire to, it is absurd and unworkable. Exchanges will be the downfall of Bitcoin. It is only a matter of time before bad actors or overleverage or sudden correlations (e.g. black swan) bring down an exchange. What is going on with Tether is, from appearances, pumping a speculative bubble by essentially printing money. Without a real audit of their accounts people are just taking them at their word. What if their USD balances are loans and because of some external reason the banks lending to them need to withdraw credit. Tether collapses and the air goes out of the crypto balloon. There is no legitimate reason why Tether should not be thoroughly and publicly audited. It seems unlikely the growth in Tethers this year is due to new real USD deposits due to their banking problems.

">meant a demand for savings

Then we're saying the same thing. Banks take savings and promise a return on those savings (R^1 ). Then they loan out whatever the government doesn't require them to hold in reserves. Investors take loans to invest in capital at an interest rate (R^2 ). In perfect competition among banks, R^1 = R^2 .

Investors will invest in capital and recieve a return of R^3 . If R^3 increases (higher production/ return on capital), the banks can loan out savings at a higher R^2 . Higher R^2 means higher R^1 . Higher R^1 makes people save more. Thus, demand for savings increases due to increases in capital returns. And like you said, a higher demand in savings means a higher demand for currency. In other words, higher productivity of capital creates higher demand for currency.

I see what you're saying, your counter arguments are sound. At first I thought you were just spouting out economic terms but you seem to have an adequate grasp on those topics.

The housing market crashed when CDOs became utterly worthless because it was absolutely clear that 80% of the mortgages in those CDOs were in default.

"> I have no idea why you’re bringing fractional reserve banking into this

I said ""in terms of creating ""fake"" wealth"" not in how it operates. People hate the concept because what happens is a bank gets $100 deposited by you, they loan out $90 of it and some of that $90 goes right back into the bank account of another user, so out of your $100 the bank might possibly have over $100 in deposits. People hate the concept because it's creating fake wealth that doesn't exist, if everyone withdrew their money from a bank at once they bank can't simply recall all their loans and 90% of that money in deposits would have to come from thin air if it's FDIC insured.

Bitcoin is much the same. If somehow every single bitcoin was magically transferred to your wallet (and everyone who currently had bitcoin didn't mind for whatever reason) would you now be the richest person in the world? Could you buy amazon with all this bitcoin? If everyone tried to use their bitcoin all at once, is there really enough ""wealth"" to buy ~$150billion worth of stuff? Bitcoin is fake wealth because if everyone actually used their bitcoin the price would crash. It's expensive because most bitcoins aren't circulated since people are holding.

> No one dumped 150 billion into bitcoin or 23 billion into bitcoin cash.

That's exactly the point, where did this wealth come from? I don't know the ratio but let's say it's 50% (probably lower than this but who knows). If only $75billion was dumped into bitcoin, why is it worth $150billion? Where did that ""$75"" billion come from? Is there a bitcoin bank that has in its reserves $75billion so that if everyone withdrew their bitcoin they'd at least get something back? If everyone all at once in the same second decided they wanted their ""cut"" the price would instantly drop to $0 and no one would get anything. The money put into bitcoin just went into other people's pockets. ""Bitcoin"" is literally worth nothing more than what people are willing to pay for it. Did bitcoin really create enough wealth to feed 50 million people for year? 

> This is how companies are valuations are arrived upon.

This is **wrong**. When a company goes public it does not suddenly release 100% of itself to the public, it'll release say 30%. If a company thinks it's worth $100million when it goes public it'll release a million shares at $30 each. That money then goes **to the company**. So now the company has $30million in cash it can use to buy equipment, inventory, hire people, etc... Furthermore using the above example:

Let's say everyone all at once would want their cut of Apple and no one wanted to buy a single share, you would not be left with $0, Apple would have to liquidate its holdings and assets and while you may lose money since its stock is worth more than its assets you would not be holding an empty bag. When you buy a stock you're not buying a piece of paper you're buying a piece of an income producing company. If it has a positive PE ratio little by little you're getting value back from it even if no one ever buys a share from you. With bitcoin the value only comes if someone is willing to buy your bitcoin from you.

> Bitcoin, like anything, has value because the market assigns it value.

Apple has 375.3 billion in assets, and generates nearly $50billion in profits per year of which it keeps $45billion (aka: increasing assets) and gives shareholders $5billion in direct payment. Apple's currently priced at a PE ratio of 18.62 meaning that if nothing changes it'd take apple 18.62 years to ""pay for itself"".

""The Market"" isn't *assigning* apple it's value, the market is trying to *find* what its value is. When speculating (Gold, Bitcoin) the market assigns a value, and that's much different than a stock.";3;1;False;awoeoc;dqnski3;Don't invest recklessly;7gi55s;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7gi55s/dont_invest_recklessly/

"Technology drives all prices down, some faster than others. Bad (inflationary) monetary policy drives all prices up, some faster than others. If the prices of computer parts were to stop falling then we would already be experiencing hyper inflation - the tech sector is currently one of the only parts of the economy that can stay ahead of inflation.

Goods that are most directly affected by credit and government subsidies - housing, healthcare, higher ed, automobiles, food, etc - are where we see prices rising the most because new money (credit) flows there first.

During the 19th century (in the US) all prices fell on average and it was one of the greatest times of improvement in the living standards of the average person in all of human history. Most bank notes during this period were backed by gold or silver.

In a sound money economy, all prices would almost always be falling at a fairly predictable rate, with very few exceptions.

"That at least doesn't reflect my approach to how I'd personally handle deflation if BTC became a dominant currency. I won't stop needing or wanting things even if my money increases in value, especially if BTC became the most widely used currency I'd have to use it. It's great to know that if I'm saving up for something it won't lose value faster than I can save up due to inflation and increasing prices. There's no joy in keeping a number in an account, even if that number can buy more after some time.

If BTC is widely adopted to the point where almost everyone have some I don't think the value of BTC would increase rapidly. It increases rapidly right now as more and more people get a piece of it, but at some point I think that will slow down a lot.

Right now of course I won't use my BTC because it's increasing in value at an insane rate, and because I have an alternative that will be accepted as payment anywhere whereas BTC is not at that point, yet! But the day I can get paid for work in BTC, pay taxes with BTC, buy my food with BTC and buy my PS4 and TV's with BTC, then I will most definitely not hoard it all.

I cannot see your pessimism on the basis of how I believe people would handle their needs and wants. I can't believe most people would starve and stop wanting luxuries for a virtual number, I think money will continue moving to obtain those things.

"I've seen other schools of thought point out that you could say that of electronics: why buy an smartphone today if I can get one better next year for the same price. Or why buy a computer today if I can buy it next year for much less price.

And yet electronics is a thriving industry. People seem to want their iPhone 8 NOW instead of their iPhone 6 plus even though it doesn't provide much more value.

Same thing seems to happen with the automobile industry. Cars are a liability and yet everyone in this sub apparently wants an expensive lambo instead of a cheaper but functionally-solid car.

"lol this is what Tesco do (look into who owns Tesco..)

you expect a bag of frozen veg to be 1kg in the UK. It used to be. Tesco will reduce it to 900g or 850g, and charge £1 the same as other 1kg bags at other supermarkets. Or even more sometimes.

Supermarkets constantly list price per kilo in different formats. Like price per 10g or 100g, so in a hurry you can't easily do the maths to compare.

Tesco also sell inferior red grapes that are more green then red, for £4 a kilo. This inferior product in Aldi is their 'value' range and is £1.25 or £1.35 at time of writing with actual red grapes being £1.59 or £1.69.

Sometimes Tesco sell the proper product for £2 (£4 k/g) but I suppose when it suits them. If they only have inferior products they obviously feel no shame about just keeping the price the same hoping Joe bloggs doesn't have the time or energy to moan.

"**Land reclamation in Singapore**

The reclamation of land from surrounding waters is used in Singapore to expand the city-state’s limited area of usable, natural land. Land reclamation is the process of creating new land by building outwards into local bodies of water. There are several different methods of reclaiming land, but the most basic approach involves the importation and dumping of large amounts of heavy rock and/orcement into the desired waters, creating a firm base onto which clay and dirt are added until the anticipated new land height is reached. Draining submerged wetlands or similar biomes in order to recover land also classifies as land reclamation.

"those are valid points. But there are many things that are intertwined  and thats just one example. For example in smartphones there is the ""trend factor"", also the features. You might want to upgrade because of a certain feature set that just came out. Because your friends have it, because of marketing. 
Some non essential stuff doesnt become obsolete after a year, so there is absolutely no incentive to  buy that now instead of in 1 year. Obviously it its a multifaceted situation

And sure you could apply the same thing to everything and offset some of the problems that deflation could bring. 

But there is another huge problem that could be caused by deflation. Why would a bank want to risk money by loaning it to you when they can just stash it and have  asteady 2-3% increase in value just by doing nothing ? 

You want 1 million for a business and you put a collateral of 1 million? well that collateral will be worth less in USD over time because of deflation so no incentive for a bank to loan you 1:1. At the least it will have to raise the interest rates for it to be more appealing for them. 

That Hedge Fund that invested 25 billions USD in a lot of companies to try and beat inflation by making ROI wouldn't need to take that risk unless it was something really good. I mean 0 risk 3% yearly is not bad at all. Lots of millionairs would like something like that. That's a lot of money out of the markets and out of different companies. 

It's definitely an extremely large and complex problem. Not something you will have a solution by a couple comments on Reddit. 

But I trust most of the professionals I read that agree taht the best or least bad monetary policy is a controlled inflation between 1-3% for the reasons I tried explaining. 

Obviously there are much more knowledgeable people than me that could answer much better.

"Bitcoin is speculative and inflexible today. It may not remain that way in the future. With a wide enough adoption I think the value of it will drastically increase before it slows down and stabilizes to a somewhat predictable rate of deflation. It probably won't grow much in value every year once it's widely used.

I think bitcoin can become a means to an end eventually, I'd imagine markets are capable adjusting price of a commodity according to supply and demand just as before. Just because a price number gets adjusted down every year instead of up, doesn't mean the actual value of it decreases, especially if the value of the currency increases. Today it's just the opposite, price numbers increase as the supply of money is inflated, it's not necessarily worth more.

But yeah, today and probably for some time, bitcoin will increase so rapidly in value it will be used as an investment vehicle, it's unrealistic to believe this rate of growth will be sustained in the long term though. It's still in it's early years, this is something untested and different from the currencies we're used to.

"Bitcoin is backed by the energy needed to mine it. In general the energy cost to mine a Bitcoin is about the market rate. Obviously during insane bull runs it becomes profitable to mine for a while; but the value of a Bitcoin is the amount of energy we divert to it instead of other uses.

However ultimately, like all commodities, including Gold, Silver, and Dollars; it is backed by our collective belief in their value.

"> Aggregate demand has to be increased before firms start increasing their supply, which will put more people into jobs and more money in their pockets, which in turn increases aggregate demand even more.

I’m sorry, but you’re wrong. If you increase demand artificially, by the means of printing money, you’re going to create mass inflation and debt, which will cause a downturn in the growth of economy later.

That's an interesting perspective: that the economy (i.e. the myriad decisions made by individuals each second as to how resources, wealth, and risk are allocated between them) should have to adapt to the properties of a currency rather than the other way around. I view currencies as a means to an end and not an investment vehicle by themselves. All forex trading is inherently speculative, and Bitcoin as a currency falls into that same category. Currencies are a tool and the more flexibility we have over how that tool helps serve us, the better. Bitcoin is too inflexible, in my opinion, to ever be useful as an everyday currency in a world of many dynamic economies.;2;1;False;BLOKDAK;dqnwnjj;This Bitcoin chart is insane!

I had a  boss who is famous nationwide of how cheap he is. His daughter did an internship with us and she was telling us stories that I wouldn't believe. He would chew gum and then save it  and put it in the freezer. If he wanted more gum he would take out it, sprinkle some sugar on it and go to town.

Why?  Just so he didn't have to spend more money than he absolutely had to.

He's obviously the most extreme example I personally know obviously it was a pain in the ass working for him. But I learned to never underestimate the lengths people will go to not spend money or to make more money if needed

Most of the people are still riding the train and very few think about unloading btc now for Fiat. Or to spend for stuff.

I mean, financially if you're sure btc is going up and you can afford to pay, even getting in debt is a good choice for your day to day and pay it off slowly with btc. As it goes up you spend less of it. So that 0.01 btc you spent toda would be 0.005 if you paid it in credit. But that carries a risk of course.

I think the jury is still out on whether or not it saved the economy. The US government debt hasn't been paid off, and the inflation from QE caused things like medical bills, education, housing to skyrocket, and citizens have to borrow a ton of hyper-inflated money to finance these as wages stagnated. I think this may eventually cause another crash akin to the 2009 mortgage crisis, and the hyper-inflation cycle will repeat.

You appear to have a 'them and us' view, with 'them' being the horrid capitalist 'market'.

The sellers of houses are the owners of the houses - your mums, dads, uncles, aunts, neighbours. They're not some Evil Corporation or Secret Cabal. Every time a house is sold the owners look for the best price they can get, and in years with lots of willing buyers the price they can get is higher.

"You lend at zero or negative interest because you lose less money doing so than you would by holding onto it in the form of an inflationary currency. This is a good thing because, in general and overall debt is a good thing.

Being able to borrow is a leveling factor. You talk about just being able to hold onto your currency until you have enough to buy what you need, but there are two assumptions in that: one, that you have any currency to spare (it's not always possible to save, especially because a deflationary economy puts downward pressure on wages) and two, that the chance to take advantage of an opportunity that requires capital is not time-dependent.

Let's say you have a great idea for a business or an invention that nobody else has yet, but you don't have enough capital to get that going. By the time you save enough cash to get it started, the market has moved on either because another company has figured out your angle or the time just isn't right anymore.

Put it another way, let's say you have a small business already and one of your customers wants you to provide an additional product or service which would be within your scope and capabilities, but would take a large amount of capital to get off the ground. A new manufacturing facility, for instance. You are best suited in the market to provide this customer's needs all but for your lack of capital. Because you don't have the cash to build that new facility, they go elsewhere and are provided poorer service at probably a higher price.

The only advantage your competitor had over you was capital. Everybody loses when capital is a complete barrier to entry.

"* Incentive to spend is less because holding currency increases buying power in the future relative to the present.

* Debt is far more expensive.  If you get a loan and produce a return, that goes to paying interest and taking a profit.  In the case of inflation, interest rates are low because sitting on money results in losing some to inflation.  Better to get even 0.1% return if you can.  In the case of deflation, money appreciates while doing nothing, so the interest must be greater than deflation.  Furthermore, paying back the loan is done in the future were the effects of deflation have kicked in, so getting the same unit of currency requires more value in exchange.

It's very hard to reason about this, though, because *so many* aspects of the economy change in such a scenario.

"Lending can exist without inflation, but nobody is used to the idea that zero or even negative interest can be profitable with a currency that steadily becomes more valuable. With bitcoin you can't print money, but you can divide it. It's kinda the same thing in reverse. 21 million doesn't sound like much, but you can in theory divide infinitely. The smallest amount today is 1 satoshi, but it's technically possible to divide further should there ever be a need for it. So according to math you can create infinite units by division, just like you could ""print"" infinite dollars by increasing the total number.

I think the main difference is that with increasing the amount of money, some authority needs to control the limit. With division the value of the currency regulates itself and an authority cannot abuse it. A unit steadily increases in value for various reasons and can be further divided to pay for less valuable things.";1;1;False;Dwerg1;dqndqoe;This Bitcoin chart is insane!

"A lot of Keynesian-styled ""experts"" in here acting as if Keynes' view on inflation is the accepted view of everyone who studies economics.  This dismissive attitude backed by almost no critical thinking is the hallmark of the Keynesians.  According to the Austrian definition, this graph literally shows inflation.  Keynesians believed stagflation was impossible, and were tossed off of their high horse in the 70's when despite ""stimulating aggregate demand"" with inflation and redistribution schemes-economic growth stagnated.  Neo-classical economists were brought in by most western governments as a result and until recently Keynesians have only been the authority in our lovely university circle-jerks, where Marx also enjoys a higher status than economists skeptical about inflationary monetary policy.  

Austrian theory states that when a government seeks to plan and manage the economy, they will use price controls-subsidies-regulations-tariffs etc. to hide the effects of inflating the money supply.  They measure inflation using the CPI basket of goods which includes highly subsidized basics, and fails to account for a great variety of goods and services that do increase in cost.  Rent is an obvious example.  University education another.  Austrian theory uses rational thinking where these Keynesians will try to respond by showing a chart or graph, which will inevitable fail to address the holes in the methodology of inflation calculation.

All of this aside, military Keynesianism is the real reason that the effects of inflationary monetary policy have been softened.  The cost of this economic theory is global military presence and constant war.

"So the point, mentioned below is that the 18,800 is inflation adjusted income.  Presumably the $956 is not inflation adjusted. and it would be roughly: $10,802.80.  So if we're looking at home prices, which is the example you use, then housing has in fact gotten much, much more expensive.   I mean, anyone whose been alive long enough knows that is true since the 80s.

Now, yes real median income has grown a lot since the 1940s (again 1 year after the great depression).  But compare this chart:
https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MEHOINUSA672N

with this one:
https://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2016/08/daily-chart-20

The first shows that we're about 10% higher in wages since 1980 (and roughly equal to 1999).  Now in the second one, look at the US line (green).  Housing prices are about 3x as expensive.  

Edit: Also notice, that the income / house prices in 1940 is around %~55 vs the %~38 in 2000.  
That said, this isn't apples and oranges but I just wanted to point out the example your using proves the opposite of what you mean.  However, other things (like food) I believe have gotten quite a bit cheaper and obviously houses come with nicer amenities these days (though I am living in one from 1938).

"You've just outlined exactly why the blockchain revolution is so important. In a centralized banking system, if the U.S is experiencing deflation the bank (a Private business) can decide to do whatever it wants with your deposits. You don't have competing economies (or currencies, as currencies are usually backed by a nations economy). If the U.S economy is experiencing deflation and you live their, too bad, here is your USD, good luck!.( physical economies are geographically specific ). You have to deal with whatever the central bank wants to do. In the blockchain economy, Bitcoin is not going to be the only store of wealth. You're are going to see competing stores of wealth(coins) valued (by the community) for whatever decentralize solution they offer and backed by the demand for that solution. Just basic Supply/Demand. Ultimately the transacting parties determine its nominal value. A real free market. Not this mutation that they call capitalism. 

We are very fortunate to have a viable alternative to the current paradigm, were, because of fractional reserve banking, the banks leverage your deposits (to pay for wars, pollute your waters, poison your food, addict you to drugs) for the sake of profit. We almost annihilated ourselves. Or rather the plutocrats almost annihilated us. WE are about to experience the biggest transfer of wealth in history. Once the migration to blockchain is complete whoever invest wisely will profit immensely. It's time for someone else to be in charge of the wealth. We don't need to take back the means of production. We need to take back the means of financing production.

"The story of inflation in the US is a 100 year story. Most people have probably heard their parents talk about 25¢ or at least sub $1 gasoline prices (I personally remember sub 88¢), 5¢ drinks, 10¢ magazines and comics. This is the process by which all nations and empires die - and it only accelerates.

You know of the gas shortages in the 70's right? Those evil ""OPEC created"" shortages that just happened to coincide with economic stagflation after the dollar was completely decoupled from gold in 71... In reality what happened was not a result of OPEC wanting to make less money because they hate our freedoms, it was that the US stopped honoring the gold backing, and printed a metric shit ton of money. Then the US government tried to insist that oil be traded for the same nominal amount it had been before they basically doubled the amount of money in circulation. They were trying to cheat the OPEC nations into accepting half the value for the same amount of product by pretending the nominal price was all that mattered. 

Studying history through an accurate economic lens is quite enlightening - I highly recommend any books by Tom Woods (Meltdown is a great book on the financial crisis) and his podcast.

But in any case, the price of cars is out of control too, advancements should be available at the same or lower prices just like we see in tech - they use less metal, moulded interior parts are cheaper, machines for producing them are faster and more energy efficient, they require less labor, all different models tend to share parts, engine management is cheaper. But more and more cars are financed. $100k Teslas are being subsidized. And cars are required to have lots of heavy and expensive ""features."" Ask your parents or grand parents how much they paid for their first cars.

One particularly amazing thing is that gas prices have recently been cheaper than they have ever been before if we adjust for inflation thanks to fracking. And when oil/gas prices are cheap the cost of all products comes down because they are cheaper to ship, plastics are cheaper to make, things are cheaper to bottle, etc. A change in cost in one industry pretty much always sends ripples through the rest of the economy. Tech advancements have massive downward pressure on prices, and yet they keep rising anyway because our monetary system is terribly corrupt.

"For the games thing - it is already the world we live in. Games get less expensive as time goes on, so do consoles, so does every other piece of technology. People still buy new computers because they want them even though they know they will cost far less in 2 years. At the same time, not everyone buys games on day 1 at $60. I rarely pay more than $10 for a game; I know if I wait a year or two, Steam or whomever else will put it on super sale. People already live in your scary non consumptionist world.

I really disagree that killing non essential jobs is a definite bad thing; it is more of a grey area. I put it in the same category of unnecessary market inefficiency like car dealerships. Should everyone use spoons instead of shovels? Catering to market inefficiency is only a good thing if its your job that's on the line. For everyone else its bad. On that same note, inflation is bad for savers, good for people with debt. Inflation punishes people who spend less and rewards people that over spend. A deflationary currency is a bad thing for some people, but not all. 

Also, even though bitcoin is slightly deflationary, people have and still use it to transact. This whole ""bitcoin will ruin the world because people will just hold bitcoin rather than spend them"" is a falsehood imo. If no one ever spent their bitcoin, we'd still have never achieved a level of price discovery. The first person who bought two pizzas with 10k bitcoin probably knew it was deflationary, but they still bought the pizzas. People used to buy drugs off of silk road with bitcoin even though the drugs were unneeded and the currency they used was deflationary.

This whole deflationary currencies would ruin the economy is an often repeated scenario, but really, its only bad for people with debt (which I will concede is most people). Only a fool would take out debt in a deflationary currency. Its also foolish to leave a bunch of money in a savings account and have inflation eat away at it. 
Maybe there is room for both.

"The flaw in your reasoning is that dividing the wealth of currency holders doesn't decrease the value of their wealth, so neither does it increase the amount available for lending.

I think one of the main things that is missed by the Bitcoin community at large is that anybody who holds wealth owes their success to the society which made their wealth possible. It could not have been achieved in the absence of that society. This implies an obligation on the part of the wealth-holder which goes largely unacknowledged.

"**Edward Bernays**

Edward Louis James Bernays (; German: [bɛɐ̯ˈnaɪs]; November 22, 1891 − March 9, 1995) was an Austrian-American pioneer in the field of public relations and propaganda, referred to in his obituary as ""the father of public relations"". Bernays was named one of the 100 most influential Americans of the 20th century by Life magazine. He was the subject of a full length biography by Larry Tye called The Father of Spin (1999) and later an award-winning 2002 documentary for the BBC by Adam Curtis called The Century of the Self.

His best-known campaigns include a 1929 effort to promote female smoking by branding cigarettes as feminist ""Torches of Freedom"" and his work for the United Fruit Company connected with the overthrow of the Guatemalan government in 1954.

"Just for clarification:

The cryptocurrencies ""market cap"" is really M1. It only talks of the monetary supply (And it inflates it, since a relevant % of those coins are already lost forever)

So yeah, that graph above is indeed M1, but so is the cryptocurrencies graphs, we don't have economical models yet to describe cryptocurrencies any better than just multiplying the total money of coins with the price right now.

"Damn, this made me think about how loans could work with bitcoins. If you can loan bitcoins (if used as commonly as fiat is today) then interest would really screw you over as you owe an increasing value, but will probably get paid less salary as the value of bitcoins steadily increases.

Obviously that's a problem and I just read about the arguments about why deflation is bad, it mentioned that with deflation the interest could reach zero causing nobody to lend out money. But I find that to be a limited view, if money increases in value then it is profitable to lend out money with zero interest. A loan might even have negative interest for anyone to take it and still be profitable, if the money increases in value slightly faster than the negative interest eats away at the loan. It would basically be the same as it is today, except they can't recklessly print you some fresh money for a loan, just divide up the existing money and increase the value of the currency. It would also seem as a positive experience as you'd see your loan ""shrinking"" by itself, although this is an illusion because while the number goes down each number is worth more.

I think the reason why people find loans and deflation to be such a ""problem"" has an explanation in psychology and what we're already used to. Today there's inflation and positive interest to make loans profitable, that's what we're used to seeing and negative interest sounds like a dream and with an inflating currency it really is a dream. The psychology part  I think has to do with simply feeling positive towards a growing number, without considering that the larger number doesn't necessarily buy more things than the lower number in the past.

tl;dr When people say loans can't work with bitcoins, they think of how loans currently work with an inflating currency. They don't consider that there's no mathematical obstacle preventing zero or negative interest, while maintaining profitability of lending money.";1;0;False;Dwerg1;dqncxr9;This Bitcoin chart is insane!

BTC is a valuable technology and holds promise for the future, and yet the pressures that cause someone to choose certain investments over others remain the same. Right now, there is a lot of incentive to buy and hold BTC since its value is increasing so quickly, whereas there is incentive to invest USD into other assets since its value depreciates with time. Care to explain where we disagree exactly?;2;1;False;warrior-prince;dqmwwfo;This Bitcoin chart is insane! Oh, wait… that’s actually a chart of US dollar money printing.;7guh08;https://i.redd.it/a582ruk7ta101.jpg
"The amount available for lending doesn't need to increase. The value of the currency increases, meaning if you lend out 1BTC with zero interest, then by the time the loan is paid back you still have 1BTC but 1BTC is worth more, so you've profited. Say a house in the future might be worth 0.01BTC, if you have 1BTC you can lend out to 100 people so they can buy a house. If there's zero interest and BTC slowly increases in value you'll still end up with 1BTC when loans are paid back, but by that time a house could be worth 0.005BTC. Then you can lend out to 200 people so they can buy a house, and on and on like that it goes.

The numbers are simplified to prove my point, I'm not suggesting the deflation would be like that in the future. Point is that you don't need to increase the amount because the same amount can be traded for more goods in the future. The advantage is that to lend out money you need to actually have the money, unlike today when they can in theory make up a number which could ruin the economy if done recklessly.

So, with bitcoin you wouldn't make more bitcoins, just divide it into smaller units as the value of it increases, to maintain its utility in buying cheap products. Everything gradually becomes worth a lower amount of bitcoins as the value of bitcoins increases. It's just the opposite of how it is today where everything becomes worth a higher amount of fiat as the value of fiat decreases.

It's math, there isn't a flaw in my reasoning. It's just how economy could work with a currency where a fixed amount increases in value. If you think about it long enough, I think you'll see what I mean.";1;1;False;Dwerg1;dqnf4gx;This Bitcoin chart is insane!

Years ago, I told a few family members about bitcoin. My kids and I had just started using it but it was really the potential is had in developing countries that I was most fascinated with. Anyway, my brother laughed at me and was still mocking me just as recently as $4000ish. My dad basically didn't believe anything I said about it and completely blew me off. When it was around $600, I sent them all the referral link from Coinbase for the $10 incentive. My dad said nothing, my brother said he didn't think it was a good thing to spend his money on (he's really big into investing), and my mom promptly purchased a decent amount. I can safely say she is very happy with me today. She has never spent a penny of it and probably wouldn't even know how. She asked me if she should cash in when it hit $10,000. But, what do you say to that? I told she had to make that call.;1;0;False;deathsmiled;dqoc88t;Today my mom call it Bitcorn. Yesterday it was CoinBit.

"Yeah, Stocks were primarily physical back then. All of the Investment banks actually had security vaults with all of their stock certificates.  At the end of the trading day they would send the physicals by armored car to each other to settle the trades.  It's the main reason most trades are in the 100 share size, and options are 100 share contracts.  It used to actually cost extra to buy an ""odd lot"" or non-100 number of shares.  

Look up ""settlement cycle"" to get a feel for it.
