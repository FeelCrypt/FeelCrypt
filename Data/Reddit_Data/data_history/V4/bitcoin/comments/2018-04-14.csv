"Cryptocurrencies, more than any other asset, are associated with current news. Most the people here (and more-so in /r/CryptoCurrency) have some vested interest in cryptos.

When price dies, they get a bit worried really. They get caught up in HODL and circlejerk optimism in attempts to cause the price to increase, again.

Bad news doesn't really end up circulating as much because of its effect on the price. If it does inevitably circulate, people try to cook up something positive with it.

Cryptocurrency communities in general end up being pretty shit for this reason. People have too much vested interest to engage in more honest discussions. Bitcoin in early days before all the price hype and the traders had a great community. Some altcoins had great communities before popularity hit and traders took over the active discussion.

To some extent, a no-trade-discussion subreddit would be useful, and all trade shit and memes are posted to another sub. Nano achieved this with success, separating trading discussion and focused discussion.";2;0;False;BustyJerky;dxctzbh;Bitcoin Doesn't Give a Fuck.;8c6o3w;https://gfycat.com/LinedTallBobcat

"BTC closed yesterday above $7,500, confirming a double bottom bullish breakout and the falling wedge reversal (bullish pattern). The breakout was also backed by strong volumes.

Momentum studies show a 5-day moving average (MA) and 10-day MA trending north, indicating bullish setup. The relative strength index (RSI) has moved above 50.00 (into the bullish territory).

So, the tide has turned in favor of the bulls, at least for the short-term.

View

A short-term bullish reversal has been confirmed.

BTC looks set to test resistance lined up at $8,500 (double bottom breakout target) and could extend gains to $8,620 (50-day moving average).

A Minor pullback to $7,600 cannot be ruled out as BTC looks overbought as per the RSI on the hourly chart and 4-hour chart.

Only a daily close below $7,000 would abort the bullish view.";-1;1;False;Cryptocurrencyforum;dxct3bt;Bitcoin Doesn't Give a Fuck.;8c6o3w;https://gfycat.com/LinedTallBobcat

">That risk exists no matter what your view of taxes are, meaning it's false to say that this ""depends entirely on one's view of taxes.""

You're talking about risk as being impractical. But Bitcoin is easy to use with a high level of anonymity (somewhat effortlessly if someone understands how it works). Plus Bitcoin and taxes are completely separable things and using Bitcoin without consideration of taxes makes it rather convenient/practical.

Someone's view of taxes (downside) and their view of benefit (upside) will determine the risk/reward decision they are willing to take. If a person believes in his/her government and the benefit of taxes, the'll pay the the taxes and there is no risk to consider. If they don't believe in gov't/taxes, then they might be willing to take more risk and not pay them. Still, we're talking about fractions of risk because it's so small. And in the very small chance that someone did get caught for making a few bucks, the fees would be insignificant. So it absolutely does depend on that persons view of taxes. 

Also there is another consideration. People view bitcoin as a currency. When people travel abroad, often they exchange for other currencies (EUR, USD, CAD, AUD, etc) to buy items in that local country. Nobody thinks ""if one currency rises in value relative to the other currency, then jeeze I will probably owe taxes!"" they just see it as a way to buy things. Same with Bitcoin in many people's eyes. It's another currency use to buy things. 

So yes, it totally depends on ones view of taxes and money in general. And it's practical to use it in various ways or else people would not use it.";2;0;False;Undisclosured;dxbtr3a;Hodl vs spedn;8bh2yc;https://i.redd.it/oh7hu2ks7ar01.jpg

">Do you not find it strange that there's a financial disincentive to ""use crypto the way it was created to be used""?

Not particularly. People are using it in a way that it falls into that category.

>You can't expect to just tell people to act against their own interest for the good of crypto, people don't work like that. That is not a sustainable model.

I'm not telling anyone to do anything, I am pointing out that it is not being used as a median for buying and selling goods as it was originally intended, and is instead being treated like a stock, and thus why I am not against it being under the capital gains tax for the time being. I don't care what you do with your crypto.

>This is what people wanted when they wanted a fixed supply currency store of value, something that would indefinitely increase in value and so would always be more profitable to hoard than to spend.

>There is something fundamentally wrong with the way it was created to be used if the way it was created to be used is less profitable than hoarding it.

I doubt the second part. If you had invested in some good coins late last year then you’d have a lot more btc now since they increased at much higher rates. And with the way the market was last year you really could’ve traded for almost literally any coin and still made huge profits. I 8x my initial btc holdings by playing around with “shit coins” last year and it feels pretty good. ;1;0;False;bagel-master;dxcney1;Altcoins waiting to see what Bitcoin will do;8bz18j;https://imgur.com/TxODJgX

For sure. I love Ethos. I own both. I think with how shitty coinbase is, Ethos will do extremely well but I think Blockport will do just as well because it's more centralized in Europe.

Because dominance means almost nothing in this space when you can create currencies in a matter of minutes and artificially bump their **market** value. If people actually thought they were valuable then their price would be decoupled from BTC after few months but none of the altcoins seem to be able to achieve this. ETH is the one that is the closest of doing this at times because it has proven to have some other use cases (ICO's mostly), which does not mean it is a good or bad altcoin, it's just an observation.;1;0;False;joeknowswhoiam;dxchz5i;Altcoins waiting to see what Bitcoin will do;8bz18j;https://imgur.com/TxODJgX
"I'm not sure why you just listed a bunch of problems about the coin you are defending,  but that you for making my point.  

Firstly,  I already said that btc is OG and paved the way for the rest of us.  Kudos. We will will take it from here. 

Second,  btc power consumption is a net negative,  and people are actively pursuing less hungry options.  Saying that btc could power a country is misleading.  What you should have said is "" it would take an entire country to power btc"". Btc doesn't produce power for anyone,  it takes it.  So stop that. 

On to the numbers. Saying it has a 5.7b revenue stream is great.  But then following it up with a 3b operating cost readily takes the wind out of the sails.  Nobody is battling an eye at a product with a 40% profit margin.  

So ill go ahead and sum up the current pros  for you since you failed. 

- btc is currently the best fiat on ramp to other crypto. 
- btc is currently a reasonable store of value. Willing to say great store of value for those of you who can hold a year or more. 
- btc is known by many,  and understood by few.  This is a pro because as more people begin to understand it,  more people will see that there is any alt out there for every one off btc intended uses.  All of which do it better. 

And in case you were wondering,  bch is garbage too. I'm not a bch troll. Bch is literally bitcoin, but slightly faster and cheaper.  With a quarter of the name recognition.  ";2;0;False;pm_me_ur_cryptoz;dxbslx3;Altcoins waiting to see what Bitcoin will do;8bz18j;https://imgur.com/TxODJgX

Not quite, more like Ethos. But yes, Blockport is sort of like the simplified version with a handful of options.

BTC is and always will be the OG of Crypto and will go down in the history books. Do not underestimate it.

Some stats to demonstrate the sheer magnitude of energy behind securing the Bitcoin blockchain.

* Bitcoin's current estimated annual electricity consumption = 60,510 GWh 
* Annualized global mining revenues = $5,794,734,162 USD
* Annualized estimated global mining costs= $3,025,589,467 USD
* Number of U.S. households that could be powered by Bitcoin = 5,602,943
* Bitcoin's electricity consumption as a percentage of the world's electricity consumption = 0.27%
