Keep in mind that the traditional rules of finance may not apply to bitcoin.  It's an entirely new asset class.  And institutions have not even gotten involved in it yet.  It's certainly a gamble but a good one in my view.  For me, it would be more painful to watch bitcoin fail than to lose my investment.  If you're of that mindset, you're in good shape.  If you're in it for a quick buck, you could get badly burned, no doubt.;1;0;False;affirmed_78;dnhkbfw;My parents' perception of me;723cnt;https://i.redd.it/8pz1r49enrnz.jpg

I won't disagree, but the point is Bitcoin will never replace fiat, because once banks/governments feel threatened by Bitcoin they will either make it illegal to use Bitcoin, or create their own blockchain which will be easier to adopt for the masses, as it will just be somewhat seamlessly integrated into the current digital money system.;1;1;False;jhanley7781;dnhc2ne;My parents' perception of me;723cnt;https://i.redd.it/8pz1r49enrnz.jpg

"Apple can remotely install updates to your phone without any user interaction and this cannot be disabled without jailbreaking.

Who knows what malicious features a new version of iOS/android/whatever may have, the ability to replace that OS or components of it is a security bonus in that sense. Yes in general a rooted device is less secure than one that isn't, however if you are rooting to remove a malicious feature, then obviously it's more secure.

I don't know if many people complain about Apple's sandboxing, indeed android has similar sandboxing, I think the complaint is the difficulty in sideloading apps that aren't approved by Apple. iOS and Bitcoin have definitely not had a good relationship. A few years ago Apple removed all the Bitcoin wallets from the app store. What if that were to happen again. There would be no way to use an spv Bitcoin wallet on iOS without jailbreaking.

"No, itâs guaranteed funds. Guaranteed funds means that the recipient bank releases that much immediately while processing the transaction on the back end. 

EDIT: Itâs the electronic equivalent to a bank draft or cashierâs cheque. The bank from which the money is being withdrawn immediately removes that exact amount from the account which itâs being drawn from, say $100. When the bank at which the account itâs being deposited into sees that itâs guaranteed funds, they immediately released $100 into the account itâs being deposited into while they take care of the back end work involved in retrieving the $100 from the other bank. The guaranteed funds part of it comes from the fact that they bank account from which itâs being withdrawn has had that $100 âremovedâ already, unlike with a regular cheque where itâs not removed until the cheque is processed on the other end. If you have $150 in your account, you can write 2 cheques for $100 for 2 different people and they can both deposit them. Their banks wonât release the funds to them until theyâve checked with the cheque issuing bank to make sure the money is actually there. One cheque will clear, the second wonât. I canât send an e-transfer for money that isnât in my account, as such when the recipient gets it, their online banking system treats it as guaranteed funds and releases it immediately to them.

"It's a bullshit feedback loop is what it is. Samsung puts out a phone with a goddamn eight core super CPU and a gillion mibs of ROON (technical terms), and so Facebook adds a bunch of ""functionality"" to its app.

Now the app is 47MB so you need at least 3G but preferrably LTE to download it, so the phone needs an LTE radio.

And hell, now since you've got LTE you might as well watch 4K videos on your fucking 6-inch phone screen.

Oh no, the 4K display is really chewing the battery so now we need a 4300mAh battery...

...which then catches on fire and everyone laughs and laughs, but you just bring out an even fancier phone with a non-explodely battery less than year later.

Careful, there are a lot of late arrivals from iFone lover realms in to the crypto realms today. You'd think your point would sink in with apple-folks but to no avail. Its like Fry in Futurama "" idc shut up and take my money"". No brainer hands down btc purchases with each iFone ReReRelease instead of a grand + each new retweak. 4 phone releases from now when btc is at about 0.0025btc for same 1000$ as todays iFoneX, everyone who didnt buy more will regret it. Your point of jail breaking your mobile is why Apple and Sony are such d-bags with unlocking, you realize how much better the end user can improve on the technologies capabilities and capacity for improvement, i.e. The unlockers may be able to come up with something better on the creators design, then Apple/Sony shit their corporate shareholder pants, and sue sue sue cease and desist away.

Venezuela's cash becomes a little more worthless every day.
It's a problem at the core of people's lives in Venezuela. Inflation forces them to cough up more and more bills for staples like food and medicine, which are in short supply for many, creating a humanitarian crisis.
On Friday, $1 equaled 10,389 bolivars. Earlier this week, on Monday, it was worth 8,820 bolivars. At the start of this year, $1 equaled 3,164 bolivars, according to the unofficial exchange rate calculated by dolartoday.com, which millions of Venezuelans use.

What's worse: Private banks let Venezuelans take out only 30,000 bolivars ($2.88) from an ATM at at time. Government-run banks: 10,000 bolivars (96 cents).
The currency's plunge over the years is jaw dropping.

I live in Texas. I had some BTC at Bitfinex on loan for margin trading. I need some of that as cash soon, so I sent BTC to my Coinbase account and sold it because I have a verified US bank account there and they charge no fees to withdraw fiat money.

"I can issue a sell command and liquidate all of it in an instant at the current market price.  The funds will probably sit ""locked and pending"" for a day or two while the bank transfer goes through, but the sale price is still locked regardless. 

This is only on values up to $10k with my current account settings. I imagine if you're trying to liquidate $400k you might have to plan ahead a little more carefully. It's certainly possible but you probably need to contact someone at the exchange and bank to help you facilitate it.
