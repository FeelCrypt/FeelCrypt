"Agree with /u/cumulus_nimbus below.

It's already a process trying to keep this place clear of endless lambo memes. 

Bitcoin is not it's price. It's a cool thing to watch and some indicator of adoption. 

Implementing this as a subreddit style option would only push the ""Buy Bitcoin to get rich"" mentality IMO. 

It would be more appropriate on /r/Bitcoinmarkets where trading is the focus. 

The price is fun, but it's not why many of us are here.

">Which is more addicting? Movies or video games?

I have a friend that is a huge movie buff. All he does is watch movies and talk about them. He even went to school to get into the movie industry. Which is more addicting will be purely up to the person. I see where you're coming from though, gaming gives a feed back loop that can be quite addictive.

>Which do people mostly spend more money on?  I have yet to see a case where someone spends thousands on movies, but video games that is a \(semi\) common occurrence.

People spend more money on video games than movies. That being said, if you've got the money, and it's a hobby you enjoy, why does the money matter? Spending money on things you enjoy isn't inherently bad.

>There are hobbies that help you grow as a human and hobbies that don’t. If you can honestly say you think that sitting in your dark basement drinking Mountain Dew staring at your WOW game for hours on end is a more wholesome hobby than like 90&#37; of the other options out there then I don’t know what to say.

So let's clarify a couple of things, I don't drink soda, and I don't play WOW either.

There are many different types of genres of video games, [WOW is a very small subset of that \(MMORPGs\).](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_game_genres) I generally don't play MMO's because they are a time sink, anyone who plays them will admit this. I prefer visual novels and JRPG's that tell a good story. Things like Persona, Final Fantasy, Ace Attorney, The Tales of series, etc. Though I still do enjoy the occasional Mario game. The games I play are more like books mixed with interactive problem solving. Playing these types of games from a young age led me to my career path. Even now as an adult, I love a good story mixed with great visuals/audio/gameplay. Games are a great way to relax after a long day to get away into another world and lose yourself for a couple of hours \(just like most hobbies\).

This isn't to say that those who choose to invest time in WOW are some how lesser though. While I can't speak about my personal experience with WOW, I can say that other games with online capabilities have certainly helped me make friends and overcome some really bad social anxiety. I can't stand behind those that spend their entire waking lives playing WOW, because I believe that is unhealthy. I think most gamers will agree with you on this.

However, your comment boiling gaming down to a neckbeard playing WOW in their basement, while eating Doritos, is ignorant. I highly recommend finding a video game you enjoy and playing it for a bit, if for nothing more than educating yourself on what gaming can be.

>When it’s to the point of whining about how bitcoin mining has affected your gaming experience because GPUs are overpriced that’s where I personally think gaming has crossed from casual to unhealthy

There's a middle ground between casual and unhealthy. That's where most gamers on reddit fall. It's certainly not black and white. People complain about the price of anything going up, that's a natural human tendency. Complaining about a piece of a equipment that is required for your favorite hobby because of the price went up is not an indicator of someone having unhealthy habits.

I mourned him as much as I mourned fred Rogers. They happened at totally different times in my life, I was a child when he died and a young adult when robin Williams did, but both affected me pretty strongly. When robin Williams died I think something actually changed in my ethos. I was doing a lot of acid at the time, so maybe that helped, but I started trying to be more like him in that respect, trying to keep the childhood wonder I still had left, culltivating more, and sharing it with the people I care about. ;8;0;False;Gh0st1y;dzuvat8;We are just waiting for the good times now;8nbmdp;https://i.redd.it/6nvi3w7wr1111.jpg

dude what color? It's all white inside the circle. Color is no parameter. OP said half are out, so I guess, it's all white words only. Also, there are 5 inclinations in total.

Supposing that the seed can be found, what would be next step in using the https://iancoleman.io/bip39/ tool? . The passphrase can probably be left empty, this would be the removed step. But then we still struggle with the Derivation path. I believe we will need to use the BIP141 tab. Any suggestion about the path to use, each choice providing a full set of 3...type addresses. I don’t believe the default is enough, will need to guess it to locate the 37XTV...address an its corresponding private key;1;2;False;CryptoSatus;dzvr2vo;1 BTC is hidden in this puzzle.
