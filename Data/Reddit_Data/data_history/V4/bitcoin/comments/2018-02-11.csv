">So, the only point that I am making is that bitcoin is traceable.

Practically all forms of money laundering are traceable in one way or the other. My point was that bitcoin might provide an avenue that's even harder than tracking a bank account. Since it's separate from the real world, the CIA wouldn't know where to start if they had no strong leads (bank accounts are opened in people's/organization's names, but a bitcoin account doesn't need to be). Payments in pure bitcoin most probably can't be as easily traced. And if it becomes more widely accepted then the problem would only get worse.

You haven't done much arguing over its traceability, just reiterated that it's traceable (without addressing how payments made in bitcoin can be traced or how the CIA can trace a person if they don't know where to start or how, even, a person that channels laundered money directly to bitcoin can be caught).

And that's just the THEROY. What about in practice. How the fuck do you get 100k cash into several hundred different bitcoin accounts? Well, dummy, you would literally have to fucking make the account , and PHYSICALLY, THROUGH THE MAIL, mail people cash, which they pay bitcoin for.

"Greece: the entire point is that the people don’t have control over their money. Bitcoin cannot be withheld from someone who owns it, you understand that right? The fact that there is a finite amount and it is decentralized means it can’t disappear. 

1. I’ll make it simple, with one letter all of your monetary assets that are not held in cash by a person physically, can be frozen by the government. So no it’s not fundamentally misguided. 

2. The government acts in its long term interest not the people’s.  The USD could absolutely experience hyper-inflation, due to a few events happening at the same time. Let’s hope the US doesn’t experience a bank run and have significant portion of our debt not be reissued, and a large scale war. 

3. Bitcoin can be anonymous, it also can be traced, depending on how you use it. With the ability to exchange it for other cryptocurrencies and the advent of the LN it certainly can be anonymous. As for fiat cash, it’s only anonymous when you have it in physical form outside of the system. The nature of the design of a centralized monetary system like the US, or any other major country, that physical currency will be put back into the system and be tracked. And then is under the control of the government again, that’s what I’m worried about.

You understand that the debt crisis in Greece happened because the country *didn't* have control over its currency. That can literally never happen in the US so long as the primary currency is the USD. Ironically if Greece 2015 scares you then you should be very afraid of bitcoin. 

Edit: 
Also to respond to your other points since you're saying people aren't. 

1. What exactly is it that you think we don't have control over? This is such a broad and fundamentally misguided statement that I have a hard time even responding to it. 

2. It's in the long term interest of the US government, and any government, to have a stable and predictable currency valuation with minor and consistent inflation. The value of currency is a function of many things, but to the extent that the fed influences it it is stabilizing.

">Do you think it's magic? You throw a stack of 100k dollars at a computer screen that has bitcoin written on it and it's magically legal? YOU HAVE TO REPORT THE REVENUE TO THE IRS AND BE TAXED TO MAKE IT LEGAL.

I see you're angry, but this is a strawman.

>You would have to set up a legal buisness with a bitcoin wallet. Then take several hundreds of transactions on YOUR ledger, from several hundred different accounts to make it look like you were running a legit buisness. And that's just the THEROY. What about in practice. How the fuck do you get 100k cash into several hundred different bitcoin accounts? Well, dummy, you would literally have to fucking make the account , and PHYSICALLY, THROUGH THE MAIL, mail people cash, which they pay bitcoin for.

Nope. There's no need for all of that. Laundered cash can be exchanged, gradually over time for bitcoin **directly**. There's no need to go through the financial system, and be tracked in any way. The fact that you can access this money anywhere and anytime also adds to the appeal.

Two: if you have an offshore account, you can use it to buy the bitcoins from the foreign country with your laundered money before spending it in your home country. Less need to tie it to fake businesses, charities and the like. And as I said before, as bitcoin becomes more widely accepted (if it does), this will grow in appeal.

Three (this isn't exactly money laundering but more of fraud) is how credit cards can be used. I'll quote someone.

>When someone would buy Bitcoins with a credit card, they could wait until the coins appear in their wallet, and then claim that their credit card was stolen used by someone else to purchase Bitcoins without their intent. They could get away with their chargeback claims, as it would be impossible for the seller to prove that they sold the coins legitimately to the person. Moreover, the seller wouldn't be able to get their Bitcons back due to ""no chargebacks"" rules.

But this might not apply in the US since I hear credit card companies have been banning payments made for bitcoin. Regardless, there are many other countries that haven't done so.

Well that's sounds strange, doesn't it? Deliberately *not* explaining stuff because someone *doesn't* know. 

I do know of the dark web, VPNs (I use one) and government spying (at least in America, not my country though, I think our government's too stupid [I just realized that this might come off as cocky, but really, they are]). I'd say making assumptions is kind of unfair, don't you think?

>You don't know shit. And you stupid smug remarks about how I am some how explaining shit wrong compounds frustration.

No no no, you aren't explaining stuff wrong. You just aren't explaining at all.

>You don't even know how to LEGALLY launder money.

Um, last time I checked (which is right now) money laundering was illegal. A federal crime in the USA, I believe. Maybe I missed your meaning?

>You think you are so gad damn smart, cause some dumb fuck said bit coin is anonomyous.

I don't think I'm smart. If I recall correctly, from the beginning, I was asking *you*, the more bitcoin-savvy person, questions. And forgive me for not trusting a random person on the internet who is not a money-launderer or financial crimes prosecutor, over numerous sources.

Er they do, normally it is properties though and the legal requirements have this lovely loophole. Unlike cryptocurrencies where the hole is actually a ocean cliff. In many ways people could just be complaining about the cliff being a wider drop than the hole. You cannot say they are wrong, it is wider. But then again the hole is much deeper. Money laundering is so prevalent it can span multiple industries and methods. It does not mean that cryptocurrencies shouldn't tighten the standards to at least be as difficult to use to launder money as others.

"While I commend you on appearing to have a very 'glass-half-full' way of looking at things, and you are quite correct that in theory, the terms 'illegal activity' and 'darknet activity' do cover a very wide gamut of activities, from those that would probably warrant a life sentence, to those that barely even get you fine.

However with the often quoted statistics dealing with Bitcoins connection to the darknet, the reality is quite different. When the term 'darknet activity' is used in relation to discussions about money,  it is specifically referring to the so called 'darknet markets' as these are basically the only monetised darknet activity there is. They are an ever-changing assortment of eBay and Amazon-like clones hawking drugs, stolen or counterfeit credit cards and currency, weapons, and sometimes even worse (though thankfully very rarely now). 

While there is nothing stopping somebody from trying to buy something completely innocent on a darknet market, say like a jigsaw puzzle, I can pretty much guarantee there would never be one available to buy. Because from what I understand, it's quite a complicated and expensive process to be allowed to sell things on a darknet market, and then you are only reaching customers who are there looking at purchasing drugs/illicit stuff anyway, so it would just be totally uneconomic to try and sell anything else through the medium.

>what is wrong with buying legal products/services on the darknet anyways?

Sorry my explanation turned out to be more long winded than I originally intended, but to summarise by answering your question above, there simply are no legal products and services to buy on the darknet.

>It’s totally fine for 40% Of Bitcoin transactions to be happening on the darknet really. Hell, I would be totally happy with a future where all transaction happen on a “darknet”, or be totally anonymous.

Also, I can assure you, you wouldn't be happy in a future where all transactions took place on a darknet where everything is anonymous, or at least based on todays format. You see, because of the anonymity and unregulated environment, it's incredibly common for parties in transactions to just pack up and disappear with all the bitcoins mid way through a transaction. Attempts to get around this by using an escrow service have also failed because the escrow provider would just pack up and disappear with everybody bitcoins too.

"**Financial crisis of 2007–2008**

The financial crisis of 2007–2008, also known as the global financial crisis and the 2008 financial crisis, is considered by many economists to have been the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s.

It began in 2007 with a crisis in the subprime mortgage market in the US, and developed into a full-blown international banking crisis with the collapse of the investment bank Lehman Brothers on September 15, 2008. Excessive risk-taking by banks such as Lehman Brothers helped to magnify the financial impact globally. Massive bail-outs of financial institutions and other palliative monetary and fiscal policies were employed to prevent a possible collapse of the world financial system.

"Some have, but overwhelmingly the majority of darknet drug deals are still made with good ol' bitcoin, and I don't think that's going to change any time soon. The alternative more privacy orientated cryptos are let down by a heavily fractured market with so many different options, which are usually more difficult or confusing to obtain, and then because they lack wide spread adoption, at so the end of day the most straight forward way to get their profit from the alt coin back into Fiat usually means going through BTC anyway.

But most importantly, I think most darknet users just really aren't too concerned about BTC's privacy vulnerabilities yet, partially because of the last point I mentioned above (that essentially all roads still lead to BTC at some point) but also because I don't believe there have been many, if any at all, cases where a drug dealer has had his identity compromised leading to his arrest purely from discovering and analysing his transactions and gleaning information from the block chain. There are cases where it has definitely been a factor, but there has always been sufficient suspicion on the suspect to have an investigation already well underway.";1;0;False;DrColossus22;du2e3kl;Nobody blames a currency when criminals launder money, but if they used BitCoin suddenly it’s a BitCoin problem;7wlmog;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7wlmog/nobody_blames_a_currency_when_criminals_launder/
You mean monero you still in most respects have to exchange BTC for monero. BTC still by far is the largest currency on the darknet markets monero is being more widely accepted but whats heavily driving monero price is BTC because there is no real formal exchange at least in the U.S. for direct USD -> Monero. People claim this privacy with monero but they have to buy BTC for monero so the clear existence of an exchange being available publicly is still available. People love to talk about monero and its privacy but the current mechnasisms to obtain it makes it somewhat less private than the direct exchange of the crypto currency for a fiat currency. ;1;2;False;OnlyInEye;du25pa4;Nobody blames a currency when criminals launder money, but if they used BitCoin suddenly it’s a BitCoin problem;7wlmog;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7wlmog/nobody_blames_a_currency_when_criminals_launder/

Most BTC is still used for Virtual game items and drugs that has always been the center driver for the reason BTC price rose. Then you add speculative investors that increased volatility. The value has to be driven by some item exchange that has relative value in another currency. Value in currency is usually based upon the basket of goods you can buy with it. Most of those goods are game items and drugs its not some secret. You can hardly buy anything with BTC and the few you can they instantly sell the BTC with some type of fee associated with it which is instantly converted to cash that then goes to vendor.

Came here to say this. In particular, didn't pursue a career in video games because it was universally rejected as stupid and childish when I was younger.

It's especially true when there's a generational divide in the adoption. It's a cliche (but cliches often spell the truth) that ""if you like it but your parents don't, the media/society will usually paint it evil/dangerous/bad""

From what I read, it was already true in Ancient times (Egypt, Athens, Roman Empire, etc.); kids would get scolded by their mentors and parents for liking things that weren't to the taste of the mainstream. 

If I were bold, I would surmise that there is a link between this and globalization: being exposed to new stuff usually attracts the young (""let's change the world with these new ideas""), and frightens the old (""let's protect and conserve our hard-earned culture and assets"").";1;0;False;ikkei;du2tio6;Nobody blames a currency when criminals launder money, but if they used BitCoin suddenly it’s a BitCoin problem;7wlmog;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7wlmog/nobody_blames_a_currency_when_criminals_launder/

Bitfury hopefully will reduce some of that to identify dodgy addresses. Not much though, after all they are relatively easy to just create a new one at the drop of a hat. What transacts through those addresses though should not necessary be corruptible. Police don't go through a criminal's shopping receipts to retrieve money paid to local dairies and supermarkets for milk and bread. ;1;0;False;PacificaNorthwestNZ;du2ciza;Nobody blames a currency when criminals launder money, but if they used BitCoin suddenly it’s a BitCoin problem;7wlmog;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7wlmog/nobody_blames_a_currency_when_criminals_launder/

"> And debt is a bad thing by default

Debt is a tool and debt is not inherently bad. Debt is good when used to finance an investment into an asset that will produce long term income or will grow in value. Debt is bad when used to purchase consumables or consumer goods.

The key to debt is moderation.

An economy without debt would be much smaller and would grow much more slowly. Only the rich would have access to capital.";1;1;False;deuteros;du3btca;Millennials Love Bitcoin And Hate Stocks;7w4731;https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2018/02/millennials-love-bitcoin-and-hate-stocks/
