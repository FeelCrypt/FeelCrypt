Awesome it may be, but that isn't what the ad/image says. It's (unnecessarily) pretending Bitcoin can do something it cannot (send dollars anywhere in the world for just $0.01).

"Lenz vs Universal Music is the best case in favor of a DMCA misuse claim. There are others--search through Techdirt or the EFF to find em. 

The problem with any proactive claim for DMCA misuse is that by bringing a misuse lawsuit, you're basically begging to be countersued for copyright infringement. At that point any corporate copyright holder will try to pummel you into submission with litigation tactics and deep pockets. 

IMO, the misuse claim (unless you have real money at stake) is better used as a counterattack to an infringement claim, either to deter a suit or enhance your settlement position.

"I don't agree with the assumption that this is a commercial use. It is clearly the exact sort of ""criticism"" and ""comment"" that fair use is supposed to protect. If WU can shut down legitimate commentary about their services by manipulating copyright law, then we're all in trouble. And even if it is commercial, Acuff-Rose says that is far from the only consideration. 

(BTW, this is why the fight against SOPA and PIPA and the Trans Pacific Partnership are so dammed important)

I'll admit that courts could definitely see it the other way, and litigation is always a crap shoot (and often a shit show). The problem with fair use is that there is no bright line, but the bigger problem is that the lack of a bright line causes far too many people to shy away from the line at all. When that happens, copyright maximalists get to advance their cause because a potential fair user is deterred by the possible cost of being right.

Also, from a practical standpoint, WU is not gonna bring a lawsuit over something trivial like this. This DMCA was probably issued by some staffer somewhere, and I highly doubt that a senior exec or lawyer would risk the potential blowback (and Streisand Effect in favor of Bitcoin) that an actual court case would bring.

Yes, indeed ditto. Except I add Facebook to this too. And because it neatly fits into my life I get to keep in touch with old school and university friends, and family, on a more regular basis. 

I think people (although not necessarily yourself) like to think they're making a statement by disassociating themselves from Facebook because it's too mainstream.

>When an author or artist ridicules a well-known work by **imitating it** in a comedic way. **To the extent that the parodist copies material protected by copyright, the publication may be considered a copyright infringement** unless excused by the fair use defense. The key factor for a parody to qualify as fair use is whether the parody is transformative -- it adds something new, with a further purpose or different character **altering** the copied work with new expression, meaning, or message.

The Western Union advertisement appears to be copied directly, with no ""imitation"" or ""alteration"" of the original work.

"It's not a parody. It's a satire. You're using Western Union's ad in a fashion that could be taken as directly lampooning Western Union. A parody would be the use of their ad in a way that cannot be taken as directly mocking the source, one example being Weird Al's *Eat It*, which was about food, not Michael Jackson, and didn't actually poke fun at the song itself. His take on ""Smells Like Teen Spirit,"" however, would be satire. 

It's important to understand the difference when it comes to copyright claims and such, because parodies often get a lot of leeway when it comes to court (they are not ""inherently protected,"" as many people believe, but there's a lot of precedent for allowing them to persist).
