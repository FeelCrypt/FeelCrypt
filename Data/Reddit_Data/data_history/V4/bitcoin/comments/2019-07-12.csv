Contextually this is the first time a sitting president has said the word Bitcoin publicly. 

[Obama mentioned a Swiss bank account in your pocket.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV8ScIImSCo)

This seemed like a nod to Bitcoin/Crypto at the time, but he did not say the word.

"Right. I think that if people traded wallet to wallet it would be difficult to police. Because what exactly is illegal code? That being said, if ""crypto"" were illegal the feds could get warrants for Google to turn over records of all those that have downloaded crypto apps and wallets. Then they get up addresses. They get warrants for phone companies. Then a warrant for your phone. Then a warrant for your home to search for a password. 

Also, once someone tried to withdraw funds to a federally insured bank account, the feds could get subpoenas for bank accounts that receive funds from certain known crypto-related entities.

"I don't believe Trump is unaware of what printing more money does. It's a race to the bottom. But since the federal reserve note is the reserve currency, it would be the last to go down because of how this fiat system is set up. Printing more dollars would just speed up the entire process and cause a chain reaction around the world. Him announcing that publicly seemed like a threat to the banking cabal. The last thing they want is for the economy to start flushing while Trump is constantly pointing the finger at them when he's been using their tools against them the entire time. They have effectively put themselves into a corner because another round of ""quantitative easing"" would most likely make this house of cards collapse. All through out history when a major fiat money system finally collapses, it always goes back to a gold standard. Until enough time goes by and politicians can convince people gold isn't money. They go back to fiat and it eventually collapse again. The cycle constantly repeats. Study monetary history. Going back to gold isn't an if, it's a when. Why else do you think China has been buying up gold mines around the world for the past decade? Why else do you think central banks around the world have been buying gold and trying to get their gold back from other countries? Because they got nothing else better to do? Use your head and think logically. They are getting ready for the transition. The only thing that is different this time around is Bitcoin. Bitcoin is not going to replace gold, it will supplement it. Paper money will go back to being gold backed, and Bitcoin will reign King as the gold standard of crypto.";1;1;False;dairsensi;etlj6hn;Trump tweets about Bitcoin;cc3l36;https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1149472282584072192

Which should not happen with Bitcoin, your money is your money. Libra on the other hand is just a ""cryptocurrency"" by name and FB is very left-leaning and very pro-censorship.

I can understand why Trump does what he does, although I don't agree with it. He wants to shill the USD to get the economy up for 2020. I would welcome an ancap society, but I've feared that this day would come: Once Bitcoin gets large enough it will be regulated or be made illegal, this isn't a fight between left / right, this is a fight between authoritarian / libertarian.

"The problem is that you seem to view it as an investment, i.e. ""a way to make money"".  In that light, I can understand why you might view Bitcoin as a scam.  In that light, it really can't be anything other than greater fool theory.  You buy some and hope that someone else buys it from you later for a higher price.

However - thankfully - that's not what Bitcoin is.  Bitcoin is a new form of money that isn't tied down by Keynesian economic thinking that has caused every major financial crisis worldwide for the past century.  It's a technological marvel that enables an economic revolution.  Even if it's primarily used as a speculative vehicle at the moment, there's a core base of people that actually get it and don't really care whether it's valued at $10k or $0.10 right now, as long as it continues to provide the properties that it does (these inherent properties will pretty much guarantee a rise in value over the long term; but we're patient and don't care about volatility in the short term).

I highly recommend reading or listening Saifedean Ammous and Andreas Antonopoulos on the topic for economic/political and technical/social aspects of Bitcoin respectively.  I don't always agree 100% with them both, but overall, those are the smartest two people in the field and if anyone can honestly take in what they have to say and can then provide valid and meaningful arguments against Bitcoin as a whole, then I think most of here would love to hear it.";1;1;False;dalebewan;etksgc1;Trump tweets about Bitcoin;cc3l36;https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1149472282584072192

Considering that Bitcoin is mostly owned by people that see governments and central banks as being corrupt and irresponsible, there is a strong possibility that a Bitcoin ban would do nothing or even encourage its growth.

If the US says it's a threat to US financial dominance, nonfriendly governments may want to embrace bitcoin as a way to reduce the US global influence.

"**Iran–Contra affair**

The Iran–Contra affair (Persian: ماجرای ایران-کنترا‎, Spanish: Caso Irán–Contra), popularized in Iran as the McFarlane affair, also referred to as Irangate, Contragate, the Iran–Contra scandal, or simply Iran–Contra, was a political scandal in the United States that occurred during the second term of the Reagan Administration. Senior administration officials secretly facilitated the sale of arms to Iran, which was the subject of an arms embargo. The administration hoped to use the proceeds of the arms sale to fund the Contras in Nicaragua. Under the Boland Amendment, further funding of the Contras by the government (except for the Office of the President and the National Security Council) had been prohibited by Congress.

***

**CIA involvement in Contra cocaine trafficking**

A number of writers have alleged that the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) was involved in cocaine trafficking during the 1980s. These claims have led to investigations by the United States government, including hearings and reports by the United States House of Representatives, Senate, Department of Justice, and the CIA's Office of the Inspector General. The subject remains controversial.

CIA involvement in trafficking is usually alleged to be connected to the Contra war in Nicaragua and the Iran–Contra affair during the Reagan Administration.

"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Bitcoin. Its future applications are extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of computing and economics most of its possible functions will go over a typical investor’s head. There’s also Sitoshis’s free market outlook, which is deftly woven into his creation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Robert Malthus, for instance.

The shills understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of this coin, to realise that it is not just speculation - it says something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Bitcoin truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the brilliance in Satoshi’s brilliant programming method - the “Blockchain,” which itself is a cryptic reference to Haber and Stornetta's Merkle trees. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as our lord and savior's genius wit unfolds itself on their computer screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

If you think that's what Pizzagate was then you never dug into what it is. Did you ever look up spirit cooking with Podesta?

The name was born and a lot of investigation into the lolita express was done and the name of people on them. A lot of those names showed up at that pizza place since a lot were Washington insiders. Then some idiots took that as there's a sex dungeon since they could hear a child screaming in a video (children scream all the freaking time for any reason whatsoever!).

Are you capable of using empathy or even an imagination to project that perhaps not everyone in the world lives in a free country? Would bitcoin be useful to them? If so, would the price of bitcoin increase due to demand increase? Would you want to ride the wave of bitcoin adoption to make money? If no that’s fine but you may find as more and more companies jump on board that your forced into using it in 30 years.

>	I’m not worried about hyperinflation at all.

That’s great. You probably should a little. But even if you don’t, again do you see demand in countries like Venezuela? Zimbabwe? Argentina? Iran? Turkey? Countries that have hyperinflation now?

>	I’ve never spent a single penny on a bank fee, or policy. I keep enough money for a couple months in the bank, the rest is all on the stock market making me actual money.

Hey man that’s great. Me too. I keep an emergency fund at credit union to avoid fees. And I invest in stocks like you. And I have seen how, even though I’m privileged to have a mostly free country, that there is demand for the unbanked and politically oppressed. 

I only have 1% of my portfolio in crypto. That 1% has by far been my best investment but I put that 1% in there because I can see the demand even if I don’t need it for that reason and I like to diversify.

In addition I have value in something that if the government or the banks nuke the current banking system again like in 2008, I have a completely independent source of value. Same reason I hold gold too.

Inflation encourages investment, investment is good as it creates value over time. You have to be finically illiterate to not beat inflation. There’s risk-free investments meant to beat it, that means you will never lose your money.

I don't care what the intention is, if the result is an increase the money supply, and decrease my buying power.

">	You don’t really seem to have much of an understanding of economics.

I understand economics just fine. Let’s take a look at the governments claims (and yours by proxy)

>	inflation is HEALTHY, it is good. Sure the future value of your money will be less than its present value but that’s why there’s treasury inflation protected securities. Risk-free investments that are guaranteed to stay on pace with inflation.

So it’s healthy to lose value? And the only way to protect your value is to invest in securities which are inherently riskier (no such thing as risk free). It’s a system that steals from the people and forces spending. Spending that has caused the average American to have negative net worth. And wouldn’t be able to cover an emergency without more debt. Economists say it’s good for society but ask anyone on the street if they would allow the government to come to their house and take 2% per year they would laugh at you. Economists want spending, but adding debt on the people over and over is unsustainable. 

>	Salaries are in fact going up, they may not outpace inflation, but they are indeed rising.

Ok, so is the person your describing here getting richer or poorer every day? 


>	Anyways, what exactly does crypto have to do with this? Do you think the Fed is causing inflation to fuck over U.S. citizens? Does that realistically make sense?

It’s ego. They think they can control the market and then are shocked when a recession happens. Printing money allows them to build more without taxing the people more. So instead they devalue everyone’s money and use the money they made out of thin air to spend on political promises. Like walls, military, healthcare, welfare. None of these things are possible without printing money unless you tax the people. But it is a secret tax that no one notices until it happens faster and faster.

>	I also have reasoning to believe that you don’t give a single fuck about poor people becoming more poor and you’re simply looking to get rich off of crypto.

Very cynical of you. I just don’t want my money to be devalued. I was poor and I worked hard for it. Inflation is one of the worst things for society. And for some reason people think the US is so smart that it won’t get out of control for them. But turkey, Argentina, Venezuela, Zimbabwe, Germany, Iran, they are all smart too and they have experienced what happens when money is printed too much. 

Also I don’t want governments to forcibly take my money like what happened in Greece.

Really? Why do you think that?

Do you find value in cheaper transactions? Bitcoin when developed has the potential to eliminate middle man drastically reducing the cost to transact.

Do you find value in financial freedom? Do you think China should be able to tell its people what companies they are allowed to transact with? They have the social score now, which if your score is low, keeps certain people from purchasing certain things or flying or leaving the country.

Do you find value in protection from inflation? Venezuela, turkey, Argentina, Iran. These countries have printed too much and created hyper inflation. Do you see value in a currency that isn’t controlled by the government that can allow you to avoid the elimination of your wealth?

Have banks killed you with fees or other predictory practices? You can’t pull your fiat out because then it starts losing value quick. At least your getting a small interest payment in the bank. You can put it in securities but now you have lost liquidity.

-No stance.  He could literally just shut the fuck up.

-Bitcoin is not a competitor to the USD; its minuscule at best and our only real competition is China

-Bitcoin is great, but its not a replacement for USD.

Thats just off the top of my head.

">All through out history when a major fiat money system finally collapses, it always goes back to a gold standard.

What are the examples of this? Fiat currency is only a few decades old. There are no countries on the gold standard today and none that reverted from their fiat money printing past.

On your note about central banks hoarding gold. Central banks use it as a store of wealth which can be exchanged between other central banks. They don't want to hold each others fiat currency when the central bank can just print more. History has proven that no one central bank can be trusted so they use gold as a substitute. This is where Bitcoin has a great deal of potential as it's easy to transfer vast sums of wealth globally without permission of a central authority versus the physical gold bullion that take months (even years) to transfer and is costly.";1;1;False;rjm101;etlnbon;Trump tweets about Bitcoin;cc3l36;https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1149472282584072192

Why do you think that?

Trump has lost more money in his career than he would've made simply investing his initial money in a low to medium return vehicle and done nothing else at all.  His actions - on the whole - have been a net negative to his finances.

As for becoming president: while historically there have been a lot of smart POTUS, there have also been a few relatively dim ones and there's no obvious correlation between intelligence and ability to take a high office in the US once you've adjusted for socioeconomic factors.  Trump is president because he managed to convince a lot of people through fallacious black and white statements.  He appeals to people who would rather switch their brains off and have an easy answer to difficult questions.  Since mass media has been pushing a lot of aspects of US culture in that direction for generations now, it's actually not surprising to see someone who takes this approach ending up becoming the president.";6;0;False;dalebewan;etktd8f;Trump tweets about Bitcoin;cc3l36;https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1149472282584072192

"Fiat currency can be dated back to as early as 11th century China as a receipt for strings of coins made out of base metals. The reason why the coins have holes in the middle was because they were put on a string. A string of 1000 coins was worth about 1.2 ounces of silver. Chinese emperor Wu-ti also had fiat money made from deerskin because he was running out of physical coins to continue his war campaign. How about a more recent example? Congress passes the National Currency Act in 1862 under Lincoln and the introduction of the ""greenback"" dollar goes into circulation, alongside the United States dollar. Yes, we had two different dollars at the same time. One was backed by gold and had more purchasing power than the other, the other was not backed by anything. Guess which one ended up biting the dust... The concept of fiat money is thousands of years old and history is filled with them, every single one of them collapsing. The book Fiat Paper Money: The history and Evolution of our Currency by Ralph T Foster would be a good place for you to start and literally gives you dozens of examples. The spine of the book has strips of actual fiat currencies attached to it that have failed in the past. So your first comment is just flat out wrong due to ignorance. Your second comment just proves my point, lol. What is money supposed to be? A store of wealth that can be exchanged. What is gold? A store of wealth that can be exchanged.";1;0;False;dairsensi;etlrx4q;Trump tweets about Bitcoin;cc3l36;https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1149472282584072192

"While money itself is imaginary there is also the fact that we use it as a means of measuring trade. Trade is the root imaginary concept but necessary for civil social structures based on our Ape brain concepts of fairness and trust.  Beehives do not need this for example, nor the cells in your body as they operate as a single organism.  Because humans do not operate as a single entity we use trade as a mechanism of securing resources for the individual. This imaginary concept of fairness is what gives rise to the liquidity of money in that trade. 

Symbolic issuance of that value transfer be it paper notes, bars of metal, stones, shells, or more modern - bits in a computer; that is the deeper confusion that the population consumes.

I don't think you can compare Bitcoin to prohibition. It doesn't have nearly the traction (popularity) or use compared to a consumable substance.  It's best use case right now is a store of value, if it is banned that goes away. I wouldn't be surprised if the price went below $500 and stays there for a decade if the US banned it right now.;2;3;False;wighty;etkiwid;Trump tweets about Bitcoin;cc3l36;https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1149472282584072192
"It’s not acting as a currency yet. It needs to have value first. Just look at how much money is in it. Are you so arrogant that you think you understand bitcoin more than the people who actually researched how it works and then put their own money into it adding to over 200 billion? 

200 billion. People have valued bitcoin to be that amount. Value of anonymity. Value of cross border transactions without seizure. Value of inflation resistance. Value of speculation on future development.

As it becomes more valuable, more people become comfortable trading it for goods and services. We won’t see that for a while still. Until then it will just be a hedge against crazy politicians.";2;1;False;the_zukk;etm97ul;Trump tweets about Bitcoin;cc3l36;https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1149472282584072192

"yes, i listened to a lot of Andreas Antonopoulos in 2017 and 2018

thats what inspired me to buy bitcoin.

so, i bought some, and i've done since then is lose money on bitcoin

since then, i learned to never listen to the ""experts"" again

it all sounds great, and all these grand ideas, but when i look at the actual numbers i put into bitcoin, and then what i have, i have 20% less than i put in

on the other hand, if i look at the money i put into stocks, that money went up 6% in 2017

9% in 2018

and 8% in 2019.

so, thats not as volatile and flashy as bitcoin, but my stock investment funds with Vanguard are a real work horse, just making me money, slow and steady, every year.

unlike bitcoin, which for me just loses me money every year.  yes i will HODL what i already bought, and sure, all these ""experts"" say it will go up one day for me, and maybe it will.

but all the flowery talk means nothing to me, i just want it to go up in value, and that hasn't happened.  when it does, i'll let you know.";0;1;False;sfxnyc;etl4wum;Trump tweets about Bitcoin;cc3l36;https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1149472282584072192

He isn’t exactly wrong. Bitcoin is, the best that I can describe it, a crap shoot. The value is based entirely on the demand. If more people happen to buy some, then the demand goes a bit up, which makes the value go up, which makes people want to buy it, which makes the value go up. It is way too volatile for no reason. A “Crypto-Whale,” as I am now calling them, could potentially sell a huge amount of bitcoin to saturate the market, lowering the value, and then buy it all back again for less which would make the price jump. These kinds of practices are criminalized when done on stonks, but crypto is not regulated so scummy shot like this can happen.;1;3;False;GebPloxi;etkpczt;Trump tweets about Bitcoin;cc3l36;https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1149472282584072192

It may feel as if the Dollar never could be unseated but I think people in Britain thought that about the pound as well until it wasn’t.

I believe our government is ran by incompetents. I can baze this assertion alone off other Republicans statements. Gary Coh, Jim Mattis, Rex Tillerson, Paul Ryan. And on budgetary and fiscal matter...Bruce Bartlett. Not to mention John Boehner. Our government is ran by morons. And I think a lot of our economic power comes from previous administrations that were headed by people who weren't morons, FDR, Truman, Eisenhower, JFK, LBJ, I associate all those names with competent and level headed leadership for the most part...they all have their flaws.

But Americas track record on leadership has been very spotty lately. And I foresee a debt crisis down the road...and a collapse of the US Treasury bond rating...I don't know if we're going to honor our debt...I've heard a lot of argume ts against taxing our wealthy, our corporations, or super wealthy shareholders. Or even heirs of 8 figure millionaires children, including 9, 10, 11 and 12 figure millionaires and billionaires. And these people have BY FAR the most wealth and income there is to tax. And frankly I just don't see how it's possible to pay off a large portion of $25 trillion in debt without them.

And since that's th3 case, there is a chance US Treasury bonds will collapse as  safe haven for risk free loans, and maybe even the US Dollar as  reserve currency..

And since that's the case and I have no reason to believe why not...I'm dumping a lot of my USD assets and things which has valued tied to the performance of our country's economy and putting them into crypto assets.

So that's my $.02 or 2 satoshis.";2;0;False;SuperJew113;etlbnmm;Trump tweets about Bitcoin;cc3l36;https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1149472282584072192
What about all the corrupt networks Trump is taking down right now… weren’t they all set up and funded with USD? What about corrupt politicians… weren’t they all bribed with USD? Now you catch JP Morgan trafficking $1 BILLION in drugs. All of this was facilitated with USD. Bitcoin is a brand new asset/currency. To say that Bitcoin funds illegal activity and NOT mention the US dollar in the same sentence is totally flawed logic, in my opinion. I know Trump has no choice but to endorse the Fed and the dollar for his re-election.

"Look let's take a look at the meat of the tweet, He seems to be talking about Libra coin. Alright, you have to know what the Libra coin is first to understand this, Libra coin is being pimped by Facebook as an organic Cryptocurrency that they are producing but in reality, it is just a one for one money exchange. Facebook is using the ""Crypto"" concept and our Crypto Community to seem like it is legit but in the end, Facebook will circumvent nations laws.

Libra coin is going to be run by an ""Association"" in Switzerland and will have local offices in every area. So you buy the coin which they ""make"" on-demand (that's the crypto part) then send it, use it to pay, send internationally, etc. The Libra origination will be solely responsible for market value and decided daily. So you put in 1 USD and you get 1 Libra but if the association decided that your 1 libra is worth Half today then you get half. This is nothing more than a Glorified Western Union and that is the main meat of the tweet and I absolutely hate Facebook and this shit coin.

It should also be mentioned that every scammer type startup is involved with the ""Libra association"" including everyone favorite for fees Paypal and of course Thrive  Capital who is Jared Kushner Brother.

"Yeah this seems more targeted at Libra than Bitcoin. I don't think Trump has any major plans RE Bitcoin right now, but the US govt absolutely does not want companies issuing their own currencies.

Currency and the utility of the USD is a major factor in America's power. If big companies start issuing their own currencies (and if Libra is successful - they will), then it's a major threat to the USD. You can imagine an eventual ecosystem where you are making atomic swaps between traditional crypto, company crypto, etc. At this point they are all highly liquid and through a network effect are as widely accepted as the USD.

Libra is forcing the Fed and US Govt to react. It may do some short term collateral damage to Bitcoin, simply by being grouped in as a similar payment system to Libra.

Serious question, how does Bitcoin remain viable in a world trying to be more green?

Haha, those tweets were NOT written by trump he doesn’t even know what a banking charter is. The terminology was way off his usual pre-dementia riddled waffle. The dude is a grade A retard, expert level moron. Bitcoin is not a store of value, it’s a currency. It’s value is not baseless. It’s decentralised and not controlled by a government, if that somehow changes its function then cool, but it doesn’t invalidate it’s currency status. That it’s mostly traded vs spent on product currently makes no difference either. Whomever is writing these tweets knows little and that they feel the need to mention bitcoin and try to invalidate it, goes to show you how scared they are of it and how weak the US dollar is right now.;0;1;False;TriSamples;etlg5x7;Trump tweets about Bitcoin;cc3l36;https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1149472282584072192

I like renewable energy sources, they are great, but there is still a hard cap on total energy production, renewable or now. Although energy production does increase, it doesn't increase 400 % in a year, like Bitcoin has done. We should have a world currency, to avoid exchange charges. It will probably be the Libra, unless a truly decentralized alt gets gUd real fast. Bitcoin is just not going to do it for actual RL use, unless its charges get massively reduced, and its other flaws fixed. Maybe with some kind of awesome second layer, but that clearly isn't ready yet.;1;0;False;HODL_monk;etmcvhk;This sure did age well;cbalwd;https://i.redd.it/3x51z28nyd931.jpg
