"Am not quite sure if this guy is legit or fake, but my account which is enhanced verified with less than 50usd value has been disabled for over a month now and tickets arenâ€™t receiving any reply and there are numerous other people whom I feel very sorry for having quite a large amount in their disabled account, weâ€™re literally loosing money, we couldâ€™ve doubled our money on the past month with the market going up and down but guess what our accounts are still disabled and nobody gives a shit while richela brags about people spamming him on Twitter regarding their disabled accounts literally the worst customer support ever period, I canâ€™t believe such an exchange with all the money theyâ€™re making having such a shit support. I have attached pics proving where I got my btc from, receipts and all that in hopes to speed up the process or atleast receive a reply from an actual human but guess what even their bot ignored me. I know itâ€™s just 50 usd! But I am an international college student been trying to make extra few bucks with my saved money, I can swallow losing it in dips or mistakes that I make but I canâ€™t swallow being scammed or robbed. I invested the same amount with bitfinex exchange and proud to say that I have doubled that amount and so far havenâ€™t had any issues with them.. furthermore I have screenshots to prove everything...

That is a bit of a exaggeration but not impossible. In our lifespan will be more like fiat but between consumers and stores that accept or function only on bitcoin. Something along these lines.;1;0;False;;dpvpzkk;Old but I will never get tired of it;7d7a3o;https://i.redd.it/12m1n65fg7yz.jpg

"100% agree. This was such a woke moment when the penny dropped (pun?) in my head. 

Good to see it still getting airtime, while it may be recycled, it's great for newbies (which there's 00's of 000's).

I agree its mostly speculation, and frankly uptake seems to be virtually nonexistent, but how do futures affect Bitcoin pricing if nobody using futures ends up trading Bitcoin? ;1;1;False;VoDoka;dpux2rg;To everyone who bought in the dip...;7cl909;https://i.redd.it/1ex0gcm7qoxz.jpg
"Because once futures are in play the CME is going to determine the daily spot price of BTC like the COMEX does for PMs.  The spot price will be determined by sampling a number of exchanges, all of which are hardly regulated and will be subject to massive manipulation once Wall Street has a paper vehicle to trade BTC (futures).  They'll manipulate the exchanges to benefit their trades and all ordinary BTC holders will be caught in the middle.

This is no different than what Wall Street currently does to the PM markets except that the BTC community seems to be welcoming Wall Street in with open arms.  My assumption is because the majority of the current BTC community are speculators that are loving the USD price of BTC.";1;0;False;thedudehasabided;dpuy79m;To everyone who bought in the dip...;7cl909;https://i.redd.it/1ex0gcm7qoxz.jpg
