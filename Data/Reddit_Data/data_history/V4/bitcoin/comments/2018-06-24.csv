"Debt is inheritly loaned money and depending on circumstances money can grow faster than required fee on interest. Example when 10k in debt with only 5% yearly interest, if invested you can beat that 5% yearly and that can be seen as profit over debt.

In case of corporations this goes to the extreme where a brand (and stock) value can grow insanely which makes debt irrelevant. A company can turn loss year after year while still growing and thus building wealth. Pretty common these day, especially when looked into companies like Tesla";4;0;False;TheRealMotherOfOP;e1727lz;Don't be like Greg;8t9c6d;https://i.redd.it/7iu2c1vckq511.png

"**Leverage (finance)**

In finance, leverage (sometimes referred to as gearing in the United Kingdom and Australia) is any technique involving the use of borrowed funds in the purchase of an asset, with the expectation that the after tax income from the asset and asset price appreciation will exceed the borrowing cost. Normally, the finance provider would set a limit on how much risk it is prepared to take and will set a limit on how much leverage it will permit, and would require the acquired asset to be provided as collateral security for the loan. For example, for a residential property the finance provider may lend up to, say, 80% of the property's market value, for a commercial property it may be 70%, while on shares it may lend up to, say, 60% or none at all on some shares.

Leveraging enables gains and losses to be multiplied.

I dunno about elsewhere, but capital gains laws in the USA makes it make little sense to cash out all at once. You would owe a gigantic sum in taxes if you had millions and did. Depending on if you believed in Bitcoin or Ethereum or whatever and still wanted to buy back in, you have to now hope prices increase so much in the future to recoupe what you lost in taxes for cashing out and/or hope prices drop so much when bubble burst that you can buy back the difference.

And thus, the higher the price of bitcoin becomes, the poorer we get. See, now Greg has to spend more money to acquire 1 bitcoin, or he now owns less of a piece of the pie at the price rises. His earnings from his job do not rise in proportion. ;1;0;False;_Untermensch;e1746i5;Don't be like Greg;8t9c6d;https://i.redd.it/7iu2c1vckq511.png
"Exactly, thinking about it as one big long play is moronic. It's a constant series of risk/reward. 

If you believe in crypto as religiously as someone who would theoretically hold to 1 million, then the risk, from your perspective is the same at $1 as it is at $500k. But the reward is 1000000x your money, vs 2x your money. The risk to reward calculation is constantly moving away from you, unless your belief in crypto is increasing by orders of magnitude every year. 

Not to mention, historically, assets dont add trillions of dollars in months. Even years is hard. It took gold almost a decade to move from 1 to 8 trillion. So, although 8x your money in a decade is great, that's a lot of time holding crypto, and potentially a lot of scares, and mor importantly, many other opportunities passing you by.

Fair point, my college debts I paid off where 30k but only was 0.1% interest which is astrononcal low, yet still I come from finance and any risk at all is a negative asset imo, definitely concidering cryptocurrency.;2;0;False;TheRealMotherOfOP;e16qav8;Don't be like Greg;8t9c6d;https://i.redd.it/7iu2c1vckq511.png
can you elaborate for a layman? As far as I understand, debt, even with low interest, is not something you want to hold onto long term, much less “build wealth” with 😕;2;2;False;LorryWaraLorry;e16saxq;Don't be like Greg;8t9c6d;https://i.redd.it/7iu2c1vckq511.png

Not sure you understand how interest works. A 200,000 dollar house on a 30 year mortgage with 0 interest would cost $556 a month. With a 5% interest rate the payment goes up to $1074. That’s an extra $518 a month. Even 2.5 % is $234 a month. “Free money”;1;1;False;Trumpets22;e16zvr7;Don't be like Greg;8t9c6d;https://i.redd.it/7iu2c1vckq511.png
"What a stupid FOMO post. Yeah and Sam didn’t play the lottery and didn’t win the 400 mil jackpot. Don’t be like Sam! Everyone go play the lottery! FOMO and gamble!
 
And don’t forget the blackjack tables in Vegas. Someone won a big hand of $100,000 once. I missed out because I didn’t play and wasn’t psychic. Don’t be like me, go gamble! 

FOMO and gamble! It’s the wisest way to live.

"Don't worry Greg. I bought in at 3,000 times more than your 0.06 and made a considerable 500 times more than you. And even on this massive elongated slide to nothing I STILL question if that was the right thing.
