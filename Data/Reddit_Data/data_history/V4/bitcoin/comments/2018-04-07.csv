[Gold hasn't even had tens of years of stability](http://onlygold.com/m/Prices/Prices200Years.asp). And why would it? It's a natural metal whose supply and demand should be expected to fluctuate by chance, with trends, and as technology for mining and using it changes. Trust in this case means trust in stability of the monetary system.;1;0;False;;dwy0ofe;Satoshi chose today's date as his birthday.

">Absent an external catastrophe, if we are just talking about there being a fixed amount of money against a growing total material wealth that it represents, then some of the goods and services produced in a given year will be produce more efficiently than others. That is, some businesses will have a higher profit margin than others.

>The growth in the purchasing power of one unit of a fixed currency is going to result from the average growth. Which means some of the business opportunities that people invested in over that year will have grown faster than deflation and others will have grown slower.

This reasoning is sound using a simplified model of currency that looks only at the total quantity of currency in existence.

However the effective supply of money can be much higher or much lower than the total quantity of currency, which is why the equation of exchange uses Money quantity x Money velocity, not just simple quantity.

The market cannot tell the difference between money that has been lost forever, money that has been destroyed and money that is just sitting under someones mattress or in a vault somewhere. Money only exists to the market when it changes hands.

Deflationary spirals are called spirals because a small amount of initial deflation can increasingly reward pulling money out of circulation. The more money is pulled out of circulation, the higher the deflation rate, and the higher the deflation rate, the more profitable it will be to sit on money instead of using it.

At the beginning of the great depression, when the stock market crashed in 1929, there was only 0% deflation, the year after that it was 2%, and the year after that it was 9%. The amount of wealth lost in the stock market crash was minor compared to the amount of wealth lost in the deflationary spiral it triggered. It was only in 1933, when the government simultaneously seized as much private gold as possible, suspended convertibility of dollars to gold, and a bunch of other countries had gotten off the gold standard and allowed lots of gold to start flowing back to the US the money supply could be increased again and deflation was reversed.

"**Neolithic signs in China**

Since the second half of the 20th century, inscriptions have been found on pottery in a variety of locations in China, such as Banpo near Xi'an, as well as on bone and bone marrows at Hualouzi, Chang'an County near Xi'an. These simple, often geometric, marks have been frequently compared to some of the earliest known Chinese characters appearing on the oracle bones, and some have taken them to mean that the history of Chinese writing extends back over six millennia. However, only isolated instances of these symbols have been found, and they show no indication of representing speech or of the non-pictorial processes that a writing system requires.

"Turing's work _On Computable Numbers_ was instrumental to the invention of the first modern computer, or ""Universal Computing Machine"", but he wasn't the one that developed it. The first such computer was ENIAC, invented by J. Presper Eckert and John Mauchly at the University of Pennsylvania, 1946. It was programmable and turing complete, which means that it could solve hypothetically any problem.

But it depends on what you call a computer- if you stretch the definition a little, you can go further. Turing _did_ contribute to the design of Bletchley's Colossus Computers. They were programmable, but only within a strict set of parameters that related to cryptoanalysis- they weren't turing complete, hence they were not ""Universal Computing Machines"" and did not fulfil Turing's vision.

Also worth mentioning is the Bombe, which which was an electro-mechanical computational device but not a computer and which _was_ inveted by Turing. It could solve specific mathematical problems in order to help crack the daily changes in the German Enigma codes, but it was not programmable and so not a computer as we know it today. Again, it depends on your definition but most today wouldn't tend to call anything that is not turing complete a computer, in modern parlance.

There's also the Z3, the secret German computing device from 1941 destroyed in the bombing of Berlin. It beat the ENIAC to the punchline and was alledgedly turing complete, but only in theory and not so much in practice (for somewhta complicated reasons). A good summary is this quote by  Raúl Rojas, who studied the Z3 closely: ""We can therefore say that, from an abstract theoretical perspective, the computing model of the Z3 is equivalent to the computing model of today's computers. From a practical perspective, and in the way the Z3 was really programmed, it was not equivalent to modern computers.""

Lastly, if you stretch the definition beyond just being turing complete, then the Bombe etc still aren't the first computers. If you did that, you'd have to include analogue computers in which case the winner would be Henry Babbage, who built a simplified version of (his father's) Charles Babbage's theoretical analytical engine's computing unit in 1888.

Hence, the number of bitcoin users is likely less than 28.5 million.";12;1;False;Esmyra;dwytcsa;Bitcoin?;8afz22;https://i.redd.it/fvts38t56fq01.jpg

It's probably a fairer comparison to use ""Pokemon"" as an IP itself rather than Pokemon Go, since Pokemon Go only picked up users that quickly as a result of the existing userbase who were already fanatical fans of the IP.

While a similar argument can be made of things like Internet --> YouTube (people didn't join the internet to play YouTube, they were existing users of the internet who used YouTube once it was made available,) the difference lies in the concept of branding. That is: YouTube wasn't successful by saying ""you like the internet? Check out YouTube, a new product including many familiar characters from the internet. Experience the internet in a different way!"" 

Pokemon Go *did,* though perhaps not in so many words. ""You like Pokemon? Check out Pokemon Go, a new product including many familiar characters from Pokemon.

"I took the course, Tai started from zero in his knowledge about it, so it wasn't the best, but still it's worth the money.  I decided against investing in Bitcoin on account India and China are about to put up a massive resistance to it and they have the capability to destroy it from the inside with access to 51% of the miners. 

I wouldn't have known any of this without Tai.  All the haters on this thread are just mad that Tai is selling the dream at what is now peak bitcoin for the next 15 years while sovereigns start sticking penises in it from every angle.

The hatred on this thread is wayyyyyy oversold.  The guy is selling his knowledge about a phenomenon.  it's a perfectly legitimate business and if you have a problem with that, then you have a problem with civilization itself.  Knowledge is a service, and getting paid for it is a beautiful thing.  Calling him a scammer is just you people having an agenda against him teaching people the truth.

"Often times you have to scroll to the most-downvoted reddit comments to find the real scoop.  I took his courses, they're very well made, I decided that 2018 is peak bitcoin for the next 15 years on account China, India and America are winding up for a bitcoin smackdown because it threatens the federal reserve banking system.  

Tai is an honest guy after timeless truth and selling education as a service.  I'd take the class again because it would prevent me from investing in bitcoin at the peak euphoria.  After China and India start cracking down on miners and making bitcoin ownership and transfers illegal (this is happening literally now), then bitcoin is going to have a decade of hard times.  It will survive, but it needs at least one sovereign as advocate, and it has none.

All the hate on this thread is wayyyyyy oversold.  His courses are long winded, but they give you the real scoop and the reason everyone is mad is that his Erudite analysis basically says don't buy, because 2018 is mountain-peak bitcoin.  The next decade is flat and down.  

You hate hearing truth, so you shoot the messenger.  The course isn't necessary because the conclusion is that Bitcoin has a tough roe to hoe, but shooting the messenger like this is you being the evil you call out in him.

You're all just mad as hell because your favorite instrument is attacking sovereign governments, and you're slated for an ass fucking over the next 15 years.  Tai says it, and that makes you angry.

The vapid content is real, but it's this thread that is the goblin hurling obscenities at timeless truths.  the furious ones attacking Tai Lopez are the ones with big positions in bitcoin.
