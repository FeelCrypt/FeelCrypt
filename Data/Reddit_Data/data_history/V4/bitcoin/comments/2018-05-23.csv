and any other option either failed even harder or has no track record at all because it simply doesn't work to sustain an economy.

In most cases, it's the society or government behind the fiat system that is falling apart and not fiat money itself.

well, globalization wasn't a thing back then. If a country would peg its money to gold it would lose a huge amount of competitiveness because it would overvalue the domestic currency.

Also, it can cause a massive outflow of gold reserves if the real market prices is higher than the pegged gold price. The US lost like half of its gold reserve mostly to European countries during that time.

"""guess what? governments fail over and over again and did so before people even knew fiat""

Of course govts fail over and over again, bureaucrats and politicians tend to often be comprised of inept or corruptible people (hence another reason that their power over the control of a state's economy should be ideally restricted). I'm referring to Fiat monetary policy failing historically many times in different contexts, which is a fact.

""governments spending more money than they have is nothing new and has not that much to do with fiat money. If the US gov. would cut expenses they surely would be able to pay back all the debt very quickly.""

Yes, governments love to spend money that they don't have - and the creation or printing of fiat dollars aids this process, as money is no longer inherently tied to anything of intrinsic value (so it is easier to over-inflate, and is less resemblant of the actual wealth of a society, than a money backed by gold for example), but rather issued at a whim by totally-honest and benevolent central bankers in collusion with governments. 

As for paying the debt back, plus the ever-growing interest it's accruing , ill hold my breath, the national debt doubled under Obama's 8 years in office alone (so in 8 years as much debt was accrued as the 230-odd years of the USA existing beforehand). The debt's growing exponentially. A Fiat system since '71 and policies of leftism , as well as neocons funding the military industrial complex and starting wars all over the damn place, have all contributed to this massive debt problem. The US State can't just cut their expenses, unless they are to drastically reduce their own power (plus the quality of life that the citizenry are now accustomed to, with like 50% of Americans being recipients of some form of state aid or welfare). Statists will pay back the debt and in doing so willingly relinquish vast amounts of their power? And would allow other nations such as China to usurp them geopolitically in the process? No, again I'll hold my breath, they will continue this Fiat game until it meets it's inevitable fate and ends badly. Give central banks and statists the power to print money out of thin air, it doesn't end well, ";1;1;False;OzzyBattla;dzfw9ko;Happy Bitcoin Pizza Day;8latvf;https://i.redd.it/cdbi6znpdfz01.jpg
"> and the creation or printing of fiat dollars aids this process, as money is no longer inherently tied to anything of intrinsic value 

the US government cant print money.

>but rather issued at a whim by totally-honest and benevolent central bankers in collusion with governments.

A central bank lends money to banks and these can buy US-bonds for the market price. There is a reason why a central bank is ""private"" and isn't allowed to directly lend money to a government or should not be directly controlled by a government.


>As for paying the debt back, plus the ever-growing interest it's accruing , ill hold my breath, the national debt doubled under Obama's 8 years in office alone (so in 8 years as much debt was accrued as the 230-odd years of the USA existing beforehand). 

how does the total nominal value matter? what matters is the debt to gdp ratio which was around 110% in the past as well and recovered to <40%

>The debt's growing exponentially. 

the debt to gdp ratio doesn't grow exponentially

>A Fiat system since '71 and policies of leftism , as well as neocons funding the military industrial complex and starting wars all over the damn place, have all contributed to this massive debt problem.

yes, i agree. Wars are expensive.

>The US State can't just cut their expenses, unless they are to drastically reduce their own power

so the debt gave the US the dominating role in the world? sounds like a good investment.

"""A central bank lends money to banks and these can buy US-bonds for the market price. There is a reason why a central bank is ""private"" and isn't allowed to directly lend money to a government or can be directly controlled by a government.""

You don't see any fundamental issues with Fiat monetary policy as opposed to having a gold based monetary system, or a system of money that is tied to assets of intrinsic value? Fiat, apart from being implemented sporadically historically, is a relatively new phenomena, for the majority of human civilisation we've associated our money with assets such as gold, importantly being due to the scarcity and (perceived) inherent/universal value of such assets. Now we've handed over control of our monetary management and supply to a cabal of elitists and bureaucrats, who are more than capable of making human error which can have highly negative consequences for our society. 

""the debt to gdp ratio doesn't grow exponentially"" 

Yes well it would have been interesting in '08 hadn't the State bailed out the corporate criminals, and actually let events play out on a natural or even moral basis. Let alone policies such as quantitative easing, artificially injecting the economy with helicopter money. Temporary bandaid solutions for a much larger underlying wound. 

""yes, i agree. Wars are expensive.""

And immoral. Perhaps without fake fiat dollars the West would be more hesitant to constantly poke the hornets nest in the Middle East, stirring up tensions before deciding it's a great idea to let millions of third worlders from often extremely divergent cultures come and settle in western nations, often on the public purse? Again, not the fault of the average man, it's the fault of govts, aided and abetted by an endless supply of sweet Fiat to keep the machine running. 

""so the debt gave the US the dominating role in the world? sounds like a good investment.""

I wouldn't say the debt made US the most powerful State, Europe had already crippled itself as with China and Japan during WW2 through massacring the shit outta each other, America was much less harmed, aside from their immediate costs associated with their late entry to the war, they didn't have too much debt and went on to boom in the late 40s and 50s largely through ingenuity, production and a strong work ethic. They've since gone heavily into debt with the increase in the size of their state and state programs, welfare, proxy wars and economic mismanagement (all empires rise and fall after all). So I don't expect the elite or Statists in America to willingly or altruistically reduce the size of the state apparatus (which costs trillions to run, with all the McGubbment workers and programs) in order to pay their debts, because that would reduce their own power, and result in many angry and desperate citizens (the Free Shit Army is accustomed to receiving milk from the government teat now, and if [note: when] it ever runs dry, it won't be pretty). 

""bitcoin will sooner or later find its end as well... like everything else.""

I guess we shall see what happens. It may not end up being Bitcoin, something may replace it in future, but I view a decentralised peer to peer currency as being both an enormous technological advancement as well as a good hedge, amongst other assets, to safeguard (and as it's shown in many cases, to even exponentially increase) one's personal wealth.";1;1;False;OzzyBattla;dzg1f4y;Happy Bitcoin Pizza Day;8latvf;https://i.redd.it/cdbi6znpdfz01.jpg

"The thing is, it doesn't have to replace fiat. There are multiple currencies right now and I really don't see that changing any time soon. (Even if only for the simple reason that it is so easy to safely record transactions in a blockchain data structure)

 Single chain may mean additional security, but how the fuck do you expect to orchestrate transactions (for example) from the outer rim of the andromeda galaxy? 

Future physics may change this, but as things are now, things start to break at the latest when light speed is not _enough_ to send a transaction to a block in a reasonable timeframe.

The ""only"" solution with current technology is to run multiple chains (""alt-coins""), so that when physical signal coverage starts to become an issue, we can create even more localized chains that are backed with holdings of another currency in another network, for the people at insanely far distances from home to use for daily interactions, that are then traded for the more established currencies (with less liquidity obviously) when moving between coverage areas or we're yet again left with money that cannot be freely moved on a whim.

"Ok, here are my thoughts about this \(because I am giving up, because I think this is way over my level if I am even remotely right\). Lets get through all the clues first

3. Code easily, attack early
4. Lost transaction costs almost users
5. 00212121

9. \-1

**WHAT DOES THIS ALL MEAN???????**

**MY ANSWER:**

**First off**, I think, that the picture does not have the seed words to the bitcoin address. Even if it does, it might not be systemically linked together, rather than scattered across.

**Second**, I think that the whole picture is just a bacground for decoding the private key through **Elliptic Curve Cryptography and the finite \(prime\) field.** [LINK](https://medium.com/chain-intelligence/tldr-guide-bitcoin-private-key-public-key-and-public-address-623ad99768c3)

I base my opinion because:

**Second** **clue**: Think in pairs.

>Bitcoins themselves are not stored either centrally or locally and so no one entity is their custodian. They exist as records on a distributed ledger called the block chain, copies of which are shared by a volunteer network of connected computers. *To ""own"" a bitcoin simply means having the ability to transfer control of it to someone else by creating a record of the transfer in the block chain. What grants this ability? Access to an* [*ECDSA*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_DSA) ***private and public key pair*** What does that mean and how does that secure bitcoin? [LINK](https://www.coindesk.com/math-behind-bitcoin/)

I think the first clue is given as gentle nudge into this direction.

**Third** **clue:** code easily, attack early.

Even though all of these words can my acceptable BIP39 words, there is one problem: Attack early is next to each other, and that is ok, but code and easily are seperated quite significantly. How does this help? I think it falls right into the ECDSA theory quite well. These are probably the points on the Elliptic curves, on the  finite \(prime field\). **Same thing goes for the fourth, seventh and sixth clue.**

**Fifth clue**: 00212121

Honestly, I cant remember, but I saw, that an 8 digit number of somesort is also significant to this ECDSA thing, but I honestly cannot find the page I found this.

**Sixth and ninth clue**: Try \+1, \-1. 

Since \-1 is nowhere to be found on the picture, it reminded me that, that there exists a group law on the set of all points on a given elliptic curve \(**where \-1 IS significant**\). See [LINK1](https://medium.com/chain-intelligence/tldr-guide-bitcoin-private-key-public-key-and-public-address-623ad99768c3) [LINK2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generating_set_of_a_group)

**Eitht** **bonus clue**: To triumph, one must look within. To **infinity**, and beyond. When you are close to home, X marks the spot.

It so happens, that **there is also a point of infinity on the ECDSA curve AND on the picture**. [LINK1](https://medium.com/chain-intelligence/tldr-guide-bitcoin-private-key-public-key-and-public-address-623ad99768c3) [LINK2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_at_infinity) [LINK3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_cryptography)

**These coincidences leave me to believe, that the picture is a an encrypted map of the private key. If so, I believe, that if the picture would be decrypted with the ECDSA curve** ***OR SOMETHING IN THAT NATURE*** PERHAPS, you could find the private key, or at least come closer to it.

"Could there be any technical reason why the P=0.000... numbers from the whitepaper (they come together with the z= numbers) are not in this puzzle? I find it hard to believe that, since we have both numbers containing decimal points (q=035) and number from the second column in the tables (z=24) present. Which means the author has deliberately removed these from the puzzle, maybe as a hint.

These numbers proves/shows the ""security model"" of Bitcoin, which this puzzle ""challenges"" (by removing them).

I don't really know what to make of this, but I'm playing with the idea that we are looking at some kind of block race of two chains, and the ""pairs"" are the blocks from the two chains. The race would then finally be resolved by the 13th block (which would only be one word acting as the passphrase to unlock the wallet, hence the +1). Since the change to the puzzle now probably that extra block has been removed.

EDIT: ""reflects on the elements that brought this technology to life"" - blocks/blockchain..

EDIT2: also look at the number of clues around the ”block chain” words.. ”code attack early”, ”try +1”, ”00212121” (by the way this clue is probably connected to the fact that those numbers are so close to each other), there is also an arrow (=>) pointing from ”block” to ”chain”...";7;6;False;tobbeben;dzfg5eo;1 BTC is hidden in this puzzle.

"Okay, it's time for me to throw in the towel for today so let me share some insights.

**\-\- Image Manipulation \-\-**

First of all, I went the path of analyzing the image itself for anomalies. And lo and behold, **there are letters that are clearly marked with an orange hue**. Take a look at weaknesses, where **two of the three, but not the third ""s"" are marked.** And just look at that outstanding 257! :

[https://imgur.com/a/lzG8SfZ](https://imgur.com/a/lzG8SfZ)

I gave up this path quite quickly though, since these anomalies are not in plain sight. They could however reveal something about how the image has been edited. I saw this by importing the PNG to Inkscape 0.91 and using the Saturation Map filter.

**\-\- 00212121 \-\-**

I mention this because I think that it has not been mentioned yet: **The fact that 0, 1 and 2 are so close to each other in the puzzle can't be a coincidence, in fact it is one of the most visible clues of them all.**

*So what can that mean?*

Either it is just there to draw attention to the 0.00212121 transfer that occurred in relation to the funding of the price address. In this case it is 00212121 that is the clue. Or, 00212121 is there to draw attention to the area around 0, 1, 2 in the puzzle. Somehow I think that the latter makes more sense since there have been so many clues around that area \(attack, early, code, ""Try \+1"", infinity, and maybe 00212121 itself\).

If 00212121 is the actual clue, I think it is related to the generation of BIP39 seeds. A BIP39 seed is constructed by a series of eight three\-tuples of words. One digit could represent one three\-tuple. For example it could be the number of words of each tuple that has a certain property.

**\-\- Limited area \-\-**

Speaking of areas in the puzzle, it is noteworthy that **all ""clue words"" has landed within a quite small total area**. First of all, they are obviously all in the white part of the puzzle. But even within the white part we are mostly confined to an area around 8:30 \- 10 o'clock and 3\-9 o'clock. **I think even the clue ""almost open"" might refer to the word ""open"" being ""almost"" in the area of interest** which would mean that the famous ""X"" might mark the area boundary, perhaps together with the infinity sign in the northwest.

**\-\- ""Missing P:s theory"" \-\-**

" Ok, here are my thoughts about this \(because I am giving up, because I think this is way over my level if I am even remotely right\). Lets get through all the clues first

1. You can throw out at least half of the words in the picture
2. Think in pairs
3. Code easily, attack early
4. Lost transaction costs almost users
5. 00212121
6. Try \+1
7. Almost open
8. Bonus clue: To triumph, one must look within. To infinity, and beyond. When you are close to home, X marks the spot. \(from here\)
9. \-1

**WHAT DOES THIS ALL MEAN???????**

**MY ANSWER:**

**First off**, I think, that the picture does not have the seed words to the bitcoin address. Even if it does, it might not be systemically linked together, rather than scattered across.Second, I think that the whole picture is just a bacground for decoding the private key through **Elliptic Curve Cryptography and the finite \(prime\) field.** [LINK](https://medium.com/chain-intelligence/tldr-guide-bitcoin-private-key-public-key-and-public-address-623ad99768c3)

I base my opinion because:

**Second** **clue**: Think in pairs.

>Bitcoins themselves are not stored either centrally or locally and so no one entity is their custodian. They exist as records on a distributed ledger called the block chain, copies of which are shared by a volunteer network of connected computers. *To ""own"" a bitcoin simply means having the ability to transfer control of it to someone else by creating a record of the transfer in the block chain. What grants this ability? Access to an* [*ECDSA*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_DSA) ***private and public key pair***\*\*.\*\* What does that mean and how does that secure bitcoin? [LINK](https://www.coindesk.com/math-behind-bitcoin/)

I think the first clue is given as gentle nudge into this direction.

**Third** **clue:** code easily, attack early.Even though all of these words can my acceptable BIP39 words, there is one problem: Attack early is next to each other, and that is ok, but code and easily are seperated quite significantly. How does this help? I think it falls right into the ECDSA theory quite well. These are probably the points on the Elliptic curves, on the  finite \(prime field\). **Same thing goes for the fourth, seventh and sixth clue**

**Fifth** **clue**: 00212121

Honestly, I cant remember, but I saw, that an 8 digit number of somesort is also significant to this ECDSA thing, but I honestly cannot find the page I found this.

**Sixth** **and** **ninth** **clue**: Try \+1, \-1. Since \-1 is nowhere to be found on the picture, it reminded me that, that there exists a group law on the set of all points on a given elliptic curve \(**where \-1 IS significant**\). See [LINK1](https://medium.com/chain-intelligence/tldr-guide-bitcoin-private-key-public-key-and-public-address-623ad99768c3) [LINK2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generating_set_of_a_group)

**Eitht** **bonus clue**: To triumph, one must look within. To **infinity**, and beyond. When you are close to home, X marks the spot. It so happens, that **there is also a point of infinity on the ECDSA curve AND on the picture**. [LINK1](https://medium.com/chain-intelligence/tldr-guide-bitcoin-private-key-public-key-and-public-address-623ad99768c3) [LINK2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_at_infinity) [LINK3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_cryptography)

**These coincidences leave me to believe, that the picture is a an encrypted map of the private key. If so, I believe, that if the picture would be decrypted with the ECDSA curve** ***OR SOMETHING IN THAT NATURE*** **PERHAPS, you could find the private key, or at least come closer to it.**
