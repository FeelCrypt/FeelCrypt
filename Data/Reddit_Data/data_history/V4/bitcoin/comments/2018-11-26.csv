""The state shouldn't be involved in areas where the private sector could do it better and it's worth exploring where this might be the case, while ensuring that the private sector does indeed do it better""

"Good points to be honest but I think anything people want to buy will offer them utility because why else would they buy it in the first place?

What about a company that makes collectibles such as art? Say the company makes $100 a year profit and has some random P/E depending on how many share they have. In this case case you would say it has value since the value of the stock is backed by the profit generating ability of the company. However, at the very core, the value would still be based on how people value art since the company is just a aggregation of art being sold, which from a naive view has no economic utility. If people value art higher, the company makes more money and has a higher P/E, if they value art lower the reverse happens. Hence, the value of the stock will be just determined by the subjective view of people on the underlying product.

This brings me to my point which is that a pen, art or bitcoin should be seen as equivalent since they should provide some utility to the user to justify buying them. A pen allows you to write, art gives pleasure when viewed and Bitcoin might be appealing to some hardcore libertarians who gain value from using a anti-central bank currency or some criminals who want to buy goods illegally online. Hence, I think it is wrong to say Bitcoin has zero economic value since it certainly can have a lot of value for some people. However, for something to have utility it doesn't even have to be rational from our perspective. Someone might find utility in Bitcoin because their name is Bob and Bitcoin starts with a B as well and they feel happy about that and they would be completely justified in their view.

">I can send electronic payments anywhere in the world today.

False. See the [Wikileaks banking blockade](https://wikileaks.org/Banking-Blockade.html) or the financial censorship of donations to Edward Snowden or [other PayPal-related financial censorship](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/02/legal-censorship-paypal-makes-habit-deciding-what-users-can-read) or the [Cyprus bank bail-ins](https://voxeu.org/article/bank-bail-ins-lessons-cypriot-crisis) (and other similar historical examples) for cases where people have been prevented from using, accessing, or transferring the money that ostensibly belonged to them. See also: Darknet Markets.

You can't send electronic payments anywhere in the world today without Bitcoin (or something like it) because doing so requires centralized transaction approval that is (at least in some cases) not actually granted.

You can go ahead and try to move the goalposts now if you really want to, but your statement here is objectively false.

> Far faster and cheaper that BTC. 

Also false. Bitcoin transaction finalization takes *minutes* (or *hours* if you want to be ultra-safe) whereas legacy financial transaction settlement and finalization generally takes *months*.

Of course, this is abstracted away from the direct user experience so that you don't have to acknowledge it directly in most scenarios and contexts, but it is the simple fact of the matter. Otherwise, chargebacks and other consumer-protection services simply wouldn't be possible. You have essentially fallen for an illusion (one which is possible to create in Bitcoin, too, of course, but which there isn't a particularly pressing demand or market priority for at the moment).

Furthermore, plenty of money transmission service providers charge percentages of the total amount transferred, whereas Bitcoin uses a (market competitive) fees-per-weight-unit mechanism that allows effectively flat-rate transfers no matter the total value being sent *and* payment-channel solutions that can reduce fees-per-payment down to virtually zero-cost without incurring custodial/trust-related risks or concerns into the mix.

So, again, what you have said here is false and indicates little more than ignorance on your part.

>And the recipent can actually use the funds. 

The same is true in the case of Bitcoin.

>And the funds won't lose 20% value in a week.

That entirely depends on the form that the funds take. History is rife with examples of national currencies collapsing *much* worse than ""20% in a week"", from the hyperinflation seen in the Weimar Republic, Zimbabwe, Russia, Venezuela, and countless others. This phenomenon has continued to occur all over the world to this day.

The ""standard troll response"" to this historical insight is to take the ""No True Scotsman"" approach, trying to narrow the scope of discussion to ""big"" currencies like the US Dollar... [but even that argument is bunk, and would mostly just show that you're historically ignorant](https://i.imgur.com/bhuB74D.jpg).

>Bitcoin is a collectible. Pure and simple.

This is **true**, because ""collectible"" just means ""worth collecting; of interest to a collector"" and Bitcoin definitely qualifies under this standard definition. Unfortunately for your thesis, this isn't a bad thing.

> It has zero economic value,

This is obviously false, as Bitcoin has facilitated plenty of trade (again, research Darknet Markets to learn more) and thus has provided direct economic value, whether you like it or not.

> it is worth exactly what someone will pay for one, no more no less. 

This is true of **literally anything**.

>It is not a currency,

False, [by definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency). It is not a *national* currency, but it is definitely a currency (and a commodity, and a collectible, and a network, and a consensus protocol, and many many more things).

> it generates no income,

False, again [by definition](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/income).

> no dividend,

Arguably fork/airdrops like BTG and BCH represented Bitcoin dividends.

Pretty much every claim you have made, and every ""argument"" you've put forth, has been completely false and just demonstrated how ignorant you are. You seem to be a bitter and jealous troll, which we have no shortage of around here, but you're not even bright enough to sound even *slightly* clever or mix in enough truth to make your comment more credible. I could expand upon the neat use-cases that Bitcoin allows which simply aren't possible with pre-Bitcoin tech (like the ability to *memorize a few words and store your funds in your mind* and then waltz across national borders easily, or to create and execute smart contracts that require no human arbitration whatsoever) but it wouldn't do any good, because you're not here to learn more and grow as a person, you're here to troll and spread misinformation.

Oh well. Your bitterness and ignorance will shape your life in unenviable ways, so I suppose there's not much reason for me to rub it in.";8;1;False;thieflar;eagwkmj;You never know;a08mxp;https://i.redd.it/7cszfhuofh021.png

"> Nothing has any ""fundamental value"" contrary to popular belief.

Sure it does. If a public company makes $100 a year in profit, and has 4 shares available in the open market, those shares has a base value of at least $25, since they represent 1/4th ownership in a company that's has $100 in profit. That's how stock prices are determined, they are based on multiples of the share price related to earnings. This is called a P/E ratio. Companies that have higher P/E's are priced that way because investors think the company will make more money in the future, so the existing shares will be worth more. In the previous example, say that company that makes $100 a year is about to come out with a new product that is projected to make the company an additional $100 a year, bringing their total to $200 a year. Each of the 4 outstanding shares would then have a book value of $50. So investors will pay more than the $25 they are worth now because they expect them to be worth $50 in the future.

You are correct. Art is a collectible, the same asset class as a Bitcoin. I never said collectibles cannot have value. Of course they can. But their value is not derived from any underlying economic value. Just the emotional attachment a purchaser has for the item. 

> What is the fundamental value of a chair or a pen?

They offer utility. In economic terms, utility is a measure of how a product or good performs a task or service. Chairs allow a person to sit. Since sitting is something people want to do, and they need a chair to do it, people will pay money to gain the utility the chair offers. Same with a pen. 

> Similarly, people are justified in putting a price on Bitcoin just for the reason that they actually value it at something for some weird reason.

Correct, they have an emotional attachment to Bitcoin, like any other collectible. That's where the value lies, since bitcoin offers no economic value (it doesn't sell a good/service and generate profit, so you can't derive it's value from that, and it offers no utility, so you can't derive it's value from that)

Historically collectibles overall are a pretty shitty asset class to invest in, sure there are plenty of stories about the collectibles that reach insane values, but for every one of those stories there are thousands of unreported stories of other collectibles going to zero. But the asset class is very popular because it touches on a very base desire of people, the desire to make money without working for it.

"> Good points to be honest but I think anything people want to buy will offer them utility because why else would they buy it in the first place?

Belief they can make money without working for it. Same reason a lot of people invest in collectibles. It's a proven fact that people HAVE made millions off Bitcoin. That's a powerful endorsement. 

> What about a company that makes collectibles such as art? Say the company makes $100 a year profit and has some random P/E depending on how many share they have. In this case case you would say it has value since the value of the stock is backed by the profit generating ability of the company. However, at the very core, the value would still be based on how people value art since the company is just a aggregation of art being sold, which from a naive view has no economic utility. If people value art higher, the company makes more money and has a higher P/E, if they value art lower the reverse happens. Hence, the value of the stock will be just determined by the subjective view of people on the underlying product.

There are companies that sell collectibles, and in fact they are viewed as far riskier investment specifically because of that. Their bond issues have to give double digit returns to find buyers, and their stocks can be extremely volatile.

But even in that case the company still has hard assets. Desks, computers, buildings, etc that are worth something, giving it a book value. And if the company does make a collectible, and it isn't popular, the company goes bankrupt and it's stock is worth $0.

> This brings me to my point which is that a pen, art or bitcoin should be seen as equivalent since they should provide some utility to the user to justify buying them

A pen allows you to write, so it has actual utility. Art and bitcoins are both collectibles, neither has utility. 

> Hence, I think it is wrong to say Bitcoin has zero economic value since it certainly can have a lot of value for some people.

It can have value to a person, but that value is not based on economic utility. Collectibles aren't valued like that. 

>  However, for something to have utility it doesn't even have to be rational from our perspective. Someone might find utility in Bitcoin because their name is Bob and Bitcoin starts with a B as well and they feel happy about that and they would be completely justified in their view.

"> Yes you can invest in currencies, but they are still different to say stocks in some ways.

Correct, you can invest in currencies and they are valued differently than stocks. The driver of the value of a currency is the economic policy and overall economic well being of the issuer. The US Dollar is worth more than the Venezuelan Bolivar due to the US's economic policies and GDP vs Venezeuela's. Bitcoin itself is not issued by anything, that's one of it's features, so it is not a currency. 

Here's the difference: A currency has value because an authority SAYS it has value. A non currency has value because people BELIEVE it has value. If I decide a US dollar is worthless, that doesn't make it so, because the US government say it has value. It is backed by them. If I decide a Bitcoin is worthless, no one can challenge that. Personally I wouldn't pay 1 penny for a Bitcoin. It is a worthless asset to me. Someone else may say it's worth $10k. But that's an entirely subjective opinion not backed by anything. That's not a currency. That's a collectible. It's worth what they viewer states it is worth, backed by no actual economic activity or utility. No different than art, a comic book, a Pog, etc. 

I would go so far to say that when you trade someone a Bitcoin for something, thats closer to being a barter vs a purchase. 

> For example, I wonder how Barron/you would argue for why our current fiat currencies having any value? What are they based on? What is the intrinsic value of a dollar? From one perspective it is only due to the raw power of the state forcing us to pay our taxes in it. We are literally forced to use our current currencies which is why they have value.

You answered your own question. Dollars have value cause the US government says it does. I'm not going to get into the sociopolitical ideologies behind whether that is a good or bad thing, that's a different topic altogether. I personally feel that any sufficiently advanced economy requires a centrally managed currency in order to provide buyers and sellers a level of trust that what they are accepting as currency today will have value tommorow). While the anarcho-capitalism argument might be an interesting thought experiement/discussion, it doesn't imbue value in Bitcoin. 

> If everyone in the world used Bitcoin, and our governments forced us to pay taxes in Bitcoin, then you would be hard pressed to say it did not have value since it would be the only available currency in this world and you could not buy anything with it.

Correct. If the US government decided to abandon the dollar and adopt Bitcoin as the currency of the US, then Bitcoin would be a currency. If that happened, Bitcoin would just become fiat, since the government would by necessity have to own all methods of producing Bitcoin in order to actually control the monetary supply. If not, people could just make their own money causing a massive deflationary spiral that  would render the currency worthless. Unregulated markets don't work as currencies. 

> Now, you could say very simply, that the more people who use Bitcoin, the more value it will have, since it will allow you to trade with more people.

You don't need Bitcoin to trade with people, so it doesn't ""enable"" trade. Bitcoin would need to provide some utility or value to be accepted as barter by people. To date, the only utility Bitcoin offers is the ability to anonymously transact in illicit goods, so I will acknowledge that as utility that Bitcoin offers, but personally I wouldn't invest in that

Just zoom out on the charts my dude. Learn what Proof of Work algorithms achieve in a sense outside of Bitcoin and how hashes are used to link together data and provide quick(er) methods to verify transactions. 

The coin is worth whatever some guy will pay for it, but the techniques and programming paradigms that gave rise to Bitcoin (please read the white paper and look At the OPEN source code on github) hold immense value.

"Crypto currency branding is hugely important. The value of the network is the number of others on the network. Those coins were probably just copies of Bitcoin that provided no new innovation and as such were unable to survive. Just like the value proposition for switching to self driving will have to be many orders better than manual driving, for another coin to supplant Bitcoin with its network effect and first mover advantage it'll require far better tech.

Your trolling is obvious and embarrassing.

As to your ""I hope you wise up and salvage some $$ before Bitcoin disappears"" bit, don't worry about me, I've realized tens of thousands of percents of profits from Bitcoin over the years, and spent them on other things that have improved my life in significant ways.

That's a factor in its value. Can you explain to me why that's not true? If a coin is known as that fad all the kids lost their money on it will result in low price. If it's that thing that everyone is gonna get rich of off the price will go up.

"I am a Bitcoin skeptic but everything's value is derived from what someone else will pay for it. Nothing has any ""fundamental value"" contrary to popular belief. Art does not give any obvious benefits but people still sell and buy it with a market price. What is the fundamental value of a chair or a pen? Similarly, people are justified in putting a price on Bitcoin just for the reason that they actually value it at something for some weird reason.";1;1;False;;eahscio;You never know;a08mxp;https://i.redd.it/7cszfhuofh021.png
