"I'm not arguing that he wasn't doing illegal things. The response above is a good example of what bothers me. It simply does not matter if he was guilty or not on the murder-for-hire allegations for the purposes of this case. By allowing those allegations to become the focal point of the debate, attention is taken away from the blatant issues of the trial. 

Further, there should be no excuse for a trial not to follow the constitutional chain of justice. In this case, Ulbricht's guilt is assumed regarding the murder-for-hire. However likely or unlikely his guilt is isn't the point, so much as the issues that are caused by the assumption of guilt without a trial. His sentencing reflects this assumption of guilt, which creates a precedent. Just because it is inconvenient to have a trial to determine punishment, does not mean that a trial shouldn't be had... which is essentially what your argument entails. The sentencing needs to reflect that which was actually tried, and the trial needs to follow the laws it represents. 

For the record... though it is unrelated to my main point... I don't think that the main issue with the murder-for-hire's legitimacy is that no-one was killed. Obviously, the first problem is that there is a right to a trial, as mentioned above. Beyond that is the evidence of multiple people using the DPR account, including, but not limited to, it having been logged into after he was incarcerated.

Where did I mention node counts in speaking of decentralization? I spoke in terms of cost to independently validate. The only context in which I mentioned **indirectly** node counts was how it factored into the equation for people _not running nodes_, and that was not speaking to decentralization but to the nature of the trust based relationships they engage in. ;1;0;False;shinobimonkey;di7idu6;PSA: If you're new here and wondering how bitcoin works, take an hour or two to read through the whitepaper.

"No problem. I just hate how most of the time people tend to not try and make an argument. It's like if people tend to care more about ""winning the argument"" rather than being right. Personally I don't quite buy that SegWit will magically allow unlimited off-chain transactions, because that means you just move the problem elsewhere. Those transactions have too be stored somewhere even if it's not on the BlockChain. And once you're at that point you kind of lose the advantage of what made BlockChain transactions so great.";1;0;False;manly_;di7oy47;PSA: If you're new here and wondering how bitcoin works, take an hour or two to read through the whitepaper.

Bitcoin doesn't require very much knowledge in terms of cryptography (although Satoshi clearly knew a lot more than the average person). OTOH it did require a very deep understanding of (parts of) game theory in order to not just come up with the concept, but to also make it work this well. The whole PoW + incentive scheme came out of left field and wasn't anticipated by anybody.;6;0;False;Natanael_L;di7hrdc;PSA: If you're new here and wondering how bitcoin works, take an hour or two to read through the whitepaper.

Yeah there's a script language for how to run transactions. It has no loops intentionally. But it was never formally put in a whitepaper. I know since I searched specifically for it as I wrote my own BlockChain parser from scratch. The official documentation literally says to look at the source code to figure out how that scripting language works. Which is kind of very appalling, but whatever. The foundational papers of bitcoin basically describe the BlockChain, which is the real innovation.;1;0;False;manly_;di7pwmc;PSA: If you're new here and wondering how bitcoin works, take an hour or two to read through the whitepaper.

"LN + Segwit still limits the maximum UTXO rate per block, at a few thousands. This means that even 1 MB blocks full of nothing but new transactions from new people buying into Bitcoin and establishing LN wallets would require MONTHS just to on-board ONE medium sized country's citizens. 

In other words, a Bitcoin without larger blocks CAN NOT allow for fast growth, unless we skip straight to onboarding via transactions in larger softforked extensions blocks, not touching main-block UTXO:s.";1;0;False;Natanael_L;di7i7w0;PSA: If you're new here and wondering how bitcoin works, take an hour or two to read through the whitepaper.
