So every bad part about Edison's life is magnified whereas every good part about Tesla's is magnified.

Tesla's main contribution was the \*commutatorless\* AC motor, but nobody claims that he stole the idea from earlier AC motors, and some people, and that Oatmeal comic about Tesla, go as far as to claim that he ""invented AC"". This is ridiculous because AC was around before he was born. And Tesla and Edison wouldn't have had anything to do with each other at all except that Tesla worked at Edison's lab for a short amount of time and sold a patent to Edison's competitor. So yeah, they're two men who didn't actually have much to do with each other, and probably only met each other a few times at Edison's lab.

Tesla tried to develop a death ray and was an ardent supporter of eugenics. See how easy that is?

EDIT: Also, I really doubt Edison actually thought that AC was superior, because if he did, the smart business decision was to switch to AC like a lot of his employees had been telling him to. He was erring on the side of caution due to the perceived danger associated with the higher voltages involved in AC. This was a period of about five years where he made a misjudgment about a technology, but it's overshadowed by his other accomplishments, like creating one of the first industrial labs where great minds came together and made entire new industries.";5;2;False;summerfr33ze;e0s342w;Bitcoin?

"**War of the currents**

The war of the currents (sometimes called battle of the currents) was a series of events surrounding the introduction of competing electric power transmission systems in the late 1880s and early 1890s. It included commercial competition, a debate over electrical safety, and a media/propaganda campaign that grew out of it, with the main players being the direct current (DC)–based Edison Electric Light Company and the alternating current (AC)–based Westinghouse Electric Company. It took place during the introduction and rapid expansion of the alternating current standard (already in use and advocated by several US and European companies) and its eventual adoption over the direct current distribution system. Three aspects have been conflated into the ""war"": open competition involving large electric companies and a format war involving their developing systems, a general fear in the public's mind of death by accidental electrocution from high voltage AC leading to a debate over its safety and regulation, and the debate and behind-the-scene maneuvers associated with the introduction of the electric chair.

"I'm not an EE so maybe you are and know something that I don't know but converting voltages in AC is still far easier than in DC. 
 With AC, if you wrap  an iron core with 10 wraps of wire connected to the source and 20 wraps of wire connected to the output, you'll  magically doubles the voltage. The reverse halves it.  You can pretty much get any voltage you want and need relatively cheaply and efficiently.   

You need long distance transmission? No problem, get the ratio right and you'll get 155,000 to 765,000 volts.  You have an office building that needs 480 volts? No problem, put in a transformer at the pole that converts the city line from 10,000 volts down to 480 and in the office you have another transformer that converts 480 to 120 volts for the outlets and keeps the 277/480volt for the lights.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_currents

***Brown's demonstrations
Brown, determined to prove alternating current was more dangerous than direct current, at some point contacted Thomas Edison to see if he could make use of equipment to conduct experiments.[fn 2] Edison immediately offered to assist Brown in his crusade against AC companies. Before long, Brown was loaned space and equipment at Edison's West Orange, New Jersey laboratory, as well as laboratory assistant Arthur Kennelly.

Brown paid local children to collect stray dogs off the street for his experiments with direct and alternating current.[64] After much experimentation killing a series of dogs, Brown held a public demonstration on July 30 in a lecture room at Columbia College.[65] With many participants shouting for the demonstration to stop and others walking out, Brown subjected a caged dog to several shocks with increasing levels of direct current up to 1000 volts, which the dog survived. Brown then applied 330 volts of alternating current which killed the dog. Four days later he held a second demonstration to answer critics' claims that the DC probably weakened the dog before it died. In this second demonstration, three dogs were killed in quick succession with 300 volts of AC.[66] Brown wrote to a college that he was sure this demonstration would get the New York Board of Electrical Control to limit AC installations to 300 volts. Brown's campaign to restrict AC to 300 volts went nowhere but legislation did come close to passing in Ohio and Virginia.[67]

Collusion with Edison
What brought Brown to the forefront of the debate over AC and his motives remain unclear,[58] but historians note there grew to be some form of collusion between the Edison company and Brown.[58][68] Edison records seem to show it was Edison Electric Light treasurer Francis S. Hastings who came up with the idea of using Brown and several New York physicians to attack Westinghouse and the other AC companies in retaliation for what Hastings thought were unscrupulous bids by Westinghouse for lighting contracts in Denver and Minneapolis.[67] Hasting brought Brown and Edison together[63] and was in continual contact with Brown.[67] Edison Electric seemed to be footing the bill for some of Brown's publications on the dangers of AC[69]. In addition, Thomas Edison himself sent a letter to the city government of Scranton, Pennsylvania recommending Brown as an expert on the dangers of AC.[66] Some of this collusion was exposed in letters stolen from Brown's office and published in August 1889.

The problem with this is that there's a good chance that the manager he's referring to isn't actually Edison but someone else in the company.

""Brown, determined to prove alternating current was more dangerous than direct current, at some point contacted Thomas Edison to see if he could make use of equipment to conduct experiments.[\[fn 2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_currents#cite_note-65) Edison immediately offered to assist Brown in his crusade against AC companies. Before long, Brown was loaned space and equipment at Edison's West Orange, New Jersey laboratory, as well as laboratory assistant [Arthur Kennelly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Kennelly).

Brown paid local children to collect stray dogs off the street for his experiments with direct and alternating current.[\[64\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_currents#cite_note-FOOTNOTEJonnes2003173-66) After much experimentation killing a series of dogs, Brown held a public demonstration on July 30 in a lecture room at [Columbia College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University).[\[65\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_currents#cite_note-FOOTNOTERockman2004469-67) With many participants shouting for the demonstration to stop and others walking out, Brown subjected a caged dog to several shocks with increasing levels of direct current up to 1000 volts, which the dog survived. Brown then applied 330 volts of alternating current which killed the dog. Four days later he held a second demonstration to answer critics' claims that the DC probably weakened the dog before it died. In this second demonstration, three dogs were killed in quick succession with 300 volts of AC.[\[66\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_currents#cite_note-FOOTNOTEJonnes2003174-68) Brown wrote to a college that he was sure this demonstration would get the New York Board of Electrical Control to limit AC installations to 300 volts. Brown's campaign to restrict AC to 300 volts went nowhere but legislation did come close to passing in Ohio and Virginia.[\[67\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_currents#cite_note-Carlson2003,285-69)""

On October 11, 1889 John Feeks, a Western Union lineman, was high up in the tangle of overhead electrical wires working on what were supposed to be low-voltage telegraph lines in a busy Manhattan district. As the lunchtime crowd below looked on he grabbed a nearby line that, unknown to him, had been shorted many blocks away with a high-voltage AC line. The jolt entered through his bare right hand and exited his left steel studded climbing boot. Feeks was killed almost instantly, his body falling into the tangle of wire, sparking, burning, and smoldering for the better part of an hour while a horrified crowd of thousands gathered below.""

Yes, we use AC and the way it's used is much more dangerous than Edison's DC system. Why? Because of the voltages. Edison used low voltage (nominal 110 volts) while AC is distributed at many thousands of volts. It's the efficiency of high-voltage transmission that give AC its advantage over DC for power distribution. ;1;1;False;2old2care;e0s6ame;Bitcoin?

"Neither is ""safer,"" they are simply utilized in the scenarios that they are because of the laws of physics.

AC currents are able to be sent over longer distances as they create less heat through the property of electrical resistance than a DC current would.  To use cables as an metaphor, AC currents are like an Ethernet cable that can go hundreds of feet before needing a repeater.  DC is like a USB cable that can go maybe 20 ft.  This is why we get our power in AC; it is much more efficient over significant distances.  How far away is your nearest transformer?  How about the power plant itself?  DC was never going to be the standard for power delivery to the home.

DC currents are used in electronics because, well, that's the only way the gates and transistors will function as intended.  If you can make a fully functioning computer operate on an AC current you would probably make a shit-load of money as you will have made power bricks (aka AC-DC converters) functionally obsolete.

The founders included cartoonist James Albert Wales, dime novels publisher Frank Tousey and author George H. Jessop. Under the editorial leadership of Isaac Gregory, 1886–1901, Judge allied with the Republican Party and supported the candidacy of William McKinley largely through the cartoons of cartoonists Victor Gillam and Grant E. Hamilton. Circulation for Judge was about 85,000 in the 1890s. By the 1900s, the magazine had become successful, reaching a circulation of 100,000 by 1912.)

"**War of the currents**

The war of the currents (sometimes called battle of the currents) was a series of events surrounding the introduction of competing electric power transmission systems in the late 1880s and early 1890s. It included commercial competition, a debate over electrical safety, and a media/propaganda campaign that grew out of it, with the main players being the direct current (DC)–based Edison Electric Light Company and the alternating current (AC)–based Westinghouse Electric Company. It took place during the introduction and rapid expansion of the alternating current standard (already in use and advocated by several US and European companies) and its eventual adoption over the direct current distribution system. Three aspects have been conflated into the ""war"": open competition involving large electric companies and a format war involving their developing systems, a general fear in the public's mind of death by accidental electrocution from high voltage AC leading to a debate over its safety and regulation, and the debate and behind-the-scene maneuvers associated with the introduction of the electric chair.

"My point is you are *creating* wallets, not restoring them... I can put 12 words right here right now, as long as they are valid BIP39 words and match the checksum it will create a wallet for you with zero balance.

The last word is a checksum, seriously look up BIP39 because it’s all in there. Some won’t work, some will, but these wallets haven’t been ‘opened’ it’s just because the checksum is correct....;1;1;False;remoteradiostar;e0rw6fd;1 BTC is hidden in this puzzle.

"You have a fundamental misunderstanding of how BIP39 works, it creates deterministic wallets... the seed words create a private key. You can go [here](https://iancoleman.io/bip39/?) and just click 'generate' and it will generate you random, correct seed words that you can then import into whatever you want (blockchain.info, your own wallet, whatever) and it will show you *zero balance* because no-one has generated your seedwords before.

A wallet is never 'opened' or 'closed' it literally just gives you a private key. Any BIP39 words can generate you a private key as long as the checksum is correct (which is why it will tell you some are wrong)

Any Bitcoin wallet has *no idea* if the wallet has been used before, just generated or whatever. All the words give you is *a private key*

OP has not created 60+ wallets, you aren't restoring OP's wallets, you're just getting private keys that may or may not have been used/generated before.";3;1;False;remoteradiostar;e0rg2vb;1 BTC is hidden in this puzzle. Good luck!;8kk0pa;https://i.redd.it/g4rbvtbiwry01.png

I use it: https://blockchain.info/en/wallet/#/help it is not possible to open a new wallet.
