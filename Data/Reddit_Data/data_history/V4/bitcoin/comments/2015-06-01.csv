"Part 1/2 (part 2 of 2 will be posted in 9 minutes, I'm limit restricted).

>You go from saying there is no morality to stating that morality is created by joining a social contract: ""Because the society / State has created the moral framework based on the views of its individual members.""

There is no objective morality. There is subjective, or context based morality.

>You cannot create morality. This is entirely meaningless

Sure you can create morality; or rather, groups can. What is normative or moral behavior changes over time and with context.

This is basic moral relativism, for example, societies which practice cannibalism.

>A contract (as stated under common law and the law of this land)

Oh god. I know where this is going. Getting into this as a discussion of contract law is getting into the weeds and irrelevant, because contract law is more or less a creation of the society which you are a part of.

In order to receive the protections of contract law, you must be a participant to the social contract. If you claim you are not a participant to the social contract, then you have no ""rights"" or ""protections"" and can be treated as an outsider/foreigner and are only subject to the restrictions of the State of Nature, which are none.

You can either accept the social contract, or we are allowed to kill you / remove you / do what we want with you. (Interestingly, a country like Germany actually requires the respect for all human beings as part of its Constitution, the US, does not, and only grants rights to US citizens, and those who are inside it).

>requires an offer, acceptance, and consideration. Also, contracts of great importance including those that last greater than a year also must be written under the Statute of Frauds (which has been incorporated generally into the Common Law)

>Where is this contract? What are its terms? ""I've never received an offer from my rulers, so I certainly have not accepted one; and rather than consideration, I have received nothing but contempt from the rulers, who, notwithstanding the absence of any agreement, have indubitably threatened me with grave harm in the event that I fail to comply with their edicts""

This is a bad argument. Your parents granted your consent through proxy. You have already received the social and cultural benefits, such as access to food, water, protection from foreign entities, an education, etc... Since the contract is, in essence, continually renewed by your continued presence and in the case of societies which allow you to leave, you can terminate the contract whenever you like, the Statue of Frauds is irrelevant.

If you want to trace this back to the point at which the US Government was formed by the Constitutional Congress, yes, some people then were told they could accept the contract, they could fight to oppose it (ie fight for the British or something else), or they can leave.

There is nothing wrong with being presented this choice.

>Also, how can children enter this social contract and be obligated to its terms when they are forcibly prevented from entering into express agreements themselves? Where does this obligation arise?

Stop using the word obligation. You are not required to take any action. You are offered a choice with different outcomes. Some of these outcomes might be favorable. Some might be unfavorable. It is up to you. In the state of nature, there is no right not to be threatened. It is only once you come under the protection of a society which you have such a socially protected right.

Children's choices are made for them by their parents, they can sue for emancipation within the system, and then they could renounce. They can also renounce at the age of majority.

In essence, the same way you inherit property from your parents, you inherit their agreement to the social contract.

>“And yet we have what purports, or professes, or is claimed, to be a contract—the Constitution—made eighty years ago, by men who are now all dead, and who never had any power to bind us, but which (it is claimed) has nevertheless bound three generations of men, consisting of many millions, and which (it is claimed) will be binding upon all the millions that are to come; but which nobody ever signed, sealed, delivered, witnessed, or acknowledged; and which few persons, compared with the whole number that are claimed to be bound by it, have ever read, or even seen, or ever will read, or see.”

So what? All of these requirements and protections are social requirements which require you to agree to the social contract.

You cannot raise any of these objections without first saying you have agreed to the contract, that it covers you, at which point these objections disappear.

If you make these objections in the State of Nature, I just laugh at you and say so what, and if I have more guys than you or better weapons, then I kill you if you fight.

>So morality is determined by government dictate?

More or less. It's a bit more complex because it is not just the Government, but social norms as well. For example, the government doesn't discuss certain issues, but society as a whole will have an opinion on them.

> Is it like god?

It's interesting that you bring up the idea of God. All concepts of natural law require a Judeo-Christian God. Natural rights come from the idea that man is created in God's images, and there is a superior authority which grants us rights and which to infringe on these rights would be an attempt to infringe upon God's rights. This is in essence the core statement of the Declaration of Independence. 

It was necessary because the governing framework was based, more-or-less, on the Divine Right of Kings.

The Constitution, however, signaled a departure from the authority of God in the natural world, to the authority of man (or collections of men). Nothing is restricted should enough people agree upon it, and authority to rule is not derived from God but from the People.

So in some senses, it is in fact a replacement for God.

>Also if society says something is good/bad, it makes it so?

More or less, yes.

>If we are society, did the slaves agree to forced labor? Did the jews commit suicide?

No, because you used the word ""if we are the society"" and our society abhors these practices. You're only looking at these practices as wrong because of your position and education in our society.

Frankly, if you were raised as a white male slave owner in the South in the 1700s / 1800s, you would likely not have any objection to slavery, unless you attended University in the North.

Similarly, if you were raised as a Hitler Youth, you would not think the Nazi's actions were wrong.

It's not that one entity agreed to their labor or committed suicide, its that you would be unlikely to see anything ""wrong"" about the action.

To develop an individual view that certain actions like those are unequivocally wrong requires a lot of thought, and a lot of information— usually stemming from a concept of mutualism (being able to see part of yourself in another being and not wanting  something done to you, so you would not do it to them). This is in essence the underpinnings of a logically coherent social contract.

Remember, not all social contracts are logically coherent; in fact, that is why the US Constitution represented such a massive step forward. It is perhaps the first internally consistent and morally sound social contract (though there are some arguments to be had about Greek and Roman social contracts).

>To take someone else must first have it. You are begging the question - a logical fallacy.

No. You've simply misunderstood. In the State of Nature, all beings have either equal claim or no claim to the entirety of the physical universe. You have no greater right to a particular tree or cave or water, than I do. You have the ability to utilize it, or claim it for yourself, but there's no right and I don't need to respect your use of it. When you assert that this is ""your tree"" or ""your cave"" you deprive me of my ability to use it for my own devices, and taken that from me.

>Further, everyone would be dead because the act of eating or drinking would be taking away the right to those resources.

No. It's just an admission that it is impossible to live without committing acts of aggression toward other creatures. It is a fundamental component of our natural, resource constrained universe.

If you attempted to live by the non-aggression principle, yes, you would die. 

>Where does this supposed right come from by the way?

It's not a right. There are natural abilities. I.e. that which I can do.

>Now you say a right of access, which is different from the above. Again, where does this right come from (in light of you claiming their is no morality)

Again, it's not a right. It's a statement of fact. I physically can access it, just as any other creature can. If you stop me from doing so you have committed an act of aggression toward me and interfered with me.

"> Because forcefully taking over an area and claiming that the inhabitants are obligated to give them money is inherently hypocritical and unsound in its reasoning.

Obligation is a weird word to use here. You used it in your initial question, and I think we should stop using it. You'll note my response did not use the word at all, because I'm not talking about obligations.

Please explain what you see as hypocritical and what is unsound. Any claim to any property is forcefully taking something from someone else.

It may be ""mean"" or ""ruthless"" or something like that, but its not inherently unsound or hypocritical.

>Obviously you do by stating that they must leave or be obligated to give them money. You have proven no basis on which they have such an obligation.

I'm saying there is no obligation on anyone's part. The ""obligation"" to pay ""protection money"" or ""taxes"" is only that they might be beaten up or thrown in jail. It's not an obligation so much as a choice between potential outcomes. You can do whatever you want.

The word is helpful to your argument because it shapes the discussion in an emotional and moral framework which makes people have a certain reaction, but it isn't actually persuasive.

>'Voluntarily' is not being used in its normal meaning here.

Yes it is, but it was a bit redundant. I could have just said ""accept it.""

>Does a cashier voluntarily give money to a robber at gunpoint? In a certain sense yes, they do; in that they can direct the actions of their body, yet in another they are not since it is being done under duress.

That doesn't mean its not a normal use of the word; this distinction isn't really all that relevant.

We can boil this down to the idea: do we have a right not to be threatened?

In the State of Nature, of course not. We only have a right not to be threatened when we join a society and mutually agree not to threaten each other.

>According to the State's own terms, it is guilty of extortion, conversion, assault, kidnapping, and murder; yet it grants itself immunity from such actions.

No. It is only extortion, conversion, assault, kidnapping, and murder when a private entity does it. Look at the statutes. These actions are only wrong / bad because the State (society) says they're wrong / bad, so it gets to define when and how these actions are wrong.

>Let's assume for argument's sake that their is no morality. In that instance, there is still no obligation on the population's part to leave. There is entirely no obligation to do anything whatsoever.

Right. That's what I said. That's why you can accept it, fight it, or leave. Those are the three possible paths I can see.

The problem is if you fight the mob or the government, you will likely lose. So people often choose not to fight and instead comply.

>Yet the state speaks in terms of morality and societal obligations.

Does it speak in terms of morality and societal obligations? I mean, societal obligations in the form of legal requirements sure, and perhaps individual politicians speak in moral terms, but I don't really know that I agree with your premise here. But say it does speak in these terms. So what? The society / State has created the moral framework and societal obligations based on the views of its individual members. The contract we as a group agree to (roughly, the US Constitution plus some common law precedent) creates societal obligations and outlines what in many ways what is moral and immoral behavior for an individual, and then restricts the superior entity (the State) in what it can and cannot do to individuals and the world around it. This is a bit simplistic but it gets the idea across.

I feel like you think this creates a contradiction against something else but I don't see it.

Could you clarify so I can try to understand your opinion better?

>So if you view this from a moral basis or not, one MUST come to the conclusion that any claim on part of the state of the right to rule over others is false and has no basis in reason or evidence.

I don't feel you made an argument there. You went from A to X without stopping in between. Please clarify.

>Sorry bud. Every argument that you will attempt to promote is already dead in the water. It will just take some time for you to realize it.

Hah. It's sadly the opposite.


The ""legitimate"" authority of a State which allows it's citizens to opt out of the social contract and leave is contained within the idea of ""property."" (There is an argument to be made which States which do not allow you to opt out don't have a legitimate claim to authority.)

If you can have property, then a group can have property. All a State is, is a group of people exercising a property claim.

My gut is that you think the non-aggression principle can be reconciled with the idea of owning something; but the act of claiming an object as one's property destroys the idea of non-aggression. By claiming something as property, you have aggressed against the rest of the universe by restricting everyone else's natural ability to access and use that object.

This even applies to yourself and your person. By claiming self-ownership, you have aggressed against the universe and opened yourself to retaliation / cannot delegitimize the claims of the State. It is only if you abandon the concept of property, which you can claim a State exercising control is illegitimate, and then you don't have self-ownership anyway. So either, self-ownership in the State of Nature and subordinated self in the State, or, no-self ownership under any conditions.

You need to defeat the argument ""if you don't like it, just leave"" and ultimately I've never seen a good response to this from any ancap anywhere.

"Part 2/2

>For a detailed discussion and refutation of all of these arguments please click here

I'm only going to address the first argument in your link, because without this argument everything else falls apart; and it fails.

>One way to prove self-ownership is by assessing three possibilities of who owns a person: that everyone in the world owns fractions of everyone else in the world, that some group of elites own everyone else, or that every person owns him or herself.

Except the three ""possibilities"" envisioned in the Universe specifically do not cover all of the possibilities, that there is no such thing as a natural right, that no one has a right to own anything, and that we only have the natural ability to exert and support a claim, and no one owns anything until one exerts a claim. See the issue? 

>The first such possibility is that everybody has an equal claim to ownership over everyone else.  Murray Rothbard (page 36) explained that this scenario

>“holds that every man should have the right to own his equal quotal share of everyone else. If there are two billion people in the world, then everyone has the right to own one two-billionth of every other person. In the first place, we can state that this ideal rests on an absurdity: proclaiming that every man is entitled to own a part of everyone else, yet is not entitled to own himself. Secondly, we can picture the viability of such a world: a world in which no man is free to take any action whatever without prior approval or indeed command by everyone else in society. It should be clear that in that sort of. . .  world, no one would be able to do anything, and the human race would quickly perish.”

>Thus, we are able to reject any notion that people can be co-owners of each other. Seeing that it is impossible for humans to all own equal shares in each other, we must now examine the notion that one group of people owns all of the rest of the people (page 28).

I destroyed the argument with one sentence above, but this statement by the way, isn't even a refutation of the idea that we might all own small fractions of eachother or things. It claims 1) that the idea is absurd, which is not an actual logical refuation of the idea, and 2) that it is not practical or viable, which is also not a refutation of the idea.

This is simply bad logic and is contained throughout the works of people like Rothbard and Van Mises. It's why I roll my eyes whenever I hear someone is a Libertarian or Ancap.

>You or I as a property owner cannot steal from, assault, imprison, or murder people who happen to be on our property. 

Only because our social contract says we may not. In the State of Nature I certainly can. And that's not even true in all parts of the US.

>A property owner only has the right of exclusive use. He or she can only expel others from the property, nothing further.

A limited right of exclusive use as defined by the property laws enacted by Congress, supported by the Constitution and its inclusion of Common Law through the practice of Judicial Review.

>If a person comes onto your property, they are still not obligated to any rules that you dictate - they are simply trespassers.

Because we have a social contract. But in the state of nature, we can do whatever we want, so we form a social contract which exercises exclusivity over say, the territorial United States. And if an entity not a party to our social contract tried to fly over here without permission, we would probably kill them. That's what a failed invasion would look like.

>This is also assuming that the owner has a valid claim to property. The U.S. murdered the native populations and intentionally breached their treaties. So based on their own rules, they cannot be a legitimate owner.

What is wrong with the US killing off an indigenous population in order to establish itself?

Right of Conquest was a part of Common Law (pre-existing society) until about 1963. All of these acts occurred prior to 1963, have no conflict in the State of Nature, and had no conflict in the general ""laws of man"" at the time they were undertaken.

Based on its own rules it quite literally is the legitimate owner. This is a bad argument.

>You are making the positive statement; therefore, you have the burden of showing why I or anyone else has the obligation to do so.

I've never said you have the obligation to do so. I have said I have the ability to hurt you, kill you, tax you, imprison you, do whatever the fuck I want to you if you are not a party to our social contract because you don't get those protections, and in the State of Nature the only thing stopping me would be if you are stronger than me; which is unlikely given in this case I have 300 million friends who will help me.

You are asserting that some part of this is ""wrong"" or ""hypocritical."" But you can't point out what part is wrong, and it is not hypocritical because my code of conduct, behavior, and ethics, only apply to those who also participate in the same social contract.

To those who do not, good luck.

>I guess through your reasoning, a mugger or rapist can't ever be wrong, the victims must like or leave the neighborhood.

In the State of Nature, if there is a mugger or rapist near you, you should either kill them or leave if you don't think you can kill them.

But the Universe does not care, and there is nothing intrinsically stopping them from mugging or raping you. The only defense is mutual defense through the creation of a social contract. You can argue that holding you in one against your will is wrong because it constitutes a violation of that contract, but we don't hold you in it.

>You are obviously fooled by government motives and ignorant to endemic corruption of a broken system driven by greed and willful exploitation of the masses. The US greed machine will undo the entire human race while people like you laugh all the way to the bank. That is my final reply.


>  You have your opinion but I think you think you have some kind of moral high ground. 

No, I just have the logical high ground. Or the high ground of being right.

>you believe in control and conformity.

I believe we all consent to a substantial amount of control and conformity in order to receive a variety of benefits. I think this is an observation of reality, rather than a belief.

>You spit the same political rhetoric of the sociopathic politicians that busily stuff their pockets with lobby money.

That's not an argument against my rhetoric. It's an argument that perhaps we should look into political corruption.

Also, generally, one needs to be a bit sociopathic to be a politician. If you make decisions with empathy or emotion, you likely make bad decisions which do not benefit the larger whole.

>You are obviously fooled by government motives and ignorant to endemic corruption of a broken system driven by greed and willful exploitation of the masses.

Nope. I agree with government motives, and while there is some corruption, I don't think its a priority and I don't see a better or more viable system. We can certainly do more to prosecute and ferret it out, but it is not intrinsic to our societal structure. We were doing very well in the 50s-70s, but the rampant inequality of the last 30-40 years is very concerning.

>The US greed machine will undo the entire human race while people like you laugh all the way to the bank.

Actually, the US greed machine will likely be what saves the human race; though we do need to reign in socioeconomic inequality before it becomes destabilizing.

And yes, I will laugh all the way to the bank.

You can believe in freedom all you want, but freedom only exists in the State of Nature. If you want that, that's fine, but the State of Nature is a miserable and ugly place where there is nothing to stop others from mugging, raping, killing, doing whatever they want to you simply because they are stronger than you.

Rather than focusing on being as strong as possible to survive, I'd like to participate in an abstract and complex society where I can translate doing weird things like making films into money which I can then transform into food and shelter for me and my family, and which I really don't have to think about being attacked by animals or other human beings.

I want these benefits. I love these benefits. If you see that as believing in control, so be it.

But I don't think you realize how shitty and miserable life would be if we gave up our society, and I don't think you realize that modern societies like the US already are the ""voluntary"" associations Libertarians and Ancaps lionize.

I simply don't believe you want the world you claim you want.

"> Again with lawyer speak. As soon as you say 'statement' you look like you think this is a court. This is not a court. There is no need to pick this apart with semantics.

I am not picking apart with semantics and accusing me of speaking as though I am in court is a completely meaningless. It's subjective on your part, is a matter of style, and is in no way relevant to anything under discussion. I'm trying to articulate my points clearly because I know others are likely to disagree with them.

You did not give a reason for why and how facilitating drug sales is fundamentally different than importing them. I pointed that out.

You made a claim, and then made a bad analogy. I pointed out that you should have made a claim, explained your logic, and then made a structurally sound analogy if you so liked.

>Just as setting up a website where people sell goods to each other anonymously is not illegal.

Actually, it very well could be. There are a huge number of Federal Laws governing interstate commerce, and while you could claim that you did not know X was being sold illegally on your site for some violations, not only are their other violations which don't require knowledge / intent (rather, there is a legal obligation to Know Your Customer), but in the case of Silk Road, it is very clear the owner operator knew what they were selling, recruited sellers, etc...

Additionally, when you take a commission of a sale, you are for all intents and purposes treated as the seller.

Uber's trying this argument all over the place and losing; it simply doesn't fly.

>I have every right to buy things without the government knowing so long as they are legal.

I actually don't know that I agree with this. Why do you believe you have this right?

More so, answer this: does the government have the right to find out about a legal purchase if it gets a warrant?

This is one of the issues with Bitcoin / Tor / anonymous transactions, etc...

If the government has a warrant and follows due process, it has the right to know everything about you. To me, that's part of our social contract.

>In the same way, if I buy illegal drugs at a bar, the bar is not to blame. I am.

It depends. For example, there was a motel that was often used for drug deals and prostitution. The Police were repeatedly called to it, repeatedly busted people. It was suspected that the owners encouraged the activity, but they weren't able to prove it. Eventually, they lawfully shut down the entire hotel because even if the owners did not know, they should have known. Wilful disregard is a thing.

>You are arguing with everyone. Over and over. In favour of the life sentence. Despite being overwhelmingly disagreed with. Why?

Because its better for one person to be right and everyone else be wrong, than for everyone to be wrong.

r/bitcoin is a very insular community consisting largely of Libertarians and Ancaps, two similar but ideologically incoherent world views.

If I can get even one person to look at their position and rethink their assumptions, then its worth it.

I already have in the past, so I continue to now.

Why do you think a lot of people disagreeing with me would somehow be something I care about?

You yourself said I make solid arguments.

The world in general appears to agree with me; our society just sentenced him to life in prison.

You really should go take a look at some of the Wired articles on him, especially the transcripts of his chats recruiting potential new sellers, and ordering hits.
