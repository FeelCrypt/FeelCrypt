"The problem with generalizations ascribed to large groups of people is that you can never substantiate them without making an ad populum fallacy. Who cares what ""most people"" thought if they weren't right?

and so... ""The sentiment amongst the crypto community"" is fluff BS.

The bit i responded to was ""insider trading in crypto."" This is VERY MUCH a problem of centralization. Coinbase is centralized, thus insider trading in crypto is an issue.

The people bitching about insider trading don't give a shit about your apparent ""crypto community."" 

They care when centralizing forces are supported (by unprovable entities, gov? early whales?) and then take advantage of their position.

The bottomline is you cannot have a decentralized exchange that deals with fiat without some sort of API blessing/token that banks provide. That's it. At that moment, there would literally be no such thing as an entity that will ""buy bitcoins for / from you."" You'd just fluidly exchange between whatever database line item you wanted to. $/DOGE/BTC/etc.


In short, my point is that coinbase IS centralized AND regulated and if they're going to dick around on both sides of the fence they shouldn't be surprised when they're pushed out of one side or trapped on the other.

U.S. laws don't necessarily apply to Chinese exchanges, unless the exchange agrees to abide by them for one or more reasons (such as to comply with U.S. regulations). They could've handled it in a number of ways, arguably better or worse. Take for example what BitFinex did when their users lost their money - they didn't credit them in USD, they created a new coin and credited them in that. Or what Bitconnect did - they didn't credit their users in USD, they credited them with worthless BCC.;0;2;False;cembry90;dvc6yyb;Now We Know Who Sold the Bottom at $6k And Tried To Crash Bitcoin - Spoiler alert: it was Mt.Gox trustee;82p0o2;https://captainaltcoin.com/now-we-know-who-sold-the-bottom-at-6k-and-tried-to-crash-bitcoin/

"Long story short there was this old site, Magic The Gathering Online Exchange, that was rebranded into a Bitcoin exchange; they named it Mt. Gox for short. For a long time, before the exchange went under, concerns grew that the exchange was insolvent; that if everyone wanted to withdraw their money at one time, they didn't actually have enough Bitcoin to allow that. Then one day, Mt. Gox came out and said they got hacked. The site shut down, it went to court, and people submitted claims to get their money back.

 

Flash forward to today, and the trustee appointed with recovering enough USD funds to repay all of the Mt. Gox customers. He's been selling Bitcoin in large amounts at one time - 6,000 BTC on December 22nd, 8,000 BTC on January 17th, 6,000 BTC on January 31st, 6,000 BTC on February 6th. Each of the times these Bitcoin were sold, the price of Bitcoin dropped thousands of dollars.

 

The fear, and why people are concerned about this, is that the previous transactions are only 26,000 BTC out of some 200,000 BTC that were stolen. Current estimates are that there are still somewhere in the range of 180,000 BTC that the trustee is in possession of, waiting to be sold; the concern is that if the price of BTC has fallen as far as it has with just a fraction of the overall BTC that were stolen being sold, how much farther can/will it fall if the selling continues?";76;3;False;cembry90;dvc5cbi;Now We Know Who Sold the Bottom at $6k And Tried To Crash Bitcoin - Spoiler alert: it was Mt.Gox trustee;82p0o2;https://captainaltcoin.com/now-we-know-who-sold-the-bottom-at-6k-and-tried-to-crash-bitcoin/
Fair enough, then just prorate their original USD value in terms of the current value of BTC so that if the customer is then able to decide what they want to do in case the value of BTC increases (or decreases). At least we won't see the market plummet as much, provided some of the customers will want to retain their BTC.;5;0;False;cembry90;dvc2jyw;Now We Know Who Sold the Bottom at $6k And Tried To Crash Bitcoin - Spoiler alert: it was Mt.Gox trustee;82p0o2;https://captainaltcoin.com/now-we-know-who-sold-the-bottom-at-6k-and-tried-to-crash-bitcoin/
I have no clue how the Japanese legal system says this should be done, but what will happen to any coins left after enough have been sold to cover everyone's USD equivalent balance?

what happened was something called Slippage. they sold at a high price, but such a large quantity, that it actually affected the price (negatively). it ate up all the order book entries down. this caused a panic and made the price drive down even more. basically its the opposite of a pump. and btc is very hard to pump due to the value and volume required. so u can imagine the amounts they were selling.;2;2;False;phish73;dvc1svy;Now We Know Who Sold the Bottom at $6k And Tried To Crash Bitcoin - Spoiler alert: it was Mt.Gox trustee;82p0o2;https://captainaltcoin.com/now-we-know-who-sold-the-bottom-at-6k-and-tried-to-crash-bitcoin/

"Wayyyy too many assumptions required to make this statement true. 

I think you’re assuming you’re the only seller/buyer in the market at a given time and that there is unlimited demand on the other side of your trade at the current price. These assumptions won’t ever hold up in the real world. You’re not the only person selling or buying at any given time and the demand for each unit of currency at a given price has limits. 

Your coins are only as valuable as what the next person will pay for them. Price would most likely go down after you begin selling your first coin. So you’d be selling each successive coin (or satoshi, the smallest unit of bitcoin) for a lower price than the previous until such point as you run out of coins to sell. At that point you would be able to begin buying again, and you’d be buying them as price increases due to your buying causing price to rise. In the end, assuming no external factors, you’d end up exactly where you started, minus any transaction fees you laid out to get there.

"This is such a simplistic analysis which demonstrates, to anyone with some real understanding of the markets, that you don't know what you're talking about.

>Sell 10 million USD in actual coins at 12k.

You are assuming the market can absorb $10m at $12k... it can't, there's slippage all over the place. Start selling @ $12k, end selling at $10k is MUCH more likely. 

Hint: Check any real life orderbook. I looked at Bitstamp right now, you wanna get $10m, you'll need to sell ~1,000BTC. Price ~$9,700... to get to 1,000 BTC you need to get to a price of ~$9,100/ And that assumes *the order book doesn't change during your dump*. It will, bots will pile in on the trade to push down with, stop losses will get triggered and then some. If you end the trade, i.e. last BTC sold @ ~8,500 you're lucky. So you won't get $10m.

>Use 10 million in BTC to short 50 million on margin.

You cannot. CME margin requirements are pretty brutal, see [here](http://www.cmegroup.com/education/cme-bitcoin-futures-frequently-asked-questions.html) Basically you'll initiate a short of another ~800 BTC, as the initial margin for a speculator, which is what you are, is 110% and you DON'T have $10m, as noted above. And again you'll incur in dramatic slippage, on the futures this time, your average sell price will likely be ~$7,500 or so.

At this point the price will be, say, $7,000. But you don't have any extra money in your account! Settlement is daily, so you still only have the proceeds from the previous sale. And now you need to unwind your short futures position. Means you need to start BUYING to be **flat** on the futures. Will the market keep crashing? That's anybody's guess. It might. Or it might not. Remember November, when Novogratz came in and bought $20m @ ~$5,500? Roger and the rest of the BCash gang didn't plan for another whale playing... and neither are you. What is sure is that *you will incur additional slippage on your buy back*! And once you're done buying the futures back, that's when you have to start buying the BTC back. Slippage anyone?

&nbsp;

Bottom line... it doesn't work. Slippage will eat you alive, which you'll incur 4 times (!!!), and trade fees will help with that. So yeah, not gonna work. Certainly not without taking a significant amount of risk. Which means... it's a gamble. Be my guest. 

/u/i_gotta_say, you're right... if it was so easy, it'd be happening all the time. It's not.

"It’s a moot point. The court did not ask for, nor did it need, anyone to agree to the damages being calculated in fiat. That’s just how the process works. Losses are calculated, in fiat, at the time the court orders the entity liquidated, and the trustee attempts to (generally speaking) get back as many assets as possible, convert them to fiat, and give them back to creditors.

Agreeing to the process is implicit in living there (this happened in Japan), same as following any other rule of law. 

This article gives a decent overview of what happened https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/bitcoin-gox/

In this case, the trustee has recovered property (bitcoin) that appreciated in value after the liquidation. It does not mean the damages should increase. Similarly, if you had 10k worth of bitcoin back then and the value had gone down by half afterwards, you wouldn’t be willing to just take 5k because that’s the current value of the property. You’d want your 10k. 

I realize the opportunity cost here is very high. These folks haven’t been given back crypto or fiat and years have passed. Assuming they had that fiat sooner and reinvested it in crypto they would be much richer.

I know there’s plenty of bots, but apart from that I’m sure there are plenty of people that have gotten involved in crypto without taking the time to educate themselves. I think we forget that because we spend a lot of our time on reddit where we at the very least know to hold. I have friends that got into crypto in the last few months when bitcoin was on the elevator up to $20k, bought bitcoin and altcoins at the top, and then sold at the bottom despite my advice to hold.

This is what lack of regulation brings...the trustee can share his plans and schedule to sell with his hedge fund buddies who then go short on the futures market, likely spread on a variety of shorting vehicles (exchanges, CBOE, CME..LedgerX...) as to not tip their hand and then BAM instant profits.  Normally that would be illegal but without regulation, anything’s doable.  This to me is the single biggest threat to Bitcoin today, not FUD but fraud.  Too many people sitting on 100k+ coins that have incentive to be bad actor and personally profit.  From the Mt Gox trustee to Roger Ver and Gavin Ayre....and done correctly they never really have to spread their holdings, they can rinse and repeat forever.  ;16;1;False;bitradr;dvbtdnw;Now We Know Who Sold the Bottom at $6k And Tried To Crash Bitcoin - Spoiler alert: it was Mt.Gox trustee;82p0o2;https://captainaltcoin.com/now-we-know-who-sold-the-bottom-at-6k-and-tried-to-crash-bitcoin/

Most creditors want the remaining BTC, BCH and BTG to be divided up, but this can't be done in a bankruptcy under Japanese law. Our only hope is that the court agrees to civil rehabilitation. If this happens, we could get approximately 1/4th of a bitcoin for every bitcoin we had in MtGox.
