You seem to imply that more opportunities for education are causing people to learn the wrong things. Should we restrict what they can learn? Who gets to choose what is and isn't allowed?;1;0;False;;ekfueuo;Carl Sagan's Prophecy From 1995 Is Scary Accurate;bajfbs;https://i.redd.it/xbe1kimgyvq21.jpg

"An enormous amount of taxes that most citizens pay to their government are used to pay interest on the national debt. When a nation finally eliminates it's debt to central banks, there will no longer be enormous interest payments to make, and expenditures will be vastly lower which should/will result in lower taxes for citizens.

A government without debt could operate with the same or an even greater level efficiency and public service with far lower taxes on it's citizens.

Maybe start with Reddit and actually read the article vs the headline and tell me this is not  biased. All Trump said was that the Dems would never be satisfied, then you get this outrage with all these upvotes and gold. https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/b8igkb/trump_erupts_over_congress_demand_for_mueller/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share;1;0;False;SerRovert;ekfenmp;Carl Sagan's Prophecy From 1995 Is Scary Accurate;bajfbs;https://i.redd.it/xbe1kimgyvq21.jpg

To be fair most people in crypto still think of it as a get rich quick scheme. I mean how many people bought at 20k then sold at 10k only to never re-enter the market. Now, I am overjoyed to search for an unbelievable crypto [casino](https://vegascasino.io/casino/video-slots/crazy-bananas?utm_source=cccb) where you'll find a constant stream of bonuses/promotions and also offers multiple traditional table games and slots plus they also offer fantastic five- and six-figure Bitcoin prizes right now but I think all the people who are still here have known for a while that this is what the market looks like when you zoom out. Everyone else is gone and will once again fomo back in at the next ATH.;2;0;False;MochaWithSugar;ekg9smw;Good to see you again;b8ek6w;https://i.redd.it/owozm3bi6sp21.gif
