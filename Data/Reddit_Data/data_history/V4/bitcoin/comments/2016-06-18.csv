">But blocks aren't guaranteed to any given miner. How do you give the money to the right guy? What if another miner mines it first?

They are guaranteed a given miner if only that miner has the document. Imagine taking your will to a notary: you pay them then and there to notarize it (and they are contractually obliged to follow through). You have no incentive to take your will to another notary (and if you did anyway, you'd just pay the other one too - the full amount).

And presumably your contract with each of these notaries would specify that if another notary notarizes your document before them (you've double-spent your will), then they get to keep the fee you paid them and are released from the obligation to ""mine"" your will.

But air *is* ""scarce"" - just not in a practically relevant sense. Just like bitcoin won't be ""scarce"" if bitcoin-small-b fails.

"> That's the part where I disagree, and why I say Bitcoin (the network, not bitcoin the unit of account) does have intrinsic value. You could imagine a world where people would be willing to pay miners directly in USD (for example) for the service of mining a block.

But blocks aren't guaranteed to any given miner.  How do you give the money to the right guy?  What if another miner mines it first?

> What is the price of air

I knew I would miss one reference to scarcity in one spot and you'd nail me for it.  You'll notice in other references to value and price I include scarcity.

You have no incentive to take your will to another notary (and if you did anyway, you'd just pay the other one too - the full amount).

But when you go to the notary, they notarize and you're done.  You go to a miner, they offer to notarize and then don't find a block for a few hours because other miners are notarizing other blocks.  That'd be a highly inefficient version of a notary.

But again, you're reaching here.  Air is not scarce; it is being constantly renewed, as fast or faster than we can consume it.

Fine, if you care to be so pedantic, then we can say ""capped supply"" as in, no more can be created.";1;0;False;manWhoHasNoName;d4e9d5k;Bitcoin has sustained a 25% rise for more than a week now and yet no post here has reached /all.
