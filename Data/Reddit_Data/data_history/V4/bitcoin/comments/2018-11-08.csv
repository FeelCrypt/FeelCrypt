"Even in the poorest countries there is a middle class. People that work hard and do everything right. Those people are still able to have maybe $10-$50k in savings. 

Keep in mind, if these people had grown up Americans, they'd be the kind of middle class family that has $100k plus by the time they are 40 years old due to them working hard and saving when possible.

Anyways, these people do almost everything right yet they cant control the economy so eventually they decide okay, let's take our life savings and get the hell out. The poorest of the poor in these countries are the ones that never even try to leave.

An interesting thing also is that a lot of voluntary  immigrants you see from China, Middle East, India, etc are not the poorest of the poor. A lot are families that could afford to relocate and decided they'd rather be poor Americans than middle class Indians or etc.

Obviously these are generalizations and not everyone has savings and not every one coming here is middle class. Some are poor and some are rich as well. But that's my experience.

"if you do that you're putting your wealth in the hands of foreign companies. if you are carrying your family wealth in crypto this is not recommended imho. I'm not sure what to recommend... maybe they can force you to unlock you email and ask what is that file.

maybe encrypt the seed with a pgp key and blend it with steganography to a cat picture (photo made by yourself). upload the cat pic to multiple clouds and hard drives. send the cat picture to trusted friends via chat apps. delete original.

do the same for the encrypted private pgp you used to encrypt. 

memorize the password that unlocks the pgp key. cross the airport with the password in your head and cat pictures on your devices. now it depends on the capability of your gov to guess you have used steganography.

if using this method always after crossing the controls at airports of the oppressed country, etc you decrypt everything and send everything to a new wallet.

encryption and decryption happens only in secure laptops disconnected from the internet at all times using a live OS. only the cat picture with the encrypted seed touches the internet.

do not rely on this, do your own research.
