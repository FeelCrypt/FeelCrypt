Go to kayak.com.  A flight oct 14, returning oct 20, Boston to Paris, is $873 on Aer Lingus.

"Except that we have a airport that monitors all planes over the area, and is regulated by the BLM & FAA. Its called 88NV

Also, its worth noting that if you can afford to parachute in, you can probably afford a ticket, and that way you could at the least have a tent and some water. those are nice things to have out there.

"It's not nice to call people names. If I'm wrong, explain it. I don't think I am. Show me a flight that costs that little. 

I checked on Expedia for flights from Boston to France and I'm finding $2500 and up. Maybe you can snag a ticket for as low as $800 if you have the know how.. 
In any case I was approaching the concept as a *trip* to Europe costing $800 (a one way ticket isn't going to be very useful for someone looking for a way to have fun for a week), vs going to Burning Man.
