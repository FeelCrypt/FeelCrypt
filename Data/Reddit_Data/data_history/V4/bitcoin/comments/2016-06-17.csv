What is the intrinsic value of bitcoin over any other altcoin? Ultimately, bitcoin is just a *cryptocurrency* and a currency only has intrinsic value if people use it to exchange goods and services.

If you ever take any classes on finance, you'll learn that proper investing isn't about picking stocks, [financial theory](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capm.asp) says that you should try and invest in the [market portfolio](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/market-portfolio.asp). Now obviously the market portfolio is impossible to invest in, (you'd need to own one one millionth of your neighbors house, for example) but you should try and approximate it as much as possible. Approximating the market portfolio means you diversify as much as possible, which means you actually want as much uncorrelated volatility as possible. Bitcoin has low correlation to any other asset, so any investor obtains the [free-lunch of diversification](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/diversification.asp) by investing small amounts in volatile and uncorrelated assets such as bitcoin. ;4;1;False;SirReal14;d4cjd9u;Bitcoin has sustained a 25% rise for more than a week now and yet no post here has reached /all.

I don't think you mean it in the literal sense. USD does not have intrinsic value, it has relational value based on other people's opinion of the value. Unlike an ear of corn, which has nutritive value, or a house, which has value as shelter, money is a social construct. USD is based on trust (that other people will accept its value and that the US govt is viable to continue to require USD as legal tender into the future--a justified trust in this case, but failures of many national currencies in the past should indicate that currencies don't have fundamental intrinsic value and can devalue at any time a society decides they don't like it anymore). ;1;2;False;cuginhamer;d4cb0nk;Bitcoin has sustained a 25% rise for more than a week now and yet no post here has reached /all.

"But if that's the case, then they obviously value the bitcoin *at least* the amount of the electricity that it would cost to run it plus the time associated with setting up and maintaining it.  Some people would rather just buy the tokens from someone else (because specialization is a thing), and then you have value.

If a good isn't 100% completely easy and free to obtain, and there is demand for it (in any capacity), then it will always have *some* value to *someone*.  If no one wanted it, it couldn't even be used as a time-stamper because no one would want to mine it.  As soon as someone wanted it for a time-stamper, then someone would want it for *something*, and thus you've created value.

So I guess I'm trying to say is that it's paradoxical to say something has a use and no value.  You can't even perform the thought experiment because ""use"" of an object is a subset of its ""value"".  If its use in trade is zero, it's ""value"" set is the ""use"" set.  

[Here's an illustration](http://imgur.com/Wq0mKvM) if it helps.  The black circle with white fill is an item's value.  The red circle is an item's use.  If the value is solely in the use, then the red circle would completely fill the value circle.  So as long as there is a red circle (use) of larger than zero radius, then the black circle with white fill (value) will be *at least* that big.

So I guess, in the end, we're in agreement.  As long as it has use, it has value.";2;1;False;manWhoHasNoName;d4cki5o;Bitcoin has sustained a 25% rise for more than a week now and yet no post here has reached /all.

"I think I'm not explaining my thought process very well.

>So I guess I'm trying to say is that it's paradoxical to say something has a use and no value.

But that isn't the same as the *price*. In this thought experiment, what has value is the *blocks* (because of the timestamping service they provide), not the *tokens* mined. People may be willing to pay to put tokens into blocks, but they won't be willing to pay for the tokens themselves. The tokens may simply represent the existence of documents (proof-of-existence OP_RETURN type stuff); those tokens themselves have no value; what has value is that they are *known*.

"> But that isn't the same as the *price*.

Price is a function of value.  In general, there are two ways to obtain a good or service.  The first way is to do it yourself.  That way requires time and potentially money (electrical costs).  The second way is to pay someone else to do it.  The *price* is the amount people are willing to pay others to do it for them.

So the *blocks* have value.  How do you pay people to put the *blocks* together in a chain?  That's the *fee*, which is collected in *bitcoin* (the tokens).  So the miners are getting paid in *tokens*, which must have a value to the miners equal or greater to the time and money it takes to generate the blocks (or else they wouldn't do it).  Then, how do you obtain more tokens for insertion into the blocks?  Bitcoin has a fixed supply.  Currently coins can either be issued by mining (in exchange for time/money) or obtained from others.  The others who have the tokens, should they give them to you, either paid for those tokens or mined them (which took time/money).  Giving them up means they lose the good they spend time/money to obtain, so they require compensation.  The people who have tokens who bought them (to use as time-stampers) have created a price by buying them.  They won't give them up freely; they paid something for them.

So the point that I'm making is that you can't say the tokens have no value if you say they have value.  The tokens, should they have value and not be infinite in quantity, will automatically generate a price by the fact that people want them for their value.

You can't have a thought experiment where something of value has no price, because if something has value and it can not be freely obtained (like air), the only thing you need is one person offering to trade money for that something's use.

Establishing something has value and scarcity automatically implies it has a price.";1;1;False;manWhoHasNoName;d4cwm2x;Bitcoin has sustained a 25% rise for more than a week now and yet no post here has reached /all.

">So the blocks have value. How do you pay people to put the blocks together in a chain? That's the fee, which is collected in bitcoin

Nobody says a notary has to be paid in notarized documents. They can be paid in un-notarized pieces of paper with mugshots of long-dead guys on them.

>So the miners are getting paid in tokens, which must have a value to the miners equal or greater to the time and money it takes to generate the blocks (or else they wouldn't do it).

That's the part where I disagree, and why I say Bitcoin (the network, not bitcoin the unit of account) does have intrinsic value. You could imagine a world where people would be willing to pay miners directly in USD (for example) for the service of mining a block. The system's value needn't be valued directly in its own frame of reference. Those 25 or 12.5 or whatever bitcoins that the post-bitcoin-failure (little b) miners get as a reward would be entirely uninteresting to them.

Heck, you could imagine altcoins (if they don't already exist) whose PoW function is the destruction of bitcoins. This would be similar: the notary-miners would be destroying USD (mediated by electricity) that people pay them for their service.

>You can't have a thought experiment where something of value has no price

What is the price of air? Or of sea water? In my post-bitcoin-failure scenario, bitcoins would be just like air or sand or sea water: so plentiful that nobody cares, that it might as well be priced at zero and really the only thing you pay for is the service of putting the sand in bags or the air in pressurized cylinders.";1;1;False;bpj1805;d4czdjb;Bitcoin has sustained a 25% rise for more than a week now and yet no post here has reached /all.

"> corn, which has nutritive value, or a house, which has value as shelter, money is a social construct

I'd go further and see that even corn and houses have values that are different to different people, and are thus not *intrinsic* at all.  In fact, value is not about anything within a good or service, but about what people are willing to give away in order to obtain it.  For instance, I have a house, so most houses have zero value to me.  I also grow my own corn, so other people's corn is worth zero to me as well.  To a starving man, an ear of corn might be worth its weight in gold.

Value is *always* subjective, and *never* intrinsic.";0;1;False;manWhoHasNoName;d4ciyz2;Bitcoin has sustained a 25% rise for more than a week now and yet no post here has reached /all.

I think a large part of the issue is the mechanics of default subs. At some point the things that make a sub popular tends to ebb. But once you are a default sub your going to get a constant influx of new subscribers even if nobody ever subscribes. Although a new redditors defaults don't count, as soon as they add a sub, or remove a sub, all the defaults they didn't explicitly unsubscribe from start counting as a new subscriber. So basically a default sub can evolve to suck really bad and still maintain enough new subscribers to remain a default. They then set a social tone for the site as a whole.;6;1;False;mywan;d4c9uxq;Bitcoin has sustained a 25% rise for more than a week now and yet no post here has reached /all.

"Lol you don't have to explain your weird take on finance to me,  I've worked in private equity for a very long time and in m&a before that. And an extremely volatile commodity/currency like bitcoin and using basic trend analysis to invest is the stupidest investment proposal ive ever heard.  No one just puts in currencies to hold in a diversified portfolio,  the investnin cash generating l assets or an asset that has built in and predictable  inflationary effect. Cyptocurreny is a neat tool,  but it is not a feasible  investment. 



And on top of all that,  I highly doubt you have diversified significantly outside of bitcoin and only have a tiny percent of your portfolio on bitcoin,  so the diversification effect doesn't even work for you.

"Oh, just a moderator that was abusing their position and scrubbing the feed of anything to do with the Orlando shooter. Some claim it has happened more frequently with mentions of Muslims in a negative light, one pronounced example being rapes committed by refugees. So, naturally, people questioned why the content was being removed, the moderator responds to one user and tells them to kill themselves. Then, damage control started going on; any mention of the issue - as a standalone post - suddenly stopped hitting the front page.

Because that's the nature of exponential growth. Each bubble is exaggerated optimism, each crash is exaggerated pessimism, and the real value of the market is somewhere in between, visible only shortly between the boom bust cycles. The real value carries the long term direction of the price, but weekly/monthly movements are driven mostly by emotions and are a part of a big cycle which you can't explain with news and expert knowledge. This isn't the dollar or the euro. It's digital gold. And every so called gold expert shits himself when the price collapses, because he could never see it coming and can only explain it by patching up whatever information from the past he feels fits into his retoric. In other words, there are no experts who will know how the price will evolve. Neither in stocks nor in resources. Don't let anyone fool you. The S&P will beat 99 percent of hedge funds in the long term - except a few lucky ones who think they're good - they're not. In a big crowd of people who place different bets, there are bound to be a few lucky ones. ;1;0;False;TenshiS;d4cq7rd;Bitcoin has sustained a 25% rise for more than a week now and yet no post here has reached /all.

"This is the key issue.

Some of us want a nice stable currency to use (the fact that the Kebab i bought on Monday cost me BTC that would have been worth 15-20% more today is not a good thing) while others seem to wantto buy in, watch it grow and cash out.

This seems to be the issue with a lot of wealthy, investor types. They don't like it cause it's too volatile. Last wealthy investor type i spoke to said: ""BTC's going to cause a lot of tears"" and ""If you don't understand it, stay away from it.""

They're looking at it as an investment, rather than a currency.

We saw it shoot up to $1000 in the recent past. Then drop back down to $400.
