"No disagreement on whether bitcoin is ready for that. However I hold a different view on what would transpire. It is my belief that the banking system would of necessity adopt btc as a currency, and all the current high volume functions (Visa/Mastercard) would continue but based on bitcoin. They would after all be adding value bridging the time gap of 10 mins, and indeed we already have btc based Visa/Mastercards!  However over time the newer high volume (layered protocol) solutions to bitcoin such as lightning and sidechains would eat their lunch (again). 

As a side note, I believe that as a USD takes hold, merchants will be looking for a more stable currency to price their goods in. If USD goes down there are going to be no stable fiats out there, so the logical choice would be btc.

Nobody 'knows' what will happen, all we can do is try and play it out in our head and guess based on our own experiences. So if  you think you 'know' you are wrong.

">There is no practical reason why over the course of time we would not see banks offering bitcoin accounts with Visa/Mastercard providing the appropriate card services denominated in bitcoin.

What currency would Visa/Mastercards be transferring?

it can't be Bitcoin because it takes too long and doesn't have the transaction capacity. So either its something that you use as a token for value that isn't tied to the value of bitcoin (i.e. a fiat currency, as Bitcoin debit cards currently do), or its a currency tied to the value of bitcoin (i.e. a pegged currency).

>Good old Nixon unpegged from gold not as a logical choice but as the only choice since you (USA) couldn't get a hold of enough gold to match your money printing aspirations.

Every national currency in the world is unpegged from gold. If fiat currency was a competitive disadvantage compared to gold standard why the wouldn't a single country have kept the gold standard given that it took decades to phase out the gold standard.

>Yeah ok, bitcoin is deflationary, and nobody really knows how we would adjust to that as a society. We have spent generations building up debt for future generations, if there is a way to step off the roundabout then some scuffed kneecaps would be a price worth paying.

Deflationary currencies like gold have now become stores of wealth because people don't spend deflationary currency they hoard it, which slows the economy because everyone is waiting for their currency to become worth more instead of spending it. Inflationary currencies work great because people don't like to leave currency sitting losing value they want to invest it or spend it on things as quickly as possible before it loses value. 

Bitcoin has become predominantly a store of wealth rather than a currency for the same reason.

>Bitcoin is more volatile that USD now. But it's all relative, as value flows to bitcoin it's volatility has and will continue to drop and vice versa for the USD

That isn't happening. Bitcoin was far less volatile in its first 6 months than it has been in its last 6 months. Mainly because it was only a few nerds actually using it rather than millions of people ~~gambling on it~~ investing in it. Increasing speculation makes the risk of large market corrections higher, not lower.

The percentage of people using bitcoin as a currency has decreased at the same time the amount of people speculating on it has skyrocketed. This is the opposite of what you want to see if you want it to become a stable, functional currency.";1;1;False;suninabox;doi1zh3;Waiting for the Bitcoin bubble to burst.;76flwd;https://i.redd.it/xsvh37tatvrz.jpg
"Do you understand how banks work? You think they pass money around in real time?? A bank account is just a set of numbers in a computer made up by the bank, the net of the transactions between these virtual accounts is what settlement does, typically on a daily basis. DAILY not 10 mins.

The real (truly international) gold standard only lasted 50 years, it was unsustainable because US had 75% of the worlds gold at the end of world war II (No profiting from war there!)

I'm not arguing the deflationary aspect (though you clearly want to), dunno how that will work but I suspect we will adapt.

Re- stability ah so you are arguing bitcoin is better off in a 2 year bear market because that was more stable?? Whilst I agree stability will come with actually usage, it will also come with speculation simply because the market cap (if there really is such a thing with a store of value)  will get too large to be moved by individual players, additionally a derivatives market will develop which assists stability also.";1;1;False;bell2366;doibubc;Waiting for the Bitcoin bubble to burst.;76flwd;https://i.redd.it/xsvh37tatvrz.jpg

"""These cards transfer dollars"" um and the rest, Visa/Mastercard is a multi-currency system linked to the banking system. There is no practical reason why over the course of time we would not see banks offering bitcoin accounts with Visa/Mastercard providing the appropriate card services denominated in bitcoin.

""The government creates a new currency pegged to bitcoin"" 
I didn't even come close to saying that.

Good old Nixon unpegged from gold not as a logical choice but as the only choice since you (USA) couldn't get a hold of enough gold to match your money printing aspirations.

Yeah ok, bitcoin is deflationary, and nobody really knows how we would adjust to that as a society. We have spent generations building up debt for future generations, if there is a way to step off the roundabout then some scuffed kneecaps would be a price worth paying.

Bitcoin is more volatile that USD now. But it's all relative, as value flows to bitcoin it's volatility has and will continue to drop and vice versa for the USD. There will come a day (IMHO) where bitcoin is seen as THE stable currency.

In terms if knowing the future I was just qualifying my own statements, and to some degree chiding your statements as over assertive on what WILL happen. It's all just opinion.

Those cards still transfer dollars. They can only operate with a non-blockchain currency to use as a medium of exchange.

So the dollar collapses, the government creates a new currency that's pegged to bitcoin. Why?

The government had dollars pegged to gold for years, but then realized its more useful not to peg a currency to a resource, that way you can increase and decrease the supply of money based on the needs of the economy rather than how much of one resource you can get hold of.

Bitcoin is deflationary, which is not what governments want from a currency because governments (and corporations) run on debt, and deflation discourages debt by making debt more expensive over time.

Not only do governments want debt but so do individuals and corporations. If the average person got a mortgage in bitcoin 2 years ago they would already be bankrupt. No one wants to save money for things because the marginal utility is terrible. Saving for 30 years and then buying a house is a lot less useful than buying the house with debt and then paying it off for 30 years. You still end up paying the same amount, but you get to use the house for 30 years whilst you're paying.

>As a side note, I believe that as a USD takes hold, merchants will be looking for a more stable currency to price their goods in. If USD goes down there are going to be no stable fiats out there, so the logical choice would be btc.

Bitcoin is far more volatile than USD or any other major fiat currency. This is not an argument in favor of bitcoin.

>Nobody 'knows' what will happen, all we can do is try and play it out in our head and guess based on our own experiences. So if you think you 'know' you are wrong.

No one knows the future, that's not a meaningful point to make. That doesn't mean that you can't say anything about what is likely to happen. Gold is not likely to be replaced by bottlecaps as a store of value, USD is not likely to be replaced by bitcoin as a functional currency.";3;1;False;suninabox;dohk39n;Waiting for the Bitcoin bubble to burst.;76flwd;https://i.redd.it/xsvh37tatvrz.jpg
