yes, drugs should be legal and he should not be in jail. but ross ulbricht knew what he was doing. he broke the law, he wasn't careful and he got fucked hard for it. he also attempted to hire people to murder those that hurt his business. why is he being idolized as some sort of hero? he isn't. he's just some guy. let him fade into obscurity. there are far better role models that are better people that shouldn't be in jail for the crimes they committed. and he isn't one of them.";86;4;False;invictus1;dhwed2w;Hi, my name is Ross Ulbricht;6cp2ql;https://i.redd.it/djb8i3hoh3zy.jpg

">They improperly brought it up at the trial briefly

As far as I'm aware that evidence was never challenged by Ross or his defence team.

>He was never charged with the hitmen for hire

Yes he was:
http://www.businessinsider.com/ross-ulbricht-charged-in-2nd-silk-road-murder-for-hire-plot-2013-10?IR=T

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Ulbricht#Silk_Road.2C_arrest_and_trial

I have no idea why this narrative keeps coming up. It's demonstrably false and can be checked with the briefest of Google searches. The charge was, however, later dropped. To say he was 'never charged' is simply factually false.

Also, this helps to flesh this out a little, from Wikipedia:
>Ulbricht was charged with money laundering, computer hacking, conspiracy to traffic narcotics,[19][23] and procuring murder.[20] The charge of procuring murder was removed from the indictment[24] although the evidence was factored into Ulbricht's sentence.

There is no point in charging him for the murder parts as he was going to get life in jail without possibility of parole anyway. Why the charges were dropped is speculated here: https://www.dailydot.com/crime/silk-road-murder-charges-ross-ulbricht/ but we'll probably never know for sure. If Ross gets an appeal granted against his sentence, you can safely bet those charges might suddenly become un-dropped.

I'm not saying the trail was perfectly executed, I'm not saying the judgement was even fair given the crimes he was actually sent down for, that's another discussion. What I am saying is that: Yes he was charged, those charges were later dropped, *however* the evidence that he attempted to procure murder was taken into consideration during sentencing, not that it mattered as he would have gotten life without parole anyway.";14;3;False;Sugartits31;dhwivou;Hi, my name is Ross Ulbricht;6cp2ql;https://i.redd.it/djb8i3hoh3zy.jpg

With this thinking, you could justify selling gunpowder in sweet shops... or in this case, selling guns on Amazon.com.

There's a difference between a product that *can* be used to kill versus a product that's made *specifically* to kill.

No, but I estimate it's far lower than the number of people who OD from street drugs.  When there are customer reviews on a product that buyers can read without the vendor even knowing, it's in the vendor's interest to sell quality.

Most ODs are because of adulterated product (e.g. the current Fentanyl problem in many parts of the world) or mistaking one substance for another entirely.

Drugs from Silk Road were of a consistently higher quality than those found on the street, and this continues with the many dark net markets that followed and are active today.

Honestly I'm not one of the people who jumps to the conclusion of saying it didn't happen, however these accusations were never included as charges in the case and he was never found guilty of this. Therefore there is no way this shouldve factored into the sentencing - and yet it did.;16;0;False;;dhwfwqh;Hi, my name is Ross Ulbricht;6cp2ql;https://i.redd.it/djb8i3hoh3zy.jpg

"Since I've been reading these comments I've learnt that the modern version (3.0) of the Silk Road prohibits the sale of *“anything whose purpose is to harm or defraud.”*

However, the DPR case was four years ago in 2013 - when there were no such restrictions; you could buy weed just as easily as guns.

"Damn guys.. For Aussie is a different story: 
""As part of its push to foster innovation and fintech startup businesses in Australia, the government's 2017 Federal Budget will cut the GST for purchases of digital currency, allowing Bitcoin and online games' in-game money to be treated just like plain Australian dollars for tax purposes.
At the moment, anyone purchasing a digital currency in Australia is technically liable for GST expenses on that purchase. From 1 July 2017, though, the government is exempting purchases of digital currency from Australia's 10 per cent Goods and Services tax.""
