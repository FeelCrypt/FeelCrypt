Very good! Bitcoin is rather new currency but it has a big future. Maybe in several years we would be using bitcoins.

"We have no federal agency dedicated to predicting asset bubbles. It was kind of a perfect storm in the last recession considering the huge amounts of information asymmetry regarding the default risks associated with the MBS (investment banks thought MBS were stable for good reason). Also the rise of the shadow banking sector forced conventional depository banks to compete with their new unregulated counterparts.

The FED is largely a reactive institution they see a problem and counteract it. Blaming them is sort of like blaming your doctor for you getting sick in the first place. It's like saying ""Why did the doctor not see my fever coming if his theories are so deep and valid"". It's almost impossible to reliably predict recessions. And if you act preemptively you may induce excess inflation. The main criticism of the FED during last recession is that they didn't act aggressively enough to keep up consistent NGDP growth. They were given oversight power in Dodd-Frank and now stress test banks in order to see that they maintain capital adequacy. The conventional banking sector is far more stable now at the very least, though shadow banking is still a worry.";1;1;False;IDontGiveAFuckDude;dn3b9y0;The difference between inflation and deflation...;6yn8hs;https://i.redd.it/zs4byvahrgkz.jpg

It's pretty hard to prevent asset bubbles. The fed didn't really have any regulatory power prior to 2008. There's been a lot criticism that they didn't act aggressively enough to sustain 2% inflation and they made a few questionable policy decisions (introducing IOR etc.) They also allowed NGDP to contract which is pretty much never a good idea.;1;1;False;IDontGiveAFuckDude;dn295jx;The difference between inflation and deflation...;6yn8hs;https://i.redd.it/zs4byvahrgkz.jpg

They'd get nervous and sell into the wale's crash, the wale would then send in a buy wall, price would rise massively, and wale would sell out at a strong profit. That explains a lot of price movements. I mean with  Bitcoin, as soon as it breached $3000 to the decimal place a massive buy wall came in - that's a pre-planned wale action. The small holder is the guy who bought at $4500, got nervous, and sold at $3000. He loses, wale wins.;1;1;False;missymole;dn37kdt;Probably JP Morgan;709hed;https://i.redd.it/iqpmt8c4i1mz.png

"I'm not talking about what might happen and what will happen to the value of bitcoin... you might be right, it might be a bubble, it might fall to 2000 or 1000. It might be inflated value or so on...
I'm just pointing out a simple economic fact that cost of something does not equal the value of it. The cost of a 16oz fountain Coca Cola is a penny or two, the value of it in the market is a couple bucks. It doesn't care if the value is inflated or if their selling it too expansive or if it's gonna fall. It doesn't matter. The value is simply not equal to cost. The cost and value are def relevant to one another but they are not necessarily equal.

And why would you even bring up dollar being backed by gold when you know the dollar is not backed by gold. The current value of dollar has nothing to do with gold cause there ain't no gold backing it. The value of dollar is the value that market gives it. Even if it was backed by gold then the question would be: what is the value of gold? Def not the cost of mining the gold!!
See, in the case of dollar, there is NOT ""a physical thing that crest real value""
Not sure if it's a typical case of ""oh I'm speculating crypto without fully understanding fiat or you're trying to imply that the fact that dollar was backed by gold 40 years ago is what gives it value today. 

See what I mean?!?! I don't care if the price is too high or too low, I'm just pointing out to you that cost doesn't equal value. 

Another few examples to clarify that concept would be these: 

1: there is a cost in electricity and computing power in calculating a random, very difficult math problem (not talking about bitcoin's) but if you were to pay that cost and solve that math problem the solution or answer you've arrived at doesn't necessarily have the value of the computing power you spent. The value will be determined by the usefulness and the utility of that solution. If it was an obscure math problem that no one cares about it'll be worth(valued) nothing even if you spent $2000 computing the solution. 
Cost =/= value 

2: the cost of cooking a dish that you'd buy in a restaurant is usually equal to %45 to %70 of the price they charge you for (depending on the dish and the restaurant) (the cost is calculated by adding the ingredients, labor, and rent of the place). The value of the dish (what you're willing to pay for it) tho is higher than the cost of course.
See what I'm trying to get at? Value and cost are correlated but almost usually, never the same.
So to say the value of bitcoin is what it costs to mine it is to totally ignore the market
P.s. I have seen that video of mcafee. I don't vividly remember it but I think he was pointing out that there's a cost in making bitcoin and it doesn't come from thin air. I'm not sure if he was trying to imply that cost equals value.";1;0;False;blackwaterbayhero;dn3bejx;Probably JP Morgan;709hed;https://i.redd.it/iqpmt8c4i1mz.png

"Sure if we accept your made up bullshit definition that works. Except the internet was a government funded project (arpanet). The microchip was a government funded project. The GPS is a military project. The touchscreen was a government funded project. As was the cell phone. 

Listen I get it. I remember when I was 16 and first discovered right wing libertarian ideals. Eventually you will look around and realize that the free market is a lie. Free market capitalism will never happen, because the capitalism we have today is the natural progression of capitalism. It isn't free. It's a replacement of feudalism with its own new hierarchy where the rich completely own the poor. Austrian economics is a lie. It does not work. The founders of your ideology worked for brutal oppressive tyrants in South America. 

>In Pinochet's Chile, Hayek predicted, ""we will witness a transition from a dictatorial government to a liberal government...during this transition it may be necessary to maintain certain dictatorial powers, not as something permanent, but as a temporary arrangement.""

Yup Hayek was a supporter of a brutal dictator and reasoned it was necessary to maintain dictorial powers. That's the roots of right wing libertarians right there. They don't seek freedom, they seek power through the markets over other people. One day you will grow up and realize that the imposters you think of as libertarians are nothing of the sort. The real libertarians, the people you guys stole the word from, are leftists. We reject both the state and the Free market and instead know that the best force for freedom involves no hierarchy, but in cooperation of people working together.

In theory, hundred dollar bills have their value because they are backed by gold in the federal reserve, not the paper they're printed on. There is ALWAYS a physical thing that create REAL value. The things that do not have a physical use / backing fail almost 100% of the time. This $3600 value is grossly inflated and it won't be the value for long. It's gonna be a while but we'll be around the $2000 mark soon. John Mcafee (if you haven't yet, watch all of his videos about bitcoin, very interesting/ informative) the biggest bitcoin miner in the USA was just on an interview the other day and said the value is literally the energy used to make the coin, which costs around $1,000 right now. You are not wrong, your just early. The price is falling and will continue to fall for a while until its actual value is restored. Then in another few years when the coins are halved again, we'll have another massive price jump. When there are no more bitcoin to be mined is when we get to see what people are willing to pay because they can no longer acquire them by mining themselves. ;1;1;False;Regulater86;dn39y2l;Probably JP Morgan;709hed;https://i.redd.it/iqpmt8c4i1mz.png

"**Association fallacy**

An association fallacy is an informal inductive fallacy of the hasty-generalization or red-herring type and which asserts, by irrelevant association and often by appeal to emotion, that qualities of one thing are inherently qualities of another. Two types of association fallacies are sometimes referred to as guilt by association and honor by association.

Do you fucking understand the break in logic there?! Is bitcoin racist becasue it's decentralized and means we dont have to rely on the centralized authority anymore!?!

DO you fucking understand how liberalism has been subverted by authoritarian collectivism? This started in the 1960s and 70s at academic institutions by members of the KGB and then authoritarian political groups started following along. Here is an interveiw with an ex kgb agent who explains how the kgb did this:
>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bX3EZCVj2XA

Your hypothesis is that a strong central authority protects minorities and lgbt people from evil oppressive states like South Carolina who, for example, banned trans people from certain bathrooms, but then you fail to take into account the vulnerability that centralized authoritarian systems have, which under democracy, means they will always go along 100 percent with the swinging political pendulum. Are you trying to tell me states rights is better for transexual people when Trump got elected and banned trans sexual people from the military, which itself could use more decentralization? Obviously you are wrong and decentralized systems are more robust and allow people to have their cake and eat it to. 

Right now racists, homophobes, and communists are forced to assimilate in an artificially homogeneous society, where their ideas and seduction only made more powerful by the forced centralization. States rights would mean that **states like California could remain bastions of freedom and tolerance** even in the face of adverse political conditions. The problem is that this does not benefit federal politicians who only seek to gain more central authority, and the two most perpetrating groups are neo-cons and neo-liberals. You have unquestionably fallen under their spell and only serve to prevent oppressed people from seeking refuge in states which could guarantee them freedom if they had more rights!!! 

What about drug addicts?! They are perhaps the most oppressed minority in the world right now and they are now subject to the will and law of the federal government which is subject to mass discrimination by the ignorant populace! What if states were granted more rights and could provide a safe haven for drug addicts from the war on drugs? Your ignorance and brainwashing is only serving to perpetuate oppression!

I can hear your maniacal laughter as you stuff Doritos in your face and have them crumbling all over your smart phone or computer keyboard, because what you value most is being aggressive towards people, either directly or passive aggressively like you did to the original comment from the other user when I first replied to you. Low-level peon that leaves misspelled words so you can't decipher what the fuck you're saying, only to edit it later (because you care so much about how you're perceived anonymously on the Reddit platform--or, perhaps, the cheesy fingers from the Doritos are to blame). Spend more time on Reddit. I'm not here to just talk shit to random people every time I see an opening like you. There are better things you can do with your time.

"**Association fallacy**

An association fallacy is an informal inductive fallacy of the hasty-generalization or red-herring type and which asserts, by irrelevant association and often by appeal to emotion, that qualities of one thing are inherently qualities of another. Two types of association fallacies are sometimes referred to as guilt by association and honor by association.

"Are *you* fucking retarded? That guy was most likely being sarcastic in an attempt to insult anyone who doesnt believe the mainstream narrative with regards to the protest. And even if he wasn't, and was being sincere, then why the fucking hell would you assume that russia is behind that comment? Even if you are joking this ultimately proves that you are brainwashed by the likes of CNN and MSNBC into believing any conspiratorial views against the neo liberal establsihment and radical leftist groups!!!

Just becasue Russia, may or may not have, leaked information about corruption in the United States political system that does not disqualify the material in question. Have ever heard the saying the *enemy of my enemy is my friend?* Russia may have different interests than us overall but they share an interest with the voting public in exposing corruption by the neo liberal establishment. If they leaked information about Trump, which they supposedly have with the Pee-Pee-dossier then they share a related interest with the voting public which the left was more than happy to embrace:

Here is some true Russian subversion for you. An ex KGB agent explaining how they subverted liberalism in the 60s and 70s with authoritarian collectivism by introducing the idea that freedom may serve to promote inequality and they injected this into academic institutions which the liberal establishment has now coopted in an effort to keep power to this day:

And yes I am aware of the growing trend of white nationalists and nazis among our youth, specifically because I have dedicated so much fucking time to arguing with them on 4chan, but I have also spent an equal amount of time arguing with radical leftists about the need for freedom and the consequences of violence! You are ignorantly unaware of the danger that groups like ANTIFA pose to our freedom, because they are openly promoting violence and there are even establishment groups trying to egg them on in an effort to get them to do some mass violent atrocity so they can gain more power for the totalitarian police state!!!

Check out the above forum. There are people on there calling for violence and for destroying our **entire financial system** and seizing our freedoms in an effort to redistribute wealth, but they fail to realize how this would only empower the police state. I know that racism is abhorrent and terrible but that is already established as wrong. How many people do you think would justify stealing from a rich person though and do you recognize how that may be an even greater problem which people are unaware of? 

I understand that crypto currency may **replace** our financial system and redistribute wealth but this would happen in an organic manner while still respecting what people have already worked for while violent communists wish to violently steal from who they falsely perceive as their oppressors and destabilize our entire society!!

"I skimmed the article. Do you understand how freedom works? People and groups are allowed to fail and the successful ones persist. Just like nature and evolution. Thats why freedom and capitalism has produced better technology and products than any socialist or planned economy, because the competition and failure *breeds* the best version organically, just like your oppression creates more robust individuals which evolve as a result of your persecution. Even China today has allowed state capitalism where the bourgeois elite are allowed to compete against eachother and it's the only reason that they have produced anything of quality. Remember when ""made in china"" was a common phrase associated with poor quality? 

And the best part is that you are allowed to create your own authoritarian, socialist, or communist microcosm inside of a freemarket or free society, which is kind of how china works where the elite brutality rule over the proletariat yet are part of their own capitalist macrocosm. This means that you are allowed to have your cake and eat it to; people like you who are attracted to cuckism are allowed to form your own oppressive communities in a free society which seeks to serve individual preferences, yet you are here arguing that large scale freedom is harmful? That is illogical and analogous to someone losing a game of kickball then running home with ball so no one else can play the game, and nothing but butt hurt jealously.  

And you mistakenly equate libertarian ideals with a dogmatic either-or situation instead of accepting reality, which is that it is happening gradually by replacing authoritarian centralized institutions with free, decentralized, private ones in a way which keeps the successful outcome while gradually granting more freedom to the individual or community. It's an absolute strawman you are building when you infer that libertarianism has to equal unstable, violent anarchy. Crypto-currency is an example of this kind of practical anarchism which competes with and gradually replaces the usual authoritarian financial institutions. The open source and free software movements are another example and they still have empowered their contributing members to profit and produce wealth, arguably more efficiently than closed source, non-free software. 

Anyway. I am not interested in debating your false theories and wicked strawmen but rather I am curious to why authoritarianism appeals to you personally?

"Sure is, since for some reason they're allowed to require that the merchants don't differentiate the costs between different payment options in their service contracts. But for every dollar charged to your card the vendor will recieve a smaller amount and the cost of this difference has to be passed on to you in some shape or form. Besides taking a straight up percentage there can also be a combination of fixed charges per transaction and monthly services charges.

Not sure how credit card companies handles non-payment in particular, but I used to work for a debt collecting company specialized in consumer credits for a little while. Outstanding consumer credits in general, basically anything that comes in the form of a bill, that aren't keeping up with their plan is usually sold off to a debt collecting service at a loss. The debt collecting company make their profits in the difference between the amount they manage to collect and the price they paid for said debts. If that really was where you could make a real killing, you'd probably see debt collecting services actually paying a premium for taking on those debts because of competition. But this is looking at non-payers as a group, within that group there is variation and for those that end up paying the total it sure isn't cheap to have ended up on the recieving side of this.";1;0;False;tLNTDX;dn37efr;Kim Dotcom: No Government can stop the rise of crypto now.

"Ever heard of the ""association fallacy?""
>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_fallacy

Its related to ad hominen and you are trying to falsely associate conservatism, classical liberalism, and libertarianism with white nationalists just like the mainstream media did proving the person's point who you are responding to! The white nationalists were also acting in order to achieve the same goal and *you are only helping them.* Therefore you are more of a white supremacist or nazi than some random conservative person, because your goal of subversion is the same as the white nationalists and nazis.

No, I don't. You're a wackjob. Kim only does whatever will make him money; legitimate or otherwise. He's not trying to erase anything, he moves from one scheme to the next.

"**Association fallacy**

An association fallacy is an informal inductive fallacy of the hasty-generalization or red-herring type and which asserts, by irrelevant association and often by appeal to emotion, that qualities of one thing are inherently qualities of another. Two types of association fallacies are sometimes referred to as guilt by association and honor by association.

"That's just a defense mechanism because you have rationalized your own sacrifice of freedom so you get triggered when people wont do the same. Its an irrational *petty* form of jealousy because you have given up already and other people who still have some life left in them threaten your ego and your rational mind knows theyre right. 

And btw, even though you wish to define libertarianism as the dissolution of the state as a way of discrediting it; libertarianism can mean different things such as simply striving towards more freedom and decentralization. Crypto currency achieves this beautifully, and Uber is another less pefect example. Uber and bitcoin are both tools which help someone become their own boss and rely less on centralized authoritarian institutions. They are both tools which give an individual more agency, something which obviously threatens your pathetic self esteem and ego which you have invested so heavily in authoritarianism and collectivism. Bitcoin and other forms of practical anarchism give individuals more equal opportunities versus things which you may like, such as communism, which only serve to level the outcomes by oppressing the brightest.

"NO one fucking said that. But people are being falsely associated with those people. Just because someone calls themselves the same thing you are that does not mean you share the same views as them. Those white nationalists were attempting to subvert conservatives and libertarians and the way mainstream media covered it only helped them while ignoring radical leftist groups which are arguably just as big of a problem or even more threatening to our safety. If you dont believe me go check out /leftypol/ where they are actively cheering on violence. 

Guilty by association **is** a logical fucking fallacy and here you are trying to use it.

"Hear me out on a different approach, guy...

Is Ethereum the iPhone of crypto, and is Bitcoin the Android? I think so. Because in the long-term (which is what you are talking about, and it's what I believe truly matters as this market expands into applications we haven't yet realized)... Ethereum is still a walled garden! Bitcoin is Old Reliable. It's Android/Windows/Linux-esque. Ethereum is like the App Store.

Both have their qualities. People use Android/Windows/Linux even though Apple is by far the biggest from a market cap standpoint.

Step back... and think, Can society really go from this system to crypto system in one year? Two years? Five years? Ten years? Sure, a few countries with progressive monetary policy will adopt crypto. We will see huge gains in blockchain. But a NATION'S MONEY, a BANK'S MONEY, money that's designated for high-security SAFEKEEPING, money that's transferred with completely PRIVATE & ANONYMOUS data, money that is meant to be transferred IMMEDIATELY for point-of-sale, ... Then of course the tech innovations on top of the currency itself... DYOR
