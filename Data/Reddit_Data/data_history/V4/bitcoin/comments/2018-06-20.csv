When you think of how we mined different things out of the ground, it probably became apparent that x was rarer than y and z was rarer than x.  After it is assigned a value even, like one gold pound was equal to three bags of rice or something, doesn't mean that value would hold today for \~$1200 per oz. In fact, Gold seems so intrinsically valued for so long, that we based our currency off it. In a way it developed to be a part of its inherent value.

"True, but 2 factors mitigate that.

The first is that the overall market is very thin there. People doing illegal things have been beaten / detained / disappeared, so that's keeping the need for bitcoin liquidity low.

The second is that electricity is ridiculously cheap there so some of the more wealthy people are mining crypto as much as possible so there is an available liquid pool.

"Correct. However, you don't earn a dollar and sit on it for 15 years. You either spend it right away, invest it in something relatively safe (banks, U.S. Treasury) to decrease the effect of inflation, invest in something more risky, such as stocks, real estate, alternatives, or even start your own small business. There are many ways to keep up with inflation. I think that many people are not literate enough to know how to avoid inflation, but at least they can do something with the currently available currencies unlike the one whose owners just keep saying ""HODL, To the moon, I am in for the tech.""

With fiat money, you can at least predict inflation most of the time. With BTC, if someone bought it 7 months ago for $20,000, now that person has the same amount of BTC but only $6,500. In the end, if he/she wants to spend money, he/she will have to convert it in dollars, which means a loss of $13,500 in 6 months.

"Short answer:  Hal Finney


Long answer: A great question.  Depends on how you define create.   

Bitcoin is created by tens of thousands of people in a process called mining.  New bitcoin are created when miners successfully solve an intentionally difficult math problem and in the process they confirm the transactions on the network.  So, anyone who wants to mine is a creator.

Or, maybe you might mean the person who first conceived of using a solution to the (previously unsolved) Byzantine Generals problem as a way to create an unforgeable electronic cash system.  The author of that paper used the pen name Satoshi Nakamoto.  If you could conclusively identify who that person was, you'd answer a mystery that has gone on for several years.  Hal Finney (an early developer) seems as likely a candidate as any other.

Part of the genius of BTC is that it is decentralized...meaning no one person owns it (or even creates it).  This eliminates a point of failure, since a decentralized coin cannot be attacked by silencing any one individual or organization.";1;0;False;AManInBlack2017;e10bfrb;FACT: Even if you bought Bitcoin at 20k in Venezuela, you're still better off than if you just held Bolivars.;8sh4om;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8sh4om/fact_even_if_you_bought_bitcoin_at_20k_in/

"OK... First, bitcoin isn't exactly deflationary. The only reason we say it is because we will forever lose some bitcoin throughout time and no more than 21 million. It has a stable supply nevertheless so it isn't truly deflationary since the supply doesn't decrease by feature. If anything their is currently 1800 bitcoin ""printed"" into circulation every day. 

Now at some point, bitcoin will stop going moon. This is because (if the stars align) it has become a very real and recognized currency all over the world. Bitcoin should in theory stabilize and won't be so volatile anymore. 

Now the truth is deflationary or inflationary does not protect bad markets. With inflationary currency, everyone suffers since bailouts and printing more money happen. It takes a huge toll on the currency itself. The value of the entire economy goes down. With a deflationary/stable currency, only business suffers but only slightly since I'm sure they didn't fully blast their bitcoin into investment. The worst case scenario is bitcoin becomes more valuable and we lower prices, maybe even wages but our currency and bank accounts are nice and strong. We can jump start the economy over again after this setback for investors and businesses which AGAIN still happen with inflation currencies.

How about loans? This business booms in a deflationary currency even if the rates are fixed so that I don't overpay the value of my loan (ex.  I borrow $1000, pay back $1000 value, not total amount first borrowed). This may seem like they lose but in reality they earn more since  inflation didn't kill the value of the $1000 they are supposed to get. Plus the interest rate on the loan means they will be more profitable than before. 

It seems stupid because we have an economy set up to work with inflationary currencies. You can't just plug in a currency like bitcoin and expect everything ton work out and I'm not saying the transition (if it ever came to this)  would be crazy to adjust to Bitcoin's set rules. 

Also would like to add that bitcoin could very well die in the future but the idea of a decentralized currency can't.

Several reasons. If Bitcoin is supposed to be a legitimate currency, why are we comparing to a currency that is on the brink of failing. It would be like saying North Korea is doing well because its not murdering 25% of their population like the Khmer Rouge. And a currency having crazy devaluations is not a good currency. You look for returns with currency, you use it goods/services and investments. Otherwise by just keeping it in an account gaining value means it has no use to an economy as its not being used to help produce anything. If Bitcoin was used as the only currency with stable devaluations then you have the issue Japan faced in its lost decade. But yeah be glad with your returns, keep buying and hoarding and limiting those who could really use it. Keep wanting the price to increase, so those in the countries where they actually need to protect their currencies from authoritarian rulers can't afford it. But yeah great returns. From a currency. Where stability is essential.
