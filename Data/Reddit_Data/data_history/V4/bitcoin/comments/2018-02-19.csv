"most people have the passwords/mnemonic phrase/private keys written down/backed up somewhere (since forgetting the password is a bad idea), which is why in most cases bitcoins have been seized the government has been able to get the keys as well.

having no backup/hardcopy doesn't eliminate risk it just changes one to another, from having someone steal it to forgetting it. Plenty of people have lost access to their own bitcoins.

Even if they can't get the keys they can still get the bitcoins, and if someone tries to move them at a later date they're not going to have to look very far to find out who did it.

Its hypothetical security is irrelevant compared to its real world security. Anything is technically unseizable if you hide it somewhere and don't tell anyone the location. The problem comes when you actually want to use it.

The fact bitcoin has to connect to the internet to be used makes it much less secure (which is why hundreds of thousands have been stolen in hacks so far, greater than any equivalent bank heist), because you can't download someones gold over the internet.

Traditional banking gets around this by having monopoly control over a private network, so if someone steals your bank details and moves money out of your account, and you can prove it, the bank has to refund you.

"**Byzantine fault tolerance**

Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) is the resistance of a fault-tolerant computer system, particularly distributed computing systems, towards electronic component failures where there is imperfect information on whether a component is failed. In a ""Byzantine failure"", a component such as a server can inconsistently appear both failed and functioning to failure detection systems, presenting different symptoms to different observers. It is difficult for the other components to declare it failed and shut it out of the network, because they need to first reach a consensus regarding which component is failed in the first place. The term is derived from the Byzantine Generals' Problem, where actors must agree on a concerted strategy to avoid catastrophic system failure, but some of the actors are unreliable.

Is it just coincidental that transactions decreased dramatically from batching at exactly the same time as price started crashing?

Let's say that is the case, and major exchanges just started batching at the same time, and it happened to account for a huge amount of transactions, this doesn't help the case that there's greater adoption.

That means well over 50% of bitcoin traffic is from exchanges, which means people just buying and selling bitcoin for other currencies.

That's why metrics like how many of the biggest 500 retailers are using bitcoin matter because they tell you whether people are actually using bitcoin as a currency or just speculating and day trading.

Do you think no one consumes anything, or ever will?  If everyone hoards, and goods are being produced, I'm gonna buy the shit out of it and live like a king.  Eventually there gets to be a point where people say ""fuck deferred consumption, this is great now"".  Plus people already have a time preference for consuming in the present.

Hoarded cash isn't investment, correct.  It's simply a representation of a preference for deferred consumption.

Yes, if it all of a sudden went, prices go up, and then the preference for consumption goes down.  But if you see a bunch of people holding cash for future consumpion, and prices are low, you can make a killing preparing for it and investing (e.g. R&D, expanding factories, etc...) so that you can produce a ton when the time comes to change.

Alternatively, you can get together with a lot of other people and all mine together and have Bob take the rewards and split them depending on how much you mine daily.

Hey hey hey everybody, 
My name is Carlos Matos and I am coming from New York City, New York
Let me tell you guys that I am SO EXCITED, I am SO HAPPY
I am really so thrilled to be right now, 
Sharing this amazing, glorious, SUPER and EXCITING moment of my life with all of you guys
-and let me tell you that we are really changing the WORLD as we know it
The WORLD is not anymore the way it used to be
mmh mmh NO NO NOH.

BitcoNNEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEECT
WOOOoo
bitconnEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEECT

We are coming and we are coming in waves
We are starting and to actually go all over the world
We all built in the entire world
Let me tell you guys that I started 137 days ago, with only 25 thousand six hundred and ten dollars
-and right now I am reaching one hundred and forty THOUSAND dollars

WOAH WOAH WOAH WOAH WOAH WOAH WOAH
WHAT'S UP

And let me tell you that I am actually earning around one hun- 
I mean around one thousand four hundred dollars on an everyday basis seven days a week
WHAT?!!?

I am right now independently, financially independently, I am saying to so many people who say that this is going to be a con artist game, that this was gonna be a scammer game: “Hey, you are gonna lose all your mone-” 
My WIFE still doesn’t believe in me! I’m telling her “Well honey this is real”
“No no no no no no, that’s a scam!”
And I say “But wait I’m gonna go to the banks, I’m gonna get my bitcoins, I’m gonna actually put it into dollars, here they are right on the table!”
“Aww, that’s money that you took from one of the accounts!”
I say: “What am I gonna do?”
Then I said to myself, “You know what? When I started to put ten thousand dollars a day on her, right on her, y’know on her table” 
Then she’s gonna say: “WOOOOW.”
HA-HA-HA-HA-h.
“YEAYEYEYEYEYE OK, THAT’S REAL”
HAHAHAHAH

So guys, I wanna tell you something:
Faith and belief is the one thing we will need to be able to change the world. And right now, I believe, that in this room, we have the seed, that’s gonna germinate, and that is going to EXPLODE, into an AMMMAZING opportunity for us to change this entire world.

I am so proud, I am so honored, I am so EXCITED to be here right now-
And hey let me tell you something, that each and every one of YOU, has the opportunity to become, like those amazing people that we know here FROM VIET NAM! 
HEY HEY, MY PRPL(indistinguishable)-VIET NAM, making so much money that they can probably have a real hard time counting it! 

*wheeze*AHAHAHAHAHAh

So GUYS, let me tell you:

"That's what the article claims:

> Within a democracy it is illegal for state actors or contractors to engage in propaganda directed at their own citizens.

But I doubt it. A campaign like this could easily be defined as public education to make people aware of risks - overstated for effect, like any advertising. It's not really different from people here warning against shitcoins, or a number of warnings about high prices by Vitalik.

If a central bank seriously started to campaign against crypto, it would do more than paying $30K for a video. It would instruct banks to refuse crypto-related companies and transactions.

In general, propaganda is a subjective term. Which law would make it illegal? The most contentious examples of government propaganda I've seen in the Netherlands, like a city council publishing its own local newspaper, violated democratic norms rather than laws.

"Well, it seems more dramatic than it actually is. 

Yes, the truth is that Polish National Bank introduced a campaign that warns people about dangers of bitcoin.

But the other fact is that, unfortunately, Polish YouTube scene is full of people that just want to make money. Many of the YouTube creators would sell content of their channel for a low price just because they don't have any long-term cooperations. Also the market of YouTubers in Poland is really well organised - with Multi Channel Networks which work just like talent agencies. 

The fact is that the cost of the campaign according to this article was over 91k PLN (~27k USD).
https://bithub.pl/wiadomosci/nbp-przeznaczyl-prawie-100-000-zl-kampanie-dotyczaca-problematyki-walut-wirtualnych/BUT
BUT including paid media cost of Google (probably YouTube only) and Facebook ads. 91k is fairly little budget to even promote a video material on social media.
So I guess that the cost of video production of the video was about 31k. Since it was proceeded through a Multi Channel Network that aggregates different YouTubers, that guy probably earned 50% of it - that is 15k PLN (4,5k USD). Not so shocking now, right?
(Of course the numbers above are based only on my professional experience are not confirmed in any way).

So the point is that many people just rants on the guy but in my opinion he didn't earn much money for that (relatively) and probably even don't support the idea. I don't say it's a good or a bad think, it's up to you.
Also, the National Bank can introduce any campaign that they want to support their claims. I think that in some way this maybe even meet with positive feedback (National Banks worries about your money).

"> yup and leaving the eu will fix that. some people... idk.

Yes, I don't get this either. Some people think that the EU has something to do with it just because the European Court of Justice, an arm of the EU, is attempting to force unwilling states like Poland to accept ""migrant"" quotas. I guess Poles really are dumb if they think there's a relationship between Poland belonging to the EU and an arm of the EU enforcing ""migrant"" quotas on Poland.

The really strange thing to me is why states like Germany, the Netherlands and France would want to send any migrants away. After all, most of the migrants are doctors and lawyers who will only benefit their society, so Poland would just be missing out on those benefits. People get distracted by incidents like the murder of Theo van Gogh, the Charlie Hebdo massacre, the Bataclan massacre, the unfortunate incidents in Nice and Berlin, the rape and murder of Maria Ladenburger, and so on. If Poles were as smart as the Germans, French and Dutch, they'd know the benefits of having ""migrants"" far outweighs a few isolated incidents like those. I mean, have Poles never tasted Middle Eastern cuisine? I think we can all agree, it's better to have a thousand Maria Ladenburgers be raped and murdered than have one fewer kebab place.";1;0;False;reovirus;duieo11;Polish Youtuber was paid ~30 000$ By Polish Bank to create FUD video about cryptocurrencies for his viewers;7ykxex;http://www.cryptovibes.com/crypto-news/youtuber-was-paid-by-polish-bank-to-slander-crpytocurrencies/
