I'm almost glad I didn't get into bitcoin before 2012 because I probably would have done something similar, except unlike you I would not be able to forgive myself lol. That is some character building stuff right there. At least you have a good attitude about it.;1;0;False;NytronX;e0k6cp1;What he would be wishing now? ðŸ˜‚;7mgy26;https://i.redd.it/shu3p1cshi601.jpg
"You're describing the intent of the law... not always the reality. 

Example:

https://web.stanford.edu/group/chr/drupal/ref/tax-deductible-property-donations-to-us-museums

>Frel appraised many of the pieces himself at inflated values to encourage donors

Donation to evade tax becomes a major issue when ""fair market value"" becomes debatable. 

The incentives can align such that it's in the charities interest to agree that what they received was worth a significant multiple of it's real value (to encourage more donation) and in the givers interest because, if the multiple is large enough, it can be used to reduce real taxes to a greater degree than the real value of the item donated. 

https://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/86/8/07-048546/en/

For example if you donate items you normally sell is the ""fair market price"" the sticker list price, the cost price or other?

So if a pharma company has drugs a few months away from expiry with a list price of X-million they can donate and then claim a ""market value"" that is far higher than their ""real"" market value... but where it's really really hard to prove in court. Production cost might be close to zero, real value might be negative due to being near expiry and cost of destruction but value claimed as a donation may be the list price per pill.  

It doesn't work so well with things like bitcoin where there's a fairly clear market price and it's hard for there to be a large enough disconnect between the realistic price you could get for exchanging bitcoins and the highest listed value on any exchange anywhere.... but there's a real phenomenon on which people's beliefs are based.

"I got a couple buddies into one project and since the market crash/pullback have been nonstop with the ""crypto is dead and I feel stupid"". The project I told them about has had a hell of a few months with new partnerships, ICO news, new Dapps, etc but they only see that the price is still lower than they bought into it. 

They clearly didnt research in depth what they invested in and now feel theres no hope. Worst part is one friend gets most of his crypto news from one of the major media outlets. Articles from CNN/MSNBC/Wall street Journals are normally dumb and basic.

Completely new to crypto. But I have a question, I see when converting from bitcoin to dollars, they can go to many many decimal places. I.E. 1 dollar = 0.00045 bitcoins. Why do you need to mine more when one can just expand on that decimal. For example: world economy ~50 trillion = 1 bitcoin. 1 dollar = 0.000000000000002 bitcoin.
