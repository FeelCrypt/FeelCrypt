Right on bro. Easier to say “give it to me for free” then to consider the cost. Yes it could probably be done cheaper, anything could. But nobody works for “almost free” why would they do it? Just to get your business? That’s about the closest you’ll get to almost free. Banks/institutions don’t need your withdrawals to make money. Just opposite, thats when they start loosing money....when your withdrawing. Otherwise they’d be charging you to deposit as as well.;1;0;False;redrider456;ej6ud6f;So you don't get robbed...;b26qxy;https://i.redd.it/riv6dcyoepm21.jpg
