I don’t get why people want these big bubbles...I understand that some lost a lot and it’s natural to want to recoup some of your losses... but it’s not a good thing if prices shoot up too high too suddenly.. just ask the folks who are down 80 percent.;2;0;False;xav--;ec5fq3v;Here we go again!

"To be fair, the explosion was pretty unprecedented. I’ve been in bitcoin for a long time, and I’ve owned bitcoin for a long time, but still managed to lose a lot of money.

I watched bitcoin go from $200 to $400 and then hang out their for a while.

Suddenly one day it’s $1000.

Then it’s $2000. By the time it reached this point, I was pretty happy with my returns and had sold the majority of my investment.

Going from $200 to 2000 seemed like exactly what you’re talking about. Surely this is the top and we should expect a reversal, especially with stocks doing relatively well as well.

But then in a blink of an eye, it’s 4000, 6000, 10,000, 16,000.

The fomo was insane. I had sold around 20 btc that I bought for somewhere between 5-10K and made roughly 40k off it, and somehow I felt terrible. “Could have paid off my mortgage.”

I sold bitcoin thinking exactly what you’re saying. This growth is unsustainable and will reverse, at which point I’ll buy more.

And it eventually did reverse, as we all know. But not until increasing another 900%.

And so when it dropped down to $10K, you bet your ass I thought i was getting a bargain. And it dropped, and I bought more, and it dropped and I bought more,  and this went on for a while.

In reality, bitcoin could have went to $100K. Hell, it still could. But don’t act like this shit is easy to predict. It’s all a gamble.";8;2;False;ninetofivedev;ec6gzco;Here we go again! Upvote to gain momentum! To the Moon! <3;a7ln25;https://i.redd.it/hul5q64x08521.gif

I had 10 btc in 2013 that I bought for ~2500 and I sold because it started crashing horribly. That investment would be worth nearly 40k today a mere 5 years later. I FOMOd back in in 2017. I may be down now but I’ve been watching this roller coaster since 2011 and fuck if I’m selling now. It’s true this is just another bubble cycle but inevitably it will skyrocket again at some point and then I’ll start selling. ;6;0;False;patrickisgreat;ec5ivyg;Here we go again!

"Yeah true I can totally understand that. Im just saying that first time buyers could have used a bit more caution especially If something has never reached that current level at such a quick pace. I’m happy that I didn’t have money to spend on the way down as I just had twins and lost our second income to my wife staying home with them. I would probably have been buying these dips on the way down.

"it's not a pump, just a bounce as sell volume fell and some buyers jumped in. keep in mind that as far as we know, we are still in a bear market. we haven't made any significant new highs for months, and there hasn't been volume to show a capitulation event.

"Okay your tone was ridiculous and everything digital is a string of 0 and 1s and there is plenty of shit you ain't allowed to have, so spare me the flowery speech.

As people figure out that blockchain sucks and cryptos are just a modern pyramid scheme, they will be banned.  The constitution doesn't gaurantee your right to hold pyramid tokens.
