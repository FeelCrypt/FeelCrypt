"Really? I can't comment on conflict areas, but tourist areas seem very well maintained. I went to Xplor and Xcaret over the winter (south of Cancun) and everything was well maintained, clean, etc. 

Xplor has a series of ziplines which were very safe, and all the operators took safety seriously. Xcaret has many performances and all were top notch. 

The grounds at the ruins of Tulum (further south from cancun) were also very well maintained. Additionally, we explored Puerto Morelos (a small beach village, not super touristy) and Playa del Carmen (moderately touristy city but mostly just along the actual coast) and never felt unsafe walking the streets as late as 1:00am. And to top it off I didn't have a single bad meal, even in the parks! Didn't even stick to typical Mexican cuisine, all the food was just tops.

"Aight so lets ballpark some numbers shall we? Lets assume a max load of a 300 pound person (although compared to the weight of the cable its not much). Judging by the cable that looks like 1"" steel cable. Fastest number I found is 1.85 pounds per foot. At 1200 meters, or 3937 feet that is 7283 pounds. We will approximate these loads combined on the cable at the midpoint, totaling 7583 pounds. 1"" steel rope has a safe working load of 16700 pounds. However this is Mexico, so lets say they have a working load of 20,000 pounds (there is little load fluctuation so this is actually not as bad as it sounds, plus the breaking load is over 80,000 lbs, still leaving a safety factor of 4) This leaves remaining tension at about 12,000 pounds. For another approximation, the sag this line had will be high too. With these ballparked numbers the angle between the midpoint horizontal and top anchor would be 30 degrees. This is reduced somewhat by having the setup overall at an angle so the person goes downhill the whole time. If we wanted an average angle of 10 degrees for instance, the line would need to have about 43,671 lbs of load. Now this is really close to the braking strength of the wire and the cable would absolutely creep (slowly deform over time) at this load. A fatter cable could be used, like 1.5 inch. To get a 10 degree average slope with 1.5"" cable (4.16 lbs/ft) you would need 96,000 pounds of tension. Either way, these numbers are crazy.

Just a ramble into what the forces might actually looks like. tl:dr somewhere between 30,000 to 90,000 lbs of tension, depending on angle and cable thickness.";80;6;False;Leehams;dvkbhl0;The latecomer’s BTC journey;83qeea;https://v.redd.it/hqzbut8or7l01

Lol, that's the downside to Mexico? I don't mean burst your bubble but the vast majority of the world does not treat dogs (or pets for that matter) nearly as well as people in the US. Most dogs in third world countries are not kept indoors, they are tied up outside or kept in cages. Keeping pets is just a part of American culture that is different than much of the world. And there is a lot worse things about MX than how they treat their dogs.

Ethereum reached a consensus to fork out of the former bad/infected chain, There for it was an agreement between the investors to vote for the changes. Calling ethereum classic the real Ethereum chain is a bit stupid since the real ethereum investors have disregarded the faulty chain and moved on to a superior chain, At least they mt.gox equilivent event of dropping some billions worth of coins tanking the market is not an option for the Eth hackers it stands in a better ground for the future than bitcoin does in its current state... If every bitcoin hacker tried to dump their shit on the exchanges btc would worth 100$ by the end of the year. That was the reason we didn't want the hacker in our ecosystem and we fork the hell out of it. We simple have to protect our investments and Ethereum at least is able to do that, I am not saying bitcoin is not any good. It did fund the Ethereum chain so we have to respect that and protect the Bitcoin as much as we did with Eth but it is a secondary now. I hope bitcoin can survive all that shit and be the coin it used to be. Eth is not made to compete any currency it is made to change the world of online payments and finance work, Bitcoin still does not know what it wants to be when it grow up, a currency or a store of value. It is good to have a business plan or at least a roadmap to where you want to be in some years from now, Bitcoin still have not figure this out. And for sure it wont going to be able to compete at smart contracts anywhere near the coming years. It is already out of the game and for me the community should really focus on making bitcoin space a bit clearer than that. When I send bitcoin from a service to my wallet I expect to get btc and not some shit forked thing I never asked for, and yes this has happened to me 1 month ago after purchasing the advcash card. No one will ever take you serious if you practice such stupid things to customers. Just saying.;1;0;False;skapaneas;dvkq9qb;Epic Fail!

The problem with this is that you are missing an opportunity to appear more reasonable to an uninformed neutral observer.  Right now, it looks like both sides are acting childishly.

"I don't believe that his 35k BTC selling could be a reason of market fall. Day volumes on large exchanges are much more than 35.000 BTC. And he sold them partically.
