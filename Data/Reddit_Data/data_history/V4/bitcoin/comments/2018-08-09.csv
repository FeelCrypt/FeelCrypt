"Browser addons can add something called ""javascript"" to your webpages, which is essentially computer speak for ""a program."" This means that if you install an addon from a sketchy publisher, they can run ""a program"" that changes what you see on your computer screen.

To make this as simple as possible, so that someone like you might have a chance at understanding it--its like someone intercepting all your mail, and changing things about it in a way you'll never notice, then delivering the mail to you again, sealed. So all your bills? The address is different, to trick you into sending money to the wrong person.

This has been done many times to popular browser addons, specifically gaming addons. Either the developer gets greedy or gets hacked, and the addon starts using malicious code to change bitcoin addresses on webpages to their own. So that eventually, when someone sends you an address, the man in the middle switches the address for a different one and you lose your money.";0;1;False;my_next_account;e3v1654;How To Invest In Bitcoin;953ays;https://i.redd.it/cd9zqif6die11.jpg

Another way of looking at going all in on risky investments is that it can either make you or break you. For most, putting only 1-5% of their networth into something that goes up 50x won't change their life really. People who go all in deserve whatever they get. If you are willing to lose it all to 50x your networth and it works out, that's awesome i mean you risked literally everything... If you're willing to lose it all to 50x your networth and it doesnt work out, also great you knew this was the risk beforehand. I would just make sure the upside is really worth it (like don't go all in on herbalife or some shit) and the other thing is that this method is probably only realistic to like 5% of the population, most people should never do it. If you are a young man or woman who doesnt have a lot or any financial obligations like debt mortgage house kids etc, these people are in a much safer place to pretty much risk everything for bigger gains. You have a lot less to lose and a lot more time to just work back whatever money you lost, sure it would suck if you lost everything and had to start over but thats pretty much the level of risk any person takes who end up making life changing amounts of money very quickly. There is definitely not a one size fits all solution how people should save and invest their money, it really depends on their over all situation and the level of risk they are comfortable taking on. But yeah many people who would qualify in that 5% who have no financial obligations rightfully would still not feel comfortable just risking it all, realistically only a very small amount of people would probably feel comfortable doing this and i say if they want to do that more power to them. but it would be pretty irresponsible for people who can't really afford to lose everything due to being in a lot of debt already or having to take care of kids and what not. ;4;1;False;chillingniples;e3wkmba;Bitcoin has stabilized?;95upw4;https://i.redd.it/0hfg960i61f11.jpg

Hence why people are drawn to gambling on speculative assets, and hindsight is 20/20 most people lost money.

Also, how is the 200K price target justified? What some guy on the internet said after spending 15 minutes making a chart based on past results?
  
There is a reason investment firms are legally obligated to say ""past performance is no guarantee of future results."" If only people on Reddit also had to say this.
  
At lot of mainstream people were involved in pushing Bitcoin to 20K, most of them bought in over 10K and got burnt badly. Crypto's market cap increased 550B in that run up in 2 months. Will people be willing to risk the amount of capital it would take to push the market up 5-6 trillion dollars to get bitcoin to that 200K target, or will they be concerned about getting burnt again and sell off well before that even if there is a significant rise. How many boom and bust cycles would it take to hit 200K and how many of those cycles will mainstream people put up with before they decide to just keep their money in an Index fund?

Finally, Bitcoin is not the only game in town. Will another technology supplant Bitcoin during that timetable. Sure you can diversify, but how much. If your target price is 10x current prices, you can invest in 5 investments, if you want to double your money, assuming the other 4 fail. If you buy in lower and now your target price is 30x current prices prices, then you can invest in 15 investments, greatly increasing your chances that one of the 15 investments meets your goal.
  
So, in conclusion, price matters a lot, no matter what your price target is, because a price target is a potential outcome, not a guaranteed outcome.";13;2;False;grengrad;e3w64dl;Bitcoin has stabilized?;95upw4;https://i.redd.it/0hfg960i61f11.jpg

Well, people thought the same thing when they bought at 30 and it droppped to 2 (June 2011), and again when they bought at 200 and it dropped to 70 (april 2013), and again when they bought at 1,100 and it dropped to 180 (2014-2015).

Sure, anyone with half a wit that's willing to do a little bit of research can quadruple their money easily in stocks during a bull market (which we've been in for the past 10 years almost). My stock portfolio has been doing great since 2008, and I too have tripled or quadrupled my investments since then. But stocks also bubble and pop. I saw people lose all the profits they made in stock investments during the 2008 recession. But regardless, my bitcoin investment has made me 250x gains in 5 years, and is at a point now where those investments will probably never be in the red again. 250x makes quadrupling look like nothing. What started as a 5% allocation of my net worth has now mushroomed into more than half of my net worth, in just 5 years.

"I am upvoting you and taking that question at face value. Because it is a hard to answer question.

Both Fiat and BTC have failing and possibilities. The government control around Fiat are double edged. It is unlikely the dollar or euro will collapse in the immediate future even if the worst happens around the current political climate in the US (and I mean worst, a full on civil war would devalue the money not collapse it). But smaller countries come and go as we have seen with Libya and Venezuela in recent years. Large governments have show incredible deftness in using their money to better their citizens' position.

Cryptocoins are so new we do not yet know all the risks and BTC has specific risks of its own. I pulled out a while ago when I thought a 51% attack was likely and now it seems very hard barring some new tech. What if Google or some research firm announces some new quantum chip that can do 50 petahashes/s. Is that likely I am not a quantum hardware engineer, so I must go with my gut and expert opinions and say this is not likely, but experts have been wrong.

It does look like BTC will appreciate with my level of experience, but then Fiat backed assets like common stock and bonds have a long history. I must admit the future is uncertain for both but the risks to are different. One has mainly political risk the other mainly technological risk.

I can't say which is more likely to collapse but I have no problem having my money split into a variety of assets I understand, some Fiat, some BTC and some durable resellable goods.

">plenty of token scams try and come up with something better on paper but so far

That's a good point: it's far easier to write down something that *sounds* better on paper, on a very high-level, that's easy to parse. It's far more difficult to actually understand the concepts behind Bitcoin to a deep enough level that you can understand the ins and outs of its strengths and shortcomings, let alone actually writing a detailed proposal for how to improve upon it.

Every single one of these alt-coins falls short of the latter. They really, *really* nail the first part: making up a high-level concept that sounds amazing. Take Ethereum for instance: it's not hard to come up with the basic idea of ""It's like Bitcoin but you can run programs on it, so you can have any kind of smart contract you want. It's also more efficient and centralized because it has PoS."" In reality, though, PoS is a pipe dream at best, and a major potential vulnerability at worst. Supporting program execution on top of a decentralized PoW system opens the door to a million potential vulnerabilities and bloating which can and will ultimately bring down the whole network.

It turns out, solving the problems of Bitcoin is *fucking hard*, and all these people claiming to have a better solution have yet to give credible proof. Because if they did actually invent something that improved upon Bitcoin, someone would just add it as a contribution to the Bitcoin repository.

Although the form factor was the same, DVD could never ""become"" Blu-Ray. It was succeeded by Blu-Ray. Bitcoin can actually become Blu-Ray, and it can later ""become"" streaming"". Bitcoin is an evolving set of technologies based on a few common concepts. Things like crypto-graphical security, decentralization, block-chain, and proof of work. All of those things are concepts realized by the software behind them. The concepts are solid. They will remain true, even when the technologies change, and Bitcoin will change to become whatever technology it needs to be.

"The reason the price drops so quickly is because whales have figured out how the game works. They buy in and inflate the price, make some profits, and then cash out. This leaves the smaller guy (us) with losses forcing us to HOLD onto our coins and salvage what we have left. This is just my opinion, but they don't care about the technology, they care about profits and they are the ones making them, while we are posting roller-coaster memes and other stupid shit in this subreddit. Bitcoin is so volatile that it allows these whales to use it to make a quick buck because they can pump and dump. Once the big ""investors"" joined the game it was over for us.

I certainly agree there.  The 2015 crash seemed to be fueled by a crisis of confidence in BTC itself.  The world's largest exchange lost almost a million BTC and China banned cryptocurrencies, so it appeared the market was doomed.  The current bear market has more to do with the shitcoin bubble popping.  I have much more confidence that BTC will survive and thrive now than I did back in 2015.

">There were not an enormous amount of transactions. That would barely register for Visa.

This has nothing to do with what I said.

Obviously it is relative. You have decided a) what enormous means and b) ignored the context, that it is within the btc transactions. At that time, an enormous amount (of the blockchain transactions) were spam in order to create the issues you are now referring to. Not ""an enormous amount of global transactions happened on bitcoin"". No idea how you got that from what I said. I never once mentioned Visa or global transaction volumes.

Segwit has and will have much of an effect.

If/when btc reached Visa levels of 'enourmous', LN will need to be there. We already know that.
