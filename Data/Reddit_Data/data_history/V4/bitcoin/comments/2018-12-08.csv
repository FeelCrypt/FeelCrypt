"Everyone that thinks it's going to the moon is just hoping for another hype bubble to happen.  Those that lost fiat bought the hype bubble.  No sympathy.  It's always been a high risk asset with no actual value attached.  Those who don't understand the risk shouldn't be investing.  

Now that said, I want bitcoin to succeed.  I think it's a real product and has a real future as a currency.  That won't happen on a widespread scale until it stops being a volatile asset people are trying to get rich on.  I would like the price to drop and stabilize.  

It's true that it's viable as a deflationary currency.  But then it's value should be far far less than where we are now.  Bitcoins deflation rate should not, cannot, be higher than every other investment.  Holding currency should not be more profitable long term than any other investment.  THAT is why there is massive risk.  THAT is why there was a bubble, and in my opinion, still a bubble.  If it doesn't stabilize and gain widespread usage, it'll continue to drop until it's worthless. 

Just my two cents.  I'm sure it'll gain all the downvotes because I want crypto to succeed and not just make me rich overnight.  ";0;0;False;Zarn520;ebbq6l9;I wonder if we upvote this, is there a chance trading bots get confused and start buying?;a44t1m;https://i.imgur.com/f6TnaFp.gif

Since 2011, it's gone up a lot more than it's gone down, so while this year has been a ""low income"" year for me compared to some previous years, it certainly hasn't been devastating.  In fact, the total value of all assets I hold now is still larger now than the total value of all assets I held in January 2018, it's just that the amount of that increase is been much less than the previous year (January to December 2017) was.";3;1;False;dalebewan;ebckduy;I wonder if we upvote this, is there a chance trading bots get confused and start buying?;a44t1m;https://i.imgur.com/f6TnaFp.gif

"Five reasons:

1. The closer you spend it to the time that you get it, the less important the volatility is.  Sure, it costs a lot more BTC now to buy groceries than it did a year ago, but I also make more BTC every paycheque, because my pay (just like the price of groceries) is denominated in euro, not bitcoin.
2. Look at the dates... I got back in to bitcoin in 2011.  Coins I acquired then are still thousands of times more valuable at the moment than when I got them.  What used to be ""leftover change"" of ""a few BTC"" is now a serious amount of money.
3. I have never engaged in speculation, trying to trade my BTC back and forth with different currencies in the hope of increasing how much I have.  I know that it's possible to make money that way, but it's also possible to lose a lot, and I suspect I wouldn't be very good at it, so would likely lose far more than I make, so I simply don't do it.
4. Although I don't see Bitcoin as an investment (but rather a currency), that doesn't mean that I don't have investments.  I own a house (no mortgage) in another country and have a portfolio of traditional stocks in companies that I both agree with morally/politically as well as see as being likely to increase in value over time (on average, they absolutely have).  If I ever find myself having a lot of money lying around (note that for me, that means BTC), I'll generally funnel it in to either these existing investments or make a new investment.
5. I have a good job (six figures p.a. in euro/dollar terms).

It was 2011 when I realised what bitcoin *really* is, but I didn't get back in to mining.  I just starting buying and using it.  In 2016, I started switching as much as possible to bitcoin as a currency and I've now only got a few things left that I need to hold fiat to pay and I'm actively working on fixing those.

(to note: I do pay for quite a lot of things with fiat out of necessity, but for the vast majority of it, it's using a credit card that I then pay off in bitcoin, so I don't actually have to *hold* fiat to do so.  When and where possible, I do *prefer* to pay bitcoin directly to someone accepting it though, so I do my best to encourage adoption.

"**Sunk cost**

In economics and business decision-making, a sunk cost is a cost that has already been incurred and cannot be recovered (also known as retrospective cost).

Sunk costs are sometimes contrasted with prospective costs, which are future costs that may be incurred or changed if an action is taken. In that regard, both retrospective and prospective costs could be either fixed costs (continuous for as long as the business is in operation and unaffected by output volume) or variable costs (dependent on volume). However, many economists consider it a mistake to classify sunk costs as ""fixed"" or ""variable."" For example, if a firm sinks $400 million on an enterprise software installation, that cost is ""sunk"" because it was a one-time expense and cannot be recovered once spent.

"Bitcoin's price as reported is arbitrary. In the code the fundamental unit is the satoshi. There is no ""bitcoin"" in the code. For cosmetic reasons only on the GUI of the original client, the decimal was placed where it is making 1btc = 100,000,000sat. And it simply became convention.

Think of it this way, if you buy $1 of bitcoin today are you buying 0.00029940 bitcoin or 29,940 satoshis? It's arbitrary where you decide to place the decimal. And thus the equivalent price is arbitrarily dependent on the units you choose to display.

You saying it's a million times overvalued is the literall equivalent of saying someone's too tall because you reported their height in nanometers. 

If you want to compare bitcoin to a stock, then you need to compare the price of the fundamental units. In terms of satoshis the price of bitcoin is $0.0000334 per today.

Personally I've been using the millibit (0.001btc = 1mBTC) for a few years because that's roughly equivalent to everyday values of things and stocks. The last ATH cycle saw the price go from $0.20 mBTC to $19 mBTC and back to $3.35 mBTC. Will we see a $100 mBTC in the future?

"I think the chances of that are close to zero (as in, less than the chance of a global financial catastrophe causing everyone to turn to bitcoin as a true safe haven; and to be honest, I don't think that's very likely either).

However even if it did happen, it wouldn't affect me financially very much.  I'd just have to stop using bitcoin and instead go back to using euro (or something else).  That's kind of the point of ""use it as a currency, not an investment"".

I believe it's a far better form of money (both ""as money"" as well as ""for the world in which we live"") and therefore I want to use it and encourage others to do so, but the sudden inability to use it wouldn't cause me any particular hardships - only a mix of sadness that such a wonderful thing has failed and annoyance at myself that it did so against all my expectations (which would mean I'd somehow failed to see/understand something, since right now, I don't see any realistic way for that to happen).";3;0;False;dalebewan;ebcl0un;I wonder if we upvote this, is there a chance trading bots get confused and start buying?;a44t1m;https://i.imgur.com/f6TnaFp.gif

It needs to stabilize a bit before that's reasonable. If I buy bitcoin (with the intent to use to pay goods), and a day later it goes down another 10%, then I paid that much in tax just to say I paid for goods and services in bitcoin. If it's converted at point of sale that's a little different, granted, but the store will just immediately convert it to USD anyway so there's little gained there except for a stat for that one company that someone paid for it in bitcoin. If things stabilize (or start going up again) then maybe it would be worth doing, but the volatility is just too crazy and all going in one direction right now.;2;0;False;SageClock;ebblnio;Embarrassed being caught in the middle;a3vodm;https://i.redd.it/99vtfrbutr221.jpg

"There is one part that is equally sad and true. Doesn't know how to read charts. Issue number one is support levels keep breaking . Issue Number 2 is people still haven't figured out how to fundamentally value the object. 

If you are going to harp on someone about something it would be applying appropriate risk management because there are thousands of broken technical patterns all over the chart. Doing that of course means you have to keep all your money on exchanges. 

Or maybe we could just be honest and admit the only thing going on right now is a little bit of bear euphoria as people race each other for the door.

"I have a vague finance background which let me get to hang with investors.

Most investment banks frown on TA although it’s a fact that 1/3 of Wall Street before 2016 used TA.

That said 70% of active fund managers failed to beat the market using active methods using either TA or fundamentals.

Passive investing in indexes (the SP500 version of HODL) seems to work better than TA.

Now there was a discussion about why this was because TA in the 1980’s was wildly profitable.

Some suspect when non institutional investors got into the scene in the early 2000’s it broke the model because they reacted to emotion based news which made chart reading ineffective and people like Vanguard were laughing at everyone by making billions with their passive investing setups.

Also TA has a bit of back tracking where people prove their future predictions right but showing how the models worked in a past instance but if you have ever read a prospectus the first thing it say is “Past performance does not guarantee future results”.

Even if the SP500 has historically went up since 1929... It may just one day fail to do so.

Not that TA can still make money but studies have show that people just flipping coins have same results in historical models.

PS The active traders who were beating markets were often doing stuff like shorts and options along side longs which the average investor has a hard time getting their head around.";2;1;False;vonFelty;ebdqtd2;State of Bitcoin;a4cyrx;https://v.redd.it/fuac4nasg3321
