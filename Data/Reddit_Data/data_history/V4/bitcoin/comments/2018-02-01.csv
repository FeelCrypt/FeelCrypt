"**Bird**

Birds (Aves) are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a strong yet lightweight skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the 5 cm (2 in) bee hummingbird to the 2.75 m (9 ft) ostrich. Birds are descendants of extinct feathered dinosaurs, making them not only the sole surviving dinosaurs according to cladistics, but ranking as the world’s most numerically-successful class of tetrapods, with approximately ten thousand living species, more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds. Birds are the closest living relatives of crocodilians

The fossil record indicates that birds evolved from feathered ancestors within the theropod group, which are traditionally placed within the saurischian dinosaurs.

Of the people who can dedicate the time and resources to monitoring markets are too overwhelmed to take informed actions based on fluctuations.

So its totally reasonable for an average Joe to just not factor opportunity costs at all, as they simply don't apply to them.

The developers here have finally worked out a way to harness the power of Ponzi schemes into a blockchain. When a new investor buy an amount of PonziCoins, the software automatically creates additional PonziCoins and sends them to the earliest investors. For instance, buy 50 PonziCoins, and the earliest 50 investors *each* receive an additional PonziCoin.

"Your statement is true, however, I think it is a relevant stat.  The reason is because as new and old investors enter this market they are continually looking for the next big thing to get those big returns.  With the alt market growing relative to Bitcoin, that is a lot of money that used to and/or would have been flowing right to bitcoin, fueling it's growth, but instead it is flowing to smaller alt coins.  The effect is Bitcoin's potential for growth is reduced overall.  That doesn't mean the trend couldn't reverse (it did this past summer!).  But I do think it is a relevant stat to keep an eye on.  However, I will say that just because that number is ""low"" doesn't mean it's going to go lower.  That makes no sense.

Good point, I would always want to keep hold of some.

"Great counterargument. Very informative. 

Buying mining equipment is tying up your assets. The nice part is that even in the event of a crash, you have assets. The spring 14 crash though, the video cards dropped in price severely, so you can still take a significant loss. I remember 290X going for $800-900 that spring and then selling for $200 after the crash.

You also have to account for the market. As your earning money in coins, if its going up you could have made out with a lot more by investing into the coins themselves, as it can take 6-8 months to recover. If it the market turns and the miner still has all his coins, then you could still be significantly negative from assets devaluation and electricity costs. 

Overall I do enjoy mining more, its an enjoyable hobby and almost a competition to improve efficiency, but it does carry risks and it can tie up your assets.

"Need might be a strong word; but to answer your question ""Why work for Bitcoin?"" it is a multi-sided answer.

Working for Bitcoin is for your own profit and peace of mind. If you believe in Bitcoins long term potential and want to invest but aren't wealthy enough to plop down $20k+ and be able to watch it swing down 80% ; working for Bitcoin is much safer and easier for peace of mind. 

The other reason that we should be ""working for Bitcoin"" is that at the end of the day human directed labor is what creates value. A growing economy of people that accept Bitcoin in exchange for their labor gives real value to the currency. Over time people working for Bitcoin translates into more goods and services being offered in exchange for Bitcoin. The more that you can buy directly with Bitcoin; the more valuable Bitcoin becomes; because you don't have to cash out to use it.

Another big reason that we should be ""working for Bitcoin"" is because that is necessary for the End-Game.

Bitcoin will always be mined (at least for another 100+ years). There will always be a downward pressure on the price from new coins entering circulation. Although inflation as % of market reduces enormously over time; there is still a downward pressure on price from new coins. The goal in the end game is that those working for Bitcoin create the real value in the world that is represented by the new coins minted by miners.

Wealth/value doesn't come from thin-air. Money represents the real value in the world. The more people that exchange their goods and labor for Bitcoin the more valuable the entire concept becomes.

Bitcoin gained in price over 2017 ; but not significantly in value. Bitcoin had been massively undervalued and 2017 was a bit of new price discovery. 

As Bitcoin becomes more ingrained and integrated into the internet and global economy its real value will grow. History has shown us that the price does not keep even step with the networks value. The price goes long periods being undervalued; then moves up sharply a few legs; then moves up asymptotically; then crashes down 50-80%. While it is crashing down in price; network value grows; and then it suddenly starts popping in the other direction.

A lot of the timing of these events I believe is correlated strongly to the halving events. The past does not predict the future; but thus far the insane % gains have all started ~6months post halving.

Regardless bitcoin is the most trusted,tested, and attacked crypto which still makes it the safest crypto to park money. Other coins simply are at the idea stage or barely tested. By the time they actually start getting more volume and more devs behind these alt coins, bitcoin is still improving. 

TL;DR: Its like a space race but even if bitcoin loses, it will still be the first crypto ever made.

"Do you actually believe that most people here are ONLY watching or investing in Bitcoin? Hell, the massive bitching about GPU prices should tell you that isn't the case. I personally have a decent position in ETH myself. 

Bitcoin is kind of like the Dow in that it's what people use as a general guide to the overall crypto space. Very few people that aren't just following the trend are only dealing in BTC. As with any investment, whether it be stocks, Forex, or cryptos, it's extremely naive and short sighted to not diversify.

Also, I'm so incredibly tired of hearing random FUD based on literally nothing (and stupidly incorrect), not just from the Wall Street people who will do anything to keep their ""fake money"" (stocks) as the only investment vehicle but from random people on the Internet for god knows what reasons. There is no history or even trend to support what your $1k claim and saying it only serves to scare people who don't know better so why would you say it? Why would you even believe it? Is it just fear?

I could see the price go all the way back to above $20k in the next 90 days. That's a pretty baseless claim too except those kind of jumps, based on percentage of growth, have actually happened unlike your absurd $1k claim. Could it happen? Of course, anything is possible. BTC and all cryptos are high risk and volatile so they could drop to less than $.01 in a few days but they probably wont. On the other hand, how's Blockbusters' stock doing?

"Market cap is basically just measurement of cost per share * number of shares. You have the market cap of an individual coin as well as market cap of all coins put together. 

The issue is that this number is misleading due to low liquidity.

Say you have 10 shitCoinX. There are only 100 shitCoinX in circulation and the current price it's being traded for is $10 per coin. The market cap would appear to be 100 * $10 = $1000.

It is misleading to assume that all coins can be sold to produce a total value transfer into some other form of $1000. If the moment you sell your coin, the only buy order for 1 shitCoinX at $10 was filled, this would be the equivalent of low liquidity. The next buy order is $9.50 for 1 coin and so on and so forth. When you sell all your coins, the market drops as a whole. So the next evaluation of market cap will be 100 shitCoinX * $6.50 (only $650!) not to mention that you never got your theoretical $100 for your sell order of 10 shitCoinX. 

This is why it's important to not think of market cap as the total wealth available in an asset. 

Now, in an extremely high volume (think of it as trades per second) and low volatility (buy and sell orders are clumped up around one stable number region. Any order that diverges too far is either never met or instantly purchased and doesn't affect market), you WOULD be able to cash out all your coins because your trades get lost in the great river of wealth transfer. 

My point is that be cautious on what numbers you use to calculate the ""value"" part of an asset. This goes beyond cryptos, it applies to any form of tradeable asset. If you only use the current market value, it is not guaranteed to be accurate.

"Quite the opposite actually I called them out on it then too but I wish I did invest in amazon when they first came on the scene but an ""everything store"" sounded weird.  

In the grand scheme of things, everything we do is a gamble - like driving to work, but that's not what I'm talking about.  

If I put my money on a coffee shop, I know something about it.  I know what the traffic in that area is, what my own motivation is, what exactly I will be selling etc.  If I invest in google, I kind of know what their track record is, their products,users, what I personally think of their products and services, etc.   Yes, there is risk but I can look at the data and make the decision to see whether it's worth the risk.  

With crypto, there is no data other than what the past value and trading was.  I know you like to think there is and people who make the real money off this (ie. the middlemen) will show you fancy graphs, etc. but there is nothing in the data that gives you any idea whether the money you put in will actually gain in value or not, because YOU and your speculation are the product. 

It used to be people bought bitcoin to actually use for purchases or as a novelty but now most people are buying it strictly with the belief that it will go up in value and no other reason.  That is a house of cards if history is any indication.

Anyway, it's your money so I'm not going to tell you what to do but I gave my opinion and you asked me to explain so here I am.

Come on guys , stop to panic, when I read some comments I feel the fear and I see 2 explanations. Either you bet your house on it and for sure you'll be afraid to loose in which case your move was no wise . You really should keep a bit of money here and there but not 90% of all you have or even worse , borrowed money . Or you put the right amount at risk but you are afraid to loose . In both cases you have to learn and change .  Invest only what you can loose and learn to loose in glory )) After all the money is not our life there things more important to loose and for them be more concerned .

"Bitcoins has always had big swings; in both directions. Very difficult to predict timing or magnitude. These facts formed my investment strategy and it has made the investing part very easy. Regular scheduled buys for a set dollar amount. Small enough that it doesn't affect my lifestyle; but big enough that it adds up over time. 

Of course when the price tanks its not fun to see your portfolio go down ; but since it just slowly accumulates its not nearly as gut wrenching as investing $20k+ all at once and watching it dwindle to $5k.

People need to stop ""investing"" in Bitcoin and start ""working"" for Bitcoin.

Don't put your savings into Bitcoin; put extra income that would go to unnecessary things into Bitcoin. Instead of getting that snack; put it towards BTC. Instead of drinking put that money towards BTC and invest your extra time and energy into yourself. Instead of getting lunch; brown bag it and put that money towards BTC.

Take the money you would normally waste on items that give your life little or no meaning (or even negatively impact your life) and put it in Bitcoin instead. Don't take out loans, Don't take out (or neglect) your savings. 

Don't invest in Bitcoin; Work for Bitcoin.";211;15;False;45sbvad;dtkhr5o;Looking at the price when you invested only what you can afford to lose;7uhyy5;https://i.redd.it/7n1u6eu21ld01.jpg

It may have originated the Blockchain, but since then it has evolved and other coins (Ethereum) have become the new standard for the technology. 

I switched over my BTC to ETH yesterday as it’s become clear to me that ETH is becoming the new standard.

"The underlying problem in all of bitcoin became exposed in your comment, and that is - How to evaluate crypto currency - as an inherently valuable-technology -basically fixed value commodity, or as a technology whose value is arbitrary and linked to the variable laws of supply and demand such as Facebook or any other company people are trying to quantify. 

How do you know both the inherent value AND the variable value aren’t massively overpriced for bitcoin. For one, we can extrapolate that the inherent value is unlikely to be higher than $9,000.00 because there are competitors that can function very simialrly, and are not valued at $9,000.00. This means that we evaluate bitcoin by some nominalizarion of value - it is based in supply and demand variations. No one really knows why the price is what it is, or why it’s there, for all we know the actual value of a crypto (not just bitcoin) may reach an equilibrium just like any other commodity. The value of all tvs fall on a discrete range. Same with produce, or gum. 

The ultimate point is that these commodities invoke a reflective quantification of the costs. Tvs require, solid inputs like steel and plastic, intangibles like marketing and sales, and storing. These items have the benefit of the markets equalizing over time. Same goes with peoduxe, shipping costs are going to stay fairly structured by weight, barring some massive change. 

Crypto doesn’t posses these equilibriums yet. We don’t know if the true value of producing and competing with crypto is worth more or less yet. For all we know, the true cost, from creation to possession is worth 100k a coin or is not much different than any randomly selected commodity and will be worth $50 a coin. That’s the problem.

"The reason why crypto is falling most likely because it was overvaluated, the market is full of people who dont have any clue what they are doing and how any markets work.  Even if this market would trade in potatoes people with skills in market trading would come out winners and people without those skills would come out loosers... want it or not crypto is just another market where regular market rules start to work when people start to trade.

And at the end of the day, things is what they are not what we want them to be. And just because the technology is cool doesnt mean it will save the world and make eveyone rich. Rememmber the “dot com” bubble.

Guys let's face it, BTC was a bit of an artificial hype . Why ? Well if you remember the rally started with the free cash from the forks . All the altoins were down and only BTC was up. Not bad, 1 BTC gives you for free bunch of nice and lovey coins while many others were offering nothing big. Now the free cash party a bit over (which also damaged slightly the image of BTC ) and Wall Street involved and more and more games in place that I have no clue about but where all the parties are looking to dive the price down . I believe it will drop quite a bit but then there will be more of an organic long term growth that for me would make more sense . 10K for 1 BTC was a bit too much to digest for some who missed the boat.

Panic and sell?  The opposite counts too.  Say it hits 8.5, you don't buy, then it starts going back up, it hits 9, do you accept that you missed the chance and jump in or do you say 'I'll wait...' then watch as it maybe goes back up to 10, 11, 12, etc. then be exactly like the guy that said he sold at $700, kept waiting to buy in, finally bought in at 18.5k. 

Tl;dr - Do you believe long term that it is going to be worth something, or worth nothing?  If you believe nothing - then don't buy at that price you had in mind.  If long term, you believe it's going to be higher - quit trying to time the market, timing the market almost never works for most people, and you probably will not be the exception, just don't spend more than you can lose if you are wrong.";22;0;False;ualdayan;dtl4kpt;Buyers and sellers today.;7ujhsh;https://i.redd.it/333nv3s4emd01.gif

The poster i was originally responding to was not just talking about selling to diminish loss. He was talking about buying and selling, depending on the perceived price trend, which is exactly what trading is and would make you rich if it was easy because you'd always maximize your gains and minimize your losses.;1;1;False;steuer2teuer;dtk99ej;It's official! 1 Bitcoin = $10,000 USD;7u4tnh;https://giphy.com/gifs/curbyourenthusiasm-l1J9yTco40EU5JzTW

"No. Just buy high sell low. This market is irrational. All patterns are useless. Bad news are unrelated to the market. 

Korea for example took down the market 40%. No pattern no nothing. Just a crash. This is not a science. Just a bunch of greedy people trying to get rich quick.

All that pseudo science is pointless. By the time you have a pattern it s too late anyway. Just stick to your rules.";1;0;False;;dtk2scd;It's official! 1 Bitcoin = $10,000 USD;7u4tnh;https://giphy.com/gifs/curbyourenthusiasm-l1J9yTco40EU5JzTW

I personally believe Bitcoin paved the way to greater things but won't be the end-of-all currency.

"There s nothing technical. There is FOMO phases and FUD. Technical people invest in stocks. What technical analysis can you make of a currency ? EUR/USD for example. 

FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt) makes it go down. Basically any news that makes weak investors sell. 

FOMO (fear of missing out) makes it go up. Basically greed.

They go in cycles. Every day it goes up and down. That s why even if bitcoin goes up 4% (example figure) in a week you may make 25% (example figure) day trading. It s not hard.

"Only if you sell right now. The point is that with DCA, you only need the price to reach around $12k and you can sell everything and break even.

With that one btc purchased at $19,500, you need the market to go up almost 100% to break even.
