That moment of regret is true but well it is never too late to invest in btc or any cryptocurrency for that matter. I myself have encountered that scenario and somehow regretted but still am here and supporting [projects/platforms](https://www.contentos.io/?utm_source=lx) which I think is beneficial for me and people who has the same goal or intention. So atleast its better late than never right?;2;0;False;klaudiaschulz;exbv7jv;Reminder;cpb6co;https://i.redd.it/rrk1ulea80g31.jpg

Sad how this turns out. See how easy it is to ruin a country that doesn't care about the economy and the people in it. Ignorance is scary and can really turn a whole.country upside down, that's why I don't just rely on just the currency now but I always explore and look for ways on how to expand my resources. The fact there are digital currencies and how it can help the society in any transactions, making our lives easier. No corruption and everything is systemically accurate. There are blockchain platforms/projects that I love like [this one](https://www.contentos.io/?utm_source=lx) and can really help bridge gap to both parties hopefully that happens every country so we can avoid these types of things especially if the government is.corrupt and all.;1;0;False;klaudiaschulz;exbwgjn;Venezuelans are just throwing money on the streets now...;b02l34;https://i.redd.it/5l08hy28rll21.png
