"This reminds me of this one Android app that used to exist called Coin Tapper. How it worked was that you click a button and you get a small amount of Satoshi. You could click the button a limited amount of times in a day but you didn't have to wait between button presses.

The app had ads which I believe were supposed to appear every time you pressed the button, however since I had AdAway installed, no ads appeared at all so I could just spam click the button to get a bunch of Satoshi in one go.

The app shut down at one point though so I guess other people were abusing that lol.";2;0;False;Sonickyle27;e6bbp4c;When you finally mine 0,0003 Bitcoin after one month.;9h8lui;https://v.redd.it/8s55opst59n11

"A smidge off-topic, but you might enjoy something I've been working on. As a learning experience, I've been developing a miner for 0xBitcoin that's easy to use- point and click, no command-line interface. It's probably the closest thing to mining Bitcoin when it was new, using a typical gaming computer. What I'm going for is to make mining less difficult to get started with. If you've got an nVidia GPU, maybe give it a look. I've got no plans on getting rich from crypto, but it is a lot of fun.
