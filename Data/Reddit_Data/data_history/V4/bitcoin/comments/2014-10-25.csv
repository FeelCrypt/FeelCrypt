Food for thought : When you are dealing with a machine that is breaking down, and is several thousand miles away, a company might just have a machine local to them  ( say in their tech shop ) that they use to try to re-create the problem and work towards solving it regardless if the machine that had the issue is on , off, in transit or halfway around the world. Anyone consider that? ;1;0;False;altoidaddict;cljnkox;The Great Robocoin Rip-off: How we lost $25,000 buying a Robocoin ATM;2jakg4;https://docs.google.com/a/metalabdesign.com/document/d/1aL_b_Eq6WKv_u_ZKiPNPBXz5UbuMhi2Xm1AjdsgVER4/pub
In reality he did get it up and running, and admitted it. The unit was tested prior to being shipped. and there is so much more to the story if people only cared to do a little investigating, a couple of phone calls, and some handshakes in person. You were given 1/2 of the story and a heavily edited one at that.
