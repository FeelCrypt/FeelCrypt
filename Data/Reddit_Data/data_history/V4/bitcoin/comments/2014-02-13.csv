be very careful with tigerdirect and bitcoin. i had placed an order with bitcoin and it took 9 days to get to my house after paying for 3 day and the item was broke/not working so i returned it for refund. that was on the 7th and i still have no clue how i will be refunded. i was told gift card, then i was told on the website to call and verify info. while on the phone after being sent to 4 different departments i was told i would receive bitcoin to my wallet and to email my bitcoin address. ok i did that and the next day i was told i didn't need to send an address i was going to get a gift card.... which i still haven't gotten because the refund process hasn't finished even thought the website specifies up to 5 business days. today was 5 business days and still no idea when i will get refunded;1;0;False;dgunn4u;cfeotiz;TigerDirect.com now accepting Bitcoin!!;1vyazz;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1vyazz/tigerdirectcom_now_accepting_bitcoin/
