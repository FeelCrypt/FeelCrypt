This was technically the easiest trade in history because everybody knew that 5000 was going to be a huge psychological level similar to 3000 but worse, i even called 4950 and im not a good trader at all, it was just obvious. The way i look at it is that:- on the way up your increasing your fiat position so hodling works, on the way down tho you should be trying to increase your bitcoin position.  Easier said than done I know but thats why I say that 5000 barrier was an obvious high risk pop location so selling around 5000 was less risky than selling, for example, when it hit 3950 and kept going.  If we ever get close to $10,000 selling at 9900-9950 is a potential low risk high reward trade that may only come around once in a blue moon but I believe worth risking bitcoin capital to find out.;1;1;False;MANISHERE;dn1ph0v;Probably JP Morgan;709hed;https://i.redd.it/iqpmt8c4i1mz.png

No doubt in my mind that a huge crash in crypto isn't very far off. I say that as somebody who believes strongly in the future of cryptocurrencies. I've been watching this sub for a while and it's very clear that many people think that just because crypto has a strong future that the value will overall continue to rise as it has done despite its volatility.

Most get it the second or third time: just buy now (cost average on couple of month) and just hodl. Nothing more simple and still very very good results if you hodl long enough (seems so until now)

"The simplistic view is in thinking that government regulation costs only the cost of administration. It is in not seeing the market order and emergence of money through coordination problems. It is in thinking that what we currently see in terms of the lack of market discipline and insurances and audits, is a product of inevitable market failure, rather than the crowding out and stifling influences and regulatory uncertainty which governments have brought to bear on crypto markets. It is in thinking that giving government control won't just further advantage entrenched interests, who are already institutional and have shown over decades, centuries to be untrustworthy, or rather, have the wrong incentives in order to be trustworthy...whereas even in these stifled crypto markets (where government has already failed or refused to protect property rights) we at least see money leaving weaker hands, into the hands of people who know how to invest and build things for society.

At the end of the day, what's fair is for people to suffer these trading losses, just as much as its fair for others to gain.  The opportunity cost is not simply a more fair and regulated marketplace...with no other costs but some SEC or FINRA administration... Just one of the real costs would be to potentially lock development of bitcoin, such that it is stuck as a speculative asset and nothing more...and thus eventually withers and dies.

Obama created a college and health industry bubble, bombed more people than Bush, and spent more than every president before him combined.

Bernie ran on the idea of ""free everything,"" ""eating the rich"" and ""too many choices"" which is completely insane, then he took the campaign money he raised and bought a vacation home. Gary Johnson is an idiot. Hillary is a complete psychopath with a political career that consists of insane amounts of bribery, covering for rapists, and a pile of dead bodies. Does anything even need to be said about Trump? The media attacks Trump for being impolite and praises him for bombing people.

Forced funding can never fuel anything but corruption. Good ideas do not require force. Bitcoin has the potential to make many forms of mass forced funding a thing of the past - and that is why it is so important and revolutionary. And the most beautiful thing is, the average person will be incentivized by financial gain to contribute to anarcho-capitalist goals whether they agree to the or not.

"China announced they giving the other 2 major exchanges until end of Oct since they weren't doing the same stuff BTCC was.

Just be ready for another ""crash"" mid-Oct. Prepare to HODL again.

I'm more of a short term guy cuz I need the cash flow so I sold at $3750 this morning, it did go to $3850 but its back to $3600-3650 now.

I would suspect a semi-healthy market (could even bump up over $4k again) until mid-Oct when it's only 2 weeks away from the exchanges closing, just like this monthm 2 weeks out from BTCC closing we had a big dip, imagine when 2 more exchanges are nearing closure.

Am I saying that BTC gonna crash BELOW $3k? Maybe not, but if you don't think there won't be any dip at all when 2 more exchanges near closure you are crazy!

Long story short is to either HODL past Oct31st, or sell now and buy back mid-Oct.

">The point of this exercise is to prove to you there is nothing ""intrinsic"" about the value of bitcoin

I agree that it's value is subjective, and I think there is a good 10% chance that bitcoin becomes worthless in the next few years.  That's why I don't invest any more money in it than I can afford to lose.

>You have to admit the current price of bitcoins is super inflated due to speculation, and it's true value is somewhere back to its price around 2011-2012.

I don't think we will know bitcoins true value until we see it play a role in the coming repeat of the 2008 banking crisis.  You have to admit that 2008 was a disaster that some people saw coming but which the masters of the banking system either couldn't or wouldn't act to prevent. Yes the current system has vast resources committed to it, but it's an unstable system and governments have no hope of fixing it.

I give bitcoin an 80% chance of being the crypto currency that forces governments to stop playing with fire (fractional reserve banking).

Governments had a lot of resources invested in the mainstream media, but look what social media has done to it.  Its not the lever of power it used to be. Neither will money be.

"**Hyperinflation in Zimbabwe**

Hyperinflation in Zimbabwe was a period of currency instability that began in the late 1990s shortly after the confiscation of private farms from landowners, towards the end of Zimbabwean involvement in the Second Congo War. During the height of inflation from 2008 to 2009, it was difficult to measure Zimbabwe's hyperinflation because the government of Zimbabwe stopped filing official inflation statistics. However, Zimbabwe's peak month of inflation is estimated at 79.6 billion percent in mid-November 2008.

In 2009, Zimbabwe stopped printing its currency, with currencies from other countries being used.

**Inflation**

In economics, inflation is a sustained increase in the general price level of goods and services in an economy over a period of time. When the price level rises, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services; consequently, inflation reflects a reduction in the purchasing power per unit of money –  a loss of real value in the medium of exchange and unit of account within the economy. A chief measure of price inflation is the inflation rate, the annualized percentage change in a general price index, usually the consumer price index, over time. The opposite of inflation is deflation.

">  of a huge rally 

What would a huge rally signify?

I can think of two causes for a big rally:
1. More people speculating.
2. More people seeing it as a safe haven for their wealth.

If it's more speculation, then to me that means people are buying BTC with fiat now so they can sell the BTC at a higher price for **more fiat** later. So who exactly is getting the middle finger?


As for it being a safe haven, the way BTC is right now, I don't think the average Joe sees BTC as a safe haven (I think I'm fairly average). It's way too volatile. I mean I suppose you could put your life savings into bitcoin, but you wouldn't sleep too soundly at night!

Is there a third cause I'm not thinking of?

"While QE, in moderation and precisely applied by publicly accountable banks, is an important tool in the monetary policy toolbox, it would be unwise to do away with it. However, if blockchain technology and some mix of cryptocurrencies were to render international banks from fractional lending, I would sacrifice to the old gods and life a life of happy quiet penitence...  

What I'm saying is that since there is no such thing as inherent value and all value is perceived, all value is not objectively backed by any inherent thing and is therefore fiat. Bitcoin can't be ""better"" than fiat in a general sense, nor can anything be better in the general sense than any thing else for that matter, because ""better"" and ""worse"" are one dimensional measurements of value, and perceptions of value are always in the context of the perceiver, the need, the activity, and those are rarely one dimensional. It can be almost universally perceived as being ""better"" than fiat in specific senses, such as at doing the various things it was designed to do better than fiat, such as transfer stores of value on a much less easily manipulated ledger than fiat at current, and transfer without a bank or money service as a third party (the idea that bitcoin doesn't need a third party to trust is false - There's OS and software and hardware designers and manufacturers, ISPs, and the safety of the cryptography transcrypting everything). But even then nothing about that makes it universally and objectively ""better"" at doing that one particular thing in that one particular context - just largely perceived as better, and only by those who know what the hell they're perceiving in the first place. 

No utility or functionality or scarcity adds inherent value, and no value is universal. Bitcoin's source of value and the nature of its value is no different than fiat's source of value and the nature of its value, because the source of all value is the belief that whatever hodgepodge of emotional attachment, beliefs of the value of utility or profitability, or something else entirely, gives it any value. They're no different in that their value is perceived, and that it is perceived in context. Bitcoin's capabilities certainly hold less value to technophobes far more content with their organic trust networks than with learning something new that solves problems they don't perceive to have or are more okay with than it does to tech-savvy people devoted to revolutionizing third-party accountability. 

To me, in the context of wanting big gains in my investments to make up for being just above homeless and not having had an opportunity to create a sizeable fund to trade with yet also not wanting to do wage work until I die at 65, being generally of the idea that Satoshi will be to recordkeeping and secure transactions what Newton was to physics and calculus and thus warm to the technology despite the community, and being of the sense that the bitcoin reserve currency market is larger and more robust than the Ethereum or Litecoin reserve markets will translate to an easier time trading, and being that I am still a bit more intimidated by Ether's gas and data and smart contract stuff than I am at the price of one BTC, that therefore, to me, in this context, bitcoin's perceived value is greater than fiat. Change any of those variables and the whole thing is out the window. 


So... tl;dr I guess is that I'm suggesting that since everyone will perceive the merits of fiat and bitcoin differently in the context of what they perceive as meritous, necessary, or valuable in the myriad parts of their life, there's nothing universal about their value, and therefore bitcoin can't be better in a general sense, though it can be better in some specific circumstances. 

In the words of one of one of my trans church congregants, ""Better and worse are for absolutists and people that think their opinion and God's absolute truth are one and the same; the only thing that exists is 'different'"".

Thus *you believe* that these technical capabilities give it value. The only value is perceived value, and there's nothing inherent in Bitcoin's blockchain being capped at a certain amoung or it being nearly impervious to external attack (as opposed to internal attack and fraud, which are ubiquitous and rampant and somewhat welcomed as an exercise in 'cleansing the weak') that requires a universal or even general belief that that property gives it value, or that it gives it any commonly perceived amount of value. There's no such thing as inherent and all value is perceived and taken on belief. To those who understand, feel they have need of, and can effectively and profitably utilize the capabilities of the technology in whatever their endeavors are, there is value perceived in its utility to them in their case, and their ability to find value in the capabilities of the technology in their case does more often than not spread the perception of greater value. But if nobody saw utility in it, or felt that said endeavorers utilizing the technology did not mean that there was value in it, it would have no value or close to no value broadly.

While I agree that FRL is a monstrous way to add money to an economy and having a private, unaccountable central bank that has preyed on the USA, The Bundesbank is a public central bank and the euro and before it the deutschemark were fiat, and The Federal Reserve says fuck all about their having value, it's people tendering their debts with dollars and accepting certain amounts of value, measured as price, as the cost they associate with whatever they are receiving in return for their tender. The price of any currency is the sum of the debts tendered in it and the price people will exchange it for on the forex. If scarcity compared to demand created any sort of inherent value, diamonds would be cheap and ubiquitous, and commodity crops would be more valuable than gold. But they don't, because there's no such thing as inherent. All value is perceived. This is why there was no point in tethering one unit of perceived value to the physical scarcity of another unit of perceived value, regardless of the fact that is has a history of being regarded as having value. It's redundant, continually creates zero-sum games and hoarding, never creates stable prices outside of government price controls, like the USG just saying that 1 oz of gold is $35 as there is nothing inherent about the property of money or of gold that makes this price set true, and allots disproportionate socioeconomic power to those with enough of whatever the scarce resource is to hold economies hostage, as is what happened with five nations withdrawing their gold reserves and nearly plunging the US economy back into depression (the Nixon shock was the worst of all possible ways to deal with it, but it was still a problem that had to be dealth with and right then and there). That's precisely why Bretton-Woods failed, why no natural price equilibrium has ever actually existed, and why monetary policy has replaced currency reserves - there's no such thing as inherent value. ;1;0;False;;dn0nso1;Governments/Banks vs Bitcoin.;7000xh;https://i.redd.it/1ui0rr23hplz.jpg

"Even though banks are the most eager adopters of the technology and the cryptocurrency market cap is as high as it is because of banks and big money investing, but ok. 

Bitcoin is capped at 21 million coins to create artificial scarcity and access is restricted to having to go through and pay fees to exchanges or learning how to mine (wanna talk about something with next to no value these days...) or some other way of interfacing with the blockchain. That is also, and seemingly ubiquitously ignored, access restricted to those with access to electronics and the Internet, and the funds to buy bits. And all of this is restricted by the sustainability of the complex harmony of the dance all of the ISP backbones, all of the electronic devices and their programmers and designers, all of the public infrastructure and public policy across which transactions between individuals can occur, which is no mean feat, for any of this technology to exist or be widely adopted and used in the first place. 

This is the view of those that see any public agent or bank, no matter what fraud and scam they are trying to stop, as monolithically evil and incapable of said help, and any paranoid ancap, no matter how much enabling of theft, fraud, money laundering, tax evasion, and erosion of trust they engender, as inherently good and those aforementioned things as more impossible and more the result of the Other's outside interference at a distance the closer one gets to the religious apotheosis of complete self-worship anti-community agorism. 

In reality, most humans have readier access to cash, barter, and local escrow and holding services, and are at a lower rate of misjudging common perceptions of reputation and falling victim to fraud or theft, especially in the OECD nations, than they would in the cryptocurrency ecosystem as it is, given the proportion of theft and fraud relative to the age and size of the community, and of the eagerness of the community to victim blame and resist implementing organic means of trust, accountability, and recompense, so even if they have to go through your evil apple banker they still have a good chance of getting and keeping their apples or getting compensated in case those apples are swindled.

It's not denying the fundamental basis of how economies work, because economics is a philosophy, not a science. It's denying the assumption of neoclassical economics that supply and demand are universally objectively understood, that value is inherent since these things are objective, and that individual agents, being rational calculators of objective information regarding the value of a supply of something relative to its demand, will spontaneously generate ideal price equilibriums.  The only people left defending it are those made rich and powerful by the imbalances and externalities resulting from its utilization by economic policymakers and its autistic view of human relations that conveniently excludes those very externalities that prove exception to the 'rule', and those who cannot let go of a continental philosophy of positivistic, objective, mechanistic model of human behavior crafted almost entirely in reaction to the preceding medieval normative and generally pessimistic model of human behavior, centuries before psychology, sociology, and neuroscience showed human nature to be far different and much more complicated and less monolithic than what the likes of Thomas Paine, John Locke, Fernand Braudel, John Stuart Mill, and the Ronald Reagan of Enlightenment economic philosophers, Adam Smith, could ever have hoped to conceive.

With 2nd layer scaling and efficiencies in the base layer, Bitcoin can rival VISA at fractions of the cost. The way you look at it is like the internet in 1990 and saying it can never be used for transmitting HD video. It will evolve and 2nd layer solutions will solve the scaling issues we currently have. Lightning Network is already developed and is in the starting phase of implementation.

The real interest rate is what matter, as the nominal is just a currency distortion. Deflation is generally viewed with disfavor because it is associated with recessions when prices are falling because of lack of demand and I suppose that is the actual definition of deflation and not a currency that appreciates. That is not the case with a currency that appreciates due to scarcity. We have never before had a currency in existence that has not been constantly devalued. Banks don't usually lend in a deflationary environment because the deflation is caused by a recession and not as previously mentioned and these are very important distinctions.";1;0;False;redder32;dn0xi43;"""My memory is failing, was it Bitcoin or was it JP Morgan that was bailed out by the government?""";6zpzdp;https://twitter.com/ErikVoorhees/status/907679079469654018

"Yes because MSNB and CNN are so unbiased.

How can you support bitcoin yet be against libertarianism? Can you see how only paying attention to one side of the story can be dangerous?

It's hilarious. You guys have your religion and anything which challenges it is like holy water on a demon! You cannot stand reading or viewing anything which may logically be against your viewpoints because then your ego risks losing control over your bias! It's a protection mechanism which serves to weaken the logical part of your brain because it threatens your beliefs which serve your ego and your puny microscopic self esteem which clings onto it so dearly because it has nothing else.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subnetwork

I may have been slightly ineloquent in my description of Mcafee's project but it was **not** an attempt to sound smart, condescending, or smug **like you are trying to do.** A  subnet *mask* is basically an IP address for a subnet and in an interview Mcafee said he was trying to build a private network, or sub-network, or *subnet...* ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°...  as an alternative to *tor.*  So in fact Mcafee may be creating a Subnet mask for us to type into our browsers to access his sub network. Make sense?

Do you understand how a network works? You are part of the local network which connects to a bigger network which connects to an even bigger network. Mcafee is or was planning on creating a large private network which *sub*verts the usual networks which we and allows you to communicate with others on the network without sending packets through the usual internet. I know that subnet is usually reserved for a specific part of internet infrastructure but thats why i said the word private in front of it. I don't claim to be an IT expert with years of experience but I still dont think its a completely inaccurate description for what I was trying to describe

"None. I said it almost does although maybe that was ineloquent of me but I wanted to avoid typing what i am going to type next to explain my feelings around the subject. Lets be honest the world is not black or white. And although I want rules that act as a deterrent to violent criminals, if one of my loved ones committed a crime I wouldn't want them imprisoned. I am not autistic so I have human emotions and human bias so if someone killed a person's dog and was general asshole and someone shot them (especially if they shot them under adverse circumstances like they were drunk) I would think it's bad but I may not develop resentment towards the murderer. I also strongly believe in forgiveness and what Jesus had to say about how forgiving a person is much better than hating them. I could even forgive satanic pedophiles like Hillary Clinton if they repented for their crimes and they could possible do more good in the world if they were alive. I have also been friends with literal murderers that spent time in prison for their crime and those people were some of the nicest that I have met in my life, but it doesn't change the fact that the original violent act was wrong, just my feelings around it. 

**Did you listen to the interview with Mcafee?** Listen to it. Doesnt sound like he is guilty at all and it's proven that the Belezean government has tried to kill him 3 fucking times, so how much of a stretch is it to imagine they may have killed his dog in an effort to smear his name (which they have done also in other ways in the media) and link him legally to a murder?

Why do you want to believe Mcafee murdered his neighbor? Why do you not like him? Why do you want him to be a monster instead of man? So you can dehumanize him like *a dog*?

"> Care to actually discuss these things?

Sure.

> What use will an internet kill switch be when there will be internets outside of the internet that the government doesn't have a kill switch for?

Do you know what [peering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peering) is? Your ISP doesn't just randomly bounce TCP packets around and hope they eventually reach their destination. All traffic is passed through a VERY small amount of [IXPs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_exchange_point) and networks. It doesn't matter if the Internet in India or Germany is working. If the US Govt. tells all the US ISPs to stop network traffic then nothing gets in or out.

>How would things change if there was a pro-Bitcoin majority in government?

Bitcoin was an experiment cooked up by the NSA/CIA to see what would happen to a cryptocurrency in the wild. (Proof? Who is Satoshi?) It's been a great success. Now, the Federal Reserve is [thinking](https://www.coindesk.com/federal-reserve-paying-attention-blockchain/) about getting into the game. Some day, the major banks will issue a new type of ""FedCoin"" and make all other cryptocurrencies an instrument of terrorism. You will get a 100% premined coin from the likes of [JP Morgan](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/barbarians-gate-jp-morgan-bitcoin-driven-payment-revolution-1460765) and [Citibank](https://news.bitcoin.com/four-banks-create-new-digital-currency/). Your current cryptos will instantly become illegal and/or worthless.

>Do you think a government could kill Bitcoin? If so, how?

Declare it to be illegal and used for Terrorism. They tell all US banks to stop doing business with exchanges that sell Bitcoin. The IRS goes after anyone using it in the USA. They tell the ISPs to traffic shape all public ports used for Bitcoin and block DNS of anything that looks like a Bitcoin Exchange.

"No one knows for sure if it will keep appreciating (I agree with you, but you can't know for certain). And again they're not overpaying, *you* are talking from a holding and speculative point of view. 

There actually is value in using it as a means of exchange.  

Say btc is the best option for a person to purchase an item. If they purchase said item and get what they wanted, that they would otherwise not have been able to do without btc. Is that silly? I mean they didn't ""lose"" anything. 

>Thus until bitcoin stabilizes, it can not act as a currency...

This doesn't make sense. It most certainly can act as a currency, and actually is right now for some people. It just isn't as stable as you're point of view thinks a currency should be.

And lastly, wouldn't more people ***using it as a currency*** actually be one of the main factors that would make it appreciate, since it would be fiat flowing in and out to make purchases, essentially?

"**Internet kill switch**

An Internet kill switch is the cybercrime and countermeasures concept of activating a single shut off mechanism for all Internet traffic.

The concept behind having a kill switch is based on creating a single point of control (i.e. a switch) for a single authority to control or shut down the Internet in order to protect it or its users. Groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union and the Nominet Trust have criticized proposals for implementing the idea so far.

In computer networking, peering is a voluntary interconnection of administratively separate Internet networks for the purpose of exchanging traffic between the users of each network. The pure definition of peering is settlement-free, ""bill-and-keep,"" or ""sender keeps all,"" meaning that neither party pays the other in association with the exchange of traffic; instead, each derives and retains revenue from its own customers.

An agreement by two or more networks to peer is instantiated by a physical interconnection of the networks, an exchange of routing information through the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) routing protocol and, in some special cases, a formalized contractual document.

Occasionally the word ""peering"" is used to describe situations where there is some settlement involved.

***

**Internet exchange point**

An Internet exchange point (IX or IXP) is a physical infrastructure through which Internet service providers (ISPs) and Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) exchange Internet traffic between their networks (autonomous systems).

IXPs reduce the portion of an ISP's traffic which must be delivered via their upstream transit providers, thereby reducing the average per-bit delivery cost of their service. Furthermore, the increased number of paths available through the IXP improves routing efficiency and fault-tolerance. In addition to that, IXPs exhibit the characteristics of what economists call the network effect.

"> If the US Govt. tells all the US ISPs to stop network traffic then nothing gets in or out.

Why would the US Govt. commit economic suicide by turning off the internet? How likely do you find that to be? How many millions or billions would be lost if US companies were not online internationally for some extended period of time? 

It just seems cartoonish to imagine that there would be overt attacks on Bitcoin. Bitcoin will be attacked from the inside, not the outside. Bring too much attention to Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies and suffer as your ability to control the population is significantly reduced. 

> Bitcoin was an experiment cooked up by the NSA/CIA to see what would happen to a cryptocoin in the wild. (Proof? Who is Satoshi?)

That's not proof, that's complete inference. Not saying this is impossible, but you're going to need to bring a little bit more positive evidence other than your god of the gaps argument-esque argument. 

How do we falsify the claim that Satoshi was the NSA/CIA/GCHQ/Five Eyes/KGB/Mossad/Obsidian Order? Is it falsifiable at this point?

> Now, the Federal Reserve is thinking about getting into the game. Some day, the major banks will issue a new type of ""FedCoin"" and make all other cryptocurrencies an instrument of terrorism. You will get a 100% premined coin from the likes of JP Morgan and Citibank. Your current cryptos will instantly become illegal and/or worthless.

Do you realize that you're describing ideas from the second Season of Mr Robot, right? You're talking about Ecoin. How serious am I supposed to take you?

> Declare it to be illegal and used for Terrorism. They tell all US banks to stop doing business with exchanges that sell Bitcoin. The IRS goes after anyone using it in the USA. They tell the ISPs to traffic shape all public ports used for Bitcoin and block DNS of anything that looks like a Bitcoin Exchange.

This might heavily impact the ""legal"" use of Bitcoin in the United States, but all you did is start a massive streisand effect around cryptocurrencies, they'd symbolize resistance and I don't know how you wouldn't have worldwide dissent on your hands. 

Call me idealistic, but I see the future pendulum swinging towards a brighter future thanks to Bitcoin and other disintermediating currencies. There will likely be a battle somewhere in the middle, I have no idea how bad it get, how bad the currency wars will get.

"**Framing (social sciences)**

In the social sciences, framing comprises a set of concepts and theoretical perspectives on how individuals, groups, and societies, organize, perceive, and communicate about reality. Framing involves social construction of a social phenomenon – by mass media sources, political or social movements, political leaders, or other actors and organizations. Participation in a language community necessarily influences an individual's perception of the meanings attributed to words or phrases. Politically, the language communities of advertising, religion, and mass media are highly contested, whereas framing in less-sharply defended language communities might evolve imperceptibly and organically over cultural time frames, with fewer overt modes of disputation.

Of course there would be loans, companies whom own coin would give you a loan and operate the same way a bank does. Or you would pay a mortgage in the same way the only thing which is different is that it's coin and not your checking account. The banks are worried because it doesn't have to go through their ACH it can all be done on the blockchain easily -- this means no accounts for them, no fees, no investments... they're shit out of luck to have to compete with bitcoin.

"Wow that literally makes no sense lol. If you're paying in fiat, that is erroneous. If you paid $2000 you paid $2000. Fiat doesn't exponentially explode in value over the years

When you spend fiat. You can check your account ledger 10 years later and the price will relatively be the same. 

The *entire* point I'm making is that since bitcoin has yet to mature, expect to see more rise in valuation. Look at the historic price chart. 

When I bought some bitcoin to obtain a Trezor and sent that value to Trezor bc they forced you to pay in Bitcoin, that amount of bitcoin is now worth nearly $580. That is money that would have been in my account. This happened in a matter of a couple of months. 

Im not arguing about this lmao go ahead and send your bitcoins away haphazardly. You're silly, especially knowing the growth of the valuation on a year-to-year basis. 

Bitcoin has a limited supply of 5 million BTCs left with a 21 million cap. There are 7.5 billion people on the planet. Scarcity will continue to drive the price up in an exponential manner. 

I mean it's simple as hell. Back to my original hypothetical--if you would have chosen to not buy that TV and to hold on to the 153 bitcoins, you'd have $459,000 in Bitcoin. 

Oh wait, since I posted that, guess how much that valuation has risen since then?

153 bitcoin is now worth $579,870 

Do you not see the point I am making?? 

So in about 15 hours it has gained $120,000+ in valuation. 

gl hf sending your bitcoins away.

"**Shill**

A shill, also called a plant or a stooge, is a person who publicly helps or gives credibility to a person or organization without disclosing that they have a close relationship with the person or organization. Shills can carry out their operations in the areas of media, journalism, marketing, confidence games, or other business areas. A shill may also act to discredit opponents or critics of the person or organization in which they have a vested interest through character assassination or other means.

In most uses, shill refers to someone who purposely gives onlookers, participants or ""marks"" the impression of an enthusiastic customer independent of the seller, marketer or con artist, for whom they are secretly working.

"Its a  joke but you realize how it's an easy catch-22 to fall into because to point out someone else's obsession with black people it makes me look obsessed with black people? One thing that once I noticed it once, I couldnt stop noticing was race baiting in the media, especially the news and even movies, but also blogs and such. It's why race baiting is so insidious and infuriating. It is very good at raising tensions and turning people against eachother and the moment anyone brings it up, especially if they are white, it makes them look racist. So there is no point in hiding my feelings and the media, which much of it is algorithmically shoved in my face by youtube, and actually I am not obsessed with race AT ALL (i dont give a fuck about it), in fact just the opposite so when media brings it up all the time i find it incredibly annoying and insulting that the content producers think that I am a racist that constantly needs my bias challenged. Understand how someone may not care what race their friends, girlfriends, employers, employees, or co workers are yet feel offended when youtube videos and advertisements are constantly shoved into my screen which are intended to focus my attention on race? 

It's called race baiting and it's designed to keep the populace divided and mad at eachother so that they cannot challenge the establshment and also to convince minorities and gay people that they need a strong central government to protect them from evil states like South Carolina even though then they are vulnerable to a single fault and the swinging political pendulum and Trump banning trans people from the military proves. States rights, bitcoin, even uber, and more decentralized power  and authority in general hedge against, and allow all parties to have their cake and eat it to. People who are stupid, like racists or homophobes can have their retard corner, while more reasonable people are free to associate with eachother without the burden of assholes trying to wreck their society because they cant have their way. Racists would be less seductive if they were separated like the want to be but the media likes racists or calling people that *like* Trump may be a sleazeball casino owner, and think about it logically; a casino owner should want to let people make their own choices in life. Even if he is a Sleazeball he is not an authoritarian reptile or racist and wants to give more power to states and local communities.

The establishment is fearful of decentralized power and will do anything to defend their monopoly so they resort to petty strategies in order to weaken the general citizenry and prevent them from working together. Cohesive *organically organized* sectors all working in unison like cells and *organs* in an *organism* could easily overpower the establishment but they think if they can keep us in a blob of disarray then there's a chance that we wont stop the inevitable ""major event"" probably going to be carried out by ANTIFA or the ALT RIGHT which will serve to empower the totalitarian police state which so many of them crave and lust after. Racebaiting and nazi hysteria is the obvious weapon which they can use to accomplish this but it pisses me off the most when the globalist instigators get their slimy tentacles onto media i am very very passionate about like anime. 

Netflix  replaced ""L"" with a smooth black man in the, live action version of the anime, ""Death Note"" when he is supposed to be a half asian half white autistic nerd with *dark* circles under his eyes and ""L"" is possibly the most beloved anime character of all time and his race is a part of his characteristic traits and making him a smooth black man is like taking Kunta Kinte and making him big fat white woman. ""L"" is one of the few characters where his race matters although if there was a Black actor talented enough they may have been abel to pull him off but the Netflix depiction made absolutely no effort to do the character any justice and purposefully characterized him in an effort to radicalize fans of the original anime and to make them look like racists when they bring this up and netflix also characterized  the other characters by making the white main evil instead of chaotic neutral and the female lead into a hipstery Kirsten Stewart type instead of the prototypical bimbo she was in the anime although the cast the demon role perfectly which meant they are not stupid and probably made these casting choices intentionally. Because  the character ""L"" is a hero for lonely autistic nerd type this is why he was a good target to try and radicalize lonely generation Z kids, who already stray towards conservatism based on polls, because many of them watch anime. The following is a video that highlights how conservative gen z is:
>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avb8cwOgVQ8

Also I realized the new star trek trailers had a bunch of cool black and asian female characters be the good guys then an evil *cis white male*, which i think would be ok, but I really think their intent is to specifically radicalize people and producers of star trek already admitted that they had Trump voters in mind when they wrote the story and the villains are supposed to be them, which again is OK from an artistic point of view but the producer is guilty of race baiting in other instances and generalizing all Trump voters as racist or all white people as racist is just as *logically* bad as any racism towards black people, even if racism towards black people is *socially* less acceptable and there is hardly a point to arguing which problem is worse.  

Then the guy that produced that star trek also made ""the dark tower"" movie which replaced a character based on Clint Eastwood with a black guy which could be fine but thats a very iconic role and also scott eastwood is clints son and looking for work so its disappointing they didnt cast him, but the main point is that alone any of these would not be a big deal but together they show a trend of trying to take iconic ""white"" roles and replace them with black characters. Its very rare for race to matter for a character but they seem to be finding the only ones that do and forcing the audience to accept them unless they want to be racists which divides people. Its also insulting to the audience because that is the director telling you that you need to have your biases challenged. Furthermore there are specific people doing this more than once like Soros or the producer of start trek and director of the dark tower.

Netflix started race baiting when George Soros purchased a piece of the company. They came out with the show ""Dear White People"" which arguably had no positive message and only served to highlight the small micro agressions that white people may or not make but addressed white people as a collective which served to insult white people as well and Netflix ran commercials for this show on Youtube like crazy even though it seemed like something which wouldnt be popular at all, at least with white people, and youtube knows which users are white so forcing the ads in the face of white people seems strange or more precisely it seemed trolly, provocative and race baity. I dont need to be reminded of what some drunk frat boy does which isnt socially appropriate yet Netflix thought i should and I think that this is a direct influence of soros purchasing a major share of this company and soros is know for supporting anti police groups in ukraine and arguably was a major contributor to the revolution. 

>Anyway, just because some redditor doesn't like/trusts/prefers a certain news website you have to write ""personal attack alert"" 5 times in a row?

I know reddit is super duper serious *deep feelings only* but I thought some absurd sarcasm might be warranted. 4chan may not be your cup of tea but also some of the funniest things I have seen in my life come from there and it might seem asinine or ridiculous to you but others may find it funny because humor is subjective. If you read that comment again the absurd parts are supposed to be read in the voice of the redditor i was replying to and was a form of mocking. I do realize however that we are on reddit and this may not be the most effective tactic given the platform although I cant determine that without at least trying every different tactics in conveying my message.

Tbh I noticed that going the compassionate route actually works sometimes, and there was a female redditor calling me racist but when I got very deep, introspective, and compassionate she responded better and admitted she agreed with me.
Here is a podcast link to a part of a Rogan podcast with Whitney Cummings where they talk about how people only respond to arguments when you first acknowledge their opinion first:
>https://youtu.be/v_P55Bexc5s?t=8739

I know you may not give a shit but I type fast so as long as the words come to me i just keep going so excuse me if this comment is long but I thought in case there is a chance you care I will just keep typing.

Even though you may think Alex Jones is absurd himself, because you only see depictions of him from other sources such as John Oliver or Bill Maher, part of being fair and balanced in your political opinions looking at things from different perspectives and it's not fair to judge a media source without actually researching it yourself. Therefore I think its prudent for everyone who is critical of infowars or Alex Jones to watch or listen to a couple of episodes of his show in order to form a rational opion of him without outside influence. I dare you to watch the latest episode of his show from start to finish or at least half of it if you can mange:

"Like I said, unless you're Coldplay and writing songs for Mercedes-Benz commercials, you're likely not earning much money from selling music. Most musicians I know (I know a lot, and none of them are in Coldplay) earn money from playing gigs.

Mine are free to listen on SoundCloud; it's a choice which not many make. They'd rather have them on platforms which pay (YouTube, Spotify etc.).

Unless you're the Foo Fighters and your song has been on the radio for 10+ years, no, you're not making much money from selling/streaming your music. The bulk of your money if you're an average musician like me is made from playing concerts and selling merch. Records are considered more of a merch item nowadays since people buy them to support you and they just get tossed somewhere, because listening on streaming services is just way more convenient.

2. Bankers would need to do everything manually and everything would take a couple of days or weeks to avoid someone withdrawing money at 2 banks he doesn't really have.
3. Most if not all companies would collapse
4. Chaos because almost every human being in the world needs the internet as a form of communication
5. You really think the police and military would defend some people that are trying to destroy the country when almost 100% of the world is suffering? including the family members of the policeman and woman.

"Jesus christ then whats with the attack? I know this is reddit and everyone is super duper serious but I am trying to redpill some brainwashed liberals here. I know you might not think meme speak is very funny and I understand but I was doing it in a mocking way and you can see that the parts of my comment that were memey were supposed to be in the voice of the redditor I was replying to, therefore implying that their ideas were in fact the stupid ones like assuming anything produced by infowars is wrong, even if they promote some dome shit like ant vax arguments. Its the same as me screeching about an article on CNN that is factual or an interview. 

That is dogmatic and illogical and ad hominen. Idk though I will admit that reddit is a tough nut to crack and I dont know how to appeal to these liberal types so well and they may get offended at the slightest insult or joke unlike 4chan, but tbh I noticed that going the compassionate route actually works sometimes, and there was a female redditor calling me racist but when I got very deep, introspective, and compassionate she responded better and admitted she agreed with me.

1. President enables legal action via an executive order.

2. Government agencies contact main backbone ISPs and tell them to stop service.

3. Major backbone ISPs follow orders and discontinue service for 98% of Americans.

4. For additional control, they could also shut down traffic to root DNS servers. (Hopefully you've memorized the IP addresses of every site you like to visit?)

With no backbone traffic / peering and no DNS, the Internet is effectively useless.

"All traffic flows through [Internet Exchange Points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_exchange_point) (IXP). All of this runs on [hardware switches](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/DE-CIX_GERMANY_-_Switch_Rack_%286218137120%29.jpg). A system administrator (sysadmin) has access to the entire network of these hardware switches. By initiating a software program (or script) the sysadmin can shut down all of the hardware switches. They can also re-route ISP traffic wherever they want it to go. Instead of allowing traffic to pass through a network, they can set a flag telling the sender that the network is rejecting all traffic. Sort of a ""404"" message telling other routers & switches: ""I'm not available. Please try again later."" Many of the data centers also have Internet-connected power supplies. A sysadmin can connect to the power supply remotely and issue a shut down command to power down the system. In a worst-case-scenario they can physically press the power button and shut them down. If 5-10 of the MAJOR ISP networks in the USA shut down their IXP switches, all the traffic would effectively stop. You wouldn't be able to connect to anything.";1;1;False;notyourreality;dn13ile;Kim Dotcom: No Government can stop the rise of crypto now. Bankers begin to panic.

"**Internet exchange point**

An Internet exchange point (IX or IXP) is a physical infrastructure through which Internet service providers (ISPs) and Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) exchange Internet traffic between their networks (autonomous systems).

IXPs reduce the portion of an ISP's traffic which must be delivered via their upstream transit providers, thereby reducing the average per-bit delivery cost of their service. Furthermore, the increased number of paths available through the IXP improves routing efficiency and fault-tolerance. In addition to that, IXPs exhibit the characteristics of what economists call the network effect.

"**Internet kill switch**

An Internet kill switch is the cybercrime and countermeasures concept of activating a single shut off mechanism for all Internet traffic.

The concept behind having a kill switch is based on creating a single point of control (i.e. a switch) for a single authority to control or shut down the Internet in order to protect it or its users. Groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union and the Nominet Trust have criticized proposals for implementing the idea so far.

"What labels? Most small artists I know (which are the vast majority of working musicians) are independent and self-managed.

This is how they make some money today. I know this guy that paid $100,000 for a deal with Universal in Brazil. The guy's rich and could afford it. Universal will record and distribute his music for a large percentage of profits. There's been major touring artists in Brazil with record contracts that give ALL profits to labels for 2-3 years - they'll support you during that time and drop you afterwards unless you're immensely successful. This is widely known by the industry; some folks choose this path, others don't.

"I know that was the irony, but the difference between bitcoin and content is that bitcoin is intrinsically secure while securing content requires brutal authoritarianism. Are you really telling me people should get in trouble for pirating? IP is very abstract and I understand there is a debate to be had around what is ethical in terms of sharing but the thing that really drives me crazy about this is that there is a profit model that allows freely distributing information. Look at patreon or kickstarter or even advertising. Cryptocurrency is going ot make content creators so much fucking money in the future. Look at open source software and the profits people have made from that like Linus Torvalds who is a billionaire himself and he was able to give you his OS for free while Gates and Jobs made you pay out your ass and they would spy on you to. 

They are able to make money as content creators, arguably with less of a barrier to entry. Why resort to brutal authoritarian man made laws when there is already a solution for this. Songs and games may be 1s and 0s like bitcoin but they do not have the same cryptographic protection mechanisms and I argue that if someone should be able to intrinsically program content to be secure then there should be no rules against that but if someone is able to manipulate software or share then he should also be able to do that as well, and the best part is that the content creators still can make a buttload of money without violently attacking people simply for doing what they *could* digitally. And i know that there are some forms of violent digital actions but seriously its fucking human nature to share information and we are only going to trap ourselves in a police state if we go to any real measures to try and prevent that. 

People are willing to pay for content, but the abstraction of everyone owning their own copy of something is deprecated.

"**Subnetwork**

A subnetwork or subnet is a logical subdivision of an IP network. The practice of dividing a network into two or more networks is called subnetting.

Computers that belong to a subnet are addressed with a common, identical, most-significant bit-group in their IP address. This results in the logical division of an IP address into two fields, a network or routing prefix and the ""rest"" field or host identifier.

That would be a network address. A network mask is just a constant that you can apply (bitwise AND) to an IP to separate the subnet part and the host part of the address

"Yes, but I thought you said it was quickly appreciating :). I guess defining quickly would help here. And people, are holding it though.... That's what the market cap is, no?


As a retailer I would make a point to change my btc back to fiat ASAP on a rolling basis. This would solidify the profits of every sale and at the same time use the (albeit, limited at this point in time) fungibilty to make that btc spendable anywhere. 

And yes in certain markets the supposed ""risk"" would be overshadowed by the reward of more sales, by far in some cases. 

Say you offload to fiat every 12 hours automatically. But the price tanks in that time. You FREEZE the offload to fiat (yes I know, a blip in the revenue stream sucks, and could sink you in tougher times).

"I don't lock my house, and were I to be robbed most people would agree I made mistake in not securing it. But just because I don't lock my house doesn't mean that the robber had the right to steal from me, and it was still legally and morally wrong. There is no difference morally or legally in robbing a locked versus an unlocked house except for how much effort it took on behalf of the thief. 

I torrent TV shows and movies all the time, I currently have several files seeding on BitTorrent at the very moment, so trust me I'm not some old prude. But i still know that its not legal and and that the owner of the media I have pirated would be within their right to pursue action against me. It is a risk I have chose to take and I decided to pirate it because I couldn't afford it otherwise and I have justifications like ""The net loss of just *me* torrenting this instead of paying for it is a drop in the ocean to such-and-such producer"". I know that it still doesn't put me on the 'right' side though. I think ""brutal"" is wee bit dramatic

Crowd funding is a great way to launch a service or product but eventually for that product or service to remain viable they eventually have to use a standard business model where customers pay for things. most of the backer rewards could be considered pre-order sales anyways except you have no certainty of ever getting the product you backed. And new business models are already emerging for digital media streaming services have shook up how we consume music, TV series, and movies, and video games. Yes IP is abstract but so are laws, so is the value of fiat money, so is the value of Bitcoin. 

 If you think that we could legally redistribute movies to whom ever we want as much as we want there would be no incentive for producer's to put up hundreds of millions of dollars to make amazing movies or push the boundaries of modern video games. It wouldn't pay off for them, and if it ever reached a point were pirating was so prevalent then we wouldn't have those things in the first place.

Although there are likely too many ASIC's dedicated to mining for a supercomputer to overpower, its entirely feasible for a government to make an ASIC with a breakthrough technology like graphene to completely overpower the market.

"No offensive but you sound like you think that bitcoin is guaranteed to keep rising in price, which very well might happen, but any one crypto currency is just a speculative asset which should be played accordingly.

For many years people have been saying that bitcoin will soon be what you buy your grocerys with and whatnot but why hasnt it happened yet? There are some intrinsic hurtles that need to be  cleared before that can happen like specifically the speculative nature of bitcoin so it seems that although bitcoin may rise as a result of widespread adoption, it may still be deprecated by some other currency which hedges against speculation. 

Normies do not want to put their pay checks into something which they perceive as unstable. If regular currency fails they may run to bitcoin but the obvious holder of value is GOLD. And the perfect cryptocrurrency is one linked to it, or anything else which has tangible value like energy or ownership in a business. The problem is that that would be too good of a currency and governments may really clamp down and then bitcoin will stay relegated to black markets.

China coming out and telling a billion people that you can't trust a digital currency is going to shock the market. Its been happening since the beginning and nothing has changed but a normal price dip. Have you seen the growth? Ya dips are going to happen. Shit it's gone up 4k in 5 months.. I think a correction was expected and ofcourse China's the one to cause it. I'm glad it's this and not something serious because I've been saving up for the next chinagate scare. What's your aapl or goog done? Made you a few dollars in dividends? Lol you could pay 900 for Google and not make a dividend off it...

"You are kidding me, right?

A bunch of dumbed down fools, who think they are somehow masters of the universe because they are in a position to manipulate markets, which are so regulated and cushioned in their favour, that you'd have to be unconscious to NOT to be able manufacture 'money'; are somehow prepared for trading an actual free floating currency finding it's value in a completely uncushioned unprotected, unmanipulatable free market environment?

"who is this man you are referring to?

i think imo that’s way too much a black and white view in my opinion, technology is a tool sure, but people who work in banks and governments are not all honorable world loving people who like the idea of cutting out inefficiencies, many happen to benefit immensely from the status quo. Why do you think we have been using petrol for so long?

On the other hand, not all crypto supporters are anarchists which seek to bypass governments, etc, but many people are using blockchain tech to commit fraud. It’s just not such a black and white issue. Many regulations stifle innovation, but protect people at the same time.

Taking such a one sided view is exactly how we ended up in such a divided society both economically and perspective wise.

To challenge your view, how does Bitcoins mishaps measure with the likes of the mortgage backed security fraud, interbank fixing, Bernie Madoff and hundreds of cases where lives have been ruined?

"Meh just that the liberal media should like this guy, but the problem is that he is supportive of self empowerment and individualism. Also I have seen reddit posters attacking the fact that his wife is younger than him which is ironic because she comes from a very poor family and he undoubtedly improved her standard of living. 

My comment was a big sarcastic and a jab at the liberal media and their brainwashed minions for their hypocrisy. Honestly the fact that his wife is black shouldnt matter at all and I am kinda a douchebag for even noticing it or caring about it in the first place but I see all this shit in the media trying to be supportive of black women and here John Mcafee is marrying one and making her life a lot better, so why isnt the liberal media enamored with him? Like I said, they have purposefully sought to corrupt the public's picture of him and painted him as a murderer and drug addict. Mcafee surely hasnt killed anyone unless it was in self defense when he was escaping beliz but the ""neighbor's dog"" story is false and you should watch interviews with macafee to see that it was an attempt by the media to corrupt his image. The media also released a story about him dying and then 24 hours later he had a hit attempt against his life so someone within the media is working with criminal or political organizations that dont like him. Also if he is a drug addict then why should we fucking care because he seems very functional and composed.

I honestly think that other than just the Belizean government there are others against him in the establishment and media. He exposed Belize selling passports to members of terror groups and we know that there are elements of the establishment aligned with terror groups like John Mccain who is pictured meeting with terrorists. Many terror groups were trained by the CIA to fight the soviets so its not a stretch to believe they may still have connections and Mcafee not only exposed part of the passport ring but also is a national symbol for individual freedoms and privacy and is working to subvert the main network which is monitored with a secure anonymous private dual linked  sub net quantum mask and he also has inside information because of his past work with information security. All in all I think its safe to say that Mcafee is being targeted by the Belizean government but also possible international crime members and there is a small chance that some US group may not like him as well.

"Do not mother fucking judge a man before listening to his own words. **Mcafee making a statement about his innocence:**

https://youtu.be/lAXbUXd_CFE?t=1494

His dog was killed after he exposed the Belizean government for producing ricin and selling passports to terrorists and there was an attempt on his life before the dogs were killed and Faull was killed. Mcafee is a reasonable person, a programmer by nature, and he had no logical reason for killing someone, and risking his luxurious life, and the Belizean government was proven to be **wildly** corrupt and they are the likely killers of Faull. Mcafee even says that if someone did something bad to him he would rather keep them alive so he could get revenge in other ways. 

And lets be honest, killing a dog is almost like killing a member of a family. I am not saying it's right but it's not trivial either, but either way You need to listen to Mcafee's own words because they are damn convincing and the Belizean government harassed him on **numerous** occasions and they have **tried to kill him at least three times.**

Here is an article about the latest attempt on his life:

>http://www.zdnet.com/article/john-mcafee-reportedly-lands-in-hospital-after-attack/

Basically someone tried to poison him or make him ill recently and in the past there have been even media reports released about his death right before someone attacked him. Mcafee is no murder, rather, he is a victim of relentless pursuit by wealthy thugs which will stop at nothing to harm him and slander him in the media which you have sadly been persuaded by.

The Belezean gangster government has tried to kill him 3 times and Mcafee is a victim of a relentless pursuit on his life and they will do anything to slander him including kill his dogs in an attempt to connect him to a murder. 

And bottom line if someone kills your pet that is *almost* grounds for physical violence. Its not, and anyone who does that is a piece of shit in their own right but at the same time there are things that are forgivable and the world isnt black or white and the teachings of Jesus Christ lament about the importance of forgiveness. Even a rapist serial killer like Hillary Clinton could repent and do the world some good and John Mcafee chooses to use his enormous resources to help fight for freedom and he is taking on projects which will help us hold on to our privacy.

OMFG, linking a motherfucking GIZMONDO article.  You know who these people are allied with? They're almost as bad as buzzfeed or gawker and produce clickbait specifically for facebook. You are acting as if cooperating with them is considered honorable and they are not fair game to deceive, and in Mcafee's case, spy on. You just linked a fucking article that makes Mcafee look bad ass as fuck. He literally gave the reporters a trojan horse like a fuckin genius spartan and then proceeded to btfo all them. Mcafee even admitted his plan to Moxie and did not lie to the hacker community! Do you understand that the neo liberal, globalist, marxist, click bait media may hate and disrespect Mcafee but that is *specifically* why ""hackers"" and libertarians  **love** him and also because he is a credible ""hacker"" who has revealed actual exploits and vulnerabilities. 

Mcafee is a regular attendent of defcon where he receives the love and adulation of hundreds of IT security professionals. I think that is much more respectable that a bunch of blood thirsty sjw millennial hounds that try to find anything they can blame some for and outrage their audience with! And before you go looking at hacker news or wherever and confirm your bias by reading the negative comments just remember that brainwashed libtards have managed to get their tentacles in even the most libertarian authentic programming circles and sites (like google which used to be libertarian), but although Mcafee may not have produced much code in recent years he employs dozens of very talented programmers and IT professionals and so he supports freedom and technology through those endeavors. The media slander combined with the unlicensed use of his software as a form of malware means that many less intelligent and unaware programmers and IT professionals have ignorant opinions of the man but many many more **love** the guy!

Do realize I was being sarcastic and it sort of worked judging by the responses?
The exact point is **no one cares about race except libtards** because they are constantly race baiting in media!!!

The establishment is fearful of decentralized power and will do anything to defend their monopoly so they resort to petty strategies in order to weaken the general citizenry and prevent them from working together. Cohesive organically organized sectors all working in unison like cells and organs in an organism could easily overpower the establishment but they think if they can keep us in a blob of disarray then there's a chance that we wont stop the inevitable ""major event"" probably going to be carried out by ANTIFA which will serve to empower the totalitarian police state which so many of them crave and lust after. Racebaiting and nazi hysteria is the obvious weapon which they can use to accomplish this but it pisses me off the most when the globalist instigators get their slimy tentacles onto media i am very very passionate about like anime.
Netflix replaced ""L"" with a smooth black man in the, live action version of the anime, ""Death Note"" when he is supposed to be a half asian half white autistic nerd with dark circles under his eyes and ""L"" is possibly the most beloved anime character of all time and his race is a part of his characteristic traits and making him a smooth black man is like taking Kunta Kinte and making him big fat white woman. ""L"" is one of the few characters where his race matters although if there was a Black actor talented enough they may have been abel to pull him off but the Netflix depiction made absolutely no effort to do the character any justice and purposefully characterized him in an effort to radicalize fans of the original anime and to make them look like racists when they bring this up and netflix also characterized the other characters by making the white main evil instead of chaotic neutral and the female lead into a hipstery Kirsten Stewart type instead of the prototypical bimbo she was in the anime although the cast the demon role perfectly which meant they are not stupid and probably made these casting choices intentionally. Because the character ""L"" is a hero for lonely autistic nerd type this is why he was a good target to try and radicalize lonely generation Z kids, who already stray towards conservatism based on polls, because many of them watch anime. The following is 

A video that highlights how conservative gen z is:
>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avb8cwOgVQ8

Also the new star trek trailers had a bunch of cool black and asian female characters be the good guys then an evil cis white male, which i think would be ok, but I really think their intent is to specifically radicalize people and producers of star trek already admitted that they had Trump voters in mind when they wrote the story and the villains are supposed to be them, which again is OK from an artistic point of view but the producer is guilty of race baiting in other instances and generalizing all Trump voters as racist.

Then the guy that produced that star trek also made ""the dark tower"" movie which replaced a character based on Clint Eastwood with a black guy which could be fine but thats a very iconic role and also scott eastwood is clints son and looking for work so its disappointing they didnt cast him, but the main point is that alone any of these would not be a big deal but together they show a trend of trying to take iconic ""white"" roles and replace them with black characters. Its very rare for race to matter for a character but they seem to be finding the only ones that do and forcing the audience to accept them unless they want to be racists which divides people. Its also insulting to the audience because that is the director telling you that you need to have your biases challenged. Furthermore there are specific people doing this more than once like Soros or the producer of start trek and director of the dark tower.

Netflix started race baiting when George Soros purchased a piece of the company. They came out with the show ""Dear White People"" which arguably had no positive message and only served to highlight the small micro agressions that white people may or not make but addressed white people as a collective which served to insult white people as well and Netflix ran commercials for this show on Youtube like crazy even though it seemed like something which wouldnt be popular at all, at least with white people, and youtube knows which users are white so forcing the ads in the face of white people seems strange or more precisely it seemed trolly, provocative and race baity. I dont need to be reminded of what some drunk frat boy does which isnt socially appropriate yet Netflix thought i should.

Progressive in liberal terms, would literally be taking all the rich people's money and giving it to the poor, completely disincentivizing innovation; then making sure to regulate bitcoin, and banning gold outright; then teaching kids that they are not people until they are old enough to identify as a species; then bringing in radicalists (not just Islam but all kinds from around the world) to commit as many acts of violence as possible in an effort to empower the police state; then telling white people they are not allowed to breed, and must only date other races then removing all firearms while letting criminals have them in order to make people as reliant on the police state as possible; then killing all men and producing a machine which can create artificial semen. 

My whole point about his wife being black was that **only libtards care about race anymore**... and John should get a pass into their virtue signalling club because he improved the standard of living for multiple black women but the liberal media hates him because he fucked those ladies instead of being submissive to them and Mcafee stands for empowering individuals while the liberal media club wants to weaken people an make them dependent on a central authority.

"“Capitalism, because of the rarely acknowledged drag of market inertia and resultant excessive capital to change, is a conservative system, and conservative systems generate status quos.

You could have just said that and I would have agreed with you, the moment I wrote that petrol line - I knew it was the weak link. 

What I was trying to say, was petrol is an example of how things don’t change easily via a bunch of reasons, including the nature of capitalism itself which is driven by self-interest. Another prime example would be NFC payments. In newer countries these are widespread, but in older countries they are only just coming about.

My point is it’s “complicated”. I would say that software does seem to disrupt differently, as petrol is a capital intensive industry, but I won’t go into the nuances of that as I would end up writing something as long as what you wrote.

The zealotry is bad on both sides, fanatics exists on both sides. Calling Bitcoin a fraud, only for criminals and worthless is going way too far, as well as the ultra libertarian people that seems to forget that predators and stupid people are common.

The way I see it is - ideally the regulationist’s dystopia can be REFORMED not REPLACED. The Bitcoin fanatics play an important dynamic to not let the commnunity make the status quo think they can keep the status quo, but ultimately their goals are unrealistic and unprobable. 

I guess the question is will the regulators do the right thing and protect the community or will they just guard their own self interests and I don’t think there is a really clear answer. If you look at the bit license thing in NY , there were valid concerns, and also there are valid concerns with ICOs that nobody here wants to talk about (I got soft banned for bringing it up), but did it stifle Bitcoin’s development - sure. I don’t think the guy who came up with the bit license had “evil intentions” per say.

What i’m trying to say is I don’t like this thing we constantly have online these days, where people simplify the problem and just villify the other side, though I also don’t like when people assume that the ones in power are powerless and only subject to circumstances and generally want the best for everyone else. That is simply not true. The true reality is for every ecosystem you have thousands and thousands of people and they all act in different ways. It’s more like a tapestry. It’s like this in every industry.

The banking industry - I know people who are very good friends of mine, but I also know people that are genuinely the horrible people the anti-banking people talk about. If we evaluate on a macro level the entire banking industry is problematic, if it wasn’t then Bitcoin wouldn’t even exist.

Going back to the petrol industry, or automobiles on the macro level the industry is not problematic in the same way banking currently is. By and large like you described everything in the auto/petrol industry is driven by economics and existing eco systems. The banking industry is quasi-government which makes it very different to other industries in that it has extreme legal power over citizens. The centralisation of banking powers have essentially created a monster. Just the fact that citizens money can be mixed with investment banks is just one of the many examples, most of which you are familiar with.

Do hundreds of banking systems exists for real reasons and have use, and have inertia yeah sure, and those people working on these systems are not inherently evil or bad, or part of some cartel. Most of them are not anyways, but overall the banking industry is a over rewarded bubble that is detached from real market forces. 

And the reason why I am here - is I believe we may have a chance to break this bubble which is 50% of our economy and let the productivity of all these brilliant people working in finance to work in other things instead.

Edit: And yes I believe that would require reaching the aisle and talking with the regulators and big players, and like you said - these people aren’t stupid, they want a piece of the action too, they already understand the potential of this technology, as long as the Bitcoin community don’t give up their core values then ultimately we could end up with something much better. There are win win solutions.

And anyhow I don’t believe you can simply destroy these people anyways, a lot of them have a lot of money and influence, what is important is to know that there are good people over the fence, but there are also wolves, and the same goes for people on the Bitcoin side too.";3;2;False;slowsynapse;dn0zmhv;Kim Dotcom: No Government can stop the rise of crypto now.

>Why do you think we have been using petrol for so long?

Before I begin, we have not being using petrol for so long, it's been for about 200 of the 25,000 years of our known Neolithic existence. That's only the last .008% of our organized-resource-harvesting written history. If written history were a clock, we'd only have started using petroleum the last 28 seconds before midnight. 

To the point though, it's not because of patents being suppressed and ingenious inventors dying mysteriously. Not because of properties of physics the government or the illuminati or the global oil cabal or whomever are actively denying. 

The answer is the utility of the petroleum molecule, market inertia, and hucksterism. There are plenty of working prototype hydrogen cars, supercapacitor-based electric cars compressed air cars, water cars, and many more, and nobody is denying that these things are possible or incredible, and their inventors are eagerly securing funding - but their difficulty in fostering demand is proportional to the relative cheapness and ubiquitousness that the inertia of older primary and secondary markets for ICEs and accessories creates. The aftermarket for petrol engines in the USA and around the world is huge - ICE powered machines don't just get taken back after a handful of years, a new year's car sales trails in the market for decades. This makes the knowledge on how to design an ICE cheaper and easier to access since more engineers are trained in this and the nuances of the behavior of heat transfer and the combustion process are more well understood. The knowledge of how to make the toolings to make ICE parts and how to make the ICE parts themselves makes things cheaper, though 3d-printed rapid prototyping is quickly eliminating the inertia in that field. The secondary industry is gigantic, and all those players are specialized in ICE and all those employees are trained in ICE. The whole infrastructure of petrol acquisition, processing, and distribution, is massive and plugged into every capillary of the moving world, and that creates gargantuan amounts of drag, because that well-established logistical infrastructure makes it cheaper simply due to any other motor technology still not having a convenient, ubiquitous way to keep it going, with the exception of electric cars in those parts of the world where people have dependable two-phase power and money enough for an electric car. 

So all this inertia not only creates a cheaper primary and secondary market by way of innovation always being cheaper and easier than invention, it also creates more convenience in its ubiquity, it creates a sense of familiarity, and it creates an emotional gap that the inventor of any new technology must always hurdle. Not only in consumers, but also in investors.

There is much more demand for non-petrol cars in parts of the world with little petrol infrastructure or market inertia, especially where such things also don't have to conform to consumer safety standards. India is a prime example - jugaad has made a good run of getting a large number of cars to run on lots of things, and there are the beginnings of hydrogen, LNG, and compressed air shops to fill these myriad cars with. 

All of this goes for petrochemistry as well. Petroleum just does so many things and becomes so many things, and does it well! Yes, the externality of being completely dependent on the oil extractors and a fossil fuel are greater at this point than its utility, but its utility combined with the fact that we know a lot more about not only how to make things from petroleum, but how to make and distribute them profitably and how to figure out how to make new things from it more cheaply.

Which brings me to the second point - for every working prototype of a new means of transport, there are a hundred claiming perpetual motion, dimensional energy harvesting, new forms of matter, and denying access to their creation to all those who could see how it works, or at least to check for any classical magicians tricks like hidden batteries or lies about torque and gear ratios, or the host of youtube videos of guys with HHO engines having been found out to have had purified clear gasoline or other fuel in that bottle of ""water"", or those that, while rightly claiming that they're using water to run the car on, are found to be using more energy to crack the water than it would take to just turn the crankshaft directly. 

I will fully admit that I do not believe that we understand everything about physics, and that out there someone probably has discovered something revolutionary, and that there has been pushback by entrenched energy interests on the widespread adoption of new technology. However, their power is not omnipotent, being demonstrated by losing the fight against wind and solar power adoption in only a handful of years extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, extraordinary evidence requires comprehensive experimentation and an adherence to the negation principle, and a youtube video of a project that has not been replicated in a lab or on separate occasions or even in public does not count, and the conspiracy cult that has grown up around them does not make up for it. Those scant few technically feasible ways of providing energy for machines left are often too dangerous to put in something that sees such rugged use as consumer appliances and machines. 

None of which bodes well for the confidence of investors, manufacturers, or the general public. Few want to invest in new technolgies, especially ones that by their nature require immense physical assets and manufacturing goods and the crapshoot the ubiquity of false claims and permissiveness of believers creates on actually putting cash in something that works and scales will deter even the most adamant of bourgeoisie revolutionaries. Capitalism, because of the rarely acknowledged drag of market inertia and resultant excessive capital to change, is a conservative system, and conservative systems generate status quos.  



>how does Bitcoins mishaps measure with the likes of the mortgage backed security fraud, interbank fixing, Bernie Madoff and hundreds of cases where lives have been ruined?

Given that the Bitcoin Conference is hosted by a guy that can never set foot in the state of Ohio without never leaving a federal prison again, and probably should just never come back to the USA, because of his long list of convictions of foreclosure fraud, defrauding the elderly and non-English speakers, and investors, i'd say there's no need to compare because most of the people defrauding the regular market are having a field day with the community's eager acceptance of blind evangelism as objective logic, because of course libertarians have the sole claim to true, pure logic and clear objective understanding, and in this blindness being ripped off by the same fucking people using the same social engineering methods they defrauded homeowners with. As for interbank fixing, those interbank indicators are like GDP: the inventor of GDP stated clearly and repeatedly that his calculation was for nothing more than calculating what the output capacity for arms production for WWII could be and what was going on. He repeatedly and loudly said, often shouting at people at the League of Nations and the UN, that it was not an indicator of any useful peacetime national statistic. However, humans, especially men at the apex with a need for a new dick to swing in everyone's faces, eagerly took this one single number as a way to rank every nation one dimensionally in order to say ""my number is the bigger number!"" Similarly, LIBOR and the like were designed as rough estimators, sort of an international technical indicator, always meant to be a suggestor of specific things. But international banks just said ""it's a number, it changes, it seems to correspond to stuff, so we'll use it for tacking things to"". I'm as unconcerned with interbank fixing as I am with GDP because the numbers the banks are fixing never meant all that much in the first place, and both are just products of politicians looking for something to take home to the base and rushing processes they didn't understand through in time for the next town hall or election. 

>What about the people panicking because they are worried that Bitcoin will undermined? 

They have every right to panic, because Bitcoin is frequently undermined, both by community zealotry, and by the constant predation and fraud enabled by the community's insistence on such things being the price of liberty and a better option than living under the regulationist's dystopia. 

TL;DR the man is Tha Powah, I just said that black and white reasoning is what is at fault here and that monolithicism is in general unhealthy, we still use petrol because you underestimate the cost of proving a new technology and driving out an existing convenient and ubiquitous one, and the measures of fraud in both communities even out because it's the same people generally and the community celebrates them, and regular people wanting to use and invest in bitcoin have every right to be panicked that Bitcoin will be undermined and their funds stolen because a sizeable amount of the community does that every damn day.

"Nothing ""resolves itself"", people resolve things, and through their perception of how to solve it. Multisig and timelocks are indeed fantastic fixes, but nothing guarantees that a good resolution would just have inherently been found or that the people implementing it would implement it in a manner that solves it. 

And on top of that, while I do agree with you that exchanges are learning the basics of business, customer security, customer service, and investor confidence the hard way, and that sooner rather than later they'll be pretty safe places to park money, they are only one component of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, and the security of exchanges still doesn't invalidate my primary premise that the only people panicking are those who thought that being on the internet and in the blockchain meant they could create a business and handle and change money at a distance from reality and were totally unprepared to be told that their business is a business, and it is in and a part of the world, and that this world has rules; those whose view is black and white, monolithic, and paranoid of all external power; and predators who are here because the wild west attitude creates an air of permissiveness and victim blaming which is fertile ground for theft, fraud, and abuse.
