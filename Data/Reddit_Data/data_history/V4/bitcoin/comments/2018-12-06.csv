">Fees for converting your currency into bitcoins

This is an annoying one, but it's small and once per month for me, so I deal with it for the moment.  Once my employer pays me directly in bitcoin, I get to avoid this one as well.

>network transaction fees

Tiny and worth it.

>merchant fees for converting coins back into currency

No merchant has ever charged me an extra fee for using bitcoin (the BitPay payment processor does, but I avoid them because they do a lot of pretty shady stuff that I strongly disagree with).

I also take exception to the term ""back in to currency"".  It already is a currency.  I think you mean, ""in to a different currency""

>And higher prices because coin volatility is high.

I don't understand what the volatility of the exchange rate has to do with the prices.  A merchant's price in bitcoin may change as the exchange rate fluctuates if they're pricing it in the fiat currency (which well over 99% of them do), but volatility works in both directions, so it evens itself out either way (and looking at it from that perspective, coins that I exchanged for under $10 worth of fiat and spent on things worth thousands of dollars have got to put me pretty far ""in the green""... I just don't usually look at it from that perspective)

>You need to dispute transactions when the provider doesn't deliver or refuses to refund for faulty goods or services.

I've literally never had this issue in my life.  And if I did, then how would it be any different than if I'd paid with cash?   And if I paid with a credit card and did a ""charge back"", the vendor could of course dispute that.  At some point, there'd need to be a legal process involved and this is true regardless of the payment method isn't it?

>Not to mention that you have to be very computer literate to be able to keep your coins secure from theft.

Currently, it's not for everyone.  I never said it was.  I'd dispute that you need to be computer literate, but you do need to be bitcoin literate (it's not the same thing at all).

Funny thing. About a year ago, I had to get braces, but it cost too much: €3500. So I didn't. Over the course of the year, I invested almost that amount in crypto which now is about $500. ;38;3;False;yotsuya94;eb8d0yl;Priorities;a3n8qb;https://i.redd.it/fg3727v3an221.jpg
