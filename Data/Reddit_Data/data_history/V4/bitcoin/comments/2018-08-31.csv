yeah it's a good gamble. this guy is an idiot who runs on a flawed ideology. you can tell by how self-righteous and sure of himself he is. it's sand and terrible :( tbh.;0;0;False;vtesterlwg;e54ixbn;Cheers!;9au41d;https://i.redd.it/hmzbd5az5qi11.jpg

Well without those people, the hash rate would have been like near 0 to start and the real bitcoin would have died when the corporate bitcoin forked.;1;0;False;cryptomon;e54mt9w;Differences;9b7ytt;https://i.redd.it/7o3pfifob0j11.jpg
"Please, with all of your negatively rated comments (I'm not a contributor to that by the way), reply as to how it is NOT a protocol.  You can't.  Maybe you're caught up in losing a bunch and want BTC to be at $20K (idiotically) again.  Who knows.  If you want a copycat, get on Charlie's ass.  Reading isn't very hard   [and this is just an example of how it came about](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litecoin).

&#x200B;

It should be Bitcoin Lite but Charlie duped everyone with the name Litecoin and the coming ""Lightning Network"" because it makes it sound good.  And, so far, that's all it's done...sound like a good idea (to some, at least).  Explain how [this](https://lnmainnet.gaben.win/) is not centralized.  Maybe I can't see straight, but that red, right in the middle, has some massive pull and will only continue to gain.

Roger's not the only person who pushes chains to try to keep BTC devs from making rash decisions that could inherently have huge negative effects in the future.  That's why there are other coins.  Bitcoin BTC will never be the only coin.

&#x200B;

And constantly saying Bcash just shows that you hate Roger, not that you care for either coin, because it IS a Bitcoin.  Peek over the fence sometime and you'll see the grass is growing from the same ground.  It's about what a coin can do, not who's for it.  P2P Cash will win the battle in all of this, whichever coin that ends up being in 20 years.  As of now, Bitcoin's not even 10 years old so you may want to put a few eggs in other baskets.  Would hate to see anyone lose them all should something happen without diversification.";1;1;False;Cow_Bell;e56j6ep;Differences;9b7ytt;https://i.redd.it/7o3pfifob0j11.jpg

Really? Bcash is a protocol . Hmm...   I guess it just gets arbitrarily screwed with by the masters without consensus whenever they please.;1;2;False;flowbrother;e55d19x;Differences;9b7ytt;https://i.redd.it/7o3pfifob0j11.jpg
"AND the masters are being sneaky.

There is something going on that is being hidden.

That supposed Bangkok meeting was not a meeting at all.

I’d like to know where the meeting was. Reps went to the W and no one knew anything about it.

Bangkok miners were in the dark, not invited and didn’t know anything about it either.

Shit like this is WAY more important than a playing “stress test” from one website. Just another distraction for users.

I made a post asking about the meeting and roger answered saying it is (meaning was??) elsewhere???!!? How fucking opaque could this be?

In other words he spoke in the future tense about a meeting that supposedly happened yesterday.

I think there is some hoodwinking going on.
