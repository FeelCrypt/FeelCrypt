"[this comment is irrelevant to the puzzle]

This is just an ""out there"" random thought but ...

Isn't it odd that the Coin_Artist puzzle revealed some weird BTC siphon, and now *this* puzzle happens just as smaller minning network/hashed cryptocurrencies are getting hit with 51% attacks and the like (XVG wasn't exactly a classic 51% attack per se, as it merely manipulated the coding within the deployed mining algorithm) -- all while this puzzle's creator/host has dropped the clues that implies an attacker's chain? Are these two events related y'all think, or just mere coincidence?

This idea of some Conspiracy Theory hit me when I was watching Ivan on Tech's, ""Did Roger Convince Ivan!? 51% Attack Cost - Programmer explains"" YouTube video (source: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=bQwdtAMbvec# ).

"Regarding someone finding a pentagram (I tried to find their subReddit post here in the thread to know their handle but either they deleted it or I'm missing it lacking an eye for scrolling detail) aka star within the circle, I been too busy to check as I was thinking this may exist anyway but been out this holiday and my phone screen does this puzzle no justice, but it was on my to-do list given this info I came across upon this past week researching every clue down any rabbit hole I could find:

There may indeed be a star in the circle, and it may or may not be towards the 1 BTC treasure. OP said there were consolation prizes. Thus, in a way, there maybe Easter Eggs hidden within this puzzle too I presume from such clues OP submitted.

One of the clues quoted Pixar's Toy Story Buzz Lightyear, Buzz Lightyear used an Easter Egg to propel him to fly. That Easter Egg in Toy Story and in other Pixar films was a ball with a big red star and the ball also had a ring and I think it was a yellow ring band over a predominantly blue ball if I remember correctly -- thus in 2D this would render as a circle with a star in the middle. I have a hunch this is one of the smaller consolation prizes of which have been hidden within this puzzle. Though, again, I have not sat down and searched for this star so I cannot confirm that a star can be found but someone on this Reddit thread beat me to posting this ""star"" idea and so are claiming there is indeed a star within the puzzle's circle. I am however providing the reasoning as to why that matches up to the clues given, if such a star does exist there in this puzzle.

"This is the assumption I'm working off of: ""transaction costs almost lost users"" is part of a longer message, where a pair of seed words are somehow related to each word in the message. So if there are 12 words in the message, that makes 24 seed words (12 pairs). 

I have represented each clue pair and message word as ascii/hex/binary, where the value is the sum of digits in the encoded representation. For example:

binary_sum('code') = 17 and binary_sum('easily') = 25, so the total sum is 17+25 = 42. I have also tried it as '1725', as well as 15 (1+7+2+5).

The thought is that a pair's sum will match the sum of a word in the message, but I am finding no patterns whatsoever with this process.

Have also tried drawing all types of lines connecting the pair representations, but still nothing.

Maybe the pair representations are polar coordinates? But what would a (17, 25) coordinate even mean in this instance when there's no indication of what unit of measure to use in this image?

I have also decoded the hex strings of the transaction block containing the 00212121 transaction... no hidden messages.

Is anyone actually any closer than they were a week ago? Just feels like a wild goose chase at this point. I am spending too much time on this and will have to retire unless we get another clue that brings any amount of clarity.";3;3;False;yobogoya_;dzo3ph5;1 BTC is hidden in this puzzle.

"I'm not sure where the points within the circle are but I'm convinced there are corresponding points within the line of that circle and it could be as simple as looking at the design to match them up, use the numbers like you did, or something more difficult like using pointers returned from the mining algorithm or HashCash function from the pairing of z's and q's.

Anyway, both the infinity symbol and the unknown symbol (upside down ""y"") are not only within but are beside the line that curves to form the circle and a circle has infinite points on it so I think this has to do with infinity but within infinity there will be these specific points and those points are info/data to get through the steps for unlocking the wallet's private key.

If OP were inspired by Coin_Artist in also how they executed their design of this puzzle, then I would run the RBG color values, and/or look for simple outliner clues along any edge (mainly the circle as I really think that's the infinity OP implies in their Reddit clues) -- as that was how the 3 year long puzzle was solved (the flames using RBG values and the ribbon lengths). If so it is technically in plain sight but not really imho as one would have to interpret what is in plain sight in front of us all as it isn't actually straightforward -- but maybe it is ::: shrugs :::";2;1;False;AmirisJBrown;dznnjbr;1 BTC is hidden in this puzzle.

"yes, 12 18 and 24 are more probable if we are search for a seed due to the 'pair' clue, if we are searching for a private key then all the other number and some of the seed word would be required (all seed word can be translated to a number) We do not know for sure yet what we need to find but ""hidden in plain sight"" clue may be an indication that it is only a seed.";3;0;False;P00r;dzn06ej;1 BTC is hidden in this puzzle.
