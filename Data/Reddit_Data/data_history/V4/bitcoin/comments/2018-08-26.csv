Well yeah, duh.  Of course Google made an agreement with those institutions.  That's how enterprise hardware purchasing works.

Also, with the possible exception of the Pixel line, Google is very much *not* a hardware company.  They develop ChromeOS (and Android, and Fuchsia), which actual hardware companies like Samsung and HP and Dell and Acer and Lenovo install on the Chromebooks they manufacture and sell.

"> There is nothing that Chromebook does that an iPad doesn't do better.

Aside from having an actual keyboard, being significantly cheaper (both to purchase and repair), and - again - having significantly better enterprise management features (at least last I checked), then sure.

> most of the rest of the world happily uses an iPad

I highly doubt that.  I don't have direct experience here (I've never dealt with ed-tech outside of the US), but IIRC Android tablets are more affordable at scale and therefore more popular among schools buying devices.

In terms of absolute numbers, [iPads haven't been in the worldwide majority since 2012](https://www.statista.com/statistics/276635/market-share-held-by-tablet-vendors/).  Most of the rest of the world uses Android, not iOS, for their tablet needs.  And that doesn't factor in non-tablet devices (like Chromebooks and other cheap laptops) cutting into that percentage even further.

> google [...] mostly sells them to universities and schools that don't know any better

I know from personal experience and observation that quite a few of those schools actually tried iPads first, realized they're too expensive to be able to hand to students (and too difficult to adequately lock down or otherwise customize), and switched to Chromebooks instead.

> There is absolutely no need for two OSes in such similar use cases.

I agree 100%.  I suspect Fuchsia is supposed to be a unified OS to that effect; that's not an uncommon observation/prediction, by any means.  Android could potentially be reworked to fit this bill, too, but past attempts haven't been particularly successful (see also: Motorola Atrix).

> If Google wants to transition to heavy duty content creation, fine.

I don't think they do.  Even in the education sector, where Chromebooks are dominant, most students aren't doing heavy-duty content creation (I certainly wouldn't count word processing or making slideshows in that category).  Even when they are, it's usually for a specific class, and even an iPad is more often than not insufficient (since the sorts of software being taught are things like Photoshop or AutoCAD that - while they do technically have iOS or Android versions - are usually used on full-blown workstations in the real world, and therefore preferably taught on similar workstations, whether running macOS or Windows).

Google's Pixelbook does seem to be billed to somewhat heavier-duty content creation, what with its pen and souped-up specs, but Chromebooks - like most netbooks - are designed for content consumption, and do a reasonably good job of it.";1;1;False;northrupthebandgeek;e4vgwye;Will this ever happen?;9a6qnw;https://i.redd.it/k40rw8ncq8i11.jpg

"Definitely not any time soon! But in another 100 years its not impossible, as what happened to the pound.

Individual countries will always use their own currency internally (pound, euros etc) to maintain a level of control, gather tax etc where they have a currency worth using. USD is the base currency for most global trade and currently much of the developing world use USD as a base even internally. But Chinese influence is growing in poorer countries, which are also the ones with faster population growth. The influence has an effect on internal decision making, and when reserve banks decide to reduce their holdings of USD reserves in favour of something else (let's hope its Crypto, but it could be Rembini or something else), the dollar could devalue rapidly. I understand its something the US is quite scared of, so they lobby to keep the dollar as the global reserve currency (hopefully someone with better knowledge can give more detail?)

Its fun speculating, but also we can be thankful that we're alive in a period of relative calm and prosperity.

">Have you seen our infant mortality rate? Our healthcare system ain't that great.

I'm not defending the US system. I just assign different causes for it being shitty than you. Instead of blaming the free market for making it shitty I would look at for example the supply constraints created by the AMA and the laws that prevent mutual aid societies from functioning in the way they did back when healthcare was essentially too cheap to meter in the US or any relatively free economy. 

Telling me how you where saved by socialised heathcare isnt really a good argument for it. At least no more than it would be for someone living in a dictatorship arguing that they would starve if the king did not supply bread to the peasants. I would not argue that a peasant should reject the free food but I would also point out that the king can afford it because they steal the production from the peasants in the first place or make it illegal for the peasants to grow their own. In the case of healthcare that would be the restricted supply of doctors and other heathcare professionals brought about by organisations like the AMA and the state power that has been granted to them to enact those restrictions. Heathcare is not immune to the effects of supply and demand. If you give out state monopolies in heathcare and insurance then those organisations can extract monopoly rents. When the state steps forward to ""fix"" that problem without relieving the underlying cause of the high prices ie without undoing their intervention to fix low wages for doctors then the fix may help on a case by case basis but systemically the problem is still there. Full socialism may actually be better in comparison if they can at the same time scrap the rent seeking organisation but you are still left with a government bureaucracy rather than a competitive marketplace. Rely on politicians for long enough to provide a service and you can even be forgiven for not believing that basic things like toilet paper and food can be produced privately cheaper and better but far worse then that you get a stagnation. Name one industry that continues to innovate after being nationalised?

You do realise that this breaks insurance right? I mean who would buy fire insurance if you could buy it after your house is on fire? I have no sympathy for the state supported insurance industry but policies forcing them to ignore pre existing conditions will bankrupt them and so you get either people being forced to pay or full nationalisation as a result of the state policy that you will no doubt call the free market.

"> No, that's how you sell things that nobody wants or needs.

Obviously the schools felt that they wanted/needed them.  Otherwise, they wouldn't have opted to buy them.

Meanwhile, I do have multiple family members who use Chromebooks as their daily drivers because they can't afford much more than that (and also don't have the technical know-how to deal with Windows malware, maintenance, etc.).  They demonstrably want/need them.

> Chromebooks is a google product. They don't manufacture it, they very much designed its directives. Android phones on the other hand are indeed not their own hardware (mostly follow Apple directives).

Google actually applies a similar degree of design constraints to Android devices - or more accurately, besides maybe the keyboard layout, Google really doesn't impose a whole lot on manufacturers (certainly no more than they do for Android).  Manufacturers stuck to the cheap netbook design because that's the form factor and market to which ChromeOS caters, but there's not much (to my knowledge) stopping a manufacturer from shipping ChromeOS on mid-range or high-end laptops if they chose to do so (and Google in fact does do so with the Pixelbook, which is actually a fantastic laptop, or at least seems to be based on the handful of times I've played around with one; Samsung and HP also offer mid-range Chromebooks, as do Lenovo and Dell for the enterprise markets, IIRC).

Of course, ChromeOS *is* tailored to cheap netbooks, and schools do seem to like them specifically because they're cheap (and also because ChromeOS has a lot of enterprise-grade management features - including some tailored specifically for schools - that make it really easy to deploy and maintain a fleet of Chromebooks on a school-wide or district-wide level; Apple's management solutions for iOS are lacking in comparison, though they've certainly gotten better, probably in response to Chromebooks making inroads at schools).

Yeah, there are better laptops out there, but Chromebooks do serve their purpose relatively well.

>Who is shopping around for an ER while they're in an emergency situation? How is that a free market?

The same people who would shop around for fire insurance  when their house is burning. Thats not an argument for eliminating competition for emergancy care since the actual thing you shop around for is in the specific case of emergency care is insurance and its vitally important that you are not forced to pay for insurance because if you are that breaks the insurance model just as much as insurance companies being forced to provide coverage after the cost is known. 

But look you are acting like charity doesn't exist while at the same time arguing that people should be forced to fix this situation. If people dont want to fix this situation its a bad argument for it being a law and if they do want to fix this situation then its a case for a combination of charity and individuals taking responsibility for their own lives / costs. Again you are not thinking this in the context of how much cheaper a mutual aid system was. I mean emergancy care was essentially free if you paid your one days worth of wages for the years worth of heathcare. An actual free market is like in heathcare can be as different as a supermarket in a capitalist country vs one in a communist country. You mistake is in thinking we are in a capitalist system when it comes to healthcare costs when we are not.

Its not so much that innovation regresses under socialism beyond cases of societal collapse its more that innovation just crawls to a stop. I mean in the words of Bernie sanders who needs 12 kinds of deodorant? Its really that mindset that takes over when there are no new companies coming in trying to disrupt things. Socialism is a literally a corporation. Why would you expect a corporation to innovate if no one is trying to put it out of business and it gets paid no matter what?  I mean there might be individuals working in a large monopolistic corporation that are still creative but the history of disruptive technology is these people fighting the established players and that has not historically worked all that well when the corporation is the state.

"> ""Look, compared to other systems, here why it doesn't suck so bad.""

Sure thats fine although its not the frame of comparison I was making. 

>That's not shopping around for ""fire insurance,"" at that point it's shopping around for the cheapest fire department. Nobody has time to shop around in the case of an emergency. There's a difference between ""insurance"" and ""emergency services,"" but you're just going to conflate the two?

Where did I say that people have time to shop around for insurance during an emergency? There are solutions to the problem of emergency care that do not however turn every one into the person being shaken down by the situation. It might suck for the individuals that didnt pay their cheap mutual aid fees and who literally no one including crowd funding services charities and credit providers want to pick up the tab for but why do they get to point the guns of the state at anyone? Again in a free market system high prices have never been a barrier to heathcare, the high prices are an artefact of state intervention and are kind of universal. Also there is always going to be a point where even the state cuts people off for chronic care that a free market system could keep alive due to again mutual aid being historically orders of magnitude cheaper. I could just as well go into a frantic moral panic about why you want these people to die by promoting a flawed economic model!!1!

>BRB, going to start calling around to different charities to figure out which ones will help me pay for the ambulance I can't afford before I call them. Oh, and figuring out which ambulance provider will put me the least in debt. Don't mind the fact that I'm in blinding pain and the adrenaline pumping barely has me able to work my phone, I just need to make a few calls!

An ambulance ride should cost literally no more than a taxi ride in a free market and taxi rides are already so inflated by licencing and taxes that the cost could be much less than that. I mean seriously I know people who would catch an uber for emergency drive to the hospital because their chances of dying waiting for an ambulance are higher than just going with a responsive lower regulated service. This is another case of the state breaking your legs and providing free crutches. 


>Insurance is offered as an employment perk in a competitive industry.

Yes but why? do you know the history of why that started? isnt it kind of stupid to have your employer buy your insurance? Why wouldnt you just take money instead and choose your own insurance? That sort of deal got started because the government in the US and various other countries started capping peoples salaries because socialism and companies used bonuses to get around that because why pay good workers less if you want to have them? Mandated insurance came after and in response to that. These things change rather rapidly though and can differ by state because not every state is full of people dumb enough to think a government solution to a government problem is a great idea vs undoing the  the first intervention. In any case once an insurance company starts getting mandated customers why even bother to provide anything for  anyone else? That would be like a politician for filling promises after his already been elected.  I mean they might out of kindness but they dont have to. 

>Because that's the system you're advocating for. You're the one saying the ""SOCIALISM"" of the ACA is bad, and we need to return to a pre-ACA world. That's a world where I wouldn't have gotten insurance coverage for my knee injury.

Not before the ACA, before the AMA and I'm only advocating for no free stuff from government in the sense that I dont think bread should be provided by the state for free but rather so cheap that bread lines are a ridiculous proposal. I want healthcare to be so cheap that its not a problem to be insured for emergency care and irresponsible to not pay a few dollars for a year worth of a doctors service. Thats the opposite of wanting people to die in the streets because they are too poor to pay for their heathcare. So cheap that its not a burden on charities to provide for those rare cases where someone good has no one who is willing or able to support them. I dont want to take away peoples ability to support their friends and family just to sell it back to them through the political process. Thats how the system also pays for war, because if you dont pay your taxes which fund killing people in far off lands you want to see people die on the streets for lack of being able to afford emergency care. Well I do pay for the healthcare of my family already when they need it and would help a friend in need I dont need their care being held hostage so that I pay taxes for all the things I morally object to. Maybe socialised healthcare is a thing I value. You seem to be missing the fact that I'm advocating for mutual aid which is a collectivist / leftist social technology. One that seems to have been abandoned by the left in favour of nationalism.  I'm not against voluntary socialism otherwise known as charity. but you dont seem to think people want to help others which is why you are arguing against basically the same thing but in a less violent form. because some how the operators of governments are more altruistic than the operators of charities who are literally paid to provide the service they want to provide and even if they dont they would get cut off if they wasted the money the way governments do on things like war.         


>Well the free market health insurance industry did!

you mean heavily state controlled insurance that is mandated for things it makes no sense for insurance to be for and restricted in forms that make sense with state control over who is buying and who is selling to various degrees.  A totally free market system that is double plus bad.

"> Also your statista link clearly shows Apple as the top sellers

Yeah, on an individual basis.  Combined, Android tablets outsell iPads rather significantly, as the Statista link clearly shows.

> Heck even content creation is set to get a boost with full Photoshop being released this year or the next.

I highly doubt it will really be ""full"".  Even if it is, I highly doubt it'll run acceptably well even on an iPad Pro, let alone on a non-Pro iPad.

> I am mostly certain that iPad has most if not all the necessary tools to manage , create (basic stuff) and especially consume.

Of course it does (wasn't always the case, but it certainly is now).  So do Chromebooks, Android tablets, etc., and at better price points.

> Even its cost advantage is mostly eliminated by the latest iPad line (non pros) which can be found for $300 (a bit above or below depending on the version).

I can pick up a [ruggedized Chromebook](https://smile.amazon.com/Chromebook-C202SA-YS01-Ruggedized-Resistant-Celeron/dp/B01DBGVB5C) for more than $100 less than even the cheapest new iPads, and it'll be able to handle a lot more abuse from careless/reckless students/teachers than an iPad ever will (unless Apple starts breaking from its typical design language and makes ruggedized hardware, which is unlikely); hell, it's specifically designed and marketed for classroom use.  Sure, you can get ruggedized cases for iPads, but students can remove cases a lot more easily than they can un-ruggedize an actually-ruggedized laptop.  I ain't a huge Celeron fan, but it's perfectly fine for classwork (I've seen far worse out there).  2GB of RAM is exactly on-par with the $300 iPads (and there's a 4GB option that's still way cheaper than an iPad).

That price advantage is by no means eliminated on an individual level even.  If we multiply that by, say, 20 students in a classroom (and that's conservative, knowing US class sizes these days, but hey, maybe things are different abroad), that's $2,000 saved right off the bat, plus additional money saved through the lifetime of the laptops due to wear and tear being less of an issue.  That $2,000+ can thus go right back into other classroom supplies.

> portrait mode for reading (a thing you would think schools would need)

ChromeOS itself supports portrait mode just fine, and the 2-in-1 laptop/tablet hybrids even support auto-rotate.  [Lenovo sells such Chromebooks](https://smile.amazon.com/Lenovo-Chromebook-11-6-Inch-1366x768-Chrome/dp/B074MJHTRS/), and like the ASUS one linked above, they're ruggedized and cheaper than iPads (though not *as* cheaper; the touchscreen does add a little bit of a premium).

> you have to use a compatibility layer to install play apps

I haven't personally tried it yet (my last foray with Chromebooks was before Android compatibility launched, though I might pick up a Pixelbook while they're on sale on Amazon), but I've heard it actually works pretty well (aside from the typical issues with shoehorning touch-centric apps into a keyboard/mouse world, though that's less of an issue on the convertible and tablet-only Chromebooks).  Not surprising, really; ChromeOS and Android are both Linux-based, so it's possible to stick the Android runtime in a container and go from there.  [Anbox](https://anbox.io/) is an example of this generalized to traditional GNU/Linux instead of ChromeOS (with some significant differences, e.g. the lack of a Play Store and fewer exceptions to the sandbox).";1;0;False;northrupthebandgeek;e4vmz7m;Will this ever happen?;9a6qnw;https://i.redd.it/k40rw8ncq8i11.jpg
"Have you seen the intransigence of conservatives?

Abortion in pretty much all forms, [even to save the life of the mother](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-20321741), was banned until recently.

Here in the US one of the people competing to be a Senator to represent my state argued that man-made climate change isn't real, and opposed anti-climate-change action because ""[we cannot change the way the sun operates.](https://www.mprnews.org/story/2018/08/22/sen-amy-klobuchar-and-state-rep-jim-newberger-debate-minnesota-senate-election)""

Hell, less than ten years ago we took at stab at reforming our healthcare system. Even after The Public Option (allowing people to buy into existing government health insurance programs) was stripped out, even after Death Panels (reimbursing doctors for time spent talking to patients about living wills and advance care directives) were stripped out, even after state level Medicaid expansions were made optional (rather than mandatory), it was still derided as ""SOCIALIST!!!!""

After its implementation it was blamed for ruining people's lives, with politicians parading around [families (purportedly) ""hurt by Obamacare""](https://waysandmeans.house.gov/words-obamacare-hurts-americans-walks-life/), despite the fact that many of them wouldn't have had health insurance without the ACA. They blamed increasing insurance premiums on the ACA, despite the fact that the rate of increase was lower than it had been prior to the implementation of the ACA. They even tried to blame the technical glitches of the ACA website during it's inaugural run as proof the ACA could never work, despite the fact that the only states that were impacted by these problems were the ones refusing to implement as much of the ACA as they could.

The entire Republican party campaigned to remove the ACA and dedicate itself to a ""market-based"" approach (though they never did explain WTF that means, given that the vast majority of people who gained insurance under the ACA gained it through the private insurance market).

Barring the total collapse of the Republican party and conservatives failing to establish any kind of political coalition to replace them as a power bloc, there is absolutely no way in hell this country will have universal healthcare by 2025. Especially when the President's loudest, most loyal, most active segment of the base is out there comparing universal healthcare to Stalinist collectivization.

"> I don't mind pay taxes if they are used well

And there we have the most widely ignored and dismissed argument for things like universal healthcare.

Opponents of UHC paint supporters as ""just wanting free stuff that isn't really free,"" when in reality I don't think there's a single person who's argued in favor of universal healthcare that hasn't recognized it is not free. For the most part everyone will pay for it, nobody is denying that.

The point isn't ""free stuff,"" the point is about paying the lowest cost for the same services for the most people. It's about spending our money in the most efficient way possible. It's like buying in bulk.

I can go down to my local grocery store and get 2lbs of chicken for about $6. And we all can go to our preferred stores, and buy our own chickens. Some will pay $6, others pay $8, some may only pay $5. Or we can group together and go down to CostCo and buy one of those big things of multiple servings of chicken, all of us chip in, and split it up for a net cost of $3 for the same amount of chicken. And as an effect, my friend who may only have $4 can now afford to buy chicken.

It might *look like* we subsidized his chicken, like... [̲̅S̲̅][̲̅O̲̅][̲̅C̲̅][̲̅I̲̅][̲̅A̲̅][̲̅L̲̅][̲̅I̲̅][̲̅S̲̅][̲̅M̲̅], but who cares what it looks like?

"> Being the best pile of shit isnt exactly something to be proud of

[Have you seen our infant mortality rate](http://time.com/5090112/infant-mortality-rate-usa/)? Our healthcare system ain't that great.

ER docs first diagnosed me with a sprained knee. Brought me in, they were able to flex my knee (which hurt, *a lot more*, when they did it) no obvious bone damage, no nerve damage because I could feel all the way down to my toes, you know what they decided to do? Eh, let's give 'im an X-Ray. Gave me some ibuprofen, sold me some crutches, and sent me on my way.

I received six bills for my ER visit. One from the Emergency Room in the hospital, one from the subcontractor that ran the X-Ray, one from the subcontractor that sold me the crutches and the ibuprofen, and three from my insurance company (several weeks after the first round of bills) telling me what portion they'd pay for each bill. Oh, and parking, I was fortunate enough to have family living nearby, and they drove me to the ER, but they covered the parking costs. And Thank goodness they were there for me, because from what I understand from a friend who once had to avail himself of an ambulance, that would have set me back just shy of an additional $10,000.

After a week of being unable to support any weight on my knee, and still being in pain whenever I flexed it, I went and sought out the services of an orthopedic specialist. Thank goodness I have a family member who is a nurse, otherwise I wouldn't have known that it was an orthopedic specialist that I needed, as opposed to some other kind of specialist.

It would be another week before I could get an MRI, and a week after that before they could tell me what was going on. Four more bills: one for the MRI, one for someone to read the MRI and tell me what it said and to recommend a course of treatment, and two from the insurance company.

Now at this point it has been **four weeks** that I have been unable to walk. I had to borrow a family member's car because I couldn't work the clutch in mine. Thank goodness I had a job I could do while sitting down. I was rediagnosed with a torn ACL, partially torn MCL, torn meniscus, and damage to the bone that the initial X-Ray had not detected. They drained my knee of fluid, and set up an appointment for me to be fitted with a knee brace, the following week.

So **five weeks** on crutches, and insurance didn't fully cover my knee brace either. Two more bills for that one. Thank goodness I had family that could drive me to the ER, and that they could swap cars with me until I could put pressure on my knee again, rental cars would have been a bitch, and I'd risk having my own car be impounded if I just left it in the lot for several weeks.

And thank goodness I had an accommodating employer, who let me work from home when my schedule demanded it, and helped make accommodations so I could more safely get in and out of places around the building, and were just generally willing to help me out.

Oh, and thank goodness I had insurance, which would have otherwise been denied to me without the ACA because of my migraines and history of asthma, pesky pre-existing conditions, otherwise I would have been deep in the hole.

And this was not just some cosmetic thing, like getting braces, or getting a pair of prescription sunglasses, this was my ability to stand on my own two goddamn feet. My ability to climb stairs in a timely matter, to use a ladder, reach for things up high, and carry them on my own.

Five weeks before I got the care I needed to start to heal. About a dozen bills, totaling several thousands of dollars of pre-insurance value. Great system. Totally no inefficiencies and excessive overhead there! Free Market is doing an awesome job.

This meme says more to me about current US healthcare than it does about Bitcoin. To someone used to the US health system, the joke is about the dollar being replaced by Bitcoin in the future. To anyone else, what sticks out first is that it's apparently completely acceptable to charge people for medical attention, and also to inform them as they're waking up from a coma. Obviously the latter is done to get to the dollar/Bitcoin joke in frame, but it sticks out so badly to a non-US resident that it ruins the intended gag for me.;9;1;False;a1studmuffin;e4u0kea;Will this ever happen?;9a6qnw;https://i.redd.it/k40rw8ncq8i11.jpg

"Yep, I'd say this is correct. The UK switched over from the old system of Pounds, Shillings and Pence to a Decimalized system, and folks adjusted. Not quite the same thing, but the NYSE used to quote everything in fractions, now it's decimalized. Canada and Europe switched from Imperial measurements to (mostly) metric.

I, myself, had to adjust to something like this. When I was in school and had to do any video engineering, everything was in Standard Definition, and was measured in [IRE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRE_\(unit\)). Then when I started working on HD material everything was measured in millivolts. 700mV? WTF is that in IRE? Thankfully every piece of gear had both units on it at the time, so I could quickly adjust. Now it's just all mV for me, and whenever I see IRE listed in a spec sheet I know someone hasn't updated their documentation in a long time.

It's the big numbers part that'll throw people. Having to keep track of how many zeroes there are gets a little tricky after four or so. Folks might standardized on a sub-unit, kinda like the Satoshi, or they might just get used to scientific notation. 3.1×10^(9).";1;0;False;Kichigai;e4v2fej;Will this ever happen?;9a6qnw;https://i.redd.it/k40rw8ncq8i11.jpg

"Again I can't see how can that be the case. I cannot go in case by case comparisons but I am mostly certain that iPad has most if not all the necessary tools to manage , create (basic stuff) and especially consume. 

Heck even content creation is set to get a boost with full Photoshop being released this year or the next. Apple really do caters to software developers, especially those exclusive to her platform(s).

And to be clear I do not think that the iPad is an ideal situation, I am merely comparing it to Chromebooks. Which typically come with lower end chipset , less software support (actually) way lower battery, better keyboard (but you do have a choice of keyboard in iPads some of which are quite good), no portrait use, quite heavier. It is pretty much a nightmare.

Even its cost advantage is mostly eliminated by the latest iPad line (non pros) which can be found for $300 (a bit above or below depending on the version).

Also your statista link clearly shows Apple as the top sellers and quite possibly at higher average costs too.

I can agree that ipads may not be ideal for schools because of their locked down nature, but bringing back netbooks was/is certainly not the answer either. Google has to rework android tablets, to allow them have a keyboard for typing and a portrait mode for reading (a thing you would think schools would need) and finally merge the damn OSes instead of confusing everybody by having two very similar OSes that are also mostly incompatible (you have to use a compatibility layer to install play apps).
