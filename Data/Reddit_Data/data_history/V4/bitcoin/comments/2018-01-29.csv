"The basic model is releasing two versions.  A free and open source version and an enterprise version.  The enterprise version has a nice GUI and support.

With this project, it is a glorified cryptocurrency wallet.  Is it safe?  The developer says yes and you can use wireshark to verify.  That is not verifiable.  Say he set an event, if BTC price reaches 21,000 USD collect all to his private wallet.  Use software you can trust.

As long as you abide by the terms of the license in question, it means both of those things. In fact the [Open Source definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Source_Definition) explicitly requires it:

> ""The license shall not restrict any party from **selling** or **giving away** the software""

You can copy and sell someone else's open source software, *and* someone else can give it away for free, and the licenses require that both of those cases be allowed.

One of the main barriers to becoming rich selling other people's open source is that you're competing with free sources of the same program. That's why people will often hide the origins of the source code, at which point they're in violation of the license.

"> I know it doesnt mean you can openly steal the code

It depends on the open source license that's used. Some licenses, like MIT and BSD, allow you to do pretty much anything you want with the code, including sell it.

They only require that you include the original copyright notice (which tells you who owns the copyright) and license text. So taking the code of a BSD or MIT license app, building it, and selling the app is fine as long as the app includes the copyright notice.

Other licenses, like GPL, require that you make the source code available to any users of the application - and if you modify the code, that you make the source to those modifications available under the terms of the GPL license. Even in that case, you can legally take the source of a GPL app, build it, and sell it, as long as you make the source code available.

The catch for a would-be ""thief"" in both these situations is that, if you include the info about where the source code came from, or provide the source code, you significantly reduce the ability to profit from selling it unmodified. So ""theft"" in this case involves hiding the origin of the code, thus violating the license and potentially making more money from people who don't realize that they can get the same thing for free elsewhere.

Basically just make the background 100% black. It looks so good on OLED phones and as a graphic designer I really love apps that have such a feature.

"Weird that you found Android to be more buggy. I remember reading a report a handful of years ago talking about how iOS apps crashed more frequently than their Android counterparts, but everyone has slightly different experiences.

As for Android being ahead, here are some features Android had before iOS (some are still exclusive to my knowledge):
Widgets
Notification shade
Custom keyboards
Being able to set custom apps as defaults (don't open Safari when I click a link, open Chrome)
Multitasking
Multi-windows
Grouped notifications
Multiple users
Smart unlock
Back button
Many new features are built as apps instead of built directly into the OS itself, so even if your phone doesn't get the update you'll still get a decent amount of the new features rather than being forced to upgrade. 

That's all just software (aside from the back button, which is now just software). There's also:
Multiple phone sizes (Apple always said ""People don't want bigger phones"" while people were constantly begging them for a bigger phone)
Water/dust resistance
Wireless charging
Fast charging
Haptic feedback

At least some of these things definitely came out on third party phones/custom OS's, but I think that's just another pro in Android's column.

I also think iOS is incredibly unintuitive and think things on Android are far more likely to just work the way they're supposed to, but to each their own.

"First off, great work! Committing to a project and seeing it through is a big accomplishment regardless of how many people use it.

I think the UI could be more intuitive: For example, when I wanted to create a new entry in my wallet, I clicked on the Amount field and since the first field already said ""BTC"", when I tried to ""Add"", I got the ""Something is missing"" error. I think you need to think about your UX a bit. Make the first field a drop-down that says ""Please select"", so the user understands to automatically select something first and then enter a value before hitting Add.

Same holds true for ""Watch Only"".

"I am making an app too, made a youtube video on the beta, check my posts.

Heres some advice, some may have already been mentioned:

- Change the title. Next time, you need to sell it like your mother's life depended it, without lying ofcourse.
- Don't make it open-source. If people are really skeptic, hit me up and I will run a network sniffer, to see if you do anything suspicious with the app. As soon as you make this open source, there will be 10 different versions of your app, with a different background colour and maybe a random number after the original name.

- It was a good idea to release it as a beta, so people know what they are getting themselves into, when you monetize, the beta would have been like the free trial.

- On monetisation, I think you should not put in any ads, one problem I had with my app was putting in ads, it completely ruined my interface and I removed it.

- A good monetisation idea, would be to limit the amount of Exchanges to something like 10. Or if you are stubborn on ads, put in custom ads that you can control. I'm sure you can find some sponsors.

Nice man. The one thing I hate about every crypto tracking app is there is no option to add 'mined' vs. 'bought'. So tracking profitability is always off. It'd be nice if when you add a 'trade' you have options 'Buy' 'Sell' and 'Mined'. Then put in cost of electricity and amount of coins mined, then add to portfolio.

"> Why is the network less congested now?

One theory is that the earlier network congestion is not entirely caused by genuine transactions but by deliberate spam. The spammer has a political agenda to either raise bitcoin's block size via a hard fork (a backwards incompatible change) or to make more people use another coin called Bitcoin Cash or BCash (BCH) which has a higher maximum block size limit (raising block size would allow more transactions and would reduce fees due to less competition for space). However people are now starting to experiment with a new technology called 'Lightning Network' (LN) which offers instant transactions at near zero fees. LN can run on top of Bitcoin but not BCH. Seeing high fees is pushing people to use LN and not BCH the spammer stopped spamming.";1;0;False;lonely_guy0;dtedo75;Bitcointalk's famous user Loaded moved his 40k BTC stash to a native SegWit address. $1 in fee to move $400M+.;7tcmi4;https://twitter.com/khannib/status/957186970672947200

Weird.  How about not being insane, and instead understanding the technical merits of both viewpoints?

But we don’t live in caves anymore. And your life isn’t it risk. So you can actually take a more rational, moderate position on things. 

Lightning network is going to serve a purpose and I pray that it gets adopted like crazy!

"> IT IS MY POINT

>>They could have called it splitcoin: a bitcoin fork. Forkcoin. bitfork. Anything would have been fine, however, they chose a name to intentionally confuse people into believing they are bitcoin.

Forgive me for confusing what your point is, considering ""your point"" seems to switch depending on what I'm pointing out. I also don't imagine you insisting on callind it ""bcash"" has anything to do with the fact that it's got ""bitcoin"" in the name, and that bothers you, does it?

> Whether people had a problem before the fork or not is in the past and irrelevant

How so? So when ""the past"" directly contradicts your narrative, it's ""in the past and irrelevant""? How does that even work?

>  Your claims are so spurious, such as growth and organic (thanks for the laugh) it doesn't even deserve a response. 

I made no claims. I asked **a question**, trying to pinpoint what your actual claims are, since you continue changing them. A question you're conveniently failing to address.

I don't agree with 'bitcoin.com', etc, and anyone who deliberately tries to conflate bitcoin with bcash. But that doesn't make the concept of bcash fraud, it just makes Roger Ver an asshole.

"While you present a more cogent argument than the others that have replied, you're still attempting to construct a narrative that presents Bcash as Bitcoin, by appealing to the idea of a ""True Scotsman"" or ""original vision"", while ignoring the various changes and improvements that were developed and implemented in the Bitcoin network in the years after the whitepaper was released.  In order for that argument to work, many changes and points of progress would have to be stripped from the project, but that of course won't happen as the argument is just a cheap ploy, not an honest appeal. Just as you try to insert the false idea concerning a store of value or a peer to peer cash, which bitcoin is both.


As to the naming convention, it's a clear attempt at subversion and fraud.  The principle concept behind bitcoin is consensus, in many aspects of the project.  Bcash diverges from that principle as it was a clear attempt to force  the preferences of one group over the rest of the community when no consensus could be reached over how a secure, acceptable scaling solution would be implemented.   Presenting the situation as anything else is dishonest just as the tactics used to try and trick others into believing bcash is bitcoin, Bcash is not bitcoin.  It's a clear use of propaganda tactics and has only served to hurt the entire crypto space.  All of this would be avoided by an honest attempt at adopting a name that is not intended to deceive, however the choice to name the fork bcash is indicative of the intentions of the main actors behind bcash.

Threads like this make this a hard argument to make.

> The problem is that they try to claim they are bitcoin and try to co-opt the hardwork of a community that built up a reputation for a secure network and protocol over years, by piggy backing off of the name.

This argument requires us to believe that most people using BCH would be stupid enough not to realize they're actually using something different than BTC. Again, I find an extremely difficult position to defend. 

It's fine not to support BCH. What's not OK is to try and pretend that all the anymosity for it stems from this ridiculous assumption that people are unbelievably stupid, and that the whole BCH value proposition boils down to try and con people into ""buying the wrong coin"". Heck from where I'm standing it seems the BCH community are proposing it being used for actual commerce, while the prevalent message on the bitcoin community is ""HODL no matter what"".

"**Burger King (Mattoon, Illinois)**

Burger King is a restaurant founded by the Hoots family and operated by Burger King LLC of Illinois in Mattoon, Illinois, United States; it is not related to the fast food chain Burger King. The restaurant's founders claim it is the ""original"" Burger King and predates the fast food chain. A 1968 court case between this restaurant and the larger Burger King chain is a well-known case in United States trademark law regarding the Lanham Act.

"Option 1: 

On the technical aspect, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is closer to being Bitcoin, to use the extra on chain space you don't need to do anything.

To use all the new Bitcoin (BTC)  features you need to move all your funds to some kind of new address, so I conclude _cash is the true Bitcoin _

Option 2:

Bitcoin holds the name and implemented new features, they also hold the most hashrate and the same dev team, so I conclude _Bitcoin is the true Bitcoin _

Option 3:

You realize there's no such thing as ""The true Bitcoin"" so you invest in both thinking both approaches are worth a shot! You choose right and get a free lambo.

"> Trying to dent or reshape the spirits of creativity in youth in hope that they will conform to your idea of morality.

I wish someone had gotten to me way earlier to nudge me away from worshipping corporations and money as I'd been brainwashed to do as a child.  I wish it hadn't taken until my late 20's to hear some really strong voices about how insane the pursuit of money makes us.  I did hear other non-mainstream voices when I was a teenager, and those helped shape me into a far healthier and more respectful and aware woman I am today.  So I think while insulting someone is clearly not useful for trying to help them see a more enlightened perspective, reshaping teenagers away from the unhealthy memes of the old school corporations and governments is a very healthy thing.";2;0;False;Turil;dte76sb;I'm 16 and I made an app that will help you trade bitcoin and other cryptos.;7tl7gi;https://i.redd.it/kozgjoj65uc01.gif

"Really really impressive stuff. Bought your app and plan on using it! Fellow iOS dev here. A couple tips: 

For the loading wheel, those you can apply constraints to, so you can just apply some horizontal constraints to center it. 

Secondly for the initial load, I saw your comment about a caching server. That’s a great idea, but it’s more infrastructure for you to run. I would do a lazy load on the crypto prices, so run an API call for the first few items, and then display those while the others load in. This way the likely most relevant information will be displayed promptly to the user and they can wait for some of the more obscure cryptos. Additionally I would make the table non-empty to begin with. Start the app by listing all the cryptos by name, and then fill in the price data asynchronously.

"The only feature all these apps are missing is helping with tax declaration in Germany. In order not to pay taxes on my Crypto investments, I need to hold my coins for at least a year. It’d be a killer feature for an app to show me which amount of coins I am able to sell right now without paying taxes for it, and for how much exactly that amount was purchased and when. It is quite hard to keep track of the “left overs” that exist with this law, since all the movements are calculated first in, first out. 

Do you see this as a possible feature in the near future? I’d pay some money for an app that can do that (and I would recommend it to all my fellow german Crypto friends).

I think it's awesome you are making waves like this at the age of 16. Knowledge of crypto, + coding apps for it at such a young age, there's no reason you shouldn't become a millionaire if you hodl and keep at the app creation. One suggestion, you should add sms notification in a later version that could be a separate higher cost version of the app. I'm an Android user so will definitely look forward to that version. I've read some of the previous critiques and if implemented + correctly, you may force other app devs to up their game. Keep it up young man, and much success to you!;0;0;False;clockwork360;dteg7qv;I'm 16 and I made an app that will help you trade bitcoin and other cryptos.;7tl7gi;https://i.redd.it/kozgjoj65uc01.gif
