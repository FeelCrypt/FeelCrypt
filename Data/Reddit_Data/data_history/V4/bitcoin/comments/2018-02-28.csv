"The Fistula Foundation is an amazing charity that has the highest rating on Charity Navigator and saves the lives of women across Africa.  This is their summary:

We believe that no woman should suffer a life of isolation and misery simply for trying to bring a child into the world, which is why we are dedicated to ending the suffering caused by obstetric fistula. We're working with local partners in more than 20 countries, funding more fistula repair surgeries worldwide than any other organization. Based in San Jose, California, in the heart of Silicon Valley, Fistula Foundation is honored to have received 12 consecutive four-star ratings from Charity Navigator; only 1 percent of charities have received this designation.";2;0;False;IAmElleHeller;duxrdyi;I'm donating 5057 BTC to charitable causes!

The Fistula Foundation helps women who have suffered debilitating birth trauma get their life back. An obstetric fistula is a hole in the birth canal often from necrotic tissue after the baby gets stuck for a long period of time. The baby usually dies, so there is that trauma, but then the woman can't hold her urine and feces anymore so she stinks all the time and is rejected by her husband and community. For like $400 this condition can be repaired and this woman has a new lease on life. I think its amazing. I had a traumatic birth experience and would have been one of these women but for western medicine and quick access to a c-section. You can put a life back together for just $400 per woman.;2;0;False;ladyjade3;duypq5y;I'm donating 5057 BTC to charitable causes!

Lood no further than the Fistula Foundation, a charity that helps unfortunate women, in the most remote areas of the world. This fund, which has a minuscule expense ratio puts all of its funds into corrective surgery for women with obstetrical fistula. Women with this condition are often ostracized from their family and village. There is a lot more work to be done. ;2;0;False;Jmcglade;duxquzs;I'm donating 5057 BTC to charitable causes!

"If you check out the Fistula Foundation, I think that you will find that they make extremely good use of the funds that they receive.  It takes about $600 to do the surgery that transforms a young woman from a social outcast to a completely restored member of her local society.  This has an impact on the lives of her children and family/extended family for the remainder of her life.   Please consider this highly rated charity for a gift.

And thanks for doing what you are doing with the pineapple fund.......

One last thought - this is kind of 'out there' but there is a profoundly disadvantaged population of indigenous people who are facing the same kind of annihilation threats that Native Americans  faced a hundred years ago.  There are just over 300 million people on the planet who know how to live in non-destructive harmony with nature.  There is an organization ""Survival International""  that intervenes legally on behalf of efforts to leave indigenous people alone.  I personally believe that this profoundly under-funded organization is worthy of much greater support.  If I were fortunate enough to be in your position, they would be a major benefactor.

"Isn't this my point exactly.

Let's not even go with a Camry here, let's go with a Corolla or a Civic. The Corolla does it's job ADEQUATELY at an entry point in delivering a person from destination A to destination B. The Mercedes E Class does the same, but it does it better given say, a smoother ride or a more luxurious and comfortable interior.

Of course they're different, but it's not really apples and oranges. A poor person who wants to play games on a PC will potentially resort to the APU to get the job done. The APUs get the job done ADEQUATELY. It's not elegant, graphics suck at low, but modern games are still PLAYABLE (30-40+ fps). 
For some people, this is all they need. I know that this used to be me before I could afford any of the parts I have today.

"I talk about crypto and you immediately jump to just talking about Bitcoin? That's indicative. 

You don't understand traditional currency very well if you think it's not a problem. Our country is about to be $21 trillion in debt largely because of our ability to inflate money to limitless amounts. That has consequences. Major consequences. 10 years ago the people saying that the NSA spying on us were also labelled crazy too, so please, keep maintaining your viewpoint of the traditional system being well functioning and without issue. Or you're welcome to actually research the banking-currency system beyond a surface understanding.

Banks no longer have a reason d'etre if crypto succeeds. Pretending that they'll ""adapt it for their own uses"" and still remain necessary at the scale they exist at now is contradictory.

You also talk about flaws that are ""due to original design"" whilst touting banks' ability to adapt it to their own designs. Which is it? Is crypto modifiable or not? You talk a lot of crap, but it's not based in a significant amount of integral and objective understanding of the applicability of the technology. You're just fitting crypto into the status quo financial worldview that you believe needs little reform. Why you feel the need to label me insane in order to believe what you want to is beyond. I don't care if you choose to brush major issues with the present system under the rug, but the need to call people insane to prove your point should indicate to you that you don't have a good enough argument against something that you feel strongly about.

An irrefutable point beyond issues with banking oligarchies' power grabs:

I sent $20 of Stellar to Australia in 10 minutes for $0.000004, with zero chance of a PayPal charge back. Care to inform me of any better way to transfer value across borders?

"It might be possible that a small number of women in a team is beneficial, but I remember clearly the study about balancing males and females in management which had 0 effect on profits (virtually no correlation).

It's also worth noting that a feminist woman tried running only-women development company (firing guys) and it had so terrible results (real toxicity among most of the women) that she was forced to reconsider, fire badly performing women (majority) and hired people based on only skill. Unsurprisingly (at least for me) she ended up with a company almost full of guys.

While Google should be ""for profit"", leaked ""recommendations"" for managers for hiring does not suggest that. Managers who didn't meet diversity quota (not only females, but also skin color, not sure if anything else) were being punished. Effectively forcing managers to lower their hiring requirements for women just to get some women aboard. (And now a group of women is suing Google for lower wage compared to men, because Google probably didn't want to pay same money for worse results.)

If you actually know some study suggesting that gender balanced developer teams perform better, then please link it. I haven't been able to find any. Which of course doesn't mean there aren't any, but it would a bit surprising, since it would contradict real life experiments with forcibly balanced teams which didn't turned out well (were performing a lot worse than non-balanced teams; again, I think it was a Swedish experiment documented on video, at least parts of it are on YouTube).";1;1;False;monnef;duyfs7s;"""The barriers to entry for tech are very low compared to any other professional field.

Most programmers do not need much more than 8th grade level math to do their jobs effectively. If you plan to get into crypto, well then I'd say cyptography is a good area to study. Not once in my career have I needed to use geometry, trigonometry, calculus, etc. Maybe some basic algebra came in handy a few times, but not much more than that.

That's because they want someone with experience not a graduate. Find graduate roles, they are specifically searching for zero experience people. If they want some experience for entry level, it means that they specifically do not want a graduate who they have to teach Day 1 on the job skills.

If graduate roles don't exist in your field and in your area, then move. It is not the markets purpose to find you a job. It is your purpose to go to where the market will give you a job.

"Dude, after reading your post I think you should DEFINITELY move.

Granted, there are about 1000 odds and ends that I'm not privy to that make moving a very cumbersome and difficult task, easier said than done, I know. 

However, from the sounds of it, you are way overqualified for your job, it doesn't interest you, and it sounds like there isn't a lot of upward mobility anyway. 

Think about your life when you're old, do you think you'd be happier with your decision to stick to living where you are, do the same boring thing everyday, not have any professional satisfaction, be susceptible to small town small company politics. (Piss off the guy's cousin and you never get promoted kinda thing). 

There's a whole world out there, especially in the cities. I'm not a CS professional so I can't give you a lot of advice there, but from what I can tell the job market where I live (Vancouver, Canada) is very favourable to anyone with development expertise. The last company I worked for hired a guy with 0 formal education and pretty much just did a technical test and was hired for UX. 

I would recommend you save up money, make a plan of attack, secure an average/mediocre job, and just 'network' aka talk to different people who might know of something or someone who could help you out. 

I am almost certain, that 1 year out, your career prospects will be vastly more suitable and exciting for you if you chose to move to a tech hub of some sort. 

You'd be surprised how quickly your life can change if you put yourself in the right situations. I like the quote ""life doesn't happen in your living room"" and I feel like working a tech job in a rural area is a figurative 'living room' and 'outside' is a place with much higher traffic like a city. Not hating on rural living at all, there's a great appeal, but cities are certainly advantageous for many reasons, being fun and exciting being one, and the opportunity to meet so many people outside of your small circle that can help lead you to new opportunities. 

Anyway, I say this a single guy that has moved around a few times, so I get that it's not that easy, especially with a kid and financial security being paramount. Still, if I were you, I would try to find a way to move to a city and have faith in your personality and skills that you can meet people who might be able to point you in a more favourable direction.

"All the material from my courses at University came from books and many tests and coursework are freely available and linked from professors webpages.

Not once was a professor / class NEEDED, but often going to university forces you to learn boring stuff you didn’t know you needed and to guide you to learn things you didn’t know exist.

This being said, I’d recommend University for the experience rather than education value.

"You will be Googling and reading ebooks for your entire career. Sure, you can do it without a degree, but 4 years of learning sort of pales in comparison to a 40\+ year career constantly learning.

"You say men created everything, let’s look back in history, say 500 years ago. Where only men were allowed to pursue academics and women were expected to birth babies and stay at home. That was the psychology of people all around the world for a very long time and even still in some places women don’t get the luxury to go to school or even get jobs. Now if they don’t get the opportunity to learn the basics of how the world works, how do you expect them to create  these “things” you speak of????

Your logic wasn’t bad but there are more variables at play, if you only look at the sheer amount of things that have been invented by men then one can conclude men are superior in that aspect since women didn’t invent much but where you went wrong was that you didn’t think as to why women didn’t invent things? Maybe something was inhibiting them to doing such....

But the surprising thing is you didn’t look at the education system today, in basically any class men and women compete at the same rate and have the same average score as the opposite sex. They both have roughly the same iq. Some geniuses, some in the middle and some far below.

I read your comments further below and it sounds like you just believed what you want to believe because of the things that you have gone through and I don’t blame you, I might have done the same if I was in Your place. It’s can be hard to look at the big picture but always question why something is the way it is.

"That's preposterous. I'm not going to go all freak out SJW on you, but that's somewhat of a dangerous line of thinking. 

I think you have to be careful not to dissuade women from pursuing their goals by reinforcing the idea that they won't be good at it. If that is the common narrative, then they will internalize that they aren't good at this and potentially reinforce the idea and prevent women who would be very capable or talented in CS from pursuing a degree. 

Sure, preference plays a role, natural ability could certainly be affected by biological factors, but to say ""women aren't good at X"" is kind of bullshit, if only if it dissuades the few or many who would like to pursue this topic but fear a stigma perpetuated by people like yourself, or worse yet that they believe it themselves. 

Variation within each sex is far too large to make broad statements like that. Sure, it's reasonable to not try and make everything 50/50 if that is not where the natural inclinations lie, but I still think it's not a good idea to make such generalizations about such a large population, particularly one that has been pushed down and aside for their entire history, who knows what women are capable of a few decades removed from that kind of social reinforcement.

"I am not asking for respect.

However, since you asked ...

I would like to think that I have generally kept the petty resentments of the people I have worked with throughout my career and my various jobs (who I may not have thought like or had the same preferences as) to myself and not slammed them so that I could cast myself as an aggrieved victim who should be consoled.

I don't know that I can claim that I have actually done that (generally kept the resentments to myself, as its hard to not give into resentment from time to time) but if I had, I would consider that an accomplishment that I could be proud of.
