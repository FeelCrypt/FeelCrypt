Palo Alto city controls all utilities including trash/recycle, everything comes on one bill.

"Thanks, I have a job. A family emergency hit out of nowhere and I had to sell some belongings and all my BTC and even borrow from friends and family (which I've never had to do in my life before), but I made it. The details of what happened wouldn't be interesting to strangers, and it wouldn't exactly fit in the title of a reddit post, so I summed it up as ""can't pay rent"", i.e. all my money is gone and I have to sell BTC to pay bills.

Unforeseen family emergency. I was a very early adopter, starting on bitcoin around late 2012. There have been three times since then that ridiculous circumstances have suddenly arisen to completely wipe out my holdings. Every single time it's been immediately before a massive price increase. Something just happened again to clear out everything I have.

"according to that source bitcoin mining uses 48 TWh today... this is way over estimated


watch this part of the my source where they explain exactly how they calculate their estimates:

https://youtu.be/QiHiUmixqH4?t=5487


a couple minutes later on this slide here you can see the lower and upper estimates for jan 11 2018:

https://youtu.be/QiHiUmixqH4?t=5769

low estimate 14 TWh, high estimate 27 TWh

the low estimate being mostly high efficiency miners and the high estimate being mostly older miners with worse efficiancy

their best guess is 18 TWh



i believe you when you say the NYT fact checks things carefully, but the problem with msm bitcoin news is that nobody in msm fucking knows anything about bitcoin so its really hard to fact check for them. they cant simply go ask their experts and their usual sources since they dont really know any better whats going on then I do (probably worse). theyd need to consult with crypto experts ( in this case miners ) to actually get some real answers but there are currently very few of those.

What the fuck are you talking about? You are saying blockchain did not exist before bitcoin? Did you even read the paper?  There are literally no reference to a blockchain as so in Satoshi's whitepaper. The only reference from Satoshi to block chain are in the actual code implementation of the bitcoin, so a year after the paper. There are blocks and chains reference in the paper, but neither as blockchain or block chain. Why? Because it was already invented, and hence accepted as a concept so no description was needed! The concepts of blockchain were already there since freakin 1991 (S. Haber and W. Stornetta), a paper directly cited in Satoshi's paper as a source. It was even improved several time, and used in application in 2005. Satoshi invented a novel way to use this for currency. There is also no reference to bitcoin in the Satoshi paper itself with the exception of the title. The paper decribe a peer to peer electronic cash system. It could be any coin, or any other system such as.  Bitcoin is just a brand and a usage, as currency, using the blockchain tech. Maybe you should read the paper, it is only 9 pages long. So no, blockchain is indeed the engine and bitcoin the car. ;1;1;False;Henamus;du8hkv3;Thought I might share this in here.

How many Electron apps solve a problem that wasn't already solved? I don't need a Skype that's slower or more IDEs I need to upgrade my laptop to use.

Maybe this is all old-fashioned, but I still care about power consumption in an age where more and more of my battery-powered devices are getting smaller and smaller. Developers should be racing to sleep, when instead they're just assuming everyone's either got 16GB of RAM or that their app is the only one running.

Edit: also, individual processor cores aren't getting faster, certainly not at the rate they used to.

"There’s a lot of options for how you can set up scalable applications. W3 Total Cache for Wordpress is a caching application that makes it so that Wordpress doesn’t have to hit the database every time a page is requested. Content distribution networks, like CloudFlare, are one option and host your content (think images, videos) on alternate servers so that your primary server receives less load, and they also serve from geo-specific data centers based on where the user is. ElasticBeanstalk is an Amazon AWS scalable server solution that’s relatively straightforward. More complex cloud applications use Chef, Puppet, Docker, Hadoop and Hadoop-related tools.

Which approach is used is based on the specific application, it’s specific server performance requirements and expected traffic.

Application specific caching extensions like W3 Total Cache
Content distribution networks like CloudFlare

Hardware ID locking is a horrible practice and really difficult to implement properly. If I upgrade my CPU, the hardware ID will change and I'll be emailing you saying wtf? You're better off limiting activation to a certain amount of devices and logging suspicious activations (with IP addresses) and acting accordingly. Furthermore, unless you properly secured your activation functionality, this is probably trivial to crack. You're essentially fucking over real customers and giving pirates a free ride.;2;1;False;;du8oaho;I've spent the last 4 months jobless building a Desktop Cryptocurrency Tracker: Moonitor.

I would suggest you rethink this.  I have a desktop, laptop, and mobile device.  Many other people will as well.  You should allow activation for up to those three accounts, with one being mobile-only.  If a new device is activated, then deactivate one of the original 3 so only 3 are live at any given time.;1;2;False;Jessie_James;du8p2cn;I've spent the last 4 months jobless building a Desktop Cryptocurrency Tracker: Moonitor.

Just an example: 

in the last 4 years I bought/traded BTC 100+ times. I now have overall 2 BTC, but I cant enter all the values of the trades since I didnt keep a record of it. It would be great if I could enter just the amount (2 BTC in the example) to keep track of the actual value now. 

This way I could enter all Cryptos I have, see the overall Portfolio Value, and since I know how much they costed me (estimation), still know how much the profits/losses are, without needing to enter every trade for every coin. Just an idea.

"Which architecture decision made it go slow by the way?

It just seems hard to make sites slow these days from spikes in traffic. If this was a static website served from S3 + Cloudfront, or heroku + Cloudfront it would be basically free (less than $7/mo) and not slow down at all.

Is it really the wordpress design choice and probably a server in a low memory VM?

Is it just because its a cookie cutter solution their web host provided?

Slow websites make me question my own design choices, but then I never experience these problems and theoretically shouldn't with auto-scaling. But I always think I'm going to eat my words as soon as I add some database w/o understanding a memory cache correctly or something.

I can tell you the one issue I've had with all other tracking methods is importing & coin/token availability. I use 10+ different exchanges and no one service I have found has import functions for all. Yes, some exchanges limit API functionality, so no fault there. Tokens, if listed on coinmarketcap or are in my ETH address, should be available (many others don't do this). Also, an import of the major blockchain addresses you hold would be nice (cointracking.info tries to do this but the available coins are few). Looks pretty but cointracking.info has loads more functionality for my tracking purposes. I would like something like you are doing, but it would also need a web presence (or at least a mobile app). ;1;0;False;whodkne;du8ucjy;I've spent the last 4 months jobless building a Desktop Cryptocurrency Tracker: Moonitor.

"Hey, we are currently finishing our 180-page book about cryptocurrencies which especially targets beginners and advanced users. We were not happy with anything currently available so we decided to write something on our own. Almost everything was not comprehensive, new or simply good enough. I hope no one here will eat me for writing about it. 

To come to the point: I will quickly quote our explanation what hardware wallets are:

> ""Hardware wallets are little devices, which often look like a typical flash drive and are the most secure type of wallets. They store the private key to access your wallet in a protected area of their controller and it is not possible to export the private key in plaintext. That´s why a hardware wallet is also called a “cold wallet”, because your funds are stored offline. It is like your actual, physical key to your wallet and people can only access your funds, if they get their hands on your hardware wallet. Even then they still need additional passwords to be able to steal funds from your wallet. Additionally hardware wallets can´t get infected with computer viruses or other malware (yet) and they usually offer backup functions. So if you really want to be in full control of your funds and have them stored at maximum security possible, then you should definitely get yourself a hardware wallet.

"Alright OP, so i took a look at the website and i see a lot of people complaining that you have to pay for it and the features are similar to existing apps... so ill do something better and tell you what would get me to pay for something.

* setting watches on payment addresses. I dont want to have to enter each transaction. blockchains are public. I should be able to enter a wallet address i cash out my exchanges to, and have my portfolio manager automatically pull coins from that and put them into my account.

* having a section to enter mined coins. Most apps only support you buying coins

* going off the last point, i want to be able to enter the cost associated with a mining rig, and track hash rate / profit, see my break even point, and have that point adjust based on crypto value. Again, the app should see the wallet my pool is cashing out to, and track this for me. I should be able to mark when i sell coins and have the break even adjust (say i spend 4k on a rig, i cash out 1k but bitcoin is staying constant to the usd. the break even plot should be linear. bitcoin tanks, the 1k i cashed out should still apply, but the bitcoin i mined and was holding should now show a downward trend on the break even, with a 1k offset)

* a way to enter coins without an exchange. I do transactions in crypto. If i buy hardware i shouldnt have to bs my transaction into my portfolio app. I should be able to submit a one time transaction thats not a trading pair. (ie, i should be able to say +.1 btc to this wallet, OR +.1 btc to this wallet with a monetary value of 900 usd)

* tracking the cost of compute hardware as well would be nice. GPUs might as well be their own trading pair at this point... i want to know when prices go up and down on hardware for buying new mining rigs. have some kind of alert on this.

* android app :)";2;1;False;motsu35;du90yq6;I've spent the last 4 months jobless building a Desktop Cryptocurrency Tracker: Moonitor. I'm not 16, my dog mentors me (true story) and no human touched/committed my code. Can I get some downloads/feedback please?;7xhkyv;https://moonitor.io

Would you compile it yourself?

Would you review the code?

Would you assume that somebody capable would review the code?

Being open source is by far not enough to be trustworthy.

Edit: Open source is a necessary condition for it being trustworthy but by far not sufficient. You would need code reviews by security experts and deterministic builds, signed by those researchers for every build all the time or in absence of deterministic signed builds, you would have to build it yourself but you would still need a trusted review of the code and every library it depends on.

"BTW, as a fellow programmer, let me remind you of one thing - avoid pissing off your clientele.  Annoying just one person can end up with 100 bad reviews and your project sunk.

Think long and hard about deactivating people.  You may want to come up with a solution that, for example, offers a free limited-feature account for people with 4+ devices (think dashboard only for excessive accounts), a discount for additional accounts, and so forth.

Long term, the best thing for you to do is simply get people on the platform at any cost - and I mean any cost *to you*.  Solicit feedback and ideas from all your users, and build them out but do so with a ""subscription"" model in mind.  Once you get to the 4-5 year mark of offering this service for free, you can then start to switch specific features to be ""Pro"" only.  Make it cheap at first, $25/yr or whatever.  

I did that very successfully with my last project.  The first 5 years everything was free, and then I migrated a portion to be ad-free if you paid (that is a simple start), and then added bonus features to paying users.  At one point I was making about $6k - $8k per month by having a $25/yr plan.  

But you HAVE to get a loyal client base first.  You do that by listening to them, tweaking, and making it better than anything else out there.";3;1;False;Jessie_James;du8r70y;I've spent the last 4 months jobless building a Desktop Cryptocurrency Tracker: Moonitor.

Funny... I have passed all 3 CFA exams. I’m pretty sure I know what I’m doing. I’ll let you know if I need help though /s. 

Like I said, you’re wasting your time, just trying to convince yourself that you are right. I’ve made up my decision based off of my sound background which has worked up until now.

Exactly, and so putting your money into a first mover is GAMBLING, not investing. ;1;1;False;DeathbyOstrich;du7y3bp;Millennials Love Bitcoin And Hate Stocks;7w4731;https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2018/02/millennials-love-bitcoin-and-hate-stocks/
"Not at all. 

There’s actually a stark difference: https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0512/investing-vs.-gambling-where-is-your-money-safer.aspx

One has odds linked directly to the performance of the underlying asset, on has fixed odds against you. 

You seem to show very little knowledge of either the protocol or investing. I’m sorry for that. Hopefully you can get out of your own way and learn something that could be useful for you. ";2;1;False;Auwardamn;du86nun;Millennials Love Bitcoin And Hate Stocks;7w4731;https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2018/02/millennials-love-bitcoin-and-hate-stocks/
"No, you clearly didn’t even read the article. The main difference between investing and gambling is that there’s fixed odds against you in gambling. There’s no such thing as a “safe” place for wealth storage. There’s always some level of risk. Even in bonds, there’s a level of risk. The difference is if the odds go low enough, your reward amount over time is outweighed by your loss amount, through the law of large numbers. 

9/10 startups fail, but that doesn’t mean that every single startup is a “gamble”. There are many factors that contribute to the overall end result of a startup. 

I’m not going to play some dick measuring game on Reddit of who has more investment experience, when you very clearly can’t distinguish between gambling and investing, and how risk/reward structures work, and simple statistical concepts such as the law of averages. Sorry. At this point, you are just making yourself feel good about responding. I’ve made up my mind about how I choose to allocate my resources according to my own risk tolerance and profile.

"Semantics. There are ""safe"" places, unless you are claiming in the broadest sense of the word that GOLD isn't going to be gold in some possible future event. Even though it's held value for 5000 years. 

What is the 'Risk-Free Rate Of Return' [Link](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/risk-freerate.asp)


The three-month U.S. Treasury bill is a useful proxy because the market considers there to be virtually no chance of the government defaulting on its obligations. 

In Gambling, the odds are not fixed in all games. Poker, had very volatile odds. And the House isn't even playing against you. Even Black Jack has odds that shift in the players favor.

If 9/10 startups fail, those represent clear ""odds against you"" in having investment gains.  

You clearly think you know more about investing than any professional, and we haven't discussed risk tolerance.  That's wasn't the point.  But for the average investor, cryptos are gambling. And you can find much better risk /reward structures outside of crypto. 

But if you're inclined to take higher risks, aka gamble, then go for it. There ARE people who win in Vegas.  Just like crypto millionaires. But please stop comparing cryptos to equities. they are very different.

Lastly, cryptos in relation to equities, have no inherent value. Whereas equity shares represent a share of a companies earnings/assets, cryptos have NO EARNINGS to share. They only have a price that is mutually agreed upon by a market place. Gold also shares this aspect. Bitcoin doesn't produce anything, it doesn't sell anything, it has no assets that it owns, unlike Apple . Which owns real estate,  sells software, hardware and intellectual property. And those things can be measured. Bitcoin does or has none of that.  And it's not healthy for average people to invest in it when much better alternatives exist. Such as scratch off tickets.
