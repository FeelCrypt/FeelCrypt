Honestly, I think you're onto something here. If BTC ever drops below $100, it would be in an single lightspeed spike to 0$ because someone cracked some weakness/code and can manipulate the entire system, thus making it worthless. I don't think this will every happen unless those early day miners do something crazy and all sell at once or a fundamental flaw in the algorithm is exploited or something, but that said, I think you're right about $5 days because it would never settle there. The big money is attempting to find the floor if a major but not crippling exploit is found. (basically, whats the worth of a first-to-market token?)

The April‚Äôs fool post was posted 17 hours before bitcoin  increased. It was April 2 when the increase happened. Not to mention that most alt coins are up 40% this month. If you think a post on Twitter caused a 19 billion dollar spike 17 hours later, you shouldn‚Äôt be investing money;2;0;False;xxjoker122;ejzb809;Good to see you again;b8ek6w;https://i.redd.it/owozm3bi6sp21.gif

"bull market?

Quick rally to 5k which I expected to happen if we break above 4200$ (the probability was low but possible)

We are already seeing resistance around 5k

RSI is showing massively overbought

We have 200Daily MA

Well, like the guy above said, if you bought a good altcoin it doesn't matter. People saying that all other altcoins are scams/crap are full of shit.
