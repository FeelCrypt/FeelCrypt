"Dear Pine,

Please consider a donation to the OpenLitterMap.com project - a citizen science game to enable anyone to map and open up data on plastic pollution anywhere & pay people in Littercoin for their efforts. 

Plastic pollution was first recognised to have a global distribution in the marine environment as early as 1975 (Rees and Pond, 1995). In 2010 alone, 8-12 million tonnes of plastic made its way from land to sea, which by 2025 is expected to increase to more than 70 million tonnes, assuming current trends continue (Jambeck et al., 2015).

Mapping and Opening up data on litter, plastic pollution anywhere will give the scientific and geospatial community the data needed to educate society and enforce better rules and improve public services, making our existing public services more cost-effective at stopping plastic reaching the ocean and saving us trillions in environmental damage.

There are now more than 50 trillion pieces of plastic in the ocean, more than 500 times the number of stars in our galaxy. 

We have not been able to stop plastic reaching the ocean. I would love to give the PineappleFund a chance to make a big impact by supporting the OpenLitterMap and Littercoin project!

"The value in crypto is the network.  The network provides a system of value storage and transfer that provides value in different ways than fiat currency or bank transfers do.

In its ideal form, crypto transfer fees are far less than VISA, banks, Western Union, or any other trusted intermediary.  Bitcoin is going through some growing pains at the moment, leading to high fees temporarily.

Security is another value provided by crypto.  A day laborer just outside of Cape Town, South Africa can walk or hitchhike into the city and work.  He can get paid to his Bitcoin wallet so he isn't jumped and robbed on the way home from work.  While he's at work, nobody can ransack his shanty and steal his money.

The unbanked and underbanked in Western countries have a way of keeping their money secure without significant fees.

On the not-always-legal side of things, the privacy aspects of crypto protect assets from forfeit and seizure, liens and garnishment.  This could be from the government, an abusive spouse, an unfair court judgement, or avoidance of a legal settlement agreement.

The privacy features that some crypto provide keeps your transactions truly private, as in, nobody can track them.  This is good for the privacy conscious or the criminal.

The security features protect you from theft - if you are savvy enough to manage your wallet yourself.

The integrity features prevent fraudulent transactions, with transactions being witnessed by multiple parties and signed.

The value features of known and limited quantities of crypto being issued means that no entity, government, corporate or other, is going to inflate away the value of your currency.

It's not that a single bitcoin has any particular value (it's just ones and zeroes), but the fact that it can participate in this secure, private network and facilitate value transfer is what brings it its value.

Is that value at $1 a btc or $20,000?  The market will decide.

That is half true.

If you have 10 new people price will go up as there's no only half a coin per person - it all makes sense.  
However, let's say there are no more than 10 people on the planet.  
The coins will be redestributed among those 10 people, one might have 5 and the other ones to have half each, or a few people to have 2 each and the other to have less than a half coin, etc.

You asserted that it will, or at the very least, that it will be surpassed by other cryptos and fall into obscurity.  That's a tempting line of reasoning:  We don't see the first iterations of most network goods around anymore- MySpace, etc.

But that's just one very small factor in a much bigger puzzle.  We do see some original network goods around when it comes to money; where network externalities are the most powerful (e.g. gold).  On the other hand; bitcoin is far from a money and does not serve well as money or currency right now.  That's in large part due to the Core fork (I subscribe to bitcoin Cash owning the rightful ""Bitcoin"" moniker, and it serves quite well as a currency), and due to some government's classifying bitcoin as a capital good for tax purposes (this borks all reasonable possibility to use it as currency legally, due to the tracking and reporting requirements) and other persecutions and interventions on the ecosystem.

But again, bitcoin has had 9+ years and almost every imaginable scandal and challenge thrown at it. . . and each time when it crashes, it never goes below previous low states, and it comes back and bubbles higher than ever.

I don't know if that's entirely good or bad.

I mean, go to zero and fall to obscurity, because of this particular hype cycle.

It's on you bud.  What is going to cause it to fail?  Even if it's just pure market irrationality that has carried it this far and this long. . . why not decades longer?

"Well said my friend, but one flaw of crypto to continue the discussion here. Is the fact if a power source were gone you would be unable
transfer and/or transact. A hard form of value/currency can function without this. I believe cryptos need an internet source to connect to the network hence another deficiency. And on the privacy coins etc.  Anything transacted digitally Is not feasible to be truly private. Anything can be hacked. It cannot until it is. I believe distributed ledgers will and can be hacked (likely are). Scarcity is another myth to a degree. When new white pages are created by the minute followed by a launch of another coin. With another purpose. With another setup. With another team lol blah blah. 

I see a mix of genuine excitement in crypto space, but one thing I see hugely missing mostly is informative talk. Message boards are surrounded with what appears young adults.

But growing pains indeed....right now maturity is lacking in crypto. Its only about the next moon shot and a fast buck.

"You forgot scarcity. The more rare a thing is, the more value it has. The scarcity is built into the mining and long term creation. The harder it becomes to mine compared to effort and electricity, the more the value will increase. When there are no more miners, then there is no more network, right? 

You forgot liquidity. I sure am reading a lot of ""I can't get my money and it's been over a month."" That's kind of talk drives value down. The more liquid it becomes, i.e. the easier it becomes to transfer and move around, the easier it becomes to spend, the more the value will increase.

You forgot safety. Cryptocurrency is for the most part unregulated. It's safe from government control. It's also isolated from government protection. That means if someone comes up with a way to screw you/me out of our coins and there's no legal recourse because laws to protect our value in crypto don't exist or can't exist. It will become really worthless quickly unless an easy concrete way for the dumb masses to make their value safe doesn't become obvious and easy. Every hacked exchange story, every fear of an unreliable exchange or unreliable wallet company story, every lost wallet story, every customer service nightmare story all drives the value down. 

You forgot confidence. All of this can go away tomorrow if enough people stop believing in it just like any fiat. 

I find it all fascinating. Perception rules us all. If the perception is that it isn't safe, isn't spendable, too volatile to put in amounts you are scared to lose, then it's value will disappear quickly. People here wouldn't be talking about boycotting if no segwit or lightning if there weren't problems that threaten it's value long term. You can say, well that's the exchanges, not the currency and that's true, but it's all part of the perception. What value is a currency that can't be hacked, but can't be kept from being stolen, tied up indefinitely, or hammered with unpredictable fees? What other unforeseeable growth and adoption issues lie on the horizon? 

Someone clever with the right backing could reinvent this wheel tomorrow and build on what has been learned so far. If they partner with a mega corp like VISA and the existing fiat infrastructure of banks and traders, and back it all with reliable government protection, ... well, who knows. We all know how some organizations obsess over control and like to keep the little guy firmly locked on the outside of systems of wealth and value. I am reminded of when Yahoo was king, and now Google reigns.

"I'm not savvy enough on investing/trading to speak to your arguments regarding crypto's status as a bubble/Bitcoin's obscenely high valuation, but I do agree that it has all the makings of a bubble (although, I bought it at a price that I doubt it will ever fall back down to, so I don't care to sell regardless of FUD). However, I do want to respond to the first part of your comment:

> Is the fact if a power source were gone you would be unable transfer and/or transact. A hard form of value/currency can function without this. I believe cryptos need an internet source to connect to the network hence another deficiency. 

This is also true of fiat currency, and should not be a ""flaw"" of crypto if it's a flaw of the entire market. The reality is that an internet/power outage powerful enough to meaningfully damage Bitcoin would also meaningfully damage most fiat currencies. In fact, due to just how widely decentralized Bitcoin and other cryptos are, I think fiat currency would suffer more.

> And on the privacy coins etc. Anything transacted digitally Is not feasible to be truly private. 

This isn't entirely true. The method by which MimbleWimble created transactions is a very secure form. If that transaction is sent into the mempool from a secure connection (such as a trusted VPN, Tor connection, or another yet-unreleased decentralized internet-obscuring service), there could potentially be untraceable transactions.

>Anything can be hacked. It cannot until it is. I believe distributed ledgers will and can be hacked (likely are). Scarcity is another myth to a degree.

This is kind of a vague statement, so it's hard to argue against (maybe intentionally). The type of public/private key encryption currently in use has ways of ""hacking"" them, via the use of brute force private key generation, but it's statistically impossible. Furthermore, Bitcoin users and developers will update the software to a newer variant that's even less susceptible to future vulnerabilities (one key example is quantum computing, which could be used to crack private keys, so there are already proposals for methods of generating transactions and blocks that cannot be mined by quantum computers faster than current hardware).

That's all I can think to address meaningfully. I think the key determinations most likely to impact Bitcoin's (and others') price is it's actually usability. If I can't send $100 worth of Bitcoin without including a $40 fee, or if the transaction is going to take days to send because I did not want to pay such a fee, then I'll use another service. 

A prime example of this is what's happening now on exchanges. It takes too long and costs too much to send Bitcoin from, for example, Coinbase to an exchange. Instead, it's easier to convert the Bitcoin to Ether, send Ether to the exchange, then conduct your trades in Ether instead of Bitcoin. 

I hope BTC gets fixed soon. It's greatest strength lies in its complete decentralization and the fact that it takes so much work for any modifications to get accepted across the community. The only problem with this strength is that the average internet user isn't going to care about these modifications to the same level as the users of last year and this year. As it becomes more widespread, it will get saturated with changes that less users will give attention to. ";1;0;False;phishfi;ds2l2tt;New Years Party;7ngg97;https://i.redd.it/ren31e10wh701.jpg
"> The network provides a system of value storage and transfer that provides value in different ways than fiat currency or bank transfers do.

Notice I used the word *different*.

All currencies / stores of value (slightly different terms but will lump together for purposes of discussion) have weaknesses.

Gold?  Portable in small amounts, unmanageable in large amounts.  Difficult to subdivide.  Security of it is both simple and difficult -- no need for fancy encryption and blockchains, but somebody busting into your home/safe can take it all.

Fiat? Depends on electricity too, as well as a stable government.  Unless you have buried piles of fiat in your backyard or stuffed them into your mattress, you are like everybody else, and has between $20-500 in your wallet at any given time, and the rest is locked in some digital spreadsheet managed by your bank.

As far as privacy and security goes -- nothing is absolutely secure.  Security has a set of economics associated with it, where the effort expended to attempt to break a security measure must be significantly less than the value of what's trying to be stolen.  Or, in other words, if buy a tank to break into a bank to steal $1,000, you are an idiot.

Hence, all systems can be broken at some level, but the crypto coins out there like Dash and Monero make that value proposition extremely weak.  Their privacy and security features make it extremely difficult and costly to successfully evade those security measures.

As far as scarcity goes, yes, anybody can create a coin.  With Ethereum, *that is by design*.  There is no limit to the number of coins in existence.  However, within each coin, the design of the coin protects its integrity with coin limits to build trust that the system isn't going to inflate away its value.  Fiat is inflated away *all the time*.  That's why our great grandparents paid a nickel for a Coca-Cola, and now you can get one for $2.25.

That being said, each system has their strengths and weaknesses.  One system that the US Dollar has is that if your money is stolen from a bank, you will be repaid in full.  No crypto system has any such ability to allow coin holders to be made whole in the event of theft.  Each system (even within coins) has its own features.

"Because the answer is that, bitcoin Cash (which I am referring to when I say ""bitcoin"") is not that poor a currency. . . not everywhere at least...It is in the U.S. where cryptocurrencies are being systematically hobbled.  But most importantly, and the reason why most of it's current price reflects speculation and not present use-value, is because a network good is necessarily only useful when it has a large network of people!  Bitcoin doesn't have a very large user-base yet (as compared to traditional currencies) and so is much more volatile and much less useful.  But we look ahead!  We look to the future (maybe only those of us who have a large enough neocortex apparently).  We fully understand and are aware that there is a coordination problem here, a classic market failure: wherein we need a lot of other people to hold this token, in order for it to be really useful. . . but it's hard to get a lot of people to hold this token, when it's not yet very useful.  That's why bootstrapping mechanisms are needed, including the volatility, which acts as a type of lottery, which is well known and widely used to produce public goods on the market and overcome free-riding problems.

I'm not telling you that you should invest.  But I am saying that the reasons one *might* invest mostly have to do with future value and utility.

Yeah but I don't think anyone should put any investment in anything they aren't willing to lose. At the current time you stand to gain way more money then you stand to lose. You could lose all your money in 3 years or multiply it by x times. If we assume that the odds of each happening are equal then it makes way more sense to invest and risk the money. You can't lose more money then you put in but the ceiling for how much you can make is infinite. ;10;3;False;troyboltonislife;ds2iubk;New Years Party;7ngg97;https://i.redd.it/ren31e10wh701.jpg

Sure those are to blame too but when I'm paying 0.5 mbtc for a miner fee to deposit why should I also pay 3x as much just for the privilege of depositing? Is that how the business model works or are they taking a cut of the trade? That makes it terrible to sell smaller amounts - total cost to get btc in there was going to be 1.9 mbtc.

It's not surprising given the general conversation in society where social media structures highlight the agitating and controversial opinions and more nuanced opinions are ignored. I just thought we were better than that.

I completely agree with what I heard, in person, Andreas say in one of his talks: we need to have sober conversations between people of different opinions instead of always assuming that the other group are genuinely bad people with the intent of making our world a living hell. Admittedly, this is a human trait (or flaw?), but it's nevertheless extremely bad for progress.

"They just announced this. Please start use segwit wallets so 90% tx are segwit and than we can talk. you think change will happen overnight? Beside, users and miners are at fault. check mempool and see what fees will push you through. Dont pay more than u have to and all will be good.

In Australia there has been a recent sweeping ban on bank transfers to exchanges being implemented by the banks themselves.

"Any chance they could look at the fee algorithm? 

I bought some coin during December, at a point where roughly 130sat/byte would probably get you in the next block. And 200 would have been slightly overkill.

The fee paid to the miners was around 900, which is absurd.

It's all well and good implementing Segwit, and I thank them for doing this. But they're still massively overpaying and charging the users for it.";19;2;False;Dickydickydomdom;ds2vgx5;Localbitcoins is now segwit compatible.;7nlvjv;https://twitter.com/LocalBitcoins/status/948146645723738112

"If a business has a liability in USD, the price of that liability in USD can change due to changes in foreign exchange. For example, one liability may be hiring workers and paying them in USD. If the USD depreciates against the euro, those workers travel to Europe to get jobs thereby decreasing the supply of labor in the US. Exposure to euro partially hedges against this.

The bottom line is that every business has different liabilities, costs, risk appetites, and therefore have different foreign exchange risk management policies. They don't all want to convert back to local currency.

"> If a business has a liability in USD, the price of that liability in USD can change due to changes in foreign exchange.

Which is why said business would immediately convert its revenue to USD, at least proportionally to how much of said liabilities are in USD, just like they'd convert part to Euro if part of its liabilities are in Euro.

> If the USD depreciates against the euro, those workers travel to Europe to get jobs thereby decreasing the supply of labor in the US. Exposure to euro partially hedges against this.

The labour supply is so inelastic relative to foreign exchange over short timelines that literally *nobody* hedges against salary competitiveness this way because it's totally pointless. Especially given that the Euro could just as well go the other way and US salary costs could still go up - it's not a proper hedge. The entire point of a hedge is to find something that is practically guaranteed to move inverse to your your liability.  

If you have spare cash sitting around that you can afford to take that risk with, then you have spare cash sitting around that you can put in bonds or other similarly safer alternatives that give a near guaranteed return. It's not perfect, but it's far better than trying to hedge a position with something that's not an actual hedge.

> The bottom line is that every business has different liabilities, costs, risk appetites, and therefore have different foreign exchange risk management policies. They don't all want to convert back to local currency.

Which is exactly what I've written over and over. Thank you for agreeing with my original position.
