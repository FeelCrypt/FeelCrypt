Monopoly was created in 1904 to demonstrate how rents enrich property owners and impoverish tenants. It's anti-capitalist, anti-bank.;1014;13;False;forgoodnessshakes;djyf906;What if the bank runs out of money;6m2btp;http://i.imgur.com/djrKAoW.jpg

"The limit of printing is the cost of paper. This brought the Weimar hyperinflation to an end, because the Reichsmark became an asset backed money again, backed by the value of paper. Of course a paper standard is not very convenient (consider the weight), that's why they switched to a debt backed currency. 

*The Monetary Mechanism of Stateless Somalia by William J. Luther,  Kenyon College*

*Abstract*

*A peculiar monetary institution emerged during the period of interregnum in Somalia from January 1991 to August 2012. Without a functioning government to restrict the supply of notes in circulation, Somalis found it profitable to contract with foreign printers and import forgeries. The exchange value of the largest denomination Somali shillings note fell from US $0.30 in 1991 to US $0.03 in 2008. However, the purchasing power eventually stabilized at the cost of producing additional notes.*

Rent prices in real life is about supply and demand. In Monopoly it is arbitrarily set by the game creators.
