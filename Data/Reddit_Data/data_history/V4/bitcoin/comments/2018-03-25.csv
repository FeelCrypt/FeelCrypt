"I think you dont get my point.


Linux is, like Bitcoin, in its current state not suitable for the mass. 


Im not saying this will never change. In fact, I think and HOPE I can use A Linux distribution as my main OS in the future.


There are many examples of why Linux is not suitable for everyone. Thus I don't think its right to judge someone based on their OS pick.


I give you an example of mine. I would love to switch and never use Mac or Windows again. Especially as a WebDev, Linux is super benificial.


My problem is that the designer I get my screendesigns from are working with Sketch, which heavily relies on the Mac OS X core. No chance of getting it to work on other systems. Yes, I tried online viewers but they don't offer a lot of functions I heavily rely on.


Point granted though, as a Webdev in general, Linux is awesome since it gives you the infrastructure your application runs on in the end.


The thing is, Webdevelopment is only a small part why I need my computer. The biggest chunk of it is Music Production, another former Hobby of mine which turned into a profession. There is no support whatsoever for Ableton or Cubase, two of the 4 or 5 major DAWs. Not even talking about all the VSTs which I need. 
Music production on Linux? Forget it.


Last but not least: Gaming. Not a core part of why I need my PC, but still something I enjoy from time to time. Yes, AAA titles are ported more and more for Linux but even then you will face a lot of problems. Just played Civ 5 with my friend on Linux and his game always crashed after a few minutes. Took him a while to figure out that his Linux Version didnt support 8 cores of his processors, so he had to write a script to make it work. Worth mentioning that he's a Dev too and he had to look into the error log to get hints to his problems. Sorry, but you cannot tell me that average Joe is able to solve problems like this, too. Also. I really enjoy indie games, which are most likely written by a small team without the resources to write a Linux port. 


As I said, Im not saying this wont change. You already see that things are starting to shape up, which is great. But you cannot tell me that Linux nor Bitcoin are suitable for the mass in its current state. There are just too many obstacles right now.

tl;dr: dont judge people by their OS. They may have a reason why theyre using what theyre using.";0;0;False;_open;dw97bux;Found a text exchange from 2013 I had. I wanna cry and punch my 2013 self :(;86stie;https://i.redd.it/cr3etka6kpn01.jpg

"I spent 2 hours in a hotel in NYC trying to buy $500 worth of btc at 11 cents each.

My visa card would not allow the transaction no matter what I did so I gave up and found some Russian college kid who I met at hotel bar which was midway between 80th avenue and times square on the west side. I seem to remember a red lighted sign and perhaps it was called the union hotel.

I ended up with these things called moon rocks which to this day was the best experience I have ever had before or since. No medicinal substance has ever approached how good they were.

I was with my then wife so being responsible I tested it out (without her knowing) just before we went to see the lion king.

I dislike plays and that sort of thing. This stuff kicked in on our walk to the theatre and oh my, we got in and when the music came on and those giraffe came out - the best moment of my life and I still get hair standing up thinking about it.

I could not contain my excitement & kept tapping my wife on the hand saying how awesome it was.
When we got out she said ""you have taken something haven't you"" 

Never touched drugs during our time together until then which must have been at least 12 years at that point.
The following night she had some and it was equally as much fun.

Anyway, even if I had have purchased my goods off of the silk road had visa allowed the transaction, even the pocket change left over, even if it was only $30 or so, it would have been life changing amounts.

This is all assuming I had not spent every cent of course but still, it is a regret that I have being I knew what btc was and what it was used for back in 2011.

No item in the history of mankind (as far as I am aware) has been so readily available & increased from its initial value so much as btc has.

I do not believe there will be anything in future that will come close to the magnitude of the rise or the relative speed that it rose. We missed the boat:(

"I see this sentiment a lot amongst the cryptocurrency community, but its the wrong way to think. Charlie T Munger calls it the Deprival Super Reaction Tendency, where one overreacts to loss of possessed, or nearly possessed rewards. 

Don't focus on what you could have done in the past, focus on what you can do in the present to positively shape your future. There is still lots of time to make an impact in the cryptoworld, don't waste that time beating your past-self up. Otherwise your 2021 self will be wanting to beat your current self's butt.
