">best part of american healthcare you can both be seen right away no need to wait.

This is bullshit. There are wait times in the US and they aren't all that different to wait times in other countries like Canada or the UK. Plus, it's possible for countries in Canada and the UK to be seen immediately without wait. What determines how much you wait is what kind of care you're looking for and it's availability.

"Your points are garbage.  You think things are fine the way they are.  Corporate America runs this war machine of a country and you just say ""well that's just the way it is."" You are a coward at best. 

Also, in a free market, if corporations simply passed the tax costs to their employees and customers one would be inclined to think that these people would seek employment elsewhere and buy different products.  Your whole pathetic arguement hinges on this ridiculous assumption that people will not act in their best interest.  I also never suggested raising sales tax.  Only raise corporate income tax and do away with individual income tax.  Taxing individuals on their hard earned wage is modern day slavery. Gtfo of here man.

Ok? I'm not sure how that's a response to any of my points. I already explained how corporations would just pass on any extra taxes to either their employees or their customers.;0;1;False;LegitosaurusRex;dnbbg7s;US bill has been made to remove taxes from BTC transactions under $600;70jw8b;https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/u-s-bill-would-ease-bitcoin-tax-regulations-for-small-transactions/
