"Yeah, that's not the same JP Morgan. Most of the penalties levied by the DOJ were related to activities at Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual. JPM was asked by the Fed during the financial crisis to buy the two companies to prevent a ""chaotic unwinding"" of the US economy. However, by doing so, JPM assumed the legal liabilities of Bear and Washington Mutual, which led to the DOJ levying penalties.

I'm not saying that JPM was totally blameless during the financial crisis - none of the bulge bracket banks were - but the DOJ fine isn't representative of JPM's activities.";42;5;False;nobloodyhero;dmxdlr0;"""My memory is failing, was it Bitcoin or was it JP Morgan that was bailed out by the government?""";6zpzdp;https://twitter.com/ErikVoorhees/status/907679079469654018

"Technically, and actually, it was Bears Stearns and Washington Mutual that did the shady, not JPMorgan.

[JPMorgan acquired them in 2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPMorgan_Chase#Acquisition_history), and so took on all their legal responsibilities while at it.

The full paragraph, of which you left out the important part when you quoted it, goes:

>On November 19, 2013, the Justice Department announced that JPMorgan Chase agreed to pay $13 billion to settle investigations into its business practices pertaining to mortgage-backed securities.[21] Of that amount, $9 billion was penalties and fines and the remaining $4 billion was consumer relief. This was the largest corporate settlement to date. **Much of the alleged wrongdoing stemmed from its 2008 acquisitions of Bear Sterns and Washington Mutual.** The agreement did not settle criminal charges.

Buuuuut, since they have technically, and actually, acquired Bear Sterns and Washington Mutual, then yes, they are now one and the same, although they weren't *then*.

"This seems a bit defensive. I'm not picking on one or the other. We already know what happens when one currency fails, and how it can have a domino effect on other currencies to varying effect.

Has anyone with actual serious global market experience done any models on whether having bitcoin or other cryptocurrency as the single global currency will reduce or increase the risk of fiat style economic collapses, and what effect we should experience?

For instance, would we see governments unable or unwilling to manipulate the economy to reduce the damage and carry a nation through troubled times? 

Would it result in a more extreme capitalist society than we have now? Would the banks make it simple for end users and run bitcoin in a similar fashion to fiat currency?

These are questions that should be asked. If you find them offensive, then you're letting loyalty emotions control your thoughts. That's a weakness you should work on if you're in bitcoin as an investor.

I've read a few books. JPM invented credit derivatives. They were also pretty crafty in passing the risk off their books onto other entities, like AIG. These are facts that are well documented. Just because they claimed not to need the TARP money, and even claimed they lost money on holding it for 8 months, the idea that they didn't want or need it is a half-truth at best. The purpose was to bolster Tier 1 capital across the board.

No one was complaining about their great returns on garbage subprime MBS leading up to the collapse.

"So strange how you're a sparsely used account with only two posts over 9 months before you jump in here with some ICO FUD.

An ICO has nothing to do with changing the structure of a company to public unless it that is the specific intent of the ICO.  The ICO is not an IPO in the sense you seem to limit it's definition to, it's a transaction type that can be used to sell company credits or other company managed products. Generally, it is a private transaction that's been made in a openly transparent fashion.

Banks are simply not needed at all in that sense, the legal framework you are trying to bolt in only occurs when a company is performing an ICO as a controlling instrument for the company rather than investment for a product or service provided, defined, and controlled by the company.

Did I miss something in my own review of the issues on this? So far, it just seems like a lot of people are trying to jam a star shaped peg into a quarter moon shaped hole when this stuff comes up. It only fits into your regulatory framework when you shape it into a device that impersonates another device in the framework you are looking at. You could use, and ultinately argue to outlaw, literally anything used to represent publicly traded controlling shares in a company. ICO is a multiuse instrument far beyond traditional stock shares.

"An example of other services banks like JPMorgan provides is the issuing of Initial Public Offerings(IPOs) onto the share market. For example, how much to price and value the share for, how many shares to release, the documentation needed to put a company on the share market. This process is lengthy and requires a lot of documents so these banks have people who are very familiar with the process.

In addition to that, banks will also help with the legal process of merging two companies. Or helping multinationals understand their tax obligations in different countries as well as ways to reduce their tax.

A bank like JPMorgan services a different range of clients compared to your regular national bank. I'm not sure where you're from so I can't provide more details but banks in Australia also provide wealth management, insurance and retirement planning services.

"**Bear Stearns**

The Bear Stearns Companies, Inc. was a New York-based global investment bank, securities trading and brokerage firm that failed in 2008 as part of the global financial crisis and recession, and was subsequently sold to JPMorgan Chase. Its main business areas before its failure were capital markets, investment banking, wealth management and global clearing services, and it was heavily involved in the subprime mortgage crisis.

In the years leading up to the failure, Bear Stearns was heavily involved in securitization and issued large amounts of asset-backed securities, which were in the case of mortgages pioneered by Lewis Ranieri, ""the father of mortgage securities"".

"[Neither](http://archive.boston.com/business/articles/2009/05/15/first_nine_banks_were_forced_to_take_bailouts/). You're thinking of [Bear Stearns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear_Stearns)^1, as well as Fannie and Freddie.

After bailing out three banks, the government was sick of it - and let Lehman Brothers fail. That was a ***huge*** mistake - which after caused the economy to almost die after 3 days.

Background
--------------


In the April of 2008, the Fed bailed out Bear Sterns, and then in the summer dealt with Fanny and Freddie. In September, Lehman and Meryll were in trouble. The Federal Reserve was sick of bailing out banks and they wanted to send a message: no more bailouts - no more money. 

Day 0 - Sunday, September 14th
----------------

On **Sunday** September 14th 2008 it was announced:

- Bank of America had agreed to absorb Meryll Lynch and all it's debt
- but also that Lehman Brothers was being allowed to die

Day 1 - Monday, September 15th
-------------------------

Panic. Lehman Brothers was allowed to die. If Meryll and Lehman could fail, who else might fail?
 Nobody knew who was next. Everybody was afraid to lend anything to anyone. Banks were no longer lending to other banks. The stock market crashed


Day 2 - Tuesday, September 16th
---------------------------

With the credit markets frozen, the insurance company AIG burned through it's savings and was about to become insolvent. The government bought up 90% of AIG, infusing them with $89B.

Day 3 - Wednesday, September 17th
--------------------------

The stock market crashed again - more. Credit was harder and harder to come by. Nobody was lending money.

Day 4 - Thursday, September 18th
---------------------------

Commerce is grinding to a halt. Everyone wanted their money out of the money markets. The Fed tried to infuse the money markets with $105B so people could continue to operate. The economy was in meltdown. 

We're no longer talking about mortgages, and big banks who had toxic assets. We're talking about every bank, that does anything, with anyone. **Nobody** could get a short-term loan.

- The safest, most rock solid banks could not borrow money. 
- You couldn't get a car loan.
- Small businesses couldn't get a loan to buy a new oven
- Corporations would not have been able to make **payroll**

Nobody expected that allowing Lehman to go into bankruptcy would cause a complete meltdown, but it did. And if it wasn't halted, the entire financial system of the United System would melt down in a matter of days.

Day 5 - Friday, September 19th
---------------------------

Hank Paulson needed to stop the meltdown. He needed to restore people's confidence **right the fuck now**. He wrote up a one-page memo, and went to Congress, saying he needs $700 **billion** in cash, and to have it approved before open-of-business Monday.

Without it: nobody would be able to get a paycheck next week.

Without bailing out the banks: the economy dies.

^1 Bear Stearns could have withstood the crash fine; they had enough cash reserves to cover all their toxic assets. It wasn't their loses that killed them - it was a run on the bank. On a Tuesday there was a rumour that Bear Stearns didn't have enough money to cover their loses, and everyone wanted their money out. There was a panic run on the bank. By Friday (three days later) they had burned through all their cash reserves and could no longer operate.

"I can't help but feel like this is caveman discussion . . .

""Bitcoin Bad."" ""No, Bitcoin Good!""

I'm a layperson, but how far off is this take on things:

The U.S. financial system has some really bad drawbacks. The 2008 crisis and ensuing recession exemplified quite a few of those drawbacks. 

This led to the rise of Bitcoin, which is a form of ""cryptocurrency."" Cryptocurrency is essentially digital money, and it's rise had been two decades in the making. 

Bitcoin relies on blockchain technology, a highly intriguing but controversial system that has a lot of potential uses. 

Bitcoin as an investment is high risk, because no one can predict the future. High risk implies high reward, meaning that investing at the right times could lead to considerable profits. It also implies the potential for big losses, meaning that the golden rule of investing applies, as always: only invest what you're comfortable losing. 

The future of Bitcoin is unpredictable. Investors hope it will continue to thrive, while fiat currency advocates continually allude to its inevitable downfall. 

While Bitcoin's future is unclear, the fact that big players in the established banking system have been experimenting with blockchain technology for years, as well as the current trend of digitization, means that the future of cryptocurrency itself is somewhat more clear: it is, almost certainly, the future of money. 

Will Bitcoin lead that charge? Or will it falter under pressure from many sides, and go down in history instead as the precursor to 21st century cryptocurrency and the widespread use of blockchain technology? 

There are no answers to these questions. Yet. ";2;0;False;;dmxton1;"""My memory is failing, was it Bitcoin or was it JP Morgan that was bailed out by the government?""";6zpzdp;https://twitter.com/ErikVoorhees/status/907679079469654018

You can easily tell which crypto is the real deal because Bitcoin is under constant attack, the others hang out in the sunshine, with no negative press. Even in the face of obvious ICO scamming, ether price barely fluctuates, no negative attacks, and now Vitalik goes on a road show, walking back the absolute junk he helped put in place. With no scathing critique like Bitcoin constantly receives. The point I take away from this fact is that Bitcoin is the 'REAL DISRUPTER' Of the untrusted systems, and some of the others are decoys.;2;1;False;askme2b;dmxap4k;"""My memory is failing, was it Bitcoin or was it JP Morgan that was bailed out by the government?""";6zpzdp;https://twitter.com/ErikVoorhees/status/907679079469654018

">  because the financial crisis didn't hit them so hard because they invested relatively lower risk compared to other banks. 

I do not think its because they invested in significantly less risky assets than most of their peers.  It is probably because they were one of the main deposit taking banks in the system, such that JP Morgan's liquidity improved in the GFC, as concerned depositors withdrew from other smaller banks and money market funds.

For example:

* In December 2007 JP Morgan had $741bn of deposits, more than the $520bn of loan assets, a ratio of 1.42x

* In December 2009, JP Morgan had $938bn of deposits, more than the $633n of loan assets, a ratio of 1.48x

I think JP Morgan did engage in illegal practices, including having bad, fraudulent and over valued mortgage assets on its balance sheet, just like its peers.  The government effectively bailed the system out by introducing new liquidity into the system, which pushed up the value of these, as well as other, assets.

I would not say its true that JP Morgan has had significantly fewer  violations than its peers:

"Shows what a moron Jamie Dimon is and how little he actually understands what currency is.

From a pure historical and theoretical standpoint digital crypto currency makes sense.

During the agrarian economy the currency was a reflection of that economic epoch.  People (not governments) used the products they raised or cultivated as currency.  Trading furs for food, food for tools, animals for supplies.  It was a barter economy based on items that reflected the agrarian epoch.

During the industrial economy the currency was a reflection of that economic epoch.  Currencies were printed and minted using technology of industry to produce paper and metal currencies.   Made sense because you can't really carry 1,000 chickens around in your wallet to buy that new Model-T Ford.  It was an industrial economy where the currency was product of the industrial epoch.

Durning the digital economy it only makes sense, therefore, to have a currency that reflects the digital epoch.  If not bitcoin, then some other digital currency is theorized to emerge in order to serve the needs of the digital economy.

Where Jamie Dimon's logic fails is where he doesn't even realize that bitcoin makes JP Morgan obsolete, and the factors that he uses to make an argument against bitcoin are the very reasons why bitcoin, or something like it, it necessary.

1. He says bitcoin is not backed by any government.  Of course not, nor should it be.  Just like the Internet that is ubiquitous and distributed and not controlled by any single government, you would theorize that a currency for the digital age would likewise be universal and not controlled by any single government.

2. His idiotic statement: ""You can’t have a business where people can invent a currency out of thin air and think the people buying it are really smart. It’s worse than tulip bulbs, OK?""

What is the U.S. dollar if not printed out of thin air.  The U.S. Treasury just finished several years worth of creating money out thin air - they even have a fancy name for it ""Quantitative Easing"".  

What Dimon the dunce seems to ignore is that it is the two parties in a transaction that determine both the nature and the value of a currency.  If the two parties in a transaction are willing to accept digital currency then the value of the currency is established. 

3. Dimon the dunce also states ""It’s a fraud, OK?"".  The only currency that is a fraud is a currency that is created and manipulated by a central bank. Quite the opposite it is quite impossible to commit fraud with blockchain and bitcoin because a single actor such as a fraudulent bank like JP Morgan is not able to manipulate the system.

Perhaps Jamie Dimon, the dunce, is simply having trouble coming to terms with the immutable fact that BitCoin already has more customers globally than JP Morgan does, and that JP Morgan has lost their ability to defraud BitCoin customers the way JP Morgan defrauded their mortgage customers.

"In my experience, there are two modes of thinking here: cypherpunks and their followers who exist in a world of secrecy and a copious amount of paranoia (built up as a result of the things they've had to do in the past to enable civilian level cryptography, mixed with their deep understanding of the broken systems that currently holds our data together)... and there are those computer scientists who see a world where the crowd is rapidly electing to drop the need for secrets and privacy because of the increased social capital and reach they enjoy through networks that encourage collaboration and openness (like facebook, twitter, github).

In the wake of the Equifax data breach, it is clear there needs to be another step before those two worlds can work together in tandem, which I would see lies with something like Blockstack / Rootstock allowing the crowd to migrate their data from centralised platforms and gatekeepers so that we can ensure the integrity of personal data.

This leads to things like a global digital passport (for use on and offline) linked to social karma capital similar to what we see on reddit, and various levels of encrypted data layers giving those we trust access to things like medical records and financial data.

As the above system evolves this leads to a level of transparency on the individual, corporate and government record keeping level that means we are all incentivized to play fairly with one another.

We must also think about how things such as forced economic migration is set to be disrupted by all this when the 70% of the world (some 3-4 billion) without access to the internet or global economy, suddenly skip all the intermediaries and have access to all of the above with nothing but a $20 smartphone.  We can imagine some kind of global kickstarteresque / openbazaar like programme that enables Westerners to push economic energy into entire third world countries (and reaping the benefits of trade) without needing to ask permission from a single gatekeeper anywhere in the economic chain.

TL;DR: A bit of both is necessary at this stage, but one would envisage long term, the 99.9% of good actors that make up the bulk of humanity would elect for total transparency in all affairs (albeit via various tiers of encrypted data layers) meaning that 0.1% who would choose to hide in the shadows have nothing to gain by trying to cheat the system.";13;1;False;smeggletoot;dmya7dk;JPMorgan CEO: Bitcoin is Fraud.

"Why does it make more sense to have the government manipulate interest rates than it would to have it manipulate commodity prices?

When a commodity price rises due to increased demand or reduced supply, more investment is directed toward that commodity, which increases supply and lowers the price.  Its a self correcting mechanism.

When a person with a business plan needs a loan to build a product or service and they approach a person that saved some money, the saver will judge how risky they think the business is and adjust the rate they are willing to lend at accordingly.

When the average interest rate (across recent lender/borrower deals) in a given sector of the economy goes up, that indicates that the amount of risk the business plan in that sector has gone up.

This sends a signal to both lenders and borrowers about that sector relative to other sectors.

What is the point of defeating that signalling mechanism by manipulating interest rates?

I think damaging bubbles are a likely result of attempting to lower interest rates below the level they would be at if borrowers had to deal with savers that couldn't print money and had to save money before lending it (or convince savers to let them invest it for them) and were not so big that they knew the government would have to bail them out.";2;1;False;SilencingNarrative;dmyquos;JPMorgan CEO: Bitcoin is Fraud.

"Those shielding assets in Venezuela and other places suffering currency pressure would disagree with you.  It is *really* important that we stop thinking about where we are TODAY and think to where this technology will be in the world of TOMORROW.  Yes there are teething problems (because it needs to scale, because 1000-3000 users a DAY are coming to this reddit wanting to USE bitcoin).  Meanwhile, things like Lightning, Blockstack, Rootstock, movements like Bitnation and myriad other developments are working round-the-clock to evolve this technology further.

The most eloquent explanation for all this came from Chamath at facebook, which he laid down back when bitcoin was something most hadn't heard of.

[Facebook Executive says Bitcoin Is Gold 2.0 - It's a Huge, Huge, Huge Deal!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6iIhooV8UY).

""I personally own Bitcoin in my hedge fun, I own Bitcoin in my fund, I own Bitcoin in my private account. It is a huge deal. It's a huge, huge, huge deal. Because what you're talking about right now is, for the next three to five years, an unbelievably better stored value. It is gold 2.0. Right? The value of gold that hedges the world economy, about $9 trillion, right? Thirteen hundred an ounce, of which only a hundred to a hundred and fifty dollars is the actual production value. So all the rest is imputed.... Well, guess what? I can do the same thing with Bitcoin only I can do it outside the purview of every single government. It's being used everywhere you would think it would be used. Russia, Iran, Iraq, Egypt, Venezuela, Argentina. Everywhere you have currency pressure. Everywhere you want to basically shield your assets. And then, after that, it will probably become a payment mechanism."" — Chamath Palihapitiya

So, have patience, let the ecosystem develop and worry not about the opinions of those who have little expertise in the fields of computer science or internet.  Worry even less about those who aren't visionary enough to see the world in which bitcoin exists tomorrow.

"At the end of the day, the most loved things don't need to be sold.  Google doesn't need to advertise google search, Piratebay didn't need to advertise, Popcorn time didn't need ads to go viral, Github has no need for a global marketing push... Same with Linux and the internet itself.  

When bitcoin has done advertising, there's been a wonderful playfulness to it, or they have been virals made with love, by the crowd and the users themselves.

By contrast, Ethereum has used multi-million dollar ad budgets to sell the ideas of multi-million dollar corporations born off the back off ICO's and old world shareholder agreements.  We see a diamond logo representing status and privilege, the DAOHub resurrecting religious TAOist symbology (DAO means the source of everything) even going so far as subverting [sacred religious symbology](https://forum.daohub.org/uploads/default/original/1X/a567a82712cc69be8c42e05f04c6691cf168f10f.png).  That worries me because, not only is it offensive to the original context of those images and ideas but, if you know your history, it's exactly what Hitler did with the Swastika (he used an old Taoist symbol knowing it was already imbued with power, and turned it slightly).  Not that I'm saying the marketing teams behind ethereum did any of this with malign intent.  It's likely more naive ambivalence to our cultural histories.

Note that even Ethereum's answer to the Lightning Network - Raiden - uses the name of the [Streetfighter character](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/34/b1/c6/34b1c6175e8b7c33884c0c741f53c67e.jpg) that fires Lightning.  Either this can be construed as a snide little in joke or the exact same willful appropriation of symbols from the past that imbue great power over the psyche of individuals on a subconscious level.  

All that niggles me in the exact same way that cynical dark magic marketing tricks such as the McDonald's ""I'm Lovin' It"" slogan troubles me since it is this very dark art that has lead a Western world into rabid over-consumerism through this stimulating of artificial needs and wants.  A world of greed that, if bitcoin network infrastructure pans out as many of us hope, bitcoin will be the very antithesis to.

I have no personal interest in buying the minds of others; be that through paying people to be stuck in a cubicle developing code they could be writing on a beach, or buying gigantic billboards that weave dark magic into the public consciousness.

There's a great [short essay](http://intellectual-thoughts.com/Alan%20Moore%20Quote.htm) here by Alan Moore that covers this stuff.

> Btc might be the wise old man but, then again, eth also might be the disruptive innovator.

Sure, I have no greater insight into where all this leads than anyone else and I wish all those involved in ETH the best of luck, and offer them the same level of heart-on-sleeve advice (for what it's worth) as I do anyone who approaches me in this space.  It will certainly be interesting to see what impact Blockstack, Rootstock, Lightning Network and Atomic Swaps will have in this space and what it means for ETH and the myriad alts out there.  All 'sides' have a lot more work to do if we are to seriously see this as a technology being adopted by central banks and governments, alongside the 'ordinary' masses.

As to where I fall: I pledge allegiance to bitcoin because of the people involved that I have been there with since the beginning of all this; and who I know have been through hell and back for this technology, risking life and liberty in order to pave a safe passage to the many new entrants (eth included) in this space.  I have seen the developers of Rootstock cry during their presentation because of the mountains they've had to climb for this technology, and that really tells us how much bitcoin - the idea means to the people most shaping its future. 

We can be thankful it is those early bitcoin pioneers who were brave enough to stand up and say ""enough is enough"" at the very beginning of all this, and risked everything to get bitcoin to where it is today that are not only steering the good ship bitcoin but who - as people - I know for a fact care very, very deeply about the world and the future of our species; people who have cried tears of sadness and joy many times along this journey and will pull out all the stops to ensure bitcoin thrives.  Not because of a paycheck, but because of an idea.

Ultimately, this all comes down to the innate goodness of the people involved and their willingness to collaborate and share ideas freely with another in order that we may build a better world for EVERYONE with this technology; whilst having a lot of fun along the way and going to bed at night feeling they've made the world a better place.  You can't put a price tag on any of that.

"You might ask yourself why so many are still here working their arses off, given the meteoric rise in price that would mean nearly all those who started this project could have retired long ago.  You also might wonder why it is - given all the various crashes in the past - that those same people still continued on through thick and thin way, way before many of the people commenting here obsessed by price had even heard of bitcoin.  Perhaps the same reason great artists still make music after multi-platinum selling records?  Perhaps, there is more to life for some people than money?  Could it be?

These are groups of people who took very great personal risks in ensuring this idea survived and laid the way for (and invested in both monetarily and cognitively) - things like ethereum.
 
You may ask yourself too, why so many of those original bitcoiners continue to hammer home the message that the price - whether it is $1 or $1m - is just a distraction.  There is a reason, after all, that [this is the most enduring bitcoin meme](https://i.imgur.com/gE8hDnY.jpg).  

Most who have done well in this life will tell you they got there by solely focusing on helping others...  Bitcoin, like Ethereum, is just a tool; it is the infrastructure, ideas and people who believe in one another and what the future may one day look like... that will see their ideas flourish and achieve the greatest good for humanity as a whole.

The truth is, a good portion of those involved at the very beginning of bitcoin had already gotten 'rich' through their internet ventures or simply from the fact they were already in really well paid computing jobs (Mike Hearn as one of Google's security chiefs working in bitcoin in his spare time is a good example).  And so money and personal gain had never been a factor in bitcoins early development… any more than money was a factor for the founders of Reddit,  Hacker News, Wikipedia, Popcorn Time, Piratebay, IRC, Linux, Last.FM... the list is endless.  

Programmers have always been a caring, sharing bunch in love with their art.  Way before the internet we had the Public Domain where home computer aficionados would freely share their code and show off their creations.  You only need to go on stack exchange to see how this has evolved; just how much ideas and solutions are shared for the love of helping others in their own creations.  There's nothing quite like the rush of building something beautiful and seeing others fall in love with it (be that music, an invention, a house you built by hand, or an internet site).  

The 2008 crisis was a wake-up call for many old neckbeards and computer scientists who had been thinking very deeply about the worlds problems since the 90's...

Crypto Currency, Universal Basic Income, Resource Based Economies were not new ideas.  Nor was the concept of an internet powered by micropayments as opposed to advertising (this was always supposed to be how websites were funded).

And so yes, many involved are here - believe it or not - because they felt a duty to fellow humankind to help shape the internet and new technologies that will get us toward a world of free association where we no longer have to live in a demon haunted world propagating fear, poverty and greed as if that was some kind of universal law. 

Sounds utopian, but so did the concept of the welfare state and free healthcare for all before the Brits went and did just that after WWII.  A system that is taken for granted today and works in many western countries very beautifully.

Can't speak for your own vision in this space, but me I see very clearly that world of abundance around the corner, a world where going to the moon and living on mars is a thing we can all strive to do in our lifetimes, once the measurement tools required to galvanize the human energy needed for those grand public good projects have been fixed.

Most of us, when we really think about it all gazing up at that grand cosmos... just want to know if we are alone in the universe.  

Can't say exactly how we'll all get there I just know, if history tells us anything, the future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of those grand dreams.

"Thanks for the kind comments :)

I've played a somewhat active role (albeit from the sidelines) in both worlds, and was amongst those bitcoiners that helped fund ethereum via their ICO because I think we should be supporting any and all who want to push this technology to its limit.  I was also present at the ethereum Barclay's launch in London and whinced a bit at one of the young kids onstage who, replying to someone in the audience who asked ""What's to stop JP Morgan forking this technology and doing their own version?"" to whit the guy replied ""Nothing.  But guess what?  Ethereum's the only game in town.""

I believe it's that kind of hubris that got us all in this mess in the first place...  But hey, they are youngsters new to the internet who are rightly excited about this amazing stuff they've all built, so their hubris can be forgiven (I hope that doesn't itself sound condescending).

Criticism aside, I think ETH has played a valuable role in forming a sort of walled 'technology sandpit' where finance incumbents can experiment and learn about the tech, safe in the knowledge there's hierarchical leadership and a Swiss foundation backing things up, meaning barriers to entry (and risk exposure) are lowered.  

It's also taken the heat off bitcoin being the 'only game in town' and with it, the speculation, bitter attacks, and businesses that see bitcoin as a threat (and blockchain as just another tool for bigger, faster, stronger profits).

With that we have seen the rise and fall of DAOhub (which was primarily focussed on ROI) and witnessed lots of slick marketing agencies and 'decentralisation' hype which has flooded into the ethereum ecosystem...  Which then lead to the latest ICO frenzy (which feels a lot like the dotcom frenzy of the 90's).  

Ethereum's walled technology sandpit is predictable and comfortable, its governance makes sense to the old world; much like the iPhone App Store might feel more comfortable in the hands of your Grandpapa over a rooted Android phone...  So all this has created some nice paying jobs for designers, coders, marketing firms and so forth on the ETH side...  and, just as with the jobs created in the dotcom crash, those skills *are* going to be needed in the future, regardless of how this plays out.  Especially when things like Solidity language support is ported over to rootstock.

Meanwhile, bitcoin is the 'slow and steady' tortoise to the ethereum 'move fast and break things' hare...  In that sense, it's a tale of inter-generational and idealogical differences (""save the world and get 'rich' doing it"" vs. ""save the world and create a resource based economy where no-one needs to be 'rich'"", ideas borne of those hackers and tinkerers that built the internet on the maxim ""information wants to be free"").  

One scheme has to be built with love, the other can be built with money.  One side will see artists, musicians and bitcoin dilettantes spreading the message through their art, embedding the meme in movie dialogues and holding up 'buy bitcoin' signs in FED meetings; the other side will need to pay for billboards and product placements in those movies and tv shows to capture public awareness...  One side 'feels' right and good and exciting to be a part of for the common masses at large, the other feels like a shinier reflection of the old world using the same marketing tricks to sell us into the ideas of a few men and women stamping NDA's on everything that comes through their doors.

The truth is, whilst we still have one foot in that old world of 'for profit' gatekeepers that revolves around ROI and vested VC interests; it's going to take awhile yet before those ugly addictions to money and power and ""please sir can I have more?"" can be truly transcended by a global crowd that no longer needs to seek permission from anyone but the global network itself... to trade freely with one another in ideas and energy.  For that, we each, as individuals, have to step up and realise we always had the 'power' to trust one another all along.

Bitcoin is messy, chaotic and unpredictable... and yet - at its very foundation - stable as a rock *because* of the leaderless 'chaos' that lends to the ecosystem itself having to find the optimal solutions...   This anti-fragility imbued within a consensus-driven development process is bitcoin's *real* breakthrough...  Its ability to take onboard a whole plethora of differing opinions and voices and - through that diversity of ideas - grow ever stronger and more confident (albeit slowly and cautiously).  But what gives bitcoin its greatest strength is the people in love with bitcoin - the idea; people who help shape its future every day, and whose enthusiasm and lust for real, positive change is contagious.

And it is for that reason you will *never* see an ethereum symbol [spray painted on a wall](http://3u1bxj4dc91n2voz2e27rlg0.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/six-two/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/020-1024x683.jpg), [embedded in children's cartoons](https://i.redditmedia.com/gktLkGY31YQj7rqKICCQmW9IPFRMvTdJgf4Y2a9v35o.jpg?w=320&s=7815532197456870e7e0a9b25b9b08f3) or [lovingly pasted into public spaces](https://i.redditmedia.com/NqGL1tgQr0CLAiIIKckU1AfXbG3LyKvNC8zONOh1_6s.jpg?w=320&s=71e42ee6d1d1c8df21b018dbbbcdf433).

I think in years to come, as we finally put this era of the ""passing of greed"" and artificial scarcity behind us, and realise we live in a world of abundance that merely needed a better measurement tool... we will look down from our rocket ships at this pale blue dot of ours, and wonder why it took so long for us to get there when it was so obvious, in hindsight, that money was nothing but a collective delusion holding us all back from the cosmic revolutionaries we always were :)

"The biggest problem I see with the gold system of the 1930s (as you say, pegged to gold) was that it was a fractional reserve gold system.  The U.S. had printed more paper notes than it had gold to redeem, which is unstable.  When too many people try to redeem their notes for gold at once the system collapses.

I don't know how you can force a government to not print more notes than it has gold, though, so I think 'the gold standard' is a moot point.

"The moment musicians, artists, movie directors and ordinary people started sewing the bitcoin meme into the fabric of day to day reality, was the moment bitcoin 'made it' as the defacto new world currency of choice.

Whilst many have missed the importance of people like Louis CK accepting bitcoin, TV shows like the Good Wife, CSI, the Simpsons, Mr. Robot and Ben 10 embedding bitcoin imagery in their works of art, those who were here in the 80's understand that all this has happened before and humanity has already ""backed"" bitcoin in all its messy, chaotic anti-fragility.  

If we computer scientists could go back in time would we rebuild the http protocol?  We sure would, because all those various threads that hold the internet together are far from perfect.

Young companies and individuals vested in this space, must do their very best to learn from that early internet history; and in doing so help us all avoid mistakes borne of fear and greed that lead to things like the 'browser wars'.  That means embracing collaboration over competition, which is something I see time and time again happening in this space.

We get there by remembering this is what bitcoin is really about:

"I think Quorum is an interesting technology, and not necessarily inconsistent with his position on bitcoin.

Quorum is essentially an ethereum fork that operates on proof-of-authority instead of proof-of-work. Essentially you can have a consortium of businesses running their own nodes and signing off on each successive state. Each member of the consortium signs off on each state change, thus nobody in the consortium can later claim they weren't informed of or disagree with the outcome of something that happened on the blockchain.

So for example, rather than using the current Automated Clearinghouse, which takes a surprisingly long time in the modern era for transactions to complete between banks, a consortium of banks could elect to settle up through a contract on Quorum. You could do similar settlements for other assets like stocks, bonds, commodity contracts, etc. And without proof-of-work, block times can be pretty low.

Notably, Quorum is only intended to help a consortium of groups agree on state changes. It doesn't come with its own currency that they're trying to get people to assign value to, it's just a mechanism for distributed consensus, where ""distributed"" is a much smaller scale than Bitcoin or Ethereum try to operate on.
