Ideas like this make me think you don't really understand what Bitcoin is or what it can become. Just because lots of libertarians on /r/Bitcoin make ridiculous statements about Bitcoin taking over the world does not make it so. 

I'd recommend listening to the technologists and venture capitalists when it comes to Bitcoin as they actually understand the implications of the technology. Or do you think they are investing more into Bitcoin than they did the internet on a comparable timeframe for shits and giggles? It is the same names which developed the Internet which are now involved in Bitcoin. 

>Bitcoin as an asset will be speculated on for years until it reaches a semblance of stability, at which point the allure of going ""to the moon"" will wear off and plenty of speculators who were more invested in the price of bitcoin than the utility will pull out.

The unit of account is the least interesting part of Bitcoin yet it is the part which everybody focuses on. If that all Bitcoin was you'd be right... But that component pales in comparison to the transactional network and what the implications of that network are. 

Listen to Marc Andresson, read what Wedbush and BOA said in their reports on the technology. They don't focus on the unit of account, because it's largely irrelevant to the business end of Bitcoin.

"So, I just peeked at [the industry standard on credit card agreements](http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0213-lost-or-stolen-credit-atm-and-debit-cards). Up until now I was focusing on bank account ID theft, but whatever. You want to choose a narrow sliver of the argument to wax about, you'll still be wrong on that little hill, too.

It says that zero liability *is only possible* if you report identity theft *before absolutely any fraudulent charges occur*. Other limits up to and including Full Customer Liability revolve around how long you wait *after receiving your card statement*, which is why one of the first things an ID thief will do is make certain the statements for fraudulent cards they take out in your name go elsewhere, and/or sometimes they'll steal them directly out of your mailbox. You can't see statements online for newly issued cards that aren't linked to your online ID, so by the time you know a few hundred thousand of fraudulent shit has been run up in your name on a card you've never heard of *it's too late: now you're on the hook for it*.

So tell me ""go back and read your agreement"" as much as you'd like.

"Nope, not liable. This is why credit cards are great - they are essentially a contract between you and the bank for each purchase you make. You are only liable for contracts you complete, obviously.

If (and this is a big if) you wait long enough with fraudulent charges this could be considered acceptance, but seriously, if someone is stealing statements out of your mailbox then that's a clear mitigating factor.

Your link is irrelevant - identity theft encompasses a wide range of crimes. I'm talking about fraudulent charges on a credit card - which you are not liable for, period. If a bank bullies you into accepting them that's one thing, but the beauty of a credit card contract structure is that you clearly are not.

"Right now Bitcoin can save 2-3% over the [*fees*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SneZwjkOYIc) levied by Credit Card companies, however those fees do *zilch* to protect the vendors bottom line from buyer fraud.. [so that gets built into the cost also](http://uptweet.com/viewStory?id=606).

When I worked at T-mobile as CCR in 2005-2006, we learned that they had a ""risk assessment team"" of ~8 people who's job it was to try to pre-emptively determine who would try to pull credit card fraud on them in order to head them off at the pass, and to quantify how many fraudulent payments the company had to eat in order to keep revenue above this expense.

Seasonally, fraud made up between 10% and 15% of T-mobile's credit card revenue.

That means they had to charge everybody 10-15% more than they would otherwise have had to to stay afloat, and [until Jan 2013 VISA and other credit card processors strong-armed all merchants into being unable to offer discounts for cash or other less lossy forms of payment like cash or Bitcoin](http://usa.visa.com/personal/get-help/checkout-fees.jsp). Today that pressure against the vendor has finally been finally rendered illegal.

So if the vendor pays ~3% in fees plus 10-15% to cover fraud and-or to pay inhouse anti-fraud task forces, then even if Dell and NewEgg are only offering 10% as a promotion I do believe they would be well served to cut the customer in on some of the savings in order for everybody to keep more of their hard earned cash instead of relying upon *intentionally* leaky payment systems. For the time being, I bet they are just dipping their toes into the water to see *how* every single practical factor adds up before committing to any sorts of discounts, promotions or endorsements of a payment system they've never really relied upon before.";1;1;False;jesset77;cj1d9qx;DELL is now the world's largest ecommerce business to accept Bitcoin!;2b1zhh;https://twitter.com/MichaelDell/status/490162239983599616
"The sheer volume of transactions Dell does makes any fraud insignificant.

Anyway, it doesn't matter, merchants don't choose the currency, consumers do. If your store only accepts wampum, consumers will shop somewhere else. If your store doesn't take PayPal or credit cards, consumers will shop somewhere else that lets them chargeback. Businesses must entice the consumer, not the other way around.

Is a 10% discount (and I agree that number is just a marketing ploy, standard rates would just be 2-5% off fiat prices) enough to persuade customers to lose the ability to chargeback and instead figure out a currency that is hard to understand and set up for someone not familiar with technology or computers?

Well I am a small retailer, and I am sure credit and payments are somewhat easier for big well established retailers, but I constantly have issues with getting payments to manufacturers or distributors quickly because they will not ship until I do, and while I usually have estimates they don't always let me know the total cost until everything is ready to go.  In some cases I have had to pay significant extra charges for them to take a credit card, in order to not wait for a check or wire to be processed.  I imagine processing speed is at least sometimes an issue for big retailers as well.

"I'll be honest... I didn't see that one coming. And it is a genuinely impressive move for Bitcoin. The large Bitcoin sign ups that have happened before have either been also rans like Overstock or pisspoor companies like Tiger Direct or Dish Network. Dell is incredibly unexpectedly huge.

But that still does not validate Bitcoin as a payment method or as a currency. Acceptance is just one piece of the puzzle; the intrinsic issues with Bitcoin still remain - it is still economically brain dead, it still relies on the goodwill of anonymous people you have no recourse against to process all transactions, it still provides no recourse for consumers against merchants who screw them, and there are still no coherent non-ideological reasons for someone to buy it to spend with over using the money they already have. So /r/Bitcoin is right to be excited, because in all fairness to you guys this is a big big move for Bitcoin, but you should not lose sight of the fact that as a payment method and currency intrinsically Bitcoin still has a long way to go, and Dell's acceptance will likely not help that.";0;0;False;HistoryLessonforBitc;cj1ndn2;DELL is now the world's largest ecommerce business to accept Bitcoin!;2b1zhh;https://twitter.com/MichaelDell/status/490162239983599616
